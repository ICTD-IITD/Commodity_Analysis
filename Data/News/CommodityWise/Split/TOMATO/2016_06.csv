However, there is some good news, too  the fruit will be much sweeter this summer.Grape production has come down by 15 to 20 per cent in the areas the fruit is grown in Bengaluru Rural such as Devanahalli, Doddaballapur, Nelamanagala and Hoskote, according to the Horticulture department officials.The area under grape cultivation has also reduced, say officials. Devanahalli and Doddaballapur, which register maximum grape cultivation, have seen a decline this year.Last year, the area under grape cultivation was 2,300 hectares in Devanahalli, but this year, it has come down to 2,150 hectares. In Doddaballapur, too, the area under cultivation has reduced from 80 acres to 15 acres, said a Bengaluru Rural Horticulture department official.The heavy November downpour destroyed seedless varieties of grapes, which are harvested only once a year. The area of cultivation has also come down as farmers indulged in growing vegetables such as pole beans, tomatoes and other leafy vegetables this year. They also grew guava and flowers, especially Marigold. In Doddaballapur, many farmers are a part of the mango cultivation and expansion programme and this has resulted in the reduction of the area under grape cultivation, the official added.Speaking to Deccan Herald, K M Parashivamurthy, Additional Director (Fruits and Floriculture), Horticulture Department, said the total area under grape cultivation in Karnataka is 20,000 hectares, of which 2,500 hectares is in Bengaluru Rural. The demand for wine grapes has increased because of the growing market for wine products. Farmers and wine companies have tie-ups, he added.Sweeter harvestS V Hittalmani, former additional director, Horticulture department, said the grape produce is sweeter this year due to the early onset of summer. Normally, grapes are grown in hot and dry regions. This time, because the heat was more, it has helped increase the sugar content in the fruit. As temperatures rise, the sweetness will also increase during the course of this summer, he said. Meanwhile, grape production has not taken a hit in north Karnataka regions such as Vijayapura, Bagalkot and Belagavi."
5928f0c07be9e0137c781bb2,Way to redemption is through listening,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/559757/way-redemption-through-listening.html,2016-07-24,,Deccan Herald,"Way to redemption is through listeningManisha Sethi, July 24, 2016 0:08 ISTFor the past few days, commentators have been scrambling to explain the tumultuous outpouring on the streets of Kashmir following Burhan Wanis killing, refusing to wane under either bullets or pellets.The first response generally is that of absolute and uncomprehending bewilderment. The second of outrage and indignation: look at them mourning a declared enemy of the state, look at them pelting stones at the army. The third is to fall back on the familiar, comforting narratives. Here, one has the luxury of drawing upon layers of sedimented common sense.When our group, Jamia Teachers Solidarity Association, was compiling cases of malicious frame-ups by the Delhi Polices elite Special Cell, we discovered that in 18 of the 23 cases the Special Cell had passed off Kashmiri businessmen, students, and sundry travellers passing through New Delhi as Hizb or Lashkar operatives.Who would after all raise doubts about these Kashmiris terrorist links? No one did. Between Kashmiri the terrorist and Kashmiri the stone pelter is a difference only of degree in our common sense. Both are ultimately unreasonably opposed to our nation. Both are prone to violence.What has been laid bare in the days past is the intimate link between gross institutionalised communal prejudice that exists in India and the militaristic response to Kashmir, of both, the state and its propaganda underlings, the assorted experts and TV anchors. Night after night, stars of television news scream into the camera that the stone-wielding teenager is either a shield for a terrorist who hides behind him or a Jihad-crazed maniac radicalised by a virulent form of Salafism which has supplanted the earlier gentler Sufi traditions.Nice, Syria, Bangladeshand preacher Zakir Naik thrown in for good measureare all linked up to proclaim the onset of a global jihadist project in the Valley. Leaders and anchors excoriate anyone grieving the blindings and the killings: troubled by blood on the paved road? Where is your patriotism and loyalty towards the uniformed men?The events of the past fortnight, the explanations and the manic commentary around it, hold up a mirror to us, not the Kashmiris. And the image in that mirror is grotesque. We have turned into primal hordes of automatons, exulting in blind jingoism. We are being asked to not feel pain. On the contrary, to take pride in these nationalist kills. We are being asked to abandon understanding, and empathy. We are not to ask why thousands of young people throng the graveyards to offer prayers for Burhan Wani. Indeed, it is not relevant to seek the roots of their rage, a rage so seething that it has inured them to all danger. What matters alone is that Kashmir remains the crowning glory of our sacred map.When an army veteran writes a letter to the dead Wani, warning himbut really, the warning is to those in the streets because the dead dont read lettersthat the Indian Army will kill you, he is talking to us too. He is asking us to corrode our humanity, to leach ourselves of any sensibilities. Death is all that they deserve, even desire. Even to those of us who may be ambivalent about the meanings and consequences of Azadi, it is obvious that Kashmir can only be held by force, awful brutal force.It is immaterial whether pellets can be substituted by a less lethal, non-lethal method of crowd management. Democracy in Kashmir will continue to be endless crowd management, and management of dead bodies and graves. Do we want blood on our hands? Remember that war always comes home. It brings with it its logic and symbols.Technicolour nationalismWhy has the prime minister called upon his workers to undertake tiranga yatras at this moment? The directions are quite specific: BJP leaders are expected to carry flags aloft on an 8-feet pole, ride a two-wheeler, and chant Bharat Mata ki Jai. It is to be a spectacle par excellence. This technicolour nationalism fluttering in the air is meant of course to validate the war in Kashmir, but also to protect the gau rakshak vigilantes who skin Dalits and lynch Muslims, to prepare us for a possible aerial bombing in Chhattisgarh, to render us quiescent in our own surveillance, to normalise, even legalise, communal profiling and to ratchet up the already skyrocketing defence budgets.Possibly at the very moment Wani was shot down by security agencies, I was reading a brief life sketch of Pt Rughonath Vaishnavi by his granddaughter, the anthropologist Mona Bhan. Vaishnavi was a vociferous advocate of Kashmiri nationalism.His paper Jamhoor (Democracy) was banned in 1952. Vaishnavi was jailed repeatedly over the next few years and his habeas corpus petition was rejected on grounds that the protection flowing from the Constitution were not available to him.His writings bear witness to midnight arrests and detentions of Kashmiri partisansthrown into dark cells without being assigned any reason. Vaishnavis life and writings force us to look at the past and our present anew, and to imagine possibilities other than those thrust on us. Is it not possible to excavate these histories, to complicate the army veterans understanding of Kashmir as an artificially manufactured conflict with no history and no legitimacy? Perhaps, it is possible to pause for a moment and turn off the jingoism and simply reflect on the unfolding tragedy.Let us not allow these deaths to become bald and sterile statistics. Let us not allow the Indian states hubris to blind us. Listen to what the Kashmiris are saying  not because it will change official policy, but because in that conversation lies our, and Indias redemption.(The writer is the author of Kafkaland: Prejudice, Law and Counterterrorism in India)"

Tur dal prices hit Rs 150 per kilogram, while prices of urad dal crossed the Rs 150 mark in the wholesale market on Friday.Tur dal prices hit Rs 150 per kilogram, while prices of urad dal crossed the Rs 150 mark in the wholesale market on Friday leaving the state administration worried.Officials from the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Vashi said the price of urad per kilogram had risen to Rs 158. Its true that urad dal price has shot up this week. The rates of all pulses have risen by at least Rs 5. And, it is likely to increase further in coming weeks, said an official adding that tur dal price per kilogramme on Friday was around Rs 140.However, price in the retail market was more than Rs 200 per kilogramme, admitted the official, adding that shortage of pulses has led to a rise in prices. Another official said vegetables too are witnessing a shortage and rise in prices. The supply of vegetables such as tomato, brinjal, potato is deficient. As a result, average price of vegetables has shot up to Rs 30-50 per kilogramme now, said the official adding the prices were between Rs 10 and Rs 30 per kilogramme in April. The vegetable prices are also likely to increase further, he said.Watch Video: Whats making newsOfficials attributed the shortage of pulses and vegetables to the drought resulting in low production across the state. While weather officials projected a good monsoon this year, its onset has been delayed.In the cabinet meeting earlier this week, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis directed the authorities to step up efforts to boost supply and check hoarding. A report tabled in the cabinet meeting stated that retail prices of vegetables have seen a 21-28 per cent jump in the past week.Fadnavis has directed Food and Civil Supplies Minister Girish Bapat to rush to Delhi to convince the union government to okay a higher buffer stock of tur dal for the state. While the Maharashtra government had raised a demand that the Centre should release 20,000 metric tonnes of tur dal for the state, sources said the Centre has so far agreed to release just 700 metric tonnes. Bapat proposed that the state government should import tur dal. The state administration is not entirely in favour of the proposal. Bapat was unavailable for comment.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The Khar police station registered a case against Mumbai-based Poncho Hospitality Pvt. Ltd, which owns and operates a quick service restaurant (QSR) chain under the brand name of Box8. Unknown employees of the company have been booked for offences affecting public health and safety under the Indian Penal Code.The incident occurred on Thursday afternoon during events organised by the India International Model United Nations (IIMUN), a non-political network of students. Nearly 4,000 students from different colleges were part of the seminar at four venues. About 1,000 consumed the lunch, police said.According to statements recorded by the police, the organizers said the food was manufactured and packed in Bandra Kurla Complex. Investigations, however, reveal the food came from Thane, said Police Inspector Dinesh Kadam of Khar police.We have not yet made any arrests. We are following logistics chain of the food unit and looking for lapses. Prima facie it appears the food was spoilt due to a delay but who is responsible has still not been revealed from our investigation, said a senior police officer.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday carried out an inspection of Box8 factory in Thane from where the food parcels, containing rajma, rice and tomato curry, were prepared. We are inspecting how the food was prepared, if any sub-standard procedures were followed. The premises are being checked for hygiene, said Suresh Deshmukh, joint commissioner of Food at FDA.On Thursday, samples of food and vomit were collected from the event venue and sent for lab analysis at Kalina, police said.According to Jinay Sheth, a 15-year-old student from Green Lawns High School, he experienced stomach pain half-an-hour after lunch. He could smell something foul in the parcel but he was so hungry he did not suspect the food had gone stale, said his grandfather Mukesh Sheth.Jinay first later vomited. By 3.30 pm he was rushed to Jaslok Hospital by event volunteers. On Friday morning, he was discharged. According to doctors, he was put on intravenous drip but did not require a stomach wash.Divya and Vanshika Rajpariya, in sixth and eighth classes of Whistling Wood school, were lucky. They got delayed at lunch and were later given pizzas when organisers realized the food was stale. By the time my children reached for lunch, they realized something was wrong with the food packets as other students had started complaining, said their mother Trupti Rajpariya.The organisers stopped the remaining students from consuming the food and subsequently ordered pizza for lunch. On Friday, pizzas were again ordered for participants but the number of students who turned up for the event had reduced by half, organizers claimed. Of the four admitted to Jaslok hospital, two were discharged on Friday. According to medical director Dr Tarang Gianchandani, no one was critical but two students will be kept under observation for another day. At Bhatia hospital, two students remain admitted but were said to be stable and recovering well.Meanwhile, a statement from Box8 read, We are deeply concerned about news report of illness caused to some students yesterday. Box8 maintains rigorous quality process through preparation of food and delivery system, including tasting the food before serving, which too was followed yesterday without any adverse results. Matter is being inquired by the authorities and we have been fully co-operating to identify the cause. Once the cause is identified Box8 will spare no efforts to deal with the same.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

5937322c7be9e015d564a60d,Charda village: Dalits stood up here and got village to rally behind them,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/dalits-stood-up-here-and-got-village-to-rally-behind-them-2969616/,2016-08-12,,Indian Express,"No untouchability in village now: Sattuben (left). Express Photo by Javed Raja No untouchability in village now: Sattuben (left). Express Photo by Javed RajaAbout 100 km from the India-Pakistan border, in Tharad taluka of Banaskantha district, Charda village witnessed a revolution of sorts over six years ago. A Brahmins buffalo had died and he called the Dalits to clear it. They refused. Since then, Dalits here havent skinned or cleared a single carcass.There was a fight and we decided not to do it anymore. The buffalo lay there for two days, till the owner buried it himself, says Mulabhai Mansinh Bochiya, a Dalit who was in his second term as sarpanch at the time in 2009-10.I was made the sarpanch for the first time on a savarna (general) seat in 2000, when the incumbent sarpanch, from the darbar (OBC) caste, was booked in a murder case within six months of his appointment. Rajputs and darbars are the dominant community, but the village voted for me again, says Bochiya.At a time when attacks on Dalits have led to a widespread outrage, particularly after the public flogging of seven Dalit youths in Gujarats Una for skinning dead cattle, Charda is on the cusp of change, although there is still some way to go.Bochiyas wife, Sattuben, assures that there has been no untouchability in the village since the buffalo incident. But 15-year-old Bhavna Desai, a member of the cattle-rearing Rabari (OBC) community, who spends most of her time at the Bochiya home, says it does exist subtly in the privacy of homes.For instance, they (Dalits) cannot come into our temple, and they do not come anyway. At community get-togethers, they sit with their community members, not with us, she says.A student of Class VIII, Bhavna says that in school, however, everyone sits together and dines together, and this has been happening for as long as I can remember.Sattuben and Mulabhai have six sons and two daughters all of whom are married. Unable to accommodate everyone in one home, the family moved to a plot where they used to store fodder, on the outskirts of the village and have one bigha of land in which they only grow cattle feed for their buffaloes, says Sattuben.All the sons are labourers and do canal-work, she says. The Narmada canal which connected this taluka has come as a blessing to the village. We laid a pipeline spending Rs four lakh to connect to the fields, says Sattuben.But if they (government) evicts us we will have to leave, because this land is not ours, says Sattuben.Her daughter-in-law Jasaben says their staple food is bajra and mung and potato. Rice is made only on occasions, unlike the Desais and the Rajputs in the village, who also eat wheat and vegetables like brinjal, and tomatoes, she says.Bhavnas father Nagjibhai Desai lived in Shilaj on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, taking care of a cow pound till about ten years ago. Then came the Ring Road (Sardar Patel Ring Road), and Ahmedabad became a mega city, and here we are back home to farming, says Desai.He raises cattle and sells milk to the Banaskantha dairy co-operative. Untouchability, he says, does not exist at all in Charda, adding that everyone clears carcasses.Pointing to the children gathered around his home, he says, Look, all of them are Dalits. Can you tell the difference between them and us? If you cut any of us our blood will be red. They all eat together play together. Those who believe in discrimination, may practise it (untouchability). We dont.Shankarbhai Prajapati, an OBC who has been Chardas sarpanch for the last five years, insists that the village has changed. Only last week, my buffalo died, it was worth Rs one lakh. I called a tractor, tied and dragged it, loaded it and buried it with some salt for faster decomposition, he says.Govindbhai Rajput, a farmer, blames politics, for the discriminatory practices. People working on the directions of the Congress and the BJP practise untouchability, because they have political interests. We have no enemies. There is no issue at all. In our weddings, they (the Dalits) play the drums and get Rs 25,000-30,000 for it. Brotherhood is what we believe in, he says.Nanjibhai Adhial, who works in Tharad for Dalit rights as part of the Ahmedabad-based NGO Human Development and Research Centre, says that much has changed since awareness came in.But the awakening has come with its own set of issues, he says. Today, if a Dalit is asked to shut up in a panchayat meet, he will object, and then the oppression begins. Earlier, he would sit quiet, he says.Banaskantha District Collector Jenu Devan says the district administration tries to get communities together at gram sabhas to overcome discriminatory practices. In schools, we have successfully managed to finish it. We have ensured that children sit together and dine together. Our teachers mostly come from towns where untouchability is less and they are partners in this effort, he says.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Here is the complete transcript of the Prime Ministers interview with Arnab Goswami.ARNAB: Prime Minister Modi thank you very much for this interview. Thank you very muchPM MODI: My greetings to all the peopleARNAB: This is your first one to one interview to a private news channel since you became Prime Minister. And if I am not mistaken, this is the first ever interview by a sitting Prime Minister of India to a private television news channel in the country. So I would first like to thank you and am very grateful for the opportunity.PM MODI: The world of the media has grown so big that everybody has to attach themselves with it.Watch Video: Whats making newsARNAB: I am very grateful and our viewers will be very grateful also Mr Modi because they want to hear your views on a range of subjects. Mr Prime Minister I would like to start by taking you back to 20th May 2014. The results came on May 16th. Four days later, you gave a historic speech in the Central Hall of Parliament and you were speaking to the members of Parliament. You had said four days after the results that an era of responsibility has begun. And that you said that in 2019 before the elections, I will come back to this Parliament, I will come back to the MPs and I will give my report card. Forty percent into your tenure, how much have you achieved of your own targets?PM MODI: When I went for the first time as an MP to the Central Hall, and it was the first time I was seeing the Central Hall. I had not been there before. So I had then said that becoming the Prime Minister was not about the designation of the office but it was about the responsibilities and work of being a PM. I had also said that my government would be committed to the poor. I was completely new in the job. Delhi was new for me. The Delhi environment was new to me. The work of the government of India was also new for me. But despite that, in such a short time, the pace at which the country has moved forward, and its not on one subject. You can pick up any aspect of the governments functioning, and if you make a comparison with the past governments, then you will realize that no issue has been ignored. There has been an effort to bring in something new in every area. There is an effort to bring in change in every area. One big challenge was that I was not experienced about this place, I had not even been an MP. The office was new, the questions were also new. But when I look at the second biggest challenge, we should remember those days when the country was engulfed in disappointment. The everyday news was about whether there would be any electricity production after seven days, whether coal would be supplied or not. This was the situation then. The entire system was engulfed in disappointment. The big challenge was to inject new trust into the system and create confidence among the citizens. It is very difficult to evaluate this from the outside but I have gone through it. But today I can say with a lot of satisfaction that now there is no trace of any disappointment. The intention to do something is visible. And its not in words but in actual achievement. I had said that within a given timeframe, we will open bank accounts for the poor. For something that had not been done for 60 years, setting a timeframe for it was in itself a risk. But because of that a trust was created in the system that it was something doable. So thats the process I started for awakening the confidence. And today you can see that in every sector, the changed circumstances can be seen. While evaluating the performance of this government, never forget that you will have to make that evaluation in comparison with the 10 years of the previous government. Only then will you know where we were and where we are now. We should not be talking about what we are aiming for. For now you will have to assess the present in comparison with the immediate past and in that you will find a bright future.ARNAB: Mr. Modi, I want to start now on the issue of foreign policy. In the area of foreign policy, you have taken great personal interest. The amount of personal interest you have shown in foreign policy, probably none of the previous Prime Ministers showed the same kind of interest. Your approach is pro active. What I find interesting about your foreign policy is that you have balanced different powers and different interests. On the one side, your relationship with US, you made sure that India enters the Missile Control Technology Regime with them. A week before that you also signed the historic Chabahar Port Agreement with Iran. So, you have balanced very diverse forces. My question to you over this is that, is it easy to do that as an Indian Prime Minister? Secondly, on the issue of the NSG, you staked a lot of personal interest, personal push, you lobbied actively. How close are we to getting the NSG seat?PM MODI: Firstly, about foreign policy, you need to know what has strengthened our foreign policy. For 30 years, in our country, the government was unstable. For 30 years, party with a clear mandate wasnt given the opportunity to form the government. The world measures the government of a nation on the basis of its condition in its own country, on how strong their word is in their own country. I am thankful to the people of this country, that after 30 years, they chose a government with absolute majority and this has had an impact on world politics. Countries and world leaders have changed their perspective towards India. This is the biggest benefit. Secondly, the world didnt know me. The world wants to know who the head of the state is. If someone would want to know Modi through the eyes of the media, then he would be disillusioned on which modi is the real Modi. If this happens, the country will be at a loss. Modis personality shouldnt be a hindrance for the world to have faith in india. But for that unless I meet all those leaders and engage them them one to one, unless I speak to them frankly, they wouldnt know about indias head of state, so it was very important for me as I am not from a political family. I never had the opportunity to meet the world leaders earlier.ARNAB: You were an unknown entity in foreign policyPM MODI: More than foreign policy it was foreign relations. Yes, I was new to it. So for me, being pro active was mandatory. Thirdly, we work as a team. Foreign ministry, Prime Ministers officer, commerce ministry, finance ministry, defense minister, everyone works as a team, not as separate pieces. The impact that is now visible, is not just because of Modi, it is because of the team. All teams work in a particular direction. That is why the impact is seen, earlier these teams were splintered. We have seen instances where the party would give a statement, the prime minister would say something else, party leaders would say something else. This disunity has had a negative impact. Thirdly, we also need to understand that earlier the world was bi polar. Foreign policy would be centered around two super powers. India was a little late in realizing that this bi polar situation was for namesake. Now the entire world, in changed circumstances, especially in 21st century, it is more interdependent and inter connected, earlier, the foreign policy was possible between governments, but today it is not possible just between governments. Government relations are important but increasing people to people contact is equally important. Theres been a shift in paradigm. Because I do not have any previous baggage, because Ive had a clean slate, I write everything from beginning and that has a benefit. Today we are building relations with countries across the world. The amount of respect with which I engage saudi arabia, I engage Iran with the same amount of respect. The amount of respect with which I speak to America, I speak to russia with the same amount of respect. So we need to understand this. We also need to understand that we shouldnt consider smaller countries insignificant. I abide by this principle. The small countries of the world are as important as the big nations. We had assumed that the relations with smaller nations would develop under the shadow of the bigger nations. I brought about a change in this. You must have seen that I made a forum for the pacific island nations. We have had two meetings. I went there once and they came here once. These are small countries with a population of about 10 lakh or 20 lakh. But these small island nations are most affected by global warming. When india took up the international solar mission and 122 nations joined it, the island nations benefitted the most out of it. They are 50 in number now. A group of 50 nations, feels secured with this vision of India. If we try to understand this change, then we would realize that in the world, a few days back, I was sitting with the officers of our foreign services, so as we got talking, in a very poetic way I told them that there was a time when we used to sit by the sea and count the waves, but the time has now changed, we are done counting waves, now its time for us to steer ourselves, ride the waves and decide on our direction, destination and speed.ARNAB: That is apparent. You have a very aggressive foreign policy. But my second question was, you put so much effort for NSG membership. My question was, how close are we to NSG membership and were you disappointed that we did not make it at the very end because of Chinas opposition?PM MODI: Look the first thing is that India has been continuously making these efforts, no matter which government was in office. Be it the membership of the UN Security Council or the SCO membership or MTCR membership or NSG membership. Every government has made an effort. Its not that only this government is trying, its in continuity. But its during our tenure that we achieved SCO membership, we also got the MTCR membership. I have full faith that now we have begun a coordinated effort for the NSG membership too. The process has begun on a positive note. Everything has rules and will work accordingly and move forwardARNAB: Is it the problem of mindset with China? There have been 13 engagements at various levels between the Narendra Modi government and the Chinese government. The latest engagement was when you went to Tashkent. You spent some time with the Chinese President Xi Jinping. Yet it was seen that in the case of Masood Azhar, China blocked Indias UN bid to ban him. Now they have stalled Indias NSG bid. Why is China repeatedly blocking us Mr Prime Minister despite your personal proactive measures and your governments outreach?PM MODI: The first thing is that we have an ongoing dialogue with China and it should continue to happen. In foreign policy its not necessary to have similar views to have a conversation. Even when the views are contradictory, talks are the only way forward and problems should be resolved through dialogue. We dont have one problem with China, we have a whole lot of problems pending with China. Slowly and steadily, an effort is on to address these issues through talks and make them less cumbersome. I can say that China has been cooperating with India to search for solutions. On some issues, its a question of principles for them. On some issues, its a question of principles for us. On some issues they differ with us and there are issues on which we differ with them. There are some basic differences. But the most important thing is that we can speak to China eye-to-eye and put forth Indias interests in the most unambiguous manner. We are a government that takes care of Indias interests. We dont compromise on this. Three days ago I met the Chinese President. I told him clearly about Indias interests. They are a different country, we are a different countryARNAB: Do you think you will be able to change their mindset on the issue of NSG membership?PM MODI: See the foreign policy is not about changing mindsets. Foreign policy is about finding the common meeting points. Where do our interests converge and how much? We have to sit and talk with every country. Its our ongoing effortARNAB: This statement that you just made is also apt in the context of America where you gave a speech in the U.S Congress. By the way Mr Prime Minister it was a fantastic speechPM MODI: Thank youARNAB: There was a lot of humour. You were laughing and cracking jokes while you delivered the speech which was very unique. They also appreciated it. Was the speech impromptu?PM MODI: I have a humourous side but these days humour can be a risky thingARNAB: Why do you say that?PM MODI: In this era of 24/7 news channels, anybody can lift a small word and make a big issue out of it. But I will tell you the truth, the reason for the absence of humour in public life is this fear. I am myself scared . Earlier when I used to make speeches, I would make it so humourous but there would never be any issuesARNAB: Have you become more conscious now?PM MODI: I am not conscious. I am in fear, there is no humour left in public life because of this fear. Everyone is scared. I am in fear. My speeches used be humourous. I see it in Parliament, that humour is finished there too. It is a matter of concern. I will quote one proverb.ARNAB: Yes, go ahead.PM MODI: Even if you mention a proverb, they will connect it with something else and begin a conversation. The one who is saying the proverb does not know for what he is speaking.ARNAB: But you should not lose your sense of humour Mr Prime MinisterPM MODI: But it is true that my trip to the United States of America, my speech in their Congress and the respect shown towards India created a lot of hype. Had it not been hyped so much, there would not have been so much criticism on the NSG issue. Government is being criticized not for any mishandling of the NSG issue but because we were so successful over there (in the USA)ARNAB: Did China become conscious of your growing friendship with US?PM MODI: I am talking about whats happening hereARNAB: But when you delivered that speech in context of America, you used a very interesting phrase. You said We have to overcome the hesitations of history. My Hindi is not that good. Like hesitations of history. But my question to you is Mr Prime Minister, how close can we get to America because many Indians believe that America is still supporting Pakistan, giving them military assistance. How close can we get? At what point do we stop before we are seen like an American ally? What is your own world view on that?PM MODI: I would especially like to appeal to my countrys media that we should stop looking at everything in India from the . India is an independent country. It is a country of 125 crore people. Whenever it approaches any country, it will only be concerned about its own interests. It has been our biggest shortcoming and mistake that we have been tagging ourselves with another country and trying to do things. We are an independent country, we have our own policies and future. We have to think about the future of our 125 crore people. There should be no compromise on our interests. We have relations with America in the context of these fundamental pointsARNAB: How close can we get to them?PM MODI: There has been warmth in our relationship. You must have seen the editorials in American newspapers after my visit to that country. One point mentioned in those editorials was that the success of Obamas foreign policy has been the warm relationship with India. This has been saidARNAB: What you are saying Modiji is that we can be close to America but we need not be an ally or seen to be an ally?PM MODI: The first thing is that we no longer live in a bipolar world. The world is interconnected and interdependent. You will have to connect with everybody at the same time. Even if there are two opposing countries, they will have to be friends. Now the times have changedARNAB: Mr Modi, on 8th May 2014, I had the opportunity to interview you, the interview took place in Ahmedabad, I think one last phase of elections was left. We were discussing the issue of Pakistan. You have had an uncompromising approach towards Pakistan. Two days back, Lashkar E Toiba killed 8 CRPF jawans in an attack. In the 8th May interview, you put forth a very interesting phrase, you said Can talks be heard amidst the noise of bombs, guns and pistols? This is how you had phrased it. Do you believe we have been too generous towards Pakistan? Do you believe we have been too generous towards Pakistan?PM MODI: There are two things. One  India has always wanted friendly ties with its neighbours, there can be no debate around it. We want to live in harmony and peace. And I have said it repeatedly, that India has to fight poverty, Pakistan too has to fight poverty, why dont we come together to fight poverty? I said this before elections and during election campaigns. Also I had invited leaders of SAARC nations to my swearing in ceremony and they had attended it as well. So there has been no change in our intent, our thoughts and our current behaviour. Number two  those who have to work from the table, will work from the table and those who have to work at the border, will work at border with full strength. Each one will fulfill the responsibility entrusted to them. And our jawans are fulfilling their responsibilities. Its true that pressure on terrorists has increased, their schemes are proving unsuccessful. The intent with which they move forward are foiled and they have to face major challenges. It is because of this disappointment that such incidents are taking place and our jawans are risking their lives and protecting the country. We are very proud of our JawansARNAB: When your foreign policy is studied, observers analyze whats happening and whats not happening. If you give me the opportunity, I want to do a bit of analyses. There was a terrific pace of engagement with Pakistan between October, November and December. On 30th November, you met Nawaz Sharif on the sidelines (of UN Climate Summit in Paris). Both of you were seated on a sofa, talking to each other. A lot of people were speculating the contents of your conversation. This was on the sidelines of Climate Summit. After that, all of a sudden within seven days there were NSA level talks and Ajit Doval spoke to Nasir Janjua in Bangkok. And again after that you went to Russia via Afghanistan, you made an unexpected visit to Nawaz Sharif in Lahore. It was a personal trip but it still had some level of importance. Eight days later, Pakistani terrorists attacked Pathankot. Can you tell our viewers whether Pakistan was proactively responding in the months of October, November and December? Did the Pathankot terror attack change the situation? Is it true that Pakistan was making a lot of movement in those three months?PM MODI: Look there are different types of forces operating in Pakistan. But the government only engages with a democratically elected system. Our effort for that engagement is continuing. But our supreme objective is peace. Our supreme objective is to protect Indias interests. We keep making effort toward that objective and sometimes our efforts are successful. As far as meetings and talks are concerned, we signalled right from the day I took oath and sent invitations for the oath taking ceremony, that we seek friendly relations but without compromising on our interests. And that is why I have said that my countrys soldiers have full freedom to answer back in whatever manner they have to and they will keep doing thatARNAB: Mr Prime Minister what is the Lakshman Rekha that you would draw when it comes to Pakistan. There is some confusion surrounding this subject. I would like you to give an elaborate reply. In 2014, it was believed that if talks are being held, then they should be held between two countries and not with Hurriyat. It should be between the government of India and the government of Pakistan. The other Lakshman Rekha is that you must act on 26/11. Theres been no forward movement so far. The third thing is about forward movement on the Pathankot attack case. So what is the Lakshman Rekha now and if Pakistan remains within those bounds, so talks can happen at the political level or at any other level?PM MODI: The first thing is that with Pakistan, to whom do we talk to decide about the Lakshman Rekha. Will it be with the elected government or with other actors? That is why India will have to be on alert all the time. India will have to be alert every moment. There can never be any laxity in this. But there is an outcome due to my continuous efforts like my visit to Lahore and my invitation to the Pakistani Prime Minister to come to India. Now I dont have to explain to the world about Indias position. The world is unanimously appreciating Indias position. And the world is seeing that Pakistan is finding it difficult to respond. If we had become an obstacle, then we would have had to explain to the world that we are not that obstacle. Now we dont have to explain to the world. The world knows our intentions. Like on the issue of terrorism, the world never bought Indias theory on terrorism. They would sometime dismiss it by saying that its your law and order problem. Today the world has to accept what India has been saying about terrorism. Indias dialogue on terrorism, the losses India has suffered due to terrorism, the losses suffered by humanity, the world is now acknowledging that. So I believe we have to take this process forwardARNAB: Mr Prime Minister I now want to move to questions on the economy. In the past two years you have started many schemes. If we look at the theme of Jan Dhan Yojna for financial inclusion, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna for crop insurance, Swach Bharat, Skill India, Make In India. If we see the theme running through these schemes, is your social agenda at the core of your personal economic philosophy, social transformation? Is the social agenda at the core of your economic philosophy as the Prime Minister?PM MODI: The first point is our philosophy is to reach the last man in the line. Pandit Deendayal Upadhyays philosophy forms the core of our political, economic and social ideology. And even Mahatma Gandhi used to say that what is there for the last man? So my development parameter is very simple. It is about how the poorest of the poor can benefit from development. The poor is the central focus of my economic agenda. The poor should be strengthened in such a way that they get the willingness to defeat poverty. By helping the poor make ends meet while they remain in poverty is also one of the ways. I am not saying right or wrong but its one of the ways. But today the countrys situation is such that we should make the poor strong so that they become partners in defeating poverty. All these schemes are meant to empower the poor and change the quality of life. The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna is not only about opening bank accounts for the poor. Because of this the poor are feeling that they are becoming a part of the countrys economic system. The bank that he was seeing from afar, now he is able to enter that bank. This brings about a psychological transformation. Looked at in another way, did you ever imagine that 40 thousand crores could be injected into the banking system by contributions from the poor. The poor who never had bank accounts, have deposited 100 rupees, 50 rupees or 200 rupees. It means that poor man saved 100 rupees and the change began in his life. We have taken up construction of toilets. I had gone to Chhattisgarh and had the opportunity to get the blessings of one mother. An adivasi mother heard about the scheme for building toilets. She sold her four goats and built a toilet. That 90 old mother uses a walking stick and goes around the cluster of 30 or 40 houses in the tribal village and has been spreading the message to build toilets. This change is becoming the reason for the change in the quality of life. I have begun the cleanliness campaign. Its estimated an individual spends an average of 7000 rupees for treatment of a disease. The main reason for disease is filth. The poor suffer the most from the filth. If a poor man falls sick, he cannot drive his rickshaw for two days and his children go hungry. So how can we help the poor bring about change in their lives? Now there is a neo-middle class and a middle class in the country. The young have their aspirations. So another aspect of my policies you must have seen are the Start Up India, Stand Up India, Seaport activity, port activity, railways expansion, railway station upgradation. These changes directly appeal to the middle class. The middle class has its aspirations. We have to create jobs? How will job creation happen? Till I invest in the development of infrastructure, there be no job creation. You must have seen that the maximum electricity generation since Independence has occurred this year. The maximum amount of coal mined has been in this year. The maximum length of roads being constructed daily is happening in this year. The fastest loading and unloading of steamers at sea ports is happening now. All these changes are creating opportunities for employment like in Start up India, Stand Up India. For instance in Stand Up India, I have said that every bank should give an economic opportunity to one woman, one dalit or one tribal person to become entrepreneurs. This will create many job opportunities. So this is the basis of my economic philosophy.ARNAB: Mr Prime Minister if I could interrupt you on this. On the one hand is the peoples expectations and on the other is your vision. Many programs that you have mentioned, you cant put a calendar date to it but they dont have an immediate impact. They maybe able to show results in 3, 4, 5 maybe beyond 5 years. Now there are challenges in that. Mr Prime Minister, you are aware more than anyone else that people want immediate results. Now you spoke of job creation. The first thing, as an achievement you have managed to grow the economy at 7.5 per cent when the global economic climate is very bleak. You have spoken about it as well. You have met fiscal deficit targets, FDI inflows have increased but people are saying that job opportunities are not increasing. You have spoken about infrastructure but the current rate of unemployment. Mr Prime Minister, the latest Labour Bureau figures, is it a source of concern for you as the Prime Minister?PM MODI: The first thing is that are 800 million people below the age of 35 in our country. We have to accept that the demand for jobs is very high. But where will they get employment? Investment will come in. It will be used in the infrastructure sector, manufacturing and services sector. Now like the initiative we have taken, we have started the Mudra Yojna. More than three crore people in the country comprise washermen, barbers, milkman, newspaper vendors, cart vendors. We have given them nearly 1.25 lakh crore rupees without any guarantee. Now why have these people taken the money? To expand their work. When he expands his work, if he is currently employing one person, now he has to employ two people. If there were two employed earlier, now there are three. Now just think, when 3 crore of these small businesses have got access to finance, they must have expanded their work. Now all this is not in the Labour Departments registration. Three crore people have expanded their work. We took another small decision. The big malls in the country run 365 days a year but the smaller shops have to close on holidays. We announced in the Budget that even a small shopkeeper can operate his shop till late night and that too on all the seven days of the week. If the malls dont have restrictions then why should the small shopkeepers have restrictions. So now if a shopkeeper operates his shop till late and on all seven days, if he earlier employed one person, now he will have to employ two people. So wont the employment increase?ARNAB: So is your focus on entrepreneurship?PM MODI: Our focus is on all aspects. Now we are saying that by 2022 we want to ensure that everyone has a house. Housing sector has the maximum potential for creating employment. Houses will be built in such huge numbers, how many people will get employment? You must have seen that last year we brought in a textile policy. Under this textile policy, there will be income tax benefits for those who create employment. The more employment one creates, the more tax benefits they will get. For the first time, employment generation and tax has been linked. These are the things that boost employment and our central focus is creating employment for the ordinary citizenARNAB: Mr Prime Minister, questions are also being raised on food inflation which has still not decreased. The expectation was that the food inflation would decline. The people had put their hopes on the Prime Minister that you will bring down prices. This not only has a political impact but also has a social impact. Over the past two weeks, there were reports that in some places the price of Arhar dal had touched 150 rupees and 200 rupees for other pulses. The price of tomatoes was also rising. Is this only seasonal because the food inflation is increasing at 7.5 per cent year on year. Global oil prices have fallen. Do you think this creates perception issues for your government?PM MODI: You cant view inflation as a perception issue. Price rise should be seen as a reality. What is available for a consumer should be seen for what it is. There should never be an attempt to view price rise as a perception issue as a means of escaping the reality of price rise. We will have to accept reality. You see the fast pace at which prices were rising under the previous government, today that speed has decelerated a lot. You can see the statistics, you will find it there. Second, the country has gone through two consecutive years of severe drought. Drought has a direct impact on the price of vegetables, food and pulses because all these things are produced from the soil. Now when there is such a big drought, its not in anybodys hands. The second option in such a situation is imports. The Indian government has imported pulses in huge quantities. Third, it is the joint responsibility of the state and Central governments. It is not exclusively the states responsibility. It is not exclusively the Centres responsibility. It is the joint responsibility of both the state and Central governments. This should not be an issue of blame game that the state government did not do certain things and that the Centre did not do certain things. But it will have to be agreed that it is the joint responsibility of both. That is why the Centre has given rights to the states to make stringent laws. How much stocks to keep or not to keep are decisions which the states can take. All these rights have been given to the states. Some states have performed well, some states are trying. But the Centre and state governments are trying to work together on this. I believe that we have been successful to the extent that the speed with which prices were rising (under UPA), what would have happened if the prices were to rise at that speed. We have been successful in stopping that speedy rise of prices. But as far as pulses are concerned, production in India has been very low. Many farmers who were earlier sowing pulses have started cultivating sugar. That is also an area of concern. We gave special incentives for pulses. We have tried to set up a different MSP for pulses. We have taken steps to procure pulses from farmers with bonus. Our focus is on increasing the production of pulses. We are also focusing on building stocks of pulses by importing from abroad. An all out effort is being made and I believe that nobody doubts the sincerity of this governmentARNAB: Mr Prime Minister what is your view about the controversy around the exit of Raghuram Rajan as the RBI Governor? A lot has been spoken about this. There was commentary that it may effect Indias image, perception as a global economy. Whats your own view of the controversy around the exit of Raghuram Rajan?PM MODI: When my Government was formed in May 2014, you take newspapers from May, June, July 2014 and check television debates during that period. The topic of the television debates would be  Will the new govt let Raghuram Rajan continue? Or Will the new Government oust Raghuram Rajan? And there was more or less consensus that he was appointed by the previous govt and so Modi wont let him complete his tenure and will remove him. You have seen, that he worked his entire tenure. For the time he was appointed by the previous government, he completing his entire term. So all the misconceptions have been dispelled. Secondly, according to my 2 year experience in Govt, those who are creating controversies, are being unjust to Raghuram RajanARNAB: Why so?PM MODI: I will tell you. Those who sayI believe Raghuram Rajans patriotism is no less than any of ours. It will be doing injustice to him if one says that he will serve the country only if he is at a particular post. As much as I know Raghuram Rajan, whatever post he holds, wherever he is, he is someone who will continue to serve the country. He is someone who loves his country. Therefore, its not like the nation wont get Raghuram Rajans services, Raghuram Rajan is not that kind of a person. He is a person who loves the country. Those who speak such language are doing great injustice to him. My experience with him has been good.I appreciate the work he has done. And my good wishes will always be with himARNAB: Prime Minister Modi, theres a question related to this. During your speech at the Executive you used seven words begining with letter S Sevabhaav (service), Santulan (balance), Sanyam (restraint), Samvaad (dialogue), Samanvay (coordination), Sakaratmak (positivity) and Samvedna (sensitivity). I will ask the question in context with Raghuram Rajan because you used these words in the speech at National Executive Meet speech on June 14 in Allahabad. You said, Our party leaders and party workers should use these qualities in their daily dealings and behaviour. Prime Minister, in Raghuram Rajans context, your Rajya Sabha MP has made many comments. Later he made critical remarks against senior bureaucrats. My question is, do you think it is right? When we talk about Sanyam (restraint) and Santulan (balance), is it correct?PM MODI: Whether it is someone from my party or not, I believe that such things are inappropriate. The nation wont benefit from such publicity stunts. One should be more responsible while conducting themselves. Anyone who believes he is bigger than the system is wrong.ARNAB: Thats a very clear message.PM MODI: I have a very clear message. I have no two minds about it.ARNAB: And Mr Prime Minister, if I may say so, between May 8 and now, you are speaking as straight as you did before you took over as Prime Minister. I think that answer takes me to the next subject. Mr Prime Minister, the issue is that of Black Money. In a very interersting way you said, prices should not be looked at from the point of percepetion, equally, Mr Prime Minister it can be said said that an issue like Black Money should not be looked at in terms of perception, but it is perception forming. There are political debates on this. Experts say that the Black Money economy has shrunk, 10-15% economy has shrunk through land dealings and other things. You have passed the Black Money Bill, you have made taxation more transparent, you have started information sharing with other countries, you have taken steps, but Prime Minister Modi, people still expect that a Rs 25 lakh crores will be brought back and put into their bank accounts. How will you address that expectation? The hope that people have taking Black Money, how will you address it?PM MODI: How did the black money issue arise and how did it become such a serious issue? We have to look at the background. It is an established fact in the minds of the common man those who steal money park their money overseas. Its a common perception. Even if I look at it from the common mans perspective, I also wonder where does this money go? This issue was always stalled in the Parliament. When the matter reached the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court ordered Special Investigation Team to look into it, even then the previous government stalled it for three years, from 2011-2014. Its after this that political parties, the media and the common man started believing that theres something wrong. Then the issue of Black Money became an agenda. Even today I can saythat yes, when there is money stashed in foreign accounts, there are some norms of engagement with foreign countries on the issue. But between 2011-2014, these people were given the opportunity to launder money here and thereARNAB: And you also said on 17 February 2015 on this issue, that the then Law Minister is only offering lip servicePM MODI: The result was that people got several chances to launder money. Secondly, after our Government was formed, the first decision taken by our Cabinet was to form a Special Investigation Team to bring back Black Money which was pending despite Supreme Courts 2011 order. This shows our sincerity. From then on, you cant imagine how stringent the laws have been made to bring back Black Money and whoever comes in its fold will know how strict the law is. Thirdly, I attended the G20 Summit. Never was Black Money issue discussed in the G20 forum. It was my first G20 summit, for the first time I met the world leaders. And for the first time in the G20 Summit, one paragraph was on unaccounted money, on black money and 20 countries said that the world should cooperateBlack. The dirty money, black money was also linked to terrorism, an environment of global census was created. We have been signing agreements one after the other with different countries that there will be real time, automatic exchange of information with India. I recently visited Switzerland and there was minimal discussion on the issue. But after I returned, a big delegation from Switzerland visited India, and they held meeting with the Indian Government and we discussedfor several years, we believed that Switzerland is the place where black money is stashed, that country is holding discussions to come to a consensus on Automatic Information Exchange and if we reach consensus it will be a great achievement. Thirdly you mustve seen that Mauritius route came up in almost everything. It was said that money goes out of India and returns through the Mauritius route. This was discussed. Everyone thought that nothing can be done about the Mauritius route.But our Government held a dialogue with the Mauritius Government, made changes to the old treaty. And we successfully made a new treaty to block the money which comes through the Mauritius route and very soon it will be phased out and completed. All these decisions are taken to fight the Black Money menace. This is not a one sided fight. Secondly, the govt is working in a direction to make sure that Black Money isnt generated in India and black Money doesnt go out of India, you can see the results of all this.ARNAB: When the opposition raises the Rs 15 lakh issue.PM MODI: That is something the opposition raises during elections. Let them have some issue to talk aboutARNAB: Mr Prime Minister, there has been no major financial corruption or scam in your tenure in the last two years. Perception is again, what people say is because you keep a very tight control on the reins of Government but the question is there are people, who are wilful defaulters, the economic offenders who take a lot of money from the country or commit economic offences in the country, go overseas and use rules and use lawyers, and they dont come back to India. And people are asking now, is the Narendra Modi Govt determined to take these cases of wilful defaulters and economic offenders to their logical conclusion.PM MODI: Firstly, this question is not in the minds of people. The people of India have confidence that if theres someone who can do this, it is Narendra Modi and he will do it. Citizens of the country have full faith.ARNAB: Does it worry you, that people have misued the law?PM MODI: I take this as an opportunity and I will show them what the law is.ARNAB: Mr. Modi, there have been several corruption cases about the previous government, which have now come out. There is AgustaWestland, many defense scams and defense transactions are now being analyzed seriously. The cases which were quoted in the CAG reports but were ignored are now coming in the forefront. This question is important because this isnt just about financial corruption but these questions have direct implications on the national security of the country. Do you think, when they say that this is a political witch hunt by Narendra Modi Sarkar, do you think all of these cases would have been possible without political patronage?PM MODI: There are many things which are not visible. One cant imagine the difficulty I am experiencing in taking out things from dirt. One who is working there knows the amount of dirt that exists and how certain things have been caught in a web. There are certain powers behind it. The case about Agusta helicopters. I cant deny it and I believe that we have the right to doubt that people behind this are very experienced. They have perfectly practiced the art of doing wrong deeds. They are very experienced and knowledgeable. And one can also smell the fact that such a thing wouldnt have been done without a shield. Now, agencies are probing. Lets see how far the probe goes. But the investigation shouldnt go ahead while people are being targeted, neither does my government target anyone. The sin has been committed, but how much is done, How was it done, who did it, probe agencies will find out in a professional way. Whatever comes out, will be put outARNAB: Prime Minister, talking about your speech in the US Congress, and the humour that you displayed. I felt some of it was impromptu. But the Americans were able to relate to what you said, I dont remember the exact words, you said, I am informed that the working of the US Congress is harmonious. And then there was a pause and people were laughing. Then you said, I am told  You emphasized and said I am told that you are well known for your bipartisanship. Then the applause was more. And then you said, You are not alone. Time and again I have witnessed a similar spirit in the Indian Parliament. You spoke about a serious topic in a interesting manner. You referred to the Upper House. There was a lot of response on that too. Your humour was really appreciated and I think it was a wonderful moment when you were speaking. But, Mr. Prime Minister, when you look back at the parliament, this question comes to many peoples minds, has Prime Minister Narendra Modi being held back from achieving his own objectives because of the non-stop parliamentary logjam. How much has this affected his moving towards his own targets? If you critically analyze this situation, do you feel your government could have been more consultative or do you feel the blame is entirely with the Opposition?PM MODI: I look at it differently. I believe there have been a lot of problems. Whether the fault is ours or theirs, I ll leave it to the people. People will decide. But because of discussions in Parliament  we may not come to a decision, the decision could be opposing our view, nothing wrong in that. But at least there should be a discussion. The sad part is, if somebody is running away from debate or dont let discussions happen, then it is a cause of worry in a democracy. Whether the governments work is accomplished or not, I dont see it as a cause of worry. If not today, it will happen tomorrow. There are certain things which will happen at an administrative level. The big thing is, Parliament is for discussion. Parliament is to show dissent. Parliament is to give an argument for ones opposition, to present an argument when they support.To uphold this basic spirit of Parliament, is the responsibility of every person who values democracy. It is the responsibility of those present in the Parliament and those outside. It is the responsibility of those in power and those not in power. This is a matter of spirit and it should be followed. As far as the government is concerned, on every issue and at every forum, we have tried to hold discussions. I myself have met the opposition leaders and spoken to them. Key members of the government are also in touch. And you must have seen that many issues have been resolved. In the last session, we have passed 12 bills in Rajya Sabha, we passed 10 bills in the Lok Sabha. So the pace has picked up. When people say Opposition, it is unfair to the opposition. There are some parties in the Parliament which are not with the BJP or NDA, but are with the government on key decisions. So, to defame the Opposition by saying that all opposition parties are against us  when some people do this, it is wrong. There is one party which has problems. And the whole world knows that party. Secondly, to say that When you were is Opposition, you did it this way There is a difference between every Opposition party. We have run the government for 60 years and now we are in the Opposition, so we know the nitty-gritties of the government, we know the responsibilities. We cant behave in the way, a new Opposition party behaves. A party which hasnt been in power or hasnt seen anything, could behave in this way. For example, we are in power now, and consider in 2040 we become the Opposition party. So, in 2040 we cant have the same conduct as the one we had in 2009 or 2010.ARNAB: Congress is a very experienced and old partyPM MODI: Thats why I say that, those who have been in power for so many years, shouldnt be doing this. If there is a new party in the Opposition, they have a small demand for their state or if an MP has a demand for his/her constituency and does something like this, then we can understand. Ones who have been in power for very long, shouldnt be doing such thingsARNAB: Prime Minister Modi, do you think the GST bill which has been stuck for over one and half years, it is a path-breaking economic reform. It unifies the country. Recently you met Ms Jayalalithaa after she was sworn in as the Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee has extended her support for GST and Congress allies at the state level are supporting the GST bill. Do you feel optimistic that GST bill will be passed in the next session of the Parliament?PM MODI: First we need to understand, that we look at GST only within the purview of an economic reform because of which the right information doesnt come out. Not having GST straight away means loss for the poor of Uttar Pradesh. Absence of GST straight away means loss for the poor people of Bihar. Not passing the GST would mean loss for the poor people of poor states like Bengal, Orissa and Assam. People who sit in the Rajya Sabha must understand this. GST is beneficial for the poor people of the states represented by them, because those states will economically benefit the most from GST. The money will be used for the welfare of the poor people of those states. This is why be it Mamata Banerjee, be it Nitish Kumar, be it Akhilesh Yadav or Naveen Patnaik, all these states want the GST bill to be passed at the earliest. There is just one group which has made it the issue of prestige. Now the kind of arithmetic which is working out, I hope that this decision is passed in favour of the poor. You will be surprised to what extent has the opposition reached to the level of distortion. In the previous session we introduced an act. Indian government has Rs 40,000 crore rupees from the CAMPA Fund. Rs 40,000 crore. we wanted to give that money to the states. States have to use that money for forestry, for greenery, for planting trees and plants. The bill is meant for that. Had this Rs 40,000 crore reached the states before the monsoons, it would have been used for the forests. A lot of people would have got employment, people who plant trees would have been employed. There would be plantation and due to the rains the plants would start growing within a year. But just because of obstructionism, states have been deprived of the benefit of Rs 40,000 crore. The money was meant for the forests and for the tribals. They blocked it. There was no argument on itARNAB: The reasonyou had triedPM MODI: Made all efforts.ARNAB: You had invited former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi here at the Race Course RoadPM MODI: We held talks at every levelARNAB: Still? The word you used ego issue, why has it become an ego issue? And people would want to know why is the Prime Minister unable to end this?PM MODI: The Prime Minister cannot answer this question. Those creating obstructions can only answer this question. But despite this, I will keep trying. I am ready to convince them in which ever way possible. If I have to convoke someone over a cup of tea at their house, I am even ready for that. I have no problem. My only aim is the welfare of the poor of my country and the poor of states like Uttar Pradesh.ARNAB: You spoke of Uttar Pradesh. Mr Prime Minister, elections will be held in Uttar Pradesh in 6,7,8 months. The focus of entire nation will be on it. You are the MP from Varanasi. But some comments are made by BJP, some say Sangh Parivar, some independent groups, communal colour is added to it and not just from one party but from other parties as well. Mr Prime Minister are you going to be able to keep development as the sole agenda? The main issue in the Uttar Pradesh polls should be that of development, it shouldnt get capsized, the focus shouldnt be elsewhere. Are you confident that communal agenda will not overpower development?PM MODI: Its my conviction, its my commitment. You must have seen during the 2014 elections that I fought elections on the issue of development. The new generation of the country only believes in development. I believe that solution to all problems is in development. Development is also the solution to the tension that people talk about. If we provide employment to people, if we ensure theres food on their plates, if we provide them with facilities and give them education, all the tension will end. And this is why, all those who want good for the nation, I request them to compete towards development and for development. This atmosphere should be created in the country and I think such an environment is being created nowadays.ARNAB: So the hot heads who make extreme comments, is there a necessity to control them? So that there is no politics in the name of religionPM MODI: Firstly, I am of the firm belief that the nation should progress on the issue of development. And it is necessary that the country moves forward on the issue of development. I would like to tell the media not to make heroes out of those people who make such comments.ARNAB: But they keep making such commentsPM MODI: Dont make them heroes, they will stopARNAB: We dont make them heroes, we make them villains.PM MODI: But why do you make them so big? I see such statements by people on TV, whose faces I havent even seen and they end up becoming spokesmen on TVARNAB: Self styled spokesmenPM MODI: I dont know why such people are encouragedARNAB: Mr Prime Minister, lets talk in 2016 of the 2017 elections. After Delhi, then Bihar, then Assam, West Bengal. After that we will talk about Punjab. Before we finish talking about Punjab, we will talk about Uttar Pradesh. Then there is the Gujarat state election. Dont you think that this country is permanently stuck in an electoral cycle? The focus constantly and I want you to reflect on this issue, the focus is on party politics, polarising issues, not on governance. We are a country, if we say, we are constantly in a political campaign mode. Is this a good thing? Should we break away from it? And what is your view on it?PM MODI: See this is not an issue about Narendra Modi or the Prime Minister. And also it is not an issue about a particular party or a particular Government.But before the last Parliament session, the Speaker had called all the parties for a meal. After the agenda meeting everyone was sitting to eat. I had also reached at the same time. While talking casually over food, almost people from all parties said that the central and state elections must be held together. Everyone said it. After that during the farewell function of the Rajya Sabha MPs, people from different parties were talking with each other. One of the leaders said, Modiji do anything but get us out of this cycle of elections.ARNAB: Was that leader from your party?PM MODI: No, he was not from my party. So I said that discussion should happen. What is wrong in that? Then one day I said that this was being talked about. This issue has also been discussed in a Parliamentary committee. This work has also been started by the Election Commission and I think they have also writen a letter on it. Like in the fight against black money, this issue of elections also gets connected to black money. Electoral reforms are necessary if the country has to be rid of black money. It is one of the areas for electoral reforms. I believe that the Prime Minister cannot take a decision on this and nor should he do that. Neither the government can do this.There should be a broad discussion on this and we should not run away from the debate on this continious cycle of elections. The Indian voter today is very mature. He votes in one fashion in the Lok Sabha elections, he votes in a different manner in the State Assembly elections. We have seen this. In 2014, the General Elections conincided with the Odisha Assembly elections. The same electorate gave one judgement for Odisha and another judgement for Delhi. So this countrys voter is very mature and we should trust his maturity. There should be a debate on how costs can be reduced by holding simultaneous elections, how the influence of black money can be curbed, how the five years can be spent in taking the country forward. Today due to the model code of conduct, there is a loss even in those areas where the code is not applicable.When I was in Gujarat, I found that at least 80 to 90 officers were spending two to three months on election duties in other states. This could be happening in every state. So this is an area of concern and some time or the other this question will have to be thought of. I would want the Election Commission to take this debate forward. They should invite all political parties and hold discussions with everybody and whatever comes out of it.ARNAB: Can there be a timebound resolution in this?PM MODI: The Election Commission will have to invite all political parties to discuss this. The process will get derailed if one party were to initiate this.ARNAB: Are you willing to take the lead in building that consensus?PM MODI: Despite being the Prime Minister, I still belong to a political party. The better thing would be for the Election Commission to initiate this. Today the Election Commission is a very prestigious institution in our country. Every political party believes in the Election Commission and it will further empower this institution and that will be better.ARNAB: I think it is an interesting idea of simultaneous elections. Though state parties, regional parties may feel that it will effect them badly. That the national parties like the BJP will gain.PM MODI: Odisha is the best example. Odisha is the best example. In 2014, the BJP had no advantage in the state but the BJP won on the Lok Sabha seats. This shows the difference.ARNAB: Mr Prime Minister how are you keeping your schedule nowadays? I mean you keep a terrifying pace. The number of meetings you hold, people say your officers find it hard to keep up.PM MODI: It is not so, it has been 2 years now and everyone is used to the work. I believe that it is such a big country that one must do as much work as possible. So I keep doing that.ARNAB: Before I come to my last question Mr Prime Minister, one issue that I want to come to is the farmers crisis. As you are well aware, there has been a crisis in this country, you referred to it. In that speech to your MPs, about which I asked you earlier as well, on 20th May in the Central Hall of Parliament you said that this government is not for myself, this government is for the poor, we must do something for them. The farmers crisis Mr Prime Minster is a reality. I am glad that in this interview you have not avoided the reality, youve faced it, youve talked about it. We have linked our entire future to the monsoons. How do we overcome this from becoming an annual crisis in this country?PM MODI: We will have to put stress on water management here. You must have seen that under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayi Yojana, we have put stress on water issues. During these drought days, I met leaders from 11 states separately and sat with them for about 2-3 hours each. The country would have believed that their Prime Minister is working even if I had held a meeting with 11 of them together for around 10 minutes. But I didnt do that. I sat with leaders from different states separately to understand specific problems and what we could do for water in those states. I am happy, whichever party the state government affiliated to, all the governments focused a lot on water issues this summer.We will reap its benefits this monsoon. Using scientific methods for water accumulation and irrigation, collecting water and directing them towards the fields, everyone did that. Micro irrigation is stressed upon. Even for sugarcane farming, farmers are slowly moving towards micro irrigation which earlier happened through flood irrigation. Paddy crops for which large amount of water is used. Today, farmers have started using drip irrigation for it. If we do well in water facilities, then one of the problems is solved. After independence, for the first time, we have brought in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana which can cover maximum number of farmers. The farmer will have to pay only 2%, only 2%, the government will take care of the rest. The farmers will get an assurance. For instance, in Maharashtra, the monsoons are expected in the month of June, the farmers have prepared for everything but havent started with the sowing process. Now if there are no rains till August, so practically his crops have not been damaged, because he did not sow the seeds.But the Pradhan Mantri fasal Beema Yojana even takes this into consideration and benefits the farmer. Another important aspect, once the crops are harvested, theyre cut and kept in the field, assuming it has been a good year for crop growth, with 100% crop production, but it hasnt been loaded on trucks and sent to the market yet. And if it rains, even after 15 days of harvesting, if there is loss, it is covered under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana. Second layer of protection, minimum premium with maximum cover. After independence, for the first time, we have brought in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana. Thirdly, first time we have brought in E-Mandi concept. Farmer in the village, can sell the crops to the best markets in the country through his mobile phone. Farmer would set the price at which the crop would be sold. Earlier, farmers used to take the produce on carts or tractors, used to go to a mandi 20-25kms away, then due to storage issues, even if they had to sell for Rs 10 less than the price, they used to sell it. Now, sitting at home the farmer would know what price to sell the crops at. Next point is about, food processing, value addition. We opened up 100% foreign direct investment in food processing.For example, if a farmer is selling tomatoes and if a company is processing tomato ketchup then my farmers would benefit from it. The companies that make aerated drinks, Coca-Cola, Pepsi etc, I requested them to add 5% natural fruit juice. In regions near Nagpur and Vidarbha where oranges are cultivated, Coca-Cola is going to add 5% of orange juice. If we add 5% natural juice to aerated water, farmers would get their market and their fruits wouldnt go waste. We should have a comprehensive all-out scheme. So much of our land has been damaged. We have brought in Soil Health Card. We have a Soil Health Abhiyan. The farmer will know the fertility of the land through it. Whether a fertilizer needs to be used or not, the farmer will understand. On an average, a farmer with 1 hectare of land will be able to save Rs 15000-20000. So we have brought in scientific methods. You would know that in our country, farmers used to be lathicharged when they would go to buy urea and they had to buy it in black. We got urea 100% neem coated. Earlier, urea used to go to chemical factories, and the government subsidies were stolen in the name of farmers. After neem coating, urea cannot be used for any other purpose except farming.Because of neem coating, there is a qualitative change which helps in healing the damaged land. Due to neem coating a piece of land that used 10 kgs of urea can now manage with 7 kgs of urea. All these initiatives are in the direction of agriculture and the resuARNAB: Do you think that the farmers crisis will be resolved, the question I asked, that it wont be an annual affair, the dependence on monsoons will go down?PM MODI: See agriculture is a state subject. The Indian government has taken initiatives, if the state government are enthusiastic to implement this, which I think they will be. As I told you I met leaders from different states and they worked a lot for water issues. If this works, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana has direct involvement of the central government, it will have great benefits.ARNAB: Mr Prime Minister now I have two questions for you.PM MODI: This has become too long.ARNAB: Ill club these two (questions) together. Youre also enjoying it and I am glad youre speaking Mr Prime Minister because there is so much ground to cover and I think viewers would like to hear your view, sir. Actually there are three, if you allow me. Theyre short questions. First is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, how much is politics playing on your mind? In the sense that every Prime Minister, especially someone who is as forthright as you, looks at the next big challenge. Is 2019 anywhere in your mind?PM MODI: Those who have seen me in Gujarat, and those who have seen me in the last two years, those who see me without any bias, they will know that I am an apolitical Prime Minister. Apart from elections, I dont get involved into politics ever. You can call elections a necessity, a restraint or a responsibility, we have to do it. I attend many functions, go to different areas, you wouldnt have heard any political comment from me. If I go to a government function, I talk about government related topics. If I attend a Railways function I talk about railways, if water then water, if water bodies, then water bodies. My focus is on governance. Country has been at greatest loss because governments were run only for elections. Governments must not run only for elections. The government should be a bona fide attempt of meeting the demands and expectations of the common people. Elections should just be a bi-product. It is a democracy. Winning and losing is a part of it. It shouldnt be hyped. You would have seen recently I urged everyone to pay taxes before 30th September. I even said it on Mann Ki Baat yesterday. Will a person, who is only concerned with winning elections, say that post 30th September youd face problems?ARNAB: This was also a warning in a way.PM MODI: It is a warning. It is definitely a warning. It is a warning. My first warning is to my government officers to not presume citizens as thieves. I have already given this warning. I have handled my officers first. It took me quite some time. You will be shocked to hear that I have given an early retirement to more than 30 people from Income Tax Department on integrity issues. This isnt a small issue. People who werent transferred since 20 years, I got them transferred. So, one, my focus is on my system. Second, I also tell the country, that for the poor of the nation we would have to give out something for the poor in our country. It is my responsibility to give the people an account of every rupee. I will use it at right places. I wont let it get stolen. But if I need to give houses to the poor, we would need revenue. I dont want to increase taxes, I just want taxes to be paid honestly. There is no need to increase the taxes. The country can run without troubling the citizens. I am working towards it. That is why I have given the citizens a chance to pay the taxes till 30th September, whatever it is Rs 10,000 or Rs. 50,000. If they think they want to come into mainstream, they must and shouldnt be worried. After 30th September, the government will have to take steps. I will not worry about the polls. I will take the necessary steps. I want to work for the poor in my country.ARNAB: Mister Prime Minister, do some crystal ball gazing for the next three years. For the next three years, to use the cricketing analogy, how do you find your run rate so far and will you have to score at a higher run rate in the next three years to achieve your targets?PM MODI: See, no matte at what speed I move forward, I am never satisfied. If today I run at a speed of 100, I keep an aim of running at 200. I think that the world that was behind us, has gone ahead. We need to run a lot to match that level. So we do not need to calculate. We just need to give it all in. And I have given myself in completely. Ive been successful is pulling my entire government in. I believe that the country is also committed to move forwardARNAB: Final question to you Mr Prime Minister, what motivates you the most? First of all as I said, will you be able to keep this pace? What motivates you the most and also if you can share with our viewers honestly what is your one greatest source of worry?PM MODI: Firstly, I dont live under the burden of worries. Problems and challenges are there, you cant deny that. But you must challenge the challenges and not let the challenges turn into worries. This is my principle. I challenge the challenges. I like to face the problems. I dont run away from them. Whatever loss I have to face for it, I face it. But I cant leave the country helpless. This responsibility must be taken and I will continue to do so. For all good and bad things, it is my responsibility. I do not regret anything. I believe, people of the country have given me the responsibility and I must fulfill it. Thirdly, when I see the poor in our country, it reminds me of the work that I have to do for them. Day before yesterday, I was in Pune, and met a Shrimaan Chandrakant ji. A retired teacher with a pension of Rs 16000, donates Rs 5000 every month for Swachh Abhiyaan. If a 70 year old retired teacher with children and family at home, without worrying about them, worries about the country, then being the Prime Minister, I should work a thousand times more than Chandrakant ji. This is my inspiration. People of this country who work day and night, they are my inspiration. I look at them and I work even harder.ARNAB: Prime Minister Narendra Modi it has been a privilege. I am grateful for this interview.PM MODI: Thank youARNAB: And thank you on behalf of all our viewers that you spoke frankly. The program is Frankly Speaking and I am thankful to you that you were so frank.PM MODI: I just request you to not create controversies out of this but instead use it for the benefit of the country.ARNAB: Please do not think like that. Thank you very muchPM MODI: Thanks a lot. Thank you very much.ARNAB: Thank you very much.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"
593cc5997be9e00e964d3919,Technology and business: When a global Swiss agribusiness giant becomes Chinese-owned,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/chemchia-syngenta-swiss-agribusiness-becomes-china-owned-2762969/,2016-04-21,,Indian Express,"On February 3, Syngenta said that it was being bought by China National Chemical Corporation for over $43 billion in cash. The announcement sent shockwaves as the Swiss agri-science major had, only last August, spurned an acquisition offer from the US life sciences giant, Monsanto. The move, had it gone through, would have merged the worlds biggest agrochemical/crop protection company (Syngenta) with the global leader in seeds and genomics (Monsanto). Meanwhile, on December 3, DuPont and Dow Chemical, also with interests in both crop protection as well as seeds, decided to undertake what they called a merger of equals.In such an environment of consolidation involving Western ag-science giants  driven by the global commodity downturn impacting demand  a Swiss MNC becoming a 100 per cent subsidiary of a Chinese state-owned enterprise naturally surprised many.Syngentas global CEO, John Ramsay is, however, clear why his company chose ChemChina over Monsanto. A Monsanto-Syngenta deal resulting in the creation of a single entity with a dominant global position in both hybrid seeds and agrochemicals, he believes, is most likely to have encountered regulatory hurdles across jurisdictions.Read | Farm policy: A game-changing acquisition that India should learn fromOne thing people havent really taken into account is the fact that there has been no major consolidation in thisindustry since 2002. The anti-trust regulators, thus, have not had a big deal to look at for some time now, says Ramsay, in an interview he gave to The Indian Express while on a visit to India last week.The last big merger the ag-science industry saw, he notes, happened in 2002 when Bayer acquired Aventis CropScience to form Bayer CropScience (which is the world No. 2 in crop protection behind Syngenta). Even Syngenta was the product of a merger, in 2000, of the agribusiness divisions of Novartis and AstraZeneca.But that does not still explain, why ChemChina? Ramsays answer to it is that Syngentas existing shareholders  basically asset management firms and hedge funds  are the kinds who want consistent returns in an industry prone to crop cycles. The level of financial returns they expect year after year, according to him, is not in the companys long-term interest, which lies in investing in research & development even during periods of commodity downturns and currency volatility such as the present one.In 2015, Syngentas R&D investment at $1.36 billion was marginally below the $1.43 billion for the previous year, even as the drop in sales was sharp from $15.13 billion to $13.41 billion. This is an industry that, despite the crop cycles, clearly has an excellent future because of the needs of the world in terms of food security and the continuity in demand for agricultural produce globally. What we have in ChemChina is a new shareholder, which understands the cycles. It knows that the winners here are those who will continue to invest in technology through the cycles. This is different from the traditional western fund management mentality of seeking consistent returns, Ramsay points out.For the Chinese authorities, the investment in Syngenta is also of great strategic value, given their high anxiety about food security. For a country with 22 per cent of the worlds population and only 7 per cent of its arable land, it is no wonder that every time they produce a new five-year plan, youll find food security is right on their radar.Read | Monsanto patent under cloud as Bt cotton prone to pink bollwormThe Syngenta buy will give ChemChina access to all its ag-science know-how and patents. Ramsay claims that there would be no fundamental change to the Basel-based company, except that we will be enhancing our Chinese resources to bring technology to China in a more aspirational way, perhaps, than we had done previously. ChemChinas own agrochemicals portfolio is not really of relevance to us. The companys relevance will be only as a shareholder and even there, it wouldnt be an industry participator in the way that Monsanto would have been.Crop protection generated $10 billion of Syngentas global sales of $13.41 billion in 2015, with seeds contributing $2.84 billion. The companys revenues in India amounted to Rs 2,904.75 crore for FY15, with an estimated 60 per cent coming from crop protection and the balance 40 per cent from seeds.Syngenta has the second largest share (after Bayer CropScience) of Indias roughly Rs 14,000 crore agrochem market, which also has other majors like DuPont, Rallis India, UPL Ltd, PI Industries, BASF and Dhanuka Agritech. It also claims to be No. 1 in hybrid sunflower and vegetable seeds  especially of tomatoes, cauliflower, sweet and hot pepper, sweet corn, radish and watermelon  apart from having No. 3 position in corn (behind DuPont Pioneer and Monsanto) and rice (behind Bayer CropScience and DuPont Pioneer).How MNCs have taken over Indias agrochem marketWhile much of the public focus when it comes to farm inputs is riveted on fertiliser and seeds  more so with the brouhaha over Monsantos Bt cotton technology  agrochemicals largely escape attention. The dominance of multinationals in this segment is far more than even in seeds, where there is still a reasonably strong presence ofIndian breeders, both in the public as well as private sectors.Whether it is DuPonts Rynaxypry (Coragen and Ferterra brands), Bayer CropSciences Flubendiamide (Fame) or Syngentas Thiamethoxam (Virtako), these and many such other insecticide products of MNCs, incorporating proprietary new chemistry, have captured a significant share of Indias crop protection chemicals market.The main characteristic of the new generation molecules with novel modes of action for controlling target pests  apart from their being mostly patented  is their low levels of spraying.Read | Monsanto threatens to exit India over govts show cause noticeTo understand this, take Isoproturon, which is used for control of phalaris minor grass weeds (gulli danda) in wheat. Farmers typically had to apply about 500 grams per acre of this herbicide that was originally introduced in the 1970s. But with Sulfosulfuron, which Monsanto launched under the Leader brand in the 1990s, this fell to barely 10 grams per acre.Similarly, Bayer CropSciences Imidacloprid and Syngentas Thiamethoxam seed treatment insecticides  both based on a family of compounds called neonicotinoids  require just 40 milliliters per acre of application in cotton and rice, which used to earlier be 250-400 ml with Monocrotophos, an old generation organophosphate molecule.The new crop protection products have less toxic effect on the environment, humans, flora and fauna. Also, they are less hazardous, being mainly water-soluble concentrate formulations. The earlier formulations were emulsifiable concentrates using petroleum-based solvents, says Sarjiwan Singh Manhas, Syngentas South Asia R&D head. But introduction of new products based on proprietary chemistry is only one part. Equally important is the aggressive way in which the MNCs are pushing these among farmers.Syngenta, for example, has sought to popularise Gromore, which is supposedly an integrated crop protection solution for paddy covering all its four key growth phases.Thus, for the seedling phase, which is up to 30 days from the date of transplanting, the company is promoting Rifit, a herbicide mainly targeted at the Echinochloa species of weeds, and Virtako for control of early-stage rice stem borer insect pest. For the vegetative stage lasting from 31 to 60 days, it is similarly offering Amistar Top against sheath blight fungus and Virtako for both stem borer and leaf folder insects. Then, there is Chess for brown plant hopper and Tilt, a broad-spectrum fungicide, to be both applied during the reproductive phase between 61 to 90 days.By selling a range of its own branded pesticide products for all stages of the crop under a unified Gromore protocols solution, Syngenta has vastly increased its business among paddy growers in India. The cost of implementing Gromore protocols ranges between Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,500 per acre, depending on whether the farmer opts for the light (4-5 sprays in all) or full (7-8 sprays) solution. This is more than the normal Rs 1,500-2,000 per acre that paddy growers spend on crop protection.By following our protocols, the farmer harvests 4-5 quintals more paddy per acre. At Rs 1,400 per quintal, this translates into an additional income of Rs 6,000, as against the Rs 1,000-1,500 extra he may spend, claims Manhas. That may be some value proposition for the farmer and, of course, the company.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Other than tomatoes, prices of almost all vegetables have seen a rise of 15-20 per cent.High input costs and the ongoing drought conditions have resulted in all-time high prices of broiler birds across the state. The farmgate prices of a 2-2.5 kg bird has now crossed the Rs 104 mark, making it an all-time high for the industry.Vasantkumar Shetty, conveyor, All India Broiler Co-ordination Committee, said over the past few days, prices of broiler has been on the higher side due to dip in supply. However, input costs, especially maize, has also seen a sharp rise, making it difficult for the farmers to make ends meet. Average rate of a bird weighing between 2 and 2.5kg in Pune in May was Rs 83.25, while in June it has already crossed Rs 99.33. With rains getting delayed, prices are expected to rise further in the days to come.Watch Video: Whats making newsBoth maize and soyameal which form the bulk of the poultry feed has been on the dip with domestic and international prices on the higher side. Prices will come only after a couple of showers. Maize being a 90-day crop once the rains come both farmers and traders will offload their produce, he said.

Prices of tomato has crossed the Rs 80 per kg mark in retail market with traders saying it will cross Rs 100 per kg if rains fail to come on time. Shriram Gadve, president of the vegetable growers association of India (VGAI), said the vegetable growing areas in Pune, Ahmednagar, Dhule, Satara, Sangli have reported huge reduction in area due to water paucity. Vegetables are cultivated in around 2 lakh hectare area in the state.Pune market on Tuesday saw arrival of around 501 quintal of tomatoes with the highest price being paid for a quintal being Rs 5,500.

(Express photo by Praveen Khanna) All efforts are on to nab the other accused, said Bageshwar SP, Sukhbeer Singh, even as district officials and police officers spent most of Monday preparing for CM Harish Rawats visit. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna)Twenty kg of rice, 10 kg of wheat and 2 kg of pulses. Sugar, oil, potatoes, tomatoes and onions, and candles. A visit by Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat (on Tuesday) and announcement of Rs 10 lakh in compensation. That was an official at the office of the District Magistrate in Bageshwar, listing what Sohan Rams family  his father, wife and two children  is getting as compensation.On October 5, Dalit labourer Ram was killed, allegedly by a government school teacher from the upper-caste Thakur community, who hurled casteist slurs before cutting his throat with a sickle, for entering and defiling a flour mill in Kadaria village.The accused, Lalit Karnatak, was arrested the next day but his brother and father, who have been accused of threatening Rams family against filing a complaint, are absconding. It took two more days for the promised rations to reach Rams family, after the case was reported by local media. But on Monday, with the brutal killing triggering protests in Dehradun and Bageshwar, and the assembly elections scheduled next year, the state government has sprung into action.All efforts are on to nab the other accused, said Bageshwar SP, Sukhbeer Singh, even as district officials and police officers spent most of Monday preparing for Rawats visit. An empty field was being prepared as a helipad, with about 200 police personnel asked to report to the village on Tuesday.The sudden rush for damage-control also led to a bizarre situation. After the Chief Ministers visit was confirmed on Monday, officials at the DMs office inquired about the financial status of Rams widow to facilitate the cash compensation  only to realise that she didnt have a bank account.The Bahujan Samaj Party, meanwhile, has called for a Jan Akrosh rally on Wednesday to protest the killing. We will not let this issue die. Cases of caste-based discrimination are growing and have become a problem in Bageshwar. Karnataks father and brother, who threatened Rams family, are still absconding. We are expecting 2,500 people at the rally, said Sundar Kumar Syunewal, district head, BSP.According to the 2001 census, Bageshwar district has the highest proportion of Scheduled Castes  25.9 per cent  in Uttarakhand. According to local leaders and officials, a few cases of caste discrimination and violence have been reported from the area but such brutality is not common.The National Crime Records Bureau report for 2015 says that crimes against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes grew by 59 per cent in Uttarakhand between 2014 and 2015. While 62 cases were reported in 2014, this number grew to 93 in 2015.This year, conflict over caste-based discrimination in Uttarakhand flared up four months ago, when Dalit leader Daulat Kunwar and BJP MP Tarun Vijay raised the issue of entry of Dalits in temples in the state. Kunwar and Vijay had entered the Silgur Devta Temple near Dehradun in May, following which the priests carried out a nine-day long cleansing ceremony.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(ANI) Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar speaking to the media. (ANI)Amid reports of clearance given to GM mustard by a government panel, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has sought intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to overrule the approval considering its ill effects on human health. In a letter to the Prime Minister, Kumar has sought Modis intervention to immediately overrule the clearance to GM mustard seeds given by a technical panel of the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee.He expressed apprehension that approval to GM mustard would open a gate to several genetically modified food crops being developed by public as well private-research bodies like GM rice, maize, rice, brinjal, wheat, tomato among others which are at various stages of approval process. Kumar said GM mustard was a herbicide tolerant (HT) crop. Any gene making the plant resistant to a herbicide locks farmers into using select brands of agro-chemicals. The full adverse implications of HT crops are apparent world over.It is unclear why this herbicide tolerant (HT) GM mustard, which seeks to promote itself as a hybridisation technology, is even being considered by the Government of India when we already have non-GM hybrids available? he wondered.He said, I had already writtent to Union forest minister in January, 2016 pointing out that when the interested parties have failed to win the confidence of the farmers of the country, they are pushing the technology through public institutions. It is surprising that this so called public sector GM mustard came into being a year after a MNCs GM mustard was rejected by the Indian regulators in 2002.Strongly opposing genetic modification of crops, the Bihar Chief Minister told the Prime Minister that Bt cotton, which had been cultivated in the country for 15 years now demonstrated amply that GM was a failed technology. Bollworm, a cotton pest for which GM technology was brought in for pest control has developed resistance against the Bt cotton and is able to survive and wreak havoc on Bt cotton crop. Thousands of farmers have incurred losses in the country due to this, he told the Prime Minister in the letter.Reminding Modi about stress given by him on cooperative federalism and need to uphold federal policy, he said, This issue of GM crops is an important area where this has to be demonstrated urgently.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Express Photo by Pramod Adhikari)Raising the slogan of Jai Bhim-Lal Salaam, former JNU Students Union president Kanhaiya Kumar on Sunday pitched for a rainbow coalition of Ambedkarites and Communists and vowed to apprise people of the Centres anti-people policies in his first speech in poll-bound UP since the sedition case in February.At a programme organised by the All India Students Federation in Lucknows Ravindralaya auditorium, Kumar said there was a fight going on between the followers of Bhimrao Ambedkar and RSS icon M S Golwalkar, adding that Ambedkars followers would emerge victorious.Launching a tirade against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Centre and the RSS, Kanhaiya said they were trying to convert the nation into a Hindu Rashtra and ignoring the poor. Nobody would have thought that the PM will one day become a model to sell the SIM card of a particular company, he added.Modiji, you are not the nation, Sangh is not the Parliament and the Manu Smriti is not the Constitution. We speak against you, Sangh and the Manu Smriti. We believe in the Constitution and Ambedkar. We believe in the nation of Ambedkar, Kanhaiya said, adding that a 65-year-old could not become the leader of a young nation like India and most people do not believe in his personality-centric politics.Referring to the lynching of Mohammed Akhlaq in Dadri over suspicion that he had stored beef, Kumar said that when India is filled with diversity, numerous languages and varied food habits, how can one ask the whole country to eat a particular thing. He said that Modis is the only government which says it will complete its policies in 2022 and not 2019 when its term gets over.Kanhaiya said the government had failed to deliver on many of its promise. He had promised to give employment to 2 crore people in a year, but could not provide anything. We will go to people with these anti-people actions. Be it the police, sedition, or hurling of shoes and tomatoes, nothing will be able to stop us, he added, demanding unemployment allowance for those who are not provided employment.Kanhaiya said the idea that election of a Dalit or a woman chief minister will lead to development of these sections or that an OBC leaders government will lead to the progress of backward castes is also wrong.He said that people need to form a rainbow coalition based on the ideas of thinkers like Ambedkar, Karl Marx, Lenin and Mao Zedong to create a Samatamulak Samaj.Watch what else is making newsCPI leader Dr Girish said that Kanhaiyas second address, slated for Monday in Faizabad, is yet to get required permissions by the district administration. He added that Kumar will address audiences across the state in the coming days and though this is not part of the election campaign, it was a way of enlightening people about the current political situation.Left parties, which have no significant presence in the state, are likely to contest about 200 assembly seats jointly.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo Oinam Anand) Deepak Pental (second from left) with fellow scientists at a mustard trial field in Jaunti village of North West Delhi. (Express Photo Oinam Anand)It is Indias largest source of edible oil.Unlike soyabean, which has only 18 per cent oil content, and groundnut, more than 50 per cent of whose kernels are either consumed directly or exported, rapeseed/mustard is one crop that is a true oilseed. With annual production of around 2.4 million tonnes (mt), mustard accounts for a quarter of the countrys average edible oil availability of 9.4 mt from indigenous sources (see chart).That being the case, mustard would be central to any strategy aimed at reducing Indias reliance on edible oil imports, which, in 2014-15 (November-October), amounted to over 14.4 mt valued at $10.5 billion. The fact that it is a rabi crop with almost 75 per cent area under irrigation  as against barely 25 per cent in groundnut and one per cent for soyabean  and having roughly 40 per cent oil content, makes mustard the most suitable candidate for ushering in a yellow revolution, similar to what wheat and paddy did for the Green Revolution.For years, breeders have exploited a phenomenon known as heterosis or hybrid vigour resulting from crossing two genetically dissimilar plant varieties even within the same species. The first-generation or F1 offspring from such crosses tend to have yields higher than what either parent can individually give.Share This Article Related Article Let the farmer judgeLet the farmer judge The other oil: How a product almost entirely imported has defied food inflationThe other oil: How a product almost entirely imported has defied food inflation Call Luddites bluffCall Luddites bluff GM row again, with mustard toppingGM row again, with mustard topping A perennial deficit: The other oil problemA perennial deficit: The other oil problem Edible oils up on millers buying,global cuesIn mustard, though, there have been two major constraints standing in the way of realising yield grains from heterosis that can help considerably boost domestic production.The first is the narrow genetic base of mustard varieties grown in India. Scientists at the Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants (CGMCP) in Delhi University, led by former vice-chancellor Deepak Pental, however, showed that this problem could be addressed by crossing Indian mustard cultivars with juncea lines of East European origin like Early Heera and Donskaja. The combination of the two divergent gene pools enhanced the crossing options; the resultant F1 progeny were found to exhibit significant heterosis.The second constraint is more basic, having to do with the absence of a natural hybridisation system in mustard. Mustard flowers contain both female (pistil) and male (stamen) reproductive organs, making the plants largely self-pollinating. To the extent that the egg cells of one plant cannot be fertilised by the pollen grains from the stamen of another, it restricts the scope for developing hybrids  which, in crops such as maize, cotton and tomato, is possible through simple emasculation or physical removal of anthers.Pentals team at the CGMCP initially developed a cytoplasmic male-sterile or CMS line of Pusa Bold Indian mustard. This line (in which the stamen is sterile and cannot produce viable pollen), crossed with the East European Early Heera-2 variety (which is male-fertile and hence capable of pollinating the former), resulted in DMH-1, Indias first ever mustard hybrid. Its average seed yield, at 2.6 tonnes per hectare, was a fifth higher than the 2.1-2.2 tonnes for existing best check varieties, including Pusa Bold, Pusa Jaikisan, Varuna, Rohini and Kranti.The CGMCP scientists also bred another hybrid DMH-4, from crossing Pusa Bold with S-7, a derivative from Indian and East European mustard lines. The yields from it were the same as DMH-1, but the new hybrid produced bolder seeds.The CMS-based hybrid breeding system, however, had drawbacks. It could work only in a single Indian mustard variety (Pusa Bold). Using the same CMS (female) parental line, thus, limited the crossing options. We tried transferring our CMS system (126-1) to many Indian and East European mustard lines. But in all these cases, the male sterility broke down and such partially fertile lines couldnt be used for hybrid seed production. The system was also unstable, especially under low temperatures, explains Pental.The inherent limitations in CMS-based hybrid breeding, then, led Pentals team to explore the genetic modification or GM route. The technology they chose involved deploying alien Barnase and Barstar genes. The Barnase gene, isolated from a soil bacterium called Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, coded for a protein that impaired pollen production and rendered the plant into which it was incorporated male-sterile. This plant was, then, crossed with a fertile parental line, containing, in turn, the Barstar gene from the same bacterium that blocked the action of the Barnase gene. The resultant F1 progeny was high-yielding and could also produce seed/grain, thanks to the Barstar gene in the second fertile line.The CGMCP scientists used the Barnase-Barstar GM technology, originally patented by Plant Genetic Systems (now part of Bayer CropScience), to create a robust and viable hybridisation system in mustard. This system was also used to develop DMH-11 through crossing Varuna (Barnase) with Early Heera-2 (Barstar). This GM hybrid, which has demonstrated up to 30 per cent heterosis in field trials, is currently awaiting approval for commercial cultivation.The Barnase-Barstar system enables us to breed hybrids from a wide range of Indian and East European mustards yielding higher levels of heterosis. Besides, we can introduce new traits relating to oil quality (zero erucic acid, low glucosinolates content) or resistance to disease (alternaria blight and stem rot), which wasnt possible with just a single, unstable CMS parental line, Pental points out.CGMCP has, in fact, tied up with the University of Arizona to map the Indian mustard (Brassica juncea), which itself has two constituent genomes AA (from the Brassica rapa species) and BB (from Brassica nigra), each containing 30,000 genes.The rapa genome has already been sequenced, while the work on nigra will be completed by the end of 2016. Once this is done, we will be able to know and locate the genes that code for specific traits, be it oil content, seed size, pod length and density, number of seeds per pod or disease resistance, adds Pental.GM technology will only help in developing hybrids with new parental combinations and incorporating these various quantitative, qualitative and disease resistant traits into them.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

All the shops on either side of the 5-km stretch were closed, with 30 platoons of policemen and 60 officers deployed to ensure compliance. Some portions of the route were cordoned off with ropes. Several members of the Chhatra Congress and ABVP were detained before they could enter the campus and show black flags.Patnaik has Z-plus security. However, Bhubaneswar Deputy Commissioner of Police Satyabrata Bhoi admitted that the measures were not part of that security detail. We had intelligence reports that there may be disturbances like last year. So security was enhanced, Bhoi said.The disturbances the DCP was referring to related to the February 2015 incident in which students, led by NSUI state president Satyajit Patnaik, had pelted eggs at Patnaiks vehicle while he was on his way to the same universitys annual function.Following the incident, an additional DCP-ranked officer in charge of the states Special Security Battalion, supposed to supervise and suggest alternative routes for Patnaiks travel, was suspended and had to face departmental proceedings. Besides, Satyajit Patnaik and five others were arrested and had a difficult time getting bail as police pressed attempt-to-murder charges.Satyajit Patnaik, who had to spend five days in jail, says, I had been married just four days before the incident happened. After the protest, I left for Dubai and was arrested two months after I came back.Accusing Patnaik of being scared of the public, state Congress chief Prasad Harichandan said, Have you heard of people dying after being pelted with eggs? The security put in place for Patnaiks visit to Utkal University was unprecedented, Harichandan added, especially for a politician who claims to be extremely popular.Other ministers of the state Cabinet have also been victims of egg and tomato attacks in recent months, including Law and Panchayati Raj Minister Arun Sahoo, Agriculture Minister Pradeep Maharathy, Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Minister Sanjay Dasburma, Health Minister Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak and School and Mass Eduction Minister Debi Prasad Mishra.On Saturday, Congress activists pelted eggs and rotten tomatoes at the official residence of Urban Development and Labour Minister Pushpendra Singhdeo. The minister, who was away in his native district of Kalahandi, said his family who was at the house was very shaken.In December last year, girl students, mostly NSUI supporters, had been detained in a room when Patnaik visited Rama Devi Womens University in Bhubaneswar. Trying to justify the detention, Biju Janata Dal MLA Priyadarsi Mishra had likened the girl students to human bombs, causing outrage.The students had later lodged a case against university officers with police, and filed complaints in the Odisha Human Rights Commission and State Womens Commission.Watch Video: Whats making newsIn January this year, ahead of a seminar on higher education to be attended by the CM, the audience was frisked twice. Council of Higher Secondary Education Chairman Basudev Chhaoti and Utkal University registrar S K Das along with college teachers and many others had entered the auditorium after routine frisking and passing through a metal detector, but had to vacate the auditorium and re-enter after another security check, with policemen searching for any egg-like missiles in their pockets.We did not want to take a chance after the egg-throwing incident of February. It was a closed space and the CM would have been more vulnerable, said a police officer who was part of the security bandobast.A senior inspector of a police station in Bhubaneswar said they ensure all local vegetable shops, eggs shops, fruit shops and shops selling water bottles are shut before the CMs carcade passes through an area.Official sources say a proposal is being considered now to install a baggage scanner and a mechanical gate at the CMs residence, as well as to create a buffer zone around it. Besides, a net or a similar obstruction is being installed on the back boundary wall of Naveen Niwas so that no one can scale over it or throw something inside.As per another proposal, officers including drivers in the CMs staff are to be given anti-extremist training. The narrow road adjoining the Naveen Niwas already has concertina wires around it.DCP Bhoi said that in Odisha, both the CM and Governor are entitled to Z-plus security. But the security is more elaborate and changes as per threat perception. If tomorrow the CM goes to Malkangiri, he will get five times the security he gets in Bhubaneswar, he said.Assistant Commissioner of Police Aseem Kumar Panda admitted the egg attacks were indeed becoming a headache. But we can prevent them. We are devising a plan, he said.While Patnaiks Additional Chief Secretary U N Behera refused to talk about the additional security measures, BJD leaders defended that Patnaik needed to be cautious in a Maoist-affected state like Odisha.Police take a call on it. Why are opposition people so worried about his security? said MLA Mishra.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
