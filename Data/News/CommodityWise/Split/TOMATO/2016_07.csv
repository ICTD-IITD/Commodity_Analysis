Due to cash crunch, the contractor is not able to pay them daily. Things were fine till the old notes were exchanged by banks, but now the labour is hardly getting any wages.Another official said there is no point in letting Pakistani trucks in India. If goods come from Pakistan, there is no labour to unload the trucks, he added.Rajdeep Uppal, president, Confederation of International Chamber of Commerce, said most of the labourers do not have bank accounts and they demand cash. Even those who have accounts dont accept cheques as its not easy to withdraw money from banks these days, he said.Uppal added that the cash crunch has not only affected the labour but also traders. The orders placed by us are still stuck across the border and we are just waiting for the situation to ease.Also, the export from India through the border has also virtually come to a standstill as trucks carrying tomatoes are not getting quarantine import permits from Pakistani authorities due to unknown reasons, traders claimed.Talking to HT, a customs official said, While the import has totally stopped due to cash crunch, only a few trucks carrying cotton are going to Pakistan these days."

His sales have, however, dropped over the past month since buyers are low on cash. Now, the saplings too are currently threatened for want of farm hands.Read | Demonetisation will hit farmers, informal workers; long-term outlook positiveOur business involves lot of cash rotation. The complications are mounting with every passing day. I have never seen such an uncertain scenario in the past 50 years since I took over my family business and started producing saplings, says Khokh, 70.His problem is he has money, but cant access it. The day Modi made his announcement, Khokh had Rs2.8 lakh in high-value currency which he deposited in a bank. Since then, he has been struggling to withdraw cash for payment to the labourers.He is in a labour intensive business and needs to pay anywhere between 20 and 60 workers daily. These days, I am cash strapped, and there are other expenses to buy fertiliser, pesticides, diesel and equipment which I am unable to do, Khokh laments.Khokhs inconveniences spell bigger trouble for farmers who buy seeds and saplings from him. Coming amid the sowing season for rabi crop, the scarcity of cash is estimated to have delayed sowing in at least one-third of Punjabs 35 lakh hectares of crop land. Khokh says the sowing for vegetables scheduled to start in January could also be in jeopardy.The demonetisation has adversely impacted agricultural activities, admits GS Kalkat, chairman of Punjabs state farmers commission.Khokh could not have agreed more. He is currently preparing saplings of chilly over five acres which should be sufficient to grow the spicy ingredient over 900 acres. He needs money for that purpose but the squeeze in liquidity has put him in a tight spot.He recently sold 1,500 quintals of potato seeds, one-third of which was on credit since farmers did not have the cash to buy. I am sure farmers who come to buy chilly seeds will seek credit again. My business will be finished, Khokh says.Khokh is at one end of the agricultural chain. Sukhwinder Singh of Bhattian in Ludhiana is at the other by being a farmer who usually buys seeds from him.A farmer who plans to grow potato over 10 acres needs a cash investment of around Rs3 lakh. Costs include saplings, festiliser and pesticides. Most of the purchases are in cash, something we hardly have these days, points out Singh.The problem facing Jagdev Singh of Muteon is pressing. He had some cash savings which he spent on his daughters wedding recently. Now no one would give me saplings on credit. Banks are of little help. I do not know how to sow crop this season, he says.Farmers  both growing seeds and crops  are predicting a slump in vegetable produce this coming season. Growing crops will be a challenge. Selling them will be no less a problem. Traders have already lowered the buying price citing cash crunch and farmers will be forced to sell in distress. Traders loss is also farmers loss, Khokh explains.This is Part 5 of our ongoing series on the effect of demonetisation on rural India. The earlier parts focussed on Sunderbans, Bastar, Jammu & Kashmir and Vidarbha."

Some vendors picked up tomatoes for free, while cattle feasted on the remaining dump.Apparently, he has come all the way to Hyderabad, because tomato prices came down drastically in Anantapur market, Srinivas, a local commission agent, told the media.The situation is similar in other parts of Rayalaseema that are known for production of tomatoes.Read | My business will be finished: Cash crunch hits farmers in PunjabUttar PradeshThe state government has approached several potato-deficit states, offering them to lift surplus potato from the state at an affordable rate in a bid to help its farmers get a better price.The government move comes amidst prevailing low prices of potato that have added to the plight of farmers. The state government has written to potato-deficit states like Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, telling them they can procure potato from UP, horticulture director SP Joshi said.Joshi also blamed farmers, saying they erred in anticipating the price. Potato was selling for Rs 1,500 per quintal till July-August but most farmers chose to sit on the stock, guessing the price will go up further. That did not happen and a new crop of potato from within and outside the state also arrived, compounding the price situation, he explained. UP accounts for 35-40 % of the countrys potato production.Read | Post demonetisation, a farmers wish list from the budgetMadhya PradeshFor the second time this year, onion farmers of Mandsaur-Neemuch belt are forced to sell their crop for as low as Rs 1 per kg. Many are abandoning their produce and the main culprit appears to be demonetisation, say those associated with the trade. Explaining the impact of the move, an official said small traders, who bring in supply from marginal farmers, have vanished due to shortage of cash and big traders seem to have formed a cartel.Cashless transactions could bring traders under the I-T departments scanner  which they dont want  the official added.State horticulture director Satyanand, however, blamed local factors for the crash, saying there was no spike in supply. In April, the government procured onions for Rs 6 per kilogram after prices fell to 25 paise per kg in Neemuch.Lalaram Bhatt, a farmer, was in tears after hearing about the price crash. We are already facing cash shortage problems due to demonetisation and this fall in onion prices is a double blow. At these prices, we wont be able to pay even for transport, he said.Read | In cashless times, farmers sell onions at Rs 1 per kilo in NeemuchBiharHigh cauliflower yield coupled with a cash crunch after demonetisation has sent wholesale prices crashing in Bihar. Farmers in Patna, Vaisali, Muzaffarpur and other districts are forced to sell produce at throwaway rates. On Saturday, the price of the seasonal vegetable was at its lowest  Rs 10 - Rs 15 per kg  in major retail markets. In wholesale markets, the price was almost one-third.This time, there has been a bumper production, especially in the last leg of the harvest. This is probably the reason for falling prices, said Ranjeet Kumar, a vegetable retailer.Read |After crop failure, Vidarbha farmers in Maharashtra crippled by note ban"

I promise you I will give you the India which you desired. If someone faces problem, I also feel the pain. I understand their problem but this is only for 50 days, Modi had said in rallies in Gujarat and Goa, referring to the long queues at ATMs and the acute scarcity of cash in cities and towns.With the deadline set by the PM having expired, HT revisited persons and places we had serialised earlier  from Budgam in Kashmir to Guruvayoor in Kerala  to do a reality check on whether Modi has delivered on his pledge to ease the situation for his countrymen. The feedback was mixed:Satleja, SunderbansA mother of two, Pampa Mistry is much happier now. For the most part of November and early December, she had been worried about her husband, Ramesh, who returned late in the night despite the danger posed by lurking Royal Bengal tigers.As a business correspondent of the State Bank of India and the only source of currency for residents of the remote island with no bank branches or ATMs, Ramesh had to put in long hours in the wake of the November 8 demonetisation announcement.As long queues formed outside his office and tempers rose over non-availability of cash, Ramesh struggled and had to stay back in office till late.Read | 50 days of demonetisation: ATM queues shorter but ripples to remain in JanuaryThings have got better now and he is returning home before sunset, much to the delight of his wife.Earlier I used to get only Rs 20,000 a day from the SBI Gosaba branch for distribution among the villagers, that too mostly in denominations of Rs 2,000. But now I get Rs 50,000 every day and all in denominations of Rs 50. The villagers are happy and I am relieved, Ramesh says.I can go home early now, he adds.Yavatmal, MaharashtraKalawati Bandurkar, the widow of a farmer who committed suicide and found herself in the headlines after Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi visited her, is still in distress.Today some guests are coming to my house with a marriage proposal for my youngest daughter, Sonia, but I cant offer them anything more than a cup of tea. There is no money at home, she says.Kalawati has been struggling since November 8 to lay her hands on cash. Following Gandhis visit, an NGO extended financial help and opened a fixed deposit in her name at a bank. Kalawati is entitled to Rs 14,000 as monthly interest, but has been finding it difficult to withdraw money from the nearest bank some 25 km away.She visited the Central Bank of India in Maregaon two days ago and had to return with just Rs 6,000 after a four-hour wait.Read | 1000 raids in 50 days: Taxman monitoring deposits of Rs 2 lakh and aboveResidents of the region notorious for farm distress and farmer suicides have similar complaints, alleging that the situation at banks has not improved.Shrihari Dhoke from Chanoda says non-availability of cash is derailing his plans for Rabi crop despite a good Kharif harvest. As every link in this chain is almost entirely settled in cash, the absence of currency in the system has affected the overall post-harvest activity, he pointed out.Lanura, KashmirUnlike the rest of the country, the Valley never witnessed queues outside ATMs. Locals attributed the phenomenon to months of unrest that left people impoverished. No money meant no queues, they said in the days following the demonetisation announcement.Though declared the states first cashless village, Lanura, about 25km from Srinagar, epitomises the challenges faced by the administration, post-demonetisation.Read | Note ban not enough: Corruption in India is like water, it finds a wayLanura is cashless in the sense it is facility-less.

And do you think we can do e-transactions when the mobile internet network is so weak in the village? he added.Consequently, the local grocer, chemist, tailor and gas cylinder seller are all using cash in their daily transactions.Khokh, PunjabNek Singh, who sells seeds and saplings  from potatoes to tomatoes, chillies and onions has not had a change of heart.Few weeks ago, the owner of the sprawling nursery had been critical of note-bandi. Weeks later, he still insists demonetisation is ruinous for farmers.Even now there is no money in the banksWe have to wait for days to get meagre cash, which is not sufficient to meet expenses for our family and agricultural needs, he said.He pointed out that vegetable growers have suffered immensely. Potato prices have crashed to Rs 2.5 a kilogram, carrot to Rs 2 and cauliflower to just Rs 1 a kilogram. Traders have no money and farmers are begging before commission agents in mandis to buy their produce at whatever price and commission agents are fleecing them, he pointed out.Punjab farmer Nek Singh complains that vegetable growers like him have been hit by demonetisation as the value of their yield has fallen. (Bharat Bhushan/HT Photo)Singh has had a bumper potato crop but that brings him no cheer. The potatoes that I have grown over 40 acres will accrue me a loss of at least Rs 8 lakh. Is there a plan with the government to compensate the farmers? he asked angrily.His potatoes are ripe and ready for harvest but he has been unable to muster courage to start extracting the vegetables. Other potato farmers have lost Rs 20,000 rupees per acre. Imagine what my loss would be, he muttered.Guruvayoor, KeralaEven the six-odd ATMs in the immediate vicinity of the famous Guruvayoor Sri Krishna temple with a bank balance of Rs 1,500 crore and 500 kg gold reserves had run out of cash following demonetisation.But now, things have improved and the machines are again spewing out cash.Read | Farmers hit as vegetable prices crash down after demonetisationThe makers of equally famous Guruvayoor papad are also upbeat.

We are fighting to make our country economically independent and freedom from multi-national companies by promoting indigenous and natural products, he claimed. He also said that it would bail out the crisis-ridden farm sector of Vidarbha that is infamous for farmer suicides.The company plans to develop a modern food park by building a Rs 1000-crore plant, and manufacture juice made from the famous Nagpuri orange. This would be the first time that orange juice made from local fruit would be packaged as a brand, the yoga guru said.Union minister Gadkari, who has been instrumental in getting Ramdev to invest in food parks and allied business in the region, claimed that the yoga gurus company Patanjali would be a boon for the farmers of the region and it would usher in modernization of the Nagpur city.According to him, tribals from Gadchiroli, Gondia and Chandrapur who make a living collecting forest produces, like medicinal plants and herbs would benefit hugely from this initiative.Farmers will be trained by Patanjali workers to grow orange, aloe vera, tomato and herbs according to the specification of the company and given a purchase guarantee. A team of scientists and other experts are also working on the project that is expected to change the farm economy of the region.Speaking on the occasion, the chief minister, Fadnavis dismissed the allegations levelled by the former Union minister, Vilas Muttemwar that the government has given the plot of land to Patanjali at less than half of the cost that other investors have paid at MIHAN.The process involved at giving the land to Patanjali was transparent. We had floated tenders thrice and Patanjali Ayurveda was found to be the right choice in the bidding as per the central vigilance commission norms, Fadnavis said.The government wanted a commitment to procure raw materials to the tune of at least Rs 100 crore per annum from the farmers and members of tribal community within the surrounding area.It also laid a condition that the bidder should commit to train minimum 2,000 farmers per year across Maharashtra to improve productivity, quality and market intelligence to get them ready for agro business development in consultation with agriculture department. Patanjali has assured to fulfill all these norms, the chief minister said. The plant is expected to link nearly 50,000 farmers suppliers, create direct employment for over 10,000 people and eventually provide indirect employment to lakhs of families.Regarding the land deal, senior Congress leader Muttemwar had said that as against the running rate of Rs 60-lakh per acre, Patanjali has been charged only Rs 25-lakh an acre. He said that this deal was against all norms and hence should be probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) as the state-run MIHAN had acquired land from farmers and was giving it on a platter to Patanjali as a special favour.Muttemwar alleged that the deal was nothing but the BJP government was repaying a favour to Ramdev who had campaigned wholeheartedly for the party during the 2014 general elections."

What once took up to 15 daysif farmers bothered to apply at allnow takes as little as four days.In doing so, Wild Severun by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), a nonprofit that works with the governments forest departments in 284 villages in Karnataka and Tamil Naduhelps soothe the tension and violence evident between Indias rising human population and falling population of wild animals.Earlier it was difficult to interact with villagers when there was wildlife conflict, as they used to get aggressive. From the time Wild Seve started, it has educated them about the importance of wildlife and sustainability, said a forest official, who asked not to be named, as he is not authorised to talk to the media. It has brought a sense of calmness in villagers while dealing with our department.In Murthys village of Chillakahalli and Gowdas Vadeyannapura on the bucolic outskirts of south Karnatakas largest national parkas on populated forest fringes nationwidehuman-animal conflicts are a growing issue, as IndiaSpend reported in May 2014.Gowda received Rs 9,000 as compensation for his cow, but he is satisfied. Previously, we had to pay money to get compensation, he said. First, we had to hire a photographer to take photos of crop raids or cattle kills. Then we had to travel by bus to the forest department, and there was no guarantee we would find them (officials).Farmer Mahadeva Gowda is seen standing next to the carcass of his cow, which was killed by a tiger in August 2015. Gowda is a beneficiary of a new programme called Wild Seve, or wild service, which deploys specially trained locals called field agents who hand-hold villagers to navigate formidable government compensation procedures.Murthy used Wild Seves toll-free number when elephants destroyed his sugarcane crop. Field agent Mahadevaswamywho also attended to Gowdas callinformed and brought along a forest official to validate and document the claim. Photos must be taken and official documents filled, all of which are handled by field agents.Mahadevaswamy said he gets a call a dayif not morefor crop raids and more occasional cattle or poultry kills. His jurisdiction extends to 70 villages within a 20-km radius of Bandipurs forests, and he attends to a call within eight hours of receiving it.Since its launch last year, Wild Seves team of seven field agents has helped file claims for 3,261 incidents of crop and property damage by elephants and other herbivores, 148 cases of livestock predation by big cats and wild dogs, 11 cases of injury and two human deaths.Of these, 2,998 toll-free calls came from Bandipur and 422 from Nagarahole. Until July 2016, nearly 1,000 families have either received or are about to receive compensation.The hope is that as villagers receive compensation for their losses quickly and clearly, they will be more willing to live with wildlife. The compensation is now coming in good time, and so it has built a sense of relief and confidence in us, Gowda said. Even if the crop is raided several times, we believe it will be compensated.In the absence of easy compensation, many species are attacked. There have been reports of villagers retaliating by poisoning tigers or forcing the government to shoot big cats.Krithi Karanth, the scientist behind Wild SeveIn 2014, conservation scientist Krithi Karanth found that between 74% and 86% of households around five areas in Karnataka (Nagarhole, Bandipur, Dandeli, B R Hills, Bhadra) and one each in Madhya Pradesh (Kanha National Park) and Rajasthan (Ranthambore National Park) reported conflicts with wildlife. Her previous research found that less than a third of villagers who lost crops, livestock, property and family to such conflict received government compensation.Along with mitigation, compensation has a role to play, as conflict will continue to occur, said Karanth. My research showed that although people were trying multiple mitigation measuresfences, guarding fields, noise (firecrackers or drums)very few measures worked. Hence, the solutions have to include both pre- and post-conflict assistance to people.Using her data and research, Karanth, in July 2015, in collaboration with the WCS, launched Wild Seve, now running in 284 villages around Bandipur and its contiguous area in Tamil Nadu, the Nagarhole national park.Wild Seve is challenging because compensation procedures vary across forest ranges in Bandipur and Nagarhole. Some require a certificate from a veterinarian, confirming that cattle were indeed killed by wild animals. Others ask for proof of land ownership.Field agents now take care of these procedures, which often deterred villagers from seeking compensation.Recently, Wild Seve distributed identity cards with unique identification numbers to villagers who face repeated wildlife conflicts. Every conflict is now recorded against this number, building a conflict database, which allows easy tracking and follow-up of the compensation processes.Farmer Shiva Murthy receiving his unique identification number card from Wild Seves field co-ordinator Chikkaningaih and field agent Mahadevaswamy. Every conflict is now recorded against this number, building a conflict database, which allows easy tracking and follow-up of the compensation processes.Basically, Wild Seve has helped in simplifying the logistics and cutting down bureaucracy, said Ghanshyam Iyer, project coordinator of Wild Seve and a WCS member.Back in Chillakahalli village, near gently swaying saplings of sugarcane and cotton, women chat as they harvest tomatoes, aware that they share space with tigers, leopards, wild dogs and elephants and that, at some time, damage from visiting animals might set off a burdensome compensation process.As Gowda said, Now, all it takes is one phone call.(Padmanaban is a Bangalore-based journalist who reports on environment and energy.)IndiaSpend welcomes feedback.

The cost of tomatoes had earlier risen from Rs 30 to Rs 60 around the second week of June.Residents said that tomatoes are essential in any kitchen and the ever increasing prices have forced them to avoid using the fruit in any dish.

The fruit is too expensive that I first thought my vegetable seller was joking about the rates.The prices of onions, potatoes and brinjals have also increased by Rs 20 per kilogram on an average. The prices are likely to rise further in the next couple of days because of a delay in supplies and as the local production has been exhausted.Even the wholesale prices are extremely high.

The poster reads: Thug ki sarkar (crooks government). Below, the punchline reads: Kaho dil se, Akhilesh fir se, urging the masses to vote the Samajwadi Party back to power in Uttar Pradesh.Interestingly, like the BJP earlier, the Samajwadi Party leaders have also distanced themselves from these posters.This might be a reaction from the masses to the earlier posters by BJP which were an insensitive depiction of an unfortunate incident at Jawahar Bagh. We do not indulge in such politics, said Vipul Purohit, in charge of Samajwadi Party in Agra.On Friday, posters bearing the BJPs lotus targetted the Samajwadi Party government for the violence in Mathuras Jawahar Bagh.State leaders of the saffron party had distanced themselves from the posters."

No such dress code has been prescribed in the policy framed by the Chandigarh administration recently, said home secretary of the Union Territory, Anurag Agarwal.Hundreds of users on Twitter and Facebook ridiculed the administration and charged it with sexism after a national daily reported that women in miniskirts wont be allowed into discothques in Chandigarh. But Agarwal said the official policy was misrepresented.The newspaper report said the administration in its policy Controlling of Places of Public Amusement, 2016 said permission could be denied to discothque owners to run their business if a Union Territory committee found exhibition or advertisement of scantily dressed women and indecency or if it was seditious and likely to excite political discontent. The policy came into effect on April 1.The policy draft, however, does not define scantily dressed women or indecency and also doesnt elaborate on sedition, the newspaper article read.The report sparked furore on Twitter and Facebook.Babus in Centre ruled Chandigarh will now decide which skirt is fit for city's women when they go to a disco or pub.

He gets up at dawn to supervise the harvesting of his tomato crop, spread over 45 acre of lush green field. Some days are more hectic when tomatoes are loaded onto a truck bound for Azadpur mandi in Delhi or Attari border in Amritsar.The climate in Nimar is favorable for growing tomatoes- both the desi and hybrid varieties. Besides catering to the domestic market, we export tomatoes to Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal by road, Mourya told HT.The hybrid variety of tomato is in great demand in Pakistan where they use it for making meat curries while the small desi variety is much sought after in Nepal, he said.Like Mourya, many farmers in Khargone and Ratlam districts export tomatoes to Pakistan. The trade takes place through export agencies in Amritsar via the Attari-Wagah border. While business was good in 2015, this year, exports have plunged as Pakistan has harvested good tomato crop due to an unusually warm winter.During the peak season in October-November, 50-60 trucks, each with a capacity of 15 tonne, pass through the border every day. Tomatoes are mainly sourced from Nashik in Maharashtra and MP, Sanjiv Puri, an Amritsar-based custom house agent, told HT over the phone.Cold climate is not suitable for tomato crop, especially in areas where there is frost and snowfall so the yield is poor in Pakistan, said Krishnapal Singh, Shivpal Mouryas younger brother. Few people know that tomato prices have crashed in the domestic market not only due to arrival of fresh crop but also because of oversupply as exports to Pakistan through the Wagah border are almost negligible this season, he said.State agriculture director ML Meena said, Areas under tomato cultivation in the state has gone up due to the growing demand in the domestic as well as overseas markets.Tomatoes grown in Khargone, Ratlam and other parts of the state are superior in quality, he said.Shortages of tomatoes in Pakistan give handsome returns to growers in MP, farmers said. We get more than double the price in Pakistan compared to the domestic prices but then the transportation costs are higher, said Anoopchand, a farmer who exported tomatoes worth Rs 1.10 crore in 2015.Exports to Bangladesh will pick up in March and we also export to Nepal where the small-sized desi varieties are in demand as they use whole tomatoes in their recipes, he said.The tomato crop, which takes three to four months to mature, is grown twice a year- in July-October period and in November-February.Hybrid versus desiTomatoes grown in Khargone, Ratlam and other parts of the state are superior in qualityFor hybrid tomato, two different varieties of tomato plants are combined to produce a variety with beneficial traits from both the parents. Some of the benefits include improved disease resistance, higher-quality fruit and bigger size. Hybrid tomatoes, which have longer shelf life, are often more expensive.In numbers70.23 lakh hectares: Tomato cultivation area in MP (2015)90 tonnes: Average tomato yield in MP (per hectare production)Rs 16 per kg: Average domestic wholesale prices in Oct-Nov 2015Rs 25 per kg: Pakistans average import price in Oct-Nov 2015"
