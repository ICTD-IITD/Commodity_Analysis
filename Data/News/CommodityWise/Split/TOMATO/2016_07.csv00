His sales have, however, dropped over the past month since buyers are low on cash. Now, the saplings too are currently threatened for want of farm hands.Read | Demonetisation will hit farmers, informal workers; long-term outlook positiveOur business involves lot of cash rotation. The complications are mounting with every passing day. I have never seen such an uncertain scenario in the past 50 years since I took over my family business and started producing saplings, says Khokh, 70.His problem is he has money, but cant access it. The day Modi made his announcement, Khokh had Rs2.8 lakh in high-value currency which he deposited in a bank. Since then, he has been struggling to withdraw cash for payment to the labourers.He is in a labour intensive business and needs to pay anywhere between 20 and 60 workers daily. These days, I am cash strapped, and there are other expenses to buy fertiliser, pesticides, diesel and equipment which I am unable to do, Khokh laments.Khokhs inconveniences spell bigger trouble for farmers who buy seeds and saplings from him. Coming amid the sowing season for rabi crop, the scarcity of cash is estimated to have delayed sowing in at least one-third of Punjabs 35 lakh hectares of crop land. Khokh says the sowing for vegetables scheduled to start in January could also be in jeopardy.The demonetisation has adversely impacted agricultural activities, admits GS Kalkat, chairman of Punjabs state farmers commission.Khokh could not have agreed more. He is currently preparing saplings of chilly over five acres which should be sufficient to grow the spicy ingredient over 900 acres. He needs money for that purpose but the squeeze in liquidity has put him in a tight spot.He recently sold 1,500 quintals of potato seeds, one-third of which was on credit since farmers did not have the cash to buy. I am sure farmers who come to buy chilly seeds will seek credit again. My business will be finished, Khokh says.Khokh is at one end of the agricultural chain. Sukhwinder Singh of Bhattian in Ludhiana is at the other by being a farmer who usually buys seeds from him.A farmer who plans to grow potato over 10 acres needs a cash investment of around Rs3 lakh. Costs include saplings, festiliser and pesticides. Most of the purchases are in cash, something we hardly have these days, points out Singh.The problem facing Jagdev Singh of Muteon is pressing. He had some cash savings which he spent on his daughters wedding recently. Now no one would give me saplings on credit. Banks are of little help. I do not know how to sow crop this season, he says.Farmers  both growing seeds and crops  are predicting a slump in vegetable produce this coming season. Growing crops will be a challenge. Selling them will be no less a problem. Traders have already lowered the buying price citing cash crunch and farmers will be forced to sell in distress. Traders loss is also farmers loss, Khokh explains.This is Part 5 of our ongoing series on the effect of demonetisation on rural India. The earlier parts focussed on Sunderbans, Bastar, Jammu & Kashmir and Vidarbha."

Some vendors picked up tomatoes for free, while cattle feasted on the remaining dump.Apparently, he has come all the way to Hyderabad, because tomato prices came down drastically in Anantapur market, Srinivas, a local commission agent, told the media.The situation is similar in other parts of Rayalaseema that are known for production of tomatoes.Read | My business will be finished: Cash crunch hits farmers in PunjabUttar PradeshThe state government has approached several potato-deficit states, offering them to lift surplus potato from the state at an affordable rate in a bid to help its farmers get a better price.The government move comes amidst prevailing low prices of potato that have added to the plight of farmers. The state government has written to potato-deficit states like Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, telling them they can procure potato from UP, horticulture director SP Joshi said.Joshi also blamed farmers, saying they erred in anticipating the price. Potato was selling for Rs 1,500 per quintal till July-August but most farmers chose to sit on the stock, guessing the price will go up further. That did not happen and a new crop of potato from within and outside the state also arrived, compounding the price situation, he explained. UP accounts for 35-40 % of the countrys potato production.Read | Post demonetisation, a farmers wish list from the budgetMadhya PradeshFor the second time this year, onion farmers of Mandsaur-Neemuch belt are forced to sell their crop for as low as Rs 1 per kg. Many are abandoning their produce and the main culprit appears to be demonetisation, say those associated with the trade. Explaining the impact of the move, an official said small traders, who bring in supply from marginal farmers, have vanished due to shortage of cash and big traders seem to have formed a cartel.Cashless transactions could bring traders under the I-T departments scanner  which they dont want  the official added.State horticulture director Satyanand, however, blamed local factors for the crash, saying there was no spike in supply. In April, the government procured onions for Rs 6 per kilogram after prices fell to 25 paise per kg in Neemuch.Lalaram Bhatt, a farmer, was in tears after hearing about the price crash. We are already facing cash shortage problems due to demonetisation and this fall in onion prices is a double blow. At these prices, we wont be able to pay even for transport, he said.Read | In cashless times, farmers sell onions at Rs 1 per kilo in NeemuchBiharHigh cauliflower yield coupled with a cash crunch after demonetisation has sent wholesale prices crashing in Bihar. Farmers in Patna, Vaisali, Muzaffarpur and other districts are forced to sell produce at throwaway rates. On Saturday, the price of the seasonal vegetable was at its lowest  Rs 10 - Rs 15 per kg  in major retail markets. In wholesale markets, the price was almost one-third.This time, there has been a bumper production, especially in the last leg of the harvest. This is probably the reason for falling prices, said Ranjeet Kumar, a vegetable retailer.Read |After crop failure, Vidarbha farmers in Maharashtra crippled by note ban"

We are fighting to make our country economically independent and freedom from multi-national companies by promoting indigenous and natural products, he claimed. He also said that it would bail out the crisis-ridden farm sector of Vidarbha that is infamous for farmer suicides.The company plans to develop a modern food park by building a Rs 1000-crore plant, and manufacture juice made from the famous Nagpuri orange. This would be the first time that orange juice made from local fruit would be packaged as a brand, the yoga guru said.Union minister Gadkari, who has been instrumental in getting Ramdev to invest in food parks and allied business in the region, claimed that the yoga gurus company Patanjali would be a boon for the farmers of the region and it would usher in modernization of the Nagpur city.According to him, tribals from Gadchiroli, Gondia and Chandrapur who make a living collecting forest produces, like medicinal plants and herbs would benefit hugely from this initiative.Farmers will be trained by Patanjali workers to grow orange, aloe vera, tomato and herbs according to the specification of the company and given a purchase guarantee. A team of scientists and other experts are also working on the project that is expected to change the farm economy of the region.Speaking on the occasion, the chief minister, Fadnavis dismissed the allegations levelled by the former Union minister, Vilas Muttemwar that the government has given the plot of land to Patanjali at less than half of the cost that other investors have paid at MIHAN.The process involved at giving the land to Patanjali was transparent. We had floated tenders thrice and Patanjali Ayurveda was found to be the right choice in the bidding as per the central vigilance commission norms, Fadnavis said.The government wanted a commitment to procure raw materials to the tune of at least Rs 100 crore per annum from the farmers and members of tribal community within the surrounding area.It also laid a condition that the bidder should commit to train minimum 2,000 farmers per year across Maharashtra to improve productivity, quality and market intelligence to get them ready for agro business development in consultation with agriculture department. Patanjali has assured to fulfill all these norms, the chief minister said. The plant is expected to link nearly 50,000 farmers suppliers, create direct employment for over 10,000 people and eventually provide indirect employment to lakhs of families.Regarding the land deal, senior Congress leader Muttemwar had said that as against the running rate of Rs 60-lakh per acre, Patanjali has been charged only Rs 25-lakh an acre. He said that this deal was against all norms and hence should be probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) as the state-run MIHAN had acquired land from farmers and was giving it on a platter to Patanjali as a special favour.Muttemwar alleged that the deal was nothing but the BJP government was repaying a favour to Ramdev who had campaigned wholeheartedly for the party during the 2014 general elections."

The prices may get stable only after 20 days, they said.The wholesale price of tomato was Rs 15-20 per kg in Chandigarh nearly a week ago which has now gone up to Rs 30-40 per kg. The retail price has increased from Rs 30-40 per kg to Rs 50-60 per kg.Tomatoes have hit the budget of low-income and middle-class families, especially when keeping the fact in mind the commodity is a common ingredient.I cannot cook any vegetable without tomato as it is the most commonly used ingredient. If the rates continue to rise, I will start using tomato puree, said Sangeeta Kansal, a homemaker from Sector 27. Hina Garg, another city resident, said, I used to buy 5-6 kg tomato every month but now I have to manage with just 3-4 kg.The price of cauliflower has increased from Rs 30- 40 per kg in the past 15 days and it is likely to further increase to Rs 50. The price of garlic has increased from Rs 80 to Rs 140 per kg and of capsicum from Rs 40 to Rs 80 per kg.Digvijay Kapoor, president, Sabzi Mandi Arhtiya Association, said, The prices of vegetables increase around this time every year. High temperatures during April and May in Punjab and heavy rain in Himachal Pradesh have hit the production of tomato and other vegetables.It is not only vegetables, but the prices of pulses have also gone up. The price of chana dal has shot up from Rs 73 per kg to Rs 83 per kg in a week."

The poster reads: Thug ki sarkar (crooks government). Below, the punchline reads: Kaho dil se, Akhilesh fir se, urging the masses to vote the Samajwadi Party back to power in Uttar Pradesh.Interestingly, like the BJP earlier, the Samajwadi Party leaders have also distanced themselves from these posters.This might be a reaction from the masses to the earlier posters by BJP which were an insensitive depiction of an unfortunate incident at Jawahar Bagh. We do not indulge in such politics, said Vipul Purohit, in charge of Samajwadi Party in Agra.On Friday, posters bearing the BJPs lotus targetted the Samajwadi Party government for the violence in Mathuras Jawahar Bagh.State leaders of the saffron party had distanced themselves from the posters."

But Agarwal said the official policy was misrepresented.The newspaper report said the administration in its policy Controlling of Places of Public Amusement, 2016 said permission could be denied to discothque owners to run their business if a Union Territory committee found exhibition or advertisement of scantily dressed women and indecency or if it was seditious and likely to excite political discontent. The policy came into effect on April 1.The policy draft, however, does not define scantily dressed women or indecency and also doesnt elaborate on sedition, the newspaper article read.The report sparked furore on Twitter and Facebook.Babus in Centre ruled Chandigarh will now decide which skirt is fit for city's women when they go to a disco or pub.
