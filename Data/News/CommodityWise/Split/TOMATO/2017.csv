Its good to dump our crop on the road, he said.While some farmers blamed it on demonetisation and cash crunch, Shajapur mandi secretary Rajesh Mishra dismissed the allegations, saying high supply and low demand had caused the prices to fall.The Madhya Pradesh government had announced facilities such as cash vans and transport subsidy for farmers to face cash crunch, but farmers claimed they are yet to receive them.According to sources, the daily supply of tomatoes at Shajapur mandi is around 200 to 300 crates as many farmers are sending their crop directly to Bhopal and Indore markets.They claimed that the rates were decent at Indore and Bhopal mandis."

It had also planned transport subsidy for vegetable growers.However, when HT visited Laxmibai Nagar and Choithram mandisthe largest in the regionthe promised facilities were not available.People buying vegetables at Choithram sabji mandi on Monday. (Shankar Mourya/HT photo)Farmers were getting poor prices for a range of vegetables and in some cases, such as green peas and tomatoes, they were not getting enough to even cover the input costs.Our condition has gone from bad to worse due to cash crunch and demonetisation. Today (on Monday) we are getting Rs 50-60 for a crate (25 kg) of tomatoes. That will barely cover the transport, hammali (porter) and mandi charges, said Hukumchand Makwana, a farmer from Piplu village, about 70 km from Indore.We have to pay labourers and also need money for paying interest on debt besides running our households. So we have no option but to sell our produce at low rates, said farmer Shantilal Chawra who has been staying at the mandi premises for past three days to sell his green peas, whose prices have come down to Rs 5 per kg, less than the input costs.The demand-supply equation has also turned against the farmers as production of seasonal vegetables has increased whereas people have tightened their purses.When asked about the support provided by the mandi administration after demonetisation, commission agent Ashok Bhilware said they have been left to fend for themselves.Commission agents act as a link between farmers and wholesale traders to keep the vegetable supply chain running and often lend money to farmers.Small farmers need cash for their daily requirements. Nowadays, there is liquidity crisis but farmers supplying vegetable do not accept cheques, he said.Officials told HT that no directive to provide special facilities to vegetable farmers has come from Bhopal.We have not received any such directive (to talk to the banks about providing cash vans or give transport subsidy) so far from the state government, Praveen Verma, deputy director, MP State Agricultural Marketing Board, Indore region, said.Choithram mandi in-charge B B S Tomar could not be reached for comment despite visit to his office, repeated calls and text messages.WOES MOUNTPrices of potatoes, onions, and seasonal vegetables including tomatoes and green peas have crashed.Transportation costs are increasing due to rise in fuel costs. On top of that farmers have to pay to hammals (porters) and also pay mandi charges. So in some cases, they have been unable to recover even the input costs.Facilities announced by the government including cash vans and transport subsidy have not been implemented"

The village has a population of 320 people and they are dependent only on agriculture.Villagers complain that in the past one decade or so, attacks by monkeys and wild boars in their agriculture land have made things difficult. We keep guarding fields from monkeys during day and from wild boars during night, said Negi.Farming in hills is shrinking fast and farmers losing interest in it. Besides attacks by monkeys and wild boars, farmers facing problem due to lack of irrigation facility. Farming in hills is rain fed and canals are limited to some pockets.In Doon Dwara, villagers have either stopped or growing limited crops like millets, oats, vegetables like cucumber, tomatoes, potatoes etc.Shyam Singh, another farmer, said monkeys destroy vegetables while wild boars destroy potato fields. We are left with very little options, Singh said.Farming in hills has become a non-profitable entity. Government figure shows that agriculture land came down from 7.91 lakh hectares in 2009-10 to 7.41 lakh in 2011-12.Half of the states agricultural land falls in four districts of Dehradun, Nainital, Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar in plains and rest is shared by nine hill districts.Prakash Dimri, another farmer, said: 2,200 is the average cost that comes on sowing in an area of 0.02 hectares or 1 nali while the return is not more than 1,500.The land holdings are tiny and which are getting further fragmented over time. 87% farming in hills is rain fed while only 13% has irrigation facility, said Vijay Jardhari, an agro expert.Change in the climate pattern is also a big concern, rain cycle is no more regular thus farmers are left with little choice, he said.Jardhari said farmers must continue with millets since it survives drought like condition and give handsome returns. He, however, is clueless on providing solutions to farmers who were not growing millets owing to threat from wild animals.Due to growing population of monkeys, acres of arable land left untilled and agriculture activities have almost reduced to vicinity of houses in the villages.Villagers in Thano in the outskirts of Dehradun are trying to grow crops such as ginger, turmeric, bitter gourd and lady finger that usually monkeys dont eat.People in Balori village that falls in Pauri district have passed a resolution asking the district administration to either drive away monkeys or vasectomise them.The forest department is entrusted with the task of catching monkeys but it is confined to urban areas. In February 2016, the department gave permission with riders to kill the wild boars affecting farming in hills.Killing wild boars is not an easy task. In the absence of trained hunters, the order is meaningless said Ratan Aswal of village Mirchoda."

Trap them.""In one protest last month, dozens of taxi drivers posed as would-be passengers, flooding the app with requests before forcing the Uber drivers from their vehicles, much to the bemusement of onlookers.The management of taxis in Morocco normally falls to local government. The transport ministry has so far kept quiet as to why Uber continues to operate in the streets of Casablanca.- 'Illegal and unauthorised' -""Our position hasn't changed,"" a senior official from Casablanca's local administration told AFP. ""We see (Uber) as an unauthorised and illegal company.""Local media said recently that as many as 30 separate protests against app drivers had been held, ranging from threats, car chases and even ambushes such as the one in DecemberUber Morocco director general Meryem Belqziz insisted these were ""isolated"" incidents.""There were no injuries. It was more harassment,"" she told AFP, admitting however that Uber drivers had been ""shaken"" by some protests.There are now more than 250 taxis working for Uber in Casablanca, Belqziz said, and the app has enjoyed 15,000 unique users in the last three months.Business has boomed for Uber since it launched in San Francisco in 2011.But the smartphone app has faced stiff resistance from traditional taxi drivers the world over, as well as bans in some places over safety concerns and questions over legal issues, including taxes.Uber says it is not a transport company like taxi firms, and that it simply connects drivers with passengers.While many drivers have been tempted by Uber's model, many more operators of Casablanca's estimated 18,000 taxis continue to denounce the app's ""unfair competition"", while passengers still heavily rely instead on local ride startups such as Careem and chauffeur.ma.The recent opening of a new tram line in the city has also siphoned off some of the local drivers' traditional clientele.""The tram has already eaten up an important part of our market, and things are getting worse with Uber, which operates without constraint,"" said Abdelouahed.Belqziz insists that Uber and local taxis can operate side-by-side, but admits her firm's legal status ""needs clarifying"".""With every important change you meet resistance, but with time people get used to new modes of consumption,"" she said."

(PTI File Photo) NCP president Sharad Pawar. (PTI File Photo)NCP President Sharad Pawar on Thursday described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a smooth talker while taunting him over the note ban decision and wondered if he would now go after the gold ornaments worn by people. The former Defence Minister took potshots at Modi and highlighted the problems faced by common people following his decision to scrap the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes.WATCH VIDEO | President Pranab Mukherjee Warns Modi Government Regarding DemonetisationPeople told me: The next step (after demonetisation) is that the Government will check the gold ornaments we are wearing. This is how things are now. That means this is our last term as Parliament members. People will never elect us again, he said at a rally in Pimpalgaon near here.People told me: You speak to him (Modi) about the problems caused by demonetisation as you have good relations with him. They said when Modi came to an event in Pune, he praised me, saying it was I who guided him in politics, Pawar said.I said, this is it. I brought him into politics. He (Modi) is a smooth talker. He speaks in such a powerful manner that the person hearing him believes there is something to the manthat he must be having a 56-inch chest, he said.The Maratha strongman noted that BJPs own ally Shiv Sena had opposed the currency scrap exercise and it should now decide what punishment should be given to the PM for the failed drive.Modi said give him 50 days and (if demonetisation didnt succeed, he was willing to bear any punishment people gave him. Shiv Sena is their ally. I read (Sena chief) Uddhav Thackerays speech where he said in which public square should Modi be made to stand (to accept punishment), he said.The former Agriculture Minister said people are bearing the brunt of the note ban exercise which has caused collapse of remunerative prices for vegetable growers.The promised 50 days are over. Prices of all items have collapsed, be it onions or tomatoes. I had two acres of brinjal crop in my farm. A fortnight ago, I went home and asked my associate who handles the farm work about the earnings from the brinjal crop.When he gave me the receipt, I said it shows even the transportation cost was not recovered. If this is the plight of a person like me, what will be your situation? wondered the veteran Parliamentarian.Modi had heaped praises on the NCP chief at an event in Pune in November where he was invited by Pawar. I have personal respect for Sharadrao. He helped me walk in politics by holding my finger. I feel proud to pronounce this publicly, the PM had stated.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(K Giri Babu | EPS)Rucksack on my back I stepped down at the Tirupati railway station early one morning last week, and found that something was amiss. I ought to have heard the passenger ahead of me, peaceable until now, break out into a full-throated Govinda, Govinda! slogan by now. At this time of the year, the station is normally packed with devotees either going to the Venkateshwara temple on Tirumala hill or returning from from there. But the platform was sparse with the odd peasant family from the interiors lolling on a bedroll on the bare floor and bleary-eyed returnees picking up their luggage and briskly making for exits. Even the man at the kiosk outside the station yodeling to passengers to buy bus tickets to Tirumala was not being very successful. Was this the demonetisation effect, I wondered.After refreshments, I drove out of town into Rayalaseema's parched hinterland of hillocks and precarious rock formations that threaten drama but never deliver. Rayalaseema lends itself to both cynics and poets. The former call it Rallaseema (country of rocks) and latter Ratanalaseema (country of rubies). The cynics are winning right now. A timeless drought has taken grip of this region, enveloping everyone, businessmen, small-time traders, farmers, students, poets, cynics, in an indolent stupor.I first stopped at Srinivasa Mangapuram, which lies on one of the two routes taken by trekkers to reach the big temple on Tirumala. This town too is sacred, having its own temple to the same god, but presented as the Kalyana Venkateswara. Hymns recited by priests in the temple wrapped the area in a spiritual aura. The first man I met said he was a tailor from Keelapatla, a village 75 km in the interior. He and his family had walked the distance to go to the Tirumala temple and decided to do the mandatory Srinivasa Mangapuram detour. He said he wasnt happy. I have had no business in the past two months, Prakash said. We are going to Tirumala to pray so that we may have something to live for. My family needs at least Rs 200 per day. Im not making even that. As proof of his determination, Prakash showed me the blisters on the soles of his feet. They had been trekking for two days with a four-hour break at Kanipakam, another holy stopover on the Tirumala pilgrim circuit.I stepped over to a juicers stall to see if he had it any better. B Guravaiah repeated to me the tailors story in much the same manner, doleful but hopeful at the same time. I am not making even Rs. 200 a day, said the vendor. The devotees are coming but no one comes to me for a drink.I continued my journey along the ghat road skirting the Seshachlam forests, home to rare red sanders woods and smugglers of the wood and hunters of the smugglers. In 2016, the troika made for a dysfunctional ecosystem that kept journalists like me busy reporting their skirmishes but now as 2017 beckoned, the forest was an inviting diversion. The scene from the window of my taxi was sylvan and the green canopy seemed to awn over all the difficulties of the past two months.When soon the woods parted company with me, I decided to break at Bhakrapet and walked over to a group of youngsters on bikes who had stopped by the roadside. They were students of Sri Venkateswara Ayurvedic College in Tirupati. They were on their way to Talakona to see the waterfall there. How had the past year been?It was good. In fact, very good. My sister and my brother got married in May and August. And Ill get married in 2017, said one of the happy boys.Does he love her? Oh no, my parents settled the match. I believe in arranged marriage, he said, breaking out in titters.He said his name was Balakrishna and his home was Mahbubnagar, Telangana. He is studying for an MD degree in ayurvedic medicine and his hope for 2017 was to set up a practice in his native town.Another of the bikers, Dr Chakaradhar, said he was looking forward to his wedding too, next year. Im engaged. And after marriage I will set up a clinic at home in Kadapa, he said.A few miles out of Bhakrapet, I was back in the droughtscape of Rayalaseema with the happy conversation with the bikers still on my mind. At Kalagada on the Kadapa-Chittoor border, I stopped to eavesdrop on a roadside argument. It was a farmer cursing strangers passing by. After the assembly had dispersed, I asked him his name. Riaz Ali Khan was a tomato farmer. He said he had lost seven lakh rupees on his last crop. I sowed three acres. Last year I sold for Rs 500 per box. Now they are offering me Rs 30 per box. Id rather let the fruit rot on the plants. I wont throw them on the road because I have respect for tomatoes, he said to me, still indignant.If it is your livelihood, you should respect the crop, right?Back on my route, the Veligalla reservoir suddenly appeared on the horizon and I looked for a tinge of green in the landscape around me. The land was barren. I stopped to talk to a farmer on a farm adjacent to the canal. He was working a kerosene-fuelled pump to irrigate his eight-acre groundnut crop. Im quite happy, he said to my surprise. Last year was fine. And the new year promises to be good too.How had demonetisation affected him? He managed, he said. I have a problem in getting small notes to pay my labourers, though. If I get good crop, Ill get a good price. I invested Rs 40,000 per acre and I should easily get Rs 80,000.He had a vermilion teeka on his forehead, so I asked him about Narendra Modi. If he waives crop loans, it will be good. he said.I moved on to Kadiri in Anantapur, Andhra Pradeshs drought district, as dusk descended. The town was dusty and the lights had not come on in the shops. I stopped to ask a watch repairer if there was a power cut. There is supply, sir. But traders are not switching on the lights because there is no business for them, the man said.His name was Zebi and he wanted to talk. Show me one shop with any customers. Look at my shop. Its only 5.30 and I am getting ready to close. Everyone wants to save money on power.Kadiri, in his telling, was a cursed town: no industries, no rains and no crops. We get drinking water for one hour once in three to four days and it has very high flouride content. If they dont do something, this town will die, Zebi declared.I then ducked into a basket weavers shop on the main street of Kadiri. Eshwaraiah did not have great expectations for the new year either. Bamboo baskets are on the way out. People are buying plastic baskets and tubs. Many basket weavers have moved to Bangalore to work as labourers."

The trend that started after Onam is expected to continue until March if not for any unexpected natural event.Of the 23 items under the tubers and vegetables category in the ESD list, 17 have lower prices than previous January with some like carrot and tomato showing over 40 per cent dip. Exceptions are elephant foot yam, tapioca, colocasia, cucumber, banana and plantain which recorded 4-56 per cent hike in prices.While the milk price is stable, a dozen white leghorn eggs now cost Rs 1.40 less. V P Jayakumar, a vegetable trader in Chalai market and a former office-bearer of the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi, said now there was a surplus supply of vegetables from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, unlike previous years.Prices are down after Onam and the situation is likely to continue until March, he said.Cereal is one category that survived the downfall trend and firmed up. Except Chamba rice, all other rice varieties showed an upward trend, 7-18 per cent growth from previous January. Sugar too recorded a 23 per cent growth. According to Satheesh R N, Supplycos marketing manager, the new governments decision to sell 13 commodities at the same rate during its tenure has helped control the prices of major cereals and pulses.The 1,400-odd outlets of Supplyco help our consumerist state to control food prices. Commodities other than the 13 classified items are sold at prices 40-50 per cent less than the market rate. FMCGs are sold at 2-30 per cent discount, he added."

A lot of problems in the agriculture sector are due to floods and droughts caused by climate change, Swaminathan said, adding focus should also be on providing convenient loans to women farmers to encourage participation.Right to Food campaigner Dipa Sinha dubbed the Budget a continuation of disappointments, especially for women and child welfare. There is focus on maternity benefit, which is good, but the funds allocated for it will not be sufficient for its universal applicability, she said. She was surprised that the finance minister chose to give malnutrition a pass, particularly after it was sharply brought to focus recently with several tragic deaths in Maharashtra."

Students are given lectures thrice a week on how to maintain the garden by urban farming groups like Start Upcycling Now (SUN) and iKheti, which helped the school to set up the garden.The project started in July 2016 after Father Gregory, the schools manager, roped in 240 students of Class 8 and explained the idea. Fascinated by the idea of having their own garden, the students immediately swung into action. Each class is divided into four sections and each division was assigned four gardens each.In a concrete jungle like Mumbai, a terrace garden awakens a sense of environmental consciousness and becomes a forum for knowledge. It also provides a variety of organic and fresh vegetables right at your doorstep, said Father Gregory.He added that a special period has been dedicated for the students to do the gardening work, which includes watering the plants, planting new vegetables, adding soil and compost or removing saplings, everything is done in the Work Experience period once a week.To execute the project, students created soil beds using clay bricks. A plastic sheet was spread on the brick base to prevent water from seeping through. Later, seven inch thick soil layer is spread on the plastic and is mixed with mulch comprising shredded cardboard and dry leaves. This helps soil to retain moisture even on the hot days.We should not just teach students phrases, but also make them apply those in real life. This is their real education. Now, they are so involved in it that they even utilise their recess time nurturing the plants, said Gracy Solomon, principal, OLPS.StudentspeakCommenting on the initiative, Razeen Sayyed, 13, said, We (each division) get 30 minutes with our respective gardens during which we must ensure that everything is fine with the crop. If everything is okay, and we are left with some time, we make self-irrigation bottles.The terrace garden produces brinjals, tomatoes, ladies fingers (okra), lemon grass, lemons and carom seeds (ajwain), which is appreciated not only by their treachers but also the monkeys who visit the garden in search of fresh vegetables.Monkeys eat our entire tomato crop. So to keep them at bay, we installed a scare crow, said Aaradhya Patil, 13.On each patch of garden, there are boards with information on the plants and their uses. For example, pentas plant is used as a popular medicine in malaria and lime to relieve asthma.Kids should understand how the plants are grown from scratch and that even a day of not watering can take away all their hard work, said Priyanka Shah, founder, iKheti, adding In this way, they also learn to respect food and become sensitive towards the environment.Organic fertilisersThe compost that they use in the garden comes from the waste created in the school campus. The school has eight drums in a set of four for each division where they dump organic waste, which is later used as fertiliser.Students do all the legwork they can for the environment. Aerobic composting is something that you just have to dump it and almost everything else is taken care of the microorganisms. The students of the school make sure that no waste goes out to the dump yard from the school, said Natasha DCosta, SUN founder.After the crop comes to fruition, the saplings are handed over to the students. Sanket Gauri, a student of Class VIII, said, We showed it to our parents and friends, and now even they want to be a part of it. My neighbours liked it so much that they want to start gardening on our terrace as well.The students are not just young environmentalists, but they are exceptional in studies as well. They recently won a Science Club Competition last year.My favourite subject is Maths, but this [terrace gardening] is Science, Chemistry, Geography and all other subjects put to practice, said Essakkimuthu Konar, 14, as he held his self-irrigation bottle with his name labelled on it.Also read: Teen powers change, helps buildings, schools recycle 350 kg of batteries"

Photos: P.K. Badiger and SANTOSH SAGAR: Farmers of two districts marked the new year in an unusual manner. Utter frustration and helplessness drove cabbage growers of some villages in Belagavi district to feed their fresh crop to cattle, while tomato growers in Raichur distributed the produce for free.The crash in prices is being attributed to a glut in the harvest as well as the shortage of cash caused by demonetisation. This has resulted in traders refusing procurement, or quoting low prices.The price of cabbage crashed to Rs. 1 to Rs. 1.2 a kg in some of the wholesale markets in Belagavi district whereas in November, it was selling at Rs. 700 to Rs. 800 a quintal.Tomato growers in Raichur are also in dire straits. When a few farmers brought their produce to the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee yard in Raichur, commission agents and traders refused to offer them more than Rs. 1 a kg. Helpless, they began giving away nearly six quintals of tomatoes for free in the Teenkandil locality of the city.Such a low price does not even meet the cost of cultivation, let alone transportation expenses, said a farmer. There is no point in taking the produce back home as not only is tomato a perishable commodity, it will also incur more transportation charges.A bountiful yield has hardly brought cheer to these farmers. Lakshmanagowda Kadgamdoddi, district president of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, alleged that the price crash was a strategy of APMC traders and commission agents, who purchase from tomato growers in other regions and States on credit.

The farmers say that traders were unwilling to buy because exports to Pakistan have stopped.""Exporters usually came in large numbers. But this year only a few showed up,"" said Ramesh Patel a trader from Kalyanpur. ""These are traders from Delhi, Haryana, and Punjab. Earlier, two trucks were loaded for Delhi, Punjab, and Pakistan daily, but this year only one truck is loaded every two days for Haryana and Punjab.""Interestingly, while farmers were finding it difficult to sell their produce even at Re 1 per kg, the wholesale price in the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), Ahmedabad, |ranged between Rs 2 and Rs 5 per kg. However, the retail price ranged between Rs 10 and Rs 20 per kg.Patel said that farmers of the area want the government to come forward and purchase the produce at about Rs 4 per kg so that farmers are able to get the basic cost if not profit. Patel said that on Tuesday no fewer than 20 tractors had come to sell their produce but traders, locally known as kantawalas, were not willing to buy. Rajesh Patel, another farmer from the area, said, ""Following tension on the border, purchase by traders has halved. Earlier, we were not willing to sell tomatoes to Pakistan, but now we hope that tension eases and we get some money."" Kaushik Patel, also a farmer from the area, said: ""The situation was so bad that farmers are now replacing their tomato crops with bajri."" Patel said that in his 7 bigah of land he gets around 6,000 kg per bigah of tomato. This year the crop was good compared to the previous years, he said."

Satyanarayana, medical officer attached to the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Fluorosis (NPPCF).Dental fluorosis and skeletal fluorosis are common in the western parts of the district, as the groundwater in over 1,100 villages has high fluoride content. So is the incidence of fluoride-induced CKD, especially in the mandals of Kangiri, P.C. Palli, Chandrasekarapuram and Pamur, where fluoride contamination is above 5 parts per million (ppm), he said in a conversation with The Hindu .The problem is severe in the villages of Bommireddipalle, Vengalayapalli, Neredepalli, Peddagogulapalle, Vaggampalle, Bandlamudi, Naidupalem, Lakshmipuram, Manchikalapadu, Bodavada, Narsapuram, Dharmavaram, Rajupalem and Balijapalem. Even in these villages, it is the vulnerable section of people who are suffering from CKD, while those taking a nutritious diet and without blood pressure and diabetes are not affected. Diet rich in calcium and magnesium like milk, leafy green vegetables, carrot, radish, raisins, peaches, apricots and dates and tomatoes can make a difference as it helps excrete fluoride through urine and bowel movement, he explains. According to the data available with the district officials, 345 people died of CKD since January 2015, while over 2,000 patients with white ration cards are undergoing treatment under NTR Aarogyasri in different hospitals.Fluoride toxicity increases following malfunctioning of the kidneys causing further damage to the kidneys, bones and other organs, explains Machiraju Ramachandra Rao, Resident Medical Officer at Sanghamitra hospital.Five per cent of the patients need dialysis and their lifespan can be increased by five to six years on an average, adds S. Sridhar Reddy, consultant nephrologist at the hospital.Drinking surface water is advised in view of contamination of groundwater with different types of minerals, says K. Krishnarjuna Rao, Medical Officer at the dailysis centre at the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences(RIMS), where 140 patients undergo dialysis twice a week.Lone demandA dialysis centre at Kanigiri is our only demand, says Sk. Mastan from Kangiri, while undergoing haemodialysis at the RIMS here.Visiting Ongole twice in a week along with an attendant means an additional expense of at least Rs. 4,000 per month for me, adds another patient M.

Cattle were also being fed with cauliflower, coriander leaves and brinjal among others on Saturday. A bumper production has led to the situation where the rates of vegetables especially tomato have nosedived. The perishable commodity in abundance was sold at Rs 10 a crate containing 10 kg in Bina, said Sunderlal Patel a farmer.""The middlemen or adhatiya in local language has been exploiting the farmers who has not been able to pay the transport charges to ferry the produce from farmlands to mandi,"" he said. He said the middlemen were also making small payments of Rs 100 by cheque. Patel said, it is better to feed the cattle with the fresh vegetables rather than sell it at throw away polices. In return, they may give more milk.Farmers would load tractor trollies and unload the produce before the cattle at home. Some villagers take them away for their cattle as well, said another farmer Babloo Kushwah, resident of Khimlasa village, 18 kms away from Bina. He said, ""I had spent Rs 25,000 on seeds, manures and maintenance of the crop to ensure a good crop. I did not expect such a low price, which does not even meet the cost of cultivation, let alone transportation expenses""In Ashoknagar, situation is even worse.

This ground reality appears to contradict the optimism expressed by the finance minister that increased sowing this year was an indicator of farmers' ""support"" for demonetisation.In Aligarh, Mathura and Agra, normal wheat sowing is done in the first fortnight of November. Because of the sudden note ban , it was delayed by 15-20 days, said farmers at Managarhi village in Mathura district. ""We used stored grain for sowing since there was no cash for buying. Other expenses are pending. Now the worry is, how to water this crop and arrange for fertilisers?"" said Raj Kumar, who has sown about five acres.The same worry haunts farmers in Etawah and Auraiya, although their normal sowing time is in the first week of December. Sadan Kumar from Ekghara village in Etawah has also used stored grain as seed and plans to use less fertilizer. Irrigation is a bigger concern because mostly pumps are used and this requires cash for diesel. For those who don't own a pumpset, buying water is a major expense at Rs 4,500 per acre, said Kundan Singh in Mathura.That the rabi crop is not getting required inputs of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides or fungicides is confirmed by traders. Sanjeev Yadav in Saifai and Ram Khilona Mishra in Bakewar are vendors of agri inputs. They told TOI that ""sales were down 30- 40%"" despite them offering some credit facilities.From Mathura in the west to Auraiya in central UP, growers of cauliflower, brinjal, potato, chillies, tomatoes, etc told TOI that vegetables sold for one fourth to one tenth of expected prices after note ban.""We have never seen such a time,"" said 80-year old Saudan Singh from Mitholi village in Mathura who sold his brinjal harvest for just 80p per kg and tomatoes for Rs 3 per kg in November.In Ankodia village in Etawah, Anoop Kumar said that cauliflower went for just Rs 5 per kg while potatoes dropped to Rs 2-3 per kg. While the kharif harvest of paddy and pulses like arhar was sold for lower prices in mandis, transactions were mostly done in the old notes till December end.As long as petrol pumps were allowed to accept the old notes, farmers would use payments from wholesale traders to buy diesel, said a trader in Etawah.But across the Chambal river near Etawah, in Bhind, MP, where the main crops are less water-requiring bajra, moong, urad and til, the mandi wears a haunted look as farmers are not selling their produce because they don't want to be paid in cheques. E-transactions are virtually absent.Says Akhtar Khan of Khanpur village in Auraiya, ""I haven't sown my four bighas. It is located near a forest area and requires a lot of care. Where will Iget the cash for all that?"""

While the district had set a target for including 20,000 farmers under the Indo-Israeli agro project, it received 60,000 applications.But things were not as rosy when the system was introduced with many farmers being apprehensive in adopting the method. ``Now, many have come forward to take it up'', said K Srinivasan, project officer for Centre for Excellence for Vegetables, Reddiarchathiram. As of now, there are about 30 farmers who had plumped for the method in the district.Polyhouse cultivation is a protected cultivation where the crops are safeguarded against natural influences like too much sunlight, rain or drought. The major water source for polyhouse or green house cultivation is micro drip irrigation, which ensures that the plants get adequate water.The farmers have to invest approximately Rs 10 lakh for a quarter acre, but they can get back the invested money in just two years as far as the hybrid variety of cucumber is concerned, according to Srinivasan. They initially started the cultivation with tomatoes and moved on to cucumber which is being cultivated in large areas.G Kathirvel Murugan from Kalikampatti panchayat in Dindigul has now started cultivating chrysanthemums in polyhouses and started seeing good returns. The ones that he planted in July have now started flowering. He had invested Rs 30,000 on the plants and Rs 44,000 on setting up the polyhouse. Compared to those grown under open cultivation which start fading from the third day onwards, flowers under protected cultivation have thicker petals and remain fresh even for five to ten days.On an average, plants on 1,000 square feet yield about 80 kilogram during peak season and sell at Rs 100 per kilogram. Srinivasan said that a farmer could earn about Rs 7,000 per day and quality chrysanthemums for two years.Hybrid cucumbers with a 130-day cycle would yield 20 tonnes per acre and the fruits would be ready for harvesting 35 days after sowing. A farmer can make a profit of up to Rs 25 lakh per acre in a season with the vegetable selling for Rs 22 per kilogram. A farmer in Bodikamanvadi near Battalagundu has reaped 27 tonnes per quarter acre in the last season, creating a record of sorts. A polyhouse once constructed can be used for twenty years, according to him.Polyhouse Versus Open field farmingPolyhouse - Open field1.Crops protected from natural weather - They are exposed to nature and conditions like excess sunlight and rain2.Drip irrigation enables water supply - Drought can lead to water scarcity3.They are protected from pests - Can be affected by pests4.Crops produce 60 % more yield than under open conditions5.Suitable for hybrid varieties - All traditional varieties are cultivated this way6.Assured returns - Returns depend on climatic conditions."
58e532c37be9e05a951f57d1,Glut and cash crunch spawn a tomato torment,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1170107/jsp/nation/story_129016.jsp,2017-01-07,,Telegraph,"Nagpur, Jan. 6: The monsoon was good this year, the climate perfect and the yield bumper. Sandeep Thavkar, 28, thought his tomatoes would fetch a tidy sum. Used to growing the traditional soybean or cotton, he had gambled on tomatoes on an acre and a half of his four-acre farmland after seeing the crop fetch better returns for his neighbours in Virkhandi, 65km from Nagpur, last year. But the prices crashed even before he had begun harvesting his tomatoes, a local variety, in mid-December. Last week, 25 crates of his tomatoes, each with 25kg of the vegetable, fetched just Re 1.20 a kg. At that price, he said, he could not recover even the labour charges, let alone the cost of transport and carting and the market agent's commission. Not to mention his input costs and family labour. After returning home on December 27, Sandeep borrowed his cousin Sachin's tractor. He drove it over his standing tomato crop on which he had toiled round the clock with his wife, an elder sister and an aunt for four months: planting, weeding, watering, standing guard against pests. He did it partly in despair and partly to cut his losses. ""Tomatoes are harvested till March. I have already spent Rs 50,000 and needed to spend another Rs 20,000 on pesticides and labour to maintain the rest of the crop,"" Sandeep said. ""That would have meant more losses. I could see the prices won't rise. I'd rather gamble on another crop today and harvest it by March-April to make up some of my losses,"" he said. Sandeep, who says a price of Rs 10 a kg would have merely helped him break even, insists the prices began tumbling after the November 8 note recall announcement. But local traders in Bhiwapur and Umred towns, 20km on either side of Virkhandi village, wouldn't blame the demonetisation entirely. ""A bumper crop resulted in the price crash,"" Banti Chakole, 38, said at Umred mandi. ""Vegetable prices do fall in November-December-January every year, and this year tomatoes are in abundance."" But he conceded that the prices nose-dived after November 8. ""I have to say I have never seen the situation this bad in my 20-year career."" ""Vegetable prices go down around this time of the year because of seasonality but perhaps cash shortage has been an additional factor,"" wrote Dr Ashok Kumar Lahiri, former chief economic adviser to the Indian government, in a recent paper on demonetisation, part of a series published by the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy. Data from Nagpur's agriculture produce market committee show a sharp difference in prices before and after the demonetisation. Before November 8, Bandu Ghormade of Chicholi, 50km from Nagpur, sold his tomatoes at Rs 8 a kg - a little low, perhaps because of the glut. Yesterday the price stood at Re 1 a kg. In 2015, tomato prices in December-January averaged Rs 15 a kg for the desi variety and Rs 37.5 for the export (hybrid) variety. But between November 1 and December 25 last year, the hybrid prices fell from an average Rs 29 a kg to Rs 5.50 a kg in 29 big markets across India, the National Horticulture Board's data show. In Raipur, hybrid tomato prices fell to Rs 4 a kg. The desi variety sold at 50 paise a kg in Chhattisgarh's Jashpur district, prompting farmers to dump several tonnes of tomatoes on highways in frustration. In Wardha town, 80km from Nagpur, farmer Pramon Ranit parked his tempo in the middle of a busy square on December 27 and gave away 400 kg of his tomatoes free in four hours. The nine-acre farmer had grown tomatoes over three acres, expecting to double his Rs 1 lakh investment. But when the traders offered Re 1 per kg, he decided to earn goodwill through charity instead. On January 2, news agency ANI reported that a group of farmers, members of the Yuva Pragatisheel Kisan Sangh, gave away about one lakh kilograms of vegetables, including tomatoes, free in Raipur in protest against the demonetisation. In Virkhandi, Sandeep is wondering what to plant on his forlorn patch, freshly flattened with a tractor. Should it be the guar (a kind of bean), the Indian round gourd (tinda in Hindi) or okra? Whatever it is, what's the guarantee it will fetch a profit? ""I'll need to check the market prices and take a gamble,"" he smiles wanly."

But in the past, Blumhouse Productions (founded by Jason Blum) has given us great scares in the form of horror series like Paranormal Activity , Insidious and The Purge . In fact, the company is responsible for The Hush , a 2016 horror thriller film that has an impressive 100 per cent holding on Rotten Tomatoes. Unfortunately, the company has hit a speed-bump by the name of Incarnate , perhaps the least scary possession film to ever grace a big screen.Wheelchair-bound Seth Embers (a thoroughly wasted albeit sincere Aaron Eckhart) can enter the subconscious minds of victims possessed by evil spirits. Hes handicapped after a car accident  caused by an inexplicably vindictive demon  that killed his wife and son. For years, hes been hunting Maggie as the evil entity has come to be known. Now shes taken a young boy hostage  one that looks eerily similar to his own deceased son  and Embers must evict the spirit from the boy. Theres also the Vatican involved in the form of a supremely attractive papal agent Camilla (Catalina Sandino Moreno), an unnecessary addition among many. Oh, and Lindsay, the possessed boys mother is played by Game of Throne s Carice van Houten. She so stoic, she barely tears up after witnessing the death of her estranged husband.To say Incarnate is derived is an understatement; there have been countless films with demon possessions. This writer didnt sleep for days after watching The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005). Yet, slumber was oh so sound after Incarnate , in fact perhaps even induced by the film. Lets spell it out in case there was any doubt: this film is a crashing bore.Why Eckhart would deign to waste his talent after films like Thank You for Smoking (2006) and Sully (2016) is something we will have to live with forever. Thats not to say the actor did not give it his best shot. Its just that everything is against him.When a director, in this case Brad Peyton (whose only credit is disaster film San Andreas ) hooks you up with the two assistants who look like theyve been ousted from a concert for being too wannabe punk, theres little a protagonist can do.Then theres Embers ability to enter other peoples subconscious, wheres hes got full use of his legs and dressed to the nine, nonetheless. Its all so convenient and cheesy. You see the process is not religious, so it cant be termed exorcism. Embers uses science to evict a spirit from a body with several monitors and medical equipment to trace the movements of the parasite inside a host. Basically, its tripe. Last and definitely not least are those possessed with their black eyes; more amusing than scary. Incarnate has no scares, thrills or chills and a glaring lack of originality. What little gore has been incorporated will be censored. So give it a miss, if you value your time and money.DEBORAH CORNELIOUS"

File photo: C. VenkatachalapathyWith the start of a new year, affordable prices are something that many consumers would look for. For a week now, mixed prices are prevailing in the vegetable markets, as traders say that the price of few vegetables have shot up, while the cost of a few have dropped, and these rates are here to stay for at least another week.The last week of 2016 saw the price of some vegetables such as onions, beans and broad beans (avarakkai) shoot up due to various reasons, according to A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam.The rates of beans and avarakkai have increased in the last two days. This is primarily because the quality of vegetables is good but the supply is less. Many consumers are purchasing the two vegetables and this has hiked the prices. These vegetables are supplied from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, he said.From costing Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 earlier, the rate of one kilo of beans has doubled toRs. 30 now, while the price of avarakkai has gone up from Rs. 15 to Rs. 25.All is not well with onions too. Mr. Balu said the onions supplied from Andhra Pradesh that were of medium size and even smaller used to be sold for Rs. 5 or Rs. 6 in Vellore.Now, the supply from AP has stopped, and onions from parts of Maharashtra such as Pune and Ahmednagar have started to arrive. Those procuring the stock have to pay Rs. 5 per kilo on commission and toll. So, onions are sold at Rs. 15 to Rs. 20 to fetch profit, he said.He added that it would take at least a week for the price of onions supplied from Maharashtra to stabilise.Drumsticks rate has also gone up as the mist affected flowering and yield. It was sold for Rs. 80.The rate of peas, which are usually priced high, could come as a surprise.

58e53ec07be9e05a951f65ea,MORE THAN JUST COMMUNISM,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1170101/jsp/nation/story_127948.jsp,2017-01-01,,Telegraph,"In India, the Russian Revolution and communism have come to be synonymous. But there was a time when it was not so, and a centennial year is an occasion when it is worth remembering the more complex story of inspiration and legacy that came of the events of 1917 in Russia. True, this is not easily done. By the time of Soviet disintegration in 1991, in India as in much of the world, remembering the Russian Revolution was a communist ritual, dutifully conducted on November 6. This has continued to the present. The Indian communist party press  New Age, Deshabhimani, Navayug, Ganashakti and many others  produced the striking red-edged supplements with a somewhat benign-looking Lenin staring at the world to mark the occasion. Inside, there have figured assemblages of the grand narrative of the 20th century  the rise of Soviet power and the global projection of the communist challenge, suitably adjusted to tell the nations story of communism from S.A. Dange and Muzaffar Ahmad to E.M.S. Namboodiripad, with sharp asides on which party had failed to observe which line. Meetings have tended to take place at Lenin statues through the country. The celebrations have mainly followed at Ajoy Bhavan or the communes off the Asaf Ali Road in Delhi or in places of congregation on a par with Bhupesh Bhavan in Calcutta. There would be CPI cha on offer  without milk and with a touch of lemon  a throwback to the Russian traditions that M.N. Roy, the Indian Comintern leader, noted in Moscow in 1920. This was the normal fare at Indo-Soviet communist meetings along with plates of cucumber, tomato and cheese delicately sliced with salami thrown in for non-vegetarians. Through all the fanfare, the events marked a further year of solidarity during the Cold War, and after 1991, everything that was left behind. This was solidarity built not only on political parties and trades unions but one that permeated a larger ambience. Communism and stories of the Russian Revolution were associated with the illustrated output of Soviet presses and the Peoples Publishing House that were distributed in schools  with the strains of communist marches and melodies of the communist cultural movements that were passed around on Melodiia records, magnetic tapes or CDs. The more fervent followers of communism listened to the Bengali services of Moscow Radio and the odd broadcast from the Peoples Republic of China, the former introduced by the telltale lilt of the popular song Evenings in Moscow. After 1991, the old faithful continued to look back with nostalgia. Significantly, there were marked divisions. The Revolution was celebrated independently in China and the Soviet Union, who had their own take on the occasion. In India, different parties had their own stories and legends to pass around  whether the SUCI or the RSP, CPI, CPM or the CPML. Outside the communist fraternity, newspapers docketed the experience and restricted themselves to noting one more year of the observance of its origin by the communist world from Cuba to Korea  the ritual, not the event, attracting comment. American Sovietologists pored over who was seen closest to whom at what podium in Moscow, where all spontaneity had been wrung out of the event by the heavy bureaucracy of the Soviet communist party. This harked to a complexity to the way the Revolution was received in the past but one that seldom attracted comment in the present, least of all in the USSR, which barred its own citizens let alone foreigners from free access to the archives dealing with the foundations of the Soviet state. In India, it was an unusual story. Socialism, let alone communism, attracted little discussion before 1917 and the Bolshevik uprising of October 25 (by the Julian Calendar). True, on October 23, when the now-forgotten Indian revolutionary, Virendranath Chattopadhyay, the villain of Somerset Maughams Ashenden stories, made contact with the Bolshevik establishment, he had already made interventions in socialist circles in Stockholm. But he was a true-blue nationalist who had a smattering of reading on the Left  his awareness not much off that of Har Dayal, who authored a book on Marx. For them, the Russian Revolution produced a sense of liberation  taking place as it did in the largest country in the world and one of the major powers of the day. Admirers of Russian revolutionaries, Indian revolutionaries were deeply moved by the fall of the Tsarist autocracy in February 1917. But Russias Provisional Government refused to provide even tacit support to the Indian revolutionaries based in Kabul (Mahindra Pratap, Mohammad Barkatullah and others). Bolshevik power re-ignited the magic. Not because it was a communist revolution but because it held out promise for national emancipation and, most emphatically, from its early days committed Bolshevik Russia to a quest for Indias freedom. A number of Indian revolutionaries rallied around Bolshevism during the Russian Civil War, appearing at the Baku Congress of the Workers of the East in 1920. Communism threatened to overlay nationalism on the Bolshevik agenda for India, after M.N. Roys formation of the Communist Party of India in October 1921 in Tashkent. And many duly left the ranks of fellow travellers, most well known being the revolutionaries Abdur Rab and M.P.B.T. Acharya. But, once again, the development of a Soviet civilisation model during the 1920s and 1930s, for all its inner tragedy and oppression, drew the attention of Rabindranath Tagore, Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose and, significantly, the future Swatantra Party leader Minoo Masani. As planning came to shape Indias industrial growth after 1947, the economists of the Indian Statistical Institute and the finance ministry in Delhi engaged with Moscow and Beijing to draw on their experience. The language of the Second Five Year Plan declared its socialist character  though the socialism would be home-grown and forged against the background of conflict with the CPI in Andhra and Kerala. From all this emerges the solid fact that Indias modern national ethos evolved in the shadow of the Russian Revolution; the symbols and practices of the October Revolution that was born from it entered the pattern of Indias state construction. Before and during the Cold War, the legacy of the revolution symbolised global alternatives and provided support to nationalism in an era where the countrys liberationist urges had only popular enthusiasm to back them: where a new crop of national leaders sought to be more than understudies to the great powers of the day. For India, the Russian Revolution was more than communism. It deeply marked the countrys coming of age.

58e543017be9e05a951f6b66,Vegetable spoilage? Try solar cart,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1170102/jsp/nation/story_128080.jsp,2017-01-02,,Telegraph,"New Delhi, Jan. 1: India's roadside vegetable vendors may soon get a chance to turn to the sun for reduced drudgery and a bit more take-home money. Scientists in New Delhi have designed a solar-powered vending cart that may help increase the shelf life of vegetables and alleviate the vendors' grind of sprinkling water on their vegetables on hot days. The solar power panels atop the cart generate electricity to evaporatively cool a closed chamber just beneath the vending platform, lowering the temperatures inside by 8C to 11C, the scientists at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) said. In field tests during summer, the evaporatively cooled cart - which requires about 20 litres of water a day - was able to keep fruits and vegetables fresh for two to five days compared to conventional carts where most vegetables spoil in less than two days. ""The evaporative cooling of the chamber is similar to the way desert coolers work,"" David Samuel, an agriculture engineering specialist at the IARI, told The Telegraph . The solar electricity powers a battery to run a fan blowing cooled air in the lower chamber that stores vegetables. Crop scientists estimate that about 35 per cent of India's annual fruits and vegetables harvested is lost through spoilage, primarily because of poor storage, and that much of these losses occur at roadside vending carts. Street-side vendors typically keep their vegetables on or within wet gunny bags or repeatedly sprinkle water on the vegetables on hot days. While this has a cooling effect, it also contributes to spoilage, with green leafy vegetables, tomatoes and cucumbers among others lasting only two days. When fruits or vegetables lose about 10 per cent of their weight through heat-driven moisture loss, they wilt, look bad and keep customers away. Vendors are forced to lower prices as vegetables approach spoilage and discard spoilt produce, losing income. The field tests by the IARI research group suggests that the evaporatively cooled vending cart can help maintain the freshness of vegetables, assessed through colour, texture and coarse appearance, for an average of five days, even longer for some vegetables - cabbage remained usable for 10 days and cauliflower and carrots for seven days inside the cooled chamber. ""The solar power vending cart is ideal for hot and dry weather,"" said Pramod Sharma, an agricultural engineering researcher who led the field experiments. The IARI scientists have published the results of their field tests in the journal Current Science. The IARI team estimates the solar-powered vending cart could be made available for about Rs 30,000, and the umbrella-like solar panel atop the cart's platform, the fan-and-cooling system, and the battery would increase the cart's weight by about 5kg to 8kg."

But in the past, Blumhouse Productions (founded by Jason Blum) has given us great scares in the form of horror series like Paranormal Activity , Insidious and The Purge . In fact, the company is responsible for The Hush , a 2016 horror thriller film that has an impressive 100 per cent holding on Rotten Tomatoes. Unfortunately, the company has hit a speed-bump by the name of Incarnate , perhaps the least scary possession film to ever grace a big screen.Wheelchair-bound Seth Embers (a thoroughly wasted albeit sincere Aaron Eckhart) can enter the subconscious minds of victims possessed by evil spirits. Hes handicapped after a car accident  caused by an inexplicably vindictive demon  that killed his wife and son. For years, hes been hunting Maggie as the evil entity has come to be known. Now shes taken a young boy hostage  one that looks eerily similar to his own deceased son  and Embers must evict the spirit from the boy.Theres also the Vatican involved in the form of a supremely attractive papal agent Camilla (Catalina Sandino Moreno), an unnecessary addition among many. Oh, and Lindsay, the possessed boys mother is played by Game of Throne s Carice van Houten. She so stoic, she barely tears up after witnessing the death of her estranged husband.To say Incarnate is derived is an understatement; there have been countless films with demon possessions. This writer didnt sleep for days after watching The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005). Yet, slumber was oh so sound after Incarnate , in fact perhaps even induced by the film. Lets spell it out in case there was any doubt: this film is a crashing bore.Why Eckhart would deign to waste his talent after films like Thank You for Smoking (2006) and Sully (2016) is something we will have to live with forever. Thats not to say the actor did not give it his best shot . Its just that everything is against him.DEBORAH CORNELIOUS"

How are things? I asked the man selling Prasad. Very bad, Hukum (Sir), he replied in a feeble voice. By this time of the year, thousands of people should have arrived here. The tourists are just not coming! Although by the time December 25 ended, the tourists began arriving and the hotel occupancy was full again.Tanot is a place where the Pakistani army dropped dozens of bombs during the 1965 war. Several of these bombs also dropped in the temple complex, but miraculously none of them exploded. The locals attribute this to the blessings of the Devi and that is why the temple is always thronged by local and outstation tourists. But at the time I visited it, the temple was deserted.The situation was not very different at the clock-tower located in the heart of Jodhpur. Here, vendors have set up stalls to sell handicrafts. My wife stood before a tribal lady selling junk jewellery. We were her first customers of the day. According to the lady, during winter, by the end of the afternoon, most people return home after selling their stock. The afternoon was almost over, but the stalls selling handicraft hadnt got too many buyers.Read: Demonetisation: Window to deposit banned notes nears end as Modi eyes key electionsThe decision on demonetisation has wreaked havoc on farmers, labourers and those who live on the margins. A research-based report in Hindustan Times this week talked about how farmers around the country were forced to sell their vegetables at wholesale mandis at minuscule prices.Onions sold for just Rs 1 per kilogramme in Madhya Pradeshs Mandsaur and tomatoes for Rs 3 a kg in Karnatakas Kolar. Cauliflower sold for Rs 3 per kg in Patna, peas for Rs 3 in Chandigarh and potatoes for just Rs 2 in Farrukhabad.Clearly the farmers are likely to spend the next few months in deprivation.Small industry has also been hit hard and forced to cut jobs. The government in Uttar Pradesh has even doled out a compensation of Rs 2 lakh each to 14 families whose loved ones died while waiting in ATM queues. Opposition parties say the number of people whove met an untimely death in this manner is more than hundred. The 50-day time limit that the prime minister had sought has ended. But people are still awaiting relief from cashlessness. When I passed through the village Bharol in Uttar Pradeshs Ferozabad district, I saw dozens standing in queues to draw money from an ATM. It was the 50th day of demonetisation.Because of these reasons, the Opposition, which had been in a semi-unconscious state for the last two and a half years, has suddenly found an opportunity to become aggressive. As 2017 begins, they want to put up a united front and evolve a combined strategy to corner the prime minister.So many aspersions wouldnt have been cast on the Union government had a few bank officials and their cronies hadnt found ways to dispense the new currency to turn their black money into white. It was highly unfortunate that at a time most bank employees were working day and night to alleviate the side-effects of demonetisation, some of their colleagues were busy sullying the image of the entire banking system. At one time, George Fernandes had said that wherever multinational banks had gone, they had encouraged corruption. Years later, his comment is ringing true. Most of those tainted were private bank employees. Employees of public sector banks also alleged that a larger number of currency notes were made available to private banks.This is an allegation that needs to be investigated.Read: We are with the Prime Ministers demonetisation drive: JD(U)Over the last few days, crores of currency has been recovered in raids across the country. The prime minister has been repeatedly warning at public forums that those still sitting on heaps of illegal currency should mend their ways. In 2017 no mercy will be shown to them. One hopes the government has set its sights on the big fish. The people still have confidence in the prime minister. And the man on the street is with him.Those who jump to hasty conclusions believe the PM has failed in his ambitious endeavour. Is that true? To find an answer, we return to the lady selling junk jewellery in Jodhpur. I asked her if she knew who had taken the decision to demonetise currency. Modiji, she replied. Is that a good thing or bad? The lady anxiously waiting for her first sale had her answer ready: Its good. Similarly workers engaged in repairing the Khama Fort near Jaisalmer said they were poor people. Theyd braved odds all their life but were confident that Mr Modi will set everything right.Clearly the common mans confidence in Modi hasnt been shaken. To keep it going, the Centre will have to make a Herculean effort. A lot will also depend on the manner in which the Indian economy responds. Assembly elections are due in five states including Uttar Pradesh in the next few months. Apart from a verdict on the incumbent governments in these states, these elections will also be a referendum on this bold initiative. If the prime minister and his colleagues can overcome this challenge, his popularity will rise more than any of his predecessors. If that doesnt happen, hell have to spruce up his politics once more, since the assembly polls of 2017 could well script the prologue to the 2019 general elections.Last, but not the least, greetings for the New Year! Indians exhausted of playing a Holi of political mudslinging can nurture a small hope in 2017: That this year brings with it a lot of things that make us feel cleaner.Shashi Shekhar is editor-in-chief, Hindustan"

(Hardeep Singh) The humble litti of Bihar-Jharkhand is on the roast for bon vivants from across the world. Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), the event manager of the Global Investors' Summit (GIS) in Ranchi, has roped in grub start-up GoLitti for the GIS food court in Hotwar on February 16-17 and the latter hopes to take the desi litti places with its trendy Chinese and Italian range of the traditional atta-sattu preparation. GoLitti - the state's lone branded litti joint that opened shop at Eastern Mall on Dangratoli Road only last month - is the brainchild of three friends, two of them BIT-Mesra alumni and the third a chartered accountant who left a plum job with Goldman Sachs in Bangalore to realise a big dream out of a small dough. Recalling his amazing culinary journey along with school friends and businessmen Kamal Bagla (23) and Sameer Kataruka (24), chartered accountant-turned-food manager Ankush Raj (23) told this newspaper how the inherent desire to make the homemade litti popular like the samosa or momo gave birth to GoLitti. ""A few years ago, when I moved to Delhi for my CA studies, I missed our litti-chokha, which is basically a super healthy baked dough ball stuffed with sattu (chickpea flour) and served with roasted and mashed potatoes, tomatoes, onion, chillies and spices. I shared my cravings with my Bridgeford School pals Kamal and Sameer one day, months later, and all of a sudden we had the idea,"" said Ankush. Raising a brand from a drawing room idea was no easy task. ""But, if there's will, there's a way. I quit Goldman Sachs in September last year and came to Ranchi. My businessmen friends, who are BBA graduates from BIT-Mesra, backed my dream while my mother Rita Sinha (49), a great cook, helped us rediscover litti in many avatars,"" Ankush said. GoLitti was born on January 15 this year, and is already a hot favourite with local residents and visitors alike, which includes representatives of the CII. ""We sell litti under two categories - evergreen and trendy. The first comprises the traditional baked variety along with Jain (no onion and garlic) and ghee-fried. The trendy menu boasts manchurian, schezwan, shashlik, corn, paneer, dahi, matar and mixed vegetable varieties among others,"" Ankush said, adding that officials of CII liked their preparations so much that the invite to join the GIS food court was almost immediate. And all this for just Rs 40 to Rs 95 a plate! ""We wanted to make litti loveable for all and we did it. Nothing pleases us more than when customers exclaim 'wow' after tasting our food. We will open a second joint in Ranchi in April. We are keeping fingers crossed and hoping that the summit will help us take GoLitti global,"" Ankush added."

Telegraph picture Balipada, Feb. 14: The small weekly village haat in Govindpur gram panchayat of Kantapada block in Cuttack district was buzzing with excitement today when Odia film stars reached here to campaign for Independent candidate Prashant Mohanty aka Jhallia Bhai for the panchayat poll. While the BJD has roped in all the big names among film stars for campaigning, those who have not joined the BJD today chose to campaign here for Independent candidates. The election to the gram panchayat will be held on February 17. As soon as the film stars reached the haat, people from all corners of Govindpur village - which has traditionally been considered a BJD bastion - flocked to the weekly market to catch a glimpse of them. The small-time traders of the haat also rushed to hear what all the film stars had to say, leaving their work behind. Film stars Amulya Patnaik, Debidatta Barik, Leena and Sabita, visited the Govindpur haat today. Asked why they had joined the campaign, Debidatta Barik said: ""We film stars are part of society. We joined the campaign to tell people that they should elect the right candidates. We are campaigning here for Jhallia Bhai whose son is a major in the Indian Army and is busy protecting our motherland. It is our duty to support him. We are not taking any money for this."" As soon as Barik completed his speech, the villagers rushed to shake hands with the actors. ""We have watched them in various films and serials. We are happy to see them in person here,"" said Bachhana Mallick. Even though the sarpanch seats are not contested on the party lines, people have a fair idea about the candidates whom the major parties are backing. The BJP, which has not been able to make substantial inroads in the coastal belt yet, is now slowly gaining ground. BJP flags were noticed in many villages in Govindpur and other parts of Niali Assembly constituency. While there is a fair chance that many Independent candidates will do well in the sarpanch election, the BJD is going to face a tough fight from the BJP for the first time in the zilla parishad elections. The Congress is also making all-out efforts to make its presence felt in the state. ""We will not reveal who we are going to vote for. We will follow certain criteria in selecting the candidates. For the sarpanch, we will elect a candidate who is honest and can do something good for the villages. But for the zilla parishad, we will pick the party candidates. However, I cannot reveal who I am going to vote for,"" said tomato seller Bhibhu Das. As soon as the road show ended at Govindpur, the film stars moved to another village. ""It is really a good experience to be part of the panchayat poll campaign. My suggestion to people is that they should exercise their voting rights and take part in the election process,"" said one actor."

The school grounds turned into a fun space and students, their parents, grandparents and teachers had a good time. The games stalls put up by students and teachers kept everyone busy. Also available was an array of lip-smacking food. We danced and had a lot of fun, said Madhureem Banerjee, a student of Class VII. Principal Indrani Sanyal was happy at the popularity of the event and the increase in footfall. Its a place to enjoy. Even some grandparents dropped in and had who are enjoying their time. There is so much of joy in the air. Every one is enjoying themselves. The proceeds from the carnival will be invested in a village that we have adopted in Rajarhat. Selina Nwulu, young poet laureate for London, visited DPS Megacity for a workshop with the students. The students expected to see a poet but Nwulu turned out to be a writer and researcher focusing on social justice, politics, education and gender while also being a strong environment and human rights campaigner. She reminded the students that as poet, she has her writing to be used as a powerful tool which could effect change in a variety of fields. She captivated the students for an hour and a half. THE BSS SCHOOL Melange 2016, the annual fete of The BSS School, was an occasion to bond over good food, music and games. Students, former and current, and their parents joined the happy celebrations. Game stalls included hunting for objects from a bucket full of sand and taking aim with a ball to topple a pyramid made of plastic glasses. While these activities kept visitors engaged, the fare at the food stalls ensured that they did not go hungry. Quetzal Club whipped up tomato and sweet corn soup and butter corn, while cupcakes from Calcutta Cupcakes provided the perfect sweet ending. A guest performance by Samantak and Mates was the cherry on the cake. This is my first year at The BSS School and I was quite nervous as I had to shoulder quite a few responsibilities. However, I am happy that everyone loved the arrangements, said Sriroopa Dutta, a Class XI student. Text: Samabrita Sen, Farah Khatoon, Sarthak Ganguly, Tanisha Bagchi & Chandrajit Mitra; pictures: B.

PHOTO: N. BASHKARANN_BASHKARANA 25-year-old female elephant was shot dead by two men in Ulipandaa village on the fringes of Jawalagiri reserve forest on Monday night.The animal was found dead with two bullet injuries on her forehead on Tuesday morning by the locals, who alerted the officials. The elephant was part of a small migratory herd from the North Cauvery Wild Life Sanctuary that stretches from Karnataka to Tamil Nadu.The accused, whose identity was not known, were from the same village and had allegedly indulged in wild boar hunting in Ulipandaa in the past. Hunting of wild boars is an offence in Tamil Nadu, though the Central government had declared the species to be vermin in a few States.On Monday night, the accused A.Basavaraj (34), son of Anumadhappa, and his friend T.Madesh, son of Thimmarayappa, were reportedly waiting in a tomato field. Basavaraj had taken the land adjoining the tomato field on lease for cultivation.The duo and three other men were waiting for the wild boar, when they spotted the elephant grazing afar. Basavaraj allegedly used his country-made gun to shoot down the elephant.On Tuesday morning, a team consisting of officials from the Forest Department, including Conservator of Forests, Dharmapuri, Ashish Kumar Srivastava, District Forest officer, Hosur, Rajendran, along with Hosur Sub Collector Senthil Raju, accompanied by the police reached Ulipanda on receiving the alert from locals.The Forest Department has booked the men under Section 9, 39 and 51 of Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, and under Section 25(1)(A) of the Indian Arms Act 1959; and under Section 9 B (1) (b) Indian Explosive Substance Act , 1908.The police arrested Madesh and picked up two others in the village, while the prime accused, Basavaraj, is not traceable.Firing unprovokedMr. Srivastava told The Hindu that the accused could not have shot the elephant in self-defence as there were no signs of aggression.A Revenue Department official similarly, said the the accused had taken time to aim at the head of the elephant that was grazing at a distance.A parallel report will be submitted by the Revenue Department to the government.The three-tonne elephant could not be shifted along the difficult unmotorable terrain of the village. Hence, an autopsy was carried on the spot and was buried at the same spot.Quite a few instances of shooting with illegal country-made guns in Thally and Denkanikottai area have been reported over personal enmity."

Prakash Kammardi. This situation has arisen as there is a bountiful harvest of various crops because of good rains in other States as well as countries. Either the cheap crops from other States are entering our markets or there is no demand for our produce in other markets because of glut in their own areas, he said.It is like rubbing salt into the wound of farmers who have already suffered crop losses owing to serious drought or floods as they may have to not only suffer reduction in yield, but also crash in the prices, notes the The Perspective and Forecasting report by the KAPC.According to the commissions report, what has complicated the matter is the impact of demonetisation. This has prevented the recovery of prices of some crops besides leading to a dip in the price of others owing to poor cash flow in the markets, Dr. Kammardi said.The commissions report has pointed out that the prices of tomato and onion have crashed by 84 per cent and 70 per cent respectively, when compared with the earlier level; and that of copra and arecanut have seen a dip of 47 per cent and 7 per cent respectively after demonetisation.The commission has suggested to the State government to take up the issue with NABARD as well as the Union government to increase the daily money withdrawal limit for farm traders in agricultural produce marketing committees (APMC) in the interest of farmers.Pointing out that the norms related to monetary withdrawal limits from banks were relaxed for tea growers of some areas, Dr. Kammardi sought similar benefit to be extended to APMCs as nearly 41 per cent of the trading of farm produce takes place in these markets.This is one of the worst harvest seasons for farmers in terms of prices in the last several decades. This has resulted owing to glut in production in other States/countries coupled with the impact of demonetisation.T.N. Prakash Kammaradi, Chairman, Karnataka Agriculture Price Commission"

A tomato vendor waits for customers at Urma in Purulia. Picture by Mita Roy Farmer Balaram Kisku, who has cultivated around 100 quintals of tomato in Purulia in November-December, has been feeding a part of his produce to cattle instead of letting it rot in the fields. Agriculture department officials said the demand for tomato was all the more hit because people in eastern India can do without the fruit-vegetable in the kitchen, unlike potato or onion. According to the officials, around 1,000 tomato farmers had been hit in Purulia and Bankura. ""I sold tomato at Rs 20 a kg between October and November. The demand started falling in the middle of November and with it, the price too came down. The situation has come to such a pass that I am being forced to sell a bucket of tomato (around 20-22kg) for only Rs 10 to the wholesalers,"" said Kisku, a resident of Hatinada village on the Ayodhya hills. The vegetable trade has been hit hard in rural Bengal, where wholesalers depend on cash and digital transactions are still a hard nut to crack. ""The cash crunch has left vegetable farmers in serious trouble. The situation is worse for tomato growers because people can do without tomato for days. If people have cash, they would rather spend on potato than tomato,"" an agriculture department official said. In Purulia and Bankura, farmers usually grow tomato between October and March. Officials said the dry climate in the two districts and the hilly terrain are conducive to growing tomato. In the last season, about 3,000 tonnes of tomato had been supplied to various parts of the country from Purulia and Bankura. But this time, the demand has plunged several notches. Ramesh Pandit, a Dhanbad-based tomato wholesaler who owns a warehouse in Purulia's Balarampur, said around 150 quintals of the fruit-vegetable were lying unsold with him. Sources in the agriculture department said a good production this time had added to the trouble of tomato wholesalers in Bengal, which has very few multipurpose cold storage and processing units."

But as the week proceeded, and the alliance talks got stuck, jubilation turned into despondency  especially among Muslims, the community that has driven this alliance more than any other.In Bareilly, barely 24 hours before the SP-Congress alliance was officially announced on Sunday, a young Muslim journalist who writes for local Urdu papers, said: When Akhilesh got the cycle, there was great excitement; today, there is a sense of hopelessness in the community. The alliance must happen.In western U.P.s 125 Assembly constituencies, the Muslims are the single largest bloc, roughly 38 per cent of the population (across the State, it is 18 per cent).For Muslims, the Modi government has heightened its sense of insecurity, with the free run it has given RSS outfits to run campaigns targeted against them  from love jihad and ghar wapsi to cow protection vigilantism. There is a determination, therefore, in the community to use its numbers to influence next months poll results.Community divisionsClass, educational backgrounds and even caste may divide the community, but an overwhelming majority is rooting for Akhilesh Yadav and a SP-Congress alliance, from lawyers in Muzaffarnagar, to madrasa students in Bareilly, to businessmen and artisans alike in Moradabad, to tomato farmers in Sambhal.Their reasons vary: if students and young farmers see Akhilesh bhaiyya as emblematic of their aspirations, Urdu scholar Murtaza Iqbal in Moradabad says, The SP is the flip side of the BJP, with its politics also helping to polarise votes. But Akhilesh, unlike his father Mulayam Singh, is seen as non-partisan. And if the Congress joins the alliance, it will have a moderating influence on the SP.For the SP-Congress alliance, there is, of course, one major obstacle, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), that has a major advantage in western UP  the Jataav vote that is about 14 per cent in this belt and which is going to turn out in full strength for it.In addition, with the most backward castes having largely deserted her, BSP supremo Mayawati has been promoting the idea of a Dalit-Muslim alliance in this election. She has given 97 seats to members of the community, with 36 from this region of the State.This poses a challenge to the SP, for whom the Muslims are the base vote in western UP. But as I travelled through the districts of Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Saharanpur, Bijnor, Moradabad, Bareilly and Badayun, it was clear Muslims will only vote for the BSP when they find the SP-Congress candidate cannot defeat the BJP.Of course, there are instances such as in the Swar constituency, where SP strongman Azam Khans rookie son Abdullah is pitted against the BSPs Kazim Ali Khan, the Nawab of Rampur: the Muslim votes could get divided here.As for the Congress, its eight per cent votes will come in handy for the SP, as it is likely to chip away at the BJPs upper caste votes.People are not prepared to give it a starring role in Battleground UP, but feel it will play a competent supporting role.As a young government in Badayun said, We want a milijuli sarkar (a coalition government); enough of these Hitlers."

I will be filing a PIL against the Prime Minister as to why criminal procedures not be initiated against the PM for crippling the rural economy,"" Raina said, adding he was consulting his lawyers. Raina, the president of the Haryana Agro Forestry Farmers' Association, said the note ban had crippled the wood industry in the BJP-ruled state and resulted in huge lay-offs. He claimed the industry had to shut down for a month after demonetisation while potato, tomato and fruit growers were hit so hard that they had been forced to sell their produce below cost. Raina, who hails from Kurukshetra, claimed he had been an active member of the BJP since 2006 and was working with the Muslim Rashtriya Manch, led by RSS leader Indresh Kumar. The Manch describes itself as an association of ""nationalist Muslims and functionaries of the RSS"". BJP leaders claimed they did not know Raina and declined comment on his assertions. ""Anybody can claim he is a BJP member. How can one react to somebody's claim?"" said a BJP national secretary, refusing to be quoted on record. Kumar, the Manch leader, could not be contacted. Raina, however, said he was a ""responsible citizen"" and came from an ex-servicemen family where many had won bravery awards. He claimed many in the BJP and the RSS felt demonetisation had wrecked the nation's economy but were not speaking out because of personal reasons. Raina said he had written a letter to the Prime Minister and sought his resignation, allegedly over deaths caused by the note ban. He repeated the demand today and called upon the BJP to elect a new leader. ""All over India, the situation is catastrophic and frightening due to demonetisation...The Prime Minister has to take the onus of these deaths and step down with immediate effect. Let the BJP members of the Lok Sabha take a decision to elect another Prime Minister,"" Raina has said in the letter. A copy has been sent to L.K.

Picture by Ashwinee Pati Bhubaneswar, March 4: A group of farmers today spilled milk and throw vegetables on the road to protest against the government's apathy leading to their crop loss and distress sale. The farmers' wing of the state BJP led the agitation near the Assembly and mobilised the peasants to protest against the ""apathetic attitude"" of the state government on the concluding day of the first phase of Assembly session. The protest, however, failed to make a mark as was evident from agriculture minister Pradeep Maharathy's speech in the House. Maharathy today said Hadu Bagarti, the Bargarh farmer who recently committed suicide due to alleged crop loss, died because of family feud and not crop loss. Making a statement in the House, Maharathy said: ""I have received the district collector report, which says Hadu Bagarti had consumed poison following a bitter quarrel with his wife."" It was alleged that Bagarti committed suicide by consuming poison on Monday following crop loss. But, the minister said: ""There was no crop loss. But, he had an altercation with his wife as to whether manure and pesticide should be given in the land."" While Opposition members decried the government version in the House, hundreds of farmers gathered at PMG Square and spilled milk and dumped vegetables on the road. They had demanded compensation for crop loss and establishment of adequate cold storages where they could preserve their produces. BJP Krushak Morcha president Shivaji Mohanty blamed lack of storage facilities and marketing opportunities for the crop loss and distress sale. ""This forces farmers to sell tomatoes at 25 paise per kg and brinjal and cabbages at Re 1 per kg,"" said Mohanty. He said the financial condition of the state's farmers was deteriorating rapidly, forcing them to commit suicide. ""Dairy farmers are another neglected lot. They do not have storage facility and government apathy is contributing to loss for them,"" said Mohanty. This is not the first time that farmers dumped their produce on roads to mark protest in the state. Earlier this month, the farmers had also dumped tomatoes in front of the Keonjhar collector's office. Last year, dairy farmers had spilled gallons of milk on roads in Bargarh and Puri. ""The government is not bothered about our situation. They only claim that they are pro-farmer, but the ground reality is different. They are not providing us necessary inputs and the lack of cold storage forces us to sell our produces at lower rates,"" said Bimbadhar Jena, a protesting farmer. On the other hand, dairy farmers reiterated their demand to include milk as an item in midday meal. ""If the government includes milk in the midday meal scheme, it will not only provide nutrition to students, but also help us sell our produce. The government should revise the sale price of milk to Rs 30 a litre,"" said dairy farmer Jhagadu Yadav. Social workers and activists also backed the protest and urged the government to address farmers' plight. ""We are an agrarian state and there should be special emphasis on this sector. The government had decreased budgetary outlay for agriculture this year, which is not good. If we don't care about our food providers, we will die of starvation,"" said social worker Alok Mohanty. ""The government should not be so insensitive to the farmers' cause. Bagarti had taken loan from the co-operative bank. He was shaken following the crop loss. Now, the government is trying to paint it otherwise,"" said BJP MLA Pradip Purohit."

NDDB chairman Dilip Rath told the media this evening that the unit was being set up by Mother Dairy Fruits and Vegetables, a wholly owned subsidiary of NDDB, at an expenditure of Rs 82.77 crore. ""It is being set up in two phases. The first phase comprising an IQF (individual quick freezers) freezing line with an annual capacity of 5,650 tonne will be commissioned tomorrow,"" he said. Products of this facility will be marketed under Safal, the brand used by Mother Dairy. Mother Dairy managing director S. Nagarajan, who was also present at the briefing, said civil construction of the second phase comprising a pulp processing unit of 17,700 tonne capacity was also nearly complete. It would be commissioned by the end of the year. In the first phase, freezing of vegetables, particularly green peas, would be taken up, while in the second phase, processing of tomatoes would be done. ""But quality of tomatoes available locally is not of processing variety. Hence, its quality needs to be upgraded,"" Nagarajan said, adding they had already engaged their procurement team for motivating farmers to use high quality seeds for getting the desired yield. ""The turnover of the facility in its full capacity is pegged at Rs 150 crore with around 45 per cent likely to be transferred to farmers,"" NDDB chairman Rath said, adding that the unit would also spur massive direct and indirect employment in ancillary services like supply chain, logistics and transportation. NDDB got the clearance from the state government in December 2015 for setting up the fruit and vegetable processing plant on a plot measuring about 27 acres in Nagri. Besides retail sale of vegetables, it also plans to prepare sauce and pulp concentrates using fruits such as banana, guava, mango, papaya and litchi. Jharkhand is among the six largest green peas and tomato producing states. NDDB chose Jharkhand for its ecology, considered ideal for horticulture landscaping. Besides, the use of pesticides is also less in Jharkhand compared to other states north India."

Sarma made the statement in the Assembly after BJP legislator Ganesh Kumar Limbu drew the minister's attention to an increasing number of cancer cases in the state. Cancer cases in the state rose from 24,846 in 2011, to 25,119 in 2012, 25,391 in 2013 and 25,663 in 2014. The minister said an excessive use of pesticides and chemical fertilisers by farmers is taking a toll on the people's health and causing diseases like cancer. Scientific studies have proven this. Sarma proposed the formation of an inter-departmental committee of the health and agriculture departments to address this problem. ""As Assam imports many food items from other states, we require a national policy to regulate the use of fertilisers and pesticides. We will bring it to the notice of the Union health ministry,"" he said. Harmful chemical fertilisers and pesticides are being used to grow crops and artificial ripening agents such as calcium carbide are being used to ripen fruits like mangoes and bananas. Artificial colours are being used in fruits such as watermelon, papaya, pomegranates and vegetables such as capsicum, carrots, tomatoes and so on. These chemicals are said to be carcinogenic and also interfere with the digestive system, causing peptic ulcers. BJP legislator Pranab Kalita today raised the issue of the alleged use of formalin, a toxic and carcinogenic chemical commonly used to preserve bodies in mortuaries, to prevent fish from decomposing during transportation. ""It is a major cause of concern for us as Assam imports a large quantity of fish from other states. Moreover, some other harmful chemicals are also reportedly being used to grow more and bigger fish,"" said Kalita. He sought an inquiry into this matter and fisheries minister Parimal Suklabaidya agreed. Suklabaidya said Assam imported 14,825 metric tonnes (MT) fish during 2015-16. He said the figure was 12,830MT in 2013-14 and 12,531MT in 2014-15. He said Assam imports fish mostly from Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. He said a restriction has been imposed on fishing during the breeding season, which is from April 1 to July 15, to increase the number of indigenous fish species in waterbodies and rivers of the state. ""In the budget, the establishment of a live gene bank has been proposed in coordination with State College of Fisheries at Raha for the conservation of local species of fish,"" the minister said."

Set up by Mother Dairy Fruits and Vegetables, a wholly-owned NDDB subsidiary, at a cost of Rs 82.77 crore, the plant has come up on a 27-acre plot 40km from the capital. Processed products would be sold under the well-known Mother Dairy brand Safal. Union minister of state for agriculture and Lohardaga MP Sudarshan Bhagat, state agriculture minister Randhir Kumar Singh, NDDB chairman Dilip Rath, chief secretary Rajbala Verma and Nagri farmers were also present. In his address, the chief minister said this plant was in line with their mission to make Jharkhand self-sufficient in the agro sector. In the coming days more such units would be set up. ""This plant won't just directly procure fruits and vegetables locally to process them and sell within and outside the state, but will also generate lots of employment,"" he said to a crowd of around 500. ""Around 70 per cent of total jobs generated by the plant will get jobs immediately when the first phase of the plant starts now. When the second phase is ready for launch and operations by this year-end, more jobs will get created,"" he added but did not specify how many direct and indirect jobs would be generated. Asked for an idea of the kind of numbers they were looking at, B.S. Khanna, managing director of Jharkhand Milk Federation, which NDDB runs, said they estimated ""500 direct jobs"" when the plant operates fully, while indirect jobs would be ""at least double"". Set up in two phases, the first phase of the plant comprises an IQF (individual quick freezer) with an annual capacity of 5,650 tonne which will start immediately while the second will have a pulp processing unit of 17,700 tonne annual capacity, civil works for which are also underway. In the first phase, freezing of vegetables, particularly green peas, would be the focus. The second phase would be geared mainly around tomato processing. The total annual turnover of the plant in its full capacity is pegged at Rs 150 crore with around 45 per cent likely to be transferred to farmers,said state agriculture department officials. The chief minister maintained that the government was working out plans to make farmers adapt progressive and organic farming. ""We have signed a few MoUs for skill-building centres in agriculture sector during the Global Investors' Summit which will soon see the light of day,"" he said. Advising farmers to take up flower cultivation, Das said if the floriculture sector started blooming, the government would start planning units to convert flowers into various end products. ""We earmarked Rs 700 crore in 2017-18 budget only for skill mission and there is lot of potential in agriculture and animal husbandry,"" he said.

58f50a057be9e018510a210a,Making electric sense,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170108/jsp/opinion/story_129076.jsp,2017-01-08,,Telegraph,"When young students first start to study art history they often make the elementary mistake of putting different movements and artists into quite rigid chronologies, forgetting that people and events in history - like colour on a canvas - often bleed and dribble into each other. For a long time there was a certain accepted progression that mid-20th-century Western art followed: before the Second World War there were the Europeans who were important, Picasso, Matisse, Klee and the Surrealists, followed by the shift of power from Paris to New York, when Abstract Expressionism was arrived at and the great Abs Ex painters exploded across the art firmament; then, counter to the Abs Ex gang came the Pop Art wallas, Rauschenberg, Johns, Warhol, followed by a whole host of others, themselves followed by the various art movements of the 1960s and then the 1970s and so on, forming a neat and orderly graph. Convenient as this was, to put on a timeline in a book, reality was somewhat different. Kandinsky and Rodchenko, and then Klee, and then the Bauhaus crew, and the soon overlapping Georgia O'Keeffe had all pushed the envelope of non-representational painting well before the 1940s. Marcel Duchamp and the Dadaists had already challenged the gallery-oriented, market-oriented narrative of the 'maestro' and 'masterpiece' with great verve and humour, Man Ray had exploded (among many other things) the fetish of the 'painterly hand', well before Pop Art spilled out from a quickly cut open can of Campbell's tomato soup. Abs Ex may have gained traction only after WW2, but people such as Arshile Gorky and Josef Albers were already pushing the next generation of young painters into jettisoning cubist distortions of actual organic and inorganic forms and going for 'pure' abstraction, for undiluted mark-making. Even as the New York art establishment began to recognize and champion Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Willem De Kooning and others, already an only slightly younger generation was starting to tug at the carpet under the feet of the Abs Ex painters. By the early 1950s, Rauschenberg was hanging out with composer John Cage and his partner, choreographer Merce Cunningham, at Black Mountain College in North Dakota and opening up his mind in ways that were very different from what the Abs Ex people were thinking. By the mid-1950s, several different pots of artwork, some of them highly 'experimental', were bubbling in different dilapidated kitchens across America and a western Europe still licking its wounds from the ravages of the war. While the Abs Ex painters were in full flow, so were the duo of Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, later joined by Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, James Rosenquist and Claes Oldenburg, all of whom loosely formed what is labelled American Pop Art. In West Germany, Joseph Beuys and associated artists had already begun to change the game with the first Documenta show at Kassel. People who would do huge public works such as Christo, massive earthworks in landscape like Robert Smithson, and the single parent of video art, Nam June Paik, were all about to start their dialogue with the (then largely Western) public. I could have seen the big Abstract Expressionist retrospective at the Royal Academy at several points over last autumn but, as luck would have it, I managed to make it on one of the last days of the show, with a trip to Tate Modern to catch the newly opened retrospective of Robert Rauschenberg just a few days later. To be able to immediately compare and contrast these two connected but opposed bodies of work was a piece of great good fortune. The show at the RA repeatedly reminds us that it is the first big UK retro of the Abs Ex painters since 1959. This fact is startling and it leads to a bifurcating conclusion, one that eats its own tail, so to speak. On the one hand, it speaks of ubiquitousness of Abs Ex as the canonical narrative of post-war art internationally, the grand scale, the primacy of colour, the heroic (usually male) painter making these feverish or highly meditative marks, leaving layered pigment spoors of his body on the canvas, this 'model' that has been the most copied by artists outside the Western world over the last 60-odd years; in other words, who needs to see another Pollock, Rothko or De Kooning when they are so present everywhere and when there are so many sub-abstractionists about? On the other hand, it also speaks of the insularity of the UK art establishment, an insularity that (till the early 90s at least) is not uncoupled with an inferiority complex vis--vis the brash, loud, indefatigably inventive art cousins from across the pond; that is, why should we big up this dated form of picture-making when we have so many great artists of our own, doing everything from modern figurative to abstraction to Pop to dodgy suspended sharks and soiled beds? Whatever the logic for the 57-year-long ignore, the RA show makes some amends with its size and spread. It's a great pleasure to be confronting Pollock's manic splatter, entire canvases, rectangular islands encrusted as if by deliberate coloured bird-droppings from very intelligent avian beings, to be immersed in the chroma- dhrupad of Rothko, to let the eyes be led a dance again by the starkly beautiful black and white slashes and whorls of Franz Kline and Robert Motherwell. The curators of the show make the case that these painters were painting at a time of great anxiety for the human race, when the Cold War and the various mid-century upheavals held us hostage from many different directions, and that a great humanist vision actually comes through the most controlled Ad Reinhardt as it does in the craziest Willem De Kooning. I love this work, but I'm far from sure about this argument. Whatever its beginnings, after a while Abs Ex provided yet another closed club, yet another notional, canonical top table, with all the suspect money and power of the millionaire collectors attached. Sure, most of the brilliant painters in this show retain a sense of play, and of great meditative gravitas, but ultimately they could not stop Abstract Expressionism from becoming what it did - a fetishistic commodity art divorced from the reality around it. For the connection to the real, to the immediate, to the thorny, barbed wired daily experience of mid-20th century America, for the belly laughs and a very different meditation you have to go to Robert Rauschenberg. The eye, the sheer joy and intelligence of this man, one of the greatest artists (and not just of the 20th century), is hard even to outline in the space available here. But let me just recount one thing that struck me when I first discovered Rauschenberg as a young art student in late 1970s America, that of all these mostly white and mostly male painters who made up the American Art All-stars of the 50s, 60s, 70s and the 80s, RR was the one who seemed to have internalized the chaos and craziness of street Calcutta without ever having been there. The trousers stuck to the canvas and painted over, the goat with a tyre around its middle, the combine painting Bed, splattered with paint and gestures brazenly hijacked from the Abs Ex guys yet taken to another level with the iconic pillow and the quilt, the controlled pictorial noise of the big silk screen 'collages' all, still, make electric sense in today's world, and light up connections across widely different cultures. There is the poetry of chance married to rigorous looking, great hedonism of material leavened by monkish self-denial of any self-indulgence. Looking at contemporary art, Indian or otherwise, I'm often struck by what I call 'strategic visual amnesia'. The works presented often make no acknowledgment of their debt to what has gone before: it's as if people like Claes Oldenburg or Cindy Sherman - to mention just two artists - had never existed, never produced any work. Looking at Rauscehnberg's huge range, from the all black canvases of the early 1950s to the gossamer constructions of the Hoarfrost series, the spiky combines, the hypnotic silk screen blow-ups, the performance and video art, the textile based work made in Ahmedabad in the mid-1970s, you realize here is someone who is at once so open and generous about the debts he owes his predecessors and yet such is his discipline and inventiveness that so many people who've followed him will have no choice but to acknowledge how much he opened their eyes, hearts and minds. As I leave the Rauschenberg show, I get word on my mobile that John Berger has died at the age of 90. A friend who loves Berger's writing sends me this line which makes so much sense in the context of both the shows I have just seen: ""The function of the work of art,"" Berger sums up (Max) Raphael, ""is to lead us from the work to the process of creation which it contains."""

Several tropes from the Vijay films are replicated here  the precocious childhood, the early initiation into the world of crime, the abiding influence of the Mother figure, the bonding within the community of crooks, the loyalty for the mentor and the eventual breaking away and establishment of ones own power centre. And, of course, the wordplay in dialogue after dialogue. My favourite is the mother saying that she doesnt want to give her son to acquire udhar ka nazariya (borrowed point of view) but to have his own chaukas nazar (a sharp insight).Yet theres more to the film. If Vijay addressed the angst of the day and the prevalent cynicism against the system, Raees, though lot less intense and brooding and more brassy and overstated, is also rooted in a specific point in time and a place.

Wholesale traders noted that the market received only 220 truckloads of vegetables against its daily share of 300 lorries on Monday. This had led to short supply of vegetables such as carrot, brinjal, beans and beetroot.Lorries mainly from southern parts of the State refrained from transporting goods even though the Tamil Nadu State Lorry Owners Federation had announced that essential goods supply would not be affected. Dry weather and drought conditions in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka were also cited to be another reason for the steady increase in the cost of some vegetables.P.Sukumar, joint secretary, Koyambedu Fruits, Flowers and Vegetables Market, said on Monday, some vegetables, including cabbage, carrot, beans and broad beans were costlier by 25% than last week due to short supply. Vegetables such as brinjal and carrot were priced between Rs. 30-Rs. 40 a kg. The prices doubled in the initial two days of the strike as residents bought more to stock owing to strike. However, prices of onion, tomato and potato remain stable. They are sold at less than Rs. 25 a kg in wholesale market as most of the stock is procured from Maharashtra and other parts of north India. Meanwhile, about 200 traders participated in a demonstration in support of the farmers demands for loan waiver and drought relief fund."

There too, the Kutch Asmita Manch members waved black flags when the rally was passing through the town. They also shouted slogans against the Congress party However, because of heavy police deployment, altercation between the two groups was avoided.When the rally reached Bhuj, Vaghela held a press conference where he alleged that BJP wants to transform Kutch into Bangkok. ""They (BJP) want to convert Kutch into a sex hub,"" he added.During the press conference, one woman member of Mandvi taluka panchayat, who is a member of the BJP, alleged that she was raped and mentally tortured by BJP leaders. ""When I lodged rape complaint, many of the top leaders tortured me mentally and asked me to withdraw my complaint,"" said the woman who had come with her face covered. ""I have come to this Congress programme to seek justice for myself,"" she added.Later, when the rally reached Gandhidham in the evening, members of the Kutch Asmita Manch shouted slogans against the Congress party and some even threw tomatoes on the rally. This agitated the Congress members who entered into a fist fight with the Kutch Asmita Manch members. However, police quickly swung into action and separated both the groups."

Those conquistadors  the Spanish and the Portuguese  sailing in on their schooners, clippers and frigates, touched down in India and brought with them these fruits of labour from the New World. With the infusion of these vegetables  especially the chilli  Indian cooking techniques were never the same again.While that's history for you, here is a lesson in statistics. India produces the highest quantity of chillies in the world. We are also the world's biggest exporter and consumer of the product. Over one-third of the country's chilli is produced in one region  the Andhra Pradesh-Telangana belt, which also gives us one of our most prized peppers, the diabolically hot Guntur chilli.From Kashmir to Kanyakumari, Nagaland to Rajasthan , our soil produces some of the world's most bewildering variety of chillies. Take the examples of the Kashmiri mirch (flavourful yet zingy) or the byadagi from Karnataka (pungent and eye-watering). And then there are those northeast bombshells  the dalle from Sikkim and the dhani lanka from Meghalaya, Tripura and Bengal.And finally, above all else, is the bhoot jolokia. Cultivated across the northeast, especially in Assam , Nagaland and Manipur, it is also called naga mirch, u-morok and ominously, the ghost chilli. Consistently proven to be one of the hottest peppers in the world, it was at one time being considered for use in tear gas shells. A bite of the bhoot jolokia can numb your mind and transport you into an otherworldly zone of intensely painful euphoria. It's not for the faint-hearted. All of this is to point out that whether the chilli came from Mexico or wherever else, nowhere is it as celebrated as in India. From curries and pastes, to pickles and salads, there's some mirchi in almost everything we eat. Chillies are a rich source of Vitamin C and are loaded with antioxidants that help fight cancer. They act as digestives and have no calories. It's time we stopped being apologetic about our hot and pungent food and embraced its fiery goodness. After all, what's life without a little mirchi?This is amma's special recipe from the kitchens of Andhra and its not for the faint-hearted. Andhra cuisine is famous for its spicy dishes and mamsam guntu, as the name suggests, uses the eye-watering Guntur chilli in liberal doses. Made with chicken or mutton, this delicacy really rubs it in with a pungent mix of chillies and ground condiments and also a generous helping of green chillies to top up the heat. As you bite into the succulent pieces of meat, be sure you'll shed tears. Whether these are of joy or regret depends on your capacity to weather hot food. You can try this dish with steamed rice and a dollop of ghee. Trust us, it will be an unforgettable experience.Taco is a traditional Mexican dish composed of a corn or wheat tortilla folded or rolled around a filling. This chicken tinga taco's filling has shredded chicken, slow roasted tomato salsa and chipotle chillies. These blazing hot chillies turn the predictable tacos into loaded, sizzling time bombs. Chipotle chillies are imported from Mexico. Since they come as dry chillies, they are first reconstituted to make a sauce, which is used in this spicy taco.Here's something for the vegetarians. This starter is a Vietnamese speciality of potatoes tossed with herbs and hot Sriracha chilli sauce. Sriracha chillies come from the coastal city of Si Racha, in Chonburi Province of eastern Thailand . The beauty of this dish is that the hotness of the chilliesexplode in your mouth before dissolving in a haze of piquancy.This is a Spanish prawn dish cooked in a spicy peri peri sauce made from fiery red and ripe bird's eye chillies. The prawns are fried in olive oil with garlic and cloves and then cooked in the spicy sauce. It is served with Spanish seafood paella rice sauted withsaffron to balance the hotness of the prawns.This oh-so-hot starter is prepared with lantern chillies, ginger and green onion. These chillies come from China and are used for not just its flavour but also for the special heat they add to the dish. The chillies are revered for their intense pungency and take the typical chilli chicken to a zone of untasted white-hot flavours.One of the staple dishes of Kerala, mutton pepper dry has boti pieces of mutton roasted with crushed Malabar pepper and Kerala spices. The tadka also consists of dhani chilli powder, which adds to the spicy taste of the dish. The dhani or bird's eye chilli is tiny but packs a punch in terms of spiciness. It is used not only for cooking but also in chutneys and pickles.It will set fire to your taste buds, but is worth a try.

Ema is chilli and datshi means cheese. It is made from different types of hot chillies (green, red or white) and cheese (datshi, the local Bhutanese cheese). This hot stew of chillies and cheese is unique and can be had as a soup or a dip. The melted cheese and the punch of chillies leave a beautifulaftertaste. It is a big hit with youngsters and vegetarians who throng this restaurant. A word of caution: if you are not used to hot spices, you might want to have a fire extinguisher handy, or some other form of quick relief, when you try this out. Also, The Blue Poppy's momos are as famous as its momo sauce. The extremely spicy momo sauce has a pinch of dalle chilli (from Sikkim) paste  one of the hottest chillies of the northeast known for its sting and flavour.Laal maas, which literally means red meat, is a traditional Rajasthani dish that combines royalty with hotness. Succulent pieces of lamb are cooked only with roasted dry red chillies (locally called tikha laal), pounded in desi ghee and fragrant whole spice mixture or khada masala. It isprepared in a huge handi by simmering for hours together, letting the spices penetrate the chunks of meat and allowing them to be perfectly cooked. It is indeed not for the faint-gutted! The Rajputs used to have this with makkai ki roti, but you could even try it with roomali rotis or jeera rice.This is a Spanish prawn dish cooked in a spicy peri peri sauce made from fiery red and ripe bird's eye chillies. The prawns are fried in olive oil with garlic and cloves and then cooked in the spicy sauce. It is served with Spanish seafood paella rice sauted with saffron to balance the hotness of the prawns."

However, in retail markets all vegetables are sold in the range of Rs 10-Rs 20 per kg,"" he maintained.Sethi said farmers' worst period started during demonetization when there was no cash flow in the market and they were forced to sell their produce at any price. ""Hoping to get the best price as had happened in the past year, farmers had brought a large portion of their fields under vegetable cultivation and also got bumper crop, but demonetization played the spoilsport. Now, with the glut of crops, the only hope now is to export vegetables to Pakistan, which is struggling with their supply,"" said president of association Ravinder Singh.Jamhuri Kisan Sabha president Satnam Singh Ajnala blamed the government for not fixing MSP for vegetables and its inability to set up vegetable-based agro industries in Punjab. ""Since there is no MSP, farmers are being exploited by commission agents and the government is not doing anything,"" he said, adding that the MSP of vegetables would at least ensure that farmers wouldn't be at loss. Besides, he opined that the government should have a dependable transportation network to immediately supply vegetables where there was a deficit."

But farmers now face a new challenge: washed-out roads that will make it difficult to get their crops to market.As harvesting time for tobacco, maize and other crops approaches, fears abound that roads made impassable by rain will not be repaired in time.Some farmers, particularly those growing fruit, already find themselves stuck with produce ready for market but no way to get it there.""There are no roads. They were washed away by the heavy rains,"" said Liberty Kuhudzai, a farmer in Chipendeke, about 70 kilometres south of the city of Mutare.""We have potatoes which are ready for the market but we can't take them. And soon, the maize and other crops will be ready for the market too,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.Chipendeke is one of the most vibrant small-scale farming areas in the province, in far eastern Zimbabwe. Farmers at the moment have potatoes, groundnuts, maize and various vegetables in the ground; in winter they grow wheat, beans, tomatoes and other vegetables.But their main market is in the city of Mutare, and their farming area is connected to the main Mutare-Masvingo highway by a gravel road that snakes along the treacherous edges of the Chitora River.Near Chipendeke Primary School, sections of the road are missing after heavy rain. In other areas, bridges are broken or what remains of the roads are muddy and slippery.""We have tried to repair the roads using our own resources but as soon as we finish the heavy rains come again and wash everything away,"" Kuhudzai said. ""We don't even know what to do. Without the road we are stuck.""LOSING 'A LOT OF MONEY'Catherine Nyakunuhwa, a banana farmer in Honde Valley, said the poor state of the roads meant some of her harvest was lost, affecting her business.""It's now taking too long for us to reach the market with our bananas and we are losing a lot of money. Right now most of my bananas could not reach the market because they rot before they were ferried,"" Nyakunuhwa said.""We are now appealing to the government to help us repair the roads,"" she said, as she sifted through a big basket of rotten bananas to see if any good ones remained. ""Farming is our only source of livelihood and we need good roads to take our crops to the market.""Nyakunuhwa said some farmers have lost more than $100 worth of bananas in a day - a lot of money by local standards.""It's a big loss,"" she said.Zimbabwe's Meteorological Services Department in late February said Manicaland was one the province that has received the heaviest rains - ""in some cases record-breaking rainfall,"" the agency noted.The situation has been made worse by Tropical Cyclone Dineo which hit some parts of the country at the end of February.EFFORTS TO REBUILDTransport and Infrastructural Development Minister Joram Gumbo said his ministry was working with the Ministry of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing to rehabilitate bad or dangerous roads in both urban and rural areas throughout the country.Responding to a question from Francis Mukwangwariwa, a member of parliament from Zvimba East constituency, Gumbo said on live television from Parliament earlier this month that the government needed $100 million to rebuild bridges and the road networks.Mukwangwariwa wanted to know the measures the government had put in place to repair roads and bridges washed away by heavy rain.""We are now in the tobacco selling season and people need to take their tobacco to the tobacco auction floors,"" Mukwangwariwa said.Gumbo said the Ministry of Finance had set aside $15 million to rebuild roads and was trying to acquire about $50 million in loans through the Zimbabwe National Road Authority.""This was done considering that farm produce will need to be taken to the market,"" he told Parliament.Gumbo later told journalists in Harare that major bridges had been affected by the heavy rains in a variety of provinces. In some of the areas, farmers and other residents have been using makeshift bridges to cross flooded rivers.Kuhudzai, the farmer from Chipendeke, however, said he was not convinced that the government would move fast enough to make repairs.""Do you think the government will start with our road?"" Kuhudzai asked. ""We pray so because we don't even know what to do.""

But supplies are falling even from this centuries-old Arabian sea route that is one of the last lifelines to a country on the brink of famine.A two-year-old civil war has severely restricted the flow of food into the main Yemeni cargo ports of Hodeidah and Salif on the Red Sea, where all the large grain silos are located.The small wooden boats sailing from souks in the UAE are moving small but vital supplies by making for the smaller ports to the south coast that are of little use to larger vessels - and often sidestepping military inspections that choke traffic by dropping anchor at secluded coves nearby.The deals originate in the sprawling Al Ras Market, a collection of dusty alleyways near the Dubai Creek where an array of food and spices are on display including colourful sacks of Pakistani and Indian rice.The dhows - plying the ancient trade route that once carried the likes of pearls, frankincense and myrrh - supply 14,000 to 18,000 tonnes of foodstuffs a month to Yemen, according to traders. That represents a drop of about 30-40 percent over the past year because of problems with payment, as well as adverse sailing conditions.""The Yemeni currency is destroyed, sometimes we can't get paid enough. We can only go once a month because the seas are too rough,"" said trader Mohammed Hassan, at a docking station at nearby Port Khaled in Sharjah""Sometimes we have to wait 40 days.""The volumes of food carried on this route represent a small fraction of the supply to Yemen, which relies on imports for 90 percent of its food. But it has become increasingly important as fighting has raged, the economy has collapsed and Yemen has needed all the help it can get.PORT DAMAGEThousands of people have been killed in the civil war pits the Iran-allied Houthi group against a Saudi-backed coalition - which includes the UAE - fighting to restore the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.The conflict has choked imports. Sixty percent of Yemenis, or 17 million people, are in ""crisis"" or ""emergency"" food situations, according to the United Nations.While vessels seeking access to Houthi-held areas must face inspections for smuggled weapons, the government-controlled south has less restrictions.Food imports into Hodeidah have fallen relentlessly, with only a few ships arriving each week - compared with dozens before the war - and more shipping lines pulling out due to the growing risks, according to aid and shipping sources.In recent weeks damage to infrastructure in the neighbouring port of Salif has also cut food deliveries, aid officials said.""The country is living on its reserves,"" said Robert Mardini, International Committee of the Red Cross regional director for the Near and Middle East in Geneva this week.""There is a lack of liquidity, no payment of salaries, which means that the spending power has collapsed and that the price of food is soaring whenever it is available.""'PAY THUGS'UAE-based dhow captains avoid these snarl-ups by steering clear of the big Red Sea ports and instead ply their trade to the south, often docking at informal inlets.The average journey takes about five to eight days, with the boats capable of taking up to 2,000 tonnes of goods, still small fry compared with cargo ships that could provide more relief to one of the poorest and most unstable countries in the world.Trader Ali Mahdani ships his goods out of Dubai to the southern Yemeni ports of Aden, Mukalla or Mokha, goods worth 4-6 million UAE dirhams ($1.1-1.6 million) per month, around 2,000 tonnes of mostly rice, spices or cooking oil. To avoid payments in the battered Yemeni currency he gets paid in Saudi riyals.There are few issues upon arrival. That's a sharp contrast the scrutiny that any vessels hoping to access the north would be subjected to as the Saudi-led coalition search for weapons which may be headed into Houthi hands.""You may have to pay thugs every once in a while but otherwise it is all good to go,"" said Mahdani, dressed in a flowing white robe.Trader Amin Baghersh ships powered milk, tomato paste, sugar and rice from Al Ras to Yemen, selling about one million UAE dirhams worth per month.He and others rely on hawala, an informal trading system through exchange houses based on trust and personal ties.Most of his goods make their way to Mukalla and Aden and surrounding areas. But he, like others, has taken a heavy hit from the Yemeni currency crisis and payment problems caused by the war.An Iranian trader had similar complaints.""I used to transfer about 2,000 tonnes of food a month,"" said the trader, who declined to give his name. ""In the last three or four months people asked me for supplies but I am reluctant to deal with them.""($1 = 3.6724 UAE dirham)(Additional reporting by Jonathan Saul in London and Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva; Editing by Pravin Char)"

Celebrated since 3,000 years, the festival occurs on the first day of the first month of the Fasli calender. For Mumbai's minuscule peace loving Zoroastrian community comprising 50,000 odd Parsis and Iranis, Navroze is celebrated with a lot of fervour.The numerous Parsi baugs dotted along the city come alive with the cheerful greetings of 'Navroze Mubarak' after which the faithful make a trip to the neighbourhood agiary or atash behram  most of them in south Mumbai  to pray and offer sandalwood to the holy fire that burns inside. The agiaries have been scrupulously cleaned in the days leading to Navroze and decorated with beautiful divas and fresh flowers. Some Zoroastrians have jasans  thanksgiving prayers performed by priests  at home while some make a trip to the Iranshah at Udwada  the holiest place of worship for Zoroastrians.Houses are spruced up, the most expensive China and fancy linen is brought out, colourful intricate rangoli is made at the entrance and colourful bead and glass torans are hung across thresholds. According to ancient customs, the Iranis lay down a special table, where the Khordeh Avesta (holy book) is placed along with a lamp or candle, sprouted wheat or beans, a bowl with a silver coin, flowers, sweets, rosewater, mirror and bowl of water. Seven food items beginning with 'sh' in Persian  wine, sugar, milk, sweet meat, honey, sweets and syrup  are placed along with fruits, dried fruits and nuts. Signifying prosperity, wealth and happiness among other things, the table is considered an auspicious part of celebrations.The highlight of the day, of course, is the food  no Parsi occasion is complete without a scrumptious meal. The day begins with the tempting aroma of frying vermicelli or sev in ghee with sugar, almonds, raisins and charoli. Some homes make the rava, which is white and has almonds and raisins on top. Breakfast also comprises the Parsi poro, an omelette of tomatoes, green chillies, onions, kothmir or the akuri, which is scrambled. Lunch could be Sali Boti, Dhan Dal Patia or Mutton Dhansak. Dessert is jalebi, sutarfeni, falooda or kulfi.After the indispensable afternoon siesta, it is time to host a get-together at home, meet old friends at the Parsi Gymkhana or spend the evening watching a play or the latest movie, followed by dinner at a fancy restaurant. While the naataks are nowhere as popular as they used to be during the time of the late Adi Marzban , known for his outrageous Gujarati plays, there are still plenty of other choices. Navroze Mubarak to all!"

While Msquared of Technopark now has a plot filled with various fruit trees and vegetables, UST Global of Infopark and Prakruti group of Trivandrum have been into in-campus vegetable farming for the past few months. Kochi Times takes a walk down these IT campusesThe employees of UST Global, Kochi, took up farming on campus as a means to break out of the home-work-home rut. Dipin Varghese, who coordinates the farming activities in the company, says, ""In order to engage in something else other than just work, we had started an online offshoot of the Ernakulam Public Library in our office eight months ago. The library also had a krishi club. Inspired by the same, one of our farming enthusiast employees, Srinath, asked why can't we too start a vegetable garden in our campus.""Many other employees were also interested in the same and the techies decided to try their hand at cultivation. They earmarked about 20 cents of land in a plot near their office. ""We grew only peas and ladies finger at this phase and hardly knew anything about farming, but produced veggies costing nearly `12,000! We sold it off in the campus around the time of Onam and also took a handful, home! That was a huge motivation to continue with it,"" says Akash Viswom, another techie-farmer.Similarly, the employees of Msquared in Technopark, Trivandrum, started farming after seeing the success of farming on a land near their Ranni office. ""Inspired by the same, we decided to devote a little time and identified about 30 cents for cultivation on our Trivandrum campus,"" says Jinu Jose, CEO of the company, pointing at the farm which is now full of fruit trees.Prakruti, a group of green enthusiasts in Technopark, has also been into in-campus cultivation on 15 cents of land for the past two months. ""We tried farming on a land near to the campus first, and the success motivated us. Our farm has veggies like bottle gourd, bitter gourd, brinjal and more growing well, now,"" says Biju Sundaran of the group.All of these techies spend a major chunk of their time in their workplace, but that doesn't stop them from taking out some time to take care of their garden. Biju says, ""We take turns to water and weed the saplings in the mornings and evenings, and also during the break time. Sometimes, we also drop in during weekends to tend to the plants.""As for the UST Global folks, they had to turn the rocky terrain into fertile land, all by themselves! Lekha Chandran from the company says, ""That did not deter our spirit. From a plot of land nearby, we gathered enough of soil and levelled the area, all by ourselves. We also filled growbags with soil and cow dung on our own and planted some saplings. This time, we graduated to five vegetables - peas, tomato, ladies finger, broad beans, green chili and brinjal. And what's more, many of us also started cultivation at our homes, alongside!"" The saplings have just started growing and the joy of watching it is something else and also a stress buster, say these techies.These techies ensure that they use only organic manure in their farms. Dipin of UST says, ""We have bought cow dung from local farmers and as the next step, we are trying to set up a waste water treatment facility using water from our cafeterias."" The cultivators of Prakruti are also preparing pesticides on their own, mixing green leaves and cow dung. The techies also take training from various governments agricultural services, to sharpen their farming skills."

The NRDC said on Tuesday it was evaluating the next steps in its legal fight.Government scientists said the delay, part of a standard review, was not expected to affect the insect's conservation, Interior Department spokeswoman Heather Swift said in a statement on Tuesday.The agency ""will work with stakeholders to ensure collaborative conservation among landowners, farmers, industry, and developers in the areas where the species is native,"" she added.Bumble bees pollinate wildflowers and about a third of U.S. crops, according to the Xerces Society. A recent study by the Center for Biological Diversity found that more than 700 of the 4,000 bee species native to North America and Hawaii may be inching toward extinction.

Styled much like a British gentlemans club, it is situated on the ground level at Peninsula Redpine Hotel in the busy neighbourhood of Marol, which straddles the commercial with the residential.Its pretty much mandatory to go thirsty to a cocktail tasting, especially one that requires you to stir, shake, and get down to the dirty. We are at The Stables to attend a masterclass conducted by the bars mixologists. The bar/pub is is all done up in dark wood, and antique style with eye-catching chandeliers. Photographs of famous horses like The Secretariat dot the walls along with trivia, some examples of which are: Did you know the Seattle Slew had a habit of tiptoeing before a race, a move that came to be known as the war dance, and The Secretariat had a heart, two-and-a-half-times the size of a normal horse.Mixologist James Birch, who has come from the bars Dubai outpost, begins the workshop with two cocktails. The first one is Wind Suck (Rs. 400), a vodka-based drink, with fresh cucumber, lemon juice, honey, orange juice and lemonade. It is cool, refreshing and has a prominent kick (pun-intended). Wind Suck is so named as it is what the horse does when it is happy. It sucks in wind, he says, taking another empty glass to stir Stables Grog (Rs. 300), a drink named after Franky, a famous jockey. He is an ex-Godolphine club member, one of the biggest derby clubs in the world, owned by the Sheikh of Dubai. He once requested for a rum-based drink, which he grogged in under two minutes! exclaims Birch.Play on the palateNext up is mixologist Stephan Jovanovic who whips up the Oscar sangria named after yet another award-winning derby horse. The bright blue drink has a mash-up of Merlot martini, brandy, gin and orange curaao. While the backstory and ingredients sound promising, we dont like the drink for its jumbled mess it creates on our palate, its just too dry and sour. We pay keener attention to the last drink, Cribber Ascot (Rs. 450) made with white rum, dark rum, orange curaao, orange juice, lemon juice, grenadine syrup  all of which has a smoother play on the palate.Experts Birch and Jovanovic are done showing us their skills and it is time for us to try our hand at making Stables Grog. It isnt easy as it looks  we throw in Jamaican rums, pineapple juice, lemon juice, passion syrup and Angostura bitters, topping up the mixing glass with crushed ice and give it a good shake.But shaking cocktails is hard work and we discover that we need some sustenance, which comes in the form of the perennially busy popcorn machine; Loaded Nachos (Rs. 300), guacamole, sour cream, beans and cheese, and crisp potato skins (Rs. 300) topped with cheesy. The Portobello Mushroom Burger (Rs. 325) has marinated button mushrooms and tangy tomatoes sans a patty with freshly baked bun. Highway 55 (Rs. 400) is a wholesome, cheesy baguette sandwich with pork loin, with onions and mushrooms. The BBQ chicken pizza (Rs. 450) has juicy strips of grilled chicken and sweetened red onions.Since we are not indulging in a full menu tasting, and are concentrating on the drinks, we must mention the Smooth Mouth (Rs. 700), which looks like a cold coffee. We are not fans of milk-based drinks, solely because a shoddy rendition can ruin the night. We eye this one with contempt, though one sip and we claim it a stunner: its loaded with vodka, Amaretto, Baileys, Kahlua, brandy, orange curaao, milk and fresh cream. The comfort of Amaretto, the citrus punch from orange and the creamy Bailey makes it a comforting drink likely to get repeat orders. Dessert is a wholesome brownie (Rs. 399), drizzled with a thick, caramelised toffee sauce, with a vanilla scoop melting alongside its warm companions.The Stables, Peninsula Redpine Hotel, Andheri East; 40912345"

Here, you will find visitors slipping token into vending machines to collect boxes of their 'pret-a-prasadam', prepared with precision in the automated temple kitchen.K Sri Sridhar, a herbal oncologist who helped set up the temple, says his idea to serve up desserts and sandwiches as part of the temple prasadam has rustled up quite a bit of interest among locals and tourists. ""The idea was to show that anything that is nutritious and prepared in a clean kitchen with a clean mind can be served to God. It doesn't have to be only traditional dishes,"" says Sridhar.A few months ago, the temple even introduced the 'birthday cake prasadam' for its devotees. ""We maintain a computerised register of their birth dates and addresses and door deliver a cake prasadam to them. It's a hit among the elderly devotees, because coming from the temple it adds a special touch to the occasion,"" says Sridhar.On Saturday, for instance, 81-year-old Subbulakshmi was more than pleasantly surprised when she received a cake prasadam. ""It was so pretty with flowers and icing,"" says the 81-year-old, adding it was her first surprise cake ever. ""And it came with an agar deepam (a traditional oil lamp) instead of candles which was so nice. Just like they light at the temple,"" she adds.

In a statement in the assembly, Maharathy said favourable weather conditions had helped tomato production in the district to go up, resulting in a fall in prices. Quoting the wholesale price index, he said nationally the price of vegetables was lower than that of last year.The minister, however, was silent on setting up of infrastructure, particularly cold storages, a factor widely seen responsible for the distress sale of vegetables across the state. Official sources said Keonjhar has only one cold storage facility with a capacity of 5,000 tonne.Maharathy said Keonjhar district collector N Thirumala Naik visited certain tomato growing villages and initiated discussion on setting up of a committee through which farmers could sell vegetables directly to retailers. The minister claimed he has also instructed authorities of the integrated tribal development agency (ITDA) to ensure purchase of tomatoes directly from the growers for residential schools. ""Due to the intervention of the administration, local traders have been buying tomatoes directly from farmers since March 3 at Rs 120 per crate,"" he said.The farmers' wing of the BJP, which organised a massive protest here during the day, was far from impressed with the minister's statement.

In return, I get satisfaction,"" Shobha said.Krishna's rooftop garden spreads across 5,000sqft, which she had reared with equal love and dedication for the past eight years.""Earlier I used to grow flowers like roses, sunflowers and petunia in small pots.

Farmers hurled the tomato harvest to the ground, demanding access to cold storage facilities and compensation for losses.Later, they submitted a memorandum to the additional district magistrate, Sangram Keshari Swain . ""We have received their demand letter and have asked the horticulture department for an inquiry. We will take necessary steps after we get the report,"" said Swain.Farmers alleged that they have been unable to sell their produce and have not been able to store them either, without cold storage facilities. Most of them had taken loans from different banks and SHG groups and have not been able to repay them, as a result. ""While earlier, traders from Sambalpur, Rourkela and Khurdha procured tomatoes to avoid distress sales by farmers, after the intervention of district administration, this year no agencies have done that,"" said farmer, Debabrata Mohanta.While the rate of tomatoes per 30 kilograms is about Rs 30, the plucking wage is about Rs 10 per 30 kilos. ""Hence, we could not engage labour to pluck the tomatoes as there is no market to sale. Tomato on acres of land is gradually rotting,"" Debabrata said.Processing units like Bilati Orissa Limited used to procure the major bulk of tomatoes earlier for production of sauce. Problems started after the closure of the firm.Worst affected are farmers from villages like Mahadeijoda, Tikarpada, Salarapenth, Naupada and Dalimapur, which cater to the district's vegetable market.""If the tomatoes could be stored now then they could be saved and after about one month, we could get their value. But there is no cold storage here to store vegetables and other products,"" said farmer Sarat Mohanta of Mahadeijoda.""We are making an investigation on the quantities of production and the causes of distress sale. Due to favourable climate all over the state, no one has been coming to these villages to buy tomatoes,"" said the Keonjhar deputy director of horticulture, Ranjan Kumar Das Mohapatra . ""Farmers can process the tomatoes by setting up a small scale processing unit with an investment of Rs 2 lakh. We can provide technical support if they need. They can preserve the extract of tomatoes for weeks this way,"" Mohapatra added."

As local harvest of vegetables including tomatoes, chilli, lemon, coriander and bottle gourd is likely to go down, prices are likely to shoot up. Prices of vegetables are all time cheap since January due to extremely good local harvest. However, wholesale traders are expecting scarcity of vegetables as local harvest gets exhausted from March.Presently, homemakers are enjoying vegetable shopping as prices remained cheaper in January and February. Tomatoes in wholesale are priced at Rs 5 to Rs 10 per kg where as it is selling at Rs 10 to Rs 15 per kg in retail market.

Water hyacinth has covered the river on both sides of the weir. Thousands of fish have died in the river and can be seen upon moving the hyacinth. A foul smell persists in the area.Indrayani river flows along the northern boundary of Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits. In 1997, Talawade, Chikhli, Moshi, Charholi and Dudulgaon, located by Indrayani river, along with another 13 villages were merged into the municipal corporation limits.82-year-old farmer Govind Saste , who owns an agricultural plot near the weir in Moshi, said, ""Earlier, the river was so clean that we would drink the water and swim in it but the water started getting polluted about 10 years ago. The crop yield has reduced by 20% due to the polluted water. Tomatoes and brinjals drop from the plants before maturity and cauliflower does not grow to full potential, reducing the yield.""According to farmers in the area, the groundwater in areas up to 1,200 feet from the river has become polluted and borewells have also been affected in Moshi. Another farmer Raju Saste, who lives in the vicinity, said, ""We get drinking water from PCMC but the animals drink the water from the river when they are brought here for grazing. The water makes them ill.""Changdev Kudale, a farmer from the village, pointed out, ""Motors of pumps supplying water to the fields are located in the riverbed. We have suffered from skin rashes after we enter the river to use the pumps,"" he added.Speaking to TOI, assistant commissioner and Zone E officer of PCMC Chandrakant Indalkar said, ""We regularly remove the water hyacinth but it grows back. The health department will invite bids to allot a contract to remove water hyacinth from Indrayani river soon."" The bids could not be invited earlier due to the election code of conduct.A civic health official said, ""The domestic untreated sewage released into the river provides an ideal environment for fast growth of water hyacinth. The chemicals released through untreated industry effluents has caused the death of fish.""Sandeep Alhat, a resident of Laxminagar in Moshi said, ""We stay around half a kilometer from the river but still have to face mosquito menace due to the rampant growth of water hyacinth in the river after the end of rainy season. People who go to switch on or off the motors of water pumps in the riverbed for watering their adjacent fields have to face problems of itching and boils after they come out of the polluted water."""

The rising temperature has been affecting the flowering process of vegetables and has brought the state's production down by 50% this season, said sources from Vegetable Growers Association of India The situation is particularly worrisome in Pune, Nashik, Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur that are known to be major vegetable growing areas.Shriram Gadhave, president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India, told TOI that vegetables that are in the flowering stage have been adversely affected by the recent heatwave and the ongoing temperature conditions in parts of Maharashtra. ""The yield of all vegetables has dipped by 50% due to the current weather conditions. The high heat burns the flowers that are meant to fruit later,"" said Gadhave.He added that leafy greens, beans, tomatoes, cauliflower, pointed gourd and cucumbers, among others, have been affected. Narendra Pawar , who heads a farmer producer company with 2,500 vegetable growers from Pune, Satara and Ahmednagar, said that major vegetable growing districts -Nashik and Pune - have been most-affected. ""Water shortage and increasing temperature prevent the vegetable flowers from fruiting, resulting in a 30% to 40% drop in production and supply into markets across Maharashtra. The heat has not only been turning the leaves of vegetable black but is also hampering the growth of plants,"" he said.According to Gadhave, the high temperature conditions seem to be more conspicuous this year and the major vegetable growing belt in west Maharashtra has been affected the most. ""Though the area cultivating vegetables in Maharashtra is huge, production has not been up to the mark this season due to the sudden spike in mercury during the latter half of March and in April. Marathwada and Vidarbha are also reeling under high temperatures but the area cultivating vegetables in these regions is comparatively lesser than Pune, Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur and Nashik districts.""Meanwhile, Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) sources added that this is the hottest of several summers in the recent past and the increasing heat has already dented the supply of vegetables into Pune's wholesale market by 40%.An APMC official affirmed that vegetable supply in the wholesale market has dipped off late. ""It is not that vegetables deteriorate after arriving in the market; they are rotting in fields due to exposure to high temperature. Almost 40% of the vegetables are destroyed on the field itself owing to the heat,"" the official said.A senior official from Maharashtra's commissionerate of agriculture (horticulture) said that the shortage of water in such regions coupled with the high heat hampers the fruit-bearing process in plants, leading to a dip in production."

A few vegetables are selling at more than Rs 80 per kg in some areas.Vegetable supply in the local market, meanwhile, has dropped since March first week owing to summer setting in and shortage of water in vegetable producing regions in the state, said sources in Pune Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC).Retail prices of vegetables have gone up in tandem with wholesale prices, though the increase in latter has been less than the retail prices.A senior APMC official told TOI that the rise in wholesale prices of vegetables has been between 15% and 20% during the last few days.

""High temperature during the day, followed by chilly night temperature affects the growth and quality of leafy greens like fenugreek, coriander, spinach and even cluster beans.

Ganesh , 38, one of the farmers at Periya Muthaali village where the wall broke, said, ""The side wall of the canal of Kelavarapalli dam had broken many a times. This time, the range of loss is high as the floodwater submerged around 100 acres of fertile land,"" he said.Another farmer S Manjunath , 34, said farmers have faced huge loss due to negligence on the part of public works department (PWD). ""The right side of the canal wall had been broken a year ago. At the time, the PWD officials simply placed sand bags instead of constructing a new wall,"" he said.

The health benefit of preparing food in earthen pots was known to our ancestors, and has been an intrinsic part of the Indian kitchen. However, the tradition vanished with the arrival of steel and aluminum vessels.The canteen, in business for about 15 years now, started using earthen pot only four months ago. They serve palav for Rs 40, which includes more leafy green vegetables and rice. Healthy seeds, dry fruits, ghee, pickle and curd give the food an original taste. ""We use 35 healthy ingredients in the palav. People who are health conscious come here for their meal,"" said Narayan, the cook at the canteen.Ganesh, a customer, said, ""I have food here every day. From my experience, I bet no expensive food matches the health benefits available here. Many people think that paying more gives you healthier food, it's not so. We should prepare such food at home too, and include rural medicinal plants which are ignored.""On the health benefit of clay pots, Dr Chandra Shekhar Aithal from Udupi said, ""Clay has a porous quality. While cooking, heat and moisture circulate through the pot, unlike in metal or enamel-lined pots. Most pots are made with micaceous clay (clay containing mica flecks), which acts as a natural insulator. The speciality of these pots is that the clay is alkaline based, hence it interacts with acidity in the food, neutralizing the pH balance. Cooking in clay pots gives you calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, sulphur and several other compounds that benefit our body. It has the power to control diabetes and blood pressure.""The original Udupi fish curry is prepared in clay pots in villages. Shankari, 67, from Nellikatte, Udupi, said this fish curry can be had for three days without it spoiling. In fact, as it matures, the taste improves, and it just needs to be heated every day.""Making rice in clay pots is difficult because it should be handled with care, but curry can be made easily. I love dishes prepared in pots. These pots are naturally very acidic; hence when we cook tomato in it, it gets a natural sweetness,"" said Shankari."

The market itself is barely spread over a few acres of land and the storage facilities are extremely primitive,"" K Ayappa, a wholesale dealer from the market said.""We cannot operate beyond a particular volume on a daily basis and are forced to reject stock as the storage facilities are virtually non-existent.

Bananas do not have much shelf life like most fruits. However, there is no way of storing it. The sheds and buildings are in deplorable conditions.

""Let the government build a modern multi-tiered refrigerated storage facility for high-end fruits and vegetables. The traders can ensure that they are available over an extended period of time, handle more volumes and reduce the price. Products such as potatoes, tomatoes and even mangoes can be sold better this way. Maybe in the short run, the expenses will be high.

In spite of heavy rains and a spurt in farm productivity, the scourge of suicides continues to spread. The highest number of suicides was in Beed (23), hometown of rural minister Pankaja Munde, followed by Nanded (22), Osmanabad (19), Aurangabad (18), Jalna (14), Parbhani and Hingoli (8 each) and Latur (5). Of the 117 cases, financial aid was provided to 46 families of the deceased. But 13 were denied relief and 58 proposals are still being processed.Head of a state-level task force on farmer welfare, Kishore Tiwari, said while the government had taken various measures, the results were not visible. ""We'll have to redraft our strategy to halt farmer suicides,"" Tiwari said. ""We will have to provide remunerative prices for agriculture produce, along with market intervention. A plan needs to be worked out to provide education to farmers' children and financial assistance for healthcare.""In 2016, production of tur, tomato, onion and most vegetables doubled and even tripled but farm gate prices dipped. Onion was sold for Rs 460 per quintal as against the production cost of Rs 950. Tur farmers were paid less than the minimum support price (MSP) in wholesale markets. The MSP for tur was Rs 5,050 and traders were purchasing it at Rs 4200-4400 per quintal.However, a comparison with figures for the previous year show a marginal decline in toll. According to data, 3,052 farmers ended their lives in 2016, of which 1,053 cases were from Aurangabad, which falls in Marathwada region. The 117 cases recorded in 2017, if seen against the average bi-monthly rate for the previous year, indicates a slight downturn. Incidentally, the same trend is visible for 2015 and 2016. Against a total of 3,052 farmers who killed themselves in 2016, the toll was higher at 3,228 in 2015, which was a drought year.Leader of opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil said over the last two and half years, 9,000 farmers have killed themselves. ""We demand that Fadnavis declare a total loan waiver to protect the farmers' lives."" Patil led an opposition delegation recently which called on Governor Vidyasagar Rao to press for their demand."

What happened in the panchayat polls in 2015 when the BJP was wiped out will be repeated in the Assembly polls, Mr. Patel told The Hindu in an interview.According to him, the ruling BJP will pay a heavy price for the excesses during the agitation in which a dozen persons were killed in police firing and women beaten up. A dozen people were killed in police firing. We were sent to jail on sedition charge. Police thrashed our women in our own homes.

Like the rest of India, here in Jewar, , despite a good harvest, there are no takers for the produce.Distraught farmers blame the market meltdown on demonetisation . There's a glut, but procurement prices have crashed over the last two months. With cash flow still disrupted, farmers are selling at throw-away rates.Local vendors on carts and at roadside stalls are selling vegetables at Rs 5-8 per kg. ""What we are picking up from farmers is selling very slowly. People are not buying much. Most farmers are selling produce at Rs 1-2 per kg,"" said Baleshwar, a middleman.

He has tomatoes, potatoes, carrots and seasonal fruits on his cart. Over a week, he expected to sell the potatoes at Rs 7/kg and carrots at Rs 10/kg, giving him an average profit of Rs 2/kg of vegetables sold, and an overall profit of Rs 300-500.Some farmers claimed the crash will continue affecting them for several months, as winter is when they make a clean profit, which helps them tide over the year's uncertainties.""We're ruined.

You tend to hear about IT companies that grow and sell their own vegetables. Sasken Technologies , a Dolmur-based company, has converted a barren piece of land into an organic kitchen garden. There's cabbage, spinach, tomato, sweet corn, okra, beans, carrot, beetroot, radish, bitter gourd, and coriander, among various others veggies to pick from. Depending on the harvest, once (sometimes, twice) a week, there is a vegetable 'mandi' inside the premises where employees can buy the fresh produce at a discount. At this two-decade-old IT firm, this has become a practice for the last three months.The idea towards greener initiative came when the company found that a 4-acre land adjacent to its office (owned by Sasken itself) wasn't being utilised completely. ""A cricket and basketball ground was in use, but an acre was vacant. Our CEO (Rajiv Mody) suggested that we do something to make it greener. By and by, we decided that we would use it to cultivate something,"" says Sunil Dath , Head-Facility Management and IT Operations.Once the idea took shape, they started cleaning up the area, sent the soil for testing to a laboratory to check the pH value to determine the kind of vegetables that could be grown, after which they started planting carrots, beetroots, spinach, corn, etc.While the produce was initially given to the employees complimentary, it is now being sold at 20 per cent less than the market rate (they have a tie-up with HOPCOMS to help them determine the rate of the vegetables on the day of the mini-market), and the money received is pumped back into buying seeds, manure, setting up a rainwater harvesting plant. In fact, for this initiative, they've specifically employed two gardeners to manage the area. This is in addition to an existing five-member gardening team.""The produce is completely organic. We don't use any chemicals or pesticides. We use sheep manure instead,"" Dath says.When the initiative was announced, employees themselves were apprehensive as to whether they would be able to pull it off. ""The manpower, the quality, whether we'd be able to grow it without pesticides - these were the questions being asked. But this initiative has proven that we have been able to channelise a vacant land into something meaningful, for employees and the environment,"" says Anees Haidary Senior Manager, Business Excellence.""What I've noticed is that the spinach I buy here remains fresh up to a week because it's organic. The regular greens available in the market don't last more than two days. And 30-40 per cent of my vegetable shopping has come down since,"" he says.The market has inspired Haidary to grow his own vegetables. ""Six weeks ago, I replanted the spinach and use the crop that's grown at home,"" he says.Agrees Indira Kuppathil, Manager-Sales Operations, Business Operations has started growing vegetables in a small patch of land at her house. ""I don't throw away any peels. I've started growing beans and dhaniya. This took off from the initiative at office. And it's also pushed me towards going organic,"" she says.Employees have started connecting with nature. They are often seen heading towards the garden to see the progress of the vegetables. ""Day-to-day stress is high. An environment-friendly initiative like this acts as a great stress-buster,"" says S Patil, Assistant Manager, Facility Management."

Wholesale traders noted that the market received only 220 truckloads of vegetables against its daily share of 300 lorries on Monday. This had led to short supply of vegetables such as carrot, brinjal, beans and beetroot.Lorries mainly from southern parts of the State refrained from transporting goods even though the Tamil Nadu State Lorry Owners Federation had announced that essential goods supply would not be affected. Dry weather and drought conditions in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka were also cited to be another reason for the steady increase in the cost of some vegetables.P.Sukumar, joint secretary, Koyambedu Fruits, Flowers and Vegetables Market, said on Monday, some vegetables, including cabbage, carrot, beans and broad beans were costlier by 25% than last week due to short supply. Vegetables such as brinjal and carrot were priced between Rs. 30-Rs. 40 a kg. The prices doubled in the initial two days of the strike as residents bought more to stock owing to strike. However, prices of onion, tomato and potato remain stable. They are sold at less than Rs. 25 a kg in wholesale market as most of the stock is procured from Maharashtra and other parts of north India. Meanwhile, about 200 traders participated in a demonstration in support of the farmers demands for loan waiver and drought relief fund."

They struggle without water if monsoon gets delayed or the storage in water bodies dwindles From Cauvery to Palar and Bhavani to Mullaperiyar, every inter-state river is caught in legal battles in the apex court. This, coupled with a severe drought across the state in 2016 leading to crops drying up, has left a majority of farmers in debt. The food grain production in the state is expected to drop by at least 30% this year, compared to 130 million tonnes last year.After complete failure of the South-West and North-East monsoons last year, most districts reported fall in area under cultivation of both agriculture and horticulture crops.Experts say standard measures like improving water efficiency and staying away from water intensive crops, especially during rabisummer season should be looked into. Drip irrigation, rain water harvesting and creation of water bodies and desilting existing ones need to be taken up on a war footing. Farmers have a collective role in pond conservation, especially deepening ponds with the provision to cover the top to reduce loss due to evaporation.Farmers stress on the need for institutions to come up with more drought-resistant high-yielding varieties.At least 50 new varieties of seeds are released across crops by private companies and educational institutions every year.But farmers say 70% of them fail on the field. ""Institutions and companies, when marketing new varieties or hybrid seeds, promise high yield which they claim they got during the three-year trials,"" said president of Tamil Nadu Farmers' Association, A Kandasamy. ""But often, after the first year, the yield starts dropping, or they become susceptible to weather changes and pests,"" he said.Farmers quote the example of the CO1variety of tomato, released around four decades ago, which initially gave high yields but failed later. ""The CO1, which they said gives 25 tonnes per hectare, did give that much initially, but was found to be susceptible to heavy rains. The yield also dropped after four years,"" said Kandasamy .""All new varieties and hybrids force us to buy new seeds every time, spending Rs 10,000 per hectare. If we use the seeds from our crop, yield falls sharply,"" said an Avinashi-based organic farmer, G Ramasamy ."

The farmers also transport their own goods to avoid paying for transportation.Sadanand Mishra, one of the farmers who dumped his stock said, ""Most of us have to travel several kilometres on cycles, carrying more than a hundred kilograms of tomatoes and after reaching there we get even less than Rs 50 for a hundred kilos. Receiving so little after toiling on the farm for months is quite discouraging. As labourers we can earn at least Rs 200 per day.""Farmers claim that a defunct cold storage facility in Uldi and the government's inability to intervene is the reason to blame.Nitin Madan Kulkarni, secretary of the agricultural department said, ""The government is taking measures to set up processing plants and cold storages, but it will take time. The farmers usually send their stock for sale in vegetable markets in West Bengal but this time they have been unable to do so. There is no Minimum Support Price (MSP) for vegetables, so we cannot help the situation.""On being asked why the storage facility in Uldi is dysfunctional, he said, ""There were around ten storage facilities started by the Welfare Department which are all dysfunctional. The situation is not in our hands.""The situation that has been created near Bundu is similar to the scenario in Lohardaga district, where farmers have been forced to dump their produce a fortnight ago."

And this is only a conservative figure coming from the government. If one goes by the figures provided by farmers' associations, the number would swell to 6-7 suicides per day. The record heat and drought of 2017 could spell disaster for the farming community in the state, which has already seen 848 suicides in 2016-17, until February.Karnataka witnessed a record 1,478 suicides in 2015-16 due to severe shortage of rainfall, which put farmers in distress. They were unable to get desired prices for their produce and were neck-deep in debt with nationalised banks and private moneylenders. Regardless of what political parties may have said, the disturbing trend has proved beyond doubt that agriculture is no more a profitable venture.Getting back to governance after a fortnight full of bypoll politics, the Siddaramaiah government has a daunting task at hand of maintaining stability in the face of a severe drought. Even though the state government is trying to make agriculture profitable, estimates by the Karnataka State Agriculture Prices Commission indicate that it's far from so.The North Karnataka districts witnessed the highest suicides last year. This year, the cloud has moved over to the Malnad areas as several reservoirs here are dry since the monsoon failed and the groundwater plummeted.While Haveri district has topped the list with 86 suicides, Dharwad district witnessed 73. The coffee-growing district of Chikka-magaluru saw 70 suicides, followed by Mysuru and Mandya with 50 and 51 suicides, respectively. Both Mysuru and Mandya depend on Cauvery River for agriculture.Four consecutive years of drought are already weighing down on Karnataka's farmers. And now, reckless use of groundwater to compensate for the poor monsoon has only made things worse for them. The state budget, which made no mention of a loan-waiver, came as a huge disappointment for them.Kuruburu Shanthakumar, president of the sugarcane growers association, said: ""The government should have planned to prevent suicides. It failed to learn from last year's mistakes and the result is that even this year, there have been suicides. In less than one-and-a -half-years, as per our estimate, close to 3,000 farmers have committed suicide across Karnataka. Our only demand is that the government must stop loan recovery and waive off the loan. Shivanna (52) of Mandya district committed suicide when bank authorities slapped notices on him for the repayment of a loan of Rs 5 lakh. His entire paddy crop had perished as there was no water in the Cauvery basin this year.""While Siddaramaiah has made it clear that the Centre should waive the loan, farmers have a different understanding of the logic. ""If he (the CM) can give others, why can't he give to us? The CM claims that he cannot waive off the loan, but he has money to appoint a pay commission to revise the salaries of state government employees, which runs into several crores. If the exchequer is short of money, what was the reason for the government to procure new vehicles for presidents of zilla panchayat and taluk panchayat? What was binding on the government to increase the salary of MLAs, MLCs and ministers? Farmers and agriculture are not a priority for this government and it has been proved time and again,"" said Shanthakumar.Besides estimating that growing several crops would actually leave a farmer in loss, the Karnataka Agriculture Price Commission has attributed the continuing trend of farmer suicides to demonetisation and unscientific cropping pattern.TN Prakash Kammaradi, chairman of the com-mi-ssion, said: ""Demo-ne-tisation has literally taken money out of markets. Because of this, there is no purchase of produce in the market. When there is no purchase in market, how can you ensure profit for farmers?""""The centre should have been more proactive in this regard rather than leaving things entirely to the states. Instead, it is going in for zero duty import of pulses and sugar, which will be detrimental to our farmers.""Rather than importing, the same money should have been diverted and given to farmers as a minimum support price (MSP). Centre's policies are driven by inflation and consumer interests rather than to benefit farmers,"" he said.Prakash also opined that the unscientific cropping pattern and season-bound production of crops has also resulted in severe losses.""In some regions, farmers take to the cultivation of just one crop, resulting in excess production and fall in prices. Under favourable conditions, all farmers in Kalaburagi go after tur dal or farmers in Kolar flood the market with tonnes of tomatoes. We need to have a proper cropping plan and farmers have to stick to such rules to get effective prices for their produce,"" he said.Considering the market fluctuation until December 2016, the Karnataka Agriculture Price Commission has estimated loss and profit per acre for cultivation of each crop across Karnataka. As per the report, cultivating several staple crops would actually result in losses for farmers.Even though a few crops bring in profits, it would be insignificant. Cultivating several crops such as paddy, ragi (finger millet), foxtail millet, urad dal, sunflower, and coconut has only caused losses."

BHP, was still assessing the extent of any disruption to shipments.Queensland's top insurers, Suncorp Group Ltd and RACQ, said it was too early to put a dollar figure on the damage.Severe damage has been inflicted on vegetable and fruit crops in the Bowen and Mackay areas, with potential harm to this year's sugar crop which was due to be harvested in about six weeks' time.The wide region impacted by the cyclone contributes over A$1 billion of agricultural production annually, providing about 95 percent of Australia's winter supply of tomatoes and capsicums, said John Peters, senior economist at Commonwealth Bank.Tourism is another area that has taken a big hit from Debbie, with damage to popular resorts particularly in Whitsundays island which alone accounts for about 10 percent of Australia's tourism earnings.While a lower GDP will not be welcomed by the Reserve Bank of Australia, it is likely to look through the volatility in the data when setting policy rates. It holds its next policy meeting on April 4.The deleterious impact of the cyclone will likely be short-term with rebuilding and repair activity expected to prop up economic growth in coming months, economists said.""The State, Federal and local governments will rebuild damaged rail, roads, buildings and bridges,"" Peters said.""The private sector will also rebuild the port facilities, marinas, and tourism areas.

""Farmers come there to auction their produce to sellers from Koyambedu. Sellers in turn sell it to other wholesale dealers in Chennai in bulk boxes like 200, 100 and 50. These dealers in turn distribute to warehouses or retail shops, who in sell it to the customer. On average the produce changes hands six times and becomes that much more expensive for customers and farmers, who have to pay a commission to truck loaders,"" said Rajamohan.With E-Vegetailing middlemen are eliminated and farmers can get the full market price for their products.""We have to pay a 10% commission to truckers who pick up our goods. Going online has helped our goods fetch better prices at zero commission,"" Palaniswamy said.Another differentiater is the startup's revenue model.""We don't charge the farmers, we charge only the customers.

Made of upcycled, recycled and economised paper and other materials, it has the seed of an Agasthya (Sesbania grandiflora) tree at its bottom end. On World Environment Day 2016, the pens were handed out to a group of school children in the State who have also been using the pen.The Ganesh Chathurthi festival is always a nightmare for environmental activists owing to its aftermath - large numbers of paper mache 'Ganeshas' in the waterbodies.Last year, however, several groups across the country made news, for giving a twist to the popular Ganapathy idols. Instead of using environmentally hazardous materials for the idols which in turn pollute the water bodies they are immersed into, the new Ganapathy was way cooler and 'pregnant' with something useful and helpful for the environment. Termed Tree Ganesha or Green Ganesha, the idols were eco-friendly, made of red soil and organic fertilisers, with seeds as its base. Even when you aren't planning to immerse the idol, you can use water to disintegrate the Ganesha, which would turn into soil that nurtures the seeds.Pencils made of wood or plastic might soon be a thing of the past, if these ec-friendly pencils win more of hearts. Made from used newspapers, the pencils, called Eco-Me was launched last year in Coimbatore by an environment enthusiast. They are made of old newspapers and chemical-free, waterproof glue and are thus safe for kids, who use it like any normal pencil.No, we aren't talking about the commonly used rudraksha chain, but a variety of pretty neck pieces and bangles made by a group in Trichy. The necklaces, anklets and earrings are made by stringing together rice kernels, various medicinal plants, coral tree seeds and canna seeds. The seeds used are not poisonous or perishable, and belong to the widely available category of seeds, consciously avoiding the endangered varieties."

That has been the temple town's calling card and commerce. But foodies know that Varanasi's crowded streets and bylanes are also avenues of gastronomic delights. Many famous hawkers appear with their pushcarts in the evening. Some don't even have a signboard. Hygiene isn't their forte. But their offerings -- golgappas, rasedar pakoras, lassi - are addictive and available at a price that would buy you only a snigger in a city like Delhi.Quality street food, to anybody who pursues it like an obsessive lover, isn't just about feeling good. The best snacks take you into an unchartered zone where the taste buds groan with delight. It's like discovering an unknown erogenous zone. In their own way, the street-side hawkers of Varanasi are everyday artists in the business of producing and peddling pleasure.You might get that kind of feeling wolfing down Lalman's golgappas, or paani puris, sold from a handcart in a bylane near Lahurabir Chowk. What makes them irresistible isn't the tangy tamarind water but the filling, a slushy mix of chickpea, boiled potato and spices. He also serves a sweet version of the snack that feels almost like a dessert. Like most golgappa sellers in the city, the stuff he serves is customized to the amount of spicy heat your tastebuds can handle. Varanasi is a city of paan eaters. A long-lasting love affair with the paan makes a tongue hypersensitive to spice. This is primarily due to the use of chuna (lime), an essential ingredient for paan; hence the adjustment.Like Lalman, there are several other artistes of the palate strewn across the city, which is now Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's Lok Sabha constituency. One of the go-to places for breakfast is the late Chhanni Devi's, who sold puri-sabji and jalebis from a rundown shop in Lanka area, near BHU. Popularly known as ""Chachi"", she showered abuse on customers asking her to hurry up; the customers, in turn, were addicted to her rantings.Among the famous who graced the place was superstar Rajesh Khanna. The sabji served with the puri is made of pumpkin, potatoes and black gram. There is a rhythm with which her son Kailash Yadav flattens and shapes the dough before it is deep-fried, twice. The shop opens at 3.30 am. ""We start serving jalebis by 5 am and puri-sabji by 6. By 11.30 am, we are through,"" he says. A plate of four puris and sabji costs Rs 24.Adjacent are three shops selling lassi, all run by sons of Panna Sardar who ran the legendary original Pehalwan lassi. This is the third generation in the business. Lassis, with a dash of malai and saffron on top, are sold in clay cups. Some are so thick you almost need to chew.A kulhar (clay cup) of lassi is about beauty in minimalism. No frills; just the best of natural ingredients: curd made of buffalo milk, sugar and a hint of rosewater or saffron. It's part of the city's living heritage, created and consumed every day, sustained by a commitment to tradition. Places like these created a popular expression called 'Lanketing', going specifically to Lanka for snacks.Then there's Pappu's, the legendary tea stall in Assi mohalla that serves milk and lemon tea. The political gyan is free. The lemon tea here is flavoured with Hajmola, giving it a distinct whiff of heeng (asafoetida).There's much more. Near Lahurabir Chowk stands Jwala Prasad 's push cart selling rasedar pakora made of gram flour (besan), spinach and spices. The three are kneaded into a ball, deep fried and dipped in a fiery curry. Then it's served with a sprinkling of sohal, a salty savoury. The pakoras have two variations: sada and rangeen. The rangeen version is stuffed with bhang, a popular intoxicant generally laced with sweets.At Chetganj, Umashankar Sahu's family has been selling kachoris for three generations. As a peddler, Sahu has the smallest of stands where he keeps the kachoris, a little larger than a Rs 10 coin, garnished with shredded radish and carrot, and served with tamarind chutney.Varanasi is also famous for its sweets to which the city's Bengalis have also made a singular contribution. Shops with signs of desi and Bengali mithai can be seen. Some shops located around Pucca Mohal area along the ghats, sell their stuff only between 7 pm to 2 am. On offer are sweets suggestively named: Palangtod (Bed-breaker) and Malaipuri.One has deliberately avoided referring to the iconic Kashi and Deena Chat Bhandars at Godowlia Chowk which are more established joints. Crowds, including tourists, throng to Deena for a taste of their tamatar chaat, a rather unique snack which uses tomatoes ingeniously and which is eaten out of kullars. In the winter, chura matar, dripping with desi ghee, is the rage.Sometimes one wonders why food doesn't figure in the narrative of the holy city. Is it because it is primarily a business of yadavs and baniyas, who don't figure high in the city's intellectual story? There is no simple answer.What one does know is that there is a self-confidence to Varanasi; the way it looks at life, culture, and itself. The eternal city seems to stand a little above everything it surveys. There is a rhythm to its existence that's yet unspoiled by the ravages of time. And food is an inseparable part of it."

And, in northern Kerala, kidney stone is becoming a major health concern among workers in the Gulf.V.G. Pradeep Kumar, president, Kerala chapter, Indian Medical Association, said that over 80% of kidney diseases in the State were induced by hypertension and high blood sugar.Lifestyle changes are the main villain. The IMA has been running campaigns to create awareness on the issue. Many government hospitals now have lifestyle clinics which are addressing it, Dr. Kumar said.According to a study, around 30% of adults in Kerala are diabetic and 16% have high blood pressure. M. Thomas Mathew, former professor at Kozhikode Medical College, who is now senior consultant nephrologist at Baby Memorial Hospital here, said that those with high cholesterol levels too were at a higher risk of developing kidney diseases. The number of diabetic patients is more in Alappuzha and Pathanamthitta districts, he said.Kidney stone is another common problem found among the labourers who return from Gulf countries. It is caused by the extreme weather conditions in those countries and the contaminated water they consume. They use a lot of tomato in their food, like tomato juice and sauces. This leads to calcium deposits and later kidney stones, Dr. Mathew said.Focus on lifestyleHe said that increased focus on lifestyle changes would help prevent these problems.Regular health check-ups and screening blood and urine tests are a must. Smoking and alcohol consumption should be avoided. Control of diet, blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol and regular physical exercise will help, he said.Theme for the yearTo highlight these risks and to mark World Kidney Day, hospitals such as Baby Memorial Hospital and organisations such as the IMA are holding screening and awareness camps in the city on Thursday.

RoboThespian, a lanky, luminescent, human-like robot, who will be on display at the London Science Museums blockbuster exhibition charting the history robots, is a charismatic speaker, with the animated intonation of a confident orator, and digital eyes that focus and look around in an eerily-human way.Precisely when robots came to be created does of course depend on ones definition of a robot, and as curator Ben Russell points out there are 30 or 40 different characterisations. The exhibition links robots to our quest to recreate ourselves in mechanized form and therefore takes the starting point as around 500 years ago, when in the 16th century, the quest to understand the workings of the human body spurred the creation of mechanical devices. On display is one of the earliest such automated pieces: an automaton monk from 1560, created for Philip II of Spain, which could pray and walk across the table, moving its lips and raising its crucifix. Theres a spectacular silver swan from the 18th century that attracted huge crowds at the time with its ability to elegantly sway and pick up ornamental fish and lots of other fascinating mechanical pieces from across the world.However it wasnt till the 20th century that the word robot was coined: derived from the Czech word robota which means forced labour, and which was used by author Karel apek in his 1920 play about artificial humans, Rossums Universal Robots . It was also at this stage that robots began to take the shape that we traditionally associate with them the metallic, somewhat humanoid figures that have dominated literature and film. Theres a replica of one of the earliest  the Maria robot used in Fritz Langs film Metropolish in 1927, and Eric , one of the earliest ones made in the U.K.Artificial intelligenceIt was in the 1950s that the quest to imbue robots with intelligence and the ability to operate without remote control or a microphone began. On display is a cybernetic tortoise from 1951 that had the ability to find its own way. The exhibition also highlights the huge range of ways robots are capable of aiding human life: from those used in factories to the home, and even one capable of acting as a mediator for children with autism, helping them learn about human interaction.However, many challenges remain, as the exhibition carefully sets out. It highlights some of the current research under way, in particular efforts to create robots that are able to learn from humans and its surroundings. Theres Lucy, a British robot with 50,000 artificial neurons that over a period of years has learned to distinguish bananas and apples, and iCub, one of an Italian series of 30 robots that mimic toddlers, as they learn to discover the world around them, through their senses, learning as they go.However, surprisingly to many, the biggest challenge, lies not in artificial intelligence, but in something more fundamental, says Will Jackson, the director of Engineered Arts, the British company behind RoboThespian. Software is way ahead but the biggest challenge is mechanical, he says, noting that we are yet to have a robot capable of sustained and close human interaction and replicating the preciseness of human beings, or the strength of our muscles.The exhibition is open at the Science Museum in central London from February 8 to September 3, 2017."

KarunakaranM_KarunakaranArchana*, an anganwadi worker in Aminjikarai, is busy feeding a two-year-old at her centre, when a child's mother comes in and drops a carrot in a small basket tied to the window. She quickly gets up, takes the vegetable and thanks the parent.If you can, please bring two tomatoes tomorrow. We are running short, she says. Sure, the parent responds. Do you need anything else? she asks. No ma. Sujata said she would get greens the day after, Ms. Archana replies and resumes feeding the child.Every morning, as the children are dropped off at her centre, at least one parent drops a vegetable of their choice in the basket. Ms. Subbulakshmi then uses it to prepare the meal of the day.I do not have enough money to buy vegetables every month. On request, one parent drops in a vegetable of their choice everyday and I use it to cook the meal. Sometimes, the basket remains empty and I have to spend from my pocket, she pointed out.Archana has been an anganwadi teacher for the last 25 years.I have my own family to take care of, and the money I finally take home is not enough to make ends meet. I need help, she said.Delay in refundBuying vegetables is a major source of difficulty for anganwadi workers in the city. They spend from their pocket when there is a shortage, but it takes a long time to get reimbursed.We have to be refunded within four months, but sometimes it takes six months or more, said an anganwadi teacher in Poonamallee on condition of anonymity. I look after 20 children at this centre. While I do my best to look after their needs, what I take home is minimal. I have three young children of my own to look after.In 2014, the Department of Social Welfare and Nutritious Meal Programme extended their variety meal scheme to all anganwadi centres across the State. It was based on the nutritional requirements of children in the age group of 2 to 5 years. The variety meal included mixed rice, vegetable rice, lemon rice, dhal rice, boiled potatoes and eggs, among other items.The Department later increased the feeding charges in anganwadis from 56 paise to Rs. 1.13 per child for days when dal is prepared, which includes 70 paise for vegetables, 24 paise for fuel/cylinder and the rest for condiments. When there is no dal on the menu, the allocation is Rs. 1.35, including 80 paise for vegetables, 36 paise for fuel/cylinder and the rest for condiments. However, 5 paise is deducted from spices, as salt is provided by the Civil Supplies Corporation.Add shortage of essential commodities like salt and palm oil to that of vegetables. Uma*, an anganwadi worker in Royapuram, has reportedly not received salt for the last four months. There are 25 children at her centre. Here, too, the workers seek handouts from parents.Every month, anganwadi workers make a list of essentials and hand it over to the respective Child Development Project Officers (CDPO). The lists are submitted to the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation which, in turn, sends the supplies to the anganwadis. In case of delay, workers use the buffer stock at their centres.Officials say no shortageOfficials from the Social Welfare Department brush off reports of delays. We recently checked and no such problem was reported. In case a few centres are facing problems, we shall look into them,"" said a senior official.K. Shanmugavelayutham, convener, TN-FORCES, said the State should provide a contingency grant to every anganwadi centre so that they can recoup and take steps accordingly.

The yield is high now, and so is supply. At present, a gunny bag of cabbage consisting 50 kilos is priced at Rs. 150 to Rs. 200 in the wholesale market. During the corresponding period last year, a gunny bag of cabbage was priced at Rs. 1,000. In the retail market, cabbage is sold for Rs. 5 to Rs. 10, he added. Cabbage is supplied from Hosur and parts of Andhra Pradesh.However, Mr. Balu said that the rates of vegetables might start to increase as the mercury level rises. When the sun soars, the production will be affected and there will be water scarcity. Usually, the rates of vegetables will climb up at this time. It is likely that the costs might go up in March, he added."

It is for the first time in the last many years that we are not cultivating our full 8 acres of land, but only a part of it, he said.The only vegetables to be trading at affordable prices are onions and potatoes which are below Rs. 20 a kg. The climate is now apt for onions and the market is being flooded with a good supply, said a leading onion merchant at the APMC Yard in Yeshwanthpur. Though tomatoes are being sold at Rs. 25-Rs. 27 a kg, they are of a poor quality, said a wholesaler trader."

But how long I am going to meet their needs, I dont knowAnnakiliVendorIn the last 10 to 15 days, there is a huge drop in the arrival of vegetables in uzhavar sandhais, much to the surprise of not only retail buyers, but even the traders and farmers themselves.Beans sold at Rs. 20 a kg till a fortnight back is being sold at Rs. 55 to Rs. 60. Shallot which was sold at Rs. 15 to 18 a kg, is now Rs. 50. Tomatoes, available for as low as Rs. 6 in January is sold for Rs. 25 to Rs. 30. Prices of drumstick and brinjal have also gone up. There appears to be a 30 to 50 per cent rise in prices of select vegetables in the citys two biggest uzhavar sandhais at Anna Nagar and B.B. Kulam.After these markets were started over a decade ago, there has been a direct connect between the farmers and the end-consumers. Despite change in governments, officials have given value-additions to these markets in the form of cold storage facility to stock the produce, electronic scales etc.The district administration is also striving to keep these markets free of plastic bags. Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao conducts periodic checks on the general functioning of the farmers markets and whether the rules laid out for the farmers were followed. All these measures have resulted in the success of the uzhavar sandhai concept.The prices of vegetables are fixed on a daily basis in sync with the arrivals at the Central Vegetable Market near Mattuthavani. There is also a huge wholesale vegetable market at Paravai, run by a private consortium.According to officials, about 200 tonnes of vegetables are sold by the two uzhavar sandhais by 400 registered farmers. Though there is a less popular  uzhavar sandhai on Anaiyur Main Road.The registered farmers, who raise vegetables on their own fields, bring them to the markets by public transport. On arrival, the officials fix the prices on a weighted average method by taking the prices quoted in central market and private chain stores, thus making it attractive for cost-conscious buyers.Reason for the dipA senior official attributed the sudden dip in arrival of vegetables to the prevailing drought conditions in the State. Every day, the temperature is rising sharply and water sources are fast depleting. Even places which are considered fertile pockets do not have enough water. As a result, a farmer who used to harvest 10 sacks of Brinjal is able to get just two sacks now. Rain alone can save the farmers, he saidIronically, though there was 84 mm rainfall in March in Madurai city and its peripheries till Sunday, against the normal average of 24 mm, the rain was abnormal and did not serve the purpose.When the farmers wanted rains, there were none. The abnormal temperature has only worsened the situation now, Valarmathi, who sells carrot and brinjal in BB Kulam  uzhavar sandhai said.After failure of monsoon, she has started getting English vegetables from Kodaikanal where her husband is growing them in a small piece of land belonging to their relative.I dont want to say no to my regular customers when they ask for specific items. But how long I am going to meet their needs, I dont know, Annakili, another vendor, said.At Anna Nagar  uzhavar sandhai, the first to be opened in Tamil Nadu by the then Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, the mood of farmers is the same.It is expected that the prices of vegetables will be volatile till the end of summer.When the farmers wanted rains, there were none.

KarthikeyanG_KARTHIKEYAN;G_KARTHIKEYAN - G_KARTHIKEYANAcute drought and sharp depletion of groundwater table weighed down horticulturists at several villages in Dindigul union. The worst-affected were drumstick growers.Chettiyapatti, Kalikampatti, Munnilaikottai, Nadupatti and adjacent areas were major drumstick production centres in the union. Drumstick has also been cultivated as intercrop in tomato and onion fields.Several farmers preferred hybrid plant variety of drumstick to traditional variety for better yield and little maintenance.Already, several bore wells and open wells at these villages dried up owing to the acute drought, creating a shortage of water for irrigation. Residents have been running from pillar to post for water for drinking and other purposes.With no sources to maintain regular supply, horticulturists have started purchasing water from Dindigul and nearby areas to protect the standing crops.S. Palani, farmer in Kalikkampatti, said though drumstick crop was drought- tolerant, a minimum quantity of water was required to keep the plant alive.The plants should be irrigated at least once in two or three days. We had to shell out a sizable amount of money for water. Suppliers deliver water in lorries and tractors, he added.Intermittent showers in the past two days brought some relief. But it was only temporary and it would not help the horticulturists in the long run, he added.The farmers in area said already debt burden had been haunting many who had small land holdings.Several fund- starved farmers were in distress as they could not afford to buy water to protect the standing crops. Now their fate was in the hands of rain god, they said."

Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam, the price of most vegetables has gone up by Rs. 1 to Rs. 2 per kg.As Mr. Balu puts it, In the summer, many vegetables perish easily and so the cost of perishable vegetables has doubled. This includes beans, broad beans ( avarakkai ) and cauliflower.A kg of beans now cost Rs. 40 to Rs. 60, while broad beans cost Rs. 30 and cauliflower costs Rs. 20, he points out.Tomatoes too are turning out to be expensive. From Rs. 8 a kg last month, the price has gone up to Rs. 15, and is now Rs. 20, he said.When summer is here, vegetable production will be hit and subsequently supply will be affected. With acute water shortage across the State, farmers will most likely find it hard to cultivate crops and yield a good harvest. Also, there has been an increase in pest attacks on the produce over the last few summers.Combination of factorsAll these factors, coupled with the increase in fuel prices and transportation cost have led to a rise in prices, he said.Earlier, a bag of 60-70 kg of cabbage cost Rs. 300 to Rs. 350 in the wholesale market. Now, it costs Rs. 500, he said. Onions offer some solace for customers as the price ranges between Rs. 8 and Rs. 16 in the retail market.Small onions are sold for Rs. 25 to Rs. 40, while the local variety of brinjal (thorny) is priced at Rs. 30 a kg. Drumstick is sold at Rs. 20 kg, while potatoes cost Rs. 16 to Rs. 18.Good quality peas are sold at Rs. 40, while yam costs Rs. 25. The cost of other vegetables such as snake gourd, bitter gourd and green chillies ranges between Rs. 15 and Rs. 20 and ginger is sold at Rs. 40.

He also said that such large-scale crop-loss was having an adverse effect on the agricultural biosafety which was paramount to food security.Nematodes, consisting of roundworms, threadworms and eelworms, are causing loss of crops to the tune of almost 60 million tonnes or 10-12 % of crop production every year, said Mr. Chakrabarty.

Lanes devoted to vegetarian food open up at dawn. Thats when you get breakfast fare of crisp kachoris and runny potato curries, or juicy jalebis and thickened, creamy milk.

Next to is a large slab of butter. The ustad at the counter grills the chicken on a skewer over a coal fire. Once done, the pieces are put in a bowl. A masala is sprinkled over it  a mix of chillies, dried mango powder and chaat masala  and a spoonful of chutney. In a pan, a slab of butter is heated and once it melts into a golden liquid, it is poured over the chicken. The pot is given a good shake, and Anmols butter chicken  hot, spicy, buttery and juicy  is ready.

Skin being the most absorbent organ of the body, requires special care. With the environment already unleashing high level of toxins on our health, its time to be alert about not just our lifestyle, what we eat, drink and even breathe, but also what we apply on your body. This is where Ayurveda come to your rescue. Unlike beauty regimens, Ayurveda is ideal for all skin types.In conversation with Hyderabad Express, Dr GG Gangadharan, Director Ramaiah Indic Specialty Ayurveda, Ayurvedic advisor, Lever Ayush, reveals why it is time to throw those bottles and tubes of creams and packs, and head to the kitchen and fridge instead.We often witness college-goers wrap their faces in dupattas to keep away the pollution but it still gets to them. Suggest some skin care routine.Wash face with lukewarm water mixed with 1tsp honey and 1 tsp lemon juice twice a day (in the morning and as soon as you reach home). Massage face and neck with oil which helps in enhancing complexion like Chemparathyadi Coconut oil (based with hibiscus) and Nalpamaradi Coconut oil (Based on Nalpamara viz., Ficus family and Turmeric). These medicines are available in all Ayurvedic pharmacies. If you are used to drinking milk, boil garlic (3 gms, peeled, washed and crushed) in 1 cup of milk, filter and take it internally at bed time.

""We've been collecting these duties -- we just haven't been doing it very well. The WTO is silent on the issue of incompetence."""

However, the situation might change, if the strike continues, warn experts.As many as three lakh lorries in the State went off the roads from Thursday pressing for their demands which include withdrawal of the Centres order increasing the third-party insurance and high toll tax collection on State highways. Though the lorry owners association has exempted essential services like milk, medicines, water and petrol from the purview of the stir, some sections of petrol tank operators have joined the stir across the State on Saturday.""Of the total 1,500 petrol tankers, only 500 were operated on the third day of the stir. Already the petroleum sales have dipped by 60 per cent from Monday, the petrol tankers association has also decided to join the stir in a full-fledged manner. If this happens, the petroleum users across the State might face a serious problem, said Andhra Pradesh Federation of Petroleum Dealers (APFPD) president R Gopala Krishna.Speaking to Express, Rythu Bazar estate officer M Ramesh Babu said that indefinite lorry strike has no impact on the vegetable prices. Most of the vegetables are procured from the nearby villages across the city through auto rickshaws and APSRTC buses. Moreover, the vegetable prices are slashed by Rs 5 on each variety as this is the harvesting season for all the horticulture crops, he said.Veggies turn dearer as arrivals declineThe prices of vegetables also remained stable in Visakhapatnam, Guntur and Rajamahendravaram, but the situation was different in Kurnool. The strike has created artificial scarcity of essential commodities, especially vegetables and their prices are going skyward.As Kurnool city depends on vegetable imports from places like Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and other places, the supply constraints due to lorry strike burnt holes in the pockets of consumers.Kurnool imports potato and ginger from Delhi, Agra, Gujarat and nearly 100 tonnes arrives every day to the local markets. Because of strike, potato prices have doubled from Rs 15 to Rs 30 per kg, while ginger too saw similar price hike from Rs 25 to Rs 50 per kg. Tomatoes which were regular imports from Kadapa, Chittoor and Mahabubnagar districts also had its prices doubled from Rs 15 per kg."

The meat is chewy and the creamy coleslaw retains a bite. This heavy is topped with a sunny-side-up egg, which has soft edges. On the side, you get lightly toasted, crisp slices of bread, (too sweet) baked beans, herbed and grilled potatoes, (indifferently) grilled tomato and a cup of tea or coffee or juice. If you can have this and still manage a dessert, you should audition for Man v/s Food.The Ham Basket, despite its few weak links, makes for a great breakfast.If you like something lighter, stick to the pancakes. They are fluffy and mildly sweetened and the chef makes them with soyamilk on request (if you are intolerant to dairy). I suggest the pancakes with maple syrup (a common favourite) and pancakes with caramelised bananas. If you have a sweet tooth, you can order these with whipped cream and any of the fruity crushes.I havent tried their coffee but their teas are worth going back for. I have gone back to have their ginger tea, it is watery and generous with the ginger. Their pot of masala tea, with the same consistency and the strong flavour, is also a good order. These cups are for mornings before a brisk walk in the sun or, for evenings, to wake you up for polite conversations.The Srilankan Curry with Steamed Rice and Salad is thick with coconut milk. Therefore, it is mostly bland but the salad goes perfectly with it. The salad has purple and green cabbage, mixed with shredded coconut and crushed peanuts. You may bite an occasional slice of chilli in it.The salad comes with the Malaysian Chicken Massaman Curry with Steamed Rice too. This one, blander than the Srilankan dish, has lightly cooked potatoes and soft pieces of chicken in it.Spicy Prawn Curry with Mint Rice and Peanut Salad is more tomato based and tastes like sambar as a friend said. This does not take away from its goodness and the mint in the rice is more a nudge, than a push.In the desserts, we try the waffle with vanilla ice cream. This smells of a warm kitchen with fresh loaves of bread and the ice cream is whisked to the right smoothness. That said, if you do not like eggs or the smell of eggs, dont have this.Price for two: Rs 1,000 (mains and tea)"

The only government-run cold storage in Rayagada was inaugurated by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik in 2013 but it has been lying unused since then.The equipment are now damaged and the building has developed cracks. It was constructed at a cost of three crore rupees over one acre of land in Rayagada town with a storage capacity of 5,000 MT.The godown was constructed by the Marketing Federation of Government of Odisha (MARKFED).After completion of the cold storage facility, MARKFED handed over the facility to Tribal Development Co-operative Corporation (TDCC) under the Tribal Welfare department for maintenance.Though traders and farmers were invited to use it, the rent being demanded by the TDCC was apparently too high. Subsequently, no trader or farmer evinced interest in using the facility.At present, Rs 13,000 is being paid towards the electricity bill of the godown. Apparently, the power tariff would have gone up to two lakh rupees if it was made operational.Power accounts for 70 per cent of the operating expenses of cold storages. As the cold storage operator would have passed on the cost to farmers and traders, they refrained from using it, said Pratap Sahoo, a trader.Even as the local administration assured the traders and farmers of meeting the electricity expenses, the latter did not turn up. As it remained unused for years, the equipment, wooden racks and ceiling of the cold storage developed cracks and the roof leaked every time it rained.Last year, the State Government sanctioned Rs 63 lakh for TDCC to repair the cold storage. However, as there are no technical staff in the TDCC, the funds were diverted to Horticulture department.But work is yet to begin. Branch Manager of TDCC, Ashok Patra, who is also a member of the godown supervision committee, said the tender for the godown repair has been already floated and work would begin soon. It will have facilities to store tamarind, tomatoes, mangoes, pineapples and other vegetables, he added."

I worked in prominent hotel groups in Coonoor and Coorg where I honed my skills.Sunish P SurendranI have also had the opportunity to work on some government project (on a contract), while also occasionally lending a hand to aspiring chefs at culinary institutes. My style of cuisine is mostly Mediterranean  the one thing that I love about it is that it is so varied in style!The Mediterranean belt consists of nearly 21 countries from Turkey, Cyprus, Italy, France, Morocco and several North African countries, each with similar preparation style with tweaks in names and ingredients. So it gives you regional variations of the same dish, which is fascinating to cook. One of my favourite Mediterranean dishes is Tajine which is from North Africa. It has steamed meat, vegetables, and spices cooked in clay earthen pots. It is a very popular main course dish that can be adapted to Indian style of cooking as well. Mostly, it is served along with couscous.Another favourite of mine is the Ratatouille. I also served as the Chef Garde Manager (keeper of the food) at several hotels where I was in charge of the cold cuts and salad sections. Im equally adept at whipping up favourites like Caesars and Greek salads in veg and non-veg combinations. I prefer to use homemade products rather than sourced products. I prefer fresh herbs for cooking that I handpick from the market.The thing about Mediterranean is that it can easily be adapted as fusion food; in fact, Tajine is most commonly made with tomato puree that gives it a sour taste which Indians may not find palatable. So I make it with our own Indian garam masala and spices and grind them to give it a unique taste and aroma! Your cooking will not be worth the hard work if you do not have a presentation style that suits the dish, only then will the customer also feel satisfied. You have to cook a dish like you are cooking it for yourself for it to actually come out well."

The fate of the flora and fauna in the region has become a cause for concern with the Met department calling the impending summer a cruel one  Albin MathewKOCHI: Stay coolBesides the unbearable heat, summer season is also well known for the health problems that it brings in its wake. Express gives a few dietary tips that will help Kochiites beat the heatDrink lots of waterThis one is obvious, but it cant be repeated enough. In summer your body is prone to dryness as water is literally evaporating off you. So even more than usual, keep your body hydrated by drinking plenty of water.If plain water seems too boring, add a couple of slices of cucumber, a few berries, a squirt of lemon, or a few sprigs of lemon balm to keep you coming back for more.Coconut water: Coconut is full of health benefits and has wonderful cooling properties. It is laden with simple sugars, electrolytes and essential minerals which help keep the body well hydrated.Lime water: The simple lime water or nimboo pani is not only refreshing, it also has health benefits for you.Butter milk: A glass everyday to avoid dehydration and indigestion.Curd and Yoghurt: They are a great and healthy alternative to ice-cream as they are packed with nutrients, vitamins and calcium which help to soothe ulcers, allergies and heat boils during the season. Juices: Fresh fruit juices, including lemonade, help replenish the body of its lost fluids.VegetablesRaw vegetables are always cooling, but due to their high water content, the 5 veggies like cucumbers, radishes, lettuce, celery, spinach are especially good. Vegetables like onions, tomatoes and cucumbers should be regularly eaten as they will not only cool down the body but provide the daily quota of nutrition as well.Onions: Onions have amazing cooling properties. Red onions, in particular, are very rich in quercetin, which is a natural anti-allergen. Having lots of onions can provide you protection against sunstroke.Cucumber: This crunchy vegetable costs little, has lots of fibre that can help keep constipation at bay.Mint Mint is a simple, easily available, inexpensive herb which you can add to your curd to make pudina raita or have it in the form of chutneys besides using it in dips. The best thing about it is that you can grow it in a small pot at home for your use.Cardamom: A cup of cardamom tea can do wonders for those who have been in the hot sun for long because of its detoxifying properties.FruitsJust like raw vegetables, fruits are almost always cooling to the system. You can eat them directly as a snack or dessert, make a smoothie, or add them to your water for a tasty refreshing experience. Gooseberry (Amla): A great refresher and reverses the ageing effects caused by strong sun rays while providing extra stamina for gym sessions. It specially benefits heart and hair.Watermelon: If youre thirsty, watermelon works wonders in replenishing lost fluids for the body, Watermelon will keep you cool, hydrated, satiated and healthy. Melons contain lycopene that protects your skin against sun damage.Berries: Not only are these little gems delicious and sweet, but they are also packed with flavonoids that provide antioxidant benefits. They can also promote increased blood flow to your skin and decrease your sensitivity to light to improve your skins appearance, structure and texture,Pineapple: Pineapples provide a good mix of vitamins, antioxidants and enzymes like bromelain that can protect your body against inflammation.Mango: Mangos are packed with vitamin A and C.Papaya: Some people use papaya juice to tenderize meat or as a natural exfoliating ingredient for healthy and glowing skin. But there are also nutritional benefits to eating papaya on its own.Fish, especially ShellfishAgain tapping into the oceans coolness, Chinese medicine recognizes most fish as cool, and shellfish as cold in nature. This means that even after theyre cooked, the result of eating fish, especially shellfish, will be to counteract any heat thats lingering in your system.Foods not to eatYou must avoid burgers with meat patties, fries and other oily fare. Burgers and summer may sound like a match made in heaven, but the fact is they can give your body temperature a spike. Foods that contain high amounts of protein and fat heat up your body. They move slowly through the digestive system, causing your body to use more energy. However, the spike in temperature isnt enough to cause you to sweat and cool down, which happens when you eat spicy foods on hot days.(Inputs from Susan Itty,Clinical Nutritionist, Aster MediCity)"

With incidents of hate crime rising in the Land of Opportunity, many students are now having second thoughts on choosing US as a preferred destination for higher studies.Why spend tens of thousands of dollars on education in another country when you can avail the same at Germanys top institutes at practically zero cost, with the added benefit of securing attractive scholarships, says Amita Desai, Founding Director of Goethe-Zentrum Hyderabad (GZH).Barring a few specialised courses, education in Germany is free. After studies, you have a two-year window to search for jobs, and the duration of the work visa depends on the employer, adds Amita.For students interested in learning German, we are open seven days a week.Comprising different batches, courses begin at 6:30 am and continue till 8 pm. We also train teachers at 25 schools, including Kendriya Vidyalayas, etc., and work with them to upgrade their skills, said Padmavathi, Head of Language department at GZH.Not just education, Germany is taking big strides in the field of environment sustainability, says Amita. Chancellor Angela Merkel set a 10-year goal in 2011 for the country to be free of nuclear energy. Currently, nearly two-thirds of Germany runs on clean energy, and that is a big accomplishment, she adds.Seeking to replicate Germanys success story in environment, GZH, in association with Chirec International School and Green Gables International School in the city, has recently started a programme KiddoGardener. This is a three-month initiative to create urban farmers in kids and teach them environmentally sustainable ways of growing vegetables, said Narsing Arravally, Founder of KiddoGardener.Practicing what they preach, the terrace of Goethes guesthouse, adjacent to GZH office, is cultivating Brinjal, Capsicum, Tomatoes, Lettuce, Coriander, and many other vegetables, without the use of pesticides.Workshops are also being taught to schoolchildren on various topics such as plastic management, pest management, recycling used items, compost management, garbage segregation, etc., adds Narsing.Amita Desai is also the Honorary Representative of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg. She oversees two-way promotion of art and culture initiatives between Hyderabad and Hamburg.Recently, two designers came from Hamburg, and over 20 students worked with them on architecture designs. We also have yearly school-exchange programmes between Hamburg and Hyderabad, she adds.On future goals, Amita adds that for the convenience of learners, plans are on to create additional language centres, one each in Secunderabad and Kukatpally.Signing off, Amita Desai says, We shouldnt be building walls, but breaking them.

He shares his produce with his friends and colleagues after keeping a bit away for his family.Sanjeev believes in organic gardening, free of insecticides and pesticides. I dont use any kind of chemical, he says. I prefer pure, homemade pesticides such as sour curd for spraying on the plants. It will deter the insects. If sour curd is kept outside for a couple of days, the sourness in it will get rid of insects. Neem oil is my last resort. It is the strongest in the organic spray.He started gardening in his balcony experimenting with spinach leaves. They did well and I began growing tomatoes in paint buckets... It has been three and half years since and I grow almost everything on the terrace, including strawberries, says the gardener who hasnt visited his neighbourhood market for the past one year.Sanjeev stresses on watering plants right. I have put a timer on the drip irrigation system and it takes care of watering. I customised the whole system without taking any help from a third party, he says. Watering is the most important thing in gardening. We should neither water more nor less. For Bengalurus climate, I water only once every two days.Sanjeev visits his rooftop garden twice a day and spends his weekends tending to it, removing weeds and planting new plants."

The Central Prison at Poojappura has opened a vegetable store on its premises where you can buy fresh vegetables grown in an organic way.The sales counter, launched as part of governments Haritha Keralam Mission, is near the main gate of the central prison. It was opened by Haritha Keralam Mission vice-chairman T N Seema on Thursday. In the first phase the counter will be open for three days per week - Monday, Wednesday and Friday.The inaugural day witnessed a huge crowd which according to the jail authorities has boosted their confidence. Around 25 types of vegetables were sold out at the counter by noon, said Deputy Prison Officer Ajayakumar, who coordinates farming activities in the Central Jail.A cultural programme organised as part of the expoVegetables which were in high demand included ladies finger, pumpkin, bitter gourd, tomato, ivy gourd, raw banana and long beans. We did not bring the produce in huge quantities since it was the inaugural day. But literally everything was sold out by noon, Ajayakumar said.Another attraction of the stall is the discounted rate offered. Vegetables are priced even lower than the Horticorp rates.The idea of opening a regular stall was mooted by T N Seema during a public function in the central jail last month. Produces of the Open Jail, Nettukaltheri will also be sold through the stall.Farming is done in over ten hectares of the central jail. 30 prisoners have been tasked with the upkeep of the farm. About 70 percent of the seed requirement is met from the farm itself and rest is bought from the College of Agriculture, Vellayani.The Nettukaltheri Open Prisons undertakes vegetable farming on 20 acres. Plantain, spinach, ladies finger and salad cucumber are the major crops. All our products are safe-to-eat organic vegetables, said Jail Superintendent Sam Thankayyan.Vegetables left after meeting the food requirements of jail are sold to local residents at subsidized rates.

There are palms that can be tucked into a corner of your living room, ferns that can spill out of ceramic containers for your dining table or trees with glossy leaves that can shade your reading nook from a glaring sun. We speak to gardeners and ask them to share their secrets on indoor gardening. A good reference point to start would be the NASAs list of indoor and air-filtering plants.Namratha, Smart GardensAccording to this greenskeeper, it is vital to maintain proper cross ventilation in the planting area. Interior trees need more sunlight than the others, and Dracaena can be the best tree to grow indoors. Areca Palms, temple tree, lucky bamboos and ficus can be grown as well. ""Indoor plants require more care and attention than the outdoor ones, says Namratha. It is vital to give the plants organic and nutritious soil with a mix of vermicompost and coco peat to retain water. To start with, plant lettuce, gourd, tomato, radish and brinjal. ""Indoor plants need to be trained to accept very less sunlight and perform photosynthesis with that minimal amount of light, she says. They eventually start growing well with good care and mineral supplements. She also suggests air-purifying plants such as mints, aloe-vera, spider plants and snake plants.Vandhana, Urban MaliAccording to Vandhana, there are no fully shade-loving trees. On NASAs research on air-purifying plants, she says that our air-conditioners, refrigerators and other appliances emit many invisible toxins and the Red-edged Dracaena, Golden Pothos and Chrysanthemum can clear the air. ""For indoor trees, find a spot with maximum sunlight and spaces such as good courtyards, she says. A small tree can grow in a 3-feet container but it will eventually grow weak and die. She recommends, instead, plants that usually grow under the canopy in the forests. Research about foliage plants and not flowering plants, because flowering ones need more sunlight, she says. Vandhana cautions not over water the plants. Water them the plants on alternate days, she says, because over watering may cause fungal diseases in the roots of the plants and trees indoors.Govind, Urban Orchid BoutiqueLightweight Expanded Clay Aggregate or LECA is the way to go, according to Govind. This is semi- hydroponic structure supports easy plant and tree growth without the soil, therefore no messy spots. Sansevieria trifasciata, more popularly known as mother-in-law plants, are easy to grow indoors in colder climates. It is said to remove 4-5 toxins in the air and produce more oxygen at nights, making the plant ideal for bedrooms and living rooms, says Govind. He also recommends various types of Orchids. ""Phalaenopsis or moth orchids are very common in the U.S. And so are the Paphiopedilums. Throw in a mix of various colors and you will have a fully bloomed garden for a minimum of 60 days"", he says.Dipali, Grace PottersDipali says that we dont use cocopeat enough, though India is one of its largest exporters. Any soil has an expiry date, she says, we need to keep on replenishing it with manure. The soil will eventually lose its strength but coco peat absorbs about 10 times more water than soil and can easily sustain big indoor trees like palms and orchids with it. Also people look at big things like equipment and interior landscaping but dont check the smaller details like holes in the pots, which could drain the water and leave the soil dry. Indoor trees need at least 1-2 hours of direct or 4-5 hours of diffused sunlight daily. The horticulturist suggests Anthuriums and palms such as Flame Thrower, Slender lady, Chinese fan and ruffled fan. ""Cactus with flowers are also a good indoor options, she says."

As we travel through the rickety roads of Shollinganallur, we reach our destination  HLC International School and directly land in the mini garden located right behind the campus. Soaking in the Sun, a bunch of young children mixing clay and mud, some observing the growth of the planted seeds, while some jumping in what looks like a natural make-shift trampoline made of dried leaves, within the garden are our first take away as we observe the scene. But no, this isnt an eco-friendly play park we are talking about.Students jump in the naturaltrampoline of compostLike two other schools in the city (Ramana Vidyalaya at Shollinganallur, Tattva School, Polachery) HLC International has tied up with Grow Your Own Veggies, a nonprofit organisation, the brainchild of Alladi Mahadevan, to promote sustainability and provide hands-on learning sessions and guidance on how to foster sustainable living to children and parents. As the school is gearing up for an exhibition on different branches of sustainable models of organic gardening and organic farming on January 20 and 21, City Express walks through the organic trail to learn more.As we trace the work of the students through the trail, Upasna, Dharini and Gayathri, three class IX students, take us around. Most of us waste money and resources in the second part of our lives on hospital bills, mainly because of soil contamination. Its important to have nutritious soil. It gives us water, food and shelter, says Gayathri, as she points to the patch of land, adapting a sun ray formation of farming. Through this method there is an optimal usage of land and water. And we are using a triad arrangement in this system, she explains.The compost pit on one patch forms the sun with rays of plants radiating out, while a live pond becomes the sun in another.Following five main themes of sustainable models here: organic farming, organic gardening, living soil, natural building and traditional cooking, the students have worked tediously, opine the teachers.Going by a strict no-chemicals mantra, the students have grown 25 varieties of paddy, 26 varieties of millets, nine kinds of greens, 60 herbs, oilseeds, beans, gourds, greens, root vegetables, tomatoes, chilies, fruits, and flowers. All these have been grown from native seeds and indigenous saplings fully organically, without the use of any kind of chemical additives, says Mahadevan.Here the students of the school not only learn to work with soil, irrigation, harvesting and sowing, but constantly apply the exercises in other subjects as well. Confused? We learn everything from math, sociology, and physics through what we do here. This is connected academically and we relate to most of these exercises while we learn the curriculum in other subjects, shares Dharini. The students learn about pressure, measurements, crop cycles and other aspects as they work their way in establishing a sustainable eco system within the campus.As the work to make the mixture of a clay wall is happening in full throttle on one side, a bunch of sixth graders jump on a four feet deep natural compost pit on the other, calling it an au natural trampoline! Inviting us inside the pit, which has layers of twigs, dry leaves, top soil and mainly a mixture of amritakaraisal  a mixture of rotten fruits, jaggery, cow dung and cow urine, a student shares, This is a community composting set up an is a rich reservoir of life and nutrition that spreads gradually into the surrounding areas through the action of earthworms and other organisms.From learning and discussing nitrogen fixation, organisms, microorganisms and optimisation, the children have good knowledge of sustainability, which they intend to share with schools, government and other organisation in upcoming exhibition, Sashwatham."

She cited that the vegetables in the village were way much cheaper than in Sambalpur city.In the village, potato was being sold at Rs 5 per kg, one and half kg of tomato for Rs 10, drum sticks for Rs 20 and cabbage for Rs 3 per kg. On the other hand, potato is selling for Rs 8 a kilo, tomato Rs 10 per kg and drum sticks Rs 35 per kg in the city.A view of the vegetable market in Sambalpuron Saturday | ExpressWhile traders attribute the difference in prices to transportation and porter cost besides levy imposed by Regulated Market Committees, failure of authorities concerned to rein in the vendors seems to have led the farmers to such a situation.The tall promises made by the BJD Government to provide 35 per cent irrigation in each block besides cold storage across the State remain unfulfilled. Blame it on the indifference of the administration which has left the vegetable growers and farmers at the mercy of vendors, who never fail to exploit them.The prices of vegetables were much lower a week ago and began rising with the rise in mercury level.Green chilli, which is available at Rs 24 per kg in the village, is sold at Rs 40 in town and city markets, tomato is priced at Rs 120 for 25 kg (Rs 4.80 a kg) and sold at Rs 10 per kg, brinjal around Rs 6 against market price of Rs 10 to Rs 12 per kg, cucumber is sold by farmers at Rs 15 per kg while it costs Rs 20 in the market. On the other hand, there is a margin of Rs 10 in one kg of coriander leaves which is purchased at Rs 30 and sold at Rs 40, beans are priced at Rs 20 and sold at Rs 30.But, the summer vegetables of pointed gourd (potal) and ladies finger are expensive as of now with pointed gourd being sold by farmers at Rs 70 a kg. The same is sold between Rs 90 and Rs 120, ladies finger is sold in open market at Rs 50 per kg while farmers are selling it at Rs 30 per kg.It is the cabbage growers who have been badly hit with many failing to recover even the harvesting cost. A bag containing 40 kg cabbage is available for Rs 100 even as it is being sold at Rs 6 per kg in the open market, while cauliflower is being purchased from growers at Rs 12 to Rs 14 and sold by vendors at Rs 20.Onion growers too are crying tears of neglect. In Titlagarh, the Nashik of Odisha, distress sale was reported. Although it has been two years since an integrated pack house was developed by APICOL, mere transfer of land to install the transformer to electrically charge the pack house has denied the onion growers to stock their produce and sell it when prices soar."

There are common myths associated with food allergies which needs to be addressed.Myth 1: Food allergy is very commonFact: Although 25 percent of people think theyre allergic to certain foods, studies show that about only eight percent of children and two percent of adults have food allergy.Myth 2: Most people with food allergies are allergic to oranges and tomatoesFact: Although people can be allergic to any kind of food, most food allergies are caused by nuts, cows milk, eggs, soy, fish, and shellfish.Myth 3: Some people are allergic to sugar and fatsFact: A condition is called a food allergy when the immune system fights against a certain protein in a food. This doesnt happen with sugar and fats.Myth 4: Milk allergy is very common in adultsFact: Milk allergy is much more common in children than in adults. Most children outgrow the allergy by the time they are six years old. Symptoms of milk allergy include hives, vomiting, and breathing problems after eating or drinking a dairy product. Some adults have trouble digesting the sugar in milk. This is called lactose intolerance. It isnt a true allergy. Symptoms of lactose intolerance are bloating, cramping, nausea, gas, and diarrhea.Myth 5: People with food allergies are allergic to many foodsFact: Most people with food allergies are allergic to fewer than four foods. Its important to test for food allergy and confirm this as its important not to stop all foods just based on some symptoms as growing children need all food.Myth 6: Allergy to food dye is commonFact: Natural foods cause the most allergic reactions. Studies have found that some food additives, such as yellow dye No.5 and aspartame (brand name: NutraSweet), cause problems in some people.Myth 7: Food allergy is either lifelong or is always outgrownFact: Children usually outgrow allergies to milk, eggs, soybean products, and wheat. But people usually do not outgrow allergies to nuts, fish, and shellfish.Myth 8: Food allergy is not dangerousFact: Food allergy can be fatal if it is severe enough to cause a reaction called anaphylaxis .This reaction makes it hard for a person to breathe. Fast treatment with a medicine called epinephrine can save your life. If you or your child have a severe allergy, your doctor might give you a prescription for epinephrine self-injection pens.Myth 9:Food allergy is a clinical diagnosisFact : Diagnosis of food allergy depends on a good history, demonstration of sensitation objectively via skin prick testing or serum specific IgE and confirmation of food allergy via double blind placebo controlled food challenge. Consult pediatric allergist for proper evaluation."

Interestingly, this IT hub has a rocky terrain.Her backyard also has banana trees and ornamental plants, which keep the surroundings fresh and cool. Pests pose the biggest challenge for her.I use neem oil or neem cakes and paste of chili powder, turmeric and garlic to keep them out, she says. It is important to understand how much sun your plants need because each terrace is different.Kalpana says the best is to keep the garden natural, with honeybees and birds for pollination and controlling pest populations.For watering the plants, I use pitcher irrigation, she says, which does not waste water. She has also used lessons she caught on YouTube, such as planting onions in jars or pots placed at a height from the ground. This keeps out ground pests...

Yet to recover from the crop loss of 2015-16 kharif season, they were forced to go for distress sale of cabbage, tomato and chilli and now it is the turn of potato.The farmers had put all their hopes on potato and looked forward to make up for the loss. Even as potato is being sold for `8 per kg in the open market, the farmers are finding it difficult to even recover the cost of cultivation with traders offering anything between `2 and `3 per kg. In the absence of cold storage, the farmers have no way out but to dispose of the produce at throw away prices.Moreover, the State Government is yet to fix the minimum support price (MSP) for potato despite tall claims of Potato Mission. To make things worse there is no organised market to ensure fair price to the farmers.Under Potato Mission, besides providing incentivised potato seed, the State Government had also committed to give capital subsidy for new cold storage as per the agricultural policy of 2013. It was also mooting subsidising power tariff for existing and new cold storages till March 31, 2018.Plans were also sketched to maintain buffer stock to deal with short-term scarcity situation and a target has been set to bring 60,000 hectares of land under potato cultivation by 2017-18. But, on the ground the picture is not rosy. This year, the Department of Horticulture had distributed 5350 quintal potato seeds to 29 farmers in Bhatli, Bargarh and Attabira blocks.The seeds were meant to produce 424 quintal of potato. This apart, about 500 quintal of seeds were procured from open market and cultivated by farmers across the district. As the situation stands today, many farmers have resorted to distress sale of potato while many are refusing to harvest it as they want to avoid further losses.Premanand Dang of Jamurda village in Bargarh block had cultivated potato over half an acre of land. But, he has no purchaser and is forced to sell his produce at distress prices.Those who had taken debt for the crop were the first to sell their crop at `3 per kg in absence of any organised market in the district. Similar is the condition of Rajkumar Pradhan of the village, who is not daring to harvest his crop in absence of market. Even if he harvests the crop, the amount he would be getting for the produce would not be enough to recover the harvesting cost.Assistant Horticulture Officer, Sunil Kumar Seth said no communication has been received from the State Government on MSP of potato. There was no cold storage in the district and said if farmers wish they can avail the facility in Sambalpur, he added."

Tomato prices touched a high of Rs 42 a kg at vegetable stores in the city on Tuesday. However, it isnt just tomatoes, but other vegetables too whose prices have begun to climb and are expected to become more expensive when summer sets in.In the case of tomato, prices will have to increase as most of the tomatoes sold are coming from Nagpur, said a vegetable store owner who did not wish to be named. It takes around six days for these tomatoes to reach Chennai as they go to Bengaluru first and then come here. The demand for tomatoes is always high and the supply is getting limited, so prices have to go up.He said he was charging Rs 38 for a kg of tomatoes on Monday but since prices increased by Rs 5 at the Koyambedu vegetable market on Tuesday, he had spiked his rate to Rs 42. He explained that the difference in prices at retail and Koyambedu wholesale market is generally around Rs 4 to Rs 5 less a kg for things like tomatoes and can go up to Rs eight to Rs 10 less in the case of vegetables like beans.Vegetable vendors affirmed that most other vegetables have been hovering around the same prices with minor fluctuation. However, they warned that with the beginning of summer, prices too will go up. They attributed this to different reasons, primary one being the water problem in the State.Water shortage will definitely lead to prices being higher this summer, said S Mani, a vegetable vendor at T. Nagar. Prices of vegetables like ladies finger, especially will keep increasing as it is one of the most commonly bought vegetables in summer.He sold the vegetable at Rs 70 per kg on Tuesday. Prices of onion and potato, however, have remained stable. A kilo of onion can be bought for Rs 18-Rs 20 while a kilo of potato is priced Rs 25."

Varghese Vallikkatt received a visitor.His name was George James (name changed). In his early thirties, George was out on bail, after spending five years on a murder charge.George told me that he had been falsely accused, says Fr. Varghese. Now the woman who said she was a witness to the murder has recanted her statement during the ongoing trial. There is a good chance that he will be set free.Fr. George KurukkoorGeorge said that he had become more spiritual in prison. After speaking for a little while George left. Many people who come to the POC feel a sense of peace, says Fr. Varghese. The POC has been in the news because it celebrated its golden jubilee recently. The centre houses the representatives of the three main churches of the Catholic community, namely the Syro-Malankara, the Syro-Malabar and Latin rites. In Kerala, the Catholics comprise about 55 lakh people. The POC has an important mission of bringing all the churches together, says Mar Cardinal George Alencherry. Incidentally, it is also the secretariat of the Kerala Catholic Bishops Council.The idea to set up the Centre came following the second Vatican Council (1962-65), which propagated the idea of the universal church being a community of individual local churches. And the Palarivattom POC got a big push by the late Cardinal Joseph Parecatill who was an ardent supporter of the Indianisation of the church.At the centre, there are 21 Commissions, comprising priests and lay people, which look after subjects like justice, development, youth, labour, health, education, family, and social harmony. Apart from that, regular seminars and conferences take place.We discuss matters connected with our faith and the relationship with the larger society, says Fr. Varghese. What should be our contribution? And what should be our mission at this particular time?Sometimes, there are soul-searching discussions. There have been recurring criticism by the laity about our work in education and health care, and of our institutions becoming commercialised and competing with others, says Fr. Varghese. We had a lot of discussions about our role. And we concluded that we should continue to be involved in educational and health-care, but our mission should be to serve the poorest of the poor.Following the arrest of Fr Robin Vaddakumchiryil, the vicar of the St Sebastian church at Kottiyoor, on sexual abuse charges, there were deliberations on how to ensure a safe environment for minors and vulnerable adults alike.The POC is a good place to have talks thanks to its sprawling campus spread over four-and-a-half acres. There is a main administrative block, a chapel, a residential building for visiting Bishops and priests, a canteen, and a block for the womenfolk.Interestingly, at the back, the priests are growing tomatoes, small gourds, cabbage, cauliflower and bananas. A gaggle of geese, turkeys and ducks can be seen, apart from hens, an emu and a Doberman. At one side, the POC and the Vediyoor Madom Temple share a wall, while on another, it is with the Madavana Panchamoorthi Temple.Asked whether the increasing siege on minorities is a source of worry, Fr. Varghese says, It is a challenging and difficult time, especially in North India. We are a peace-loving people, who have contributed much more to society than the size of our population. But we value as much the union and the solidarity with other communities.The Official Translator Of The ChurchEvery morning, Fr. George Kurukkoor enters a first-floor room at the Pastoral Orientation Centre at Kochi and sits behind a table. There are several glass-paned bookcases on all sides. These contain books in Greek, Sanskrit, Latin, Portuguese, Urdu, Persian, Malayalam, Hindi, and Spanish.There are 46 dictionaries, apart from grammar books of various languages, as well as religions like Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, Jainism and Christianity. Fr. George is the official translator of the Catholic Church in Kerala. And he dips into the books in his library when he is in search of a wood or a phrase. The types of books that I have translated include those dealing with social justice, catechism, the Bible, morals, and constitutions of institutions.The Kerala Catholic Bishops Council selects the books to be translated. According to the Council, all the documents coming from Rome must be translated into Malayalam, and given to the people to read, says Fr. George. But it is not an easy task. A 300-page book in Latin can take three months. That is because I am translating from an Indo-European language to the Dravidian language, says Fr. George. The two families are quite different, so the exact style cannot be retained.Generally, a play of words, old sayings, and unusual grammatical sentences are avoided. If the source language is of the same family, translation is easier. So, Latin to English is easy, while Latin to Malayalam is difficult. So far, Fr George has translated 200 books in 27 years of non-stop work. On any given day, he begins at 8 a.m., and works non-stop - with breaks for lunch, tea, an evening walk and dinner - till 11.30 p.m."

The expo will conclude on Tuesday | Albin MathewKOCHI: Growing 26 different varieties of vegetables in a 1.5-cent plot might seem unbelievable. Not really!An Organic Fair being held at Rajendra Maidan here gives visitors a first-hand demonstration on how this feat can be pulled off - in your backyard or even on the terrace.Nasser M S, a native of Aroor, who grows as many as 26 vegetables, including tomatoes, bitter gourd, ash gourd, tapioca, spinach and pea, in his 600 sqft plot, is ready to share his experience, and has even set up a mini-version of his farm at the ongoing fair.Family farming is a systematic way of cultivation which can provide healthy organic food for a household, making them self-sufficient, says Nasser, who is one of the coordinators of the 12th Organic Fair being conducted by the Organic Charitable Society.Spending half-an-hour daily at the farm is all what is required to produce all vegetables needed for entire family. It is an effective alternative to pesticide-ridden vegetables being sold in the market, says Nasser.The fair, which began on April 7, has many stalls demonstrating innovative ideas in agriculture, including hi-tech farming, precision farming, polyhouse farming, rain-shelter farming, aquaponics and intensive integrated sustainable farming.The fair, being held in collaboration with the Rajagiri Outreach Centre, SH College, Thevara, and St Teresas College, will conclude on Tuesday.Students show the wayStudents of SN Law College, Poothotta, are doing their bit to support the organic way of life. They have put on sale organic fruits and vegetables, collected from their backyards and nearby houses, at the fair.The products include different types of rice, grain and vegetables. Besides, the students also support the tribal communities of Kuttambuzha by selling honey collected by the tribesmen. The proceeds from the sales will be used for the welfare of tribes."

Informing about the concept, head of Rourkela-based Sundargarh-II Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), J Pati, said farmers are provided with financial and technical support to take up cultivation.He said to get good returns, farmers would have to plan cultivation in tune with market demands and the market led agriculture extension programme is a feasible option. Many farmers in the district are resorting to off season cultivation of vegetables in protected environment of poly-houses or shed-net structures and are reaping benefits.It is learnt that under National Horticulture Mission, the Horticulture department is offering heavy subsidy to set up poly-house and shed net structures, while KVK is engaged in providing technical knowhow.Deputy Director, Horticulture (DDH) Basudev Sahu said the popularity of poly-house and shed net structures is slowly picking up. Assistant Horticulture Engineer Alok Adhikari said the district has about four poly-houses over 2,500 sq m and nearly 20 shed-net units over 24,000 sq m. Five shed-net units at Kirei cover 8,000-9,000 sq m.These units through organic farming are successfully producing flowers and major vegetables including cauliflower, cabbage, coloured capsicum, cucumber and banana.A poly-house owner SP Jena said he produces about 20 kg of cherry tomato alone. KVKs horticulture scientist Sanjay Pradhan said during off season, poly-houses are successfully growing seedlings in protected environment, but the shed-net units have their own disadvantages during rainy season."

After working in a royal kitchen for nine years, he moved to the hospitality sector. This is the second time Singhs Rajasthani food festival is being hosted at Bengaluru Marriott Whitefield.From the land of the Maharajas comes 15 dishes that have a range of flavours  sweet, spicy and the many stops in between. The rich cuisine is generous with ghee, yogurt and spices.For the starters, I had Murg Ka Parche and Rai Ki Machli, both are tender and have a distinct flavour. The fish is seasoned with mustard and the Tandoori chicken breasts have a crusty garlicky flavour. Paneer Ke Suley, Dal Pakodi and Mangodi Ki Tikki are hot, soft and filling. The Dahi Vada is fresh and minty.The main course has 11 dishes. Laal Maas, which translates to red meat, is one of the most popular dishes. It is mutton curry cooked in a sauce of curd and spicy red chillies. There is little or no use of tomatoes, just a bit of onions and coriander powder.The traditional Laal Maas shows how Rajasthani cuisine is shaped by spices more than anything else. The red chillies are supplied from a village called Mathonia, about 20 km from Jodhpur. Another dish that stood out was Ker Sangri, made from shoots of a desert plant Khejari. It grows only once a year, during spring time. This is more a pickle with its tangy natural flavour.In Ghatte Ki Subji and Ghatte Ki Pulao, dumplings are made from besan and cooked in a curd gravy. Subz Panchmela is a mix of five sauted vegetables - carrots, cabbage, beans, green peas and spinach.At the end of the line stands a dessert bar. Crunchy, juicy jalebis are also served. The disc-shaped Ghewar oozing ghee is heavenly.The festival is on till April 6. Cost for two: Rs 3,000 plus taxes"

Also, if you are lucky like me, you might even witness a flash mob by the staff on Bollywood chartbusters.Despite the menu sporting dhaaba food, the lip smacking dishes and cocktails are anything but street side and is definitely up in style and Punjabi flavours. Chef Shivam Bose introduced us to the menu that included Paneer Tikka, Veg Galouti and Tandoori Bhune Aloo as starters for vegetarians. For mains, you can pick from Dal Dhaba, Paneer Makhani and Amritsari Chole along with choice of two breads from the menu between Roti, Butter Naan, Lachha Paratha and Naan.For non vegetarian starters, choose from Highway Chicken Tikka, Tawa Mutton and Tawa Chicken. For the mains, pick from Butter Chicken, Rarra Ghost, Kadhai Chicken and Dal Dhaba along with choice of two breads from the menu between Roti, Butter Naan, Lachha Paratha and Naan. For sweet endings, go for some rabri, gulab jamun and phirni.For the Chaat FlavourIf you love chaat flavours, I would recommend you to order Tandoori Bhune Aloo and Paneer Tikka. The paneer cuts through smoothly and is tempered very well with spices. The Bhune Aloo are roasted baby potatoes, tossed in spices and served beautifully with onions and tomatoes. Two of my favourite things  potatoes and tomatoes  put together with roasted flavours and tempered with chaat. Was I a happy woman? Damn, right.While I have heard of Galouti Kebab, I had always perceived as a non vegetarian dish. But here, thanks to chef Shivam, I got a taste of its vegetarian version, where just like the meat one, the vegetable is minced to smoothness through slow cooking, flavoured with cinnamon and black cardamom and placed over a maida crispy base. The galouti is buttery smooth and the base adds the crunch to this dish.The non-vegetarian version of the galouti had lamb minced and cooked to buttery smoothness. The chef definitely earned respect on the dinner table having cooked the meat so well. The effort of the kitchen and its use of technique shows beautiful with this starter.Be it the medium rare Mutton Seekh, the Amritsari Machli or vegetarian starters, the kitchen at Dhaba by Claridges has got its flavours and cooking technique right on the money.The Chitta Butter Chicken is served with white sauce. Flavoured in kasoori methi, this dish is cooked in tandoor with the marination of hung curd and spices. The meat is well cooked and bursts of zesty flavours.The Balti Meat is the houses signature dish, which steals inspiration from the famous mutton curry of dhaba. The curry has all the flavours of a Punjabi house kitchen. Although the gravy looks spicy, at no point do any of the favours overpower the centre-piece sticking out of the bucket serving bowl  the mutton.The Tawa Mutton Pulao has flaky Basmati rice that is tossed in spices and tempered with spices that you will find in any Punjabi kitchen. The dish is light on the stomach and has a fresh mint garnish with well cooked meat pieces. If you are a rice fanatic, do give this one a try.Gujju Dreams Come TrueBeing a Gujarati, I had to ask for the Kadi Pakora, and boy, was I impressed. The thick curd-flour consistency, flavoured well with turmeric and spices, served with pakoras drenched in the gravy won my heart. I definitely missed home a little less with this preparation that is famous across North India.While theres so much to talk about the food, one place where Dhaba by Claridges proves its versatility is the cocktails. They are all flavoured with chaat spices and my God, are the one of the most impressive mixes I have had so far."

At least 30 different innovations in the sector are stuck, pending approvals from the government.While the retail value of the Indian bio-economy is estimated at $35 billion, projects in the agri-biotech industry have failed to receive an impetus.According to data available with the Association of Biotech Led Industries (ABLE), the retail value of bio agri sector sums up to $9.015 billion, out of which $9 billion is accounted for by commercialisation of Bt cotton alone, with no representation of innovation in any other crops, as licences have not been granted for their field testing.The ABLE Agriculture (Able-Ag) has urged the government to relax policy norms, as companies are finding it hard to get approvals for field testing of their innovations.The Centre had mandated organisations to secure no-objection certificates (NOCs) from the respective state governments and in majority of the cases, approvals were being denied, mostly because of a threat perception about Bt crops, according to members of the association.The government needs to open it up for testing, at the very least. Unless these innovations can be tested for their safety, how can the safety concerns around Bt crops be addressed? asked Shivendra Bajaj, executive director, Able-Ag.The projects awaiting approvals include innovations developed by Indian Institute ofHorticulture Research, Sugarcane Breeding Research Institute, Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture, apart from several private companies with regard to crops such as cotton, maize, mustard, corn, sugarcane, papaya and tomato among others.Giving a glimpse into the situation, he said things were getting worse for the technology year-on-year, for the past five-six years.The irony is that much of the data generated in India is being made of use of by other countries. Countries such as Bangladesh, which entered the field much later, are now making use of Bt innovations in agriculture. Every year, they are slowly increasing the cultivation of Bt brinjal. Pakistan has commercialised Bt maize after testing it for several years. In India, it is still pending even though we started testing it way earlier, Bajaj said.As for the safety concerns, Bajaj said India imported edible oils generated from Bt crops in other countries, while back home there was apprehension about allowing the development of these crops."

Well, summer is back, with the mercury hitting new highs since the first week of the month and humidity melting us all into a puddle. And March is not even over! It is going to get worse with the massive loss of tree cover in the city, thanks to Vardah that stormed into the city with a vengeance. CE reporters and photographers take a walk through Chennais hot-spots (pun intended) to give you a glimpse of how the city is coping...Juice ItGoing out between 10 am and 5 pm is an indomitable task during summer. While most of us have the luxury of planning our day around the availability of AC rooms and malls, daily wage labourers, and also street vendors toil away in the sun. Those who sell green coconut, fruit juices and freshly cut fruits, provide relief to the commuters and pedestrians, but they themselves have no place to hide from the harsh sun. Fruit juice shops, road-side kamman kuzhu stalls, buttermilk stalls and rickshaws fi lled with green coconut are common in most parts of the city. What better way to beat the heat than to binge drink on these healthy supplements? With `10 a bowl, fruits and juices keep us hydrated and cools down excess body heat.The Beach For Its LoversDuring Chennai veyil, be wary of getting a tan or worse a sun burn! Many youngsters cover their faces with stoles, cotton gloves and dupattas, especially those riding twowheelers. Radiation can cause blisters and rashes on the exposed areas especially the hands, and even dermatologists suggest gloves while riding or even walking in the sun. As we have studied in our primary schools, it is better to wear cotton dresses than nylon or silk, as the latter might stick to the body because of excessive sweating during summer and cause irritation. Talking about suntans, most today have veered towards natural remedies such as rose-water-lime, turmeric-lime and tomato juice-lime. As the temperature increases, the chances of a sun burn are high. Make sure to cool down as quickly as possible. Keep yourself hydrated, and moisturise the area while its damp and consult a doctor for help at the earliest to avoid severe infections.No Bliss, But Blisters!We Chennaiites dont need a weather update to know that summer is fast approaching. Though many of us prefer to stay indoors, its tradition to visit our beaches  from Marina to Bessy and beyond. Well, defi nitely not to show off the summer bod, but to take a refreshing dip, a quick stroll along the warm sand shore and stopping for some mang-kadalai, sugarcane juice and fresh fruits, later! Even at noon, under the hot sun, our beaches seem crowded with people taking shelter under the carts and kattamarams. But as heat-humidity becomes more oppressive, beaches do get deserted with fewer beach lovers and couples.Time To HyderateAnimals and birds in our neighbourhood too need some clean and fresh water. I am sure every summer, we might have seen birds drink the tiny drops of water that leak from taps or dogs and cats drink from street gutters. Why not help these animals cool down a bit? This summer, collect some water in a clean bowl and leave it on your terrace and outside your gate for your feathered and four-legged friends. This might help them quench their thirst from time to time. Dogs and cats are usually on the look-out to rest in cool shady places; make place for them under your car or your garage. If you own a dog or a cat, and decide to take them along with you for some grocery shopping, DO NOT lock them up in the car with the windows open or closed, they may lose their lives because of the heat trapped within. Avoid taking them out for a walk when the heat is at its peak. Give your dog a trim and brush their fur regularly; it helps them stay cool. For your caged pets, like hamsters, birds, and squirrelsleave their cages in a low-sun area. Let all our pawpals, petpals and community animals and birds have a safe and happy summer!"

His interest in gardening began when he was young, but three months ago, his friends encouraged him to set up a terrace garden. Those few days, it was even hard to get out to buy vegetables. Thats when this idea came about, says the 24-year-old.He has a sprawling terrace garden with a variety of vegetables, fruits and spices. Now I have different variety of spinach, ladies finger, Thai basil, cinnamon, chillies, brinjal, bayleaf, pomegranate and more, he says.An encounter with Bernard D Clerke, a naturalist in Puducherry, helped him learn more about organic farming. The amount of soil in my pots is very less.Instead I use dry leaves- the blackened ones, which turn to soil on decomposing. So in my pots, it's 1/3 of soil and 2/3 of dry leaves. Because of this I dont have to change the soil frequently as the nutrients required for the plants stay intact, he explains.Winston also conducted experiments of his own to understand why dry leaves are important. I had two pots of brinjal. While in one I used coconut husk along with soil, in the other it was with dry leaves. The latter was fresher, he shares. He collects the dry leaves from the poongam tree and neem tree right outside his house.With the city having water shortage, the dry leaves also help in less consumption. The soil is covered with a 15cm bed of dry leaves. I water the plants every morning, the dry leaves absorbs them and keeps the soil moist till the evening, he says.Winston shares that it is important to invite insects as that also helps in plant growth. While small insects can harm the plants, he has a homemade disinfectant for the plants.I make a concoction with turmeric, vasambu (Calamus) and neem leaves. I purchase turmeric sticks and grind them along with vasambu. At home, I boil the neem leaves in water and make it into a concentrated solution. For every 300ml of the solution I add 10 litres of water and the ground powder and pour it over all plants. As both neem and turmeric are good disinfectants they kill the tiny insects that harm the plants, he explains.Winstons friends help him acquire good quality seeds. While this is the first time he has planted so many trees, for the past year he has consumed ladies finger and tomatoes grown at his home. Now, his neighbours are also inspired by him and have started planting trees on the terrace."

Among the ones served here, the tomato tartare is a better choice than its chicken counterpart. Double cooked with mozarella and served with black olive powder, the tartare is delicate.The Free-range Chicken had a unique combination of bell peppers and pecorino romano cheese ice cream. The lightly sweet ice cream with a cheese-like taste is a suprising twist because you dont expect your dessert to sit on the appetisers. But it goes well together.Shrimp -- oven baked and roasted -- are served with white spring onion cream and black truffle, they are a must try. The baked shrimp has a strong orange flavour and the roasted is crispy. The cream of white onions lends the dish a sweet and sour flavour.After the Antipasti is served the Primi Piatti, which is essentially pasta. The lemon foam adds a tanginess to the Fagottini pasta served with burrata, lobster and green peas.The parmigiano reggiano (a hard, granular cheese) aged 24 months is a perfect match for the ravioli. It looks fancy but tastes familiar, like it is homemade. The tomatoes add a zing to the morel mushrooms, green peas and asparagus.Secondi Piatti, another mains, has chicken breast and thigh, spinach, wild mushrooms and pumpkin with rosemary, sauce saracena moscato looks exciting but falls flat with the meat cooked in mushroom sauce rubbery.The sea bass tastes fresh. The platter also includes potatoes prepared in saffron sauce. All good here.Finally, the desserts, or as Italians call it Dolci, include Tiramasu Parfait and Citrus Tart, Cream and Nuts. The chef special Tiramasu is highly recommended, with its overpowering coffee flavour. As you dig into the Tiramisu, the cream oozes out. There is a hint of chocolate.As the name suggests, the tart has a strong citrusy flavour from the layers of lemon cream. It is topped with fruits and nuts. The strawberry is a great add-on, softening the otherwise acidic and sharp flavour of lemon.The reviewed dishes were part of the Capri to Calabria, Southern Italian food festival, which closed on March 24. But, few of them will be included in the restaurants main menu in the coming weeks."

The farmer was first admitted to District Headquarters Hospital at Jajpur town and was later shifted to SCB Medical College and Hospital (SCBMCH) in Cuttack after his condition deteriorated. He is now battling for life at the SCB, sources said.District Collector Ranjan Kumar Das, accompanied by Project Director, DRDA, Braj Gopal Acharya, Sub-Collector Narayan Chandra Dhal, Deputy Director of Agriculture Rajib Lochjan Das, Jajpur Tehsildar Laxmi Narayan Misra and local BDO Haris Chandra Jena visited the village on Friday for an inquiry.During investigation, Kalingas family members and villagers told the investigating team that the young farmer had cultivated tomato, chilli and other vegetables on three acres of land, including 1.5 acres on share-cropping basis. Kalinga had borrowed around `50,000 from his relatives and taken around `1 lakh loan from other private moneylenders at high interest for the crop.But, he was unable to repay the money due to distress sale and crop damage after the untimely rain. The family members claimed that Kalinga was under severe stress due to loan burden following pressure from the moneylenders.The Collector said Kalinga is the sole bread winner of the family as his elder brother is mentally challenged and his father is old. As Kalinga could not return the money to his relatives, the latter informed his father. There was a heated exchange of words between father and son following which an aggrieved Kalinga attempted suicide.Moreover, untimely rain and distress sale were also the contributing factors, Das added.The district administration has given `10,000 to the victims father Prafulla from Red Cross fund for treatment. The Collector has deputed two officials to SCB Medical and has also assured to provide more money from Red Cross to meet the treatment expenses."

The end of line is raking in good moolah for this outlet.Goutom Chatterji, the managing partner, says, Every nine minutes a train arrives, it is like a tsunami has hit the outlet. No one has the time. They just come, order, get their snacks packed and leave to reach office on time. It is a different experience.The outlet opened about two months ago. Sujata Chittiapa, another managing partner says, We studied the station for two months. We observed the crowd that came in. After the connectivity to Mysuru Road, the crowd has increased and it turned out to be better for us.The eatery is open from 9 am to 10.30 pm, until the last train arrives.Goutom claims that the footfall per day is about 1,800 to 2,000. On week days, there are office goers. On weekends, it is usually less as most of them would be families and those who are on joy rides. We earn about Rs 7-9 lakh a month and we pay a rent to BMRCL of about Rs 1.15 lakh, he says.The outlet serves snacks such as vada pav, sandwiches, dahi vada, cakes and hot beverages - tea and coffee.They would soon be including different varieties of tea too.Topped with boondi, their dahi vada is as fresh as it can get. Dipped in a sea of curd, the vada is moist and melts in your mouth as soon as you take a bite.He says, Our specialities are sandwiches, dahi vada, vada pav and cutlets. There are three Mumbaikaars who come here every weekend to have our vada pav. They say this is the closest to the one they get in Mumbai. And it truly does tastes like an authentic Mumbai Vada pav.All items except the bakery confectionaries that includes puff are prepared in batches in their centralised kitchen in C V Raman Nagar, which is just half a kilometre away from the station, he says.Sujata adds, We make food in batches of 30. Once, the items get over. We inform the cooks and within half an hour, a new batch arrives. They are also priced reasonably. The bakery items are outsourced from our friend who owns a bakery.Sujata adds, I am also a dietician. I have always been connected to the food industry. We do not pre-mix sugar in our tea or coffee as there might be some customers who are diabetics too. We provide them sugar separately. Some complain about it while some prefer it.Particular about the hygiene, Goutom challenges, You can walk in to our kitchen anytime without any prior notice and see the hygiene we maintain.If you are a cheese fan, you should definitely try their tomato and cheese sandwich."

Garden enthusiast and the city-based Bharatanatyam exponent Revathi Ramachandran says that having a terrace garden helps in beating the heat, significantly! As we walk through her terrace garden, next to her dance-rehearsal hall, she says, Its wonderful to have a garden so close to the place where you dance. Sometimes my students help me in watering the plants and we even have small fun activities along with rehearsals. And the little ones? They love to eat the mint leaves! she laughs.As we cross the dance hall and open the door to the terrace garden, a gentle fragrance of basil, tulsi, kanakambaram and mint envelops us. Look at those fresh tomatoes! exclaims Revathi. What started as an experiment, gardening became a passion for the danseuse in 2016. It was in early 2016... I had been to an exhibition in Kalakshetra and brought home a gardening kit. It had seed samples of tomatoes and brinjal and thats how I started growing my own veggies, she says. After the first tomato plant flowered, an excited and thrilled Revathi began to grow flowering plants along with fruit-bearing ones. Now she had chilies, capsicum, papaya, ladies finger and avarakai, among others. I use veggies from my garden for cooking and most of the flowers are used to decorate the idols of Gods and Goddesses,she says.With guidance from a neighbour  Sumitra and, Prabhu, who runs a solar nursery in Mandeveli  Revathi set up an elaborate terrace garden. As a child, I remember having a huge garden with big coconut and mango trees, and a big malli poo pandhal. It is difficult to have such sprawling gardens when you are living in apartments, but even a small space is enough to have your own green space and thats the need of the hour! she says, smiling.Revathi grooms her plants every other day and she enjoys doing it. I love spending time here, she says, and adds laughing, But, sometimes it becomes unmanageable.Jasmine, Arali, Mana thakali keerai and Nithyakalayani or myrtle are other plants that adorn her garden. Nithyakaluyani is said to be very good for patients with cancer. All you have to do is boil the petals in water and drink the water and its said to do wonders, she says.She uses 100% organic fertilisers. I dont get time to make my own... I buy them... turmeric water, panchagavya, neem oil and ashes we get after doing a homamare very good for the plants and keeps insects away, she says.With a busy schedule throughout the year, how does she find time for her garden? She shares an incident. I was travelling across the country for a dance performance and, when I came back, the few plants I had had withered. No one had watered them and that was the deciding point for me... I knew I had to spend at least a few hours with them every day. Be it rains, the draining heat or even during the infamous Vardha cyclone, Revathi says she makes sure that she protects her garden. I sit here even if its high noon, she says. The plants keeps the place cool."

The raw bananas are from Shivamogga, capsicums from Mandya, tomato from Kolar, beans from Tumkuru, lemons from Chitradurga.The over 8 million Bengalureans buy close to 5,000 tonnes of vegetable in a day. One can however, take to community farming to avoid buying vegetables from far off land.Popular in the West, Community farming is the way of growing food crops collectively by a group of people, for their own consumption either in a private or public place. In the United States such spaces are known as Victoria gardens.The term market garden and gorilla gardens also means community garden.Community gardening is one of the best ways to grow our own food in the urban area. They help build connections between people, nature and their neighbourhood. In community gardening, a group of people from the same community can do gardening in a common place and share the produce.Use Public SpacesPublic places such as parks, government common areas, school premises and temple garden spaces could be converted into community gardens. The growers can collectively share and work on timings that suit them the best. Some community gardens are maintained by paid gardeners who work in the space all day carrying out regular activities such as watering and weeding.Brings Community TogetherThey sow, harvest and engage in other gardening activities with their family members, and friends. This will be a great entertainment as well as they are contributing to the society by producing their own food.The daily need of greens, vegetables, and some fruits can be easily fulfilled with these gardens. Greens can be grown and harvested in a month.Tomatoes, bhindi, brinjal, beans, chillies, capsicum and gourds such as cucumber, pumpkin, snake gourd can be grown easily in the community gardens. It is very simple to grow the vegetables, without any chemicals and pesticides. Enriched soil is the first step of having a healthy plant.Growing marigold plants, mixed crops of herbs and vegetables, companion plants with pulses will aid in growing healthy plants.Community gardens would be a perfect choice for the city folks to grow more from the available spaces.For more information on urban farming and any related queries, please contact the author at nalini@artyplantz.com."

You love coding and building cool system applications no matter how frustrating it gets.Manikanta G with a friend atManyata Tech Park; VasanthKaje at his farmSo, how does a techie beat stress? Well, a few techies in the city have the answer -- getting downright dirty to relieve stress. These Bengalureans have ventured into workplace farming.Nidhi Singh, 28, used to look forward to coffee breaks at work, have a shot of her daily dose of caffeine, but now, it is all about the greens. I have stopped those coffee breaks now and spend time with my plants instead, says the Nokia employee.Freshers on the FarmNidhi grows her favourite vegetables fenugreek and baby corn at a farming plot near her office. Since she has no experience in agriculture, she relies on the Internet to research on what to grow and how. It has been a great experience so far, says the techie who holds a Masters in Computer Application.I had never grown vegetables before. I didnt think I would be able to grow as many vegetables as I have in this small plot, she says. She has reaped her first harvest and says it feels awesome. I harvested spinach and baby corn recently, but I still see it growing well with each passing day as I walk by to work, adds Nidhi.For the Love of Palak PaneerNaveen Kumar Ts love for palak paneer might be one of his inspirations behind growing spinach near his workspace. The IBM employee, who has no prior farming experiences, is also growing ladies finger along with spinach.For Naveen, it is all about building a green consciousness. As pollution takes a toll and with trees being chopped down to make way for concrete structures, he is more than willing to help the environment however he can. I am happy that I have contributed in some way, he says.Savithri Radhakrishnan, a software professional at IBM, believes farming to be a great stress buster. It is not just about work stress, but in general theres a lot going on in everyones life and theres no denying that seeing something grow productively that you have sown makes you feel content and theres a joy in that, she says.Dirt to DestressManikanta G, an employee at Kinapse Ltd, agrees. He recently finished harvesting his produce that he grew outside his office.  I am really happy with my harvest. I got a good yield, says the 28-year-old who works as a regulatory affairs associate.He distributed his produce among colleagues. While he is new to farming, he had always wanted to venture into its organic side.It has been a great journey so far, he says, adding It relaxes me. So, has it brought down the work stress? Yes, a 100 per cent, says Manikanta.Nidhi, who made methi paratha and aloo curry out of her harvest and shared it with colleagues, also credits organic farming at work for relieving her stress. The activity has impacted positively on her emotional health too, she says.Change in PerspectiveMy perspective towards food has changed ever since I started this. I now respect the process of growing food and comprehend the struggle that farmers go through, she adds. Through lessons from her workplace farming, Nidhi now grows saplings in her apartment.Naveen, who has completed his first harvest cycle and is awaiting the next, calls the practice an excellent stress buster. My stress levels have plummeted since I started, he says.Spread across three blocks at Manyata Embassy Business Park, this agricultural land has become a stress buster for employees working in the tech park. The Urban Green initiative was introduced to techies to relieve them of work stress and help them learn about agricultural practices. The primary idea behind this initiative is to provide a low-cost way to give our office parks users the opportunity to go back to the land and incentivise the growing of safe food, says Pradeep Lala, CEO, Embassy Services.So far the employees have harvested spinach, chakotha, coriander, amaranthus, fenugreek, baby corn, brinjal, green chilli, ladies finger and tomato. The project is set to be extended to 250 more plots of 30 sq ft each. The intiative is the brainchild of horticulture manager Kiran DT.Farming BreaksBengaluru-based programmer Shashi, 25 finds going to the fields relaxing. Whenever I go home, I make sure I go to our farm and work there. We grow rice, sugarcane and vegetables, he says.While his breaks for farming arent as frequent as coffee breaks, Shashi does make it a point to have a brief stint at the farm twice a month.Vasanth Kaje, 35, a former senior project manager at Infosys, has now turned a big plot of land back home into farm. He calls it Kaje Vrukshalaya. He took up farming while still working for another IT firm, but quit the job when the balance tilted more towards farming.All tech jobs are aimed at selling better conveniences to humans at the cost of Natures and employees own health. But this comes in various disguises and some are hard to make out. I realised it over a period of time and opted for a return journey to the farmland where I grew up, he says.While Vasanth acknowledges that farming helps him relax he says that it is the duty of every human to grow his or her food. A large section of society leaching a few farmers will eventually lead to the collapse of the system, he adds."

But we are too familiar with the soaked-in-cheese variant and slightly localised taste. In Italy, the wood-fired bread is served with minimal toppings - garlic, herbs, fresh mozzarella and basil on sparsely smeared tomato sauce. And if are interested to take a bite of the real, authentic pizza, head straight to Slice of Italy, the Italian food festival at Hilton Garden Inn. Though a variety of pizzas are available now, the classic Italian pizza is an uncomplicated preparation of a few delicious ingredients, says the chef.Italy has clear-cut concept of meal structure where the diners indulge in an array of dishes in proper succession rather than sticking to a simple one or two courses. So a typical meal starts with minestrone soup, followed by Patate al forno, Spinachi alla Milanese, Spring green risotto, Beef braciole andChicken marsala. It starts with the antipasto (appetizer), to a first course of pasta or other starches, a main dish of meat or fish with a simple side of vegetables, followed by salad, cheese and fruit, coffee, and possibly a digestive, says the chef.He adds that Italian food is a surprisingly diverse cuisine and each of the twenty Italian regions has a distinctive set of flavours, recipes, products, and ingredients. Across all regions, Italian dishes are straightforward preparations of a few choice ingredients, which are artfully combined. Its basically the climate and geography that defines local cuisine, he says. So the creamy risotto is from the Northern regions, while the south boasts of bright olive oil and tomato-based recipes. They make the best beef steaks in Tuscany, from choice cattle raised in the Chianina Valley. There are unique ingredients like truffle mushrooms, special wines, cured meat (salami), and handcrafted cheese. You will also find a wide regional assortment of breads and pastas. Italian breads differ significantly in size, taste, and texture. There are large, chewy loaves and thin, crunchy sticks, he says.Coffee and desserts are definitely part of the meal as the Italians cherish a soft spot for expresso drinks. Gelato Cookies, cakes, pastries, tarts and a lot others are usually enjoyed with coffee. There are some more exotic others like panettone, a buttery egg-bread laced with dried fruit and candied citrus which takes hours to make. Slice of Italy is on till March 26. Walk in anytime between 7 pm and 11 pm."

I feel I learn something new every day in the kitchen, be it experimenting with flavour profiles, creating a unique dish and recipe, or trying an ingredient we have never tasted before.As I belong to the community of Chettiar from Chettinad which is famous for its hospitality, so I believe cooking for people and hosting them, comes naturally to me.My earliest memory of cooking was with my mom where we made a lot of fish dishes in Chettinadu style. I would always help her with the preparation especially for our elaborate weekend meals which included cleaning and prepping fish. She has always been my inspiration and I still follow her tips even when experimenting with some unique ingredients in the kitchen.As my mom would always stress on adding vegetables to any dish even to non-veg, to make kids eat vegetables along with their favourite fish or meat, I have always tried to follow the same to make sure my guests consume a good quality of nutrients along with the food.By taking inspiration from this, I prepared a dish that combines my love for sea food and the Mediterranean cuisine and is what I call, a one pot meal. With carbs, protein, veggies, retaining their individual original flavour and yet with the help of simple spices, each morsel becomes a gastronomic delight.The dish was conceptualised to showcase a popular species of fish called Humour, common in the Gulf and combines all that is essential to any Mediterranean country and is the core of their everyday food such as olives, semolina, olive oil, cherry tomatoes that give a fresh look and taste to the dish and come together to enhance the experience of this fish dish.Food more than its flavour, is a tradition, it is a rare blend of culture and emotion, and it is an art crafted to create an emotional connection. Seeing guests walk out of your restaurant with a big smile on their face and having them enjoy the meal is an amazing feeling.I believe, as a chef, I am always obliged in promoting a healthy society and I find it amazing to take up such a huge responsibility even though the hours are long and the pressure is immense, the rewards are massive."

Additionally, China has blocked the import of dry fruits and dates from Afghanistan, hitting the trade here badly.Since the beginning of this year, our export of tomatoes, garlic and soya bean to Pakistan has been hit badly. For last two months, the Pakistani authorities did not unload 43 trucks of garlic sent from here. The crop was lying at the Integrated Check Post (ICP) at Attari. Such is the condition of hundreds of trucks of soya bean that were refused by the health authorities of Pakistan citing that these were not fit for consumption, said president Karyana and Dry Fruit Association (Amritsar) Anil Mehra told the New Indian Express.Now they are not allowing tomatoes from here citing the same reason. Tomato prices in Pakistan have gone as high as Rs 150 per kg. The Pakistani authorities have even issued TV advertisements recommending the use of curd instead of tomatoes while cooking, he added.The issue has also affected the 35-year-old trade relation between Afghanistan, from where India imports dry fruits and dry dates regularly. India gets only cement and gypsum from Pakistan and Afghanistan now, Mehra said.If Pakistan does not want to continue trade relations with India due to pressure from its radicals, India should withdraw the status awarded to Pakistan as its most favoured trading partner.The negative sentiment between both the countries is not good for trade. There is a possibility of a decline in the trade relations between the countries in the coming days. Pakistan has already stopped importing perishable goods from us, said Rajdeep Singh Uppal a leading exporter and former chairman of Confederation of Indian Industry (Amritsar Zone).India mainly imports cement, gypsum, dry fruits, rock salt from Pakistan while it exports meat, vegetables, soya meal, raw cotton, yarn to Pakistan."

The video conspires that massive quantities of coagulated blood, which is a side product of the meat industry, is brought to the factories that make ketchup.In the next step, the video says that the blood is mixed with a narcotic drug cocaine and urine, where its is supplied directly from the sewer line itself. The video even bears the insignia of Science channel. The creator of the fake video has used the original video of making ketchup and has dubbed a voice-over that changes the description and the name of the ingredients.In reality, tomato ketchup is prepared from red ripe tomatoes, distilled vinegar, high fructose corn syrup, salt, selected spices, onion powder, and natural flavoring."

I have always been a foodie and hailing from the South of Tamil Nadu, I had the opportunity to taste and relish a wide array of cuisines  from Madurai to Virudunagar and Tirunelveli, I have savoured it all! But becoming a chef was never a planned decisionone led to another and I got into hotel management. Gradually, I became fascinated with the profession and here I am!I love travelling and in the last two decades, I have travelled to many countries. Specialising in the European and Mediterranean cuisine happened through all my travel-cum-food expeditions (smiles). One such memorable experience was in Mauritiusworking with chefs there taught me the nuances of cooking delicious Mauritian food. The usage of herbs and spices in Mauritian dishes are similar to that of Indian cuisine  turmeric, cardamom, thyme, curry leaves and coriander are most common. Sounds similar to what we use, doesnt it? Yes, they like spicy food too.But for me, developing my skills in cooking has always been experimentation and if I have to reveal something about my home kitchen experiencehere goes: I have never entered the kitchen at home! My wife and mother dont let me enter the kitchen (laughs).I have a keen interest in learning new thingsand my love for trying out organic food is beyond words. In fact, I use organic materials for my preparations and I even have an organic farm in the hotel. We grow our own veggies and herbs. The freshness of ripe organic tomatoes and brinjal can be experienced only when you taste it!I support organic food and I try and help local cultivators with their produceits their livelihood.I do a lot of molecular and progressive cooking, plus, I fuse cuisines  Indian with a touch of European and so on. When it comes to my personal preference, my palette is simple. A bowl of rice with rasam and vegetable is enough for me to savour and relish.But I have a confessionI have a sweet tooth! I love the velvety chocolate pudding and chocolate marquiseanything with chocolate and cheese  I am all for it (chuckles). The Tuscan brick chicken, which is heated over a brick, on a grill and the lamb loin are my specialties. The brick chicken has a rustic taste and aroma and is a brilliant choice.Like I said, I rarely cook for my family and I enjoy eating their food. If theres something I would like to prepare for them, it would be the classic mutton biriyani  made in the traditional way  with seeraga sambha rice, and of course, hand-ground masalas.Its always been my dream to do a back-pack trip across Europe and learn their traditional food. What we see in menus here are just a part of itapart from this, there are several authentic cuisines. Similarly, in India, not many know that there is something beyond Chettinad in South. Theres Nilgiris, Madurai, Virudhunagar, Kongunadu cuisine and many more. If I were to retire and cook a particular cuisine for the rest of my life, I would definitely choose Indian."

His convincing abilities, his company Akvos green attitude and my intrinsic need to grow food, saw me hauling the first few bags of soil and vermi-compost up the lift to the fifth floor on July 17 last year. The entire staff were a hands-on part of the initial setting up. Barely forty days into our green journey, Shiv, the office cook, had started harvesting fresh organic vegetables every other day and the staff were also taking home some vegetables.Apart from brinjals, tomatoes, mint, palak and lettuce, we soon added chillies, pak choy, three varieties of beans, okra and cherry tomatoes to our regular harvests.Converting this beautiful harvest into food was an amazing feeling. Along with bountiful harvests, we experienced a fair share of pests which we managed with some simple organic solutions. Come winter and we will have our patch sported loads of new crops like coloured radishes, rockette, potatoes, beets, more greens, cabbages, cauliflowers and broccoli.

He and several of his friends replied - from the supermarket! That completely freaked me out! she exclaims. That made her decide to grow vegetables in her house as a personal choice. I wanted my son to know where his food comes from.This was also partly because she felt that children form a certain socio-economic background and above were disconnected from the earth.  In fact, we tell children not to play in the soil! That was the impetus for me to do this on a certain scale in my house and introduce my friends to it too! And once youve tasted something you ve grown, nothing ever tastes the same,she adds.Today in her own garden both in her courtyard and on the terrace, she experiments with the same using waste produce such as coconut shells and sugarcane waste. It so happens that my professional life and personal life became intertwined!In her courtyard she has a mix of ornamental as well as fruit-bearing plants including banana, papaya, nochi (which is a mosquito repellant).Because I have so many trees, I even have varieties of birds coming - including a sun bird couple - and lots of butterflies! In her first floor balcony are quaint additions like saunf, lemon grass, chicken spinach, basil and such. But her real harvest is on the terrace where she had cultivated her own rooftop farm. She proudly plucks a few pink radishes and displays them.. Salad leaves, pasala keerai, chillies, red ladies fingers, tomatoes of several varieties, carrots....at my sons school(where she has introduced the programme) the tomatoes are as big as a pomegranate! she exclaims. She also does a lot of seed- saving to obtain seeds from plants.If I am told something will not grow in Chennai , I absolutely have to try it. But most importantly I want everyone in my family and others to know how easy it is to do it. For example, I now make my own Bokashi bran (used in composting) on my own, she laughs.

But while many Indians have directed Sri Lankan movies, only three Sri Lankans have directed Indian films so far.The three Sri Lankans are: Batticaloa-born Balu Mahendra, maker of the prize winning Veedu, Sandhya Ragam and Thalaimuraigal; Punguduthivu-born V.C.Guhanathan, who turned out commercially successful films like Thanikkattu Raja and Michael Raj; and Ratnapura-born Vimukthi Jayasundara, who has made the Bengali art film Chatrak.Of the these, Vimukthi Jayasundara is unique for two reasons: he is the first Sinhalese to direct an Indian movie, and also the first Sri Lankan to make a film in Bengali.Chatrak (Mushrooms), made in the tradition of the renowned Bengali film maker Ritwik Ghatak, was shown in the prestigious Directors Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival in 2011, and also at the Toronto, Pacific Merdian and Vladivostok international film festivals.Within a screening time of 90 minutes, Chatrak brings out significant aspects of the realities of urban India as seen in the metropolis of Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), in which corporate interests determine the pattern of growth irrespective of social consequences, and where ambitions to succeed as per the parameters of the day, tear the social fabric and create traumas.The film shows how values promoted by the corporatization of the economy and society lead to conflicts, isolation, remorse, disappointments, irreversible mental imbalance and even suicidal tendencies. The situation created by corporatization leads to the creation of roles and duties which are performed mechanically and often brutally. But even so, remorse creeps to the surface on occasion because, after all, the denizens of the modern world are, at the core, human beings, not automatons.Chatrak is about architect Rahul (played by Sudeep Mukherjee); his long-time love interest Paoli (played by Paoli Dam); Rahuls unnamed deranged brother (played by Sumeet Thakur); and a foreign border-guard (Tomas Lemarquis).Rahul goes to Dubai, like millions of other Indians, to earn a decent pay packet. But his younger brother fails in his attempt because of his disability. Dejected, the young man seeks refuge in the thickness of a tropical jungle. Since this happens to be at the border of another country, the border guard (Tomas Lemarquis) notices him, and after a brutal struggle, pins him down. But it does not take him long to realize that both had been pushed into doing what they were doing - killing people brutally in his case, and going abroad by hook or by crook to earn a living in the case of the young man. The two alienated souls strike an unusual camaraderie.Given the mushrooming construction of luxury condominiums in Kolkata, Rahul comes back from Dubai and takes up a job on one of the sites. The growing inequalities in Kolkata, the pauperization of the already poor original residents of the many construction sites; and his indifference to his brothers fate, gnaw at Rahuls conscience. These also lead to a disconnect with Paoli. But she doesnt want to leave him, despite his saying that she would be better off without him.Rahul and Paoli go looking for the brother, guided by typically Indian do-gooders. Finally they locate him in a thick jungle and bring him home to live with them. But the deranged brother, having forgotten social mores, becomes an embarrassment and the couple take him back to the jungle. But Rahul continues to be deeply troubled. In a moment of frenzy, he dives from the top of the concrete tower he was building.In a conversation with this writer after a special screening of the film in Colombo recently, the 40 year old Director, Vimukthi Jayasundra, revealed how he hit upon the idea of making a film in Bengali, how he got people to back it, and how he chose the subject for the film.Born in the sylvan surroundings of Ratnapura in 1977, Vimkuthi did not want to be a doctor or engineer but a painter. Eventually I settled for film making, which in many ways, is like painting, he said.And he was in love with India.I used to go to India frequently. I drew spiritual sustenance from it as a disciple of Jaggi Vasudev at his Isha Yoga ashram in Coimbatore. I travelled far and wide in India and made many friends in the film world. As a student at the Film and Television Institute in Pune, I saw a lot of films and was particularly fond of Bengali film makers Satyajit Ray and Ritwik Ghatak, Vimukti said.Back in Sri Lanka, the war was on. Vimukthi made a documentary film for the government on wounded soldiers. In the process of making the film he realized how some people are made to sacrifice their lives and limbs for somebodys else cause.As for the idea of making a film in India, it came up at a meeting with his long standing friend, Bappaditya Bandhopadhyay, a producer and director of Bengali films, in Kolkata. Bappaditya said he could rope in Vinod Lahoti, a Kolkata film enthusiast and financier, to fund the venture.The subject and story line were left to me. But Bappaditya was always around to tell me what is not correct. He would also point his finger at cinematic clichs, and tell me to knock them off, Vimukthi said.On choosing the subject and story he recalls: I hadnt clue about what to portray. So, I decided to roam the streets of Kolkata day after day, observing the lives of the people in various parts of the city at various times. What struck me at the time, was the mushrooming of posh high rise buildings in sharp contrast to the squalor around. I saw the sharp differences existing between the rich and the poor and how the poor were duped into parting with their agricultural land for small sums of money on the promise of jobs on the construction sites.From the middle classes he learnt about their aspirations and problems. I also found that at least a section of Kolkata society was aware that people were being taken for a ride, but others were indifferent.There is a scene in the film in which an old man is trying to wake up a younger man sleeping under a bridge by telling him how the British bought the three villages which became the nucleus of the imperial city of Kolkata for a mere Rs.1,300 and that a similar thing is happening now, he pointed out.Vimukthi also saw how, despite grinding poverty, lack of employment, insanitary conditions and the mad rush to modernize Kolkata, people stuck to traditions tenaciously as seen in the annual Durga Puja celebrations. Beg or borrow, the puja had to be conducted is a grand way. The pujas cathartic effect on the participants was brought out vividly in Chatrak.In the story, the main facets of Kolkatas physical and socio-economic landscape were portrayed through the lives of the successful but troubled architect, his independent-minded lady love, and the deranged younger brother. Vimukthi has portrayed India in all its complexity, both gross and nuanced.Asked why the architect does not die even after jumping from a multi-storied building, for he eventually opens his eyes, Vimukthi said:  I wanted to suggest that there could be renewal of hope,As Rahul re-awakens, a tortoise at the construction site which has been in hiding because of the destruction of its habitat, also emerges from its shell, symbolically."

From investing in coco peat to growing bags, every self taught or professional gardener is looking for ways to use the space around them for better. Bharathi Iyer, 34, who works for the Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation also maintains a rooftop garden. She explains how Facebook is invariably helping her learn about gardening through the groups. I have been gardening for the past two years now. I was doing gardening on a vacant plot next to my house. But since they started construction work there, I shifted to the roof.Bharathi grows all varieties of beans, (aubergines) brinjals, tomatoes and greens on her roof top. I also grow certain flowers alongside the vegetables as they help in pollination, she says. She presently grows five varieties of roses  Bengaluru Rose, button roses, yellow rose, pink roses and blood red roses.Along side these flowers, she has varieties of hibiscus, balsams and gladiolas in her garden. Bharathi seeks inspiration after her mother who used to grow different varieties of flowers. She then decided to take to vegetable gardening and hence has been acquiring inputs from various sources who assist her in gardening. Bengaluru has several urban farmers groups.I found my motivation there. I was very new to the concept of grow bags. It was on Facebook that I interacted with different people and learned so many things about gardening.says Bharathi.Bharathi explains that vegetable growing and flower rearing go hand in hand. For pollination to occur, you require other plants. The flowers will attract the pollinators. They will attract butterflies, honeybees and ants. I realised it is a co-existence. Bharthi also elucidates the formula she learnt to grow plants. Leaves, roots and flowers. The garden has to be formed in this formula. You can't simply plant one range of brinjals and tomatoes and expect pollination to occur, she says.When asked about her views on farming in limited spaces in the city, Bharathi says, Lack of space is a constraint. But farming can be done almost anywhere. If you have a 3 x 6 feet space, you can grow veggies which fit in that area. I have seen people farming in PVC pipes. I didn't know that was possible, until I saw it. Adding to it she also states that people are afraid of failing in their attempts at farming. Farming requires more perseverance than any other profession, she says further.Bharathi treats her plants as her children and takes great pride with her harvest. She actively involves her family in the gardening activities too."

I often have clients come to me wondering what this diet is all about and if it is even effective? - Well, to begin with, the objective of eating more raw foods is to nourish the body with nutrients in an easy-to-digest manner, one that the body is naturally built for. It is about eating mostly or all unprocessed and uncooked food so that the body gets all the nutrients without harmful additives or losing nutrients through various cooking methods. As a nutritionist, I would definitely recommend the raw food diet but it has to be had as a part of a balanced nutrition plan that supports regular exercise.In a study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine in 2005, researchers compared 18 people on a strict raw food diet with 18 on a typical American diet. After four years, body mass index - a measure of body fat - and midsection fat were lower among those in the raw food group than those in the other group.There are numerous variations of the raw food diet and the best part is, that you have the power to create one on your own. Generally, about 75 per cent of what is you eat will be raw and never heated above 46 degree Celsius. It is very rare for people to follow a 100-percent raw diet from the start and hence, below is a simple guide on how to take baby steps towards a healthy lifestyle by consuming raw foodEat Almonds DailyLoaded with nutrients and that satisfying crunch, almonds make for an ideal choice of snack when you are on a raw diet plan. A handful of almonds may have satiating properties that promote feelings of fullness, which may keep hunger at bay between meals. So whether at home, work or on the go, a handful (30 grams/23 pieces) of almonds are a convenient snack that can be eaten anywhere, any time of the day and through the year.Be a Pro at JuicingLearn the art of blending and juicing. Fruits and vegetable juices can give a good start to the diet. Fruit juices contain essential minerals and vitamins that can help keep you refreshed through the day. Vegetable juices can help improve your immunity and boost energy. Moreover, they do not take a lot of time to prepare and are affordable.Less is MoreTry not to shock your system by changing the food it receieves all of a sudden. Include nutrient-rich raw food gradually in your diet plan. Try to start small with a few items and include something new daily, weekly or monthly. This will allow your body time to adjust to the new diet with fewer chances of withdrawal and falling off the wagon. This will also help ease the new process for your digestive system and before you know it, your body would have not only accepted the new diet but has also started providing the desired results.Seeds to the RescueConsuming seeds of sunflower,sesame and pumpkin can help you get the right nutrition. The seeds have many essential nutrients like vitamins and fibre and they are delicious to flavour with simple and easily available organic masalas and spices.Veggies the Raw WayInclude vegetables like carrots, celery, peppers, tomatoes, etc in their raw forms. We all know vegetables play a vital role in our diets, as they support the normal functioning of the different body systems.

Born and brought up in Tuscany, the chef brought an interesting amalgamation of choicest dishes at the Italian Food Festival, ongoing at Deccan Pavilion, ITC Kakatiya.I try to keep everything classic, said the chef as we savoured Chicken and Bocconcini Salad bright in colour with the use of baby spinach, ripe tiny tomatoes and, of course, the delicious mild cheese which blended really well with the chicken chunks. It was appetising enough. Chefs mastery was in Cauliflower and Almonds Soup. The liquid was silken, the texture smooth dusted with crunchy almond flakes.The taste was perfect with all the flavours blended in  the layers amalgamated with one another, and the soup immediately appeared to be a comfort food.We have so many vegetarian food items in Italian cuisine. Whats grown in the kitchen-garden of an Italian goes into his plate, shared chef as we commented on a vegetarian dish to be so delicious. A lot of Italian food promotions drip with overuse of cheese and olives, thankfully the simplicity and classicism of this food festival made it exclusive and exquisiteness.The dessert, the evergreen Tiramisu, won our hearts with its freshness. Its the use of country eggs, lady fingers  the sweet sponge biscuits, rum, coffee, Kahlua that makes this dessert special.

Two agriculture department officers, one of them now retired, were sentenced to three years imprisonment with a fine of Rs 10,000 each for cheating the government of Rs 48.Pollachi Judicial Magistrate I R Pachiyappan found horticulture officer G Nithyanandham and then field demonstration officer in Pollachi I Subramaniam guilty of cheating the government of Rs 48 by creating fake documents in October 2002. Nithyanandham is still working with the department in Coimbatore.Under the seed subsidy scheme, the State government had given Rs 48 as a subsidy for one kg of tomato seed. Both the officers had created a fake document in the name of Vijayakumar, a farmer-cum-advocate in Pollachi, and forged a signature.The issue came to light after Vijayakumars name was included in the list of beneficiaries at the Coimbatore horticulture department office notice board.On learning about this, Vijayakumar lodged a complaint at the Kinathukkadavu Police Station. It was later transferred to Pollachi East Police Station in 2005. The case was under trial at the Pollachi JM-I court since 2005. On Thursday, Magistrate Pachiyappan convicted Nithyanandham and Subramaniam, and sentenced them to three years imprisonment, besides slapping a fine of Rs 10,000 on each of them.Assistant Public Prosecutor M Suresh told Express that the duos fraudulent act was not known to their seniors as they both were responsible for receiving the applications from farmers."

We have the starchier and blander versions but in other countries there are the more pungent recipes from vegetables, beans and greens. They are known to contribute to the gut-health and many people live by them. Hot and biting, these foods can serve well as substitutes for the highly-salted pickles. They can be served as sides or appetisers.Kimchi (Korea)This is mostly made of cabbage, which has to be left to ferment for a week. The chopped leaves are mixed with fish sauce, scallions and garlic and kept in a cool air-tight container. You may need to lose the cap once in a while to let the gases that form escape. Kimchi can be used as a sauce for other veg and seafood preparations. You can get it in Korean and Chinese restaurants such as Hae Kum Gang in Ashok Nagar, Arirang in Kamanahalli and Shiro in UB City.Gundruk (Nepal)Greens such as leaves of either mustard or raddish are shredded and left in earthenware containers. The blackish mushy gundruk is served as a side dish, an appetiser and even mixed with soups. To prepare as soup, the leaves are friend along with thinly sliced onions, tomatoes and the usual Indian spices like turmeric. You could try it at Bameys Resto Cafe in Kormangala.Kombucha (Japan)It is a fermented tea drink and made using SCOBY, which is symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast. This is a mildly sweet drink with a bit of fizz. There is a miniscule percentage (single digit) of alcohol and unless you glug down many litres of it, you wont get a high. This drink is credited with curing everything from diabetes and depression to AIDs and cancer, but these claims are unproven. Get it at Adi Naturals in JP Nagar, Era Organics in Sanjaynagar or Green Channel in Ali Asker Road.Sauerkraut (China, Russia)This is a blander form of pickled cabbage made with carroway seeds and salt. Few people put onion too with this mixture, but this depends on how strong you would like the flavour to be. This is recommended for the lactose-intolerant to get their dose of good bacteria for gut health. Served at Soo Ra Sang, behind Leela Palace.Natto (Japan)It is made from soybeans. This is strong smelling and was earlier made by storing the beans in a haystack. The method of preparation has changed and these are now mass-produced, available in tin cans like baked beans. This is said to be high in fiber, Vitamin K and C and minerals. Nato is cooked with soya sauce and served with boiled rice. Available at Harima on Residency Road."

Absence of cold storage and lack of government help has forced them to opt for distress sale. Many of them had taken loans to grow the crops.A piece of cauliflower that was earlier selling for Rs 9 to Rs 10 till last week, has now come down to Rs 4. We are forced to sell those at low prices as there is no cold storage facility, said Babaji Charan Nayak, a cauliflower grower of Artia Kusunpur.Farmers have not even been able to recover the input and labour cost either. We are worried about repayment of loans now, said Nayak. Like him, Biswanath Sahu of Rasulpur block had cultivated cauliflowers in one acre of land after taking a hand loan of Rs 20,000 at 30 per cent interest. Due to the low market price, I am unable to recover the input cost from the cultivation, he said.In the last crop season, cauliflowers were grown in areas of Kharasrota-Brahmani delta region mainly consisting of Rasulpur, Dharmasala, Jajpur and Bari blocks in the district. Over 10,000 farmers of the area are into vegetable cultivation. Sources said farmers have cultivated cauliflowers, cabbage, brinjal, carrot, cucumber and tomatoes over 30,000 hectares of land in the area in last crop season. Farmers bring them to the daily market at Barabati and other nearby weekly haats for selling.Sources said there is no Government-run cold storage in the entire district. There is a private cold storage at Chhatia in Barachana block but small farmers cannot afford to store their vegetable there. Construction of another cold storage at Panikoili is yet to be completed, while another at Jaraka is lying in a dilapidated condition. A horticulture official said work on Jaraka cold storage started few months back while the unit at Panikoli is expected to get completed by March this year."

They claimed that after the US and European countries, this commercial type of Aeroponics farming is the first initiative in the country.Every day, 900 kg of vegetables of 18 varieties which include tomato, brinjal, ladies finger, beans, carrot and potato, are produced using 30,000 sq ft space under the Aeroponics farming system located at Sengodampalayam near here.Aeroponics is a process of growing plants in an air and mist environment, without the use of soil. The set-up would be housed inside a green house structure, with a state-of-the art refrigeration system. A completely closed greenhouse with 40 per cent sunlight penetration, 60 per cent sunlight diffusion, covered ground with mounted, automated pulse irrigation and automated climate management are salient features.Sankar had developed the Aeroponics system in 2013. After a study to standardise the farming method for the climatic condition, he formulated procedural calculation in 12 parameters such as room temperature, relative humidity, carbon-dioxide level, sunlight intensity, shadow effect, water temperature, water nutrient and PH value in water.Around 6,000 litres of water would be enough to cultivate 900 kg of vegetables a day. Water would be sprayed intermittently at the root of the crops the whole day. The crops absorb only 2,000 litres as a top up, and the remaining water would be recycled, he said.The net result is a 10-time higher yield from one unit area, which justifies the capital investment. Though this type of farming already exists in developed countries, we could not adopt them in our agricultural system directly because of the variation in climatic conditions. It has taken almost two years for making the unit functional, he said.He said the trial and error identification and mitigation of the same over the past two years in a big commercial set-up has made the plan stronger. He also thanked the staff of the Agri Business Development Cell of the TNAU for their support in rendering technological and funding assistance in setting up the system at `55 lakh.R Murugesan, Director of Agri Business Development of TNAU, said, We have been giving promotional support to them. Recently, we organised a conference with 35 business heads."

She says, I was very passionate about cooking when I was a kid. I saw lot of bonding happening in the kitchen. That excited me a lot. We were in a joint family. I often found myself once back from school, with the ladies, in the kitchen. It started all there and kept growing more and more in me as a passion.Shazia Khan, first runner up ofMasterChef IndiaBut she never dreamt even in her wildest dreams that she would ever participate in MasterChef and become a chef. It was meant to happen, she says adding, The journey since has been beautiful and very humbling. Theres lot of learning. When you work is your passion, you enjoy it even more. So, I am enjoying my work. I love doing workshops and sharing my knowledge. I also travel quite a bit.A Modern Indian cook, Shazia calls every ingredient unique. Every ingredient is unique in its way. It has something to do with the flavours and textures. As a chef, it is a learning to play with new ingredients and create something new. If there is an ingredient, I find tough to work with, I work more on it and figure out recipes. For example, bitter gourd. Everybody feels it is tough to work with.But as you try, it is actually fun to work to with it.She has made a couple of dishes with bitter gourd, but what is interesting is that bitter gourd can be combined with meat like mutton keema. She says people are usually scared to use it thinking that it will be bitter in taste. But there is a technique. She adds, I learned the technique from my grandmother. You need to soak it in tamarind pulp to remove the whole bitterness and increase the sour agent, that you may find due to tomato or tamarind pulp from the recipe.She created a recipe called stuffed karelas after several trials and errors. She explains, They are small stuffed karela cups. They are stuffed with keema, a morocco style mutton mince. Lot of people loved it. The karela adds whole crunch to the dish. The flavours and spices of morocco cuisine make it taste completely different. It doesnt taste like the usual karelas.The chef Shazia Khan was recently in the city for a cookery workshop at Phoenix Marketcity."

Even as a kid, I was good with home-made recipes and I owe a lot to my mother for that!As a young chef, I also had the opportunity to work in West Asia for a while, and I collaborated with the personal chef of the Prince of Wales during my time in Europe.I also worked with Michelin star chef Vineet Bhatia at the only authentic Indian restaurant in mainland Europe. But I realised that I really wanted to explore modern Indian food and experiment with Indian flavours than cater to western cuisine. Especially, I want Indian food to be recognised globally through the Michelin star reputation, and am attempting that through my own venture, Chefman.Martin LouisI am well-versed in European, Meditteranean, modern Indian cuisine, and homemade recipes. I especially crave for authentic tastes in my food. Precisely for this reason, I always work with my own spices and grind my own powders rather than going for packaged ones  be it piri piri spices, sambar powder or Mexican flavours.I dont use adulterated mixes because working with fresh spices induces the flavours easily. Id rather use fresh tomatoes in cooking than go for processed tomato puree, and make homemade pasta in at least one of my dishes.This is because I strongly believe that authenticity is key to keeping cooking natural.I dont believe fusion food is the right way to put it  in fact a lot of our ingredients with western cooking are very similar. It is just that the cultures and climatic conditions have affected the cooking styles. So yes, while I do attempt to experiment I still keep the authentic taste of the food intact.For example, I have taken an Italian dish called Arancini (stuffed rice balls coated with bread crumbs and fried) and used our very own sambar rice or pongal to make the dish! What Ive done is taken the Italian concept and added Indian flavours to it.As for presentation and plating, making it look presentable is not as important as putting the right ingredients to garnish. You should choose elements that complement the taste of the dish and not just for decorating or to make it look vibrant. Aspiring chefs should also take care to get their basics right as well as learn portion control and hygiene control. After that, you can move on to more detailed things like molecular gastronomy!"

As the government will not be in a position to announce a waiver at least for a few months, it has swung into action to ensure the indebted farmers are not hassled in getting a loan for seeds, fertilisers and pesticides essential for sowing, which will begin in first week of June, immediately after monsoon sets in. The government is thinking of purchasing seeds and fertilisers and distribute them with the help of NGOs and social organisations.The Opposition has been batting for a loan waiver for farmers similar to the one given in Uttar Pradesh. The Congress, NCP and four smaller parties boycotted proceedings of the Assemblys budget session for three weeks to push the demand. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had declared that his government, too, was in favour of the waiver, but at an appropriate time. He said his government was studying the UP model of a waiver. He also said that rather than a waiver, the thrust would be on sustainable development of agriculture.To reduce expenditure on farm labourers, the government is mulling funding them from the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS). We have not been able to fully utilise the central funds allocated under NREGS, but on the other hand, the cost of farm labourers is unbearable for farmers. By funding farm labour, we can extend a great relief to the farmers helping them to reduce cost of production. Similarly, on other fronts, too, we are tapping the possibilities to extend the benefits to the farmers, said an official from the agriculture department.The cooperation department is planning to restructure the loans given to the farmers to enable them to get fresh loans for the kharip season. The government is also considering health, education and housing schemes in the package so that the socio-economic burden is reduced.It will be a package of various schemes by 3 to 4 departments to ensure farmers are heavily subsidised to bring farming to the level of affordability. Right from testing of the soil health, sufficient supply of water, power supply at subsidised rates to effective marketing of the agriculture products, we are planning to do everything that will minimise the gap between the production cost and the rate in the market, Subhash Deshmukh, cooperation minister, told HT.The government is also tapping the idea of bring about 22 crops in the list of produce with minimum support price. It will bear the cost of difference between the market price and the MSP, particularly for crops such as tomato, onion and grapes, whose rates have fallen this year. Our aim is to bring cost of production to zero for about 1.07 lakh farmers who hold less than 5 acres of land. Instead of giving them money, the government will purchase the things required to cultivate and distribute with the help various organisations working in the sector, the officer said.According to rough estimates, the schemes will cost around Rs10,000 crore if implemented. But the estimates are primary, and depends on the feasibility of the all schemes being tapped. The schemes could be implemented if the government wins over the demand of the loan waiver, which is expected to cost Rs30,500 crore. But it succumbed to pressure for the waiver. It will have to cut short the schemes, another official from the cooperation department said.Read: Sangharsh Yatra: Waive loan before farmers lose patience, say Maharashtra opposition leadersMaharashtra Opposition intensifies attacks on govt, kicks off second Sangharsh Yatra for farm loan waiver"

Chief minister Raghubar Das will inaugurate the processing plant, which will process vegetables including green peas, jackfruit, beans, cauliflower, ginger and litchi.Mother Dairy, a subsidiary of National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), markets its vegetable and fruit products under the brand name of Safal, which has been exporting processed food products to 38 countries.The trial run for pea and jackfruit processing, which was started in February this year, has been successful and the plant is ready for commercial production.The plant of second phase, which will extend the processing of tomato, mango, guava, amla and other fruits, is expected to begin functioning from November this year, said officials on Monday.This will be the eastern regions first high-tech integrated automated processing plants along with individual quick freezing and aseptic pulping line facility, said Dilip Rath, chairman of NDDB.Das had laid the foundation stone of Mother Dairys third biggest vegetable and fruit processing plant in February last year.Jharkhand is a vegetable surplus state, producing 38 lakh metric ton vegetables annually against the requirement of 30 lakh metric tonne. The state supplies around one million tonne vegetables to other states, mainly Bihar, Odisha and West Bengal .Due to shortage of buyers, farmers have to dump their surplus produce every year. This year, thousands of farmers dumped tomato and peas at their farm fields, as tomato price dropped to 50 paise kg, while green peas was sold at Rs 2 per kg in wholesale market.Farmers income will grow with operations of the plant, as raw material would be purchased from farmers at fair price. The project will help 50,000 farmers of the state. We have set a target to add value to 75,000 metric ton of raw vegetable and fruit produce, including 50,000 metric ton of vegetables and 25,000 metric ton of fruits, Rath said.The processing plants at Nagri are at par with NDDBs Delhi plants.

(Bhola Prasad)Vaarta, an annual agriculture meet that kicked off at Ganesh Puja Maidan in Kadma today, raised a toast to all those farmers who have reaped success by applying smart techniques on their land.The three-day event, featuring farmers from Kolhan region and scientists from across research institutes of the country, aims to promote better cultivation of crops in East Singhbhum, West Singhbhum and Seraikela-Kharsawan. It was inaugurated by Sunil Bhaskaran, vice-president (corporate services), Tata Steel, along with R. Ravi Prasad, president, Tata Workers' Union.Around 600 farmers are taking part in the meet, which will also witness an exhibition and sale of farming equipment, agricultural produce, seeds, compost and a large variety of techniques used for better farming.On the first say, success stories like that of Vishwanath Tudu (41) were aplenty.The daily wage labourer, who till three years ago found it hard to feed his family, has a flourishing farming business now. He has wisely used his 4.8 acres of barren land at Benagadia in Ghurabandha block of East Singhbhum, thanks to Tata Steel Rural Development Society (TSRDS) that helped him dug up a pond.""The main hurdle that I faced was water scarcity. The unproductive land now yields creepers, vegetables, tomatoes and other crops. A quintal of fish was released in the pond,"" said Tudu.Another farmer, Ranjit Kumar Mahto (50) from Ghurabandha block, added: ""TSRDS helped me too. We know the crop will not fail because we have started implementing more scientific techniques and platforms like Vaarta help us learn new trends.""Over the next two days, farmers, along with scientists, will deliberate on a number of topics like climate-resilient agriculture, vegetable marketing, integrated farming, lac cultivation, pisciculture and much more.The scientists and experts have come from International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, Hyderabad; Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture, Hyderabad; Central Horticultural Experiment Station, Bhubaneswar; Central Rainfed Upland Rice Research Station; and Birsa Agricultural University."

The programme started in December last year and germination has begun in the area, the state horticulture department said. It added that the crop will be ready by February.Usually, this area gets vegetables around April, but by using this technology we can get vegetables by February. This will also meet the demand (for vegetables), said Deen Mohammad Khan, district horticulture officer, Gurgaon.The horticulture department said it has plans to extend the programme to crops affected by a bad monsoon too. It could stabilise the prices that go up every year around the time due to disrupted supply.Under this method, tunnels are dug within five to six feet of each other and soil preparation is done before sowing, which started in December.We have sowed cucumber, melons, watermelons, bitter gourds, squashes and snake gourds that are easy to grow in these tunnels. The low tunnels get better sunlight, ventilation and get water through drip irrigation. The tunnels are suitable for growing tomatoes, cucumbers and melons, said Khan.In one acre, a farmer can earn Rs2.5 to Rs3 lakh per harvest and the setup can be used for three years without tilling the land, he added.The mulching procedure involves simple techniques to create the tunnels. Bamboo sticks are tied to plastic sheets in a semi-circular structure to support the growing vegetable. Another plastic sheet is then placed on the structure to trap sunlight inside and create an optimal temperature for the crop to grow. The covered layer also reduces water loss and eliminates growth of weeds.At present, 160 farmers are with us in this programme. Our target is to increase this number by five times to serve the entire population of Gurgaon, said Khan."

Farmers of Bhandra, Kero, Kuru and Senha blocks of Lohardaga district and in Ranchi and other parts of the country Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradeshhave been dumping their tomatoes, onions and French beans.Huge dumps of vegetables were seen along Ranchi-Tata highway (NH-33) near Bhuinyadih vegetable market in Ranchis Tamar block after having been forced to sell their produce at throwaway prices because of bumper crop and cash crunch.The National Institution for Transforming India (Niti) Aayog in a recent paper admitted to the slump in vegetable prices, but attributed it to the bumper crop and not demonetisation of Rs 500/1000 notes.We are in catch-22 situation. Traders are not buying our produce. We neither able to sell the vegetable nor to take it at home, Jaipal Singh Munda, a tomato farmer, said.Jagdish Mahato, a trader at Bhuinyadih wholesale market, said, Tomatoes and French beans are being sold at Rs 1-2 a kg in the market while cauliflower is Rs 5 a piece for last few days.However, the price of tomato is Rs 6-10 a kg, French beans and cauliflower Rs 10 in vegetable markets in Ranchi city.With good monsoon this year, farmers have produced bumper crops in the country.Traders purchasing power has declined after demonetisation. They have restricted their orders. West Bengal traders are not coming to buy vegetables from Jharkhand at this time, said Nakul Mahato, a vegetable grower from Ranchis Pithoria area, who also sells vegetables to West Bengal.State horticulture director Rajiv Kumar said Jharkhand recorded bumper crops this year. So, it is natural the demand will fall. We are trying to increase the demand through advertising significance of tomato on health.He said residents would be requested to buy tomato and store them as ketchup.Next year onwards, vegetable route will also be defined where farmers will be requested to produce different vegetables so that farmers do not see such situation, he said.Jharkhand is a known for surplus vegetable production. According to Jharkhand state horticulture mission (JSHM), the state produces around 38 lakh metric tonne vegetables annually against a requirement of 30 lakh metric tonne.

In its first two years, the government cleared more economic reforms  including deregulating diesel prices, cutting cooking gas subsidy and making it easier for companies to exit business  than in the last five years of the previous government. Millions more have been brought into the countrys banking system and the government has pushed digitisation.In the latest budget, the government also announced incentives to labour-intensive sectors such as clothing and leather along with spending more on projects like roads, railways, low-cost housing and irrigation.I will give the Prime Minister two out of 10. Even 2 seems two much. I feel like giving only one. Modis foreign policy is good . The one point is just for that.But Modis critics say much of this is old wine in a new bottle, minor cosmetic tweaks that havent put India on the path of a paradigm shift the prime minister had promised.Economic growth hasnt created enough jobs because of lack of investment, income inequality has grown, farm distress has soared and the cash ban has only worsened the economic outlook in the immediate term. Credit to industry remains flat and, despite higher farm credit target, disbursement levels have dipped as banks seek to avoid bad loans.Even for some Modi fans like Rambir Rathi, a sugarcane farmer in Uttar Pradeshs Baghpat, the dream of achhe din is coming unstruck.I voted for Modi. Farmers like us were promised Rs 500 for a quintal of sugarcane instead of the Rs 315 we were receiving then. I believed in him, says the father of two.They told us our dues would be paid by the sugar mill owners but look what has happened. The rate is the same. Our dues remain unpaid.Asked to rate Modis governance of more than two years, Rathi gives the prime minister two on 10.Do bhi jyada hai. Mann toh nahin karta hai ek bhi dene ko (Even two is too much. I dont feel like giving him even one), he says, adding Modi had only done well on dealing with Pakistan.But farms in distressWith mounting debt, poverty, increasing health cost and other ballooning farming-related expenses, farm incomes dropped 50%-70% over the past years. And just farmers hoped to claw back from two years of back-to-back drought, the government ordered a disruptive currency ban that squeezed the largely cash-only agriculture sector.Farm prices crashed as farmers dumped tomatoes and potatoes onto the streets, fed unharvested crop to cattle and farm hands sat idle. A farm loan write-off for two months after demonetisation hardly helped, some economists say.Februarys budget raised the farm credit target to by 11.1% to Rs 10-lakh crore in 2017-18 but, in reality, bank lending to farmers has dropped and the distribution of credit has focussed on a handful of relatively better-off states.Expenditure on agriculture is seen rising marginally to Rs 2.06-lakh crore in 2017/18, but this in real terms might signal a decline.Fewer jobsSigns of distress are clear in cities as well. Sharp rises in education and healthcare costs in the last two years have hit Indias burgeoning middle class hard, denting Modis popularity among the relatively well-off.Today, India stands before a unique moment in history: It could choose to squander its immense potential with its antiquated socio-political system, corruption and flighty business rules or build on its cultural heritage, democratic values and a young demography to transform the lives of its 1.25 billion citizens.To begin with, two decades on, nothing less than a $10 trillion economy will secure Indias future, says a recent study by Pricewaterhouse Coopers( PwC). It will have to create jobs on a scale that can absorb 10-12 million people who join the workforce every year, including members of the emerging middle class  a billion strong by 2034.Read | Achhe din will come only after 2019, Cong working on it: Rahul GandhiBut only 135,000 jobs were created in 2015 -- the lowest total in seven years and 67% lower than the number created in the last year of the previous government. In one quarter of 2016-17, for which official data is available, only 77,000 jobs were created  and of these 50,000 were government jobs.The gloom is affecting the youth.Chartered accountant Omprakash Sethia in Bhopal.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley this month said the government will spend a record amount on rural areas and farming to help double farmers income by 2022.But Singh is unimpressed.Narendra Modi stressed on jobs during his speeches in general election.

Either sell at throwaway prices or dump the crop.Fresh produce like vegetables and fruits are sold in cash, he said, adding that the trade remains affected even two-and-a-half-months after the government scrapped higher-value currency notes on November 8.Cheques are not used. And farmers are not entering into the new economic system (going cashless) that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has proposed. The result is a dip in prices, added Panwar, also member of the Planning Commission of Uttar Pradesh.According to Jakhar, who is also Editor of agriculture magazines Farmers Forum and Krishak Samachar, If the cost of harvesting the crop is as much as sowing, then the farmer will not harvest. If a farmer takes his produce to the market, and it is not sold, or the price is very low, he may dump the produce.Demonetisation has also severely impacted the future of cooperative banks, says Jakhar, a farmer from Punjab, adding that farmers are hoping that Prime Minister Modi will compensate the loss in some way in the Union Budget on February 1.Read| Demonetisation: Rs 22,600 crore loss for real estate sectorIn the face of criticism that the move to scrap Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes had hit the Rabi sowing season, the government has maintained that, in fact, Rabi sowing (winter crop) acreage had gone up this year.While Panwar noted that the Rabi sowing acreage figures is data collated by the government, Jakhar does not think that sowing acreage was impacted due to demonetisation, but he pointed out that the comparison is with a drought year. He added that Rabi sowing costs have gone up and the quality gone down.What the government is telling us indirectly through this (higher Rabi sowing figure) is that money is not necessary for sowing, Panwal said.Otherwise how could a BJP MP say that the note ban helped farmers to correct their budget, or suggest they were spending money on alcohol, etc., he said, referring to BJP MP and Kisan Morcha President Virendra Singh who said earlier this month that the biggest benefit of demonetisation was that it helped farmers avoid fizul kharchi (wasteful expenditure).This means the farmer can fare better without money, he added, with a touch of sarcasm.For sowing, farmers purchase seeds, and when they do not have cash, they use seeds saved at home. No good variety of seeds was used this year, or fertiliser. The sale of certified seeds and fertilisers was lower due to the note ban, said Panwar.Farmers use inferior or old seeds and less inputs... thus quality is hit, he says.Demonetisation has not only hit agriculture, but also Indias vast informal sector -- artisans, semi-skilled workers, house construction workers, etc. -- that accounts for around 45 per cent of the GDP and nearly 80 per cent of employment, says Panwar.The vast informal sector was not paying tax, it is true. But they were providing employment, and wages, and these units in the informal sector have closed down due to the cash limit, he says.Now the stand of the government is that no one should operate without paying tax. The main purpose of this exercise (demonetisation) is that. And so, they have shut down their units, and those who were earning wages are now sitting idle.While the cash situation has eased, the job scenario continues to remain bleak, says Panwar, adding that the note ban effect will be felt for quite some time.Read| Baba Ramdev supports Modi for surgical strike and demonetisation"

Here, she creates Arabic-language recipe videos, cooking food ranging from Middle Eastern specialties to all-around favourites like brownies and ice cream.Adi is the founder and CEO of Basmaty World , an Arabic-language cooking channel on YouTube that she is transforming into a network that brings cooks from across the region under one brand. Basmaty generates around 1 million views per month on YouTube and has more than 300,000 followers on Facebook.She is part of a growing group of entrepreneurs who have chosen Dubai as a ground for growing their business. Two of the regions biggest success stories are based in Dubai. Valued at some $1 billion, ride-hailing app Careem and Souq.com, which was acquired by Amazon last month, have given the local entrepreneurship scene a boost.Adi started her business in 2011 in her hometown of Damascus, Syria, working with a small team of videographers and Syrian chefs, known in the Middle East for producing some of the most complex and delicious Mediterranean dishes.As I was searching for recipes in Arabic, I saw that there was a gap, there was not much out there, so the idea emerged this way, she said. I decided why dont I do a website that provides reliable and high-quality recipes in Arabic to serve the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region.Soon after the war erupted in Syria that same year, Adi left Damascus. To keep her business running, she quickly taught herself how to shoot and edit videos featuring herself as a passionate cook.For Adi, cooking means potentially big business with lucrative deals. In 2014, Japans recipe portal Cookpad acquired Lebanese cooking site Shahiya for a reported $13.5 million.Adis videos take hard work behind the scenes, including collaborating with brands for recipe creation and product placement.She spends hours shooting video and photos of her recipe creations, before editing and posting the mouth-watering final results for her more than 180,000 subscribers on YouTube.In this Tuesday, April 4, 2017, photo, Alia Adi, founder of YouTube cooking channel Basmaty World, works at her studio in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. (AP Photo)On this particular shoot, Adi whips up a popular Levantine dip called lebnah, made fresh from yoghurt she strained overnight. She chops pistachios and apricots before drizzling honey on one lebnah dish. On another, she adds chopped olives, sun-dried tomatoes drenched in olive oil, and more olive oil for good measure.Adi says she has saved thousands of dollars in licensing fees and other government-related costs for her business thanks to help from In5, a government-backed incubator that assists entrepreneurs. In5 also offers Dubai-based entrepreneurs access to work space, training and mentorship programs, networking events and investors.I think one of the major challenges for young entrepreneurs here is related to funding... because ideas, there are a lot of ideas. Theres a lot of creativity, she said.Adi initially relocated to London after leaving Syria, but despite it being easier and cheaper to establish her business there, she settled on Dubai to be closer to her customers and clients.Dubai for me was the best location to do that. Its the country that provides most value for me, as a startup, she said. Leaving Syria, I was looking for somewhere stable where I could continue and grow my business so Dubai was definitely the number one option."

58ff1c877be9e041361628f2,"Thanks to note ban, farm sector may not see 'acche din'",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/594489/thanks-note-ban-farm-sector.html,2017-02-02,,Deccan Herald,"Sagar Kulkarni, Feb 3, 2017, DHNS 8:48 ISTDateline: New DelhiDays after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced scrapping of high value currency notes, Agriculture Ministry officials were eagerly awaiting the details about sowing for rabi crops across the country. The government was facing all round criticism for having announced the note ban at a time when the agriculture sector was witnessing an upswing on the back of a better monsoon after two consecutive drought years.The sudden withdrawal of legal tender of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes had left the farmers devoid of any cash to buy seeds or fertilisers. But as the figures trickled in, there was a sense of cheer as the sowing operations appeared unaffected.Up to November 11, rabi sowing was completed on 14.6 million hectare area  5.7% lower than normal crop coverage and the gap declined steadily. During the week ending January 20, 2017 sown area under rabi crops was 628.34 lakh hectares, which was 6.07% more than last year's acreage of 592.36 lakh hectares.Agriculture Minister Radhamohan Singh has been issuing statements on how demonetisation had not affected rabi sowing to counter the campaign by opposition leaders on note-ban leading to agrarian distress.Experts have been sceptical about the government's gung-ho approach vis-a-vis the rabi sowing numbers, particularly the comparison with the previous year's acreage which was low because of severe drought. Though the government speaks glowingly about demonetisation not affecting farm activity, the numbers tell a different story. According to the data released by the Agriculture Ministry, rabi sowing in 2013-14 had touched 670 lakh hectares and leading to a bumper harvest of 263 million tonnes.Economist Pronab Sen was categorical. Rabi sowing looks big on the small base of last year, he said. Sen, India's first chief statistician, also said the government could have pushed for implementation of demonetisation in January this year as the seven-week gap would have helped farmers make purchases of seeds and fertilisers for sowing of the winter crop.According to Sen, delaying note ban by a few weeks would have helped farmers sell their kharif crop, prices of which had already fallen drastically on account of good harvest. The wholesale markets, which usually deal in cash, had a tough time lifting the farm produce and the maximum impact was felt by those dealing in fruits and vegetables.Farmers in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh dumped their potato crop on the roads in Ambala and Lucknow, respectively, as they had no cash to pay for transportation of the farm produce to wholesale markets. In Gujarat's Surat, farmers threw vegetables and milk on the streets as they had no access to cash after the government kept out the district central cooperative banks out of the demonetisation process.Prices of fruits and vegetables dropped in wholesale markets post-demonetisation as did the market arrivals. Prices of banana, apple, tomato, cabbage were lower in the range of 4% to 9% in November when compared with the rates in October, making it clear that farmers were affected to some extent.Government analysts say that the prices of tomatoes crashed in December because of glut in the market due to bumper crop. But they admit that it would be difficult to ascertain how much fall was because of the glut and how much due to disruption due to demonetisation.Cash crunch in rural areas had turned acute as the cooperative banks as well as primary cooperative credit societies too were kept out of cash exchange affecting purchase of quality seeds and fertilisers by farmers.There were reports about slowdown in farm activity such as timely spraying of pesticides or application of fertiliser for want of labour. Many farmers were unable to make cash payments to farm labourers who were forced to return to their home towns. Cotton trade nosedived as mills were unable to make cash payments to farmers who supply bales.Quiet acceptanceThere is quiet acceptance of this fact within the government circles as productivity may take a hit this year. Also, farmers have bought far less amount of fertilisers this rabi season when compared with the previous two drought years. One set of estimates peg the sale of fertilisers to be nearly 7.5% lower than the previous year.This means that despite high acreage achieved during the sowing phase may not reflect in the farm output this rabi season. According to a study by Ramesh Chand, Member, Niti Aayog, a 1% increase/decrease in fertiliser use result in 0.1% increase/decrease in agriculture GDP and about 0.14% increase/decrease in crop output.If the current trend in the shortfall in fertiliser consumption continued till the end of the rabi season, it could lead to a more than 1% decline in production. As a result, the rate of growth in farmers income is also expected to dip due to the drop, though Chand still pegs it at 5.8% in real terms for 2016-17.Indias farm sector was looking set for some good times after two consecutive drought years that had slowed down growth and even witnessed a contraction of 0.2% in 2014-15. The normal monsoon had cheered the farmers who had reaped a better kharif harvest and were keen to follow up with even better returns in the winter crop cycle.Ratings agencies had forecast 4% growth for 2016-17 over the previous year which was certainly brighter given the meagre growth in the past couple of years. The sector had barely witnessed growth since 2011. In 2012-13, the farm sector grew by 1.5%, followed by 4.2% in 2013-14, -0.2% in 2014-15 and 1.2% in 2015-16. At a time when things were looking up, the demonetisation decision has pushed the long desired achhe din for agriculture in the realm of uncertainty."

Their family -- six boys and a girl -- had been eating little for the last three months as money ran out and supplies became harder to get a hold of in the half of the northern Iraqi city that is still under the rule of the Islamic State group.Iraqi forces, after capturing the east in January, have been gearing up for a final assault on the west that officials say could come at any time. In past weeks, people have been slipping out of the western sector, saying a mix of poverty and low food stocks meant that getting food had become a serious problem.People were eating whatever they had, water with bread, or water with tomato paste, said Umm Mohammed. Her kids sometimes went to bed without even that. She and her family made it to eastern Mosul, then to a camp for displaced people outside the city.She spoke on condition she be identified by her traditional honorific because she feared for the safety of relatives still in western Mosul.The United Nations estimates that up to 750,000 civilians may be left in the western half of the city. Aid agencies have no access and all the commercial arteries have been blocked. Since the beginning of the year, around 140 families -- some 600 people -- have made it out of the west to the camps of displaced, according to the UN.The militants have been trying to prevent residents from leaving.Iraqis from Mosul queue for permission to pass through a checkpoint in Bartella. Hundreds of people arrive at the checkpoint every day either fleeing the violence in their home city or to visit their relatives elsewhere in Iraq. (AP)Dafr Mohammed, a 24-year-old farmer from Baddoush, a town on the northern outskirts of the city, said he arranged a boat to cross the Tigris river to the eastern side but was caught by the militants. He was only able to get out because he convinced them his wife was sick and needed a doctor -- and because he left other relatives back in the west, which they took as a guarantee.Most nights we went to bed hungry, including the two kids, said Mohammed.He said the problem wasnt so much the lack of food but that people had no more money to pay for it. Daesh took all the wheat and barley we harvested this year without payment so we didnt have any money, he said, using the Arabic acronym for IS.He survived by doing odd jobs and sometimes getting some money from an uncle who was still receiving his pension. By January, they run out of heating fuel and wood, and started burning their clothes to keep the children warm, he said.Prices in western Mosul have skyrocketed, especially after the road to Syria was blocked late last year, because no more food was coming in, those who escaped said. A 50 kg sack of rice rose to 120,000 dinars ($95), from 19,000 ($15). A sack of flour, once 1,000 dinars ($.80), is now 7,000 ($6).The UNs humanitarian arm said earlier this month that powdered milk for babies had become almost completely unavailable and that a lack of drinking water was also a problem.Abdul-Rahman Aouf Aziz, a 24-year-old who fled in January, said he had got out because he couldnt handle it anymore and was prepared to risk his life in the escape.There was no life left there. It had become very hard, he said."

The initiative is aimed at growing soil-less vegetables and getting them supplied to the residential societies across the city.The focus is on growing vegetables minus the harmful effects of pesticides. The project was launched in January 2016.This is the future of farming and vegetable cultivation. Instead of soil, coconut fibre is used to fill the pots and liquid nutrients are provided in a controlled environment, Din Mohammad Khan, district horticulture officer, said.Vinay Jain, an active participant in this futuristic agricultural project, said, To grow soil-less vegetables, we have to provide the plants with adequate sunlight, ensure proper environs and temperature for them to grow and add the nutrients required.Those engaged in this effort are trying to grow vegetables and fruits such as cucumber, tomato, capsicum, strawberry, lettuce and other leafy varietiesFarming materialThe process involves coconut fibre, filtered water, liquid nutrition, pebbles and saplings . Once soil-less farming picks up and finds takers among residents, people would also be encouraged to use to hydroponic system to enable terrace gardening or farming.Growing period and project costNon-fruit bearing vegetables takes less than 15 days to grow, while the ones that bear fruit take about a month to grow. While it costs 60 lakh to grow soil-less vegetables over a one-acre area, the cost goes down if they are grown in a lesser space.BenefitsThe hydroponic process of growing soil-less vegetables ensures that they are available all around the year. Those involved in the project said the plants grow 50% faster than they would on soil and quantitatively too, the produce is a lot more. Vertical structures are being used for cultivation.At present, tomatoes, basil and parsley are being grown on a one-acre plot.A huge advantage of soil-less farming is that it doesnt allow nematodes (roundworm or threadworm) to affect food crops or vegetables. The nematodes that inhabit the soil not only damage the stems, but also impairs the foliage and flowers. The vegetables damaged by these worms could be harmful for health, Khan said.In this process, all vegetables are grown in a uniform space and the coconut fibre does not retain excessive water. We do not require fertilisers and pesticides as the vegetables are grown in a controlled environment. We use a polythene sheet to shield the vegetables from ultraviolet rays. The plants grow in a safe and healthy environment and produce vegetables and fruits free of chemicals, Dhruv Kumar, a farmer engaged in thisproject, said.This mode of farming could soon be adopted in condominiums and high-rises as it would enable residents to grow vegetables free from the harmful effects of chemicals. At present, we are analysing the quality of the produce and the feasibility of this mode of farming. In a city like Gurgaon, which gets less rainfall, the hydroponic system of growing vegetables could find a lot of takers, Khan said.The demand for safer and healthier food has prompted the use of new technologies and scientific research to grow fruits and vegetables without chemicals."

Initiatives to enhance irrigation network by renovating major reservoir projects, however, will increase yields in a year or two.Agricultural experts of the department, however, claimed that production of major cereals and vegetables this year would be very high as compared to past years.Notwithstanding official claims, the survey report fails to project a cosy picture for the farm sector. Besides dip in production of major fruits like mango, guava, litchi and banana, productivity of major crops like wheat, rice and pulse also witnessed downtrend in 2015-16 as compared to 2013-14.Although production of potato witnessed marginal improvement (63.45 lakh tonne in 2015-16 against 60.50 lakh tonne in 2013-14), onion and tomato went down to 12.47 lakh tonne from 13.04 lakh tonne and 10.01 lakh tonne from 10.61 lakh ton in the same corresponding year.Net sown area for sugarcane also came down to 3.46% of net cultivable area in 2015-16 as against 3.66% recorded in 2013-14.

So, notebandias demonetisation is called colloquiallycouldnt have come at a worse time. With money sucked out of the market, there was a tomato glut, and prices crashed by 80%.A 15-kg crate of tomatoes traded this year between Rs 30 and Rs 50 (instead of Rs 700 at its peak), said Kumar. I had no reason to spend on transportation and bring it to the market or wait for the price to pick up. So, I uprooted all my tomato plants in late November to minimise the loss. This is the worst we have seen in my experience.Kolar is the biggest vegetable-growing region in Karnataka, and houses Asias second-largest tomato market. In November, the ruling price of tomatoes in the Kolar market was Rs 3-5 per kg, or 85% lesser than the same time in 2015.Kumars case is echoed across India. The price of tomatoes crashed to 25 paise/kg, The New Indian Express reported on December 10, 2016, which prompted farmers in a Chhattisgarh district to dump nearly 100 tractor-trolleys, or about 45,000 kg, of tomatoes, on a national highway.Similar incidents by frustrated farmers were reported in Nashik, Hyderabad and other key vegetable-growing regions.Worst hit: Southern tomato farmers, western onion farmersTomato farmers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu were the worst hit since prices fell by 60-85% while onion farmers were the worst hit in Maharashtra and Gujarat, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of vegetable prices in seven Indian citiesAhmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbaibetween November 2015 and November 2016.Source: National Horticulture Board; Negative values indicate rise in pricesThe price of potatoes, which have a shelf life of up to 2-3 months, was stable in places such as Delhi and Chennai, while it rose between 17% and 25% in Bengaluru and Mumbai. The price of potatoes per quintal was Rs 1,086 in November 2015, increasing 27% to Rs 1,376 in November 2016.The price of peas dropped between 15% and 20%, with arrivals increasing in six cities, except Mumbai.The crash in prices was also due to oversupply, the data show. While the prices of tomatoes (hybrid variety) fell by 55-85%, the supply was double and even triple the previous year in parts of India, such as Ahmedabad, Kolkata and Hyderabad, according to data from the National Horticulture Board.In Chennai, for instance, the maximum price a farmer could get per quintal of tomatoes in November 2016 was Rs 760, compared to Rs 4,900 in November 2015, a drop of 85%. The supply to the city was 2,910 metric tonne, an increase of 40% from 2015.In Hyderabad, prices dropped 60% but supply increased 337% in November.Onions were traded anywhere between Rs 650 and Rs 1,500 per quintal in November 2016, compared to Rs 3,027 to Rs 5,600 in 2015.At the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Nashik, Maharashtra, Indias largest wholesale onion market, onions were sold at between Rs 5 and Rs 7 a kilogram.In the seven cities we analysed data for, supply was 196,400 metric tonne in November 2016, against 186,175 metric tonne in November 2015.The situation worsened in December, as prices fell by another 20-50%, and peas traded at a 10-year low in the Delhi market, according to officials from the horticulture department.Enough rains ensured a good harvest but low pricesThe monsoon rains would subside during September to November, and it would result in lesser yield, indicating lesser supply and higher prices, Bellur Krishna, managing director of the state-owned Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society, told IndiaSpend. This year, the rainfall was good in the vegetable-growing regions of Karnataka.This led to good harvest but the prices are also down due to the cash crisis triggered by demonetisation, he said.Kolar, Belagavi, Haveri and Chitradurga, the top vegetable-growing regions in Karnataka, received normal rainfall during the south-west monsoon in 2016.Karnataka declared a drought in 22 districts and some additional talukas in October 2016; the state received Rs 1,782 crore from the central government, IndiaSpend reported on January 10, 2016.The impact of demonetisation could only be to the extent of 20% of the price fall, said Krishna.Demonetisation is expected to hurt agriculture and informal-sector workers, IndiaSpend had reported on November 15, 2016.Around 9.4 million hectares, or 10% of Indias cropped area, is under vegetable cultivation, of which 50% is given to potato, onion and tomato, according to Horticulture Board data.Most of the transactions in fruits and vegetables are in cash, Brajendra Singh, director, National Horticulture Board, told IndiaSpend. So, demonetisation has definitely had some bearing. Arrivals had increased; so, the downturn was obvious.Tomato cultivation is usually routed through market clusters (around cities) and is profitable, Singh said.This time, it was available from local sources, said Singh. The price of tomatoes had gone up to Rs 50 a kg over the last two years. This year, the climate was favourable and resulted in bumper crops. Suddenly, the markets were depressed due to oversupply and because there was no cash.Singh predicted the situation would be normal over the next quarter, and crops would fetch a good price for farmers by the summer of 2017."

A Mumbai Start-Up Will Now Keep Them Fresh for over a Month,http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rotten-tomatoes-a-mumbai-start-up-will-now-keep-them-fresh-for-over-a-month/story-hf2ZtZW57cYPXgkNmuZBhL.html,2017-01-11,,Hindustan Times,"Ever had to throw out the last few squishy tomatoes in your veggie crisper because they went bad too soon? Well, a Mumbai start-up may have just hit upon something to save those rotten tomatoes.Science for Society (S4S), a start-up by Matunga-based Institute of Chemical Technology (ICT), has developed a novel packaging technology  ProVegie  that will increase the shelf life of tomatoes by a month.Tomatoes, which are the largest growing commodity globally, including India, usually have a life of five to seven days. The countrys daily consumption of tomatoes is 40,000 tonnes, and post-harvest losses are anywhere between 20% and 40% every year due to poor handling, storage and transportation methods.Developed countries store tomatoes in cold storage that extends their shelf life to 20 days, says Vaibhav Tidke, chief executive officer of S4S. This storage method, however, wont work for Indian farmers since its expensive, and there is no constant electricity supply in villages.A survey of 50 vendors in the city found that unlike onions and potatoes, grocers dont store tomatoes since transportation over large distances damages them, leading to wastage. We want this to change. We want this category of vegetable to move to that of onions and potatoes, so a grocer can also stock them, said Tidke.For the last six months, the S4S team is building a mobile-operated machine that can treat and pack 10,000kg tomatoes per day. It will first treat tomatoes and then package them.ProVegie combines fundamental knowledge of how tomatoes respire and allows this respiration through specially designed packaging to create a self-stable product that will ease storage, transport and logistics, said professor Bhaskar Thorat, who heads the chemical engineering department at ICT, and served as an advisor to S4S.This new packing technology will retain the key nutrients, taste and aroma of tomatoes to serve consumer demands. ProVegie, which will be ready by May this year, is likely to be installed in Nashik, Pune or Aurangabad.According to the model developed by S4S, farmers will sell tomatoes to the start-up and can then take back the processed tomatoes, which can be stored for almost a month and sold in the market. At present, the team is creating a value chain, tying up with grocers, retailers, and companies manufacturing tomato sauces.The S4S team has decided against applying for a patent, instead opting for trade secret intellectual property route. ProVegie is designed to be remotely operated from any place with a mobile phone that will be configured with the SIM card in the machine. This is to ensure that the machine is not opened, said Tidke. So, the operators job will only be to load the tomatoes and see the packaged product."

Her home, however, is not in places such as Jangpura, Hauz Khas Village, Defence Colony, Greater Kailash-II, Malviya Nagar, New Friends Colony or any other similar localities in the city where you would expect a non-diplomat white expat to reside (African expats of Delhi are another story, of course).Instead, designer Elena Tommaseo, a native of Venice in Italy, lives in Lajpat Nagar. Elena is the only white person living in the vicinity, and this warm evening she is to dazzle us with her take on Indo-Italian fusion cuisine.Little did we know that gaining a glimpse into her kitchen would bring us closer to the texture of Delhis multilayered expat life.Elena had originally promised to make bathua risotto  so far we have had this leafy vegetable only at home, stuffed in a parantha or mixed with curd. Our rendezvous begins with a disappointment.Opening the door, she tells us apologetically that she had forgotten that the season of bathua was over. So now, she has decided to make for us her real home-made Italian pasta with real Italian flour.Accordingly, we find Elenas drawing room turned into a makeshift pasta-making factory. She has fixed the gleaming pasta machine on one side of her dining table and alone she is performing the complicated process of rolling out the dough into long narrow pasta strips.On finding herself being photographed, she looks alarmed and says, Oh no! Please dont portray me as some crazy Italian woman who rolls out pasta every night in her home... please mention that I often make simple dal chawal for dinner!It is, after all, Elenas seventh year in the country, long enough for her to develop a taste for Indian khana. At times, she even goes to the extent of ordering dal makhani from Mughal, a nearby restaurant just behind Eros cinema. (Her kitchen rack stands out with one of its takeaway boxes.)Like most Delhiwallas, Elena is hypersensitive about her address  this has been her flat for four years. Its true Im living in Lajpat Nagar but Im more of a Jangpura person... I just dont have the budget for its high rents.Though these two neighbourhoods are next to each other, the green expansive Jangpura feels a continent away from the congested Lajpat Nagar. (Next to Jangpura is the beautiful Nizamuddin East, which is even more vulgar in its rents.)Even so, we find Elenas neighbourhood quite charming. Hers is a park-facing flat. Alas, the park has neither grass nor flowers, and is teeming with a large number of women and children. Its a little too alive, she says. Without any bitter feelings, Elena talks of the long wakeful nights when the neighbourhood hosts devi jagrans and mata ki chowki prayers in the park the whole night long, with the loudspeaker playing devotional bhajans.To be sure, Elena is lucky in having kind neighbours who occasionally invite her for a cup of chai. It is another matter that she is extraordinarily shy of giving them a chance to showcase their hospitality.  Im always asked the same questions during these visits, she says with an amused sigh. Have you married? If I say no, then the next question is  what is your age?Are you married? We ask Elena.She makes a face.Delhis friendly auto-rickshaw drivers also show an active interest in Elenas marital status. By now, she has developed a standard response to quickly kill the curiosity  Yes, Im married. Yes, my husband is a businessman. Yes, I have two children. Yes, one boy, one girl.We follow Elena into her kitchen. She begins the preparations for the pastas tomato sauce by opening a tetra pack of factory-made tomato puree. It tastes better than the Indian tamatar, she says, her voice betraying a hint of contempt as she utters the word tamatar. The Indian tomato tastes too mild, she declares.Picking up a bottle of oil, she says mournfully, I have to use the extra-virgin olive oil from Spain... we Italians are just not good in selling ours abroad.Finally, the meal is ready to be served and Elena arranges the table, complete with forks and knives  not to forget the Indian-made red wine in the wine glass. It is almost feeling like as if we are in Italy. Just then a pressure cooker gives out a shrill whistle from one of the kitchens in the neighbourhood. The aroma of arhar dal wafts through Elenas window. The Italian spell gets broken.But the pasta is truly delicious."

He reportedly offered power to the state at Rs 1.75 per unit. The CM said he will review all power purchase agreements (PPAs) to assess the cost differential.In response to a suggestion by Ambani for introducing the metro rail service in Punjab as public-private partnership, the CM invited his firm to study the urban transport system in Ludhiana to explore the possibility of setting up an elevated metro.Ambani also sought land for setting up testing ranges for his firms new defence projects, while Goenka showed interest in setting up a tractor tyre plant in Punjab. The chief minister (CM) invited the industrialists to explore viability of their projects, assuring them of the governments support in providing land and other facilities. He reportedly offered land to Ambani in Bathinda and Rajpura.Mahindra for digitising urban local bodiesAmarinder also welcomed Anand Mahindras offer for digitisation of the states urban local bodies. Tech Mahindra is also keen to set up Dial 100 emergency response system.Responding to Mahindras request for land and incentive package for Swaraj tractors, finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal said about 100 acres of land was available in Bathinda, the strategic gateway to Rajasthan and Haryana. Badal also sought Mahindras support for the hara tractor scheme, which was part of the Congress poll manifesto.While Mahindra stressed the need for a certification body to ensure quality of potatoes in Punjab (the company is supplying potatoes to McCain), Hindustan Unilever Ltd CEO and MD Sanjiv Mehta expressed his companys interest in procuring tomatoes and citrus fruits on a large scale from the state for its Kisan jams and squashes. The meeting with Mehta centred on collaboration with the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) to enhance production of tomatoes.Free wifi in schools, collegesReliance Industries Ltd (RIL) head Mukesh Ambani has promised free wifi to government educational and health institutions in Punjab.

This is the result of a month-long planning of the event. We wanted to execute it in a way that people of this region have never seen it before. Even while ensuring big-time fun, safety of the participants was our cornerstone. We are happy about the turnout. This being our first event, we must say that weve made a good beginning, said B. Pavan, one of the three partners. The other two are Ch. Sandeep and B. Rushi.With the active support of Y Square, a city-based business incubator, the boys carted in nearly 1,700 kg of tomatoes for the la Tomatino event.To generate slush, they watered the area on the previous night and made a group of workers pound the ground constantly using their feet. Weeding out stones and pebbles from the area to make sure it was fit for the revellers to enjoy their dance or play was a challenge, admitted Pavan.We had designed the event keeping youth in mind. It was heart-warming to see small children frolicking around the place. Couples with their children thoroughly enjoyed it, said Sandeep.Organic gulalThe trio brought in organic colours from Hyderabad. We used 500 kg organic gulal in five different colours.

Understanding this core aspect, the school is ensuring that these facilities are available for students, said S.L. Omkar, headmaster of the school.About the small kitchen garden maintained by students with the help of teachers on the school premises, he said that they grow common vegetables such as tomato, brinjal, ladys finger and leafy vegetables.We use these vegetables to prepare the midday meal. Though we need other vegetables too, we try to cultivate as many vegetables as possible to meet the daily requirement, he said.P.M. Pujari, an assistant teacher, said that the School Development Management Committee (SDMC) has been giving full support to the school.It is difficult to develop the school and maintain quality in education without the complete backing and encouragement of the SDMC, she said.Ms. Pujari said that recently, the SDMC installed loudspeakers in each classroom to help students listen to special student-centric programmes aired by All India Radio.Sharing her views, Lakshmi Badiger, a class eight student, said that the students are proud to be studying in such a school.How many schools have kitchen gardens. Here, we not only study our syllabus but also learn to be close to nature, she said."

Having burnt their fingers growing the negative crop of tobacco, the price of which is governed more by the global demand-supply situation on which they have no control, they decided to go in for organic fruits and vegetables. Now, it is a satisfying experience to grow healthy food through cow-based agriculture after growing for long the cancer-causing tobacco, they said in a conversation with The Hindu . They use only natural fertilizer 'ganajeevamrutham' produced with cow dung and cow urine and biopesticides made from neem and other leaves.There is no problem in marketing the organic vegetables and fruits, as health-conscious people on their own come to our farms from Ongole and other places to buy the farm fresh produce at our doorstep, says a progressive farmer D. Yellamanda Reddy, who grows, among other vegetables, cabbage, cauliflower, capsicum, brinjal and tomato.We also have the satisfaction of contributing our mite in fighting climate change and global warming, says Mr. Yellamanda Reddy, proudly showing the just-harvested healthy brinjal, free of insect infestation.The organic farmers in the village have installed micro irrigation systems such as sprinklers and drip irrigation to ensure much-needed wetting for the crop at a time when a majority of farmers are struggling to save their crops following severe drought in the district for the third successive year.Organic practices adopted by a select group of progressive farmers in the village include residue mulching, composting and crop rotation to maintain soil health, adds another progressive farmer in the village, Rajagopala Reddy, who focusses on growing greens, particularly fenugreek, which is most sought-after by those having high cholesterol, diabetes and renal diseases.This system of cultivation helps in restoration of the severe biodiversity loss associated with inorganic chemical-based farming which kills useful insects, rats, frogs and snakes upsetting the food-chain in the ecosystem, adds yet another progressive farmer D. Chennappa Reddy, while explaining the three-year time he took to restore the soil health affected because of repeated use of chemical fertilizers."

One of the teams visited Mettur Dam in the evening and took stock of the storage level.After assessing the drought-situation in Dharmapuri, the team comprising B. Ganesh Ram, Ratna Prasad and Paul Pandian inspected the damaged tomato crops at Marakottai village and cow peas at Aranganur village in Salem.At Mettur Dam, the team collected details of storage level, inflow and discharge from the dam on various occasions for farm activities in the Cauvery delta districts.District Collector V. Sampath made a power point presentation to the team members at the Mettur inspection bungalow on the grim situation and the severity of the drought conditions prevailing in the district for the past many months.The Collector also drew the attention of the Central team to the meagre water storage in the other reservoirs such as Aanaimaduvu, Kariakovil and also in all the major and minor water bodies of the district. C. N. Maheswaran, Commissioner of Social Security Schemes, accompanied the team.The second team comprising Vijay Rajmohan, Director (Trade, Extension and Drought Management), Union Ministry of Agriculture and Santhosh, Assistant Advisor, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, which arrived here after completing the visit of Namakkal, inspected the affected maize fields at Rayanpatti.The team members told presspersons at Veerapandi that they would leave for New Delhi after completing the tour of Tamil Nadu on January 25 and will submit its report to the Centre.This team was accompanied by Dheeraj Kumar, Managing Director, TWAD Board, R. Sukumar, District Revenue Officer, P. Soundararajan, Joint Director of Agriculture, and other officials.In Namakkal district, the team visited three villages and assessed the ground reality and interacted with farmers. Mohammad Nasimuddin, Principal Secretary to Government, Welfare of Differently Abled Persons and District Monitoring Officer and Collector M. Asia Mariam also accompanied it.The team visited a farm at Rasampalayam where 168 coconut trees had withered. The team accessed the dried-up cotton plants in Singalandapuram, withered onion crops and tapioca plants at Bodinaickenpatti.In Krishnagiri, the Central team was told that the district had a rainfall shortage of 30 per cent impacting on 50 per cent of crop productivity of millets and pulses.Collector C.Kathiravan accompanied the team that inspected Bargur, Pochampalli and Uthangarai.The administration told the team that about 1,09,065 hectares was brought under rain-fed cultivation. Of these, a total of 27,452 hectares has been severely hit by drought. Over 50 per cent of the affected area was under millets, groundnuts and the productivity was affected.In turn, this had caused 3,000 tonnes fodder shortage for livestock.The district ought to receive an average 830 mm rainfall. However, it received only around 590 mm.The team inspected fields under pulses and groundnut crop in Bargur block. Interacting with individual farmers in Sivampatty village and Nadupatty village in Bargur, the team sought information on the extent of damage to crops and the overall impact of drought on the fields, that were largely under groundnuts and other pulses crops.The team also visited groundnut, pulses and millets fields at Oilapatty village in Pochampalli and Dasampatty village in Uthangarai.In Erode, dried-up crops and parched fields stared at the Central officials. The team first went to Nochipalayam village and found that mulberry, coconut and sugarcane crops had dried up on vast swathes of fields. The farmers could not save the crops in spite of adoption of drip irrigation and other effective water management practices. The impact was indeed severe, Vijayaraj Mohan, senior official representing the Union Agriculture Ministry said, after observing that a cocoon unit had to be closed down due to non-availability of water.District Collector S. Prabakar pointed out the dry sugarcane stalks to the Central team.At Attayampalayam, the officials took stock of the complete damage to papaya, mango and other crops. Farmers here said they had gone ahead with heavy investments for raising the crops in anticipation of rainfall.Implementation of the Pandiyaru-Punnambazha scheme would be the only long-term solution for preventing recurrence of drought in the district, a farmer said, while narrating the inability of agriculturists to find fodder for their livestock due persistent dry conditions. The team finally visited Samigoundanpalayam village to assess the damage to turmeric crop.On Wednesday, the team will visit Surapalayam and Moolakarai in Erode block to estimate damage to tapioca, turmeric and tomato crops, and Thalayampalayam, Karukkupalayam and Bolanaickenpalayam in Perundurai block to analyse drought impact on groundnut, cotton and maize crops.(Reporting by Syed Muthahar Saqaf in Salem, P.V.

The Act makes it mandatory for farmers to sell their produce only to the licensed merchants at the mandis of Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) by paying the commission and other charges.Denotification of fruits and vegetables, according to the Centre, will put an end to a chain of commission agents between the farmers and the consumers, creating a win-win situation for both. Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made a strong pitch for the denotification and promoting contract farming in his 2017-18 Budget presented recently.But the Karnataka government holds a different view. We have no intention to denotify perishables (from the Act). Even now the farmers are free to sell their produce directly to consumers anywhere, including APMC yards. Moreover, the government will not be in a position to intervene and provide justice to the farmers if the traders refuse to pay judicious price, Additional Secretary to Co-operation department (APMC reforms) R Manoj said.As per the Department of Agriculture Marketing, cost to the supply chain due to handling of fruits and vegetables at APMCs is only 6% of the total cost of the produce. Cost of supply chain include 5% commission and 1% hamali and other handling cost. This cost will be significantly higher in unorganised sector due to involvement of middlemen at multiple levels.Interestingly, the ruling Congress has refused to denotify perishables despite directions from the party vice president Rahul Gandhi to all the Congress-ruled state governments in 2014. Instead, the Karnataka government exempted levy of market fee on farmers (1.5% on fruits and 1% on vegetables) and made a provision for retail sales at APMC yards.Chairman of Food Processing Committee of Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industries Bharat Shah said APMCs help farmers get competitive price to their produce due to the involvement of large number of traders. Besides, the farmers get necessary logistical support such as storage place at APMCs. As far as consumers are concerned, prices of fruits and vegetables are normally the lowest at APMCs compared to other places, he added, opposing the move to denotify perishables."

Two days ago, I spotted them on a different plant (Ashoka tree) in Maharashtra. We need to have more studies to find out their prevalence and their counter measures, NBAIR scientist Sunil Joshi, who led the team, told DH.One of the insects Kilifia acuminata was found on an ornamental fern in Bengaluru, but may threaten mango trees in future, as seen in Egypt. India ranks first among the worlds mango-producing countries, accounting for about 50% of mango production.Southern states like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala have a large area under mango cultivation, and the pest can easily spread from Kerala to other states if left unchecked.Reported from 35 countries around the world, it is also a threat to litchi, jamun, guava, pear, lemon and coffee plants.Another insect called Protopulvinaria longivalvata was found on a pepper climber grown in a kitchen garden. The scientists describe it as a serious pest as the vine was killed by the insects.Joshi and his colleagues reported in the journal Current Science that they collected this insect in large numbers from Vittal, Karnataka which is near the major pepper-growing area of Kasargod in Kerala.The insect can easily spread to such areas in Kerala and become a serious pest, they said.The third species Trijuba oculata was also reported from Bengaluru and Mandya. It could be a threat to custard apple trees and grapevines in Karnataka and Maharashtra.The fourth species Pulvinaria urbicola, Joshi said, was a notoriously destructive one that can be a big threat to potato, tomato, brinjal, bell pepper and capsicum. This too was spotted in Bengaluru, the scientists said in a separate paper in the journal Zootaxa."

This is resulting in a mismatch with supply far exceeding the demand, says N. Mohan Reddy, a farmer of Kothagadi in Vikarabad district.Crop given upInstances of farmers digging up fields in preparation of new crop without harvesting the standing crop have been reported from the neighbouring Ranga Reddy, Vikarabad and other districts, known for extensive cultivation of vegetables. A visitor to Vikarabad district will come across fields ploughed with remnants of carrot.The cost of 10 kg of carrot plunged to Rs. 30 to Rs. 50 at a time when the production cost is expected to be much higher. The prices showed an upward trend since past couple of days, but the offer price still continues on the lower side. A farmer incurs expenditure to the tune of Rs. 60,000 an acre with expected yield of over 100 quintals of carrot. But, he would end up with losses when selling at Rs. 50 for 10 kg as it would hardly match the investment and he would still have to bear the plucking and transportation charges as overheads.Another reason for the drop in prices is said to be the delay in harvesting of the crop by farmers in anticipation of good returns. This would ultimately inflict damage to at least a portion of the crop and thereby, farmers end up in accumulated losses. The case was no different when the price of tomato dropped steeply in the open market. The current price of tomato ranges from Rs. 250 to Rs. 300 for 25 kg box, but it was traded at less than Rs. 75 per box during the previous season.Private super market chains, bulk buyers of the produce, decide about the procurement price and farmers complain that they would fix the prices without factoring in the input and other costs incurred by them. The Agriculture Marketing Department has deployed officers for bulk sourcing of vegetables from these growers so that it could market the produce on cost-to-cost basis to the consumers.MismatchThe department fixes the prices for each variety of vegetable based largely on the existing market price. But given the mismatch in the demand and supply, prices tend to be on the lower side most of the times, an official engaged in procurement said.Several farmers complain that the absence of support prices to vegetables has become a bane for farmers as the short duration crops are subject to market conditions and there is no guarantee of fixed return on them. The significant rise in labour costs, thanks to the rural employment guarantee programme, had escalated their input cost further, but there has been no support from the Government in the form of announcement of minimum support price for vegetables.There is also no mechanism to enlighten farmers about the likely demand-supply situation and no advisories are coming forth to enable the ryots to take up varieties that were likely to assure at least return of the amounts invested on the crop.Market interventionExperts are of the view that unlike in European countries where Government would intervene in times of glut to avoid crash in prices, there is no mechanism in the country to educate farmers on selection of crops.Moreover, prices are fixed by the consumers, procuring agencies and not producers. There is an urgent need for enhancing extension activities by deploying officials exclusively to educate farmers about the suitability of the crop as also the likely situation when their produce reaches the market, said M. Uma Devi, Director of Water Technology Centre of the Prof. Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University."

They are using the services of tankers to irrigate the farm land.About five persons in Lakhya and Lakshmipura own tankers to supply water for crops.All the lakes, water bodies and borewells in the village have dried up. Gange Halla (Vedavathi river) stopped flowing in the region three decades ago. The groundwater table has declined drastically.The farmers removing pumpsets from the defunct borewells are a common scene at Lakhya village. They are eagerly waiting for tankers that arrive from cities to fetch water to safeguard cattle and crops.A private borewell owner at Kote Layout charges Rs 100 for filling a water tanker. By the time the tanker reaches farm land, the farmers have to shell out Rs 1,200 to Rs 1,300. The farmers have been struggling to save tomato, black pepper, areca nut and coconut.Tanker water supplier Shashidhar said, On an average, I supply water in six trips in a day. Those who have drip irrigation facility and borewells have dried up purchase water from tankers to save their crops.Farmer Ramesh said, I have cultivated tomato on two acres of land. The borewells have dried up. The tomato plants have started flowering. For the survival of plants till monsoon, I spend Rs 2,500 daily for the purchase of water from tankers. I had not dreamt that such a situation will come up in Chikkamagaluru district. Farming and farmers are on the verge of extinction.I have been struggling to purchase seeds and fertilisers. A situation has arisen where we have to seek financial assistance for purchasing water as well, he said.Farmers Sabeer Khan and Sayyed Sadik said, Looking at tomato plants cultivated on three acre land withering, we decided to purchase water to save the plants.L V Basavaraju had cultivated black pepper as a secondary crop with areca nut on a three acres of land. For the survival of pepper vines, he purchases six tankers of water daily.Farmers from Lakhya, Lakshmipura, Kanive and Kuruvangi are mostly cultivating vegetables and supplying to the market. They are self-sufficient with farming and dairy farming. However, with the drought situation prevailing in the region, saving the crops and cattle have become a challenge for the farmers.Environmentalist D V Girish said, River Gowrihalla, which originates in Shola forest of Mullayyanagiri, passes through Dasarahalli, Kanive to reach Lakhya. Later, the water body flows to Ayyanakere, Sakharayapatna, Kadur, Hosadurga and becomes Vedavathi river. The water from the river will be used by the farmers for irrigating the farm land. With the thinning of forest in the hilly range due to forest fire, the sources of river have dried up. As the river is not flowing, the farm land became arid and dry in the region."

Farmers growing tomatoes are a happy lot as a sudden spurt in prices has brought smiles on their faces but the increased rates are burning a hole in the consumers pocket.A month ago tomatoes were being sold for as low as Rs 5 but today they are available for Rs 30 to Rs 40 depending on their size and quality. Nagaraj of HOPCOMS told DH that tomatoes are supplied to the city from Mysuru taluk but for the past one week only 500 kg of tomatoes were arriving at market places every day. The supply was insufficient to meet the demand. He said a decline in supply was contributing to the recent hike in prices.Farmers who had taken up tomato cultivation on a large scale a few months ago had to face huge losses as the prices crashed due to a bumper yield. With the procurement price going below Rs two per kg, farmers were badly affected. A crate (20 kg) of tomatoes was fetching them around Rs 50 but unable to meet the transportation cost, most of the farmers left the fruits to rot in the plant.With the region affected due to severe drought, only a few farmers equipped with pump sets are growing tomatoes and are seeing a good profit with each kilo of tomato (depending on the quality) fetching them approximately Rs 40.TN dependent on stateWith the neighbouring state Tamil Nadu also facing a shortage, tomatoes grown in Karnataka, especially from Chamarajanagar district, are being supplied in large quantities to Erode, Coimbatore, Madurai, Mettupalayam and also to Kerala.Thanks to the demand, traders are camping in the border district to directly purchase tomatoes from farmers who are being paid Rs 20 per kg at their doorsteps. The direct sales have resulted in tomatoes not reaching markets and also effecting a sudden hike in prices. Only 200 crates of tomatoes are being supplied to the market every day in Chamarajanagar district. Some farmers in Gundlupet and Hanur are growing tomatoes extensively to supply to the Kerala market."

The seer, who has been strongly propagating conservation of native cow breeds, was speaking at the Mahamangala of Mangala Gou Yatre organised at Kulur.Asserting that the study of indigenous cattle breeds assumes profound significance, the seer said there should be dedicated universities to study the benefits of cattle products. The cattle has better health benefits that can also get rid of the problems plaguing the country, he said. Karnataka Bank MD and CEO P Jayaram Bhat said the apathy towards traditional agriculture is the result of ignoring cattle-based agrarian activities. Such confernces reinfuse agriculture and spread the significance cattle to the world, he remarked.Dr Sadana from Karnal in Haryana said Panchagavya (prepared using five products of cow - cowdung, urine, milk, curd and ghee) is not just sacred, but also has medicinal value and is rich in proteins. It also helps in keeping nerves and nano particles in the body, he said. Veterinary expert from Bengaluru Dr K P Ramesh said an estimated 40 Desi breeds have survived in the country. Four among them are considered for high yielding milk, 10 with dual benefits and remaining used for laborious works, he added.He said Indian breeds are capable of facing any changes in weather and it is the only reason why most of the scientists across the globe are conducting research into such interest aspects in the cattle, he added.The change in crop pattern, especially by growing tomato in the fields rich with black soil earlier meant for cotton is also a reason for depleting cow breeds. Krishna valley breed is on the verge of extinction due to this reason, he added. Chairman of Agri System Foundation, Coimbatore, Dr E Vadivel said Panchagavya also helps in increasing crop yields. This fact has also been proven in field experiments, he added."

Saraswathi said she was scheduled to address a roadside meeting atop a four-wheeler last evening when members of the rival AIADMK (Puratchi Thalaivi Amma), including former chief minister O Panneerselvam and their candidate E Madhusudhanan, were passing through after canvassing for votes. I switched off the microphone and waited for them to cross but suddenly some of their supporters started abusing us and demanded that our vehicle be removed from the place, she told PTI.We had sought police permission for the meeting, therefore, we remained calm when suddenly some of them started hurling footwear, stones and bottles at us, she said. Three of my supporters sustained injury in the incident, she claimed. However, the Panneerselvam camp denied the allegations and said a footwear and tomato were hurled at her from nearby houses and not from the ground level.Aspire K Swaminathan, Panneerselvam camps Media Coordinator said, The campaign team comprising the former chief minister and Madhusudhanan wanted to take a right turn, so a request was made to the rival camp to make way. She (Saraswathi) suddenly started shouting but Panneerselvam asked us to remain calm. Suddely, a slipper was hurled at her from somewhere even as someone else threw a tomato at her, he said. Denying the role of Panneerselvams supporters in the incident, Swaminathan claimed that the attacks did not emanate from the ground level, but from nearby houses.At no point will our leadership get into such activities. This incident is a manifestation of peoples anger at her leadership, he said. Police said they have not received any complaint on the matter and declined to divulge further details. The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) suffered a vertical split on February 7 after then chief minister Panneerselvam revolted against jailed party chief V K Sasikala, alleging he had been forced to make way for her elevation to the states top post.Later, some MLAs and MPs from AIADMK also switched to his side. Both factions have fielded candidates for the R K Nagar bypoll, necessitated by the demise of sitting MLA and former chief minister J Jayalalithaa. The Election Commission has barred the factions from using the name AIADMK and its two leaves symbol. The Sasikala faction has opted for the name AIADMK (Amma) and has fielded Sasikalas nephew and former MP, T T V Dhinakaran. He is contesting on hat symbol. Madhusudhanan, a party veteran, is seeking votes for electric pole symbol.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Bots appear to behave differently in culturally distinct online environments.The findings are a warning to those using artificial intelligence for building autonomous vehicles, cyber security systems or for managing social media.We may have to devote more attention to bots diverse social life and their different cultures, researchers said.The research found that although the online world has become an ecosystem of bots, our knowledge of how they interact with each other is still rather poor.Although bots are automatons that do not have the capacity for emotions, bot to bot interactions are unpredictable and act in distinctive ways.Researchers found that German editions of Wikipedia had fewest conflicts between bots, with each undoing anothers edits 24 times, on average, over ten years.This shows relative efficiency, when compared with bots on the Portuguese Wikipedia edition, which undid another bots edits 185 times, on average, over ten years, researchers said.Bots on English Wikipedia undid another bots work 105 times, on average, over ten years, three times the rate of human reverts, they said. The findings show that even simple autonomous algorithms can produce complex interactions.While bots constitute a tiny proportion (0.1%) of Wikipedia editors, they stand behind a significant proportion of all edits.Although such conflicts represent a small proportion of bots overall editorial activity, the findings are significant in highlighting their unpredictability and complexity.We find that bots behave differently in different cultural environments and their conflicts are also very different to the ones between human editors, said Milena Tsvetkova, from the Oxford Internet Institute.This has implications not only for how we design artificial agents but also for how we study them. We need more research into the sociology of bots, said Ms. Tsvetkova."

It is the problem of plenty troubling the Chhota Udepur tomato farmers.It is the problem of plenty troubling the Chhota Udepur tomato farmers. Many tomato farmers have been forced to discard their crops, as there are no takers. And in the wholesale market, the price of one mound or 25 kg tomato has plummeted to Rs 20 which was Rs 500 last year during the same period.Shantilal Tadvi, 52, had hoped that the harvest of his tomato fields located in the Panej village of Bodeli taluka of Chhota Udepur district would bring cheer to the family this year. However, currently, his harvest of plump, heavy tomatoes is packed in 130 cartons, awaiting a pick up to Ankleshwar and southern Gujarat, where he has been traditionally supplying the fruit. Tadvi is expecting to make at least Rs 100 per maund but is unsure if his best quality crop will fetch the price. The ongoing wholesale rates for tomatoes are as low as Rs 20 per maund.Watch what else is making newsTadvi, like many other farmers in the district, is in distress. Last year, he says, the price for the tomatoes was as much as Rs 500 per maund. I have close to 133 maunds of the first round of harvest. The field will be ready for the second round of harvest soon. At the current wholesale price, I do not know how will I be able to sustain my family of six for the coming months.Many farmers in the district have simply discarded their crops for lack of takers. Through the approximately 15-kilometre stretch of the Bodeli-Naswadi road, lush green fields with red, mature tomatoes hanging in neat clusters wear a deserted look  in many cases the cherry red tomatoes fallen around the fields bear a testimony to the disinterest and helplessness with which farmers have abandoned the crops. This stretch has been a tomato belt for three states  Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.Another farmer Virpal Parmar says many farmers have been forced to throw away their crops to grazing cattle. Farmers are giving away tractors full of tomato vines to the grazers as they know that the crop will fetch no price in the wholesale market. Only those tomato growers, who have been able to produce heavy, large sized fruits will stand a chance of their produce being picked up this year as compared to the small, tart varieties. Most families are in deep distress, says Parmar.The sudden decision to demonetise the currency in November has had a cascading effect on the functioning of the APMC markets and the business of wholesalers, who are unwilling to deal in big numbers, says Parmar.A grazier, Valu Dhana, from Jasdan in Rajkot, has arrived in Chhota Udepur with a large cattle herd. Dhana says he has been fetching several kilograms of tomatoes from nearby villages to feed his cattle for the last one week. As the tomato harvest season came to a close, farmers started telling me to take away their discarded yields of ripe tomatoes as they have no value this year. I have brought in several tractors full for the last 10 days and the cattle are feeding on the tomatoes, says Dhana.Tadvi adds that the farmers are forced to do away with the crop as the cost of picking the fruit is costlier than its market value currently. Each labour has to be paid Rs 60 per day for plucking the ripe tomatoes. If the price is lower than Re 1 per kg in the wholesale market, it makes more sense to discard the crop than to waste money on harvesting it, says Tadvi.However, Chhota Udepur APMC Chairman Atul Patel says that the sharp decline in the prices is due to a bumper crop this year, and not demonetisation. There is a bumper crop this year and that is the only reason why the prices have fallen low. The farmers are discarding the crop right now because we do not have facility for cold storage and it is one of those harvests that is extremely perishable. The prices will soon increase as the season ends, Patel said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Express photo The prisons department has 588 hectares of agricultural land under it across the state. Express photoPRISON agriculture in Maharashtra has gone beyond just a rehabilitation and reformation programme for prisoners. The prison agricultural production across 29 prisons in the state has grown leaps and bounds and stands at almost Rs 4 crore in 2016 as compared to Rs 2.54 crore two years ago. The profits from production has also increased by 15-20 per cent. Across the 588 hectares of agricultural land held by the prisons department, the last year saw new technologies, more suitable crops and implementation of schemes in coordination with government departments, the agriculture university and NGOs. Every year, over 800 prisoners are engaged in agricultural activities and avail remissions based on the number of days they work on a farm.Sanjay Phadtare, Technical Officer, Agriculture, Prisons (Maharashtra), said, Farming is the most sought-after activity among prisoners. It gives them remissions. Besides, they are not working within four walls. Remissions and exemptions are given to those that are serving life imprisonment and depending on the number of days he works in the field and his conduct, he will avail remissions. The more he works, the less days he spends in the jail.The prisoners receive wages anywhere between Rs 40 and Rs 55 per day. Last year, a total of Rs 83.29 lakh in wages were paid to prisoners engaged in farming, steep rise compared to previous years.B K Upadhyay, Additional DG and IG, Prisons (Maharashtra), said, We have about 800 hectares of land available, of which over 500 are agricultural land, 57 per cent of which is under irrigation and rest are rain-fed. While the farming programme was started as a rehabilitation activity, it has gained a lot of momentum with a variety of produces, plantation and allied activities being undertaken by us.From the traditional cereal cultivation like rice and wheat, most prisons have now started producing fenugreek, spinach, Rajgira, tomato, potato, onion, ginger and pumpkin.In Punes Yerawada jail, a large area is dedicated to banana tissue culture and mushroom production, besides citrus plantation in Morshi prison and even mulberry plantation in Visapur jail. Sandalwood plantation is also being undertaken in a few prisons including Yerawada and Nashik.Bamboo, mango, teak, jamun and been are also being planted in the available forest area. Also undertaken on a large scale are goat farming, poultry, horticulture, dairy and fisheries.From 2014-2016, we received a funding of about Rs 1.44 crore from the government and we have been using it to enhance technology and increase wages, said Phadtare.The department, apart from improving the quality of seeds and fertilisers, has invested in drip irrigation, over 20 tractors, farm equipment, electric motors and pumps, new crops and seed production, new irrigation methods and even organic farming such as vermi-compost and also biogas plants. A soil analysis was also undertaken with the help of fertilisers that resulted in enhanced production.Earlier, the rates of the produce from our farms were low. Now, we go by the APMC rates. Therefore, the produce gets proper rates. While some of the produce is consumed in jails, the rest is sold in the market. While we have supervisors within the prison, we get help and training from agricultural departments, nearby institutes and even local farmers to improve the skills of prisoners, added Phadtare.According to the department, more funds have been sought from the government. Currently, of the 55 jails, 29 have land for farming, most of which are open prisons. We are also planning to manufacture agricultural equipment also within the prison premises to make us more self-sufficient, added Upadhyay.radhika.ramaswamy@expressindia.comFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Do not ashame me by referring that I am most able minister in the state. I am, in fact, the most inefficient and helpless minister in the government, Rout said in the assembly while replying an adjournment debate on closure of sugar mills causing frustration among farmers.Rout having 40-years experience in politics, said he had brought laurels for the state as Pancahayati Raj, Agriculture and other ministers.But, I have failed in the Cooperation department, Rout said.Rout, who hold the Cooperation portfolio said: I am pained that most of the members of this House refer me as the most efficient. But, in reality, I am not because of the hurdles being put on my way.Though the entire House including leader of opposition Narasingha Mishra of Congress, was surprised over Routs statement, he went on speaking that it was very difficult to run a democratic government under bureaucratic influence.The minister said he did not get adequate support from the bureaucracy to take up welfare programmes, be it revival of defunct sugar mills or cold storages which could help farmers to a great extent.Had we sufficient cold storages, our farmers will not go for distress sale of vegetables besides potatoes and tomatoes, Rout said adding that he now tries to set up cold storages with help of RMC (regulated market committee).The minister also said that though he has a lot of ideas to help the farmers and make Cooperation department viable, he could not do it because of the lack of attitude and cooperation from the bureaucracy.Rout also admitted in the House that the farmers are under duress for closure of sugar mills and cold storages.Earlier, Leader of Opposition Naraisngha Mishra of Congress had alleged that the state government failed to help the sugarcane farmers across the state. He said the farmers do not get their dues from the sugar mills run by the cooperative societies.Rout said there are five sugar mills in the state of which only two were in operation. Remaining three sugar mills have been closed due to several factors and his efforts to revive such units has faced hurdles from the bureaucracy.The minister, however, assured the House that he would again try to make such defunct sugar mills operational.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

In his subsequent speeches to the people of the country through election rallies and his radio programme, Mann Ki Baat the Prime Minister asked the country to co-operate with him for fifty days after which the results of demonetisation and its impact on black money would be felt. At the end of fifty days the situation in the country is still not anywhere near normal and we still have no answers to the question asked-* Has Demonetisation achieved its purpose, is there a figure to the amount of black money recovered, have terrorism activities shown a fall, have all the counterfeit notes been recovered?* Has the amount of currency in circulation (approximately 86%) that was wiped out in the exercise been replenished and can life be normal again with withdrawal limits on ATM and bank counters removed?* Will the government compensate the farmers who faced losses, daily wage labourers who lost their jobs, families of the 115 dead, the small businesses that faced the brunt of demonetisation?In hope to get answers to these questions the country tuned into PM Modis address on the last day of 2016 sadly what he spoke was on the last day of last year was also a rehash of all his speeches in the past fifty days speaking of the benefits of demonetisation but unable to quantify it even after fifty days of demonetisation. He did announce schemes that were already in place ( Maternity benefits of Rs 6000 being one of them). What is also unfortunate to hear is how the prime minister continues to mislead the people through his election speeches by claiming that demonetisation has ended black money, terrorism and counterfeit notes. Asking him to back it with facts would be near impossible for him to do.The impact and strain on the economy started to show within the fifty days of the announcement, it has managed to paralyze the agricultural economy. Rabi crops have taken a severe hit. Cash crops like tomato and onions have been selling at Re.1/kg and 50 paisa/kg respectively. Modi government put a unilateral embargo on 370 District Central Cooperative Banks and over 93,000 Agricultural Credit Societies, thereby denying agriculture credit to the farmers. Small and Medium industries are shutting down with massive job losses reported in Indias manufacturing hubs such as Tirupur, Faridabad, Ludhiana, Surat and other small and big industrial hubs are also revising their growth estimates. The unorganised sector has been deeply hit too. The unfortunate reality is that the honest cash economy of India, which is the biggest job generator, has been attacked by this unilateral decision of the Modi Government.As the country awaits to hear from the Reserve Bank of India or the government for actual figures of the post-Demonetisation India order the estimates by leading economists including Dr. Manmohan Singh suggest the GDP will decline by 2% or more , RBI has kept it at 0.5%. As per Centre for Monitoring of Indian Economy, loss in first 50 days was an estimated Rs.1,28,000 crore. The Sensex and the Nifty managed to wipe off all the gains made in the year, RBI data released shows bank credit growth at a multi decade low of 5.1%.Composite PMI Output Index fell to47.6 in December, investor sentiment saw an all time low in the past 11 years. There is a near hire freeze in most sectors which could further add to the woes due to demonetisation.The government had initially estimated about 5 lakh crore rupees as black money would be rendered worthless after the demonetisation announcement however those estimates seem to have gone awry with almost 97% of it being deposited in the bank by the end of 31st December. These figures havent yet been declared by the RBI officially. The RBI is also refusing to accept anymore deposits of old currency except from NRIs, which clearly goes against the announcement made earlier on old notes could be deposited at RBI branches after the 31st December deadline was over.The trust deficit in anything the RBI says or the government announces is low with changes being made everyday and no clarity coming from any side. Even after close to two months it seems like it isgoing to be a really long wait for the country to realise, if any, the benefits of demonetisation. However what is most unfortunate is the post truth make believe reality we have been subjected to and the conviction that the countrymen will believe whatever is dished out as a fact by the government."

About nine thousand miles away in USA, my 22-year-old son has come up trumps after poring over my salad book and zeroing in on the salad for his next meal.The two boys are a generation and many continents apart and yet, this innocuous salad book is their constant tasteful companion, albeit for different reasons. The toddlers mother has bought him a whole slew of baby books featuring fruits and veggies but the little guy invariably picks up my salad book from his moms kitchen and sits down for his daily erudition. My older son, The Health Nut, while living the dolce vida in The Big Apple, is very conscious of his calorie intake like a lot of his generation and hence the salad book is whipped out every now and then.Gone are the days when salads were looked upon as slightly better than a bitter pill to swallow. No one ever tossed a salad for a midday meal or sat in front of the TV with a big bowl of healthy luscious leaves and veggies. And no one thought of salads as comfort foods!The current generation is different. Weaned on a diet of political correctness and nutritional knowledge, they are not comfortable with the ghee-cures-all attitude of the older generations. Salads have made their way into their lexicon along with words like YOLO and hashtag.With the temperature dipping in many parts of the country, when someone mentions comfort food, a lot of young gourmands think beyond steaming hot bowls of soup or mac-&-cheese. While a salad a few years back was not considered comfort food material, times are changing. A big dinner-size salad packed with winter fruits and veggies and delicious toppings can help fuel you through chilly, foggy days. Better still, it can do so without making you feel sluggish and weighed down.With the festive season almost over and done with, February is a time to enjoy the bounty of winter foods and markets filled with colorful winter produce. I love browsing the aisles of the supermarket looking at all the vibrant racks of fresh produce. The brilliance of the malta orange, the plumpness of scarlet strawberries, dewy fresh local berries, and verdant dark greens jostle in a cacophony of color on the grocery shelves. Light summer herbs are replaced by collards, mustard greens, spinach, brussel sprouts and my personal favorite, kale.The chill in winter means that there is a craving for food that is filling. For salad eaters like me, this means changing the typical salad to include hearty grains, bright citrus fruits, nuts, root vegetables and hardy winter greens.So here I am on a Saturday morning at our local supermarket trying to pick out the freshest veggies and fruits for a salad for dinner. On the menu tonight are quiches: a sundried tomato black olive quiche and a bacon quiche. I think a fruity salad would go well with the quiches. The malta oranges call out to me with their flaming bright colors. I pick up some green olives and red onions, a block of spicy pepper gouda cheese and I am all set for my familys favorite Triple-O salad (recipe below).To me, the Triple-O salad is an ideal winter salad. It is light and yet has the depth of flavor with its seasonal notes to stand up to hearty winter dishes. Its simple to make with its three to four ingredients, and can be varied based on your preferences or what you have at home.Just before I wind up my shopping, I pick up a bunch of luscious strawberries and a packet of baby spinach. This along with some pasta and stone-ground bread will make for a lovely lunch tomorrow.Back home, as I am walking in, my son calls in from NYC. Hey mom, I have chicken leftovers. Can you suggest a quick salad? I look at the oranges peeking out of my grocery bag, think about the plummeting temperatures in US and decide its time to have a Triple-O date in two cities. Take down this salad, I say to him crisply, as I start unpacking my groceries.TRIPLE-O SALAD:Ingredients:Green or black Olives: 12  15 (pitted)Red onion: 1 small , sliced into thin ringsOranges: 2 large, cut into  inch slices or sectionsCheese : any pepper or spicy cheese (optional)Dressing:1 tbsp olive oilJuice of 1-2 lemonsSalt and pepper (to taste)Method: Start by peeling the oranges, removing the seeds and cutting into neat slices and set aside. Cut the onion into thin onion rings. A trick I learnt a few years ago was to dunk the onions into boiling water for about 10-15 seconds, removing them and rinsing under cold water. This removes the pungency of the onion. Whisk together the oil, lemon juice and salt and pepper. Place the oranges in a plate, add the olives and red onions, and dribble the dressing on the top. You can add the cheese to the salad from the top or arrange it like I do, around the salad edges."

The most complex and visually striking example from the most sought-after series of the war period, Plant de tomates has been in a private collection for four decades since it was sold at Sothebys New York in 1976. This exquisite museum-quality work is expected to fetch 10,000,000  15,000,000 as part of Sothebys Impressionist & Modern Art Evening sale in London on 1 March 2017.Samuel Valette, Sothebys Senior International Specialist in Impressionist & Modern Art, commented: This exceptional work by Pablo Picasso was painted at a moment of particular tension during the war: the liberation of Paris. As such, it is infused with a sense of renewed energy and hope that distinguishes it from other wartime still-lifes, which were imbued with a more sombre and dark mood. It shows that there was light at the end of the tunnel. For Picasso, the very act of continuing to paint as normal was an act of resistance, and following the Liberation, his atelier became a must-see for the allied soldiers who wanted to witness what the master had created in the war years.In the summer of 1944, Picasso was staying with Marie-Thrse at the Boulevard Henri IV in the weeks before the Liberation of Paris from the Nazis by the Allied Forces. Picasso began to take notice of the potted tomato plant that was growing besides the window of the apartment. These were not uncommon in civilian households throughout Europe at a time when food rations limited the amount of available produce for consumption. Seeing the resilient plant as a sign of hope as it continued to bear fruit, Picasso painted five canvases of the plant on a window sill between August 3 and August 12, 1944  varying in degrees of abstraction. Thus he recorded this consequence of war as a source of admiration and a metaphor of human perseverance in times of strife.In this work, the branches of the plant are weighed down with the heavy tomatoes  their arched shapes standing in contrast with the strong horizontals and verticals of the window, which fragment the composition into a grid-like form. For his palette, Picasso chose vibrant shades of red and green to emphasise the lush and fertile nature of the plant. The background view outside the window is painted with varying shades of yellow and grey, calling to mind the smoke and gunfire that could be heard throughout the city during these frightening last weeks of the war. Rarely has Picasso invested a still-life with such meaning and sociological importance.Although not an active member of the Resistance movement, Picassos artistic activity during the war was deemed as heroic by many of his contemporaries around the world. His art was blacklisted by the Nazi regime and he was not permitted to exhibit his pictures publicly by government decree. However, by this point in his career, Picasso was financially secure and the paintings that he completed during this period remained in his studio  only to be exhibited after the war. A series of photographs that renowned photographer Cecil Beaton took of Picassos studio at rue des Grands-Augustins, several of them showing this work, gives remarkable insight into Picassos work during this period. In the days leading to the Liberation  and in the midst of his painting of the tomato plant series  Picasso met with several British and American journalists and soldiers who wished to praise him for his accomplishment at his studio."

Now, if Bill Gates and other hi-tech crystal ball gazers are to be believed, the taxes part of that observation might apply to robots as well as to humans.Gates has been quoted as saying, Right now, the human worker who does, say, $50,000 worth of work in a factory, that income is taxed and you get income tax, social security tax, all those things. If a robot comes in to do the same thing, youd think that wed tax the robot at a similar level!The golden Gates might well have a valid point. Indeed, knowing that the taxman is famous  or infamous, depending on your point of view  for casting his net far and wide, robots might one day end up paying more tax than their human counterparts.Human taxpayers can  and do  claim a whole slew of tax rebates and exemptions, by way of maternity benefits, for example, which would not extend to the average robot.Initially, robots were programmed to do only assembly line work, at automobile and other mass production factories. But day by day their labour skills are growing exponentially.For instance, there are robots who can look after your needs at home, and do so with a punctiliousness unmatched by even the most accomplished of human domestic help.If PG Wodehouse had been around today would Jeeves, Bertie Woosters gentlemans personal gentleman be morphed into Jarvis, the gentlemans personal android? And would Beech, the august butler at Blandings Castle, find himself out-butlered from his job by a frockcoated Bestech, a mechanical major domo nonpareil?Robots are hitting below the belt, both metaphorically and literally. In a development that would have made Freud flip his id, for a growing number of people robots are becoming their sex objects of choice.As hard porn goes onto hard drive, a futuristic adult movie might well star an automated Sony Leone as its hot attraction. And an updated version of the Kama Sutra could be retitled the Cyborg Sutra. Whereupon a censorious robot group which could call itself the Mechanical Mahila Manch might well take out a morcha in protest and publicly set on fire the offending tomes along with an effigy of its automaton author.Such eventualities which today tax the imagination could tomorrow imaginatively be turned into machine-generated tax revenue.However, a problem could crop up. Any robot smart enough to be liable for tax would be smart enough to evade tax. On the principle that it takes a robot to catch a robot, the tax authorities could hire silicon sleuths to nab such evaders.However, such robotic revenue collectors might be as susceptible to bribery as humans, inspiring a reprise of Arthur Koestlers philosophical opus, The Ghoos in the Machine."

Like only the English would make a mince sweet and black pudding a meat dish. We grew up calling custard a pudding or a wobbly jelly with circles of banana embedded in it.I still dont know what is a scallop and it is amazing how some people measure your social worth by your knowledge of these pretentious culinary exercises.Like folks who order Mulligatawny soup like they were making a royal pronouncement from a scroll and you sit there not having the courage to ask what the heck it is, will have tomato soup instead, know that at least.

But, the vegetarian varieties that using mushroom or pumpkin or okras are also fairly common,"" says executive chef at Cidade de Goa, Sunit Sharma.The light yellowish-green gravy is prepared by grinding together a mix of spices like cumin, coriander, garlic and turmeric with grated coconut. The resultant paste is then strained to obtain what is called the first press coconut milk. The extraction of the second press follows post the addition of a little bit of water, and it is in the second press extract that the dish is prepared.Cooking the caldinho begins with a dash of chopped onions and some tomatoes that are used to give the curry some texture. But, one must keep in mind the acidity factor of the tomatoes during preparation. ""The tomatoes' acidic nature is highly likely to cause the coconut milk to curdle if you are not careful. It's important to use just the optimum amount of tomatoes to prevent the gravy from losing its flavour,"" says Oswin Pinto , owner and chef at Hogworth, Miramar. ""If you aren't sure, the best idea is to avoid the tomatoes entirely,"" he advises.ith its origins hidden in the ubiquitous broth or soup , the caldinho is yet another outcome of the amalgamation of Portuguese and Konkani influences that gives Goan cuisine its unique character Named after the caldo, which means soup in Portuguese, the caldinho is probably one of the most understated yet versatile dishes of the coastal state's culinary offerings.This creamy curry was once served at the dining table of the elite. ""Caldinho was eaten with bread by the rich as the first course of the meal during the Portuguese era. Besides the high-value fish, an entire coconut goes into making one plate of caldinho, which makes its preparation an expensive affair,"" says owner of Viva Panjim, Linda D'Souza.Unlike conventional curries that are heavy on spices and chillies, the caldinho is prepared using a generous amount of coconut milk. In another recipe, grated coconut is cooked till it turns into a paste.The principal ingredientbe it fish, or prawns, or vegetablesare added once the onion turns translucent, and the second press coconut milk extract follows soon after. The stew is then allowed to simmer till the ingredients are properly cooked and topped off with the first press coconut milk.The curry sauce is not spicy in the vegetarian caldinho either, but continues to be flavourful like its seafood counterpart. The caldinho goes well with traditional Goan rice or bread and is best served piping hot.""It is easy to cook and lends itself well to a variety of ingredients,"" says Sharma. ""While it might seem unlikely that a coastal state like Goa would have a vegetarian version of the caldinho, the long periods of abstinence from non-vegetarian food, practised by both Christian and Hindu communities has seen the dish evolve over time,"" he adds."

As many as 83 farmers in the district have registered for the cultivation of organic vegetables, which will be tested regularly along with the soil in their land. They have signed an undertaking to organically cultivate vegetables across one hectare each.Two years ago, Kerala's health department issued a notice to Tamil Nadu about the presence of high pesticide levels in its fruits and vegetables. They had even threatened to ban vegetables from Tamil Nadu. Since then, the state government has got into an overdrive to encourage production of organic vegetables and crops.The farmers spread across Pollachi, Annamalai North, Karamadai and Thondamuthur blocks, will cultivate any fruit or vegetable organically across one hectare of their land, said deputy director, horticulture, K Ramakrishnan . ""There are around 20 farmers in each of the four blocks. The blocks have been allotted a fund of Rs 7 lakh each for preparing organic pesticide and insecticides like Panchakavyam, collecting cow urine and neem oil,"" said the director. ""The farmers have to buy their own seeds and have agreed to have their produce, farms and soils tested regularly for the certification process,"" he said.To be on the safer side, a majority of the farmers chosen for the scheme are those who have already been trying to practice or practicing organic farming for at least two years.""For example, in Thondamuthur, a majority of the farmers who have enrolled are those with perennial crops like cocoa, areca nut, pepper, mangoes and even sapottaa. They are also ones with assured water supply from bores,"" said assistant director, horticulture, Thondamuthur, Vasanthi Gnanasekaran. ""None of them have registered for staple vegetables like tomato, onion, lady's finger, brinjal etc,"" she said.This is part of the central government scheme, Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana , to promote organic farming and certification of organic vegetables. ""Under this scheme, they not only get some funds to help prepare organic fertilizers and pesticides, but they also get exempted from having to pay the yearly fee of Rs 2,500 to get the organic inspection and certification,"" said Gnansekaran. The certification will be done by the regional council for Participatory Guarantee System for India (PGS), Mysore.The farmers are free to either form a co-operative and sell their produce to a wholesaler or director or even choose to export them."

However, due to perishable nature of fruits and vegetables and more dependency on climatic factor, many times these crops face either glut or shortage thereby affecting farmers as well as consumers.""The glut situations are observed in many crops like tomato, onion , potato as well as garlic which lead to heavy fluctuations in area and production in subsequent years. The seminar will focus on various issues related to the topic and formulate policies and strategies to avoid the problems faced by the farmers,"" said an official from NHRDF.The prices of vegetables are decided on the demand and supply ratio. Onion prices go up if demand is more as compared to supply and the prices crash if supply is huge as compared to the demand.The average wholesale onion prices have declined to the range of Rs 400 to Rs 500 in the past six months due to arrivals of onions in large quantity at the Agriculture Produce Market Committee markets. It costs Rs 1,000 for producing one quintal onion. Accordingly, farmers incur losses if the prices go below that. Hence, this workshop will help farmers understand the glut management for vegetables particularly onions.Divisional revenue commissioner Eknath Dawale will inaugurate the event."

Express Outside Raipurs indoor stadium on Monday.

The crowd surged as the vegetables were distributed outside Raipurs indoor stadium Monday. The road had to be cordoned off by police.As the crowd picked up tomatoes, then capsicum, and then green bananas, peals of laughter were heard. We cant believe we are getting 5 kg vegetables for free, said Sandhya Mandal, standing in the queue. The farmers laughed too, but there was irony in their laughter. The situation is so bad that we are giving our produce for free. We are in crisis, one farmer said.Watch what else is making news:Dharmesh Kumar Tank, a farmer from Rajnandgaon district and member of Chhattisgarh Yuva Pragatishil Kisan Sangh, said, This year, the price a farmer is getting for his produce is abysmally low. For vegetables it is between Rs 25 and 40 a crate, which contains 27-28 kg of produce. The price does not even cover the farmers transport costs.Several farmers told The Indian Express that there were several reasons for the dip in prices, but the irony was that they were being punished for a good season. After two years of bad rainfall, this year was excellent, and outputs were high. That is one of the reasons prices dropped. Middlemen in mandis drive up prices for consumers and eat into the margins of farmers, one farmer said. A lot of our produce, especially tomatoes, used to go to neighbouring countries like Pakistan, Nepal and Bhutan. Because of issues now, that has stopped, added Rohan Chawda, a farmer from Raipur and also from the Kisan Sangh.Several jokes were heard during the protest, many about demonetisation. Arre bhai, line me lagiye. Pachas din mein itna toh sikha hoga, they said.

While releasing the data for the full year with more than a quarter to go, the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) did give a disclaimer about not incorporating the impact of demonetisation in its projections about the countrys growth. The deceleration to 7.1% from 7.6% in the previous fiscal has come about on the back of considerations like global headwinds, retaining Indias status among the fastest-growing economies of the world. But such self-congratulatory report card carries no credibility when vast segments of the economy are in a state of disarray.In the initial days of the note-scrapping exercise, unprecedented anywhere on this scale, Indias micro-small industries reported 35% job losses and 50% dip in revenue, according to a study by the All India Manufacturers Organisation (AIMO). Job losses may go up to 60% and revenue loss to 55% before March 31, the AIMO study further projected. Certain vital sectors of the economy, which are among the largest employment generators, have come to a standstill even as they battle the image of being the parking lot for black money and corruption. Real estate and jewellery industries are almost shut, while tourism, infrastructure, automobile, media, fast-moving consumer goods, transportation, among others are in the grip of a slowdown. Agriculture sector and the entire rural landscape  which had a godly opportunity of rewarding farmers and farm workers, courtesy good monsoon  seem to be squandering away prospective gains as distress sales of onion, tomato, potato and several other crops are being reported from a large number of states following the note ban.The CSO may have managed to give flattering data by some technical and financial jugglery, but the GDP numbers without factoring in the impact of demonetisation are meaningless and are being taken so by the markets and independent analysts. The Finance Ministry, which is busy making the Budget to be presented a month ahead of the conventional last day of February, would do well not to rely too much on the CSO advance estimates while projecting the revenue and expenditure figures for the fiscal 2017-18. With Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley admitting visible impact of the invalidation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes on the economy, an ear to the ground policy would serve better."

The word immediately brings to mind juicy mangoes and family vacations. But with the soaring temperatures, the nasty bacteria and viruses decide to step up their activities as well. Flu, cough and cold, stomach upsets are some minor concerns that can strike anyone. The more serious ones are food and water borne infections like typhoid, cholera, gastroenteritis, food poisoning, and jaundice. Besides, the high amount of sweat gives rise to fungal and yeast infections on the skin.Nutrition will play an important role in beating these blues in summer. A healthy, balanced diet accompanied by regular exercise will do wonders for your health in the summer and beyond. Here are some tips on how to eat healthy during summers:Ban the unsafe foodsStay away from eating raw and cold foods while eating out, especially chutneys, salads, cut fruits, fruit juices or ice creams. While it is tempting to reach out to something cold and refreshing, these are highly likely to cause food borne infections when they are not stored in ambient temperatures. With frequent voltage or power breakdowns, the frozen foods tend to thaw and refreeze, which causes bacteria to multiply. Check the expiry date when buying ice creams and also look for uneven shape or bulges on the ice cream packaging. This could mean the ice cream has melted and again refrozen.HydrateSun burns, heat stroke and severe dehydration are some of the dangers in the scorching summers. The best remedy is to hydrate with clear fluids like plain water, tender coconut water, buttermilk, fresh homemade fruit or vegetable juices. Refrigerated water or other fluids may cause colds and coughs to those sensitive to sudden temperature changes. Using earthen pots to store water, or to set curds, buttermilk is a cool way of getting nourishing fluids in a safely cooled manner. Storing water in copper vessels is also a way of getting some copper ions and staying cool!Stay lightFried foods are heavy and can make you uncomfortable since it takes a long time to digest, and increases thirst. Replace these with shallow fried, grilled or baked foods lighter on your stomach and better for your health. Include a lot of raitas, gravies, and light watery vegetables like gourds, cucumber, melons, tomatoes that are rich in nutrients as well.Get your greensGreen leaves are loaded with vital nutrients including antioxidants, fiber, magnesium, zinc, iron and calcium. The leaves of drumstick, cauliflower, and radish are particularly high in these nutrients. Puree a cup of mixed greens and blend into your dal or roti to get a good dose of disease fighting nutrients.Load up on fruitsOne mango can give you the entire days requirements of Vitamin A! Other summery fruits are there for a reason too. Watermelon which is 80 per cent water, serves to hydrate and refresh, while giving you the necessary electrolytes lost in the sweat. Lychees, which can easily be called the queen of fruits in summers, and musk melon are rich sources of vitamin c that helps protect from colds and coughs.The author is a lead dietician from Manipal Hospitals."

Would you believe if I say it was a mess? (laughs) It started with the spices my parents bought from India. I was helping my sister, who was only a year older than me, to cut vegetables and marinate the meat with tomatoes and that was the fi rst time I smelled cumin and curry powder. I stepped into this fi eld when I was 14. During my summer holidays, I started working at a seafood restaurant to save up for a bike. When I started, I realised it was tough! I learned how to cut the fi sh and clean it before cooking. By the end of the summer, I bought my fi rst bike, and I decided not to give up cooking.Romani AgarwalI joined another restaurant the next summer, and worked with them full-time. For me, cooking is all about fusion. I fuse different cuisines. My one dish called the Tuna Tartar is a fusion of Italian and Asian cuisines. The sesame seeds used in the dish is predominant in Asian cuisines. The sauce is made of mayonnaise mixed with wasabi and horseradish and a little bit of lemon juice. I try to keep my food simple and traditional too at times. Getting to cook a simple traditional dish right is important. A chef should start fusion only when he has enough experience.I have noticed that cooking the simplest food is the most diffi cult. For instance, I have had pasta which was overcooked and smelled like oregano. Few main ingredients I always need in my kitchen are tomato pelati, extra-virgin olive oil (because its lighter), parmesan cheese, and parma ham. Having stayed in India for the past seven to eight years, I started using the herbs that I get here. I prefer using organic vegetables as it gives the food a genuine taste.I remember when we were young we used to steal tomatoes from trees and eat it raw. The taste of the tomatoes is still embedded in my mind that I try to fi nd that smell when I buy tomatoes for my kitchen. Cooking used to be a big task in my family. My mother and grandmother used to get up early in the morning to prepare. Even today, I try to rememeber the taste of their food and remake the dishes from my childhood. I love cooking for my family, but that happens only when I am in Italy. I cook with my brotherin- law who is also a chef. My wife is the queen of the kitchen there (laughs) she says that I make too much mess and wont let me cook."

He wrongly thought that it was a done deal. It's not a done deal.""Le Pen herself joined the bashing, saying ""all French people saw that he had the feeling he'd already won. It's not very respectful of democracy, of the voters"".Reprising her depiction of Macron as a product of the elite, she said he had celebrated with the ""arrogant caste that thinks... it can do anything it wants with the country.""Turbo-chargedSince securing her berth in the runoff, Le Pen has turbo-charged her campaign with a string of appearances and statements, leaving her opponent on the back foot.At the crack of dawn on Tuesday she was at the sprawling Rungis food market outside Paris, taking aim at what she said was Macron's desire for ""total deregulation, total opening up, total free trade"".In contrast, her opponent has huddled in strategy meetings over June legislative elections that will determine the shape of a future Macron government.Polls suggest that Macron will trounce Le Pen in the runoff with a margin of some 20 points.But after the political shocks of Britain's vote to leave the European Union and Donald Trump's unlikely ascent to the White House, analysts say a late surge by Le Pen is still possible.Macron has his work cut out to give people ""positive reasons"" to vote for him, said Guillaume Goubert, editor of the daily La Croix, noting that many voters had chosen him in the first round out of a desire to block other candidates rather than out of any real fervour.Le Pen says she is the only candidate for change in a deeply divided country burdened by high unemployment and inequality.""Nothing in either Mr Macron's policies or his behaviour suggests the slightest proof of his love for France,"" she said on Monday. ""We are going to win.""The candidate had a mixed reception at Rungis, where she drew boos -- and ducked a flying tomato -- over a pledge to deport all illegal immigrants.""We're workers too. We pay our taxes,"" a fruit vendor shouted. ""It's a disgrace,"" another said repeatedly.Also Monday, Le Pen said she was quitting temporarily as head of her National Front (FN) party in order to concentrate on the campaign.The move was seen as largely symbolic but one that would loosen her association with the FN, the party founded by Le Pen's father, Jean-Marie, notorious for anti-Semitic and xenophobic remarks.Homage to slain policemanEarlier Tuesday, the rival candidates attended a sombre ceremony honouring a policeman killed on the Champs-Elysees last week.Macron and Le Pen stood grim-faced among hundreds of mourners as Xavier Jugele's gay partner delivered a moving eulogy to the 37-year-old officer, whose shooting was claimed by the Islamic State group.""I suffer without hatred,"" Etienne Cardiles said at the ceremony led by Hollande at Paris police headquarters.Cardiles was echoing the sentiment of the husband of a victim of the November 2015 jihadist attack on Paris's Bataclan concert hall who said to the perpetrators: ""You won't have my hatred.""Macron and Le Pen differ starkly on how to protect France, still reeling from a string of jihadist attacks since 2015 that has claimed more than 230 lives.Le Pen has called for France to take back control of its borders from the European Union and deport all foreigners on a terror watchlist, accusing Macron of being soft on terrorism.Macron has urged voters not to ""give in to fear"" and vowed to step up security cooperation with EU partners.Analysts say that alongside security, the economy will likely dominate a critical TV debate between the two candidates on May 3."
5922be767be9e01fceefaa9a,"Devotees get cake, burger prasadam",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/607727/devotees-get-cake-burger-prasadam.html,2017-04-22,,Deccan Herald,"Devotees get cake, burger prasadamR Sathyanarayana in Chennai, Apr 22 2017, 23:41 ISTTamil Nadu temple is breaking barriersPrasadam being served to devotees.Temple has installed prasadam vending machinesFamous Venkateswara temple at Tirumala in Andhra Pradesh is known for its laddu prasadam. Similarly, Murgan temple at Palani in Tamil Nadu is famous for its Panchamirtham. Most of the temples across the country serve traditional food as prasadam.However, the traditional prasadams such as laddu, jaggery rice and dhal pongal have become pass at a temple on the outskirts of Chennai. The Jaya Durga Peetam temple at Padappai serves burgers and brownies along with mineral water to devotees. The temple, spread over one acre, is in Oragadam taluk, about 40 km from Chennai.The stylish western type prasadam also includes cakes (without egg), sandwiches, vegetable cutlets, tomato salads and phulkas and they are neatly packed. The temple also offers health drinks, including badam milk.The food is cooked or baked in the temple kitchen, which is certified by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India. The temple also has a well-maintained dining hall. The prasadam, served free of charge, carries manufacturing and best before dates on every packet.The service is also hi-tech. Devotees can collect boxes of prasadam from vending machine installed at the temple's automated kitchen. The prasadam is a big hit not only among locals but also among devotees from different places.One man who has made all these possible is Dr K Sri Sridar, a herbal oncologist. Sridar, who established the temple, says that the worship place was like other temples in the beginning. However, he wanted to make the temple formalities little different not only for offering hygienic prasadam but also for attracting children to worship god.The kumbabishekam for the temple was performed in 1996. At that time it was like any other temple. When I noticed that priests were serving prasadam by hands, I thought it was unhygienic. Then, I decided to change it in my temple, Sridar said.To start with Jaya Durga Peetam temple offered hygienic packed food, including rotis, dal and mixed rice regularly. Later, I thought why not introduce burger and other attractive food items. I elicited the opinions of several people and the response was positive, Sridar said.But, when I started serving cakes and burgers as prasadam, I faced stiff opposition from some temples as they felt my act is against the temple practices as prescribed in the Hindu religion. However, I ignored them and went ahead with my initiative, which attracted several children. The opposition slowly died down, he said.We ensure that prasadam is not repeated in the week. However, burger, cakes, sandwich and brownies are severed only on Saturdays and Sundays so that children and students can come to the temple not only to worship but also for the prasadam, Sridar said.After performing pooja, every devotee will be given a token to get prasadam through the vending machine. Sridar was not satisfied with the introduction of attractive prasadams. He felt that the devotees should get clean drinking water also. I have made sure that every devotee gets 500 ml clean water to quench their thirst after they enter the temple, he said.The temple, which runs through donations, opens at 6 am and closes at 12 noon. In the evenings, darshan will be between 4 pm and 8 pm. Another uniqueness is that the temple has no hundi (cash collection box) on the temple premises. Even the priests will not receive any offerings from the devotees for conducting poojas, Sridar said.He said that by the grace of god they have not faced dearth of people coming to sponsor the day's expenses. On occasions, devotees donate for food and flowers for one week. We will pick the bill if no devotee comes forward to sponsor the day's pooja and prasadam. Daily, about 100 devotees offer pooja at the temple. On special occasions, the figure touches 1,000, Sridar added. However, he declined to disclose the amount donors will have to pay for the daily service.Explaining functioning of the temple, Sridar said, We purchase items required for a particular day and expenses are borne by donors. The payment is directly made to the shop, Sridar said.Not only with prasadam, the temple is slightly hi-tech in welcoming the devotees. Keeping with changed times, the devotees will have to register their names and provide their mobile numbers. They are welcomed by the temple authorities through SMSes. The devotees also get regular alerts on the important poojas and rituals that are to be performed in the temple on auspicious days.The temple's doors are open for celebrating events like birthdays. They are allowed to cut the cake and blow candles. Recently 82-year-old Subbulakshmi, who had never celebrated her birthday, came to the temple with her children and cut a big cake.As a doctor, Sridar says that elderly people, who want to perform ""Angapradhashanam"" (rolling on the floor around the temple) should check their blood pressure before performing it. Besides me, lab technicians will be in the temple to check the BP of old people. If the devotees are not fit, we will not allow them to perform Angapradhashanam, he said.The temple has already banned use of camphor and plastic inside the premises. The management provides hair driers for devotees taking head bath before doing Angapradhashanam.In the next phase of improvement, the temple management is planning smart card system for the devotees to enable them to open the door and enter the temple. Many ATM kiosks have adopted the same."

The whole country is exposed to nematode infestation, he said, adding that a high level committee can be set up to find solutions to the issue.The AICRP  Nematodes is working to create awareness on nematodes.

5922c12d7be9e01fe6dfa4bf,Things to know before going organic,http://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/2017/mar/18/things-to-know-before-going-organic-1582576.html,2017-03-18,,The New Indian Express,"Organic food, organic fabrics, organic Holi colors?! The market is abuzz with products fashionably advertised as organic  from daily consumables like shampoos and soaps to offbeat designer clothes! The word organic is ad nauseam and some products slyly pass off as inherently good just because they are simply tagged so. Now, here is the dilemma when buying. How much organic is too organic; because organic products usually cost more.It seems people world over are leading robust lives and eating healthy; but they are unwittingly ingesting insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, rodenticides, molluscicides, nematicides, plant growth regulators among others. There is way too much chemicals in food chains than is good. These compounds synthesised artificially to boost productivity in modern scientific farms are ALL toxic. Crop yields have increased dramatically but unscrupulous practices have left behind a lethal cocktail of dangerous compounds. They are an inseparable part of common lifestyles, food preferences and diets. Many studies link pesticides in foods with various ailments without doubt, from IQ loss to cancer! It is now an obvious no brainier to prefer nutritious and safe organic foods for long-term wellness.Many plant-based foods are industrially produced with genetically modified technologies or retailed with high residual pesticides. Based on the 2015 Report of the Environmental Working Group (EWG), an O-List (Organic Must Buy List!) was published. These are highly recommended edibles that should be bought organic even if they dent monthly food budgets. Here are some pointers that will make extra spend on organic alternates worthwhile at the grocers.Fruits with thin skins like apples, peaches, pears, grapes and strawberries are all on the O-List. Research publications show that 99% of apples contain at least one residual pesticide ... and 15 different types of pesticides are typically found on grapes.When it comes to veggies, the dirtiest are potatoes and spinach. It seems definitely worthwhile to go organic on these household staples. Also on the veggie O-list are ladies finger, tomatoes, cucumber, corn, capsicum and most other leafy greens.Dairy products like milk, cheese and yogurt rank high on the O-list. Certified organic dairy products are from cows and buffaloes reared entirely on organic feeds without antibiotics or growth hormones. Non-vegetarians must beware that conventional meat contains all these deadly chemicals in good measure. After all most cows, chicken, and other animals are reared with additives to spur meat production in commercial enterprises intent to maximise returns on investment.It seems only fair to counter the O-list with a clean-list of foods where it is just fine and safe to buy conventional such as bananas, which have a thick skin. Others include watermelon, pineapple, papaya, musk melon, mangoes and kiwi. Vegetables like drumsticks, onions, cauliflower, cabbage (red/white or purple), brinjal, peas, pumpkin, gourds, mushrooms and sweet potatoes find mention here. Amongst the less common vegetables included in the clean list are avocadoes and asparagus.So there we have it folks: O-list vs clean-list! Choose smartly and keep your wallet happy!"

His village of Kannamoochi lies a few kilometres from Mettur Dams reservoir. This is where Cauvery comes to after a run across the plains of Dharmapuri district. Coursing along the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border, it tumbles over Hogenakkal Falls and is captured by Stanley Reservoir in Salem district.It used to be a majestic reservoir, created in 1934 during the construction of Mettur Dam, now the subject of more litigation than irrigation. Now its a memory for most of the year.Seven of Thavasi Rajs nine borewells are dry. Whose arent in this summer of discontent? But this is the flood plain of Cauvery, and the depth of his two functional borewells indicate how deep the river has sank. One is 1,100ft and the other 900ft, reports Thavasi. The speed of water from the second one has gone down, and Im scared itll stop working soon.Thavasi is lucky to have any water at all. Smaller farmers cant afford to burrow so deep. Im just lucky because there is still some ground water left in Kannamoochi, he says.Salem is big on horticulture. Orchards occupy roughly 25 percent of all cultivable land: chillies, turmeric, plantain, tapioca, areca nut, tomatoes and other vegetables. The famous Salem mangoes are grown in Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri.This year, inflorescence was promising in January, but never came. Now farmer R Venkatachalam of Vanavasi village is showing us the fruit of his labour. Its a tiny Kiimooku that fits into the pit of his palm. Kiimookus grow to 300gm, but this one is 100gm.Venkatachalam and his brother Raju R struggled all spring to irrigate the 600 trees they have in their 10-acre orchard. They bought dozens of 5,000-litre tankerloads, each for Rs 600-700. But the deliveries were never prompt. Other farmers needed water too.In the village, another farmer, P Kasigounder, reels off his losses: 25 percent in 2015, 50 percent in 2016 and 85 percent this summer. I lost Rs 3 lakh, says Kasigounder. The kind government offered Rs 5,900 as drought relief.Further off from the Mettur Dam, we stop at the field of Selvaraj R in Kolathur. Its barely 8km from Stanley, but his chilli field is cinder-dry with his cattle scrounging for tufts of grass. A chilli field beyond him has been baked bronze. Selvaraj plucks a pepper and holds it up by the stalk like a scientist would a lab rat. How will anybody buy this! he sighs.Kolathur chillis are known for their kick on the palate. They are the flavourful condiment vathal milagai you get with South Indian food. The local trick is to allow the chillies to ripen and dry in the field and take them straight to the shandy (market). This year, the pods didnt stand a chance.The Kolathur chilli crop yields five or six harvests in 15-day intervals during the February-May period. This year, farmers lost 80-90 percent of it. The crop withered even before the first harvest.The February-March period was a desperate time in horticulture villages like Thalaivasal. One farmer, P Kalayarasan, said he struggled to keep his crop alive as his only borewell began to die. We spent Rs 25,000 to save our chilli field. It was of no use, he said. Now we dont have water for cattle.Some five per cent of the crop made it to the market in the Thalaivasal block this year. With time on his hands, Kalayarasan remembers the good times: During peak seasons, we used to bring chillies to the shandy in 10-15 bicycles and sold it at Rs 150 per kg. It wasnt only short-duration crops like chilli that didnt survive. Coconut and areca nut groves gave horticulturists as much grief.Areca begins yielding in three years and lives up to 35. But 65 percent of the trees died in Salem district this year. Farmer Pandian P said that 2015 hadnt been a good year either, but his two borewells saved him. In 2017, both gave up.How some beat the droughtDrip, drip, dripAmidst the vast expanse of dry fields in Kannampoochi village, one tiny field of plantain, belonging to farmer Thavasi, looked like it had a tinge of green. At the foot of the boles, a black pipe snakes along the ridges on which the plantain saplings grow. Drip irrigation trickled into Salem about a decade ago and it is gaining popularity given that drought has blighted the region.This year, Thavasi has made a profit because, although banana production fell due to drought, the drip saved his crop. If a well irrigates one acre of land, a drip takes care of two-three acres, he says. I dont think I would have had a crop without it.The districts horticulture department offers a total subsidy to small farmers (those owning less than 5 acres) and a 75 per cent subsidy to big farmers. However, drip irrigations popularity is restricted to plantains and tapioca. It has not spread to other crops.Plastic mulchAnother new technique used by vegetable and tapioca farmers is plastic mulch  a long sheet of plastic with several circular holes in it. Several acres of vegetables are grown in these holes. These mulches reduce evaporation, control growth of weed and can be re-used for a second harvest, a horticulture official says. Between 2014 and 2016 over 100 hectares of land were mulched in Salem. This technique is applied alongside drip irrigation.Pitcher irrigationPitcher irrigation is another strategy implemented in some parts of the district. An earthen pot with a lid on top and holes at the bottom is buried in the soil. Crops, particularly vegetables, are sown around the pitcher. This ensures water does not evaporate and reaches only the roots. But the technique is less popular than mulching.Go tapiocaTapioca is used for making sago and starch. Salem contributes to about one-third of all sago produced in India. Although tapioca is drought-resistant, its cultivation has gone down by half, according to the horticulture department. If tapioca gets affected by a drought, chances are that the situation is very severe, a senior official said."

And there, at the hotel we were staying in, was a little restaurant. A neat space, well decorated and with an air of cheery hospitality. The temple was a stones throw away, the days were bright and sunny, and the food was good.Its at the little places that one meets the most surprising and delightful people. Here it was an elderly, genial man, always smiling. He wasnt around in the daytime it seemed, because I didnt see him then. After a visit to the temple one evening, we found ourselves back at the restaurant for dinner.It was a pleasant time, right after the sun had set, and not too deep into the night. When someone asked for an order of fried rice, he looked doubtful. Itll be too much for one person, he said, guessing that the others would want to eat something else. Therell be a lot left over, he added, and the fried rice, on his suggestion, was replaced with a masala dosa. Of that he approved, because the portion was just right. Moreover, the dosa was crisp, filled with tomatoes and potatoes, an unusual dosa, drizzled with ghee.I know these things, he remarked cheerfully. When youve worked at restaurants as long as I have, you just know what someone would like. You look at people, and you can guess what theyd want to eat. I knew, he added with a grin, that youd order fried rice, that itll be too much, and then youll order a dosa instead. All this was said in warm good humour. He left us to our meal, but came back once or twice to ask about the food. He offered more sambar, filling up our katoris, and knew exactly when the katoris might be empty or full. After the meal, we were wondering what to drink. Have a Horlicks, in hot milk, he suggested. It goes really very well with the dosa. Naturally, thats what was ordered. After the meal, we told him the food was delicious (which it was), and he was delighted. And through it all, he continued to smile.In a world that is short on courtesy, and where curt responses are more common than they should be, folks like him are rare indeedfolks who have experience in their work and remain cheerful, well-mannered and considerate towards those they meet. Amidst the chaos, theres something refreshing about those who speak optimistically, and thoughtfullythose who may have their own problems, and who doesnt, after all, and still smile. Most of all, individuals such as these, remarkable in their own way, unknown to the larger world perhaps but remembered by those who meet themthese are the people who make life just a little brighter, just a little happier, a little sunnier.Email: suryakantham3@yahoo.com"

Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidus vision is to make the State a horticulture hub and increase the net area sown by horticulture crops from the 20% to 35% in the next three years.The benefits of fertigation over the conventional or drop-fertilizing methods include increased nutrient absorption, reduction of fertilizer and water needed and greater control in the application of nutrients.There is a reduction in soil erosion because the nutrients are pumped through the water drip system. Leaching of nutrients from the soil is also decreased.The government is going to promote innovative technologies like off-season, protected cultivation of vegetables and flowers in poly houses and shade net houses, pandal system of vegetable cultivation, using of trellis for tomato cultivation to increase yield and mulching for gourds and melons to increase production and net-returns for farmers.As many as 6.25 lakh farmers micro-irrigating crops are benefiting from various schemes under the A.P. Micro Irrigation Project (APMIP), according to the Planning Department.Net returnAccording to a third party evaluation of the impact of micro irrigation on the net returns to farmers conducted by the NABCONS Consultancy Services and Agriculture Finance Corporation (AFC), there has been a minimum of 25% increase in net income per hectare due to micro-irrigation.Mango showed the highest increase of 50% on net income including the saving on water and energy. The following are the crops and the percentage increase in net return on income due to the impact of micro irrigation: mango 50%, sweet orange 27%, acid lime 25%, guava 25%, banana 42 %, papaya 27%, vegetables 40%, tomato 39%, maize 22% and mulberry 40 %.The State government is implementing strategies to make Rayalaseema as a horticulture hub.The government has set for itself a target of covering 10 lakh farmers in the next three years under the Farmer Producer Organisations (FPO) for agriculture and allied sectors for the formation of linkages to market the States products, globally."

5922c3ea7be9e01fe6dfa84b,Doubling our farm incomes,http://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/2017/mar/25/doubling-our-farm-incomes-1585549.html,2017-03-25,,The New Indian Express,"Last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the governments goal of doubling the farmers income by 2022. Simple math tells us that this would require the farmers income to rise by around 12 per cent per year on average, over the next five years. This is in nominal terms, i.e. not adjusted for inflation. Its an audacious goal if you consider the fact that agriculture growth (in real terms) has never averaged more than five per cent over any continuous five-year period, in recent history. Thats because of two reasons.Firstly, agricultural productivity cannot rise steeply year after year, and secondly the area under cultivation cannot expand rapidly and continuously. Modest increase is possible, but not exponential. Besides, prices may remain stable, denying any nominal rupee gains. In addition to all this are the risks associated with agriculture, which are monsoon failure, pest attacks, spurious seeds, adverse weather shocks, etc., all of which contribute to making the goal truly audacious.But if you read the Prime Ministers goal carefully, you will notice that it is to double the farmers income, not agricultural production per se. Hence it is possible that the farmer may have some non-agricultural sources of income. Indeed, the services sector activities in rural areas have been increasing substantially, providing livelihoods to many. But more importantly, what if we increased the share of the overall national income pie that accrues to the farmer? It is this approach that holds the greatest promise of increasing incomes to the farmer.There are two aspects to the incomes associated with the food and cash crop economies. First, in case of fruits and vegetables, the difference between what the city dweller pays for the tomatoes, and what the farmer actually receives is huge. City folk pay four times the cost, attributable to reasons like transport, losses, entry taxes and fat margins for middlemen. If some of these inefficiencies are removed, a larger share can go to the farmer. The dismantling of the provisions of the Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act in many states is ensuring the reduction of this gap. So also is the establishment of electronic national agriculture market. Any mechanism to connect buyers and sellers directly can benefit the farmer, as long as he retains some bargaining power.The other aspect of increasing income share to farmers, is through value added agriculture, namely agro-processing. This has immense potential. The groundnut may fetch only forty rupees a kilo to the farmer, but when it becomes masala coated peanuts in a fancy packaging, it fetches four hundred rupees a kilo. The same is true for oranges and orange juice, or bananas and banana chips. There is almost an infinite range of agro-processing products possible, which can retain freshness, flavour and taste of produce, through a combination of technologies like nitrogen or vacuum packing, or freeze-drying.Some of the products that have become very popular in a short time are wet idli mix, instant upma and noodles, fresh juices including pomegranate and lychees, jowar chips and so on. All of these products require investment, working capital, marketing, advertising and efficient distribution. The growth of conventional consumer food companies is an indication of the great potential. But the trick is to ensure that farmers garner a proportionate share of the increase in and income that comes from agro-processing.This is where the farmer producer organisations (FPOs) come in. These are hybrid organisations combining features of a shareholder-owned company and cooperatives. The FPO structure was formally introduced under Company Law, to enable farmers to become shareholders. This ensures they have clout and bargaining power when dealing with consumers, small or big (such as organised retail supermarket chains). If a farmer sells groundnuts to a buyer, then no sales tax, VAT or now GST is applicable. But if an FPO sells salted peanut packets then all kinds of taxes become applicable. This defeats the economic viability since profit margins are slim and overheads can be large, especially when the scale is small. It is here that policy intervention is needed to ensure healthy growth of FPOs around the country.Not all crops and agri-products are amenable to be produced within an FPO structure. The success of FPOs depends also on them holding their own against FMCG companies, assessing consumer tastes and preferences, ensuring quality and offering competitive pricing. But because the demand is so large, those FPOs that manage these challenges well are bound to increase the incomes of their shareholders, i.e. farmers, immensely.For far too long the farm sector was neglected or has suffered from muddled policies and inefficient implementation. By making the goal of doubling farmers income in five years, the PM has brought the right focus to the problem. In addition, well need investment in irrigation, better water management (another of the PMs slogan, more crop per drop), dismantling APMC-like shackles, more seamless connect between buyer and seller and proactive policies for FPOs to flourish.A good monsoon last year ensured that agriculture growth would be close to nine percent in the second half this fiscal. Some states like Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are reporting even higher, double-digit growth rates. Sub sectors like horticulture, dairy, livestock, show promise of high growth in incomes. While conventional policy push should continue and strengthen, we also need a push to ensure the profits from agroprocessing go predominantly to the farmer. Thats the only way to reach the goal of doubling his income.(Syndicate: The Billion press)Ajit RanadeSenior economist based in MumbaiEmail: editor@thebillionpress.org"

His village of Kannamoochi lies a few kilometres from Mettur Dams reservoir. This is where Cauvery comes to after a run across the plains of Dharmapuri district. Coursing along the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border, it tumbles over Hogenakkal Falls and is captured by Stanley Reservoir in Salem district.It used to be a majestic reservoir, created in 1934 during the construction of Mettur Dam, now the subject of more litigation than irrigation. Now its a memory for most of the year.Seven of Thavasi Rajs nine borewells are dry. Whose arent in this summer of discontent? But this is the flood plain of Cauvery, and the depth of his two functional borewells indicate how deep the river has sank. One is 1,100ft and the other 900ft, reports Thavasi. The speed of water from the second one has gone down, and Im scared itll stop working soon.Thavasi is lucky to have any water at all. Smaller farmers cant afford to burrow so deep. Im just lucky because there is still some ground water left in Kannamoochi, he says.Salem is big on horticulture. Orchards occupy roughly 25 percent of all cultivable land: chillies, turmeric, plantain, tapioca, areca nut, tomatoes and other vegetables. The famous Salem mangoes are grown in Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri.This year, inflorescence was promising in January, but never came. Now farmer R Venkatachalam of Vanavasi village is showing us the fruit of his labour. Its a tiny Kiimooku that fits into the pit of his palm. Kiimookus grow to 300gm, but this one is 100gm.Venkatachalam and his brother Raju R struggled all spring to irrigate the 600 trees they have in their 10-acre orchard. They bought dozens of 5,000-litre tankerloads, each for Rs 600-700. But the deliveries were never prompt. Other farmers needed water too.In the village, another farmer, P Kasigounder, reels off his losses: 25 percent in 2015, 50 percent in 2016 and 85 percent this summer. I lost Rs 3 lakh, says Kasigounder. The kind government offered Rs 5,900 as drought relief.Further off from the Mettur Dam, we stop at the field of Selvaraj R in Kolathur. Its barely 8km from Stanley, but his chilli field is cinder-dry with his cattle scrounging for tufts of grass. A chilli field beyond him has been baked bronze. Selvaraj plucks a pepper and holds it up by the stalk like a scientist would a lab rat. How will anybody buy this! he sighs.Kolathur chillis are known for their kick on the palate. They are the flavourful condiment vathal milagai you get with South Indian food. The local trick is to allow the chillies to ripen and dry in the field and take them straight to the shandy (market). This year, the pods didnt stand a chance.The Kolathur chilli crop yields five or six harvests in 15-day intervals during the February-May period. This year, farmers lost 80-90 percent of it. The crop withered even before the first harvest.The February-March period was a desperate time in horticulture villages like Thalaivasal. One farmer, P Kalayarasan, said he struggled to keep his crop alive as his only borewell began to die. We spent Rs 25,000 to save our chilli field. It was of no use, he said. Now we dont have water for cattle.Some five per cent of the crop made it to the market in the Thalaivasal block this year. With time on his hands, Kalayarasan remembers the good times: During peak seasons, we used to bring chillies to the shandy in 10-15 bicycles and sold it at Rs 150 per kg. It wasnt only short-duration crops like chilli that didnt survive. Coconut and areca nut groves gave horticulturists as much grief.Areca begins yielding in three years and lives up to 35. But 65 percent of the trees died in Salem district this year. Farmer Pandian P said that 2015 hadnt been a good year either, but his two borewells saved him. In 2017, both gave up.How some beat the droughtDrip, drip, dripAmidst the vast expanse of dry fields in Kannampoochi village, one tiny field of plantain, belonging to farmer Thavasi, looked like it had a tinge of green. At the foot of the boles, a black pipe snakes along the ridges on which the plantain saplings grow. Drip irrigation trickled into Salem about a decade ago and it is gaining popularity given that drought has blighted the region.This year, Thavasi has made a profit because, although banana production fell due to drought, the drip saved his crop. If a well irrigates one acre of land, a drip takes care of two-three acres, he says. I dont think I would have had a crop without it.The districts horticulture department offers a total subsidy to small farmers (those owning less than 5 acres) and a 75 per cent subsidy to big farmers. However, drip irrigations popularity is restricted to plantains and tapioca. It has not spread to other crops.Plastic mulchAnother new technique used by vegetable and tapioca farmers is plastic mulch  a long sheet of plastic with several circular holes in it. Several acres of vegetables are grown in these holes. These mulches reduce evaporation, control growth of weed and can be re-used for a second harvest, a horticulture official says. Between 2014 and 2016 over 100 hectares of land were mulched in Salem. This technique is applied alongside drip irrigation.Pitcher irrigationPitcher irrigation is another strategy implemented in some parts of the district. An earthen pot with a lid on top and holes at the bottom is buried in the soil. Crops, particularly vegetables, are sown around the pitcher. This ensures water does not evaporate and reaches only the roots. But the technique is less popular than mulching.Go tapiocaTapioca is used for making sago and starch. Salem contributes to about one-third of all sago produced in India. Although tapioca is drought-resistant, its cultivation has gone down by half, according to the horticulture department. If tapioca gets affected by a drought, chances are that the situation is very severe, a senior official said."

Beans, broccoli, blueberries, salmon, spinach, tomatoes, kale, walnuts and yogurt are some of the chief ingredients that make up most of the dishes.The diner has definietly stepped up the game in terms of healthy food and has gone beyond the regular salad to please the fitness concious and the foodies alike. The menu features appetizers, entrees, sides and desserts. We started off with the Fruits and Nuts Super Salad. The salad offers the crispness of te romaine lettuce, spinach, red cabbage and broccoli along with the crunch and sweetness of the walnuts, apples, dried apricots, cranberries and blueberries. While, I have always been skeptical of salads, this one definitely made me rethink.I would any day prefer binging on this good looking salad that tastes beautiful with the crisp and crunch of green and nuts, seasoned with a pomegranate honey mustard vinaigrette.Try the Pomegranate Honey Mustard Salmon. The lemon and olive oil basted grilled salmon filet is grilled just right with a crisp top and a very well cooked meat inside. The fish is topped with pomegranate honey mustard vinaigrette. The dish is mildly sweet, served with couscous and ginner kale along with with toasted almond, cranberry and blueberry.This one will win your heart with the saltiness of the fish and the sweetness of the dressing. The Cherry Chipotle BBQ Chicken too is cooked very well. The grilled chicked breast is flavoured with lemon and olive oil and is topped with tangy cherry chipotle BBQ sauce. It is served with an apple five-grain pilaf and fresh broccoli slaw.If you are a vegetarian, dealing with an itchy throat or just having a bad day in general, ask for the Vegetarian Tex Mex Chili, like I did. The dish just fills you up with warmness and the tanginess of the sun-ripened tomatoes along with the substance of the beans.Like the name suggests, this is truly a Tex Mex wholesome meal made with chipotle peppers, red onions topped with yogurt, fresh pico de galloand jalapeno. The dish is served hot and spicy on a brown rice pilaf. We ended our meal with the Fruit Crumble dessert. Do I love sweet and sour blended in with loads of crunchy crumble? Hell yeah! The dessert is heavy on the sour side, but I have always enjoyed citrus flavours, so I had a gala time devouring this delicious baby.While scaling high on the flavours, the dessert will also appeal to those watching their calories. The crumble is packed with strawberries, blackberries, blueberries and juicy peaches and served hot with a topping of vanilla frozen yogurt scoop.I would highly recommend foodies and the health concious to go check out this new menu.Cost for two: `2,500 (approx)"

It includes sustainable food that is made out of locally sourced ingredients. They use deep sea fish and their chicken is claimed to be antibiotic and artificial hormone free. While today several restaurants in the city boasts of offering healthy food on their menu, Fava claims to be one of the very few that aims for ethical food.The Polenta Crusted Crispy Goat Cheese and Thyme Roll is crunchy on the outside and its insides melt as soon as you take a bite. It is served with a spiced tomato relish. The Plated Smoked Salmon Labneh is cooked very well and has subtle flavours of capers, dill and paprika ruling the palate. The Grilled Deep Sea Prawn with Black Sesame too is cooked right and has the smoky flavour of the prawn that blends well with chilli, garlic and extra virgin olive oil seasoning. In the Plated Mezze and Salad category, I absolutely fell in love with Father Michaels Valombrossa Burrata.If there was one word I could use to describe it, then it would be beautiful. The dish is a maple tree farm organic beetroot mezze with dukkah and popped amaranth. The Melon, Watermelon & Feta Salad is what you call basic done right. The dish is simple and lets the fruits and the feta take a centrestage with its natural flavours, which by the way are absolutely fresh tasting. The dish is tempered with pomegranate, mint, arugula, balsamic reduction and extra virgin olive oil. Among pizzas, I tried the multi grain vegetarian Funghi Misti pizza. It tastes fresh out of the oven with toppings of corn, jalapeno, bell pepper, onion and mozzarella.In the main course, I would highly recommend the Mediterranean Style Stir-fry with Millet & Black Rice Risotto. The dish is warm, tastes fresh and healthy thanks to the locally sourced grains that take the stage to recreate an Italian Classic with organic vegetables. Among the non vegetarian dishes, the Signature Pomegranate Chicken is a must have. The chicken is very well cooked with the subtle pomegranate flavour. It is served with chargrilled vegetables and parsley-arugula vichyssoise. At Fava, the kitchen uses Earth Loaf chocolates made from Indian cacao beans. The chocolates are made in Mysuru.If you are in the mood to experiment, try Favas homemade liquid nitrogen infused 100% natural ice cream, sorbet and frozen yoghurt with topping. I had it in caramel popcorn. The ice cream is super smooth and has a strong caramel flavour. It was topped with a few caramel popcorn. My favourite, however, is the Duet of Chocolate Fondant . It has the chocolate crunch, with a gooey foundant that oozes when you dip in your spoon. It is a play on hot and cold chocolate flavours. Do give this one a try.Among cocktails, I tried the liquid nitrogen infused house special Cocktails including Fava Martini, Pink Bramble and Morgan Colada. I particularly enjoyed the Fava Martini that had a good punch of gin that blends well with cranberry juice, gingerm blue curacao, grenadine and fresh lime.Morgan Colada too was an interesting combination, especially for Captain Morgan rum fans. This cocktail has spiced rum mixed with pineapple juice and coconut milk. Other than these, the Tiramisu cocktail too was an interesting spin on the dessert. It has tequila, Baileys mascarpone and espresso. Id say if you are ending your meall with a drink, let it be Tiramisu.Cost for two: `1,900 (approx.)"

Drought has worsened the situation further this time."

At the worst, traders say the prices may continue to soar for at least the next two months when supplies are expected to improve.Prices of vegetables like bean, carrot and brinjal have increased, forcing buyers to be economical with their purchase. While bean is the most expensive, carrot is selling for Rs 60-70 per kg. Even beetroot, which was selling for Rs 20 per kg is now selling at double the rate.Ladies finger, sold at Rs 20 per kg, has also gone up to Rs 30 per kg. Even broad bean (avarakkai in Tamil) is now being sold at Rs 60-70 per kg.The prices may continue to stay this way until July when the yield from the fresh crop is expected to arrive in the market, said S Chandran, president, Koyambedu Vegetable Wholesale Merchants Association.Although the prices of tomato and onion are currently low, Chandran feels those could also go up soon. Tomato is selling at Rs 10 per kg while onion costs Rs 15 per kg at the retail market in Koyambedu.Chandran says the supply of vegetables has reduced. On any given day, around 450 to 500 trucks supply vegetables to Koyambedu Market but for the last couple of weeks the supply has reduced to 350 trucks, he said.The demand for vegetables is more as it is an auspicious month. We even expect the prices of tomato to double in the next 10 to 15 days, Abdul Kader, secretary, Koyambedu Vegetable Wholesale Merchants Association, told Express.Even the price of coriander, which is in huge demand due to rise in temperature, is Rs 15-20 per kg.

She is in her early 60s and her family has been doing the laundry for 15 families for generations. As is the tradition for rural dhobis, she is paid at wedding time in cash and new clothes. Or she is paid in paddy every year, 50 seru (one seru is a little over a kg) per person in her household.Hulligeammas life depends on water. She makes a living from it and gets paid in produce that needs it. So the current drought has hit her harder and Hulligeamma is crying hoarse about it.Rajoli is a village in the drought-prone district of Raichur (rainfall less than 650 mm) in Karnataka. It has seen six consecutive seasons of deficient rainfall. In the past monsoon year, two cycles of rain (the southwest monsoon from June to September and the northeast from October to December) were short by 15 per cent and 71 per cent respectively in Karnataka.Farmers in Rajoli suffered losses on their cotton crop last season with high temperatures causing a pink bollworm attack, and switched to red chilli. But too many people planted chilli and prices crashed this year.It was a bitter harvest. Standing chilli crops have been burnt to avoid the reaping expenses. Many fields are dotted with abandoned heaps of chilli, like hot blisters.With little money to go around and barely enough water, tempers are short and generosity scarce.All of Rajolis drinking water sources have dried up and its people have to go to a tap in Irapuram village, 3 km away. Hulligeamma says, You will have to go without drinking water if you dont have a two-wheeler.The gram panchayat has tried to ease the villagers hardship by renting a tap from a farmer for Rs 8,000 a month but it rarely serves all the families.There are 11 people in Hulligeammas family: three sons, three daughters-in-law, three grandchildren, Hulligeamma and her paralysed husband. Her youngest son brings drinking water, four pots every two days, for the entire family on a borrowed motorcycle.He gets up at 6 am and spends an hour at the tap, she says. Often there are people from Irapuram too. Then he has to wait till they are done, which means he has to spend nearly two hours at the tap.If the boy falls ill, then the family simply has to make do with what is left because none of the others knows how to ride a two-wheeler. Should that happen, the good water is reserved for the older people and the younger ones drink salt water. Salt water gives us diarrhea, Hulligeamma explains. At least the young people have the health to withstand it.Sometimes, she begs the neighbours to fetch her a pot too. They can be insulting, she says. They dont have enough to be generous.The dhobi community of Rajoli live along a three feet wide canal. Theres a tap that gives salt water for a few hours in the evening and each family might get five to eight pots on a good day. If the children have any play time after school, they are handed water pots to go look for a tap.Food is cooked in salt water so the dal ends up rare. We have to pour oil and even then it is only half cooked, says Hulligeammas daughter-in-law. Better-off neighbours with fewer mouths to feed, like Yeramma Iraimatti, have switched to vegetables like ladies finger and tomatoes. Yeramma is also one of the rare few who orders water cans from a store.Last week there was a wedding in the wealthier part of the Rajoli. Barely in their twenties, Nagesh and Saraswati wed in the presence of over 500 guests and nearly a hundred stayed over in the neem-shaded house. The young groom says, We had to hire tankers for the water: Rs 500 for the tanker and Rs 800 for a tractor to pull it... I drove it myself. We need two such tankers a day. I wish I hadnt married.Hulligeamma has been called in to do the laundry. Normally my daughters-in-law and I would take the clothes to the canal nearby, she says, but that has dried up. Her regular customers send her a lesser load once a week. Earlier the upper-caste households used to send a bundle twice a week.There is the water stored in a drum (500 litres). We may need four of that for the wedding, but I'll make do with one.But how? Hulligeamma breaks into a wide smile."

While horticulture cultivation in the district has come down only by 6% this year, statistics with the horticulture department show that vegetable cultivation has gone up by 600 hectares or around 9%, due to increase in cultivation of onion.Data shows that almost 50% of the land in the district under fruits, spices, vegetables and flower cultivation is drip irrigated. In 2016-2017, 36,539 hectares of horticulture crops were cultivated in the district against cultivation on 39,000 hectares in the previous financial year. ""While the acreage under fruits, spices and flowers has come down in the district, the area under vegetable cultivation has actually increased by 600 hectares. So acreage wise, we do not see much of a difference from the previous year yet,"" said the deputy director of horticulture, A Ramakrishnan. ""But the cultivation this year has witnessed a noticeable drop when compared to that in 2014-2015 - when we had good rains,"" he said.While acreage under crops like banana, turmeric and tomato has fallen by 200 hectares to 300 hectares, area under onions has gone up. ""Banana and turmeric are long-term crops that require more water and so does tomato to give a good yield. Thus, many farmers have turned to vegetables like onions, chillies and lady's finger which are less fleshy and require less water,"" said Ramakrishnan.The area under plantation crops too has increased by 1,000 hectares, mainly because cocoa inter-crop plantations were also taken into account. Officials attribute the farmers' confidence to cultivate even in the face of such a severe drought, to drip irrigation. ""In the district, only farmers with assured water and irrigation facilities bother cultivating their land. They stopped completely relying on rainfall many years ago,"" said Vasanthi Gnanasekharan, assistant director of horticulture department, Thondamuthur block.""In our district, if you remove the 15,000 hectares of plantation crops like tea, coffee, banana and cocoa from the equation, at least 50% of the remaining 21,000 hectares of cultivable land are drip irrigated,"" said Ramakrishnan. ""Drip irrigation becomes critical during drought situations, because with one large tank of water, we can add the required fertilizer and water almost five acres for four days,"" said A Veeramani, a chilly farmer in Madukkarai . ""In normal situations, the water stock would get over in a day or two, and will not cover the entire five acres,"" he said.The horticulture department now targets getting the entire area under fruit, vegetable and spice cultivation in the district under drip irrigation within the next five years. ""We hope to achieve our targets within three years or maximum five years,"" said Ramakrishnan. ""The government's subsidies of 75% to 100% for the programme also play a major role in achieving our target,"" he said."

While growers are helplessly watching crops wilting, skyrocketing prices are making vegetables unaffordable for most Bengalureans.The worst hit vegetables are tomatoes, gourds, beans and ladys finger, apart from coconuts. The inflow of vegetables such as raddish, carrot, brinjal and cauliflower has fallen steeply, according to M. Muniraju, marketing supervisor, Kolar Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee. There is simply no water, he said.Steep fall in tomato prices during September-December has led to fewer farmers sowing tomatoes in Kolar, but even this crop is hit by drought. There is a large scale loss of tomatoes and the crop harvested this time is not of great quality. I have lost everything this season, said Adireddy, a farmer from Chintamani.A senior procurement official from a leading retail chain in the city said the arrival of quality tomatoes was down to a trickle leading to a surge in prices. A kg of tomato is being sold between Rs. 26 and Rs. 30 in the city.Gourds affected tooThe entire range of gourds, the main crop grown in Devanahalli-Chickballapur belt, has taken a severe beating too.The average price of these gourds in the city retail markets is at an all-time high of about Rs. 60 to Rs. 65 per kg. There is a severe shortage for even drinking water, and its no wonder agriculture has taken a back seat. Most of the tubewells have dried up rendering horticulture paralysed. We are buying drinking water, lamented G. Muniswamy Gowda, a farmer from Devanahalli.Irregular power supply has only worsened the situation. V. Jagadeesha, a farmer from Hoskote, said power is supplied for about three hours during night, which is often intermittent. Only those who have got drip irrigation facility in their farms are saved from the ordeal. Even though you have water in the tubewells, it cannot be drawn without power supply, he said.Vegetable prices are traditionally low during December-March period, as it is the season of avarekai (field beans). However, this season, the arrival of avarekai in the city has come down to a meagre 20% to 30% of the usual. A kg of avarekai is still trading as high as Rs. 40, while by this time it should have been less than Rs. 15.Unless there is rain in March, expected during Ugadi festival, the price of vegetables are only expected to skyrocket, making them scarce in the city and pushing farmers into further distress, said senior officials of HOPCOMs.There is a large-scale loss of tomatoes and the crop harvested this time is not of great quality.

While outlandish, futuristic ideas used to rule the roost in this genre, recent times have brought on-screen scenarios that are no longer completely fictional. With modern scientific advances, technology has become a nearly limitless player in our lives. Resultantly, Artificial Intelligence, cloning and robots have now begun to feature in movies and TV shows almost as notably as actual humans...The much-hyped sequel for Rajnikanth 's Enthiran is slated for release in early 2018, in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi. Although the story is as yet unknown, there is no doubt that the famed Chitti robot from the first movie will play a similarly significant role in 2.0, establishing machines as possible protagonists on Indian screens as well.This anthology television show wowed viewers with its ability to present a satirical yet honest take on contemporary society and its digital advancements, acting as a dark-humoured 'mirror' of the modern world. However, with episodes like Be Right Back and White Christmas, this series upped the ante. Telling haunting tales of extracted, 'cookie' consciousness and clones created to replace the dead, Black Mirror aptly reflects human obsession with virtual realities.Ex Machina is another sci-fi movie that explores the relationship between actual human beings and artificially intelligent bots. Although told mostly through the lens of Caleb (a programmer who is tasked with assessing an android's human qualities), the title and the ending of this movie lead audiences to believe that the story was more about the AI computer (Ava) herself, hinting that technology is playing a bigger role in our lives than previously anticipated.Adapted from two previous movies released in 1973 and 1976, this science-fiction thriller gives audiences a glimpse into an alarming alternative reality where every human desire can be indulged, with no consequences. Set in a Western-themed amusement park inhabited by compliant automatons, Westworld explores a futuristic world where technology paves the way for complete human gratification.Deemed a dystopian fantasy-thriller, Transcendence stunned audiences with its unique plot-line, where the protagonist loses his physical body only to have his consciousness uploaded on to a quantum computer. Elements of drama and romance raise the movie's appeal, but the anti-technology activists shown in it are what make it particularly memorable. Transcendence presents a frightening picture of the possible repercussions of technology being allowed to run rampant.Revolving around the story of an introverted and lonely letter writer, Her was an unconventional movie that broke all precedented norms about human-AI relations. Although set in a futuristic world, the story of Theodore Twombly falling in love with an artifically intelligent operating system is startlingly possible in real life (seeing how the movie was inspired byexisting technology), making Theodore's tale so much more touching.Although scientific advancement does not play a pivotal role in them, here are a few movies whose stories would not move forward if not for the technology in their plots:A laugh-riot, Why Him? is an American movie that follows the story of a protective father meeting his daughter's ludicrous boyfriend, Laird. Although the actors effortlessly carry the movie on their shoulders, the hilarity added by Laird's AI house control system goes a long way in making this a definite comedy.Though it was released over a decade ago, The Prestige has continued to remain a beloved classic because of its stirring account of a bitter battle between two fellow magicians. The stunning revelation at the end  of Nikola Tesla 's machine and its cloning capabilities  only add to the film's aura and charm.- Sanjana Sindhe"

Now, he is posting a high yield from his vegetable cultivation and is making good money from his 100 cents of land.Vanmeega Venkataachalam, who was a professor at a private college in Mayiladuthurai for the past 30 years, decided to be an organic farmer post retirement. Even as he has a good bank balance, leads a sophisticated life and his children earn high in foreign countries, Venkatachalam took the call to be a farmer for the rest of his life and chose the 100 cents of land in Aandaancherry Village, Tharangambadi block for his dream.Following a fully organic method of cultivation, right from preparing soil using goat dung, earth worms and cow dung, through planting the seeds and fertigation, he has got the best results.Speaking to Express, Venkatachalam said, Though I had an option to rest after retirement, I chose to live in my ancestors village and do organic farming. Earlier, I used to finance all the agricultural practices on my land, though not organic and was not involved myself.I have not done organic farming myself earlier and thought I would give it a try now, as I have enough time. On a probation basis, I chose just 1 acre of the two-acre land in January and first replaced the soil as it was laden with chemical fertilizers and started the ploughing works. Then seven loads of cow dung added to the soil and the seeds were sown. For brinjal, tomato, ladies finger and a few other greens, saplings were planted.Referring to the organic fertilizer used, he said, After buying 5 kg of Panchakavya, mixed it with cow dung, fish wastes, earthworms, buttermilk, sugar cane juice and water. After one week of fermentation, 300 ml of this mixture was diluted with 12 litres of water and sprayed in the farm land once a week from the time of sowing and till now.Venkatachalam further said that he has used garlic ginger mixture as an organic pesticide which prevents the entry of insects into his farm. With this, he is getting at least 300 to 400 kg of vegetables per week, while using the chemical fertilizer he just got 200 kgs last year.Last year, I had spent Rs 30,000 for chemical fertilizer on the 100 cents. Besides labour cost, pesticides and irrigation came to Rs 50,000 to grow vegetables. I could not even get back the investment as the yield posted was very less. This year, I could prepare the organic fertilizer with just Rs 6000. As I have also shifted to drip irrigation, I spent Rs 20,000 for the 100 cents and I am now getting good income, Venkatachalam said, expressing his glee."

It is also found in fruits, vegetables, and meat.How does it work?Glutathione is a low molecular weight thiol-tripeptide that plays a prominent role in maintaining intracellular redox balance. In addition to its remarkable antioxidant properties, the discovery of its antimelanogenic properties has led to its promotion as a skin-lightening agent.Glutathione is involved in many processes in the body, including tissue building and repair, making chemicals and proteins needed in the body, and for the immune system.Glutathiones skin-lightening effects result from direct as well as indirect inhibition of the tyrosinase enzyme and switching from eumelanin to phaeomelanin production. It is available in oral, parenteral and topical forms.Currently, there are three trials that support the skin-lightening effect and good safety profile of topical and oral glutathione.Realising this growing trend of consumers wishing for a fairer skin, many pharmaceutical companies are developing different molecules for skin lightening. A lot is already known about topical de-pigmenting agents such as hydroquinone, glycolic acid, arbutin, kojic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E and niacinamide, all of which are readily available over-the-counter.Oral and intravenous glutathione have been available in some countries such as Philippines for many years. This drug has recently made inroads in other countries, including India.Although there is oral medication, the injection shots are considered and proven to be effective.Natural dietary sources of glutathione:Fresh fruits, vegetables, and nuts are natural sources of glutathione. Tomatoes, avocados, oranges, walnuts and asparagus are some of the most common edibles that help to increase levels of glutathione in the body. Whey protein is another rich source of glutathione and has been used to enhance systemic glutathione levels in cystic fibrosis.Pros of glutathione:People take glutathione for treating cataracts and glaucoma, preventing aging, treating alcoholism, asthma, cancer, heart disease, hepatitis, liver disease, diseases that weaken the bodys defence system, memory loss, Alzheimers, osteoarthritis, and Parkinsons disease. Glutathione is also used for maintaining the bodys defense system and in fighting metal and drug poisoning.Healthcare providers give glutathione as a shot (by injection into the muscle) for preventing poisonous side effects of cancer treatment (chemotherapy) and for treating the inability to father a child (male infertility).Healthcare providers also give glutathione intravenously (by injection into the vein, by IV) for preventing anemia in kidney patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment, preventing kidney problems after heart bypass surgery, treating parkinsons disease, improving blood flow and decreasing clotting in individuals with hardening of the arteries, treating diabetes, and preventing toxic side effects of chemotherapy.Does oral glutathione work?Once the glutathione goes into the stomach, it becomes useless and doesnt serve the purpose. Only when it is injected in the veins, it enters the blood and does its magic. Although there are a lot of studies, none could prove that oral glutathione is helpful.The industry is fooling the people in the name of glutathione pills and creams. Infact, grape weed extract and vitamin C helps better in skin lightening than glutathione tablets.The article is compiled by Dr Kannaiah Thallapally, consultant hair-transplant surgeon, cosmetodermotologist at Livyoung Anti-aging Clinic"

The newly-opened cafe, which is run by jail inmates serving life sentence, offers eatables and other products which, as the management proudly announces, are made in jail.To top it all, the notion of being served by jailbirds does not bother customers in the least. On the contrary, they appear to be intrigued by the idea. The ever-present crowd of patrons suggests the obvious lack of ""happy hours"". Many of those who visit the cafe once end up as regular customers and a stream of suggestions pours in.On a regular day at the cafe, Jai Chand, 49 and Yog Raj , 27, don chef 's hats and dish out orders with a brisk efficiency characteristic of professional cooks. Outside the kitchen, customers sit back amid the scenic environs, engrossed in books, pizza and piping hot chai. The chefs' life term at Kaithu Jail , is merely an incidental fact soon forgotten in the comforting aroma of fresh food. The location of the cafe at Takka Bench above the historic Ridge , en-route to the famous Jakhu temple assures a steady stream of visitors. The picturesque location, good food and the lure of books makes it a perfect draw for tourists. The library includes books by Chetan Bhagat, Nikita Singh, Jules Verne Sherlock Holmes and Robin Sharma.Subjects of environment, tourism and Shimla's history have also been covered.The cafe, which can accommodate 40 persons, has been built at a cost of Rs 20 lakh. It remains open from 10 am to 9pm.Besides tourists, the cafe also draws a number of local residents. Appreciating this concept of jail reforms, Shimla resident Nirupama Chaudhary has become a regular customer in the last one week. ""On completion of their sentence, inmates can run their own cafe or restaurant, which will make them self-dependent in future,"" she said.However, she feels readers of newspapers and periodicals should also be catered to. ""It is not possible to read books for hours.In case of hurry, we can go through newspapers and magazines while sipping tea or coffee,"" she suggested, adding that her favourite articles on the menu are pizza and burger.The menu includes tea, coffee, tomato soup, veg paneer puff, veg burger, cup cake, muffin, pastry, medium pizza, peanut cookies, cream roll and karara special, an improved version of hot dog. All these dishes are made in the jails of Kaithu and Kandaghat. Jakhu resident Ajay Sohan Lal said he has been a regular visitor since the day the book cafe opened. ""This is the best place and even the concept is new. I can have coffee while reading a book, which, otherwise, was not possible in the library located close to this cafe,"" he said.Lal wholeheartedly supports the concept of jail reforms.

With the cost of production spiralling, farmers of milk-producing districts are distraught.Unable to get fodder in their vicinity, they source it from distant places at high costs. Despite a government incentive, the establishment of fodder banks and the recent hike in milk prices, farmers of Kolar, Mandya and Shivamogga, which are among the high milk-producing districts, are complaining about the increase in input costs.Dairy farmers of Mandya are looking at Mysuru, Chamarajanagar and other districts to source fodder. Paddy cultivation suffered owing to drought, and this has resulted in shortage of dry grass, said Satisha, a farmer from Budhanuru. Savithramma of Bellur said cattle required at least 15 kg of green fodder every day. She purchases fodder at Rs. 10 a kg  double the normal price of Rs. 5.Steep hikeIn Kolar, fodder availability has been adversely affected as farmers have turned to tomato cultivation, despite the administrations attempt to convince them to grow jowar, which yields good green fodder. With the onset of the tomato season, farmers have moved away from jowar for higher returns.In Shivamogga, the cost has risen steeply as a tonne of fodder, which cost about Rs. 5,800 in March/April 2016, is now being sold at Rs. 11,000 to milk producers coming under the Shivamogga Milk Union Ltd., which covers Shivamogga, Davangere and Chitradurga districts.The situation is similar in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi, where the cost of fodder has increased from Rs. 11 / Rs. 12 to Rs. 15 / Rs. 16 a kg.Sources in the Karnataka Milk Federation acknowledged the shortage but said the federation was confident of sailing through the dry season as many places in the high milk-producing centres had received rainfall.The Animal Husbandry Department confirmed that there was a shortage of fodder.We have established fodder banks but they can meet only part of the demand. Fodder is being given at highly subsidised cost of Rs. 2 a kg, an official said."

They faced much difficulty in bringing the vegetable stock to these towns.Understanding the difficulty faced by them, the Department of Agricultural Marketing and Agri Business came to their aid by commencing the auctioning of vegetables at the Karumanthurai Regulated market premises itself. Manikumar, PA (agriculture) to the Collector, and Selladurai, secretary of the Salem Marketing Committee, inaugurated the auctioning.Traders from Salem and Attur participated in the auction and about five tonnes of vegetables was procured by them.The department has proposed to hold the auction daily soon.A cross-section of the farmers of Karumanthurai said that they faced a lot of difficulty in bringing their produce to the plains and had to spend much for transporting them.

You may not spot them in the market but these exotic veggies are available at agricultural scientist D Prabhakar Rao's sprawling farm . Even wasabi mustard and the nearly-extinct Bangladeshi long brinjal can be found here.Rao, a trustee of Sri Sri Institute of Agricultural Sciences and Technology, has a passion for collecting exotic desi seeds of vegetables from across the globe. He has preserved over 142 seeds from more than 25 countries.""These exotic species are not new. They are old varieties, which are native to India. We may have lost them over the years, but they are found in various other parts of the world. For example, I got the seeds of lemon-flavoured cucumber and cinnamon basil from east European countries like Bulgaria. A rare variety of tomatoes, which are big in size, is from Romania,"" he said. Blue tomatoes, Hanuman Ghada lauki (a desi variety of bottle guard that weighs 1.5kg per piece) and purple lady's finger are among the exotic varieties grown at Rao's farm near Kanakapura, over 35kms from BengaluruFarmers from many parts of the country have benefited from Rao's 20-year-long quest, as he has shared rare seeds with them. ""A farmer in Nelamangala sells red romaine tomatoes for Rs 300 per kg, and they're in demand,"" he said, adding that none of the varities is hybrid.Rao, who practises natural farming , believes a farmer should visit the market only to sell and not to buy. An advocate of natural farming, he has trained more than 5,000 ryots  adivasis in Chattisgarh, and farmers in Shiggavi and Belagavi  through his audits on drought-hit areas.According to him, organic farming is not the same as natural farming. ""I practice and train farmers on natural farming. ""In organic farming, cow dung from 20 cows is used annually for one acre of land. But in natural farming, the same amount is enough for 20 acres of land. In organic farming, farm yard manure is not very helpful for plants. But in natural farming, the Jeevamrutha mixture  consisting of fresh cow urine, cow dung, jaggery and gram flour  is more effective as the living microorganisms help improve soil quality,"" Rao explained, adding that organic farming is a European concept.Rao, who has a specialization in climate-resilient agriculture, will address the crowd at a two-day national summit on 'Innovative Approach to World Nutrition and Food Security ' at the Art of Living Intenational Center in Kanakapura on May 9 and 10.In Karnataka, sowing is done in June since rain is expected in July and August. ""But owing to climate change, we have been receiving copious rain only by September. So in North Karnataka, we have trained farmers to sow both tur dal and chickpea at the same time in the same farm so that they don't suffer crop loss even if one fails,"" Rao added."

The prices of green leafy vegetables have also gone up by 50 % and it is likely to escalate further by at least 50 % during the next fortnight, as indicated by vendors at Kaktives and Shaniwarkoot on Sunday. The increase in the prices of vegetables, which was bound to shoot up every passing week owing to shortage of water on account of the summer conditions and a third year of drought in the district, has hit hard families in the lower income group and the middle class. These sections have already been hit by steep increase in the prices of pulses and foodgrains, sugar and other commodities during the last two years. These families are now forced to cut down their consumption by half.A buyer said that he used to buy a kg of tomatoes once in three or four days till recently but is now buying only half a kilogram.He said that as the prices are bound to shoot up further very soon, we have to cut down our consumption further and need to be more economical while buying vegetables till the monsoon sets in and prices start falling.Vendors said that the prices were shooting up due to a fall in production in view of shortage of water, leading to a decline in arrivals in the wholesale markets.Meanwhile, a substantial stock of vegetables from the district went to Goa every day. Apparently, the typical demand-supply gap was growing and it would keep growing for at least three more months."

To the Ahmedabad crime world, these are aliases of criminals as colourful as their personas. Crime is perhaps the only profession where having an ominously threatening nickname is a good career move. Where Mumbai has `Tiger' Memon or `Chhota' Rajan, Ahmedabad has its own line-up of felons, identified by their aliases got from their looks, habits, modus operandi or physical traits.Ahmedabad's Spiderman is no cute crime-fighting webslinger. He is 32-year-old Omkar Bhadoria, a resident of Ranip, who has been named in more than 50 cases of murder, loot and burglaries. ""His special skill is using pipes to break into houses at night. He targets houses on the topmost floor of a building. He slides down the pipe from the terrace to the house, burgles it and slides down the pipe to safety even as people look for him on the stairs or the terrace,"" said police.Interestingly, Bhadoria does not flee the society. ""He crawls up the pipes to the terrace in an adjacent building tower and spends the night there.When dawn breaks, he escapes with the loot. He also keeps changing his house frequently to avoid getting caught,"" said the police, who gave him the nickname after discovering his modus operandi.Usually, the police have a limited role in the `naamkaran' of goons. Often, their gang members or locals give them such singular sobriquets. ""The names give them a unique identity. It also strikes fear in the hearts of locals and rivals,"" said a senior officer.Kalupur residents Satish Ruparelia and Raju Panchal murdered a businessman in Shahibaug, cut off his head and dumped it at Adalaj ni Vaav in the early 90's. ""When they went to jail, Ruparelia got the name `Badi Mundi' while Panchal became `Chhoti Mundi,"" he said. Similarly, Kalu `Gardan' of Juhapura who was arrested for his alleged involvement in the murder of social activist Nadeem Saiyed earned the nickname because he would always attack his victim on the neck first.""When the details of such men are entered into our records, we retain the nicknames to help us identify them easily,"" said police.This might be a tad difficult when it comes to Bakra, or should that be Bakras ? Vijay `Bakra' Chunara of Gota is an expert chain-snatcher and burglar. ""The 34-year-old has terrible hygiene. He hates taking baths and stinks so much that even when we arrest him, we make him stand downwind to avoid gagging,"" said a crime branch official. Smelly as a goat, it is easy to deduce how he ended up with his nickname.Then, there's Ajay `Bakra' of Sardarnagar who is notorious for stealing laptops, as well as snatching chains and cash. ""He is always seen chom ping on vegetables. He will walk past vegetable laaris and pick up carrots, radishes, tomatoes to munch. Due to this habit, people began calling him bakra,"" said police.Zakir Shaikh Vejalpur is `Chuha' because he is sharp as a rat and tough to catch. ""Shaikh, who is involved in about 20 cases of house break-ins, has sharp hearing which alerts him to the presence of people. He scuttles away, abandoning his work rather than be caught,"" said police.Ritesh Garange of Kubernagar who specialises in stealing laptops from cars is known as `Andho' as he acts blind and fools his victims into belie ving he is innocent. ""When the victim looks elsewhere, Garange will steal laptops or other valuables from the vehicle within seconds. He operates mainly in areas like Satellite and CG Road,"" said police. Pappu Sharma of Vatva, who is accused of theft and robbery, is called Pappayyu by his gang as the 48-yearold's face resembles the papaya fruit.Gufran Pathan (37) of Rakhial who is accused of theft and loot is known as Hanuman due to his resemblance to the Monkey God.`Mungdo' is the moniker of Rajesh Jiliya, a 35-year-old from Kubernagar who steals insignificant things inclu ding animals like goats. ""He hardly speaks. So, people call him mungdo (dumb),"" said police.Aman Pathan, a 43-year-old from Juhapura who was charged with theft and possession of arms is known as `Bhangariyo', because he was a scrap dealer before he turned to crime. Kirit `Dhoom' got his nickname after a tipoff led cops to him for masterminding highway robberies using high-speed bikes. His MO was similar to ones used in the movie `Dhoom' and his gang members christened him with the nickname.In many cases, gang mates and even the police don't know the real names of the gangsters since they are known only by their nicknames. DCP Deepen Bhadran said, ""Aliases of names are an important part of police records and it plays a significant role in crime detection. Many criminals are known by their aliases whereas their names may not strike a chord."""
5922eea37be9e01fc7f5c05a,Non-veg fare? Only if you are a foreigner,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/non-veg-fare-only-if-you-are-a-foreigner/articleshow/58571263.cms,2017-05-08,,The Times Of India,"If you are not a foreigner , you will not be served non-vegetarian food at private hospitals in Ahmedabad. Hospitals, in general, are not known for serving appetizing meals . However, patients here face a different sort of problem, revealed a Mirror Check. Hospitals here force you to follow vegetarianism, especially if you are Indian. They either flatly refuse to serve non-vegetarian food to Indians, or ask you to shift to the international ward to get the fare of your choice. These same hospitals have no such restrictions for foreigners admitted there. In their defence, the hospitals claim that they serve vegetarian food to Indian patients 'to respect the sentiments of the majority', but make an exception for foreign patients 'as they aren't used to vegetarian food'.UN-FARE PRACTICE AT HOSPITALSMirror visited eight hospitals to check the ground reality. Of these, Sterling, Columbia Asia, Zydus, and SAL -- serve vegetarian fare to patients and their relatives. They also do not allow people to eat non-vegetarian food on the premises, even if it has been brought from home. Of the four remaining hospitals, CIMS and HCG serve non-vegetarian fare but only to foreign patients. They do not cook the food on the premises. Instead, they order it from eateries. At Apollo hospital, non-vegetarian food is prepared on the premises and served freely to foreign patients. Indians are served non-vegetarian food only if there is a ""medical requirement"". Non-vegetarian food is prepared and served to both Indian and foreign patients at Krishna Shalby, provided the Indian patients shift to the international wing of the hospital. None of these hospitals have issued or put up any official notification in this regard.Taking objection to the unfair treatment, bank officer J K Nair (49), whose wife was recently hospitalised, says, ""This is discrimination, plain and simple. We cannot be treated as second-grade people in our own country for something as rudimentary as our food choices. If hospitals think it is okay for a foreign patient to consume non-vegetarian food, what ground do they have to deny us the same option?"" Mohammed Jamaluddin (52), an engineer whose nephew has been hospitalised for the past 10 days, says, ""The hospital may not want to cook non-vegetarian food in its kitchen but they should at least allow us to bring it from home. We respect other people's feelings. We can eat it in a secluded corner or in our room with our relatives.I have been to hospitals in Mumbai and they do not have any such restrictions. No one should be deprived of the basic freedom to eat what they want."" Businessman Abbas Manji Pir Bhai also pointed out that such discrimination existed only here. ""My daughter was admitted to a hospital in Delhi for afew weeks. They offered non-vegetarian fare to all patients, whether Indian or foreign,"" says the 67-year-old. Satbir Singh (24), an engineer, believes food goes a long way in curing a patient as much as medicines do. ""Being a non-vegetarian, I know that chicken soup would make me feel much better than tomato soup would. So long as I am having it in my private space, it should not be a problem for anybody.""Meanwhile, hospitals claim they do not offer non-vegetarian fare to Indian patients out of respect. Dr Nikhil Lala, centre head of Sterling says, ""I see no need for our hospital to provide non-vegetarian food as it is not a medical need. We ensure that the patient's protein requirement is fulfilled through vegetarian food."" Bhanupratap Hada, operation head of Zydus confirms, ""We do not serve non-vegetarian food in our hospitals. We have our own kitchen and patients are not allowed food from outside."" SAL Hospital refused to issue an official statement, but clarifies that it serves only vegetarian food.Apollo hospital states, ""A variety of specialised meals, including non-vegetarian fare, are provided to our patients on the advice of our doctors and dieticians. We have separate kitchen and storage facilities for cooking vegetarian and non-vegetarian food items."" Dr Bharat Gadhvi, regional director of HCG Gujarat, admits that Indians and foreigners were offered separate fares at the hospital. ""We get nonvegetarian food from outside for international patients only. For the rest of the patients and their relatives everything is strictly vegetarian.""'80PER CENT PATIENTS ARE VEGETARIANS'On allowing non-vegetarian food only to foreigners, Dr Anish Chandarana, executive director of CIMS hospital clarifies, ""It is hard for international patients to sustain a vegetarian diet as they are not used to it. Hence, we get it for them from hotels. The reason why hospitals have adopted a vegetarian- only policy for Indians is because 80 per cent of patients tend to be vegetarian and they may have a very strong emotional reaction to people who eat non-vegetarian food around them."" Explaining why Indian patients have to be shifted to another wing if they want to have non-vegetarian fare, Shanay Vikram Shah, director of Shalby hospitals says, ""We have a separate kitchen on the top floor for non-vegetarian food. The international wing is located on the floor below it and all the patients there are provided non-vegetarian food. If there are any Indian patients who need non-vegetarian fare, they can have it after shifting to the international wing.""DIFFERENT CITIES, DIFFERENT POLICIESInterestingly, some hospitals which have branches in Ahmedabad as well as other cities have policies that differ according to the city it is in. For example, Columbia Asia of Ahmedabad allows only vegetarian but their Bangalore branch has no restrictions upon non-vegetarian food. Gaurav Anand, general manager of Columbia Asia, confirms they allow ""only vegetarian"" food in the hospital. However, Pratyush Srivastava, general manager of Columbia Asia Hospital at Whitefield in Bangalore says, ""We serve non-vegetarian food to patients and their kin. We do not allow outside food in the hospital.The food served here is prepared in our kitchen as per guidelines from the dietician."" A hospital has every right to institute rules, but then it should be implemented without discrimination, avers designer Reuben Vaz (23). ""If their policy is pro-vegetarian, then it should be the same for everyone. If the Indians are not being provided non-vegetarian food, then foreigners should not be provided the same. It is not like foreigners have never had vegetarian food in their entire lives. It shouldn't be a problem for them to survive on it for a few days. People should not be divided based on their food choices,"" he says."

(Right) The logo of the canteen.Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Friday finalised modalities to launch the ambitious Indira Canteen project offering subsidised breakfast and meals to the urban poor in Bengaluru.At a meeting at his official residence, Siddaramaiah directed starting the project from August 15.The state government is pumping in Rs 100 crore for the project while the BBMP will be the nodal agency for its implementation.Mayor G Padmavathi told reporters after the meeting that canteens will be made up of pre-cast structures manufactured by KEF Infra at their Tamil Nadu facility.The firm has quoted Rs 32 lakh for constructing each canteen with a carpet area of 860 sq ft. She said Siddaramaiah has directed officials to negotiate with KEF Infra to reduce the construction cost.Padmavathi said, There will be 199 canteens including the one at the BBMP head office and 28 kitchens, one each in every Assembly constituency in the city. These canteens can accommodate 70 to 80 people at a time. There will be a coupon system offering meals and tiffin to a maximum of 250 people in one slot.The Mayor said each canteen will have two toilets, a CCTV camera and food a distribution court. The utensils will belong to the state government so that services are not hampered in case food supply contract is terminated and transferred to another agency.The contracts will be finalised by May 30 and work would commence from June 1. By August 1, these canteens will be completely ready to start the programme from August 15, said Padmavathi.Regarding the menu, she said beaten rice bath, uppittu (upma) and idli will be offered for breakfast while the meal will consist of sambar, rasam, rice and pickle.On Sundays, there will be one special item like tomato rice, jeera rice, puliyogare and lemon rice. BBMP commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad said locations for setting up the canteens have been identified. He said the canteens have been designed by different architects.Stree Shakti Sanghas to cook mealsThe government will rope in Stree Shakti Sanghas (SSS) for preparing meals, said Mayor Padmavathi. At least 33% of these canteens and their kitchens will be managed by the SSS, said the Mayor adding that the idea is to empower these SSS."

The first sign of stirring was with the opening of Rakesh Talwars Spare Kitchen II, followed by the jazzy and spacious Matahari night club and now, most recently Swey.Spread across a sprawl of 14,000 square feet, Swey can accommodate 400 people at a go. The eatery, located on the malls level four, is whatever you want it to be: a caf, a pub, a bar or a restaurant that serves you wholesome food, under corporate chef Clyde Comellos direction. Owners Gaurav Dabrai, Vicky and Kabir Luthria, (who also own the kitschy Dishikiyaaon at Bandra Kurla Complex and Copa at Juhu), have utilised the space well, ensuring pockets of private party spaces for large groups ranging from 10 to 30 people.We love the restaurants direction pole that points to all their outposts across the city. Fun elements like a phone booth where you can step in to take a call, and a mandatory stop for all diners: a copper swing for selfies  are the lighter design touches.The rooftop bar has a drinks menu thats by far the best we have tried in a long time. Food and drink meet in two cocktails that we tried out. The first: a cheese me martini (Rs. 550) does not overwhelm the palate but makes its presence felt with the blue cheese and stuffed olives. The second, an apple a day (Rs. 550), which is vodka mixed with a buttery apple jam, comes with an apple crumble rim. If you like to mix your dessert and drinks, this one is for you. But the drink, who knows Donald (Rs. 650), with bourbon-soaked cranberries, with homemade bitters and sugar, steals our hearts. One of our dinner companions succumbs to healthier option: a kale and hearty (Rs. 500), a light vodka-based drink which tastes of a cooling cucumber and kale juice, an admirable combination.The food and drinks menus have been designed by outlet chef Hansel Baptista, and from the first bite of magic mushrooms (Rs. 350), in which the crispy roasted fungi act as makeshift sliders holding cheese and beetroot slices, we know we are in for a treat. The wood-fired pizzas are juicy square flat breads, which are easier to eat. The smoky salmon and ricotta pizza (Rs. 750) has the sweetness of red onions balanced by the sourness of tiny balsamic jelly beans. The feta beignets (Rs. 375) are deep-fried and bland but for the addition of sweet tomato jam reserve. The stuffed calamari (Rs. 500) with a centre-filling of masala prawn chilly fry is chewy, but the zing of East Indian bottle masala dominates pleasantly.Chef Baptista presents the duck waffle two ways but in a croissant just for us to try. The chunks of duck pieces are pan-seared and medium-rare cooked in a pomegranate jus, and a tangy duck confit with orange tang and spices. We are instant fans of the healthy veg spaghetti (Rs. 450) that has thinly sliced veggies as noodles, and spiced roast cashews tossed in a Himalayan rhododendron vinaigrette that adds crunch. The deconstructed ham and cheese toasty salad (Rs. 450) falls flat for its bland dressing as we dont enjoy bite-size pieces of ham slices between toasted bread.For the main course we settle for a kimchi fried rice (Rs. 500) which is peppered with spiced tofu, fried lotus root and thin strips of noori. A Korean dish which traditionally comprises a broken egg, we are served a sunny side up, which we prefer as is. The dish is a roller-coaster of textures  the crunch of lotus stem, and raw vegetables, the softness of tofu pieces and al dente rice cooked in a fiery red sauce.By now, we are stuffed, but theres plenty of room for dessert. We begin with three shots (Rs. 750), which can be ordered sans alcohol too: a negroni with 55% dark chocolate, cinnamon flavoured yogurt and orangechilo cheesecake. The negroni shot has a potato chip dunked in chocolate sauce, while the flavoured yoghurt needs more cinnamon. The orangechilo cheesecake rules our palate with its tangy presence. The syrups are all house made and the absence of synthetic syrup ensures we wont croak with a hoarse voice the next day.Dive into dessertsA fitting end to the meal is the desserts. The bittersweet symphony of theres bourbon in my cheesecake (Rs. 330) topped with a smoked honey is a hit. But the pice de rsistance is the hazelnut entremet. The dessert has a crunchy ganache base topped with a hazelnut meringue thats served with a coffee amaretto Bavarian ice cream with caramel.

With the wind comes clouds of fly-ash in the village, blurring the vision.The effects of pollution starts from a radius of at least 10km from the plant  from the hems of Nagpur city  but it intensifies as you cross villages and move towards the plant. The damage is not just restricted to health but also crops and drinking water.Last week, TOI reported about environmentalists questioning the all-is-well air quality monitoring data of Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and Mahagenco, that runs KTPS. While both agencies boast of low emissions of total particulate matter (TPM)  a total of hazardous particles suspended in air  scores of villagers living around the plant are suffering since years. And the three new units, which were dedicated to the nation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 14, have only added to their woes.""We are virtually forced to breathe, eat and drink fly ash. The vegetables that are growing in the fields are covered with it. If we keep papads to dry or a bucket of water outside, they get coated with a layer of ash,"" says Rekha Kautare , a Suradevi resident.The fly-ash-coated vegetables grown at Koradi are consumed by Nagpurians too as they are sold in the city. ""There is a steady flow of vegetables throughout the year from villages around Koradi. They are washed at source point itself as the people will not buy such vegetables. They also have less shelf life,"" said Suresh Jawande, a vegetable wholesaler at Cotton Market.Till a few years ago, the villagers here would grow a variety of leafy vegetables, tomatoes and other greens. ""Since last year, we have stopped growing them because the quality and quantity was not good. Many times, our crops wilt due to high deposition of fly-ash. If our yield in normal conditions should have been 75%, now it is only 30-35%,"" says Ramesh Kawde, a farmer of the same village.In 2012, TOI had visited Lonkhairi and nearby villages where crops were damaged by fly-ash. A joint survey was done by Mahagenco and agriculture department officials. The report submitted by them stated that the damage had occurred but talks of compensation allegedly remains on paper.That time, villagers growing oranges had said that they will chop down the trees if fly-ash problem was not solved.Today, many have done it in surrounding villages. ""Some villagers had orange orchards. The fly-ash used to get heavily deposited on the flowers and the fruits wouldn't grow. Yields went down by half and therefore, they decided to chop down the trees,"" says Gunvanta Raut, former sarpanch of Ghogali village, located 5-6km from KTPS.Sanjay Bhoyar, professor of soil science at Dr Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth (PKV), who has done a PhD on use of fly-ash in agriculture, says that fly-ash deposition is extremely harmful for the crops. ""It gets deposited on hydrathodes of leaves affecting the transpiration process and thus, hampering photosynthesis,"" he told TOI.Bhoyar further says that if the electro-static precipitators (ESPs) function properly, then the emissions should go down by 99.99%. ""If ESPs are not functioning properly, then Mahagenco authorities should take immediate remedial steps,"" he added.Bhoyar rued that even though Mahagenco's predecessor MSEB had been told that use of wet fly-ash was good for agriculture, no steps had been taken by the authorities.Crop damage can be seen but the bigger damage is to the health, which is not fully visible right now. ""My mother-in-law is suffering from asthma since last few years and my son repeatedly suffers from cough and cold. Five months ago, an old woman in our village died of an asthma attack,"" says Kautare.Respiratory problems and other health ailments have been haunting the villagers since last many years. TOI visited five villages within 10km of KTPS where residents complained of health problems due to air pollution. Surprisingly, none of these most-affected villages are chosen for air quality monitoring by MPCB or Mahagenco. The list of villages where monitoring was done was provided to TOI by MPCB.Dr Gyaneshwar Dhanole , a medical practitioner in Mahadula, another village close to KTPS, concurs with the villagers. ""Respiratory ailments are common in the area. Those who fall prey to them are unable to recuperate completely. While in other places kids get viral fever mostly when season changes. However, here they suffer from it all the year round,"" he says.Even a village like Bailwada, which is some 10km from the plant, suffers from KTPS pollution. ""Our crop yield has reduced by 20% due to fly-ash. Asthma is a common problem. Every morning, we find our utensils, vehicles, in fact everything, covered with a thick layer of dry ash,"" says resident Rishi Dakhore.While Mahagenco claims that it holds health camps in the affected villages, residents said that the company had held an eye check-up camp. ""They have never held a camp for overall health,"" was the common refrain of residents of the villages TOI visited.Dr Sanjay Jaiswal, deputy director of health (Nagpur), says that no health camps are held. ""We have primary health centres (PHCs) in villages where people can go for treatment,"" he adds. However, most villagers prefer to go to private hospitals in Koradi and Nagpur as ""PHCs do not give prompt service.""In an earlier clarification sent to TOI, Mahagenco had denied ill-effects of air pollution on the ground that there was no such data with the PHCs. Since no camps were held, there is no data too.If crop damage and air pollution was not enough, KTPS is also polluting drinking water in many villages. ""Mahagenco releases water through a canal near our village. Sometimes oil flows with water and pollutes our groundwater. When we complain, the officials just take perfunctory steps to solve the problem,"" says Maharoti Bhange from Ghogli.A TOI photographer attempted to drink the well water but was unable to do so because of the atrocious taste.Bhoyar says, ""If the ESPs don't work properly, mercury is emitted, which oxidizes and converts into mercury oxide. When it gets dissolves in water and enters the food chain through fish, it is very dangerous for the nervous system of humans.""Frequent flooding, especially during monsoons is another curse of the plant for Ghogli villagers. ""Water from Totladoh collects in a pond near our village which is then transported to the plant through a canal. This canal is not de-silted regularly which results in flooding,"" says sarpanch of the village Gajanan Wankhede.Even though Mahagenco admitted to the problem after complaints made by Wankhede, the company has not taken up rehabilitation work under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). This is evident from an internal communication between two chief engineers through a letter on October 30, 2015. ""The buildings in the village should be shifted as per the directions of sub-divisional officer (SDO) under CSR,"" the letter states.""Our records on CSR activities run into voluminous pages and cannot be provided over mail or phone,"" a KTPS official told TOI.Meanwhile, Nagpur city is also feeling the effects pollution. When activist Ankita Shah recently shared TOI's story about KTPS pollution on the social media, Nagpurians complained that the pollution has reached city's northern areas. ""A friend complains that he has his office at Nelson Square, and if windows are left open for half-an-hour, he gets asthma attack,"" commented Deepanshu Khirwadkar.Madhurita Dhar, a resident of Mankapur, says, ""Residents living on higher floors are constantly exposed to dry ash. If we don't do dusting every day, a thick layer gets deposited on everything.""Based on TOI's reports, Shah has filed a complained with the PMO which has asked the member secretary of the pollution control board to file an action taken report within 15 days, which is before April 30. Some environmentalists see this as a meaningless exercise.""The pollution control board's figures were shockingly lower than the norms, which is well-nigh impossible,"" said Kaustav Chatterjee, member of an NGO which works in the green sector. ""The MPCB cannot be expected to conduct an enquiry on itself."""

Apart from milk, homegrown dairy giant Amul will now procure and sell fruits and vegetables at their outlets.The Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) that markets dairy products under brand Amul is seriously explring possibility of buying fresh vegetables and fruits directly from farmers in the villages from where it procures milk on daily basis.For this, GCMMF has roped in the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) to carry out technical evaluation of the project.To begin with, Amul is looking to start selling vegetables and fruits in Ahmedabad where it runs over 200 parlours.""On January 26, we had signed a MoU with Gujarat government to help farmers get better price for their agri produce,"" said R S Sodhi, managing director of GCMMF,Amul may replicate the Delhi model of Safal that is engaged in retailing of fresh fruits and vegetables along with value-added products, he said. Safal, the fruit and vegetable arm of Mother Dairy, a subsidiary of NDDB was the first company to organize the fruits and vegetables business in the country.The proposal came up for discussion during the recent board meeting of GCMMF in which chairman of all the 17 district dairy unions of Gujarat who are member unions of the federation had participated at Palanpur.""We are studying the procedure on how to start procurement and marketing of different vegetables including tomatoes, cauliflowers, brinjals, onions among others,"" GCMMF's chairman Jetha Patel told TOI.""If we succeed in our study, the vegetables will be marketed under brand Amul and will be procured by our member unions,"" he said, adding that the federation officials have been asked to carry out enterprise study and give their report.""This will not only benefit the vegetable producers but also benefit consumers as the role played by middlemen will get eliminated. Producers dealing in horticulture will get better price while consumers will get the agri produce at affordable price with trusted brand name of Amul,"" he said."
5922f7ab7be9e01fc0070997,Reflections on the election of our time,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/reflections-on-the-election-of-our-time/article17464130.ece,2017-03-15,,The Hindu,"The Uttar Pradesh election results are like a riddle wrapped in an enigma. The sheer scale of the victory, the arithmetic, shows it was a tsunami that no one had predicted. More than the act of prediction in the form of the exit polls that confounded us, the problem lay in deciphering the results. At the macrolevel, it is like watching the arrival of a juggernaut, whose presence now looks inevitable, but which still requires an explanation of how it came there. At a microlevel, one looks at pieces which make as little sense as the whole picture. It is not the immediacy of the result that challenges us but what it implies for the future.This is a strange election where one man became a national phenomenon. As a wag put it, Narendra Modi became a final cause, remote cause and immediate cause of the election results. He represented the idea of India the majority wanted. People believed his words, and his utterances such as development, nationalism and Make in India acquired a shelf life beyond the original meaning of these terms. What Mr. Modi seemed to convey is what I call a lowest common denominator democracy. He has created a  roti, kapda aur makan (food, clothing and shelter) imagination for the new middle classes. His communalism  which he wore like a badge, pretending it is a patriotism  is so blatant and confident that it challenges the old tenets of secularism making it irrelevant. When a Prime Minister, not merely a head of a party, refuses to allocate a single seat to a Muslim candidate in U.P., the message is clear. He has pushed out an old political vocabulary which already had a shop-soiled quality. His style of electoral ambush of appropriating the Oppositions favourite stereotypes was acutely tactical.Consider the issue of demonetisation. He was not devaluing currency but instead rendering some older political styles effete. The Congress and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) could no longer claim to be the spokespersons of the poor. Ironically, Mr. Modi made demonetisation speak a political rather than an economic language. He demonetised political currency and challenged the bankability of terms such as secularism. Simultaneously, he appropriated the pro-poor platform by pretending to be anti-rich. He became an anti-corruption crusader in that sense, telling the poor that he was their way out of their current world. His combination of patriotism and anti-poverty became a potent brew.The strategyLet me be clear. It is a strategy that we have to understand. Mr. Modi formulated a symbolic strategy, while BJP president Amit Shah spelt out the tactics on the ground. He created a sense of the new, promising a sense of the world by appealing to demography and a new generation. He did it in two ways. He cleared the decks by treating Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi as old furniture. But he went beyond this by suggesting almost blatantly that the stereotypes of caste and ideology were outdated because change has dated them. Such categories create the captive minds of the old electoral politics.What he was offering was a simple, aspirational, mobile society where those at the bottom of the pyramid  a clichd word for the poor  feel a different sense of possibilities. His overt change in style, dress, and his muted muscularity all helped create an effective veneer around his political style. This not only added to his vote catching power among Dalits but also made old warhorses such as BSP leader Mayawati appear like yesterdays newspaper. What Mr. Modi was signalling to each caste category which had frozen into a vote bank was that caste alone would not work. One needed development, innovation, a new sense of energy, and not the old lethargy of waiting for reservation. Mr. Modi hinted that the politics of ressentiment had to be replaced by a strategy of mobility.Capturing the imaginationThird, Mr. Modi realised, that the medias understanding of the social order was incomplete. He had a better hearing aid to listen to what I call grassroots voices. They spoke a different language of immediacy unembellished by the rhetoric of concepts. Mr. Modis concepts such as Make in India were more performative, promising delivery of the goods and competence better than any of the words that the socialists or the Congress offered to the people. It is in this sense that one has to understand that his victory was not merely an organisational victory created by Mr. Shah and the millions of party workers on the ground but also a literal capturing of the mass imagination. It was so total that it was virtually emasculating to the Opposition. Brutally put, it went beyond a capture of votes to a seduction of the imagination. It captured not only the working concepts of todays electoral language but also the very grids of thought that determine the thought styles of the future. It is in recognising this that this article, which till now appears like a compilation of what made the BJP tick, becomes a symptomatology of fears. Let me admit that I might have got my psephology wrong but my intuition tells me that my sense of the future might be pathetically and prophetically right.An epitaph for the oldThink of a few simple facts. Here is a party which even after the Gujarat riots is virtually contemptuous or indifferent to the Muslim, clear that this critical election did not need the help of any Muslim candidates. Mr. Modi has also told Dalits that their politics, like minoritarianism, is doomed. The two great concepts that created the compost heap of Indian electoral politics, the vote banks which have acquired a reified life of their own, are socialism and secularism. Mr. Modi, in rendering them effete, has also created a set of closures we must understand. It is clear that while mobility is an aspirational dream, dissent today is an almost extinct possibility between the inanity of the left and the liberals and the hostility of the BJP regime. What we are facing is individual aspiration but a death of the old categories which at one time created the romance and the Utopian around words such as justice and equality.The U.P. elections show that the old covenant around the concepts we once held sacred is dead. The hegemony of the BJP-Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-Bajrang Dal combine is almost clear. What we face is what I am going to call the closure of the Indian mind. There are few possibilities of new political dreams. Mr. Modi is offering a straitjacket of a narrow idea of development and globalisation which contain no alternative possibilities, no dissent, no side bets. It is not a post-truth society we are confronting but a creation of a captive mind. This society by choosing Mr. Modi has closed itself to many great imaginations. What we see is not a new generation speaking a new liberated politics but a bowdlerised society oozing simplicities, created by the masterminds of propaganda. India, like the United States, has today become a collection of hard hat minds, facing a tragedy where the aspiration is global but the categories are parochial while masquerading themselves as national. Mr. Modis victory signals the victory of the parochial and affordably mediocre over any vision of the cosmopolitan or plural. Deep down, it is the future which we have lost today. This is Indian democracys most ironic gift.Shiv Visvanathan is Professor, Jindal Global Law School and Director, Centre for the Study of Knowledge Systems, O.P. Jindal Global University"

Photo: R.V. MoorthyIn Barkheda village of Badayun, agitated villagers pounce on me to complain that instead of four-time BJP MLA Ram Sewak Patel, the Bharatiya Janata Party has selected businessman Mahesh Gupta, an outsider. Sher Singh Chauhan, a young BJP worker, and Satbir Singh Chauhan, a VHP activist, are the most vocal in this Thakur-dominated village, where all  including Valmikis and Mauryas  but the Muslims are likely BJP voters.Ram Sewakji will fight as an Independent, Satbir Singh says. He is the Hindutva face here; the RSS also wanted Patel but didnt succeed in prevailing on the BJP leadership. Well all work for him. Suddenly, his mobile phone rings  Ram Sewak has got the Shiv Sena ticket, he announces, and a cheer goes up.Saying that Mr. Patels fellow Kurmis, traditionally BJP-backers, will shift with him, Satbir Singh claims that Kurmis in the neighbouring Shekhupur seat, too, will vote against the BJP.Less than an hour later, in Konar, also in Badayun, the majority Jatavs are rooting for the Bahujan Samaj Party. But the village also has Khatiks and Dhobis, Dalit communities who traditionally back the BJP. As I talk to the Jatavs, an SUV sweeps in: the BJPs Naresh Singh Patel, a Kurmi, jumps out. He has come to seek votes for not the BJP but the Shiv Sena. Why?[BJP president] Amit Shah had promised to select candidates on the basis of a survey. That hasnt been done; the BJP wont get a majority, an angry Mr. Patel says.  Modiji ka hawa nikal gaya (Modis balloon has been punctured).As I drive through western U.P., I find similar stories of young dynasts or of outsiders  such as the party-hopping Avtar Singh Badana, a Gujjar millionaire from Haryanas Faridabad  getting ticket, of effigies of Mr. Shah being burnt or of protests being staged.Indeed, the BJP did not need irate party workers at this stage. The Hindu-Muslim polarisation that powered the BJP to a sweep in the 2014 general elections in U.P. is muted, the high the party experienced after last years surgical strikes against Pakistan has evaporated with demonetisation. Today, the partys old core voters are intact, but there is some attrition in the two sections that it was hoping would see it through  upper castes and the most backward castes.In Budhana in Muzaffarnagar, a large section of Jat farmers are with the BJP, but some are considering other options. With demonetisation, the BJP has hurt everyone; farmers like us have been destroyed. Well vote for Ajit Singhs party, said Balbir Singh.In western U.P.s district courts, upper caste lawyers are divided. And Kulbhushan Shatma, a Brahmin, is clear, The BJP is on the wane.The RSS that worked very hard in 2014, appear to be more relaxed now. Kamal Purwar in Bareilly backs Sangh spokesperson Manmohan Vaidyas controversial statement on the need to end reservation (even though similar remarks by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat before the Bihar polls damaged the BJPs support base among the MBCs )."

Its their ATM in fact. The rural economy here would have been battered but for African Tall Maize (ATM).The crop is providing an assured and steady income for farmers while also boosting dairy farming with a regular supply of fodder for cattle. ATM, a low water-intensive crop, is being grown throughout the year now as a fodder crop.Concerted efforts by local farmers, the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) and the Kolar district administration in encouraging cultivation of ATM are now paying dividends.Suresh is among the many farmers in Doddahasahalla village of Kolar taluk who have entered into an agreement with the local milk cooperative union to grow ATM. ""Earlier, I used to grow tomato or other vegetables, he says. The problem with tomato is that you are never sure of the income. If all goes well, I might make Rs 1.5 lakh per acre in one season and almost nothing the next.""Fed up with unpredictable rains and unreliable support prices, Suresh decided to grow ATM. Now he is assured of around Rs 50,000 per acre with the ATM fodder pre-sold to dairy farmers in his village.M Venkatesh, a farmer of E Kamballi village is an ATM fan too. ""Earlier, it was difficult to get fodder, especially in the summer.We used to import dried fodder from Andhra or Tamil Nadu which is not good for cattle,"" he said. It was also a costly affair, as each kilo of dry fodder costs Rs 10-15. Due to ATM initiative ,farmers like Venkatesh are now getting fresh fodder for less than half that amount.Dry fodder, according to Dr Chennakeshava, deputy director of animal husbandry, causes a lot of complications for cattle. ""Apart from causing blisters in their mouths, dry fodder results in kidney stones among cattle and reduces the quality and quantity of milk produced,"" he said.Dr Srinivas Gowda, deputy manager of KMF, said that since November 2016, the states Animal Husbandry Department and KMF have distributed almost 70,000 mini-kits of ATM seeds. He said agreements are being made with farmers to grow all the fodder that is required to feed cattle in the district. ""ATM fodder has increased the quantity of milk generated by two to three litres per animal, he added.Speaking to New Indian Express, Dr K V Thrilok Chandra, deputy commissioner of Kolar district, explained that such a project was essential, as 90 per cent of the 2.76 lakh heads of cattle in the district were milch cows. ""Since starting this project, the solid not fat (SNF) content of milk too has increased, making farmers eligible for incentives offered by the state government,""he said.Though there are several other projects to improve water availability, and others are being implemented in the district, the ATM project has impacted many people in a short period. Maintaining that Kolar is the first district where fodder cultivation is being taken up on a large scale, he said the model can be emulated elsewhere to ensure income security for farmers."

A wide range of mangoes, including those grown in the district and from other parts of the state and foreign countries, were on display. A stall by Central Horticultural Experiment Station, Hirehalli, has displayed varieties of jackfruit for tasting as well.The cardamom and black pepper vines developed by Appangala Spices Research Station was another attraction for the farmers. The officials said that bush pepper can be cultivated on the terrace of the house as well.The Forest department had kept the saplings of silver oak, wild jackfruit, balanji, bamboo, holemathi and shivani for display and sale. In addition, nutrients developed by the research centres for vegetables and flowers were on display. Machineries like sprinkler, pepper separating machine, tree cutter, homemade juice attracted the onlookers.Indian Horticultural Research Centre director Dr M R Dinesh told DH that there has been decline in the use of fruits in the recent past. India was producing 170 million tonne fruits annually in the past. This has increased to 284 million tonne in the last three years. However, the farmers do not have knowledge on marketing tactic. The growers should know the climatic condition in their area and then select the fruits for cultivation.The research centre has given priority to locally available mangoes. Appemidi trees are felled in Shivamogga, Sagar and Theerthahalli regions. We are making a study on the medicinal values of the produce. There has been discussion on introducing Appemidi in the modern market as well, he explained.Shyamala Shastri of Prakrithi Food Products said, A few individuals spoke lightly when I experimented on preparing juice from cashew apple.

In fact, ads have a two-way link with society. Firstly, ads reflect the prevailing social mores and preferences of the people.For example, the matrimonial ads in India at one time used to seek as groom in order of preference: doctors, engineers, chartered accountants and, as last resort, professors. Some were even more categorical in specifying that the brides family would consider only doctors having degrees from UK and engineers from IITs. Then, over time, with the rising flow of Indian IT professionals abroad, such people working in USA, and Europe began to occupy the pride of place in the list.For some families, apart from enjoying a better material standard of living, staying abroad had the further attraction that it would enable the bride to stay away from the in-laws family. More recently, with MBAs  particularly from the top IIMs  typically earning more than engineers, IIM MBAs have entered the list. Also, an increasing number of matrimonial ads are asking for working brides, instead of housewives, to supplement family income. At the same time, the proliferation of fairness cream ads testifies the premium that the Indian society, by and large, still places on fair skin.It is also interesting to observe how the products promoted by the ads have changed over time. With rising affluence (and aspirations) of the new generation along with easier availability of bank loans for consumer products, the ads for simple consumer goods like basic soaps, detergents and tooth pastes are giving way to more upscale products like body perfumes, air conditioners, motor bikes, cars, LED TVs, smartphones, jewellery, diamonds, flats and villas.Secondly, advertisers  through their ads and promotional campaigns  try to change the tastes, habits, choices and the aspirations of the public. They would make you believe that life is largely meaningless if you dont have a smart phone, shoes, watch, perfume, motorbike, car of a specific brand to distinguish you from the hoi polloi or to make a fashion statement for you.Advertisers particularly target children as, apart from being more impressionable, they are having an increasing say in family purchase decisions in todays society. In addition, investing in changing their preferences is likely to yield higher returns as their life span is longer.In this game of marketing and promotion, celebrities play a significant role. This is an age-old technique. Older people would remember seeing ads in newspapers and movie theatres (long before the advent of TVs) depicting film stars like Nargis or Madhubala using Lux soap every day. The same tradition is continuing, except that the range of products promoted by film stars and sports personalities has widened enormously. Even some state governments are employing such personalities as brand ambassadors for the purpose of attracting tourists or investments.Why do companies pay enormous sums to hire the services of such celebrities to promote their brands? There are two possible reasons. One, the face of a celebrity attracts the viewers attention immediately to the ad and the product stays in the mind of the viewer through association.Second, the fact that a company can afford to pay the huge sum to the celebrity implies that the product must be a good one bringing a lot of revenue. That helps establish the quality of the product in the minds of prospective buyers.Should celebrities be held accountable for the quality of the product or the service being advertised by them? True, it is not possible for an outsider to know fully about the quality (including any fraudulent claims made by the company).Product qualityYet, the celebrities  because of their celebrity status being used to sell the product or service to unsuspecting people  should exercise due diligence before endorsing. Since they are earning huge money, at least they should be made to pay some monetary penalty if they are found endorsing a product making false claims. That would make them more circumspect.Do companies have to spend on ads to survive? In theory, if the products being sold by different firms are identical in quality and consumers also think so, then it does not pay for any firm to spend on ads. Since the identical products would sell at the same price, the extra cost incurred on ads cannot be recovered.That is why we dont see ads for potatoes or tomatoes but find ads for different brands of potato chips and tomato ketchups (as these are not considered identical by consumers). At the other extreme, a monopolist  because he gets 100% market share by definition  cannot gain by spending on ads except when the ad helps expand the total market of the product by making more consumers aware of the product or an improved variety of the product or by enhancing the image of the company by advertising its CSR activities.Is so much spending on ad socially justified? Here a distinction needs to be made between ads to disseminate information and ads to take away sales from the competitors. The first type provides some useful service to the society. The second does not add any net social benefit. One firms gain is cancelled by another firms loss.While ads at tax payers expense aimed at changing social attitudes like open defecation, child marriage, demanding dowry etc are justified, wastage of national resources occurs when politicians use page-long ads to promote themselves under the pretext of informing the public about the laying of foundation stone for a project.If providing information is the objective, a simple press note in the media or a smaller ad without the names and photos of the numerous ministers and politicians should do.(The writer is former Professor of Economics, IIM-Calcutta)"

As per the recently published State Focus paper of Nabard, the entire produce which goes as waste has the potential for setting up of fruits and vegetable processing units.The major produce of the state, which is known as the fruit bowl of India, includes grapes, mangoes, pomegranates etc. The regions of Pune, Nashik, Satara Kolhapur, Sangli, etc are known for their extensive vegetable cultivation. Over all, the state has around 2 lakh hectares of vegetable cultivation. Nabards report says that about 70 per cent of fruits and 60 per cent of vegetables are consumed fresh in the state and hardly 1.2 per cent of fruits and vegetables are processed.Shriram Gadhve, president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India (VGAI), said the wastage of fruits and vegetables starts right from the field gate and continues till the retail market. Gadhve said that the lack of knowledge at the farmers end and the untrained market labours compound the wastage. Losses in transit are also encountered which often goes unaccounted for, he said. At the farmers end, Gadhve said, the lack of proper pricing hinders the adoption of proper handling techniques while at the market the labours employed are not trained properly in handling techniques.The usual practice for fruits and vegetable growers is to hire a vehicle to take their produce to the market from where it is unloaded and sold. Traders often cite lower prices to compensate for lower grade or wastage in the consignment. Gadhve said losses are more in case of soft vegetables like tomatoes and green leafy vegetables. The lack of storage or air-conditioned vans also contributed to the losses, he said.Gadhve said they had started awareness campaigns at the farmers end to educate them about proper handling and packing techniques. While this was welcomed by the farmers, the programme was difficult to scale up given the sheer magnitude of the work.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5928f0b87be9e0137c781bac,A pencil capsule with seeds to  grow saplings,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/603155/a-pencil-capsule-seeds-grow.html,2017-03-25,,Deccan Herald,"R Sathyanarayana in Chennai, March 26, 2017, DHNS 23:35 ISTMost schools in major cities are moving towards digitisation and expect children to use tablets to study. But ballpoint pen, pencil, eraser and notebooks continue to be part of their study. Students discard most materials after their academic year or when they are no more useable and go in for a new set.Now, thanks to the enterprising work by two computer science engineering graduates from Coimbatore district of Tamil Nadu, a pencil's stub can be grown into a sapling.S Ranjith Kumar and A Rajakamalesh had noticed that valuable pencil stubs were being thrown away. As pencils are biowaste, the duo started making efforts to effectively utilise them.The two have named their innovation Farmcil, a blend of farming and pencil. Farmcil, the name given to the pencil, grows into a plant, contributing to the preservation of ecology. The unique pencil has a capsule at one end containing seeds, Ranjith Kumar said.Ranjith Kumar said the name Farmcil for the pencil is to emphasise the importance of farming not only in the region but also throughout the nation and to preserve the green cover on earth.Ranjith Kumar said Our family and educational background were responsible for us to take up issues such as global warming and unbridled pollution, resulting in deteriorating quality of earth. These developments have been directly affecting people.In January 2016, we thought of working on this innovative idea. Thereafter, we started doing research on the project. We had detailed discussions with the professors in the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. It took a concrete shape in August 2016, Ranjith Kumar said.According to him, the wood used for the Farmcil is natural and free from any toxins since children tend to put the Farmcil in their mouths while writing. The capsule at the end of the pencil is made from non-toxic bio-material. Even if children chew the bottom of the Farmcil, it will not harm them. Once the Farmcil gets wet because of the saliva, it becomes sticky. Therefore, the child will not attempt to put the Farmcil in the mouth again, he said.The seeds in the Farmcil capsule are either of vegetables or flower-bearing plants. The seeds could be of tomato, brinjal, okra, chilli or cluster beans or verbena, zinnia, cockscomb, sunflower or balsam.Once the capsule dissolves, seed sprouts and grows into a plant. The process could take between three and 10 days, depending on the plant variety. The plant will yield flowers or vegetables in about 40 to 50 days.Students could use the Farmcil till it becomes short. Then, the remaining portion should be inserted sideways in the soil. Soil should be covered till planting mark. The Farmcil should not be planted deep inside. In addition, the soil in the pot should be loosely filled. After a few days, the capsule gets dissolved and begins to expose seeds. It is easy for a student to plant the Farmcil since it has the planting mark, Ranjith said.Sprouting depends on the seed. For example, tomato could take a week whereas for okra it could be just four days. Likewise, sprouting for chilli, brinjal, cluster beans and sun flower is between five days and one week. The student will have a choice of growing plant of his choice by buying the right Farmcil.Ranjith said that students would be thrilled to see plants with colourful flowers and green vegetables and they would have the satisfaction of nurturing them. Gardening slowly becomes a habit for children as they develop pride and sense of responsibility towards nature preservation, he said. The product is patented under the intellectual property rights law and the trade mark registration for this brand is under process.He said that Farmcil aims to drive home the importance of farming and ecology preservation. Also this concept inculcates the habit of nurturing nature in children when they start using Farmcils in their kindergarten classes, he pointed out. The habit is likely to stand children in good stead when they grow up.At present, the duo has started supplying the environmental-friendly Farmcils to various NGOs across Tamil Nadu. We have a product unit called R & R Trading Company that produces about 18,000 pencils per day, Ranjith said.In a bid to empower women, Ranjith's unit has employed only female staff in the packing section. We are in the process of introducing more vegetable and flower seeds. We have 10 types of seeds now, he said. The Farmcil is priced at Rs 10."

Representational Image.This summer, tomato prices might see a spike as tomato plantations in Maharashtra have seen a sharp drop in output. Lack of ready cash with growers and an infestation of white flies is being attributed to the drop, which has affected the entire state. As against the 34,500 hectares of plantation used to cultivate tomato during summer, this year the state has seen 31,012 hectares of farmland used for the crop. The dip in area is significant in the tomato-growing districts of Pune, Nashik, Satara and Sangli.Watch What Else Is Making NewsDeepak Bhise, president of the Tomato Growers Federation of Narayangaon in Junnar taluka of Pune district, claimed that demonetisation was to be blamed for the dip in cultivation area as farmers didnt have enough cash. Tomato is a cash-intensive crop as farmers require costly inputs on an average, an acre of crop would require Rs 70,000 as input cost, he said.Currently, demonetisation and a sharp fall in prices of almost all farm produces have shaken the economics of rural areas, making farmers wary of heavy investments. Bhise, who normally plants five acres of tomatoes, has only planted three acres of the crop this year. Another reason for lesser cultivation is the apparent infestation of white flies in tomato-growing areas. Increase in onion acreage in the last few years has increased the prevalence of white flies in these areas. This pest destroys tomato crop, so many farmers have not opted for tomato this season, he said.According to traders at the wholesale markets, lesser agricultural area for tomatoes would result in an increase in the price of the vegetable in the days to come.In June last year, tomato prices had crossed the Rs 70 per kg mark in retail markets in many parts of the state, as a severe drought had destroyed the rabi crop. This year, lesser cultivation may also result in a spike in prices.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Express File Photo Indian Agricultural Research Institutes library building in New Delhi. Express File PhotoIn about a months time, Indian farmers are going to harvest their wheat crop that will mark the 50th year of the Green Revolution. The 1966-67 rabi season was when they first undertook large-scale planting of the new miracle high-yielding varieties on some 2,40,000 hectares. Key to the revolution was the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), whose scientists developed the package of practices for cultivation of the semi-dwarf wheat lines, initially imported from Mexico before breeding their own improved varieties, starting with Sonalika and Kalyan Sona in 1967. That very IARI today is without a regular director. It has, in fact, been without one for a good part of over two-and-a-half years. The last director to have served a full term,H S Gupta, retired on August 7, 2014. It took more than a year to appoint a successor. But even the new director Trilochan Mohapatra, who joined on August 28, 2015  he previously headed the Central Rice Research Institute at Cuttack, Odisha  was around for barely six months. On February 22, 2016, Mohapatra became director-general of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). IARI has been headless since then.It reflects the neglect by the authorities of an institution that has contributed so much to our farmers. That this is happening when we are celebrating the golden jubilee of the Green Revolution makes it even more unfortunate, says Vijay Pal Singh, former programme leader (rice) at IARI and breeder of Pusa-1121, the blockbuster basmati variety that generates around $3 billion in annual export revenues for the country.From Kalyan Sona and Sonalika in the mid-sixties, IARI scientists went on to develop similarly successful wheat varieties such as HD-2285 (released for commercial cultivation in 1982), HD-2329 (1985), HD-2967 (2011) and HD-3086 (2014). While Kalyan Sona and Sonalika raised the wheat yield potential that many farmers harvested from 10-15 quintals to 45-50 quintals per hectare, these rose further to over 70 quintals with HD-2967 and HD-3086. The last two varieties would cover an estimated 14 million hectares or nearly half of the total area planted to wheat in India this year!But wheat apart, IARIs research fields have produced a host of widely-cultivated varieties also in rice (Pusa Basmati-1, Pusa-44, Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509), mustard (Pusa Bold, Pusa Jaikisan, Pusa Mustard-25, 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30), chana (BG-256 and BG-362), vegetables (Pusa Ruby tomato, Pusa Purple Long brinjal and Pusa Sawani okra), and mango (Mallika and Amrapali). More recent breakthroughs include Pusa Double Zero Mustard-31 (the first ever canola-grade mustard containing low levels of erucic acid and glucosinolates) and Pusa Arhar-16 (a promising early-maturing pigeon-pea that can yield 20 quintals per hectare in just 120 days and is, moreover, amenable to mechanical combine harvesting).Significantly, all this is from an institution with an annual budget of just over Rs 400 crore, which also covers salaries and other establishment expenses. There arent many research organisations in India that have had such a tangible impact on the ground with so little investment, claims Singh, whose breeding accomplishments in basmati rice won him the Padma Shri award in 2012. IARIs bane has been the overbearing control  on everything from administration and appointments to funding, travel and research collaboration approvals  imposed by ministers, bureaucrats and scientist-administrators sitting in Krishi Bhawan. Such direct involvement from the Agriculture Ministry may not have mattered during the Green Revolution period, when the person at the helm, Chidambaram Subramaniam, was somebody who knew the subject well and, equally important, had a direct line with the then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi.We were living ship-to-mouth those days and everybody recognised the importance of investing in agricultural research. A lot of attention was, therefore, paid to institutions such as IARI and it continued even in the decades that followed. No wonder, we had such illustrious directors, be it B P Pal, M S Swaminathan, A B Joshi, H K Jain and S K Sinha or R B Singh and S Nagarajan, notes Singh.According to him, things have changed in the last few years, when agriculture itself has ceased to be a priority amongst policymakers and we think we have become self-sufficient. That has bred not just complacency, but even negligence, manifested in Indias premier national institute for agricultural research and education not having a full-time director. The Indian Agricultural Research Institute currently has Jeet Singh Sandhu, deputy director-general (crop science) of ICAR, holding additional charge as its director. Prior to him, the officiating director was Ravinder Kaur, an agricultural physicist who heads IARIs water technology centre.The director of IARI should be someone with a good understanding of soil and water, besides biochemistry, genetics and breeding, plant pathology and entomology. I hope the government make the right choice and it is done soon. The present situation is sending a negative message to the younger generation of scientists, adds Singh.Many eminent farm scientists, both past and serving, The Indian Express spoke to felt that the time had come to insulate both IARI and its parent organisation ICAR from political/bureaucratic interference by bringing them under the direct charge of the Prime Minister. This is the case with the Indian Space Research Organisation, Department of Atomic Energy, and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. Transferring administrative authority from Krishi Bhawan to the Prime Ministers office will make ICAR/IARI less vulnerable to ministerial whims and day-to-day interference. Moreover, it will help raise the profile of agricultural research to the level of space and atomic energy, while protecting the autonomy of institutions like IARI, they point out.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5935518e7be9e061b1736557,Silk Road to Goa,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/silk-road-to-goa/articleshow/58723848.cms,2017-05-18,,The Times Of India,"At the risk of losing out on a historic opportunity , India stands virtually alone in boycotting China's extraordinarily ambitious 'One Belt , One Road' (OBOR) logistics project to re-energize the millennia-old Silk Road's trading corridors, which once dominated global commerce. The Chinese plan is gargantuan and complex, with multiple linkages throughout Eurasia and across the Indian Ocean. There is a 'New Silk Road Economic Belt' of land connections and a 'Maritime Silk Road' comprising sea routes. It is the latter that holds particularly immense promise for Goa, if India conquers its doubts and joins the network.With OBOR, China's aspirations span the globe. Over 60 countries will be involved, committing the participation of two-thirds of the world's population, 55% of the global GDP and 75% of global energy reserves. Nine hundred infrastructure projects will come under this umbrella, involving at least $1.3 trillion in direct investment from state-controlled institutions led by Beijing. While several countries (including India) are wary of this forceful international push, seeing it as a bold Chinese initiative to rewrite the geo-strategic status quo, the Communist Party leadership has repeatedly declared its intentions are benign. President Xi Jinping says, ""What we hope to create is a big family of harmonious coexistence.""There are legitimate concerns for India that underlie its reluctance to embrace OBOR. Relations between the Modi and Xi administrations are poor and deteriorating. Beijing blocked India's bid to enter the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the crucial global cartel for nuclear trade. At the United Nations, China stymied India's latest attempt to sanction Masood Azhar of Jaish-e-Mohammed. Last month, the Dalai Lama was allowed to visit Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh, which the Chinese foreign ministry called ""severe damage on the China-India relationship.""Still, these minor irritants should not distract from the overwhelming historic logic for much closer ties between India and China. The two ancient civilizations flourished in harmonious contact with each other for thousands of years. Half-Kashmiri and half-Uighur scholar Kumarajiva revived Buddhism in China. During his service as national teacher under the 5th century emperor Yao Xing, 90% of the population converted to Buddhism. Throughout the intervening centuries, caravanserai from the Far East to Central Asia passed via India with goods to trade at every stop. The 14th century admiral Zheng He repeatedly travelled to India with his armada of the largest ships in the world.Goa has 'One Belt, One Road' logic embedded in its DNA. This insignificantly tiny riparian territory has nonetheless repeatedly stood centrepiece of a web of vital maritime connections. The Kadamba kings welcomed traders from across the Indian ocean and once appointed an Arab chief minister. Adil Shah's reign was even more cosmopolitan. Then, after 1510, Alfonso de Albuquerque's spectacular seizure of the entire sea routes of the Indian ocean comprehensively rewrote global economic history, with Goa as its most valuable hub.To the extent accurate historical analogies exist to China's OBOR, they come from the colonial past. British, French, Dutch and Portuguese empires all linked distant points of the globe together, with drastic and consequential results. At one point, it was accurately said ""the sun never sets on the British empire"" because so much of the world's territory was controlled from London. France also extended to South America and the South Pacific along with Africa and Asia. Before them all, however, it was the Portuguese who created the blueprint, and no spot on the planet better reflects the impact of global linkages than Goa.In social sciences, ""the law of unintended consequences"" predicts unforeseen developments and circumstances will blindside any purposeful action. This is what happened in the breakneck chaos of 16th century globalization. The tiny port city of Goa exploded to twice the population of London and Paris combined. In the area of food habits alone India transformed forever  chillies, corn, potatoes and tomatoes entered the subcontinent for the first time. And because roads run in both directions, the rest of the world transformed too  products, ideas and techniques flowed out from the subcontinent, from Goa, directly to Europe, to South East Asia and China, and all the way to Brazil. Within a short time, the Portuguese had lost control. Everything that followed was unpredictable and unplanned, and Goans benefited more than most.The 21st century's information age ensures fewer surprises lurk than during the Age of Discoveries. But the basic principles of increased openness remain. Everything flows in both directions. You cannot predict the winners, and it is also possible that everyone will win. This is the underlying message of Goa's history, with lasting value for every other part of the world. With all due caution, India must find a way to participate in China's hugely important revitalization of the ancient trade routes. They served the subcontinent very well for much of history, and can do so again.The writer is a photographer and widely published columnist. Views expressed are his own"

With the harvest of shallots , like that of other vegetables, hit by the drought , the price of the vegetable has shot up by almost 150% in the past two months. With a kilo of shallots now costing almost Rs 100 per kg, households which used the vegetable generously are forced to rework their food budgets.Ironically, the price of big onions has been slowly but constantly dropping. Vegetable vendors attribute it to the arrival of excess stocks from Pune.Shallots, that is an essential part of many south Indian dishes like sambar, poriyal, bhajjis and other non-vegetarian dishes, used to cost as less as Rs 25 per kg three months ago; it now costs Rs 100 per kg. ""The price went up to Rs 40 in March. From then, it increased to Rs 70 by mid-April and Rs 90 in the beginning of May,"" said G A Wahab, secretary of the traders association and president of the Saibaba Colony Vegetable Vendors Association. ""The wholesale rate for the vegetable itself is Rs 90 per kg,"" he said. ""This is mainly due to a shortfall in supply of the vegetable. We don't know if farmers are hoarding it, or if there genuinely is such a big drop in harvest,"" he added.Shallot farmers admit there is a shortfall in the supply cycle, but attribute it to a combination of factors, including the drought and very low prices for the vegetable last year. ""Last year, shallots fetched hardly Rs 15 to Rs 20 per kg, and even that did not find buyers,"" said a farmer, T Kadhiresan. ""So, almost two-thirds of the shallot farmers opted to cultivate other vegetables like beans, spinach and tomato,"" he said. ""While that itself reduced the price, the drought like conditions and the climate reduced the yield by less than half,"" he said. ""Shallots need a lot of mist and no heat during its growing stages, but without that last year the yield dropped from the usual five tonnes an acre to two tonnes an acre,"" he added.With the prices likely to remain high, many housewives have begun reworking their budgets. ""I used to spend Rs 500 a week for vegetables, but now it has gone upto Rs 650,"" complained Aashrita Kanwal, a resident of Saibaba Colony. ""Besides this, I have also begun reducing my usage of shallots and am using onions instead,"" she said.That seems to be the way forward because onion prices have begun dropping. While the vegetable costs Rs 9 in the wholesale market, it costs Rs 12 to Rs 20 in the retail market. ""It has dropped by 0.50 p to Rs 2 per kg, because stocks from Pune have begun pouring in,"" said Wahab."

However, on Friday - the last day of the census - his disappointment gave way to elation, when he spotted a herd of five elephants, which included a calf during the waterhole count.As part of the waterhole count conducted on the last day of the census, volunteers and resource personnel sit near a water hole, waiting for the elephants to assemble at the spot. While the sight of an elephant herd was a source of great delight for volunteers, Madappa M, a farmer of Hosa Birwalu village in HD Kote taluk, less than a kilometre from the park, watched them pass with trepidation. Madappa and members of his family fervently hope not to see any elephants, particularly near their field s where they have sown cotton.Madappa said that, the elephants trampled on the crops within two months of the seeds being sown. ""Elephants invading our fields is not new to us. But the problem has become serious over the years. They used to come into the fields once in a while, and feed on crops such as paddy and sugarcane. Lately, they don't spare any crops,"" Madappa added. Farmers living and working in villages on the periphery of Bandipur National Park share Madappa's concerns. As the three-day census operation came to an end on Friday, the threat that the tuskers posed to the livelihood of the farmers gave the volunteers much to ponder about. Tackling the humanelephant conflict has become a huge challenge for the forest department.While farmers in HD Kote taluk have traditionally cultivated paddy and sugarcane, they have started growing crops such as tomato, chilly, cauliflower and cotton in the recent years.Mallesha N of Badagalapura , another village lying close to the forest boundary, has tried several measures - from erecting a solar fence to changing the crop pattern -to keep elephants at bay. Blaming the forest department for its failure to restrict elephant movement, he said,""They don't allow us to graze our cattle inside the forest. They better keep the wild animals inside the woods."" Assistant conservator of forests for Hediyala sub-division that falls under Bandipur, Paramesh hoped that the forest department would be able to use the census data to combat the problem.""We're doing our best now.Trenches have been dug near the boundary, and night patrolling too has increased. We have also ensured farmers are compensated quickly for the crop loss. We're holding community meetings to increase awareness among villagers on the importance of wildlife,"" he added."

The ungodly hour on the second Sunday of May does not deter them from singing and sharing jokes as they prepare for one of Goa's quaint tribute to seafood and the tradition of fishing.Nerul is a small fishing hamlet famous for being surrounded by the Sinquerim river and the beautiful palm -fringed Coco beach. Situated opposite the state capital Panaji on the northern bank of River Mandovi, Nerul shares borders with the historic village of Verem-Reis Magos, where the famed Tisreachem Fest is also celebrated, albeit in a smaller way.Tisreachem Fest or the feast of clams is a community celebration that is held once a year at the tiny chapel of St Anthony in Bhattier vaddo of Nerul. Interestingly, the feast is also celebrated at Dandadi vaddo and Fortavaddo, indicating that the culinary celebration has nothing to do with a specific date.As the village wakes up, each home pulsates with activity. Residents scramble to open clams and prepare the ingredients as fast as possible so that the Sunday Eucharist at the Our Lady of Remedies Church is not missed.""There is no specific day for the feast and Tisreachem fest is not associated with any Christian or religious feast. There is no religious significance to it. It is just a chance for the community to come together,"" Nerul parish priest Fr Bolmax Fidelis Pereira says.While there is no religious significance behind the tradition, Nerul's idyllic surroundings have a lot to do with the feast. The nearby creek and the cove at the mouth of the River Mandovi was a thriving location for clams and mussels and the villagers, most of whom were fisherfolk, soon took to collecting the tisreos (clams), and shinaneo (mussels) and the village soon gained popularity in Bardez.Tisreos used to be collected in large numbers and distributedin the early days. ""This is a tradition that pre-dates the Portuguese rule. Nerul and Verem were known for a rich harvest of Tisreo and since the locals were mainly fishermen they decided to dedicate a day of thanksgiving for the abundance of tisreo,"" heritage activist and historian Prajal Sakhardande explains.Another unique facet of the Tisreachem Fest is that it showcases the communitarian and secular fabric of Goa. This age-old tradition, over centuries, continues to be celebrated with equal gusto by both Hindus and Christians.Once the Eucharist is over, the Catholics join their village brethren at a common place to continue the cooking. And cooking for Tisreachem Fest translates into the sambaracheo tisreo (a tasty delicacy prepared from tisreo) or tisreo xacuti.While the women busy themselves with large quantities of shellfish and coconut grating, the men chip in by chopping large quantities of onions, chillies and tomatoes. The kids are left to run errands or to purchase missed out ingredients.Apart from the few mansions and resorts built in Nerul, the village still retains its original charm, relatively untouched by modern tourism. There is still a strong fishing community and the villagers also grow watermelons, ground nut, rice and vegetables.""This feast is celebrated in other villages also, but not on as big a scale as in Nerul. It was started by the village forefathers and we continue this tradition. One of the reasons why this festival is celebrated in May is because many people used to come down to the coast for the summer and this became a celebration,"" Nerul sarpanch Shashikala Govekar explains.According to the local tradition, each feast has an appointed president in whose house the sambaracheo tisreo curry is prepared. Continuing the age-old tradition of giving thanks for God's blessings, the president or host of the feast offers the banquet of clams as a personal thanksgiving.""The feast has to be booked one-year in advance. The tradition of this feast has been going on for generations. In the olden days, the tisreo were served in bowls made out of banyan leaves, but we have switched over to ready made silver foil bowls. There is also a tradition of serving mangoes or jackfruit along with the tisreo,"" local resident David D'Souza, who hosted the Tisreachem Fest last May said."

We blame it on the spicy food, the fried stuff and the late night shenanigans. But we never seem to go down to the basics of understanding why till it becomes a frequently repetitive situation or gets so chronic that family members may have to rush you to the hospital suspecting a heart attack.Acidity occurs when the basic PH balance of our stomach remains acidic over larger periods of time, upsetting the tender linings of our stomach. In certain cases a stomach abnormality called hiatal hernia can cause acid reflux. This happens when the stomach acid is thrown back into the esophagus because of the partial closing or failing of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). If one is overweight then the diaphragm which is the muscle that separates your stomach from your chest is pushed upwards causing the LES to be stressed open.As we grow older, if one leads a sedentary lifestyle its not just your outer muscles but even the internal organs that slowly lose their tenacity and the LES can become weak as with the other sphincters and valves throughout your body.The stomach naturally produces HCl (Hydrochloric acid) to help with the digestion of food and has a higher acidic level than rest of the body (between to 2 to 5.5 as compared with 7.45 of rest of the body). The stomach also produces mucus at the same time which acts as a lining to protect its inner walls against the action of HCl.The HCl is required to kill bacteria that enters the body through food, and also to activate enzyme pepsin that helps in the breakdown of proteins in the stomach and the enzyme, Intrinsic factor that absorbs B12. Pepsin can only work in an acidic environment. If the food sits in the stomach for a longer period of time then the chances of increased acid levels can cause gases to be formed which in turn can result in bloating, burping, nausea, and heartburn due to acid reflux. Eating too much food can pressurize the stomach. Eating too high alkaline foods can cause more stomach acid to be produced to enable digestion, so balancing your meals are very important.Carbohydrates move quickly through the stomach, while proteins take longer and fats can sit in your stomach for almost 6 hours.While choosing your meals we should make sure we combine our food in such a way where we can get the maximum absorption of proteins while the carbs and fiber bind them while maintaining a good insulin balance. Fats should be preferably the unsaturated ones that go smoothly through the stomach till they are emulsified with bile in the small intestine to aid in absorption of the fat soluble vitamins, A,D,E and K.High alkaline foods are : Cabbage, broccoli, cucumber, avocado, spinach, kale, beets, celery, onion, tomato, garlic, carrot, almonds, coconut, pomegranate, olives, chickpeas, sprouted moong, soy.High acidic foods are : Meat (red meat as well as chicken, duck, turkey), eggs, Dairy (cheese, milk), oils, butter, cashews, peanuts, white rice, honey, jams, vinegar, mustard, cocoa, tea, coffee, alcohol, sweets, chocolate, fruit juices, and any food with preservatives.The rest of the foods fall into the medium category which we can incorporate into our everyday diets, in moderation ofcourse. However, it is very essential that when we have too much of either one of the high acidic or high alkaline foods we balance it with the other.Acidity should not be counteracted with anti acidity medicines over a prolonged time as they can inhibit your bodys absorption of essential nutrients. Make it a point therefore to eat well balanced, proportionate meals. Smaller meals that do not stay in the stomach too long, keep hydrating yourself in between the meals to make sure the stomach acids do not hurt the sensitive mucus linings of your inner walls.Eat before you are hungry and stop before you are full."

Data shows that almost 50% of the land in the district under fruits, spices, vegetables and flower cultivation is drip irrigated. In 2016-2017, 36,539 hectares of horticulture crops were cultivated in the district against cultivation on 39,000 hectares in the previous financial year. While the acreage under fruits, spices and flowers has come down in the district, the area under vegetable cultivation has actually increased by 600 hectares. So acreage wise, we do not see much of a difference from the previous year yet, said the deputy director of horticulture, A Ramakrishnan. But the cultivation this year has witnessed a noticeable drop when compared to that in 2014-2015 -when we had good rains, he said.While acreage under crops like banana, turmeric and tomato has fallen by 200 hectares to 300 hectares, area under onions has gone up. Banana and turmeric are long-term crops that require more water and so does tomato to give a good yield. Thus, many farmers have turned to vegetables like onions, chillies and ladys finger which are less fleshy and require less water, said Ramakrishnan.The area under plantation crops too has increased by 1,000 hectares, mainly because cocoa inter-crop plantations were also taken into ac count. Officials attribute the farm ers confidence to cultivate even in the face of such a severe drought, to drip irrigation. In the district, only farmers with assured water and ir rigation facilities bother cultivating their land. They stopped completely relying on rainfall many years ago, said Vasanthi Gnanasekharan, as sistant director of horticulture de partment, Thondamuthur block.In our district, if you remove the 15,000 hectares of plantation crops like tea, coffee, banana and cocoa from the equation, at least 50% of the remaining 21,000 hectares of cultivable land are drip irrigated, said Ramakrishnan. Drip irrigation becomes critical during drought situations, because with one large tank of water, we can add the required fertilizer and water almost five acres for four days, said A Veeramani, a chilly farm er in Madukkarai. In normal situa tions, the water stock would get over in a day or two, and will not cover the entire five acres, he said.The horticulture department now targets getting the entire area under fruit, vegetable and spice cultivation in the district under drip irrigation with in the next five years. We hope to achieve our targets within three years or maximum five years, said Ram akrishnan."

The thyroid gland located at the Adams Apple near your throat, is what produces hormones that activate cell activity by controlling your bodys temperature and the rate that your body burns calories.Our brain produces TSH (magnesium, B-12, zinc and protein are required to produce this) which travels to your thyroid gland and tells your thyroid gland to produce T4. (To produce that we need iodine Vitamin B5 and Vitamin C). Through the blood stream carries T4 and when it gets to the tissues it is converted into T3 (Selenium and glutathione is required for this conversion) which is the active form of thyroid hormone which gets inside of your cells nucleus to do all the work. The little tiny key hole on the surface of the cell is called the nuclear receptor where the thyroid hormone binds with the (This binding requires Vitamin A ad Vitamin D) which is what increases your metabolism.Hypothyroidism means too less of T4 and T3 being produced which will cause people to experience energy loss, weight gain, hair loss, dry skin, elevated cholesterol, constipation. So what are the foods that we can use to combat this situation in other words to facilitate the production of T4 and T3. Listed below are the best foods rich in the nutrients according to each particular task.The required intake of magnesium, B-12, zinc and protein can be got from;Dairy products such as milk, yogurt, curds, cheese etc Eggs Meat Pulses and Legumes Nuts and seedsThe required intake of Iodine can be got from;Wheatgrass Spirulina Seafood SaltThe required intake of Vitamin B5 and Vitamin C can be got from;Oats Tomatoes Potatoes Citrus fruits BroccoliThe required intake of Selenium and glutathione can be got from;Brazil nuts Milk FishThe required intake of Vitamin A and Vitamin D can be got from;Eggs Mushrooms FishMost of these are regular foods that we can easily incorporate into our daily diet. Including these foods might be the key to stabilizing the thyroid affecting your metabolism.Claims of goiterogenic vegetables of the Brassica family such as Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage and even greens such as spinach and kale, affecting the thyroid negatively are only based on conclusions that the goiterogens will block the absorption of iodine which is one of the key agents of optimum thyroid function. However one will have to eat them raw and in too large and amount for that to happen. Meanwhile if we give up on eating these veggies, we might be barring ourselves from getting lots more nutritional benefits. So, unless there is a specified clinical observation from your doctor dont disbar yourself from these veggies having high nutritional content.To re-activate your metabolism, you need to energize yourself with correct food intake and proper exercise. Smaller meals with consistent balance of carbs and protein, will help you reboot during the day. Divide your activity evenly during the day, so it keeps your food to energy conversion and carbs utility in a cycle. Remember that the key here is consistency, once the body gets used to the cycle, you will see a difference in your health too. Heal naturally."

5937b6727be9e015d564c98e,Note ban ‘most terrible’ decision of Modi Government: Chidambaram,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/note-ban-most-terrible-decision-of-modi-government-chidambaram/,2017-02-09,,Indian Express,"Congress leader and former Union Finance Minister P Chidambaram. (File photo) Congress leader and former Union Finance Minister P Chidambaram. (File photo)Opposition in Rajya Sabha today tore into the government for presenting a disappointing budget, with Congress leader P Chidambaram terming note ban as the most terrible decision and alleging that graft and black money have continued to thrive and large sections adversely affected. The former Finance Minister also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the words he chose to attack his predecessor Manmohan Singh, saying he should remember that the Chair he sat on was used by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and even Atal Bihari Vajpayee and hence he should use right language. Initiating the discussion on the 2017-18 General Budget, he accused the government of fumbling, bumbling, scrambling and inventing a new narrative every day. Observing that he saw his first Rs 2,000 note four days after it came into circulation, he said there were many who were caught with crores worth new notes stashed away. This is the biggest scam of 2016  Where did they get these notes from? Did these go directly from the RBI press to them, Chidambaram asked.This means that corruption and black money have thrived after demonetisation The NSSO says 15 crore people in this country are daily wage earners. 25.5 crore workers are daily income earners. 40 crore people were completely devastated by demonetisation for eight weeks. These 40 crore people may forgive you, but they wont forget the experience, he said.Questioning the remonetisation process, he asked why should you demonetise and then remonetise and said that the government has replenished Rs 9 lakh crore worth of new currency notes as against Rs 17 lakh crore old notes that went out of circulation.Chidambaram said the government had inherited an economy that, in the last two years of the UPA rule, had grown by 6.1 and 6.9 per cent respectively.The average for the 10-year period is 7.5 per cent. India is among the fastest growing large economies in the world. But through 2016-17, you made a series of mistakes, capped by the most terrible mistake, he said pointing at demonetisation.He also asked why was the government shying away from giving a GDP number even while giving an estimate.Terming the budget as a great disappointment, he estimated that 2016-17 will see a hit on GDP by 1-1.5 per cent and if very unlucky, then even 2 per cent and warned that this trend will spill over into 2017-18 also.In an economy that has admittedly slowed down, your Budget contracts government expenditure, Chidambaram said, adding that even in the budget, capital expenditure has been curtailed.You shifted money from defence research and added it to defence capital, he said, pointing to the allocation of Rs 86,484 crore and adding that if the money for research was subtracted, then the actual defence outlay will be much less.The Congress leader noted that the revised estimate came to over Rs 71,000 which meant that either you are unable to spend the money, or you dont have the money to spend.Allocation as a percentage of the GDP has only come down, Chidambaram said as he read out allocation figures of the last three budgets including that of 2016-17.To give a boost to the economy, we have to spend more. This is Economics 101, he said, adding that the economy will suffer because of contracted expenditure.He then spoke about the bull-taming sport of Jallikattu and said the protest over it in Tamil Nadu was only a symbol under which people converged. The most vocal angst is about jobs. There are simply no jobs being created and jobs have been taken away, he said, adding this is the angst that brought young people to the Marina (beach in Chennai).Quoting figures, the Congress leader said 75 per cent of all small and medium industries are closed and then went ahead to state that these figures were as per your (affiliate) trade union, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh.Everybody has different concerns. Some are concerned about intolerance  ban jeans, ban books, ban authors, ban beef We have to find jobs for both the uneducated and the educated, Chidambaram said.Addressing the ruling BJP members, he asked them to tell him one strategy in the Budget which will create jobs. On the contrary, you have destroyed jobs. This is a powder keg. All it requires is a spark. I would like to caution the government, he said.Speaking about farmers, he said the Minimum Support Price gave an indication that agriculture is a viable vocation and farmers should continue as the government was there to take care of them.But there is nothing in the Budget speech about MSP, he said adding that a wrong message was being sent to farmers.Why are you not giving meaningful increases that take note of inflation in your MSP? I am saying I need money to educate my child. I need money to start a small business for my son. I need money to conduct the marriage of my daughter.And you are giving me money to conduct my funeral. Is this the way to treat farmers of this country, he said referring to Fasal Bima Yojana.Observing that the government withdrew 86 per cent of currency overnight, Chidambaram spoke of a large number of ATMs still not functioning.He referred to a village in the national capital territoty which was declared as the first digital village in the region and said you go there and the people ask What digital? It is very difficult to get away with a lie. The best way to do so is to utter the biggest lie.Taking a dig at the government, Chidamabaram said RBI officials are busy counting the notes physically. You speak about digitisation. First, teach that to the RBI. Every rupee has come back, except in Bhutan, Nepal and NRIs, whose money cant come now, because you breached your promise to them.He also asked if Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes are the cause of such major ills, how does Rs 2,000 note put an end to it. If 10 per cent of bank officials were dishonest earlier, now youve made all bank officials dishonest.It has now become easier for people used to carrying briefcases of notes as they will have to carry a smaller brief case, he said wryly.Chidambaram gaves examples of countries which still uses cash including the US, Autralia and Austria.A young lady wants to buy lingerie. Why should there be a record? A young couple wants to take a secret holiday. Why should that be recorded? I want to give money to my daughter-in-law for her expenses without the knowledge of my son. Why should there be a record? An adult wants to buy adult diapers.Why should there be a record of that?There are serious issues of privacy are involved which are respected in any democracy, he said, adding that people cant be told to go to the village fair and buy potatoes and tomatoes for Rs 7.50 and use credit cards.Dont even try to defend demonetisation. At least spare us the ignominy of listening to this defence, he said.Maintaining that the budget has been a great disappointment, he said there is no overarching vision and goal. It has no strategy. By cutting expenditure, youve shown that your government has no empathy for the poor. Government must lean towards the poor. After all this, what have you achieved? You cant achieve your fiscal goal of 3 per cent. This Budget is a demonstrable failure of economic management.Talking about RBIs decision not to cut policy rate, Chidambaram said it shows the Budget has no credibility.RBI does not believe your numbers. The Governor has said they are moving from an accommodative position to a neutral position. He has no faith in the story that you are projecting. All bank chairpersons, who ordinarily sing the RBIs praises say there is no room to cut the lending rate. How will investment take place then? Capital is flowing out, investment intentions are declining, credit growth to industry is negative  how is your industry going to grow?For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Reuters) A worker holds an iceberg lettuce as he leaves a lettuce plantation in Pulpi, near Almeria, southeast Spain. (Source: Reuters)A shortage of iceberg lettuce is likely to continue into March, Spanish farmers say, because freak weather conditions in the south of the country early in the agricultural year prevented the planting of seedlings to replace ruined crops. The southern region of Murcia, where most Spanish lettuce grown for export is cultivated, suffered the worst floods in two decades followed by its first snow storm in over 30 years in December and January.Watch What Else Is Making NewsThis has been extraordinary, its not normal to have so many problems at once, said Jose Antonio Canovas, a farmer and salesman in Murcia for Kernel Export, which grows, packages and delivers a range of vegetables from cauliflower to broccoli.The ruined harvest and subsequent shortage of produce has led some British supermarkets like Tesco and Sainsbury to ration iceberg lettuces to three per visit. The limited supply follows a shortage of courgettes in Britain and supplies of broccoli and aubergines have also been affected.Vegetable production in the European Union has fallen to 60 percent of normal levels in recent weeks due to bad weather affecting producers across the Mediterranean, from Greece to Spain, Spanish exporters say. Spain accounts for around half of EU vegetable exports.Not only did floods and snow ruin crops, leaving lettuces ready for harvest withered and battered in the fields, but the bad weather prevented the planting of polytunnel-grown seedlings which meant more delays to the next harvest of Spains biggest fruit and vegetable export after tomatoes.We have notified our customers that there may be production delays in March because the planting of seedlings has been delayed and in the rush to supply the market some crops were picked ahead of time, said Fernando Gomez, general manager of The Murcian Federation of Producers and Exporters of Fruit and Vegetables (Proexport).The production of lettuces, one of the most badly affected crops, has fallen by up to a third in the peak winter months of production when Spain harvests over 100,000 tonnes of the 700,000 tonnes it exports annually.Production is likely to return to normal by the end of March or the beginning of April, Proexports Gomez said.Many farmers in the area do not insure their crops. In a sector with very slim profit margins of between 1.5 and 4 percent, profit relies on big volumes. Higher prices have not made up for the losses farmers have suffered.Alongside the hit from ruined crops, the hiring of specialised labour to work the flooded and frozen fields has also eaten into profit margins at farms.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

On March 6, members and supporters of Nikhil Bharat Bangali Udbastu Samanway Samitee (Nibbuss) attacked the All Assam Students' Union (AASU) office, with a ripple effect. Normalcy is yet to return. The administration had yesterday relaxed curfew for two hours to let people buy essential commodities, whose scarcity was such that tomato was being sold at Rs 50 per kg. As no fresh incident was reported last night, the administration decided to relax curfew from 11am to 3pm today to enable people to enjoy Holi. For a few hours residents of the town immersed in the spirit of Holi by smearing colours on each other. ""It looks like Holi has brought victory over evil. We are enjoying the occasion to the fullest,"" said Chand Ratan Chandak, a resident. ""We are happy to enjoy Holi although it is for a very short time. We are also praying for the return of peace in the town,"" said Shankar Mech. The agitating organisations, in a meeting yesterday, decided to let businessmen open their establishments, barring the 143 shops that had downed shutters reportedly to attend the meeting organised by Nibbuss. The organisations also decided to request the businessmen to stay away from anti-Assamese activities. Today, most of the shops in the market were open. They were thronged by many as people could not buy essential items yesterday. In another breakthrough, based on information provided by Bengali organisations, Dhemaji police and the army arrested Nibbuss's national organising secretary Binoy Biswas, 54, at 2.30am today from Dharmapur village, 25km from Silapathar. Biswas was found in the house of Sorbeswar Das, 45, who was also arrested. Biswas, who hails from Natun Birpur under Betua Dohori police station in West Bengal, has identified himself as an advocate of Calcutta High Court. He was one among the 21 people against whom AASU had lodged an FIR at Silapathar police station. Sanjay Das, the Dhemaji district general secretary of Nibbuss, was also arrested today. With this, the total number of arrested persons in connection with the March 6 attack has gone up to 43 while the number of persons detained for violating curfew has gone up to 111. The Dhemaji district unit of AASU today declared March 6 as a ""black day"" for Assam and the Assamese community. It said the ""failure"" of the state government to arrest Subodh Biswas, the ""main accused"", has created suspicion among them that the government was deliberately not arresting Biswas for fear that it would reveal his alleged links with the BJP and RSS. Additional director-general of Assam police Mukesh Agarwal, who is monitoring the situation, told The Telegraph: ""The situation is under control now. Today, we relaxed curfew for four hours. The duration will be increased gradually to bring normalcy."""

Using this technique, one can convert building rooftops to vegetable-production bases. This can enable cities to have more green buildings with a sustainable healthy vegetable production,"" said Praveen Sharma of Flora Consult.""This is white-collar agriculture,"" Sharma said. ""Farming of the future. One need not dirty one's hands, remove grass, uproot or plant. We do not plant, under aeroponics. We just place the seedling,"" he said.Sharma learnt the technique on foreign assignments in Saudi Arabia and Africa, in 1986 and 1991 respectively, where he got a chance to work with Israeli and Dutch experts.The aeroponic system, according to Sharma, provides for a clean, efficient, and rapid production of food.The system uses two main modules of growing  vertical and linear. ""In the vertical system, one can grow 60 plants in just one square metre, as compared to just 8-10 plants in traditional hydroponics. The growing is done in specially designed towers,"" said Sharma, adding that a project of aeroponics technique consumes just 10% of water compared to field grown crops."

The farmers are not at all involved in violence, its anti-social elements and certain vested interests who are behind the violence, said Chouhan. He also stressed on the need for the government to purchase agricultural produce at more cost whenever the market prices go down. The CM announced that a Price Stabilisation Fund of Rs 1,000 crore is being set up for this.While maintaining that a bumper onion crop had triggered price crash, Chouhan said the government has decided to purchase onions from farmers at Rs 8 per kg. The process has already begun in Indore, Ujjain and Mandsaur districts. Also, it has been decided to purchase moong and toor pulses at Rs 5,500 and Rs 5,050 per quintal.While the RSS-affiliated Bhartiya Kisan Sangh had called off the stir following a meeting with the CM on Sunday, other bodies like Bhartiya Kisan Union and Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh are yet to call of the 10-day long protest.Why are the two states facing trouble?Farmers from the drought-hit states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh have taken to the streets in the last few days.

But a section of farmers outfits is not happy and want loans of all 1.34 crore farmers in the state to be written off. The demand is supported by Opposition parties and the BJPs main ally, the Shiv Sena. Significantly, two influential farmers outfits, the late Sharad Joshi-founded Shetkari Sanghatana and MP Raju Shetti-led Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, have decided to jump into the agitation. Shetti is an ally of the BJP. A 21-member core committee of prominent farmers leaders in the state has been formed, which will be meeting on June 8 in Nashik to decide on a future course of the agitation.Anticipating trouble and in the backdrop of the violence in neighbouring MP on a same issue, the state governments orders that prohibit five or more people from assembling at a spot will remain in effect till June 16 in Pune, June 17 in Kolhapur and June 19 in Nashik.In Mumbai, the vegetable markets received regular supply and prices stablised on Tuesday. The rates of tomato dipped to Rs40 a dozen, while cauliflower was priced at Rs 60 a kilogram. Fruits like chikoo dipped to Rs40 a dozen from Rs120 a dozen when the strike was at its peak on Friday.In a significant development, NCP chief Sharad Pawar called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi apparently to seek his attention to the farmers agitation in Maharashtra. According to reports, Modi told Pawar that Fadnavis would take a call on loan waiver.Significantly, state governments hopes to get any assistance from the Centre to write off farmers loans suffered a setback as union urban development minister M Venkaiah Naidu, who was in Mumbai on Tuesday, categorically ruled out any loan waiver package or aid by the Centre to the state for the purpose. Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have announced loan waivers on their own and Maharashtra will have to follow the same, Naidu told reporters.In the backdrop of the agitations, Fadnavis met BJPs ministers late on Tuesday. The meeting was held to review the BJPs recently undertaken farmer outreach campaign Shivar Samwad (Dialogue with Farmers) across nearly 43,000 villages in Maharashtra, at his official residence Varsha. The review comes ahead of party president Amit Shahs visit to Maharashtra as a part of his all India 95-day campaign tour to review organisational strengths of the BJP across all states, on June 16, 17 and 18."

It has been the second year of a bumper onion crop with no buyers, forcing the government to announce a belated decision to procure the onions for Rs 8 per kilogram.Farmers are angry because the government neither made arrangements to procure the crop on time nor intervened to ensure a reasonable price. They threw onions on roads given the prices of the vegetables plummeted to as low as Re 1 to Rs 2 per kg in certain markets, especially in the Malwa region, last year. This year too, farmers had to sell their winter crop  tomato and potato  at throwaway prices, bearing heavy loss.The distress is visible in the suicide numbers. From February 2016 to mid-February 2017, 1,982 farmers and farm labourers reportedly committed suicide, which was one-fifth of the total suicides in the state, where 21,000 farmers have taken their lives in 16 years.The National Crime Records Bureau attributed the reasons to crop failure, failure to sell produce, inability to repay loans, and other non-agriculture factors such as poverty and property disputes.The farmers should have been affluent if 20% growth figure given by the government is to be believed, said former state agriculture director GS Kaushal. But, he said, the reality was that input costs were rising and government failed to ensure remunerative price.MP farmer agitation: How the crisis unfolded June 1: Farmers begin a ten-day-long agitation in Madhya Pradesh demanding better price for their produce June 4: Clashes break out between police and farmers in Sehore, Indore and Bhopal districts, leaving six policemen injured June 4 afternoon: A delegation of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), which is affiliated to saffron parivar, defers farmers agitation following a meeting with chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in Ujjain June 4 evening: Enraged by the announcement of BKS, other two major organisations spearheading the agitation - Rashtriya Kissan Mazdoor Sangh and Bharatiya Kisan Union - say agitation had not been called off or deferred.

He said the government would also set up five agriculture colleges. These would train as many as 260 students in the first year in various agri disciplines, and start functioning from the next academic session (2017-18). Singh said tenders had already been floated for the four cold storages, each of 5,000 metric tonne capacity, announced last year. ""These will come up in Ranchi, Gumla, Giridih and Deoghar districts,"" he said and expressed the hope that these would become functional by the end of 2018. This year, chief minister Raghubar Das had announced the construction of 10 cold storages in his budget speech, the minister reminded the media, and said that work on these would begin soon. ""These cold storages, with 5,000 metric tonne capacity each, would be constructed in the districts of Simdega, Lohardaga, Bokaro, Chatra, East Singhbhum, West Singhbhum, Palamau, Garhwa, Godda and Sahebganj,"" he said. Singh explained that all the cold storages would be run by local cooperative societies under the supervision of Vegfed (Jharkhand State Adivasi Cooperative Vegtable Marketing Federation) and profit would be shared between them on a 50-50 basis. ""Five agriculture colleges would also start functioning from the next academic session,"" the minister announced, adding that these would be coming up at Garhwa, Godda, Deoghar, Hansdiha (Dumka) and Gumla. They will all be affiliated to Birsa Agriculture University (BAU) of Ranchi. While the colleges at Garhwa, Godda and Deoghar, each with 60 seats in the first year, would offer agriculture courses, those at Hansdiha and Gumla, with 40 seats each, would train students in dairy development and fisheries respectively, he said. Singh said that initially, it was proposed that the colleges would be run on PPP mode as the infrastructure for all was ready. ""But later the government decided to run them on its own under BAU, which would be the best option,"" he felt."

Before the embargo, Turkey had supplied around a half of the tomatoes consumed in Russia.""We have secured serious developments on all issues outside of tomatoes. We have shared our sensitivities on the tomato issue,"" Yildirim said.Admitting the tomato had now become a ""symbol"", he added: ""Regarding the tomato, we need more time.""Russia is keen to promote its own production of tomatoes as its seeks to diversify its hydrocarbon-based economy and develop agriculture.Quoted by Russian media, Medvedev said that the ban on Turkish tomato imports would stay in place, although all other restrictions on fruit and vegetable imports had been lifted.He said tomatoes were not included as Russia wanted to ""preserve investments made in the sector that should not come to nothing.""The November 24, 2015 shooting down of the Russian plane led to an unprecedented crisis in ties and prompted Russia to impose a raft of sanctions against Ankara.These included an effective ban on Russian package holidays to Turkey, ruining the 2016 tourism season in the country's south. That ban has since been lifted.After a reconciliation deal last year, relations have seen a rapid improvement with the two sides working together in a bid to end the Syria conflict.Erdogan had invited President Vladimir Putin to the Istanbul Black Sea summit, during a visit to Russia earlier this month. But the Russian strongman did not attend, with Medvedev representing Moscow."

It was turned into cultivable land by CITU-affiliated Kerala State Road Transport Employees Association (KSRTEA) of Attingal depot.Plastics and non-biodegradable waste had been dumped on this 50 cent of land. We had to work a lot to clean up the land, said S J Arunjith, a conductor and joint secretary of KSRTEA in Attingal. The fruits of their labour include ladies finger, green chilli, brinjals, banana, bitter gourd, tomatoes, cabbage, cauliflower, pea, red and green amaranthus,etc.The success of their initiative can be gauged from the fact that they could harvest 20 kg of pea per day. Their produce got snapped up at their depot itself. Most of the produce got sold within the unit itself. We sold the vegetables for Rs 5,000, said Anilkumar, a KSRTC employee. Organic manure prepared according to bio-composting method was used for cultivation.We adopted organic farming method for better ecosystem management and produce toxin free vegetables. Organic farming will enhance our agro ecosystem along with improving the fertility of the soil. It will help regulate the biological cycle, said Arunjith.The entire farming process was done by the employees during their free time, said Sanilkumar, member of KSRTEA. The water required for farming was taken from the nearby pond. The harvested organic vegetables were distributed among the employees at a low rate.

And the celebration was not just on the streets, but on platters of luxury hotels as well. Several of them came up with food festivals celebrating the spicy mouth-watering cuisine of the state thats still on.The Westin Hyderabad Mindspace, too, celebrated the spirit by organizing Telangana Food Festival at its plus restaurant Seasonal Tastes both for lunch and dinner. They have named it Telangana Food week which is on till June 12.The specially crafted cuisine is offered as a thhali consisting of several variants in sections of coolers, starters, main course and, of course, desserts.

The mirchi bhajji was quite a hit even with expats as we saw them savouring a mouthful from their plates. Kodi Koora was nice cooked as the chicken pieces seemed to have taken nicely to the hot spices and tasted perfect with the soft freshly-fried fluffy puris.The real spicy food items were served for the main course. Chef Srikanth and Yadiah had curated the menu. They shared, The state food uses a lot of locally grown vegetables and curd to minimise the effect of spices. The famous chilis of the state put our tongues on fire as we tasted Oori Koodi Koora, spicy country chicken cooked the way it is prepared in rural pockets of Telangana. The heat was balanced when we tried it with steamed rice.Adding Mamidikaya Pappu, lentil soup prepared with raw mangoes gave a feel as we were dining at somebodys home. In the vegetarian section one can try Vankaya Tamata, brinjal and tomato curry and Chikkudukaya Koora, broadbeans curry.After a heated delicious food trail we tried the dessert platter comprising Bakshalu, jaggery filled stuffed flat bread, Parvannam and Rava laddu. Bakshalu was so delectable that we had more of it. Charges: Rs 1,486 for lunch."

I offered a new dish litti-chicken prepared by my associate, Ashok, which became a rage among Delhites and even among foreign visitors, he said.Sangeeta Singh of NASVI said street food happened to be a big industry with great employment opportunities. Many foreign countries support street food to tap their tourism potential, but our country, which has maximum varieties, lacks this kind of support and promotion, she said.

I went to his home and found that he was from a poor family. I offered him a seat in our college for free and today I am overwhelmed with his results.

Picture by Amit Gupta Ranchi, Jan. 15: This Tusu, the madal beats softly. The height of chaurals, bamboo structures worshipped as symbols of prosperity, is short. Tusu, mostly celebrated in Chotanagpur and Kolhan regions by tribal and non-tribal agrarian community after paddy harvest from January 14 (Makar Sankranti) to January 25, is low in spirits this year, as farmers are short of cash. In the wake of cash crunch after demonetisation, farmers sold paddy and vegetables at abysmally low rates. Now, they don't have purchasing power to celebrate Tusu in style. Farmers sold tomatoes for Rs 2-3 per kilo and paddy for Rs 10-11 per kilo at rural haats. Budhan Singh Munda, mukhiya of Tamar in Ranchi district, which falls in south Chotanagpur region, said as much. ""There was surplus production. But, farmers had to sell their produce for peanuts as no one was ready to pay the minimum support price. Where's the money to celebrate the festival lavishly? Only bare minimum rituals are being followed,"" he said. A schoolteacher of Tamar, Ajay Kumar, said for residents it spelt some cheer as paddy and vegetables cost less in the ripple effect of demonetisation. ""But, farmers are suffering, as low-key Tusu celebrations point out,"" he said. Tusu-related businesses are also suffering. Govardhan Munda, who specialises in making chaurals, did brisk business till last year, selling around 50 bamboo structures. This year, he sold 10. ""Budgets are less,"" he rued. The price of chaurals start from Rs 500 and can go up to Rs 10,000 depending on height and decorations as they appear in various rural competitions, he said. ""But this year, buyers looked for shorter and less gaudy chaurals,"" he said. People are also cutting down on jaggery, a traditional sweetener for Tusu delicacies like pitha. Jaggery comes for Rs 35 to Rs 40 a kilo. Jaggery seller Gautam Haldar said he lost around 50 per cent business this year. ""In other years, we used to sell truckloads of jaggery during December-January. This year, our sale is almost half,"" he said. Tusu is an integral part of Chotanagpur and Kolhan districts, Ranchi, Khunti, Seraikela-Kharsawan, twin Singhbhums, among others. Festivities start with the ritual bath in rivers on Makar Sankranti."

His audience, a group of college students, listens closely.On the far side of the cafe, two women sit together picking at potato wedges and making awkward first-date small talk.Anywhere else, they would have looked incongruous, but at Chez Jerome  Q, said to be Delhis first LGBTQ cafe, no one blinks an eye. The so-called abnormal is normal here, and judgment is meant to be left at the door.Since Chez Jerome opened, its hosted speed dating events for straight and queer couples, ladies and trans mens nights, discussions about LGBTQ issues, and meetings with queer artistes.Waiters swish by, taking orders and placing empty glasses on a counter over which a large rainbow flag is draped. Behind the counter, on the door of the bathroom, the usual stick figure of a man or a woman has been replaced by a figure thats half-man, half-woman. It is labelled WE DONT CARE.The sun sets and all of a sudden theres music. The Qutub Minar glows in the night sky. The students break into dance. One of the young men is wearing a long embroidered purple skirt. A glittering rhinestone necklace peeks out from below the collar of another boys checked shirt. A huge neon green turban is perched precariously on the head of a young woman. They sway joyously, unselfconsciously to the beats of megahit Hindi pop song Kala Chashma.A man with a big tray of drinks and a bigger smile ambles towards the customers, takes their orders, and introduces himself. His name is Sambhav Dehlavi and he is owner, head chef and matre d all rolled into one. If you seem to want company, hell sit down with you, share a cigarette and tell you how he set up Chez Jerome last year to create a safe public space for the LGBTQ community.Are there not already places in Delhi where queer people can hold hands or dress the way they want? Theres difference between being tolerated and being welcomed, Dehlavi says, between feeling like an outsider and feeling at home.When you enter, you realise that youre free here, says 18-year-old Nitish Anand, who defines himself as gender-fluid and asexual. Your choices of being different are okay.Pulkit Sharma, a 19-year-old Delhi University student who identifies as queer, says the cafe serves as a safe haven and represents a giant leap for the city.Its an idea that took shape as Dehlavi backpacked across Europe a few years ago and worked as a chef to pay his way. Every city he visited boasted a vibrant queer culture with at least one public space for the community.In India, where sex between people of the same gender is outlawed and where queerness is normally shunned, Dehlavi feels the need for spaces such as Chez Jerome is even greater.He is quick to point out that exclusion is not his aim. I want this to be a safe space for women, too, Dehlavi says, for anyone who wants to be part of an inclusive culture.A version of the Spanish pincho, strips of meat and potato tied to garlic bread and topped with cherry tomatoes. (Facebook/ Chez Jerome - Q Caf)Even Dehlavis menu is a study in unconventionality. Its a free-wheeling assortment of foods from across Europe: Frances famous croque monsieur; a version of the Spanish pincho, strips of meat and potato tied to garlic bread and topped with cherry tomatoes; Greek omelettes with feta cheese, baby spinach leaves and chopped red onions; and a white Italian pizza with Dehlavis personal twist  a layer of potato chips and cream cheese.And theres more left off the menu that Dehlavi will whip up for you if you fall into conversation with him.

Express Photo by Dasarath Deka Gokul, Bipul, Kailash, Phanindra, Narayan and Bubul in Nalbari. Express Photo by Dasarath DekaTILL ABOUT a decade ago, Nalbari district, 80 km from Guwahati, was the home of leaders and hundreds of cadres of the outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA). Today, many of the young men here have rejected the gun and picked up the plough.Watch What Else Is Making NewsThe change started around six years ago when six friends got together, convinced 42 families in their village to lease them small parcels of land and decided that agriculture was the way forward.We tried looking for government jobs but realised that we had to pay bribes. Private companies dont pay much, anyway. Thats when we decided to set up Sankardev Joibik Krishi Paam in 2011, says Bipul Haloi, 42, one of those six and a former temporary teacher who lost his job.We cleared about 40 bighas of land in 2012 and began to cultivate potatoes, cabbages and pumpkin. We worked hard and at the end of the year, earned about Rs 3 lakh, says Bipul.Now, their land base has increased to 300 bighas, with help from the Mariadanga Namghar Samiti, the local prayer hall committee; they have 25 labourers working for them; and, they cultivate pumpkin, gourd, cucumber, beans, cabbage, cauliflower, brinjal, tomato, potato, banana, guavas, mangoes, lemon and litchi.In 2016, just the pumpkins that we grew on 150 bighas fetched us over Rs 17 lakh, and gourds about Rs 1.4 lakh, says Phanindra Haloi, 36.Phanindra, who has completed Class XII, quit a temporary job at a private firm in Guwahati to take up farming. Other members of the group have similar stories: Bubul Haloi, 37, worked for three years in a bookstore in Guwahati; Narayan Haloi, 40, was a mason; Gokul Haloi, 30; worked as a newspaper hawker in Nalbari town; and Kailash Haloi, 32, was employed on a casual basis at a nursing home.Last month, the government horticulture department provided them 1,000 saplings of strawberry, and a supermarket in Guwahati had promised to buy the entire produce.What is most important is that everything we grow is 100 per cent organic. The floods that occur here often have deposited a thick layer of alluvium, and the land we took up had been unused for years, making it fertile. We dont use chemical fertilisers, either. We buy cowdung from the villagers, and the agriculture department has set up a compost unit, says Narayan.We do not have any problem selling our produce, too. Wholesale agents come from Guwahati, Shillong and Aizawl to take our vegetables. In 2016, three truckloads of pumpkins, weighing about 45 tonnes, were exported to Bangladesh. We plan to set up a marketing team or promote local youth to take to marketing so that the benefits remain within our district, says Bipul, adding that they also provide additional income to at least 30 households who supply cowdung.Nalbari has a high unemployment rate, with the latest Assam Human Development Report putting it at 9.4% against the state average of 8.1. And, many of these unemployed youth are high school drop-outs. This group of six has become a kind of role model. Now, at least half-a-dozen such groups have come up along the Pagladiya river in Nalbari in the last two years. These farmers are educated, have access to information and are hard-working, says Bangshidhar Kalita, programme officer for organic farming in the Assam agriculture department.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Jadhavs dont feel tension. Mother Mandakini brushes off all talk of anxiety in the stands where the family sat, watching son Kedar, play his part in Indias epic chase of 351 against England late on Sunday. We know our boys ability. And you know how great Virat Kohli is. Bas, mag kaay tension? says the wiry lady, sitting ramrod straight with a sparkle in her eyes on an easy couch at their flat, wearing one of her favourite green saris as mediapersons troop in and out of the drawing room of the Jadhav house.The Jadhavs are part of a strictly middle-class neighbourhood off Paud Road in Pune  theres a girni (flour mill) around the corner, the clean pathway leading upto the four-storey apartment (where Jadhavs own two adjoining flats on one floor) is lined with trees and two wheelers alike. You are bound to bend down at the low roofed entrance to the building to mind your head and on a busy Monday, to admire the elaborate Rangoli someones drawn up to celebrate the Kedars 120.Two of his three sisters had headed to the Jadhav home in Vanaz  10 minutes off the Express Highway on which the international stadium had risen on the horizon few years ago  for Sankranti. Black saris and finery in tow, with the traditional til-gul (a soft sesame-jaggery sweet) exchange planned as a family reunion, the sisters met Kedar the day before the match, as the youngest son dropped by for the annual ritual. We never talk about cricket a day before his matches, and hes also very relaxed.Nothing fazes him, says sister Sucheta. Our father always had leadership qualities and has a confident personality. Every single person in the family is capable of handling biggest problems and weve always faced challenges headlong. All these qualities have trickled down into Kedar, she says.The excitement was palpable at the Jadhav household in Pune. The excitement was palpable at the Jadhav household in Pune.Father MS Jadhav retired from MSEB in 2003  a year before Kedar debuted in Ranji Trophy, and the family was happy that the four children had between them a English Literature PhD, an engineer, a Finance MBA and finally a sportsman.I used to wonder initially how come a good boy like Kedar drifted towards cricket, the father quips, before hes drowned out by protestations of the sisters and the mother. He never liked studies much, and he was always good at cricket. The good thing was though he would disappear for hours on end to play, he would always tell us where he was going. No sneaking away, no secrets, says eldest sister Charusheela.A 80m long rectangular pebble strewn playground  with a neat joggers walkway around it in the adjoining Lokmanya Nagar was where Kedar started his cricket. Its called the Jeet ground, though the original three-storey Jeet building facing the ground after which the tiny maidan took its name was razed down for redevelopment. Thats where the tennis ball cricket started. He would announce hed hit a big six and the ball would sail into the Jeet building terrace next ball, Sucheta recalls.ALSO READ | Kedar Jadhav: Tennis ball legend who hit an aceAll his katta friends ended up with strong arms and weary shoulders as he would make them bowl to him for hours. And he picked up his first nickname in the neighbourhood. They called him mini Sehwag, and he liked the name so he would tell people he is Mini Sehwag. There was never a shortage on confidence.The years spent waiting in the wings  he is 31 now  werent full of angst or frustration. Ive never seen him sad about not being selected for India when he was younger. He had great patience, even during those Ranji seasons when he wasnt consistent. He is so sure of himself that we werent surprised that he would make good the chances he got, says sister Sucheta. While hed vroom away on his Yamaha  the kit-bag getting drenched every monsoon on his long trips to Cadence Academy, the family decided to buy him his first car for purely utility reasons.A close knit family, Kedhar Jadhav never grew up as a spendthrift  though he was the baby of the family and much adored  and would hand his earnings to the family, and like in his childhood, borrow a minimal Rs 1,000 from his dad when he stepped out. Jadhavs known for his love for clothes, sunglasses and belts. He is also famous for his Salman Khan fandom since his teen days. It wasnt just how he celebrated his maiden ton in Zimbabwe  with the Dabangg hook step  its also his insistence on watching Khans films first day-first show in movie-mad Pune.Like father, like daughterThe star of the family though is one-and-half- year old daughter Miraya, whos inherited an uncanny love for dancing from father Kedar. She can watch Salman on TV and start dancing to the exact steps, though shes barely started talking. She dances to Jag Ghumeya though shed just learning the words, says aunt Sucheta.Wife Snehal and mother Mandakini  whos a little frail and was unsure of whether she could be at the stadium for 7-hour stretch  were not scheduled to travel, but the mother decided on a whim and then both baby and grandmum were packed up in woollens into the car to watch their first international.He loves stuffed brinjal and a tomato chutney, but I couldnt make it this time he came, his mother says, recalling how hed gorged on it after making a 327 in Ranji Trophy after beating Mumbai last season.

593bc9387be9e04956d788b6,Worth going ‘Fidahh’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/worth-going-fidahh/article18587550.ece,2017-05-27,,The Hindu,"As Iran elected its president, I was reminded of a band of young Iranian friends I had way back in time. In those days when Jawaharlal Nehru University was where all rebels gathered  though I cant say it has changed much since then, despite all efforts to tame it  they studied in JNU and were greatly critical of the Shah of Iran. As Hassan Rouhani was re-elected, I thought of them, wondered where they were, and decided that we would have an Iranian meal in their memory.So I trotted off to the Food Court in the Nehru Place Metro Terminal, in search of an eatery called Fidahh, where I heard you get good Iranian food. I went there and found that the food is essentially Lebanese (of course, theres a shared culinary heritage in the region), but there are quite a few Iranian dishes, too. There is, for instance, something called jujeh kabab, spiced chicken kababs served with rice and a dip.This is a food court, so you order your dishes and eat at a table at the centre of the court, which has a large sitting area. I asked for some lamb chelo kabab (Rs. 340), which I have often eaten in a restaurant called Peter Cat in Kolkata, a chicken shawarma roll (Rs. 219) and, hoping to be healthy, a fattoush salad (Rs. 185). The chelo kabab was to have come with a bed of rice, a red chilli dip and warm pita bread. There was no pita bread  warm or otherwise  but the kabab was excellent, as was the long grained rice, mildly sweet and spiced.I enjoyed the salad, a mix of lettuce leaves, tomatoes, cucumbers and onions, flavoured with zaatar, a mix of spices often used in the region which lends a tart taste to a dish, mint, olive oil, lemon juice and sumac (a much used herb). This was to have been served with crispy pita bread, but I dont think it was my day for bread, for there was no pita with my salad.Deliciously crunchyWhat I really enjoyed was the chicken shawarma, a roll of chicken and iceberg lettuce, served with hummus. The chicken was excellent, lightly spiced but well flavoured, and the roll itself was deliciously crunchy. I bit into it, and the juices oozed out, giving the dish just the right bit of moistness that it needed.Fidahh sells dips, toothere is the garlicky chickpea hummus, the yoghurt dip tzatziki and the grilled eggplant dip, babaghanoush100 grams for Rs. 160. You can try out the hummus bil lamb, the dip prepared with chickpeas, garlic, tahini and olive oil, served with marinated lamb chunks and pita bread. If you get the pita, that is.The region loves its meat, but they have a great many vegetable dishes too. So Fidahh has quite a comprehensive vegetarian section. Paneer, alas, figures prominently there, thanks to a demand for it, no doubt. The Fidahh special vegetable roll (Rs. 220)  a meal in itselfconsists of red, green and yellow peppers with paneer wrapped in a pita bread. There is spinach and cheese kabab (Rs. 265) and tabulleh wrap (Rs. 199) with tomato, onion, parsley, mint, lentils and pomegranate seeds). There is even something called falafel chaat for Rs. 200.There is a harissa (hot chilli pepper paste) chicken steak with summer grilled vegetables for those who want something substantial. And there are stews for those who like their gravies  lamb, chicken and fish stew that costs between Rs. 300 and Rs. 320.The food is delivered to the neighbourhood. The official address is TDI South Bridge, Shop No 6, Food Court, Lower Ground Floor, Nehru Place Metro Terminal, and the phone numbers are 9911166951 and 9971166951.I liked the look of the place, and the food. Its light, but not bland. And its flavourful but not drowned with spices. I felt sated after my semi-Iranian meal. I thought of friends long gone from my life, and wished them peace, wherever they are."
593bec567be9e04956d79822,A bumper farm crisis,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-bumper-farm-crisis/article18470885.ece,2017-05-17,,The Hindu,"Farmers in some States are regretting their abundant yields this year as the prices of agricultural commodities have crashed. Chilli farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, tomato growers in Karnataka, and toor dal cultivators in Maharashtra are at the centre of a severe crisis that has witnessed prices fall by more than half in a matter of just weeks. Some speculate that high commodity prices last year caused farmers to respond by boosting production, which in turn led to the present price crash.Whether it is the wholesale mandi s where farmers sell their agricultural produce, or retail outlets where consumers buy them, price fluctuations are common. But whether such fluctuations can be explained as being due to mindless crop cultivation, as some speculate, is not as certain. For one, in the consumer market, commodity speculators usually dampen price fluctuations by managing supply according to consumer demand. For instance, when the supply of grains is abundant, speculators do not flood the market with all their stock but instead hoard the grains and sell them later when supply turns scarce. Thus, even if farmers engage in mindless grain production, speculators usually save the day for consumers by preventing steep rises and falls in grain prices.Price fluctuationsSecond, in the wholesale market, speculators can save farmers from similar price fluctuations by paying a competitive price for their produce even when there is abundant supply. Grain traders, to return to our previous example, who want to hoard supply expecting higher grain prices in the future would be willing to pay a better price to farmers today. This comes not out of compassion for farmers, but purely out of competition with other grain traders. When farmers are free to sell their produce to any trader they want, it is traders paying the best price who get hold of it. Farmers can also expect a more predictable price for their produce each season, reflecting stable consumer prices, thus preventing mindless cultivation.Such competition though is precisely what is missing from the Indian agricultural scene where the supply chain is broken. Red tape, including limits on stocking agricultural products, has prevented the growth of a robust market for commodity speculation. The result is lack of investment in infrastructure like that of cold storage; about 40% of agricultural produce in India is wasted because of it. This, in turn, has led to price fluctuations that have affected both the farmer and the consumer. Wholesale agricultural prices are determined by trader cartels that block competitive bidding. This significantly reduces the price farmers can get for their products, while boosting the profits of some privileged traders. By some estimates, farmers receive only 20-25% of what the final consumer pays for his product. Thus, a free market in agriculture can be the best antidote to the crisis facing Indian farmers."

However, Microsoft said they had pioneered digital agriculture applications that included a sowing application for farmers in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh that advices them on the best time to sow based on weather, soil, and other indicators. Mr. Kammardi said the commission had already developed an interactive digital dashboard, which collects real-time data on prices of agriculture commodities from the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees across the State.We alert the government if the prices are falling below the cost of production or the minimum support price so that intervention can be made whenever necessary, he said. The same data has also been used to conduct a price forecast analysis of three to six months based on an advanced econometric model in consultation with Lalith Achoth, who heads the Department of Diary Economics and Business Management at the Dairy Science College in Bengaluru.An attempt had been made to forecast prices of a total of 25 agricultural and horticultural commodities in the Perspective and Forecasting report submitting to the State government by the commission in December 2016. We had predicted a collapse in prices of tomatoes in the State in the report, he said.The price projection, he said, was based on one variable  price of a commodity prevailing over the last couple of years. The commission is planning to join hands with technological companies like Microsoft to develop software for forecasting of prices of commodities based on multiple variables, including weather, soil, supply, area under cultivation of the commodity, among others, he said. Prediction will be more precise if multiple variables are considered, he added.Mr. Kammardi said there was a need for the farmers to be aware of the supply position of the crops they are growing and the price forecast region-wise.The commission was working towards a State level comprehensive production policy for agricultural and horticultural crops keeping in mind food security needs, local demand, supply of raw materials to industry, and export to foreign countries.Alongside, a suitable crop plan needs to be formulated at the district level in association with farming community keeping in mind the climate, market, and State production policy."

Chandrababu Naidus plan to popularise and promote traditional and authentic Andhra cuisine internationally has sent a team of the Tourism wing on a delicious trail of identifying and moderating to add nutritional value to the most authentic traditional dishes, some of which are on the verge of extinction.A team led by Andhra Pradesh Tourism Authority (APTA) Joint Director Sudha Kumar, a culinary expert, is currently engaged in identifying and perfecting healthy recipes.There are some not-very-popular traditional recipes with the health factor intact in them. Ingredients such as pounded rice, organic vegetables and fresh local raw components add that extra flavour to Andhra cuisine, says Mr. Kumar and cites the example of a unique idli -making practice in Ambajipet of Konaseema region. It is called Pottikkal. Fermented idli batter is wrapped in jackfruit leaves in the shape of a cone and steam-cooked. The aroma of jackfruit leaves enhances the flavour of the idli , lending the dish a unique touch, explains Mr. Kumar, informing that the pyramid idli served with ulavacharu (the concentrated extract of horse gram) is very healthy.Method of cookingLeaves and flowers of drumstick, jackfruit and amla which have medicinal value, are also being brought into use. Method of cooking and use of traditional utensils like brass vessels and earthen pots, not seen much these days, is yet another focus area.The recipes thus culled out will be referred to a team of nutritionists for their expert advice and endorsement besides roping in an ayurvedic doctor to present his point of view on the identification of medicinal value of each recipe.After consulting with some of the top chefs in Hyderabad, Mr. Kumar and his team have identified about 30 recipes in different categories.AppetisersIn the appetisers section are delicacies such as Nalleru kada vada (vada made with the stem of Nalleru, a medicinal plant) and kobbari kudumulu (coconunt dumplings): under main course, mulaga puvvu thalimpu (tempered drumstick flower) and arati puvvu-pesara kura (banana flower-green gram curry); cereals- menthe kura-tomato annam (fenugreek leaves-tomato rice) and dampudu biyyam pesara molakala pulao (pulao with hand-pounded rice and green gram sprouts); pulses- Chintha chiguru pappu (dal with tender tamarind leaves) and in the non-vegetarian category dosakai mamsam (meat with yellow cucumber) and sora puttu (a fish delicacy).The team members are on an elaborate exercise of standardising each of these recipes for taste, texture, yield and nutritional balance. The cooked samples will be sent to the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibrating Laboratories (NABL) to evaluate the amount of carbohydrates, proteins and based on their feedback, the recipes will be further modified if need be.The final details of the recipes will take the form of a book that will be printed and published for public use. The Tourism Authority also plans to host food festivals across the country and cookery contests in the State.We can embrace healthy food with simple tips. Substitute use of sugar with brown sugar, palm jaggery or fruit syrups. For example, Kakinada khaja can be made using sugar syrup made with pineapple juice, banana juice or strawberry juice, he says. Eliminate deep frying which absorbs more oil and take to concealed way of cooking (dum style of cooking). Use more of ingredients like yellow pumpkin, raw banana flowers and stem, drumstick leaves, methi leaves and cow ghee."

The campus was decked up as though for a festival, but this one was with a purpose.The Garden City Farmers inaugurated their exhibition-cum-workshop Oota From Your Thota at St Josephs Girls High School in Fraser Town to raise awareness on the importance of organic terrace gardening among students and gardening enthusiasts. The event promoted gardening on terraces and balconies for urban dwellers who crib about not having space to grow plants in their homes.The programme revolved around the idea Grow what you eat and eat what you grow. Vegetables such as tomato, green chilli, cabbage, bitter gourd, drumstick and greens can be grown on rooftops. Even fruits such as grapes and sapota can be grown with the pruning method which helps the plant bear fruits even when it is not growing vertically.Dr B N Vishwanath, president, Garden City Farmers, said, I will not stress on the word organic because it is has lost its meaning. People have started calling anything and everything organic. I would rather say that we need to try to grow plants naturally in the best possible manner.As many as 68 different stalls were put up to showcase different types of enterprises related to organic terrace gardening.Accessories such as high densitypolythene bags which can be used as makeshift flowerpots instead of heavy concrete flower pots, seeds of flowers and vegetables, pots made of coir and sprinklers with timers were also available.N Ramakrishnan (65), a resident of Basaveshwaranagar, who has been growing plants on his rooftop for five years, said, The quality of the vegetables and greens that you grow by yourself is very different from what you get in the market. You can feel a difference in the taste. Ramakrishnan has grown vegetables such as tomato, brinjal, French beans and all kinds of greens.Anitha, a resident of Shivajinagar, was intrigued by the idea of using vegetables which could be grown in the garden. She said, I never knew we could grow vegetables like drumstick and cabbage on terraces. I am surely going to try it in my house. The workshop which was conducted has been helpful to know the proper procedures.The programme was inaugurated by BBMP corporator Abdul Rakeeb Zakir who announced that he would request the Horticulture department to allot a space of 20,000 sq ft near Coles Park in Fraser Town to Garden City Farmers to encourage their initiative."

Farmers are demanding loan waivers and remunerative prices for all crops, many of them encouraged by Uttar Pradeshs decision to write off loans given to small farmers. The governments of Maharashtra and Punjab, where the protests are spreading, have rightly resisted because loan waivers only offer relief that is usually exhausted in two farming seasons.The cardinal malaise lies in successive governments treating agriculture as a source of votes and not an engine of growth. That kept the rural-urban wage gap wide at 45%, almost four times that of China, and shrunk the share of farming in GDP to under 14%, although more than half of Indias 1.25 billion people still depend on it.To be sure, India is reforming parts of its economy. But not farming. If farmers are to escape poverty, farming needs to become more like manufacturing: Teched up operations, free as far as possible from imponderables, churning out quality produce that fetch the right price.For this, things need to change. The old, labour-intensive methods must give way to technology for efficiency and higher yield; Pricing and subsidy mechanism must be overhauled; and, most importantly, India must look at fewer people farming.For far too long, farming has been at the mercy of nature, especially the June-September monsoon rain. The use of technology is patchy, and only one-tenth of every rupee the government spends on rural areas goes to improving productivity  which is why farmers in India grow 46% less rice an acre than their Chinese counterparts.Our farm subsidy policy encourages the production of only low-value staples, such as rice and wheat, and the output of fruits and vegetables  that more Indians are eating and farmers producing  is not covered by the governments minimum support price. Much of the farm distress sweeping India now stemmed from a glut of potatoes, onion and tomatoes.Worse, the monopoly of traders over local agricultural markets is perpetuated by law, which bars farmers from selling directly to consumers. This kills any chance of farmers getting a fair price, lining the pockets of commission agents instead.In the past, a single season of dry spell was enough to send the economy into recession. Now failed monsoons trigger localised distress. Thats an improvement. Still, far too many farm households remain too poor. And unless the rural economy is unshackled from a time and policy warp, our dream of double-digit economic growth will remain just that: A dream."

These are the three factors agitating Indians who depend on farming  90 million families, or 54.6% of Indias 1.2 billion people.As anger sweeps rural Madhya Pradesh after the death of six farmers in police firing, farm protests roil rural Maharashtra -- wholesale markets are shut, produce is being dumped on streets -- and governments of the debt-ridden states struggle to respond to demands for loan waivers, an IndiaSpend analysis and reportage from rural Maharashtra explores why farmers are both angry and desperate.The primary reason farming is unviable in India is that farms are now among the worlds smallest (the global average land-holding size is 5.5 hectares)  too many people are dependent on shrinking farms.Since 1951, the per capita availability of land has declined by 70%, from 0.5 hectares to 0.15 hectares in 2011, and is likely to decline further, according to ministry of agriculture data.Such small and marginal land-holdings, as they are called, now constitute 85% of the number of operational farms in the country, according this 2015-16 report on the state of Indian agriculture.It is hard to use modern machinery on small farms, the owners of which are often too poor to afford farm equipment. Manual labour increases costs, but labour too has been in short supply, as workers migrate to cities. Further, their size and output limits access to loans and institutional credit.Those are the larger issues. Here are the three reasons for the current turmoil, gleaned by IndiaSpends analysts and reporters:1. After back-to-back droughts, a good harvest, but incomes fallAs 2017 rolled in, the news from Indias farms appeared good.After droughts in 2014 and 2015, a good monsoon in 2016 reversed two years of rural economic decline. Indias agricultural growth contracted 0.2% in 2014-15 and grew no more than 1.2% in 2015-16, because of the back-to-back droughts. In 2016-17, the agricultural economy grew 4.1%.Across many states growing pulses, such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Gujarat, markets were flooded with produce, especially tur (pigeon pea), which witnessed the highest growth among all pulses, an important source of protein for a majority of Indians. India is the worlds largest pulses producer.However, an influx of pulses from Myanmar, Tanzania, Mozambique and Malawigrowing 20% over two financial quarters, from September 2016 to March 2017, the Business Standard reported on March 3, 2017caused the price of Indian tur to plunge.From Rs 11,000 per quintal (from December 2015), the price of tur fell 63% to Rs 3,800-4,000 per quintal  20% below the minimum support price (MSP)the price at which government buys farm produceof Rs 5,050 per quintal (including a bonus of Rs 425) since December 2016 as Indiaspend reported on April 12, 2017.The table above explains how production of pulses rose 29%, from 17.15 million tonnes in 2014-15 to 22.14 million tonnes in 2016-17. Tur production increased 50%, from 2.81 million tonnes to 4.23 million tonnes, over the same period.The MSP for tur should be increased to Rs 6,000 per quintal in 2017 and Rs 7,000 per quintal in 2018, a government committee headed by chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian recommended in September 2016.As on March 2017, the minimum support price for tur was Rs 5,050 per quintal, nearly 20% (18%) lower than the prices recommended by the committee on pulses.As these prices crashed, farmers found it harder to find money to store their produce and prepare for the next season because demonetisationthe withdrawal of 86% of Indias currency, by value, on November 2016 left them starved of cash.2. How demonetisation  and government red tape  left farmers short of cashOn May 18, at around noon, 30-year-old Prashant Lande waited under a harsh summer sun to sell 800 quintals of tur at the Amravati agricultural produce market committee (APMC), 664 km east of Indias financial capital, Mumbai.From Kinhala village in Amravati districts Ashti taluka, in Maharashtras eastern region of Vidharbha, Lande said he refuses to sell his 800 quintals of tur to the government procurement centre, although the state buys tur at a higher rate.At the market, Lande could sell his tur at Rs 3,800 to Rs 4,000 per quintal, while the government buying centre offered Rs 5,050 per quintal.We dont sell to the government centre because the process of selling takes one month  from standing in line for the token to the sale to finally when the payment reaches the account, said Lande. Our fellow farmers who have sold their produce at the procurement centre on March 22, are yet to receive their payments and it is nearly June!It does not help that the effects of demonetisation continue to to be felt across the rural economy.Right after demonetisation, tomato farmers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, and onion farmers in Maharashtra and Gujarat, were the worst hit as prices fell by 60-85%, IndiaSpend reported on January 18, 2017.With little respite more than six months later, the experiment has aggravated the circumstances leading to the current farmers strike.By now we should have begun preparing our fields for the monsoons, but because of demonetisation and the unavailability of cash, we are still struggling to find money for sowing, said Lande.At such a time, farmers like Lande turn to credit.Up to 57% of farm families in Maharashtra are indebted; the figure for India is 52%, according to the National Sample Survey Organisations 2013 situation assessment survey of farm households, the latest available data.This indebtedness has widespread consequences. More farmers committed suicide in Maharashtra (4,291) in 2015 than any other state, rising 7% from 4,004 in 2014, followed by Karnataka (1,569) and Telangana (1,400), as IndiaSpend previously reported in January 2017.Now, after Uttar Pradeshs new government waived Rs 30,792 crore of farm loans, pressure is building on the governments of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to do the same. Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has been reluctant to do so, but with his governments coalition partner, the Shiv Sena, and other parties preparing for a political agitation, he may find it hard to exercise fiscal prudence.3. In an era of climate change, 52% of Indian farmers without irrigationThe basic problem across most of rural India is that despite the spread of irrigationa sector plagued by unfinished projects and corruption52% of Indias farms still depend on the vagaries of rain, which is becoming increasingly uncertain in an era of climate change.Extreme rainfall events in central India, the core of the monsoon system, are increasing and moderate rainfall is decreasing  as a part of complex changes in local and world weather  according to a clutch of Indian and global studies, as IndiaSpend reported on April 15, 2015.The droughts of 2014 and 2015 in rural Maharashtra were mitigated by the plentiful rains of 2016, but many parts of the state also endured floods. Uncertain weather affects the ability of government extension systems to provide accurate advice to farmers.The government encouraged us to grow more tur in the kharif (July to October) season, since these crops consume less water and are in high demand, said Lande, the Vidarbha farmer. We would not have faced so much loss over the last three years, had there been a proper system of canals.Despite six decades of irrigation, less than 50% (or 66 million hectares of Indias net-cultivated area of 140 million hectares) as irrigated, according to the 2015-16 State of Agriculture report. Groundwater provides water for two-thirds of Indias irrigated land, but those levels are falling from overuse.From the first five year plan (1951-56) to the eleventh (2006 to 2011), the central government has spent a total of Rs 3.51 lakh crore, as we said, on major irrigation and flood control projects characterised by time and cost overruns, shows this 12th Five Year Plan (2012-2017) report.On July 1, 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY)or the Prime Ministers Farmers Irrigation Programmewith a budget of Rs. 50,000 crores over five years (2015-16 to 2019). The motto of the PMKSY is Har Khet Ko Pani (water to every field) and More crop per drop.In 2015-16, less than a third (Rs 312 crore) of Rs 1,000 crores set aside for micro-irrigation was released, reveals this government report. Of this, upto April 2016, no more than Rs 48.3 crore, or less than 5%, was actually spent, according this micro-irrigation financial progress monitoring report. The government set Rs 1,763 as the 2016-17 micro-irrigation target, but no data on results have been released.The micro-irrigation programme covers an area of 6,51,220 hectares, or 0.46% of net cultivated area.(Salve is an analyst with IndiaSpend.

But as soon as the sun sets, and the food is served, everyone is smiling and chatty. Eyes suddenly light up with gratitude and glee. You can hear some banter on one table and a child screaming with joy on the other.However, even if you arent fasting, rest assured that the lip-smacking food found in the hidden pockets of this area, abuzz with restaurants dishing out their signature preparations, will make your mouth water. Heres a glimpse of what to expect on your Iftar trail.Shami Kebab and Chicken HakimiNoor Mohammadi, Bhendi BazaarBhendi Bazaar is a busy nightspot through the year. Its especially busy during Ramzan. And the largest crowd is usually gathered at Noor Mohammadi, waiting to break their fast with falooda, fruits and some lip-smacking Shami Kebab (Rs 20). Made with minced chicken, chana dal and spices, the kebab is hand-pound to a texture so soft that it is hard to lift them without having them fall apart. Another specialty here is the Chicken Hakimi (Rs 500), essentially tandoori chicken soaked in a thin liquid concoction of buttermilk, chaat masala and butter.Bheja, Kaleji or Gurda MasalaBa-Barkat, Nagdevi StreetHere, your choice of meat, bheja (lamb brain), kaleji (lamb heart) or gurda (lamb kidney; Rs 180), is pound with some oil, tomatoes, onions, chillies and lemon juice to form a dish that has the consistency of egg bhurjee.Bhel Bara HandiSurti, Bohri MohallaLocated a stones throw away from Tawakkal Tandoori Chicken, Surti is famous for its Bara Handi, and sees huge crowds during Ramzan. The dish acquires its name from the 12 vessels that traditionally have different types of pulse-based gravies, each containing a different cut of mutton or tenderloin. The one served at Surti, however, is a banquet of seven gravies. While each of the gravies can be had by itself, a dish called the Bhel (Rs 150), which combines all the different gravies, is also served here. The ensuing gravy is a union of mutton, dal and garam masalas.Aab GoshtCafe Nizari, Bhendi BazarDunk some pillowy and slightly sour pav (Rs 7) into a bowlful of rich fiery mutton stew (Rs 70) primarily prepared with gram lentil, tomatoes and onions.Baida RotiMastan Talao, Nagdevi StreetA meal in itself, the Baida Roti (Rs 100) found at Nagdevi Street, is an Iftar must-have. A thick layer of minced keema or chicken is sandwiched between two hot and fluffy flour-based rotis that are coated with egg.Chicken TandooriTawakkal Tandoori Chicken, Nagdevi StreetThe Chicken Tandoori (Rs 110) served at the buzzy stall located on Nagpada Street is another local legend. Juicy and tender pieces are coated with a marination of your choice. The three varieties of tandoori are chicken malai (marinated in creamy yoghurt, ginger, garlic and chilli), hariyali (coated with a paste of coriander, mint leaves, ginger, garlic and lemon juice) and the regular chicken tikka masala.Reshmi Special MalpuaBadri Mithai, Nagdevi StreetWatching Reshmi Special Malpua (Rs160) being made is almost hypnotic. Batches of dough, prepared with maida, sugar, saffron, milk, cardamom, semolina, etc., are dipped in a vessel of hot oil and fried till the outsides of the dough turn golden brown and crisp. The resultant is a steaming hot pancake that leaves you with a saccharine aftertaste the entire night.

Many a restaurant has been lost to the siren call of this beautiful bungalow at the start of Worli Koliwada.Its a beautiful space. A long corridor leads to a bar, the third of four parallel, pale-olive-green rooms, each with a distinct character. The bar is buzzy, the attached lounge sedate and intimate. The outer eating area has the relaxed air of a drawing room; the inner ones dominant long table is reminiscent of a dining room.Slink and Bardot describes itself as a French-themed restaurant serving modern-day Parisian cuisine. The menu embraces international dishes, ingredients and flavours as enthusiastically as classic and contemporary French cuisine. Its not too different from modern Indian, an equally rootless cuisine that draws on, and sometimes combines, local and global tastes.The eating areas at Worlis Slink & Bardot are intimate, relaxed and a nice contrast to the buzzing bar section. (Aalok Soni / HT Photo)At Slink and Bardot the cheese plate contains British, Spanish and Swiss cheeses, and a French one produced in India. The charcuterie platter is made up entirely of Italian meats. Along with a Salade Parisienne, is an American Caesar, Spanish gazpacho and Nordic gravlax - all made with Indian ingredients.They only serve small plates. Our cocktail arrives first; the gin-based Sitting in an English Garden Waiting for the Sun, served in a long-stemmed martini glass, is the equivalent of a slinky dress, but the cucumber juice drowns out the other flavours.A standout dish at Slink & Bardot is the tomato and mozzarella tart. Sweet, skinned tomatoes and gooey mozzarella come stacked on a thin, crushed-Parmesan, biscuit-like base. (Aalok Soni / HT Photos)The food seesaws between mundane and extraordinary. The panko-crusted popcorn chicken, essentially glorified McNuggets, are too salty, and the three dipping sauces are an indistinguishable blur of textures.

Government health officials participated in the meeting.Outlawing momos, however, would accomplish little.The substance at the root of Aroras claims, monosodium glutamate (MSG), also known as the brand name Ajinomoto, is frequently used in the preparation of dishes with East Asian flavouring such as noodles, fried rice, chilly paneer, and chilly chicken.The flavour enhancer is also naturally found in vegetables such as potato, tomato, and mushroom, as well as several fruits and wheat and dairy products. It is added into a variety of grocery items.MSG came to the limelight in 2015 when samples of Nestles Maggi were found to include the flavour enhancer despite Nestles claims to the contrary. Maggi was also shown to have higher than permissible quantities of lead.India does not stipulate a maximum limit of MSG in food. The Food and Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) requires that it should be used in accordance with a general set of good manufacturing practices and only in certain types of food.To help people make an informed choice about what they eat, the FSSAI also says that food items that do contain MSG must announce its presence on their packaging.What is MSG? Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) is a flavour enhancerIt is commonly found in Chinese food, soy sauce, parmesan cheese, potato chips, and frozen foodsIt also occurs naturally in items such as potatoes, tomatoes, milk, mushrooms, and wheatThough consumption in large quantities may cause headaches, numbness, chest pain and sweating, and eventually lead to elevated blood pressure, it is still basically safeCan it really cause cancer?It is popularly believed that MSG causes sluggishness, headaches, nausea, increased thirst, skin rashes or excessive sweating. Scientific studies around the world, however, have failed to establish any negative health impact associated with MSG, let alone cancer. The Food and Drug Administration, the premier regulatory body of its kind in the United States, categorises MSG as generally recognized as safe.If consumed in higher quantities or regularly, it is also known to have caused palpitations and chest pain in some people, said Ritika Samaddar, chief dietician at Max Super Speciality Hospital. It is an approved flavour enhancer; even the US allows its use. We just suggest that as a precaution, pregnant women and infants not consume it.It definitely does not cause cancer, she adds."

This recently launched eatery is the equivalent of your friendly neighbourhood caf, and food here is just simple, but full of flavour.With a bar on the roof overlooking Ulsoor Lake, this also makes for the perfect setting to grab a few drinks with your friends on a rainy evening in Bengaluru.Just like any other caf, the pizzas, burgers, sandwiches and pastas are your best bet here. We especially loved the Goan Sausage Pizza, which comes with a thin, crunchy base and is loaded with meat. The Pork Belly Panini and the Grilled Tenderloin Burger are sure to get your hands messy, but are packed and will fill you up in no time.If burgers and pizzas are not your speed, try the Spaghetti with Prawns, Sundried Tomatoes and Fennel - it comes with a light parmesan broth, and the prawns are large, juicy and cooked just right. For the die-hard meat lovers, the Tenderloin Medallions with Mashed Potatoes is an excellent option - big on both size and taste. Handed to you with a rich pepper sauce, this dish goes perfectly with their Baby Spinach and Watermelon Salad or the Quinoa Salad which are light and refreshing.For desserts, do make sure to check out the counter to see what theyre offering that day. Their Lemon Meringue Pie and Eton Musk Sundae are great ways to end your meal.For those with an inkling towards all things chocolate, the Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Pie and Cookie Dough Skillet are good options. We particularly enjoyed the Coconut Tres Leches, a light, fluffy dessert that isnt too high on sugar content.While the cocktails are mainly your run-of-the-mill sangrias and mojitos, there were two on the menu that really stood out for us. The Smooth Talker, with whiskey and cinnamon as the main ingredients, tastes like a comforting, alcoholic apple pie that your mom bakes for you when youre feeling low. The Mr Felix is another cocktail worth trying if youre in the mood for something fresh and citrus-y, as its bursting with lemongrass and kaffir lime leaf flavours.However, with crowd-pullers like Tao Terraces and Yauatcha on the same floor, its hard to tell if Caf Felix will be able to match their popularity in the months to come."

My travels have been no different!Sojourns across South-east Asia have left an indelible impression, influencing both, my style of cooking and menu planning. Interestingly, South-east Asian cuisine comes with a whole lot of unsuals. Consider the concept of serving in bowls, whereby the bowl serves as a complete meal in itself!By virtue of expediency and exquisiteness, the Vietnamese Pho, Burmese Khowsuey and Singaporean Laksa, all bowl meals, have reached tables of leading restaurants across the globe.Another lasting gastronomic influence in my life came from my five year stint in the beautiful Maldivian islands, where I picked up the art of contrasting flavours, textures and temperatures. I had the pleasure of tasting a local specialty - a yellow fish curry served with rice and crisp drumstick leaves. The taste and texture of the meal linger on, and have, in fact, become the basis for a whole lot of innovations.One such dish on our menu, which, in the true sense is a culmination of these learnings, is the Hu-Tieu-Sai-Gon!Hu tieu (spiced noodle soup) is a traditional Vietnamese dish specific to southern Vietnam. This bowl meal is a perfect balance of spiciness from chilies, sweetness from jaggery, sourness from tamarind and the crunch from fried peanuts! To prepare Hu-Tieu- Sai-Gon, make a stock of fresh veggies along with spices such as garlic, star anise, ginger, cinnamon and chopped lemongrass and bring to a boil. Strain the broth and put back on the boil. Add a homogenous mix of coconut milk, peanut butter, mushroom oyster sauce, light soy to the broth.For the toppings, use blanched vegetables and cooked rice vermicelli in boiling water for not more than a minute. To assemble, add boiled rice vermicelli in a soup bowl. Top it up with the blanched vegetables, crispy onion and garlic slices. Pour the boiling broth over this and serve alongside shredded lettuce, sliced tomatoes, sprouts, basil leaves, chilli and lime wedges.Like all my journeys, thus far, I wish to continue the exploration of the myriad nooks in this world that lead me to less travelled culinary havens and ultimately to the discovery of life itself.

Being a homebound person by nature, I spent a lot of time in the kitchen helping my mother. Our food needs a lot of whisking, and she would ask me to stir the curries. She taught me how to make kibbeh, a mixture of finely ground lamb or beef, bulgur, onion, mint and Middle Eastern spices, which we would stuff in fish or lamb and fry, says Alshamali. The 35-year-old chef in the midst of launching a modern Middle Eastern cuisine eatery at the Renaissance Downtown Hotel, Dubai is in Mumbai to helm the ongoing Arabesque food festival at the J.W. Marriott Juhu.When we meet Alshamali, the Lotus Caf is pleasantly enveloped with the pleasing fragrance of zaatar and cinnamon. Middle Eastern food is similar to Indian food as most of the ingredients are similar, shares the chef. The food that Alshamali is dishing up for Arabesque is more home-style making it an authentic Arabic experience on a platter.On the menu is an authentic shawarma station. Alshamali is serving shawarmas with a special red chilli paste he has brought all the way from Syria. From the grill section, we try chicken in harissa sauce, prawns in a green souk sauce made from coriander and chillies. While the ingredients are easily identifiable, they create a completely unique zing on our palates. We quite enjoy the mild chicken cooked in yogurt with saffron.Past the grill section, which also has crunchy baby corns, green chillies and baby aubergines,we take a dollop of kabsa, rice with minced meat and meatball in tomato sauce made with pomegranate molasses, kokum and sumac, which gives the dish a berry-like sourness.The chef, whose earlier stint has been at Qbara, a modern Middle Eastern restaurant that made it to Worlds 50 Best Restaurants this year. He says, My first job in Dubai was in Atmosphere, the highest restaurant in the world housed in Burj Khalifa, where we served authentic French cuisine.He breaks down Arabic cuisine to the basics. Tahina is made from roasted sesame and harissa, a sauce made from Magrebi red chili, Moroccan spices and garlic, are the most commonly used. We also make a fine green zouk sauce which has coriander, green chillies, caraway seeds and lemon juice. We use pomegranate molasses and cumin too in our curries, he adds, sharing a childhood memory of his mother pickling vegetables for winter months. She would put the olives in brine solution for two months before we could eat it, he smiles.Our order of the shawarma is here, and we roll the pita bread that is stuffed with grilled chicken, the Syrian red chilli paste, lemon juice, onions. We dunk it in sour cream and the sweet and tangy red chilli paste pleasantly surprises us. While it is not at all spicy, it is supremely flavourful.Alshamalis version of a bakalava takes us into a food trance. Its freshly made and comes with a twist.

But what has come as a reprieve was that the prices of essential veggies such as onion and tomato, had stayed below Rs 30 per kg.Summers usually see rise in vegetable prices due to water shortage and decreased arrivals of produce. Traders say that almost all supplies to Chennai are coming from other States and hence the transport cost adds to the vegetable prices. They say the prices have been on the rise for last one week.In the wholesale market at Koyambedu, onion, which was sold at Rs 12 per kg, is now sold at Rs 17. Tomato and potato, which were sold at 15 per kg, are now sold at Rs 25 and beans sold at Rs 60.Sales are dull. When the cost is high, people tend to buy less; they buy something like half kg instead of 1 or 2 kg. But, only when we increase the prices we get decent profit, says Badriswamy, vegetable vendor, Koyambedu.Traders say most of the vegetables and fruits are transported from neighbouring States such as Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. In such cases, the cost of production and transportation falls on the vendors and traders and as a result, price rise happens and burdens the buyers.This is the case every year. Vegetables and fruits are very essential. Demand will always exist, but sometimes it is not met with sufficient supply. Hence the price rise to which Ive clearly reconciled myself, says Rathna.In Aminjikarai market, prices are at peak. Brinjal is sold at Rs 80 per kg and tomato at Rs 30. A sack of onion, earlier sold at Rs 400, is now sold at Rs 800 and 1 kg onion is sold at 20 kg. Carrots and beans are sold at Rs 70 and Rs 80 per kg, respectively.I buy minimum of all vegetables as the prices are high. My budget for vegetables for a week is Rs 100, says Allabakash."

593c79bf7be9e00e964d2780,The ultimate price: Should what you pay for tomatoes matter?,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/the-ultimate-price-should-what-you-pay-for-tomatoes-matter-4611009/,2017-04-12,,Indian Express,"Photo for representational purposes. Photo for representational purposes.This is the time of the year when as temperatures rise with the summers onset, so do prices of most vegetables. Its a phenomenon as predictable as the fall in prices that accompany lower temperatures during the winter months.A good example is tomatoes, which are currently retailing at around Rs 16 per kg, as against an average range of Rs 8.5-12 during November-January. In all likelihood, prices will firm up further over the next couple of months. Last year, they averaged almost Rs 45 in May, over Rs 56 in June and eased somewhat to Rs 30 in July, before collapsing to below Rs 10 per kg in August (see chart).These wild price oscillations have largely to do with natural, occasionally untoward, factors determining availability. Tomatoes are usually a 120-125 day crop, which start yielding fruits after 75 days, with production happening in flushes. There can be up to ten flushes in any given crop cycle, each following the previous one in four-five days intervals. Although tomatoes can be grown year-round, the water stress during summers means plantings mostly happen in June-July (with the monsoon rains), October-November and January-February. Arrivals pick up from mid-August onwards and peak over the winter.The above irregular supplies are further exacerbated by tomatoes being perishable and not amenable to storage, unlike potatoes or onions. The result is that prices fluctuate hugely during any year, with consumers having to especially pay much more in May-June-July, when crop availability is very poor.When prices of any vegetable go up, there is a natural outcry from consumers. But whats often not realised is that an average household consumes a basket of fruits and vegetables (F&V). While prices of individual items may go up, what matters ultimately for the household is how much it pays for the entire basket during any given month.Thus, even though tomato prices go up with dwindling supplies in the summer months, this does not hold true for other vegetables such as bhindi (okra), kheera (cucumber), lauki (bottle gourd), tinda (round gourd), tori (sponge gourd) and chichinda (snake gourd). You get all these cheaper in summers because of increased availability, which is also the case with mangoes (the King of Fruits), watermelons, sweet lime (mosambi), lychees, plums, peaches and cherries.In the same chart displaying the swing in retail tomato prices since January 2016, we also have the average per kg rate for the entire monthly F&V basket consumed by households. This price  based on the average value of F&V purchased by our consumers at Bigbasket.com  turns out to be relatively uniform and stable. Our consumers paid between Rs 43 and Rs 60 per kg for the average F&V item, which is quite different from shelling out anywhere from Rs 8.5 to Rs 56 for a kg of tomatoes.If overall price stability is what counts, we shouldnt worry much if individual items within the entire F&V basket cost more during certain months. Moreover, prices become an issue only when they go up. Spare a thought for the poor farmer, including the one growing tomatoes. Last August, prices crashed to levels where production costs could not be recovered. In November and December also, a bumper crop, coupled with the sudden demand shrinkage due to demonetisation, led to farmers destroying their standing crop in the field. But that did not bother us much.Price stability is eventually not just about consumers. Its also about farmers. Without a mechanism to ensure enough remuneration for the farmer to feed and take care of his familys essential needs, he will be in no position to produce to meet our consumption requirements. The farmer should be entitled to a reasonable annual income increment, just as we look forward to during this time of the time. A four-five per cent yearly increase in our average F&V spend shouldnt be too much for us to bear.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Bhupendra Rana Hardik Patel at Karamsad on Thursday. Bhupendra RanaPatidar quota agitation leader Hardik Patel, who was at Karamsad, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patels birthplace, in Anand district, on Thursday, vowed to fight against injustice across the country in order to realise Sardars unfulfilled dreams of a united India. This was the first visit of the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) leader to the Charotar region of central Gujarat. Hardik, who also faced protest banners here, symbolically picked up a fistful of soil from the home of Sardar Patel.WATCH WHAT ELSE IS IN THE NEWSFlanked by PAAS supporters, Hardik arrived at Karamsad on Thursday evening, three hours behind schedule and headed straight to the house of Sardar Patel. Amid chants of Jai Sardar, Jai Patidar, he picked up a fistful of soil from the premises and declared his well-rehearsed vow. He said, I will fight for the Patidar community in Gujarat and for all other communities of the country. In any part of the country, where the dream of Sardar Patel has remained unfulfilled, either of farmers or any other communities, I shall fight for their right as this is a very important matter for me. I swear by the soil of this holy place.After spending about 15 minutes inside Sardar Patels house and looking through a collection of his belongings and photographs, Hardik told mediapersons about the protests against him. The BJP youth wing, armed with rotten tomatoes, eggs and black flags, greeted Hardik as he entered Karamsad. Several banners with a photograph of Sardar Patel, purportedly put up by the residents of Karamsad read in English, Hardik Go Back.Hardik said, It is the right of people to oppose. We are opposing the government and the BJP is opposing us. But no one from Sardar Patels family has opposed the movement. Today, as a shoe was hurled at the state Home Minister, it is natural that BJP workers will be agitated. But Im very happy to be here today.Local PAAS leader Ravi Patel said that in the days to come, the group plans to carry forward the agitation to the rural areas of the district.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Here, vegetables grow all-round-the-year, thanks to Ambothi,60, a revolutionary farmer, who uses waste water from houses in the village to keep his land green and fertile.Ambothi says it was his son, A Selvan, who came up with the idea to use waste water from homes, which is always available, to irrigate their one-acre land, after rearing of crops became difficult due to the failure of monsoons. ""I decided to try growing crops with the water that is discharged from homes, water that is used for washing, bathing etc, but not toilet discharge,'' says the farmer.Five years ago, he convinced the villagers to allow him to transfer the grey water from their homes to his land, for which he laid a pipeline for a distance of about one kilometre. Ambothi spent about Rs 1lakh to lay the pipeline and construct two 20 x 20 foot tanks, which are 15 foot in depth, to store the water. The farmer uses water from about 450 houses in the village.The water is collected in the two tanks, which fill up to the five foot mark every day. It is then then pumped with the help of an electric motor. ""The water that flows out is clear as the sediments settle down,"" he says.""I have been cultivating various crops, including tomato, brinjal, chilli, ladies' finger and various types of gourds according on the season as water is not a problem for me. I have been been reaping better produce than earlier,''says Ambothi, while adding that he uses fertilizers like potash only during the early stages of cultivation and that the use of chemicals is minimal.Palanisamy, a villager, says that he had at first ridiculed the idea, but is now awestruck to see the results. ""The vegetables grown here also appear to be more colourful and big,'' says Palanisamy. Meanwhile, the people are also happy as the waste water is drained away from their homes daily, and they don't have to bear the stench or suffer the menace of mosquito breeding."

(Express File Photo: Mayur Bargaje)After a 10-day gap, auctions in 305 Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs) across Maharashtra finally resumed as farmers, who had been staging an agitation, decided to bring their produce to the markets. The core committee of agitating farmers, which met in Nashik on Thursday, had conditionally decided to resume agriculture supplies to the APMCs.The immediate impact was a sharp reduction in vegetable prices in the markets. At the Nashik APMC, a 20 kg crate of tomato that fetched Rs 200-250 10 days ago, before the strike started, was now selling at Rs 100-150. We are now afraid that the massive glut in the market, will lead to a massive fall in prices hitting farmers further, Neelesh Kor, a trader from Nashik APMC said.Many farmers had been expecting that due to the massive shortage over the past few days they would end up getting decent prices in the market. However, many of them returned disappointed. Before the strike, a bunch of 10 cauliflower heads would sell for Rs 100 to Rs 150 but on Friday, the price was between Rs 40 and Rs 50.We are scared of how long these prices will fall. We suffered over the past few days because we could not bring the produce to the market. Now we are suffering as the prices have fallen, Vishnu Sonawane, a farmer from Dindori, said. We have started the auction. Farmers suffered quite a bit during the strike as they would not bring the produce to the market. Over the past 10 days, traders were going to farms and picking up the produce. We hope that normalcy will get restored in the next few days, Jagdish Apsunde, a trader at the Nashik APMC, said.The core committee of farmers, while deciding to resume agriculture supplies to APMCs, had, however, laid down an ultimatum stating that if the state does not hold a meeting with the committee in the next two days they will hold sit downs before all government offices on June 12 and stage a rail and rasta roko across the state on June 13. The Committee has also stated that from Friday, it will not allow any minister in state government to hold any kind of function in the state.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

(Representational Image) The Pune Market Yard has seen vastly improved supplies, which have brought down the prices significantly. (Representational Image)Prices of vegetables in both wholesale and retail markets in urban areas such as Pune and Mumbai have seen large scale correction, bringing much-needed relief to consumers. Prices of almost all other fresh vegetables, barring garlic, have come down by almost 30-40 per cent, as the markets reported increased arrival.Earlier, the week-long farmers strike had crippled the supply of vegetables across major wholesale markets in the state. Farmers had refused to trade their produce at the markets and had also taken to the streets to stop the supply of such commodities to urban centres. The price of fresh commodities, including vegetables and milk, had gone up by a whopping 40-50 per cent between June 1-8 across the state. While the supply had improved towards the last few days of the strike, most of the supply of fresh produce was from outside the state.The Pune Market Yard has seen vastly improved supplies, which have brought down the prices significantly. As against the traded price of Rs 4,000 per quintal of June 2, tomatoes traded at Rs 600 per quintal on June 9. Similarly, for okra, prices have dropped from Rs 6,000 per quintal to Rs 3,000 per quintal. Onion prices have also seen a slight dip, from Rs 1000 to Rs 850 per quintal. Supplies have improved in Vashis wholesale market, with more than 600 trucks of vegetables arriving in the market on Saturday.Suresh Pingle, president of the Vegetables Traders Union of the market, said prices of almost all vegetables ranged between Rs 10-20 per kg. The drop in prices at the wholesale markets have resulted in a similar trend in retail markets. Vishnu Salve, president of the Pimpri retail market, said prices of most commodities had dipped by 50 per cent. However, garlic prices remained high, as supplies were hampered due to the ongoing crisis in Madhya Pradesh.

To start with, they seem to be concentrated in the relatively more prosperous agriculture belts  the stretch from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune to Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur in Western Maharashtra and Neemuch, Mandsaur and Ratlam in MPs Malwa region. Farmers here grow a range of commercial crops. They are also largely from progressive agricultural communities such as Marathas and Patidars. These farmers  unlike their brethren in drought-prone Marathwada, Vidarbha or Bundelkhand, who are largely into subsistence agriculture, and often resort to seasonal migratory employment  have seen good times, particularly through the first decade of this century till about 2013. This was a period of remunerative prices for most crops on the back of a global agri-commodity boom and domestic demand fuelled by rising incomes.The first setback to the above party came towards mid-2014, with the collapse of world commodity prices, leading to both falling exports and rising imports of farm products from the country. The current crisis, however, has to do more with domestic headwinds that may have some link with demonetisation. In virtually every crop marketed since November  whether soyabean, green gram, pigeon-pea and potatoes or tomato, onion, garlic, red chili, fenugreek, grapes and pomegranates  farmers have experienced huge price declines. The government claims this is mainly due to bumper production. But there is also a demand side. Produce trading in India is predominantly cash-based. The body blow this traditional agro-commercial capital has suffered due to demonetisation  and the inability of formal finance to fill the gap  may explain the apparent lack of liquidity in the markets now. With nobody really to buy and stock up, the speculative capital that used to buoy commodity prices has practically ceased to exist. And its farmers who have taken the ultimate hit.This situation is unsustainable, both politically and economically. But the solution cannot lie in farm loan waivers. Indebtedness is only the symptom of the actual disease, which is one of low prices and demand for produce. What the farm sector desperately needs is liquidity, which can come from institutional finance, modern agro-processing and organised retail, both domestic and foreign. While a zero GST rate on most primary farm produce is a welcome move, it needs to be supplemented with the removal of all restrictions on stockholding, domestic movement and exports. There is also a case to impose higher import duties, especially on pulses and edible oils, as a temporary measure. If there can be anti-dumping duties and minimum import prices on steel or float glass, why not for products from the farm  more so, in todays troubled times?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

A sales ban has exacerbated losses, as the military fears profits are funding insurgent activities.In recent weeks, the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) donated 30 tonnes of early-maturing, pestresistant seeds to Borno's farmers.But IITA coordinator Kamai Nkike said three consecutive rainy seasons have been missed and the current season, which began two weeks ago, is also likely to pass without crops being planted.""Farming in northern Borno at the moment is practically impossible,"" said Nkike. ""The farmers want to be on their own.They are not happy with food aid."""

The delicate skin has fewer oil glands compared to other areas and is constantly exposed to the suns harsh rays and other chemical concoctions like harsh soaps and detergents. Plus, our hyaluronic acid decreases with age, leading to pigmentation, prominent veins and thin skin. This process starts in your mid-20s but becomes evident in the early 40s.Care for your hands as you do your faceExposure to water, cleansers, hand sanitisers, dry weather, long hours in air conditioned environments affect your hands. But with a little care, you can remedy the situation. Firstly, moisturise as much as possible. Whether you are sitting in your car or in your office, always keep lotion handy. As for the men, while strong hands might be appealing, callused ones certainly arent. So use a hand cream too but just dont borrow one from your partner. Sonia Sharma, Spa Manager at Taj Salon, Vivanta by Taj - President, Mumbai, advises purchasing formulas meant for men as their skin tends to be thicker. While doing the dishes, use gloves to avoid contact with harsh detergents. Swap harsh soaps for gentle hand washes with pH levels between 5.5 to 5.7.Dr. Neena Chopra, director, Beauty and Technical, Just Herbs (an e-store for organic and ayurvedic luxury skincare) has simple advice. She urges you to use the same anti-ageing products meant for your face, on the backs of your hands. Massage it in to improve circulation and then slip on thin gloves before bed. Also, a hand mask once a week delivers an intensive dose of hydration to your skin. Dr. Renita Rajan, a consultant cosmetic dermatologist, offers a quick home-care facial for the hands. Lather up a gentle cleanser and add some brown sugar to the mix. Use the concoction to gently scrub the skin until the sugar dissolves. It will exfoliate your skin without being unduly harsh.Of course, never forget sunscreen, even for your hands. Dr. Neeraj Tulara, specialist internal medicine at Dr. L H Hiranandani Hospital, Powai says, Just like the rest of your skin, your hands are vulnerable to damage from the sun, including dark spots that can make them look older. To protect them, Tulara says to regularly apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher reapply often. And if theyve gotten sunburnt, a paste of fresh tomato juice will reverse the damage.Pay attention to your potionsDr. Jamuna Pai, celebrity cosmetologist at Blush Clinic, Mumbai, advises being smart about your hand products. Whilst selecting your moisturiser, check the labels for key ingredients such as hyaluronic acid, niacinamide and dimethicone, besides urea, glycerine and shea butter as these will replenish the moisture that the environment takes out from your skin by pulling the water from the inner layers of your skin to the surface. Aloe vera, vitamin E oil, mango butters, also work well to soften and heal your hands. Dr.Chiranjiv Chhabra, director and consultant dermatologist at Skin Alive, recommends using a product with retinol at night since it has great anti-ageing benefits and stimulates collagen production.If you want to go beyond homecare, Dr. Apratim Goel, cosmetic dermatologist and laser surgeon, Cutis Skin Studio, Mumbai, suggests trying out the new Helios-II fractional laser, which works wonders on shrivelled hands and removes age spots and tanning. Filler injections containing hyaluronic acid like Juvederm, Restylane and Meso Infusion can also be given to moisturise the skin from within, she says.Give your hands, a handThe age-old offenders like smoking and drinking will sap your skin of any moisture. Load up on good ol H20 because dehydration can affect your hands badly. A good well-balanced diet rich in vegetables, zinc and fatty acids will contribute to soft skin. Dr. Maithili Kamat consultant dermatologist at Jaslok Hospital & Research Centre, tells her patients to keep a stress ball handy as squeezing it not only helps release tension but also helps build the muscles of your wrists and hands."

REUTERS/Ari JalalIraqi government forces killed the Islamic State commander of Mosuls Old City on Tuesday as the battle for the militants last stronghold in Iraq focused on a bridge crossing the Tigris river. As fighting intensified on Tuesday after the previous days heavy rains, civilians streamed out of western neighbourhoods recaptured by the government, cold and hungry but relieved to be free of the militants grip. IS snipers were slowing the advance of Interior Ministry Rapid Response units on the Iron Bridge linking western and eastern Mosul but the elite forces were still inching forward, officers said. Government forces also pushed into areas of western Mosul, Islamic States last redoubt in the city that has been the de facto capital of their self-declared caliphate.Watch what else is making news:Federal police killed the military commander of the Old City, Abu Abdul Rahman al-Ansary, during operations to clear Bab al-Tob district, a federal police officer said. With many IS leaders having already retreated from Mosul, Ansarys death comes as blow to the militants as they defend their shrinking area of control street-by-street and house-by-house. Capturing the Iron Bridge would mean Iraqi forces hold three of the five bridges in Mosul that span the Tigris, all of which have been damaged by the militants and US-led air strikes. The southernmost two have already been retaken. We are still moving toward the Iron Bridge. We are taking out snipers hiding in the surrounding building, we are still pushing for the Iron Bridge, Brigadier General Mahdi Abbas Abdullah of the Rapid Response force told Reuters.Near the Mosul Museum, Iraq forces used armoured vehicles and tanks to attack snipers pinning down troops clearing areas around the bridge. An air strike targeting one Islamic State position hit a building, engulfing nearby troops in smoke and dust. Since starting the offensive in October, Iraqi forces with US-led coalition support have retaken eastern Mosul and about 30 percent of the west from the militants, who are outnumbered but fiercely defending their last stronghold in Iraq. For much of Tuesday, the troops were within 100m (330 feet) of the bridge. Its very key for our forces to secure the riverside and prevent Daesh militants from turning around our advancing forces, a Rapid Response spokesman said in the morning, using an Arab acronym for Islamic State.They expected to gain control of the Iron Bridge and the nearby area by the end of the day, he said. Seizing the bridge will help further tighten the noose around Daesh fighters entrenched inside the old city, he said.HEAVY SHELLINGThe boom of shelling and heavy machinegun fire could be heard from the centre of Mosul and helicopter gunships strafed the ground from above on Tuesday morning. Amid the combat, a steady stream of refugees trudged out of the western districts, carrying suitcases, bottles of water and other possessions. Some pushed children and sick elderly relatives in handcarts and wheelbarrows. Soldiers packed them into trucks on the Mosul-Baghdad highway to be taken to processing areas. Most left in the dark early morning hours or after the army recaptured their neighbourhoods. Food had been scarce, they said. We fled at 5 a.m. (0200 GMT) after the army had arrived. There has been a lot of shelling by Daesh, said Hamid Hadi, a teacher. Mostly weve been eating water mixed with tomatoes.Ashraf Ali, a nurse who escaped with his wife and two children, said mortar rounds were falling as they fled. They took advantage of the army retaking their district to get out. Daesh wanted us to move to their areas but we escaped when the army arrived, he said. As many as 600,000 civilians are caught with the militants inside Mosul, which Iraqi forces have effectively sealed off from the remaining territory that Islamic State controls in Iraq and Syria. The Iraqi forces include army, special forces, Kurdish peshmerga and Shiite militias.More than 200,000 Mosul residents have been displaced since the start of the campaign in October. The Ministry of Immigration and Displacement said on Tuesday that in recent days, almost 13,000 displaced people from western Mosul had been received seeking assistance and temporary accomodation each day. Whenever we advance there are more people coming out, said one Iraqi officer directing refugee transport. There are more people on this side of the city and people are trying to leave because there is no food and no supplies in their area.Losing Mosul would be a major strike against Islamic State. It is by far the largest city the militants have held since their leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed himself leader of a caliphate spanning Iraq and Syria from a mosque in Mosul in the summer of 2014.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

While the situation in the Maoist-hit district is slowly improving, its district headquarters mirroring a well-kept small town and Maoist influence being largely pushed into the jungles of Bijapur, Sukma and Narayanpur, senior police officers still identify Katekalyan as a problem area.Yet, Katekalyan has quietly been building another identity  as the nursery of organic farming mushrooming across the district, where farmers have come together to set up a company to market their produce across the country.Gonelu Ram is one such farmer. It isnt paddy season yet, so the crop is assorted  tomatoes, peas, chana and mustard. Standing in front of his lush green fields, he beams as he reels off their names, and then adds an important note. All this is completely organic. The fertlisers I use are what nature gives Cow urine, neem leaves, bitter gourd leaves and besharam patta. My produce has never been better before 90 per cent of Katekalyan has now returned to completely organic farming, he says.Watch What Else is Making NewsTill about five years ago, Ram, like most other farmers across Dantewada district, was caught in a dilemma. Organic fertilisers and indigenous seeds were part of the knowledge passed down to farmers for generations, but the administration, looking at agriculture as a way of reaching out to people in a conflict zone, was sending a different message. The crops that were pushed were homogenous high-yielding varieties that worked best with chemical fertilisers.These high-yielding seeds and the fertilisers were not suited for the microclimate. There was good yield for a while, but the soil soon became unresponsive and it killed the ecosystem around it. There were no fish in the ponds or earthworms in the ground. Now, the district administration is returning to organic methods, and wants to make Dantewada a completely organic farming district, says Akash Badave, who was a PMRDF fellow in Dantewada and has since been working on agricultural improvement in the district.The Indira Gandhi National Agricultural University records 22,000 different varieties of rice found in the state, most unique to it. And Dantewada is no different. Badave says that while no exhaustive study has been done so far, a 10-village sample survey revealed 35 different varieties of rice, with differences in gestation of crop ranging from 60 days to six months.The most important thing is that these communities have known these varieties for a generation, and each has different properties. There are many types of rice that have medicinal qualities, some that are given to lactating mothers, others for joint pain. Then there are millets such as Kosa, which are in high demand elsewhere but are unique to Bastar, he says.The return to traditional farming, with a few tweaks, began during the kharif crop of 2013. The district administration began the process of teaching farmers systems of rice intensification, which included tips like ensuring space between two stalks.The method was used to show that despite no use of fertilisers or high-yielding seeds, productivity could still be high. In 2013, 300 farmers adopted it, and their produce increased three to four times. Now, there are over 2,000 farmers, and 170 small groups of farmers have been formed to go around the district and tell others about the benefits of organic indigenous farming. Its a peer review system, with these groups looking at fields and certifying whether the produce is organic or not, says a senior government official.Those involved in the process realised that the system wouldnt work if there was no market to sell to. So, on August 26, 2016, the Bhumgadhi Organic Farmers Company Limited was set up to package and sell the unique Bastar produce across the country. It has since expanded to include 370 farmers. Each farmer pays Rs 1,000 to buy a share in the company, which in turn buys organic produce and uses state-aided technology to improve the seeds. In the next month or so, district officials plan to procure a processing unit with storage godowns.The administration is incurring some expenditure, but there will be no interest, and the money only has to be paid back in 10 years, by which time the company will have grown. The term Bhumgadhi, fittingly, means the post-harvest festival of prosperity, says Badave, who is the CEO of the company.Dantewada District Collector Saurabh Kumar says they are in touch with buyers from across the country. We are in talks to sell our produce in stores all over the country, such as Udaipur, Chandigarh, and especially in South India where the demand for our produce is very high. We are attempting to fill the vacuum of an available market, he says.A few kilometres short of Katekalyan, on the road from the district headquarters of Dantewada, some residents of Gatam village sit and listen intently to a small team that talks about the producers company. Eighty-six of them belong to an extended family, and they laugh when they are asked to confirm that number. All of us are related, one way or another, and live in one part of Madkampara village, says one of them.But the large family isnt the only thing that is striking. Amid a large swathe of brown, their fields are glistening green. Three big containers are filled with organic fertilisers, made from the waste after the droppings from the mahua tree are converted into local alcohol.Asked if they will be a part of the farmers company, one of them answers: Kucch accha ho raha hai Karenge, hum karenge (Something good is happening we will take part).For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Source: Debabrata Mohanty House of Siba Bhatra, the farmer who committed suicide. Source: Debabrata MohantyON MARCH 3, a physically challenged tribal farmer, Siba Bhatra of Sanamasigaon village in Odishas Nabarangpur, had lunch at home just after noon and walked towards his paddy field about half a kilometre away. Sibas wife Sanadi was away attending the marriage function of her nephew in another village, while his father Banamali was at home.Around 3 pm, two neighbours saw Siba lying unconscious near a cashew tree next to his field with a 100-ml bottle of Lethal Super pesticide lying beside him. After undergoing treatment for four days, Siba, 47, a father of two sons and two daughters, died in the Nabarangpur district headquarter hospital on March 7.With Sibas wife and residents of the village claiming that he was stressed over his inability to provide for his family, the death has once again highlighted concerns over farmers suicides in one of Indias poorest districts.Watch What Else Is making NewsThe death comes more than a year after five farmers committed suicide within a span of 30 days between October and November 2015 in this southern Odisha district. And, it follows two more deaths of farmers in Odisha this month, including one in Chief Minister Naveen Patnaiks Ganjam district.On Saturday, T Bulu Reddy of Chikarada village in the Golanthara block of Ganjam consumed poison after untimely rains destroyed his tomato and chilli crops, said officials. Reddy, who had taken a loan of Rs 1 lakh for farming and Rs 1.5 lakh for the treatment of his ill son, consumed poison on the night of March 10, they said.Days earlier, another farmer Khainu Bagarti, 55, consumed poison in Kendapalli of Bargarh district in the west, after his crop of chilli, cauliflower and other vegetables failed due to lack of water, said his family. The government has directed the district collector to conduct a field investigation.Nabarangpur is the focus of an ongoing assignment by The Indian Express, titled District Zero, in a zone ranked at the bottom rung of the development ladder based on several indicators, such as literacy and healthcare.Nabarangpur tehsildar Akshay Khemundu acknowledged that Siba had taken loans worth over Rs 48,000 for his farming needs over the last four years, but cited an inquiry report prepared by local officials to argue that this may not have been the reason for the suspected suicide. And officials said that compared with 2015, when Nabarangpur suffered a drought, 2016 was a good year for farmers.He had taken a loan of Rs 35,000 in 2013 from the Sanamasigaon branch of Utkal Grameen Bank, of which he paid one instalment. Similarly, he took a loan of Rs 13,150 from LAMPCS (Large Scale Adivasi Multi-purpose Cooperative Societies) in 2014, but had not paid any instalment. He was never issued any notice either by the bank or the cooperative society, said Khemundu.There are also murmurs in Sanamasigaon about domestic discord in Sibas home, which Sanadi denied. He rarely spoke and never fought with me But he used to drink a lot, said Sanadi.Nilambar Satpathy, managing director, LAMPCS, Nabarangpur, said Siba had taken a loan of Rs 13,150 in July 2014 for farming, including Rs 4,650 for fertiliser, at an annual interest rate of two per cent. The same was to be repaid in one single instalment at the end of one year, failing which the interest rate would mount to 12 per cent. Bhatra had not paid any money till the end of July 2015, said Satpathy.The branch manager of the Utkal Grameen Bank did not respond to The Indian Expresss request for comment.Sanadi said she did not know the details of her husbands financial condition, except that he got Rs 3,600 as disability allowance every year. But it was difficult for the family to earn even Rs 100 a day, she said.Though struck with polio, which had affected both his legs since childhood, Siba used to till his share of land with the help of neighbours.Sanadi has an Antyodaya card through which the family gets 35 kg of rice at Re 1 a kg every month. But it was barely enough for the family. My husband and I used to work as agricultural labourers or household workers in others homes or fields, she said.Sanadi said poverty forced their two sons Gopal, 15, and Dhanurjay, 8, to drop out of school while one daughter Urmila works as a help in a schoolteachers home in Berhampur town. Kaushalya, the second daughter, is the only one in the Bhatra household still in school and now studies in Class VII.Officials said the government has given Rs 15,000 as ex-gratia assistance to the family from the Chief Ministers Relief Fund and District Red Cross fund. They also insisted that the death could not be attributed to crop failure, as there was no standing crop in his field.But Sibas death continues to haunt Sanamasigaon. No one saw him buy the pesticide. There is no pesticide shop in our village. He must have bought it from Nabarangpur town, said his neighbour Banamali Bhatra. As his wife was away, I served him lunch. He had his food quietly and left, said Sibas sister-in-law Kusuma Bhatra.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

I had cultivated tomato on a two-acre plot and invested Rs. 2 lakh. Now, at the time of harvest, the rates have crashed, said Nagarajappa, a farmer in Mallasandra, Kolar taluk. I am going to suffer a loss of a minimum of Rs. 1.5 lakh, he said.Currently, tomatoes are being cultivated on an estimated 9,850 acres of land across Kolar district.Most farmers are struggling to get the produce into the market, and they feel it is not worth the effort. We are not even able to cover the cost of labour and transportation, K.M. Nagaraj of Srinivasapur taluk said.Varying pricesThe lack of standardisation in prices is also cause for concern.For instance, a 15 kg box fetched only Rs. 25 at Srinivasapur APMC yard on Saturday, which is less than Rs. 2 per kg. However, at Kolar APMC, the rates were marginally better: a 15 kg box was going for anywhere between Rs. 50 and Rs. 60 (about Rs. 4 per kg) on Saturday.Only a month ago, tomatoes fetched on an average Rs. 150 to Rs. 200 for a 15 kg box, which is around Rs. 13 per kg. Farmers were relatively happy with this price.A farmer can reap profit only if they get at least Rs. 300 per 15 kg box. The government should come forward to provide relief to the farmers, said P.R. Suryanarayan, president, Karnataka Prantha Raitha Sangha district unit, Kolar.Price variations are forcing farmers to leave tomatoes to rot in the field. Dumping of tomato on the roadside has become a common scene in the district.However, while there is a glut in the market as more farmers have taken up tomato cultivation, the slump in demand in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu is being seen as the main reason for the crash in price. Farmers in these two States have cultivated tomato on a large scale resulting in lesser demand for Kolar tomatoes, claimed farmers."

(Express Photo by Abhinav Saha) Red Fort in New Delhi. (Express Photo by Abhinav Saha)A new study of global pollution shows that Indias air is the worst in the world (www.stateofglobalair. org/data). Masked Delhiites, caught in a relentless shroud of smog, have no choice but to inhale copious amounts of particulate matter. Somewhere, a quiet realisation has sunk in that the way we live is not safe. This awareness has led to a shift, with the thinking urban citizen attempting to make substantial changes to his own environment.Since 2015, we have planned over 250 balconies, terraces and small garden patches in the NCR, says Kapil Mandavewala, 36, proprietor of Edible Routes, a specialised garden solution company. They offer quite a range  from vegetables to oxygen-generating plants, and creepers. Based on a large patch of land in Ghitorni, originally an artists collective where Vivan Sundaram has his studio and Bharti Kher is a co-owner, a walk through the garden is full of revelations on design and natural ecosystems: cabbages and broccoli grow together in chaos while tomatoes are surrounded by fragrant basil.This is called companion gardening. The basil repels insects naturally and increases the tomato yield, explains Mandavewala. While his clients in highrises prefer to grow herbs, he has encouraged some of them to try growing patches of cabbage, onion and garlic as well. There are interesting looking flower pots that one is unlikely to spot elsewhere, with white pipes embedded in the mud. Mandavewala explains that the biggest quandary of the apartment dweller, who works and travels, is not being around enough to water the plants.Once you top these pipes with water, the pot can go for a month without watering as the moisture releases into the soil slowly, he says. Edible Routes has pots with a nutritive mix of mud and manure made with a machine bought from a design student in Ahmedabad.After returning with a science degree from the US in 2008, Mandavewala began tilling his familys 22-acre farm in Gujarat and supplying vegetables to a few families in Jamnagar. A chance invitation from an NGO, Manzil, for a workshop on urban gardening led him to set up shop in Delhi in 2014. He took a 14-day course on permaculture, a system of agricultural and social design principles implemented by learning from nature. Applying it to an urban context came with its own challenges: the way light falls in a highrise, in a vertical slant, may not be conducive to all vegetables and oxygen-generating plants.A special focus needs to be given to seepage and drainage of water. It took me a while to understand urban spaces and explain to the clients as well that every space is capable of cultivating something, says Mandavewala. For one home, he introduced Malabar spinach called poe saag as a vine, a popular variation of spinach down south but rarely grown in Delhi. In another, a family grew tori along their border walls.The clients, meanwhile, are mostly enchanted by their gardens. The joy of growing and cultivating your own food, knowing what youre consuming, is something else, says Mandavewala, adding that many of them begin with being terrified at the idea of taking care of several plants. One of the ironies of urban India is that farm land is acquired by people who dont know how to farm; the ones who know want a job in the city, in an office.A consultation with Edible Routes can cost anywhere between Rs 5,000 and Rs 1 lakh, depending on the material cost, area and charges for executing the project. They also hold gardening workshops every month for people who want to experiment themselves.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The rates of many vegetables have skyrocketed over the last few weeks in town.According to traders, the prices of many vegetables steadily increased during April.While the prices of onion and tomato continue to be low comparatively, the cost of brinjal, beans and carrot have shot up. The rates have peaked as there is no yield resulting in poor supply to markets in Vellore, A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam.The cost of the local variety of brinjal, thorny ones, has been rising in the last one month, he said. It was priced Rs. 15 a kg earlier. The rates steadily increased during April and are now priced Rs. 80 a kg. The regular variety of brinjal costs Rs. 30 to Rs. 40 a kg.As for beans the price went up from Rs. 15-Rs. 20 two months ago to Rs. 80 now.

An abundance of the produce has led to a crash in prices, dashing the hopes of farmers.While farmers in Kolar, Karnataka, dumped tomatoes on the road after the prices collapsed to a new low of Rs. 2 per kg last week from Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 a month ago, violent protests broke out in parts of Telangana after a good yield of the commodity in the two Telugu-speaking States brought down the prices from a high of Rs. 10,000 per quintal last year to a measly Rs. 2,500 this year.In Maharashtra, the demand for tur, which rode a wave of high prices last year, plummeted after its production went up from 4.44 lakh tonnes in 2015-16 to 20.35 lakh tonnes in 2016-17. So was the case of grapes after a crash in their prices plunged the vineyard owners across the State into despair.While most farmers complain about the poor remuneration for their produce in comparison to the prices that prevailed in the previous season, agricultural economists have traced the reasons for the glut and the resultant price crash to the cobweb phenomenon.After the prices of a particular agricultural commodity shoot through the roof during a season of scarcity, farmers resort to boosting the production on the premise of the pre-existing demand and prices, leading to a problem of plenty, reasoned Dr. R.S. Deshpande, former Director of the Institute of Social and Economic Change (ISEC), Bengaluru, explaining the cobweb phenomenon.Most of the agricultural products that have now suffered a price crash due to their abundance had yielded a rich dividend in the previous season.Chilli woesA long duration crop, consuming up to eight months for harvesting, red chilli cultivation was expanded in both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh this year after the commodity commanded a good price last year.However, in the absence of minimum support price for the crop, categorised as commercial, the market dynamics of demand-supply kept the price low from the beginning of arrivals in the market this season from April first week. As the top quality red chilli yielded a price of even Rs. 13,000 per quintal last year, the farming community had hopes of good returns this year too, a senior Telangana Agriculture Department official told The Hindu . But, it was not to be. The Centre has, however, announced a market intervention plan to procure 33,700 tonnes out of the 7 lakh tonnes produced in Telangana with a support price of Rs. 5,000 per quintal and assistance of another Rs. 1,250 per quintal for other expenses.The crash in the prices of grapes not only soured the expectations of the vineyard owners in Maharashtra, but also claimed the lives of at least two farmers.Few takers for grapesThe suicide of 36-year-old Manik Randive and 25-year-old Chetan Vasal, both from Nashik, has been attributed to the poor price their grapes fetched.Despite a robust grape production, there were few takers as the prices had collapsed. According to Shriram Gadhave, president, Vegetable Growers Association of India, wine manufacturers are contending their stocks are full. The average input cost per acre of grape was Rs. 3 lakh. Yet farmers were selling their produce at barely Rs. 2 lakh, he said.According to him, in April last year, more than 95% of the grape harvest was plucked by wholesalers and wine-makers from farmers gardens.Farmers even received a decent rate of Rs. 40-42 per kg. This year, barely 75% of the picking had been completed while the average rate was a paltry Rs. 8 a kg.Dent in tur pricesTur dal, which hit the headlines last year with its skyrocketing prices, has suffered a dent in its demand this year after large scale production. In Maharashtra, production of tur went up from 4.4 lakh tonnes last year to 20.35 lakh tonnes during 2016-17, bringing down the prices by a huge margin.The total purchase by the government through its agencies at a Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs. 5,050 per quintal was only around 4 lakh tonnes while another five lakh tonnes had been sold at rates lesser than the MSP through the Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMC). Several lakh tonnes remain unsold.But, even during the season of scarcity, rarely do farmers benefit. For instance, even though a consumer paid almost Rs. 220 for a kg of tur dal last year, the farm gate price was just Rs. 45 to Rs. 50, said Dr. Deshpande. Does it take Rs. 170 to convert whole tur to edible tur dal, he wondered.Echoing Dr. Deshpandes views on the cobweb phenomenon, Mr. Srinivas, a progressive farmer from T. Narsipura near Mysuru, said he gave up tomato cultivation this year as many farmers began growing the vegetable on a large scale in the region after it realised a good price.( With inputs f romLaiqh A Khan in Mysuru, B Chandrashekar in Hyderabad, Shoumojit Banerjee in Pune and Alok Deshpande in Mumbai )"

REUTERS/Azad Lashkaril)The UN refugee agency UNHCR this week opened a new camp in northern Iraq to shelter the increasing number of Iraqi families fleeing the fighting in western Mosul, UNHCR said on Friday. Agency spokesperson Andrej Mahecic told a press briefing in Geneva Friday that the camp, the 12th of its kind in response to the ongoing Mosul emergency, was located around 60 km west of Mosul along the highway to Erbil. He said that as of Friday, the new site sheltered nearly 500 children, women and men  96 families in total. It has a capacity to accommodate more than 9,000 people when fully occupied.Less than four weeks ago, UNHCR opened a refugee camp with a capacity for 30,000 people, which is now almost full.According to UNHCR, the risk to people fleeing Mosul is very great. Families arriving from Mosul reported heavy bombing and fighting. They told UNHCR there were no basic services in the city: no food, no water and no fuel. Some families told UNHCR they had been living on one meal a day: often just bread, or flour and water, sometimes supplemented with tomato paste, Mahecic said.He added that six months into the Mosul offensive, UNHCR remained concerned about the continuing massive displacement. Despite enormous risks, the number of people fleeing Mosul showed no sign of slowing down, he told reporters.According to Iraqi authorities, more than 630,000 people have been displaced from Mosul and surrounding areas since October 2016, when the military operation began. This includes more than 434,000 displaced from western Mosul since mid-February of this year.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Agency spokesperson Andrej Mahecic told a press briefing in Geneva, Friday that the camp, the 12th of its kind in response to the ongoing Mosul emergency, was located around 60 km west of Mosul along the highway to Erbil.He said that as of Friday, the new site sheltered nearly 500 children, women and men  96 families in total. It has a capacity to accommodate more than 9,000 people when fully occupied. Less than four weeks ago, UNHCR opened a refugee camp with a capacity for 30,000 people, which is now almost full.According to UNHCR, the risk to people fleeing Mosul is very great. Families arriving from Mosul reported heavy bombing and fighting. They told UNHCR there were no basic services in the city: no food, no water and no fuel. Some families told UNHCR they had been living on one meal a day: often just bread, or flour and water, sometimes supplemented with tomato paste, Mahecic said.He added that six months into the Mosul offensive, UNHCR remained concerned about the continuing massive displacement. Despite enormous risks, the number of people fleeing Mosul showed no sign of slowing down, he told reporters.According to Iraqi authorities, more than 630,000 people have been displaced from Mosul and surrounding areas since October 2016, when the military operation began. This includes more than 434,000 displaced from western Mosul since mid-February of this year.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

In spite of the bumper crop in the face of lingering drought conditions, the produce has no takers from the northern States, thanks to the boom of tomato farming in Rajasthan and parts of Madhya Pradesh, a sudden phenomenon this year.The Madanapalle tomato market, which caters to farmers in over 20,000 hectares in several villages, records 800 tonnes daily during summer, while nearly 70% of the fine varieties invariably reach Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, UP, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. Till last year, the first round of auction would be for the export qualities.Farmers of this region could hardly realise that their produce would become unwanted. For those who do not know things other than tomato-growing and selling and the ambiance of the local market yard, it was news that Rajasthan, the most arid zone in India, also could grow tomatoes, and the farming is slowly spreading downward into some parts of UP and MP.Latest on Thursday, the fine quality tomato was sold at Rs. 4 a kg  the lowest ever this season  as against Rs. 9 last year. Last week, the price stood at Rs. 8 a kg. Threat of further fall even to a rupee or even less looms. The farmers draw solace from the local market pundits who predict fall of arrivals from Rajasthan from the last week of May. They can resume their exports then.Agriculture Market Committee (Madanapalle) chairman Ratakonda Gurappa Naidu told The Hindu that tomato farming had picked up by leaps and bounds in Rajasthan in the last two years, and the stage had now reached a point of exports from there. Till last year, we used to supply tomatoes to northern States in hundreds of tonnes daily. Now, our advance is checked by the Rajasthans sudden boom. The farmers there halted our exports, and we are not going beyond Chhattisgarh, that too in urban areas. The exports fell from over 600 tonnes a day to a meagre 200 or even less now.Perishability factorHe said compared to the southern variety (of Madanapalle), the Rajasthans produce was fast perishable. The produce ready for harvest cannot last longer than three weeks, whereas the Madanapalle variety can sustain up to three months, he said.The market chief, who had studied the exports pattern for a decade, said tomato farming would fail to sustain heat beyond 38 degrees. This is why Madanapalle with its cool climate round the year became the evergreen tomato producing zone. This is for the first time in the local farming history that a northern State has started to threaten domestic farming here, Mr Gurappa Naidu said."

The tomatoes are usually marketed through the daily market functioning in Vazhappadi town.The wholesale traders from Salem, Namakkal, Villupuram and Cuddalore visit this market and procure tomatoes in the auction. There is a spurt in the production of tomatoes this season, leading to bulk arrival in the Vazhappadi market.Due to this, the price of tomatoes has nosedived for the past few days.The price of a box of tomatoes weighing 25 to 28 kg is priced at a paltry Rs. 100. The price is very much on the lower side, the farmers say adding that they will not be able to meet even the expenses involved in raising the crop.Andi, a farmer of Maniyarkundam village, said that farmers managed to raise the crop overcoming heavy odds due to the drought conditions. But the poor price was a matter of shock to them.The fall in the price of tomatoes was unprecedented and tribal farmers were suffering heavy financial loss, he said and demanded the State Government to take steps for providing adequate compensation to compensate the loss."

Cucumbers and lemons are essential during summers. Lemons have become pricey, but those available are not of good quality, she said. A procurement official of a leading retail chain said that cucumbers had been hit severely in the past one month. Their arrival has fallen by more than 60%. Cucumbers are grown in the Malur-Chickballapur belt, which has been hit by drought, he said.A senior HOPCOMS official said that the situation with lemons is no different. Most farmers growing lemons have suffered huge losses. Supply is meagre, he said. Sources said that most of the lemons in the markets today are coming from Andhra Pradesh.Watermelons is suffering a similar fate. A procurement official said that most farmers had shifted to the perennial Kiran variety, creating a huge demand for the Namdhari variety that continues to enjoy widespread patronage among consumers.The supply of beans and carrots, too, has fallen drastically over the last three weeks. Prices have crossed the Rs. 100 per kg mark even in the wholesale market.A kg of haricot beans is trading at Rs. 105  Rs. 135 in the wholesale market. Carrots, the Ooty variety, are being sold in the Rs. 85  Rs. 115 range. The naati variety is being sold for Rs. 85  Rs. 90 a kg. The arrival of beans and carrots in the market are only 30% of the normal level during this time of the year. The places where they are grown  Malur, Kolar and Ooty  are reeling under drought, said a procurement official. The price of brinjals, cabbage, cauliflowers, and beetroot have gone up. Papareddy, a farmer from Chickballapur, said that only those who had used drip irrigation to grow vegetables were able to sustain crops during this period of high temperature and water scarcity. The rest have suffered huge losses. While there has been a good crop of tomatoes, their prices have crashed, he said."

We oppose and condemn the TDP government going ahead with the Swiss Challenge method in spite of opposition from intellectuals and various parties. Instead it should opt for competitive global tenders, Mr. Satyanarayana told reporters.Even YSRC was for having a beautiful capital with all amenities but could not support adopting Swiss Challenge as it would result in virtual loot at the cost of the State resources, he said.He charged the government with not having a policy on providing remunerative price to any crop and effective market intervention coming to the rescue of beleaguered farmers.

The UNI canteen on Rafi Marg was a particular favourite of mine. We used to live in the building next to that of the news agency, so breakfast often meant a plate of idli with sambar and chutney at UNIs open air canteen. Some afternoons I used to stroll down there for a plate of lemon rice or curd rice, pickle on the side, and evenings meant a plate of besan coated potato fries or a crisp vada.The PTI canteen, on the side of the road from where we lived, was not that exciting. I did go there now and then, and had a dosa or some upma, but the fare at the UNI canteen, we all agreed, was far better.Then, of course, we moved out of Rafi Marg. The last time I went to the UNI canteen some years ago, I found that it was not being run by the rotund Swamy we were familiar with, but somebody from Himachal Pradesh. And my last visit to the old PTI canteen (James canteen, it was called) would have been sometime in the late eighties.Actually, I did go there a few days ago, but this time it was to a brand new canteen that has just opened up in PTI. Apparently, its not a canteen, but a caf  PTI news caf. It is on the ground floor of the PTI building on Parliament Street. It caters to the news service housed in the same building, but is open to the public, too, from 8 in the morning till 10 at night.I found a lot of office-goers from the neighbourhood when I went there around lunch time. We had thought wed have a special thaali (Rs. 100) with a plate of chicken (Rs. 100), but it was a Tuesday, so I was told by the man at the counter that there was no chicken on the menu. So we had the special thaali and a plate of idli.I must say it was rather nice. The helpings are large, and the thaali consisted of two tandoori lachcha parathas, paneer, kadhi pakori, bhindi, raita, salad and rice. The parathas were excellent  crispy on the outside, and soft within. The pakori was prepared with spinach and besan, and was pretty good. The paneer, in a light tomato-based gravy, was mildly spicy, while the bhindi, a bit too mashy, reminded me of home. The idli was soft, the sambar was fresh and the coconut-dal chutney wasnt bad either.I am told the evening snacks there are excellent  the samosa is crisp and flaky, and the stuffing of potatoes is tasty without being overly spiced. The aloo bonda, again, has a nice crisp casing, and a stuffing of spiced, mashed aloo. The samosa and bonda are for Rs. 12 a piece, and come with coriander chutney.The menu is a comprehensive one, and has dishes such as chholey bhaturey, rajma chawal and chicken biryani on it. But there was no chicken that day, as I said, and chholey bhaturey and rajma chawal werent a part of the days menu, a helpful gentleman at the counter informed me.I saw that the menu listed moong dal halwa. So I rushed to get some, only to be told that there were no desserts that day. But I suppose since it has just started, they will face some teething trouble. And the lunchtime crowd can get a bit chaotic.Like old Arnie, I shall return. But I will make sure that its not on a Tuesday."

As food and drink establishments proliferate in certain locations, like Lower Parel and Bandra Kurla Complex, there are vast swathes of the city where residents live, but without the kind of dining or drinking options that locals crave.As Pooja Kanodia, who is the restaurateur with her husband, Pankaj, says with a laugh, My neighbourhood is very large, it stretches from Cuffe Parade all the way to Lower Parel. Canto, is a new all-day dining restaurant and bar at Opera House, occupying the spot that was formerly Karma. The Kanodias all-day restaurant and bar is targeting those people that dont want to drive to another part of the city for a night out, and is counting on the fact that there are enough people that would rather visit some place closer, that serves both quality food and drinks, and who want to visit often.Canto, lives up on both counts, with a menu that has been put-together by consultant chef Gracian DSouza, and a bar that features signature tipples by Mukesh Khatri of Bar Solutions. The interiors, by Shweta Kaushik, are transportive, allowing you to imagine a swish Milanese clubhouse, with velvet sofas, lots of green tones and arched windows that let you look out to the street. Says Kaushik of the interiors, They wanted a very vintage vibe, and no distressed finishings at all. A mirrored bar area, with black stone helps set off all the colour, and makes a mean spezie negroni, their twist on the classic cocktail, which comes with citrus infused gin, sweet masala vermouth and Campari bitters.A consideration made during the design process was the ample number of power outlets for those that want to work out of the restaurant, while sampling the eaterys all-day menu. Says Pooja, Weve tried to maintain a very warm and inviting feel. The worry, with an eatery that wants to be everythinga caf, bar, restaurant and hang outis that it ends up falling short on all counts. At Canto, that doesnt seem to be a problem, though its still early days when it comes to how customers see the all-day space, after all it opened in May 2.The food, is of the moment though, and Pooja describes it as being, global fusion. What that translates into on the menu is dishes like the ragda bao and sambar risotto. During the course of our interview though, we sampled less fusion fare, including a highly recommended lamb meatballs, which thankfully, had more of the promised tomato and less of the coconut flavour in its sauce. Also on the menu are au current favourites like the cheesy eggs Kejriwal.Even though a majority of the restaurants in the area are all vegetarian, serving up comfort food, at Canto the menu includes non-vegetarian fare, as the Kanodias wanted the eatery to be inclusive and welcoming to all.Canto, Opera House, Charni Road; 30151537; 12 noon to 1.30 a.m."
5a00cc4d9855b76bf13a48ee,Address it fast,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/626785/address-fast.html,2017-08-06,,Deccan Herald,"Address it fastSudhirendar Sharma, Aug 8 2017, 9:26 ISTFrom being thrown on the streets in Mandsaur to being protected by the police in Mumbai in the past few weeks, tomato has turned out to be the truly red-faced farm commodity in last few weeks.Tomato has joined onion and pulses as the latest victim of price fluctuations that has left farmers and consumers fuming. While farmers were forced to sell tomato at less than Rs 5 per kg, consumers are compelled to buy it at Rs 100 per kg.Price distortions of farm commodities are a continuing phenomenon, as farmers lack control over pricing their own produce. More shocking is the fact that at the receiving end are 30% of rural households who cultivate 82% of arable land in the country.With most landholdings being less than one hectare, the capacity of small holders to bear loss on their produce is anything but suicidal. One farmer suicide every 40 minutes in the country reflects a systemic failure.The crisis amplifies when a previous year high price for a particular crop entices farmers to expand cultivation of the said crop in the following year. Farmers in Andhra Pradesh were shocked when tomatoes fetched Rs 551 per quintal in June this year compared to Rs 3,015 per quintal during the same month last year.Neither was there a drop in consumption of tomatoes nor was there an unexpected glut in the market. And, yet price plummeted like never before. Despite fertilisers and power subsidies, cost of cultivation has been on the increase each year. With farmers not making profit on their small produce (on an average farmers keep 25% produce for home consumption), about 52% of agricultural households are in debt.Average household debt is Rs 47,000. This is unlikely to change as annual income of median farmers is merely Rs 20,000 or just Rs 1,666 per month as per Economic Survey of 2016. That the middlemen and traders are milking large share of the profit is no breaking news. Shocking is the fact that in addition to farmers and consumers bearing the brunt, the state too is at the receiving end of price distortions.Having purchased 8.76 lakh tonnes of onion at a support price of Rs 8 per kg during last five weeks, the Madhya Pradesh State Cooperative Marketing Federation is now forced to sell the same at Rs 2 per kg via the public distribution system.Price distortions have caught the government by surprise too. To avoid onion stocks from rotting over, the Madhya Pradesh State Civil Supplies Corporation could fetch only Rs 2-3 per kg in the open market.One reason for the glut in onion had to do with the Federation purchasing it at a high price which encouraged the farmers from Maharashtra and Gujarat to unload their produce in Madhya Pradesh. However, the cumulative loss to the exchequer in this transaction alone is worth Rs 900 crore.What is true for tomato and onion is equally true for other commodities including pulses. Having stocked two million tonnes of pulses during last two years, crash in market price of pulses has left the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (Nafed) high and dry.All this lends credence to the argument that farmers get no more than 25% of the price that consumers pay, and the minimum support price in the best of circumstances benefits only 6% farmers.Under such conditions, does the governments stated objective of doubling farmers income by 2022 hold any ground? Far from taking the price distortion issue head on, the Niti Aayog instead contends that without additional income from non-farm sources, farmers will not be able to cross income of Rs 18,000 per month even after the doubling efforts.The condition demands a mix of soft and hard options to pull farmers out from the current distress. The soft options include liberalisation of contract farming, direct purchase by processors and bulk buyers, direct sale by farmers to end users etc.The hard options include shifting of the workforce to non-agricultural occupations, an inclusion of supplementary sources of income, modernisation of farming and marketing practices, reforms in land lease and better price realisation.It is clear that none of the options proposed by the Niti Aayog can rid agriculture from prevailing price distortions. If farmers are not assured of remunerative prices for their produce, their interest in farming will wane further.Allow exportsA recent World Bank supported study on Price Distortions in Indian Agriculture by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) suggests a ban on export bans on agriculture commodities to help farmers.The report draws reference to lost opportunity on account of export restrictions on wheat during 2007-2011 subsequent to the lifting of the trade ban wheat exports had touched a high of $5 billion in 2012.The question that begs an answer is whether or not exports directly benefit farmers? Exports do contribute to overall agriculture economics, but do not constitute direct benefit to farmers who are often at the mercy of the unending chain of middlemen.Since farmers income is unlikely to be doubled under the business-as-usual scenario, farmers would need direct cash incentives, in addition to input subsidies, to stay in the business of farming.Improving input efficiency (fertiliser and water) will help farmers make choice of crops to be grown. Crop advisories based on price trends of last few years, transit storage facilities at cluster level, and promotion of cooperative farming can enhance bargaining power of farmers.(Sharma writes on development issues)"

Futuristic looking docking stations, suspended bubble lamps and a wall fronted by space pods with messages flashing on them.It is 2 pm in the afternoon and my younger son, The Foodie and me, have strolled over to New Yorks latest attraction, Eatsa. The eatery has garnered a lot of buzz since it opened for the novel way in which it caters to its patrons. A customer can wander in, browse through the menu, order food, pay and pick up lunch, all without talking to a single human being.Inside Eatsa, a line of gleaming wooden daises with mounted iPads sit like sentinels on duty. We swipe a credit card and the app welcomes Sunita to Eatsa.The menu is divided into Bowls and Bites. But unlike a Starbucks or any of the myriad counter service chains, where there are so many choices and a line of impatient patrons makes you flub your order, here the robot is benign and encourages browsing through the menu.There is a bunch of lunch bowls to select from: Bento Bowl, Burrito Bowl, Smokehouse Salad, No Worry Curry, among others. As always these days in US, displayed prominently above the ingredients for the bowls is information regarding protein, calories, gluten or not, contains dairy or whatnot.I am tempted by many of the bowls: should I get the Toscana bowl? Or should I be adventurous and go for the Cantina Kale salad with jicama, crispy tortilla strips, roasted jalapeno ranch dressing, cilantro, lemon-herb toasted quinoa, green pico de gallo, avocado, green onion, cotija cheese, chipotle black beans, pickled onions, tender kale, and roasted red peppers. Each salad looks tempting and the images inviting.I decide to strike it easy and go for the No Worry Curry: stir fried quinoa with egg, arugula, roasted potatoes, spaghetti squash, pickled onions, red Thai curry, apple-cabbage slaw, curried wonton strips. A preview of the bowl looks delicious and the fact that it has only 660 calories and 17 g of proteins makes me feel thin already.The Foodie decides to challenge the Eatsa android by customizing his own hummus and falafel bowl, removing arugula and tomato cucumber from his bowl of pita chips, tahini dressing, feta cheese, tzatziki, warm lemon-herb toasted quinoa, falafel, kalamata olives, hummus, and harissa. He also orders berry chia parfait from the Bites section and a cold glass of sparkling cucumber melon water.After placing our orders and being thanked politely by the Eatsa cyborg, we scurry over to the next station where the orders are to be fulfilled. This is the best part of Eatsa: a bank of delivery cubbies, with transparent LCD screen as covers.As we wait, with the luminous light of the cubbies throwing a blue sheen on us, I look around. There is a Japanese tourist clicking away with his ubiquitous camera. There is a middle-aged couple looking a bit intimidated at the array of technology. Furtive whispering in a corner and they go out, looking for a restaurant with a human waiter!The order gets fulfilled quickly, not even taking 5 minutes. My name flashes on the screen, with a number next to it, indicating the cubby where my order is to be delivered. The Foodie and I open the screen, take out our order and leave. The entire transaction has taken less than 10 minutes.When we reach home and open our salad bowls, we are pleasantly surprised. The food is fresh, tastefully arranged and just enough for a lunch appetite. The savory flavor of the Thai curry and the red onions, the heartiness of the quinoa, the crunch of the slaw and the wonton strips, all creates a perfect food storm. If anything, the only thing here I would change is the degree of spiciness. For a salad, the chilly content is a bit on the higher side!Eatsas robotic system may sound gimmicky to some dyed-in-the-wool New Yorkers, but we absolutely love it. The second time we walk through its portals, the food android greets me, Welcome back, Sunita. And I almost reach out my hand to pat an old friend on the back!"

Deepak Joshi At the APMC market in Kalyan on Saturday. Deepak JoshiThere has been a split in the ranks of farmers over the decision to withdraw their agitation after a meeting with Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis late on Friday night.A large chunk of farmers criticised the delegation which met the CM and claimed that the strike will continue. The backlash against leaders who were part of the delegation which announced the withdrawal of the strike has been so strong that many of them were forced to make a clarification that the strike has not been called off yet.If farmers think I have made a mistake, then I seek forgiveness from them. If they feel that the strike should continue then I am with them, said Jayaji Suryavanshi, member of the Kisan Kranti Morcha.Suryavanshi seemed to have drawn the maximum ire from farmers who burned his effigies. Visuals of the chief minister speaking into his ears during the marathon four-hour meeting on Friday created a perception that he had struck a deal with the government.This is a decision taken by children of farmers and not by politicians. We have told the state government that if it does not stay true to its promise in the next four months, we will not allow the government to function, Suryavanshi had said soon after the core committee meeting with the CM in which the withdrawal had been announced. However, the backlash the decision received seems to have made many leaders including Suryavanshi rethink their position.Many local farmers were unhappy that the committee decided to take a decision without taking into confidence farmers from across the state.The committee should have heard what the government had to say and then come back and shared the details with farmers. They, however, announced the withdrawal of the strike without any concrete assurances from the state or taking people into confidence. For us they are not a core committee but a chor (thieves) committee and we will continue with the agitation, Bhausaheb Shinde, a farmer from Puntamba in Ahmednagar district, which had become the epicentre of the agitation, said.The Maharashtra Kisan Sabha has also criticised the decision to end the strike.The CM has spun a web around farmers. He has not given any clear assurance. If others want, they can withdraw from the agitation but the Maharashtra Kisan Sabha will continue with its agitation till we receive loan waiver for farmers, said a leader of the Maharashtra Kisan Sabha.Ajit Navale, general secretary of the Kisan Sabha, said, The chief minister did not give a clear answer to any of our demands. The new October 31 deadline that has been declared is a farce the 4-person committee will only announce its findings that day. No concrete decision regarding the waiver of loans or implementation of the Swaminathan report has been taken.Fadnavis has said that the commission shall look into waiving of loans of farmers who have smaller lands. What about Vidarbha or Marathwada, where most farmers have 10 to 15 acres of land, said Navale.The Baliraja Shetkari Sanghatna also criticised the withdrawal and claimed that the government was attempting to create a rift between farmers.I was first invited to a meeting with the CM but was detained by the Pune rural police at Dehu Road police station. I was allowed to go only after the announcement of the strike being called off. This is an attempt to create a rift between farmers, Sanjay Patil Ghanekar, leader of the Baliraja Shetkari Sanghatna, said.Meanwhile, farmers in Nashik held a meeting on Saturday and decided to continue with their agitation including a state-wide bandh on June 5. The farmers meeting also heckled senior BJP leaders including Dindori MP Harishchandra Chavan and BJP MLAs from Nashik Balasaheb Sanap and Devyani Pharande when they tried to attend the meeting, forcing them to leave.In spite of the strike being called off, protests continued in areas like Dindori where women farmers blocked traffic on Kalwan Dindori road. In Saigaon near Yeola in Nashik district, onion and milk were thrown on the road. Similar agitations took place in Jalgaon and Parbhani as well.The decision to call off the strike seems to have had no impact on prices of vegetables which have kept on shooting up in cities like Mumbai. The wholesale price of capsicum jumped from Rs 60 on Friday to Rs 100 on Saturday. Carrot prices increased from Rs 40 to Rs 80, tomato from Rs 30 to Rs 80, brinjal Rs 40 to Rs 80. The price of a bundle of coriander jumped from Rs 100 to Rs 150.Vashi APMC saw nearly 175 vehicles coming into the market. However, the bulk of them were from outside the state.The prices are still high. The decision to take the strike back was taken only late on Friday. The market will remain shut on Sunday. We need to see how farmers react on Monday to the strike call that has been given. Only then will we get a clear picture on when prices can stabilise, Naresh Kor, a trader from Vashi APMC said.Lok Sabha MP Raju Shetti said the people who negotiated with the government were novices and he would hold a meeting of all farmer leaders and groups in Nashik next week to chart out the course of action. The Shiv Sena also criticised the state government and claimed that the state, rather than trying to find a solution, had tried to create a rift between farmers.Rather than trying to sort out the problem, the government seems to have tried to create a rift between farmers. They are just prolonging taking a decision. This is nothing but running away from the problem. It has been the Senas long-standing demand that there should be complete loan waiver for farmers, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The tomatoes cost around Rs 20 to Rs 25 per kilogramme earlier.Tomato sellers assert that because of no supply from Nasik during this season and limited supply from Himachal Pradesh, the rates have skyrocketed. On Saturday, the price went even up to Rs 100. Chandigarh gets its supply of tomatoes from Nasik and Haldwani in normal season which is stopped during the rains.During monsoon, supply of tomatoes comes from Himachal. Now there is a lot of demand for tomatoes and the supply is falling short. Thats why the rates have gone so high, said Desraj, president of Small Vegetable Sellers Association. He added that the rates were expected to hover between Rs 65 and Rs 80 for two more months.Housewives complain that the price of tomatoes are costing more than a packet of paneer. A branded paneer pack of 200 gram costs Rs 60 and tomatoes are costing even more than that. I purchased tomatoes for Rs 100 yesterday from my local vegetable seller. When I asked, he said that he too was paying a hefty price for the tomatoes, said Rashmi, a resident of Sector 21.Many homemakers now prefer to use one tomato in a vegetable. I have told my maid to put only one tomato in any vegetable she cooks. Earlier, she would put at least three. The rates are so high these days that we cant afford to eat tomatoes, said Rajni Lata.Even the hoteliers are using less tomatoes in their vegetables.

The Indian Express had earlier highlighted how farmers sold potatoes at 20 paise per kg at the Pipli grain market in Kurukshetra district. The situation was almost the same elsewhere in the state, too, as there was no mechanism to support the farmers  who were forced to opt for distress sale  even after a bumper potato crop.Khattar claimed that the government has fulfilled almost all the promises made by the BJP ahead of the Assembly polls. Transparency in recruitment for government jobs has been stated as one of his top achievements. It was painful when the youths had to look for sifarish for government jobs.

The prices is unlikely to change for at least two more weeks till the crop is not received from key tomato growing places including Nashik in Maharashtra.Though, every year during June to September, the rates of tomato goes up due to off season, but this year, the crop arrived quite late from Nashik due to heavy rains, which also damaged it to some extent. Due to the rise in prices, homemakers have been forced to cut its daily usage. Tomato is used in the preparation of almost every vegetable and pulses, but due to sky rocketing price we are trying to use it less as possible these days, said Sangeeta Sharma, a homemaker.We have been selling tomato between Rs 55 to 60 per kg in wholesale market and retailers are selling them at Rs 90 to 100 per kg for the past few days and it will continue the same for at least for 10 more days, said a wholesaler Prem Kumar in Jalandhars Maksundan vegetable market. Like Prem, another wholesaler said, We have been receiving very less supply of tomato from key growing states like Maharashtra, Karnataka and other southern states this year. Crops have been damaged in some areas due to heavy rain, which has affected the supply.Dimpy Sachdeva, president Arhtiya Assoication of Maksudan vegetable market, said that though high rate of tomato is a seasonal phenomena but this year the rates shot up much more high as compare to the rates which generally prevail in this off season. He said that they are yet to get the crop from Nashik which got delayed by two weeks due to heavy rains there.Retailers said that they have to bear the transportation charges to ferry tomatoes from mandies to local retail markets and their margins are not very high.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"

Prices for tomatoes at the Dadar market had surged from Rs 15 to Rs 80 per kg for the past couple of days, before cooling down to Rs 50 a kg on Monday. In the suburbs, however, tomatoes continued to sell at upto Rs 100 per kg and coriander at Rs100 a bundle, though daily staples such as onions and potatoes were affordable at Rs18-20 a kg. The supply has greatly reduced and is poor in quality, said Pramod Desai, who owns a vegetable stall in Dadar. He estimates he had to throw out a third of the supply he got Monday, which comes from Nashik.The prices of other commodities rose too. Green peas, usually sold around Rs 80 a kg, were around Rs 120 per kg. The price of cucumbers had almost doubled, selling at Rs 90 instead of Rs 50 per kg. In Byculla, many shops remained shut over the past three days due to unavailability of supplies. We dont have any vegetables, what will we sell? said Aftab Ghaziani, who sells tomatoes.The situation at the Vashi APMC seemed better. The market supply was normalised Monday, according to wholesale traders. However, they expect the prices to be more volatile on Tuesday, as the afternoon supply was disrupted. Today, business was normal, said Nagesh Rao, a wholesale trader.Milk supply hasnt been affected in the city, as most people prefer packaged milk over fresh milk, according to the traders.Buyers have been forced to work with the rising prices. The only solution is to buy fewer vegetables, and hope that the prices stabilise soon. I usually buy 2 kg of tomatoes, but could only afford one the past week, said Prabhadevi resident Huzan Sheikh.At Vile Parle East Market, supply remains short and prices high. We have to charge triple, not even double. Many have been forced into closing shop.

Source: Milind Ghatwai Charred remains of vehicles at Pipliya Mandi, where protesters clashed with traders. Source: Milind GhatwaiFor thousands of unemployed youths who live in villages off the nearly 60-km stretch between Mandsaur and Neemuch in Madhya Pradesh , a solitary soybean plant is the only major hope of employment other than agriculture produce markets or mandis.There are some opportunities in the two towns themselves, famous for licensed opium cultivators and a parallel illegal market, which have brought relative prosperity to this region bordering Rajasthan. In between, however, there are no plants or factories to offer jobs.Job-seekers from these villages have to travel to Ratlam, Pithampur, Neemuch or to Indore, 200 km away. There are a couple of soybean processing plants in Neemuch and a cement factory in Nayagaon, 18 km away, but clearly not enough to absorb them all.After the winter crop is harvested and before sowing for kharif crop begins, youngsters of farming families have nothing on their hands. It was such a crowd that was on the streets from June 1, the first day of what was to be a 10-day strike called in support of fair price for crops.Even the opium growers had protested recently, as also last year, with an entirely different demand. Their protests went largely unnoticed outside because the number of licensed cultivators in Mandsaur, Neemuch and part of Ratlam  the three districts where legal cultivation takes place  is less than 20,000.Forcing vendors not to venture out, throwing onions and tomatoes and spilling milk on the streets, the youngsters roamed in towns and took to highways on their bikes from June 1 to June 4, their aggression increasing by the day.The seeds of the violence that eventually led to the killing of five protesters in firing were sown in Pipliya Mandi town, about 15 km from Mandsaur on the way to Neemuch, on the evening of June 4 when a near 1,000-strong mob forced traders to down shutters.They indulged in hooliganism and loot, insulted shop-owners and their family members. Where will the owner whose shop and house are here go even if he wants to shut the shop down? said a veteran trader, Manohar Lal Jain. Even after curfew was lifted from Pipliya Mandi, the traders were not ready to open their shops until they were provided protection.We only requested them to show solidarity with us by downing shutters, said Sukhlal Patidar of Barkheda Pant village, seated next to Dinesh Patidar, whose 19-year-old son Abhishek was the youngest victim of firing.A complete shutdown and choking of vegetable and milk supplies would have helped us highlight our troubles better because people would have felt the pinch, said Sukhlal. Their refusal to cooperate worsened the situation. When we sell milk we get Rs 22 per litre but if we were to buy it from the market we would have to pay Rs 45. People are ready to buy a water bottle for Rs 20 but refuse to pay that much for what we produce.One trader was so upset by the mob that he chased and beat up a couple of protesters on June 5; the video was widely circulated by farmers among themselves. At least three protesters were beaten and one of them had to be rushed to hospital in critical condition.Do what you want. We wont shut our shops because we have suffered losses. There were just four or five traders but they were adamant, said Sureshchandra Patidar of Chillod Pipliya, at the house of Kanhaiyyalal Patidar, the eldest of the firing victims.The protesters returned and set fire to properties of four traders who had refused to down shutters. Both sides were angry with the local police; the traders felt the police were doing little to control the situation, and the farmers accused them of siding with the traders because of their financial clout.While who exactly fired and under what circumstances is now the subject of a judicial probe, it was amid this volatile situation that two firing incidents took place near Pipliya Mandi on June 6 leaving five protesters dead: a teenager, three under 30, and one aged 44.We had been repeatedly attacked but we kept cool even when some of us were injured, said a police official posted at Pipliya Mandi who cited the tussle between traders and protesters as the genesis of the violence.Describing the plight of the policemen, Home Minister Bhupendra Singh said, They were at the receiving end for days. He had initially claimed that the police had not fired but later said they probably had because Pipliya Mandi police station was under siege.Bumper production, falling prices, demonetisation and alleged involvement of criminal elements all contributed to the anger among farmers; the police firing came amid the standoff between traders and protesters. Since demonetisation, traders who buy produce at mandis gained an advantage that allowed them to manipulate prices and exploit the farmers need for payment in cash, a major factor behind the agitation.The Pipliya Mandi police station, which now resembles a fortress with security personnel milling around, has 65 villages under its jurisdiction. Nearly two dozen vehicles were set on fire by protesters on a 3-km stretch of the highway between Bahi Parshwanath and Pipliya-Mandi, the epicentre that remained out of bounds for authorities for hours on June 6 and 7. Hundreds of youngsters would come out, pelt stones at police or indulge in arson and then melt into nearby fields.Malhargarh Police Station is also on the highway but has only 32 villages under its jurisdiction. It saw far fewer incidents of violence than Pipliya Mandi.There are no job opportunities here. My job as a tempo driver earns me Rs 300 to Rs 400 but I lost even that meagre earning for days. I sat home to save my tempo because if I had ventured out it would have been torched too, said Babloo Pathan of Malhargarh. If you are landless, working on daily wages is the only option, he said, hoping for the situation to improve.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Onion was being sold for just Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh till the state government stepped in to buy, potato is still being sold for 80 paise in Haryana and pigeon pea (tur dal) is fetching no more than Rs 40 in Maharashtra.The glut and plunging prices is the sum total of the crisis staring at farmers across the length and breath of the country. Last week, matters came to a head after farmers protest in Mandsaur of Madhya Pradesh turned violent, resulting in six deaths.Like everywhere else, Mandsaur farmers were agitating after they were forced to sell onions at just Rs1 a kg. The prices are well below what they fetched in 2016: Onion for Rs 1 as against Rs 7, turmeric for Rs 50, half the price in 2016, soya bean at 33% lesser than the rate in 2016 and so on.Farmers blame their plight on demonetisation and the failure of the government to impose adequate import duty on time.Farm economy runs on cash and traders say they have no money to give us. We are forced to sell the produce at whatever price they (traders) are offering, said Jasbir Mamumajra, a sunflower grower from Yamunanagar in Haryana, who blamed demonetisation for his woes.Most of the agriculture trade used to run on cash, mostly unaccounted money, and on credit. With cash being sucked out, the traders have less liquid asset to take risks. In some places they are seeking a commission of up to 2% to make payment in cash.A farm trader in Indias food bowl of Punjab, Devinder Singh, agrees, saying note-bandhi has disturbed the trade cycle. Entire trade shifted to no-credit system. It has hit us hard, he said.An agriculture expert with Bihar government, Anil Kumar Jha, said input costs such as labour, fertilisers and pesticides have gone up significantly this year. This added to the miseries of farmers, already facing cash crisis due to demonetisation.Maharashtra farmers, who were first to protest after prices of pigeon pea (tur dal) fell, blamed the Centre for not imposing high import duty on pulses.The production cost of the tur per quintal is more than Rs5,000 for farmers. With the Union government allowing the import of lentil at Rs 3,700 a quintal, the farmers are not likely to recover their cost, said Vijay Jawandhia, farm activist and Shetkari Sangathana leader.Same was the complaint by farmers in Haryana, who have been forced to sell sunflower at Rs 2,500 per quintal as against the minimum support price of Rs 3,950 even though the cost of seeds have increased by almost 50% in 2016.We could have been saved had the government increased import duty on edible (palm) oil, said Balwinder Singh, a Karnal-based farmer. However, state government officials blamed poor quality for the low price.In Asias largest grain market in Khanna, Punjab, the prices of maize have plummeted with traders like Sanjeev Kumar saying the farmers are bearing the brunt. In Uttar Pradesh, farmers sold wheat at less than the minimum support price, saying government agencies were not willing to buy the produce because of the record production this year.Wholesale traders in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh said the prices of onion, tomato and potato have crashed.The per quintal wholesale prices of the onion in Maharashtra was down to Rs 600-800 from Rs 1,000-1,250 in 2016. Potato in Haryana was sold at Rs 80 a quintal on Tuesday. Farmers sold onion for Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh after which the government announced a procurement price of Rs 8 per kilogram.P Chengal Reddy, founder-chairman of the Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations (CIFA), said: The Centre takes into consideration the average production of past three years and not the current years production cost, in deciding the MSP. If it continues, time is not far when farmers across the country will revolt, he said.(With inputs from state bureaus)"

Why should we have to wait here in this long queue to get aid?We used to have a dream life and weve fallen all the way down to the bottom, said the 38-year-old mother of two, declining to give her full name for fear of reprisals against family members left behind in districts still under jihadist control.IS seized the northern city of Mosul in June 2014 and imposed a brutal form of Islamist rule and a regime of terror on its inhabitants.Life has been made even harder since the battle launched last October by Iraqi security forces to drive out IS. East Mosul and a large part of the west is now back in government hands.In their no-holds-barred defence, the jihadists have used civilians -- caught in the crossfire and already the victims of food, water and electricity shortages -- as human shields.I break the (dawn-to-dusk Ramadan) fast with whatever I can find. Sometimes we even find sand and worms in the water we have to drink, said Umm Mohammed.She was among the women, children and the elderly standing in line amidst the rubble of pulverised buildings and the carcasses of burnt-out cars, many of them protecting their heads from the blistering sun with towels or rags.- What sort of life is this? -Another mother, Umm Yussef, stood nearby in tears, having failed to add her name to the list compiled daily of those entitled to the aid packages of rice, lentils, milk, sugar, tomato juice and cheese.I have 10 children. We break the fast just with water from the well and tomato juice. What sort of life is this? she asked, her voice tinged with both sorrow and anger.Umm Yussef said she would celebrate the Eid feast that follows the Muslim holy month -- at the end of next week -- only once her daughter Leila and their family are freed from Daesh (IS) control.All they have to eat is grass and sand, she said as a passerby handed a biscuit to one of her children.Young volunteers last week handed out 2,000 modest aid packages to inhabitants of areas of west Mosul recaptured by Iraqi forces.We try to meet a modest part of the needs of needy families, said 21-year-old Mohammed Dilan, one of those distributing the aid raised from donations by businessmen and other individuals.For those displaced from Mosul and forced to take refuge in overcrowded camps outside the city, life can be even more treacherous.A mass food poisoning this week at one such camp, Hasansham, left hundreds requiring urgent treatment, officials said Tuesday.Health ministry spokesman Seif al-Badr said around 100 of those affected required serious treatment after the iftar meal which breaks the fast.More than 800,000 people have been forced to flee their homes since the battle for Mosul erupted."

I will make omelettes out of them.Supriyo also took a dig at the politics of BJD and Congress in Odisha, saying the situation in his home state West Bengal was much better.The BJD and Congress have been posing hindrances to central government welfare schemes as a result of which benefits do not reach the poor, he said and added that funds are being siphoned off.At least two of Babul Supriyo's colleagues in the Union Ministry have been subjected to the egg treatment in recent days, mainly by the Congress and Biju Janata Dal (BJD).On Wednesday, Union tribal affairs minister Jual Oram faced eggs and black flags during a visit to Kendrapara. He was less pleased than Babul Supriyo, objecting to the missiles as the protests were anti-adivasi in nature.Oram decided to complain to Union home minister Rajnath Singh since throwing eggs was a breach of security for union ministers and the state government was silent about it.Last Saturday, Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh was greeted with eggs by Congress activists over the death of five farmers in Madhya Pradesh."

The farmers are not even getting the costing of produce. They are in debt and under pressure to give up farming, said Heera Lal Choudhary, vice-president BKS.Farmers are agitated as their produce is not being purchased on MSP and they are not getting water or electricity. During elections, the BJP had promised eight hours of power supply and agricultural connection on a priority basis. After three years, around 4.5 lakh connections are still pending, said Choudhary.BKS is holding an indefinite mahapadav at seven divisional headquarters  Jaipur, Kota, Jodhpur, Udaipur, Bikaner, Bharatpur and Sikar. BKS representatives submitted an 11-point memorandum to the district administration for the chief minister.The government had appealed to farmers to ensure a good harvest, but they cheated us after a bumper production by changing their import-export policy and purchasing pulses from outside, said Choudhary. BKS is a non-political outfit working in the interest of farmers, he said.The mahapadav is a fight for the financial independence of farmers, Heera Lal Choudhary, vice-president BKS has said. (Himanshu Vyas\ HT Photo )He said both the BJP and the Congress have cheated farmers. During elections they make promises and after coming to power they forget their promises. Farmers will prosper when they get the right price. We will go to all levels to get our voices heard. Political parties will get our reply during elections, said Choudhary.Addressing the farmers at the sit-in, state BKS president Mani Lal Lebana said, This mahapadav is to give the government a chance.The government has pay commissions, but what about farmers? We are not getting the right price for our produce. The government is not listening to our demands. They will face the consequences during elections, Sua Lal, a farmer from Pachaar area of Jaipur, said. He added that this year he sold tomatoes at 2 per kg, which should have fetched him 20 a kg. We did not earn even prices of the seeds, he said.Another farmer, Kailash Sharma said, We sold pea at 3 per kg. The seeds cost 200 per kg. What have we earned? If no steps are taken by the government, we will then close villages and block roads.The state government has cancelled the leave of district collectors and police officials in view of the protest and has asked them to keep a close watch on the situation. Security has been tightened in areas around the mahapadav sites. (Himanshu Vyas\ HT Photo )Not only Jaipur, farmers from Ajmer, Jodhpur and Bharatpur too have joined the agitation. Hundreds of farmers held an indefinite dharna at Azad Park, Ajmer.The farmers submitted a memorandum to the divisional commissioner in demanding warehouses at each panchayat headquarters, 247 uninterrupted electricity supply to farmers during sowing season, and adequate representation of farmers in district committee meetings discussing agricultural issues. The farmers are under great economic crisis, said Rajendra Sharma district secretary BKS.In Jodhpur, farmers sat on mahapadav outside the district collectors office. Sangh coordinator Tulchharam Sinvar said the farmers want minimum support price for their produce."

""Where I was spending one riyal on each item, now it is double that.""Ajit has come up with a solution to cope with the rising food prices in Doha -- cut down to just one meal a day.The 31-year-old is typical of the nervous migrant workforce.As the crisis imploded, discussion has largely focused on the political and security aspects of the row between some of the globe's richest countries in one of the world's most volatile regions.But outside the corridors of power, it is Qatar's foreign workforce - totalling more than two million, mostly from south Asia -- who are on the frontline when it comes to the immediate impact of the crisis.While Qatar's Western expats are likely to ride out the economic impact, there is no such luxury for Ajit and his colleagues.The rising price of staple foods is just one of their fears.Concerns are also growing about job security and the lack of much-needed overtime as economic uncertainty grows, due to what Doha has labelled the ""blockade"" imposed by neighbouring countries.""I have heard people saying there will be no more jobs in Qatar,"" added Ajit.A short distance away stood Anil, a 32-year-old scaffolder from Bangladesh, in blue overalls and a purple face-cover to shield from the fierce summer sun.He was resting after a morning of labour in heat of 48 degrees Celsius (118 Fahrenheit) in the rundown Doha suburb of Mshereib that is being transformed into a gleaming cafe, hotel and business area ready for the 2022 football World Cup.""Everybody is talking about this problem (the crisis),"" said Anil, 32. ""Some people are saying they may send us home.""In just one week since Qatar was cut off, Anil said the price of the apples he buys has more than doubled, from seven to 18 riyals per kilo (two pounds).""I've heard Qatar is supporting terrorists and that's why they've been blockaded,"" said Abdulbariq, 38, an electrician.The Bangladeshi uses the money he earns -- 820 riyals a month -- to send his two daughters to school in India.""This will affect them,"" he fears.The Gulf crisis could not have hit the workforce at a worse time.Because of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, working hours have already been reduced and there is no chance to make up any shortfall through overtime.That though is only a temporary measure.Although Qatari officials have, so far, confidently shrugged off the economic impact of isolation, that view is not shared on the country's many construction sites.""I have a father, brother, mother and sisters to look after, I send home 1,500 riyals a month,"" said Noor-ul-Islam, a 26-year-old mason from Bangladesh.""Definitely there will be problems for my family if this crisis continues."""

PTI Photo Prannoy will take on Japans Kazumasa Sakai, while compatriot Srikanth will face Korean second seed Son Wan Ho in the semis. PTI PhotoChen Long lost 21-18, 16-21, 21-19 to Indian HS Prannoy in Indonesia, and declared he was operating at a 90 percent of his potential. 9 out of 10 shots of that beastly game that won the Olympic gold in Rio are still formidable, even if Long has only won the Asian Championships since the Games and his last Super Series win came in October of 2015.So Chen Long isnt a prolific champ on the circuit like Lee Chong Wei and neither does he carry the reputation of being unbeatable like Lin Dan at his peak.But what Chen Long most certainly is, is a massive looming presence on court when he stalks the net, a champion whose physical prowess masks his ability to be deceptive, and a good, self-respecting Chinese defensive automaton even at 90 percent who can retrieve till the end of time.Against this force of nature, 24-year-old Prannoy, displayed a wide array of strokes and wits to match in the 75-minute-long encounter. No matter how fragmented the drive and motivation of the two, Prannoy can always claim he beat the Olympic silver and gold medallists on two successive days at the Indonesian Open, playing like a bonafide top contender.There is nothing wrong in losing to a top world player, Chen Long would admit later, even as he admitted he was still testing his skills and collecting points at tournaments this year, and the last 10 percent would be summoned at the Worlds.But first the fairytale of Fantastic Friday for the Indian. Coach Pullela Gopichand talks about his wards aggression as an entity that in Prannoy best stays sheathed.The young man has a bit of a reputation at the academy. He can be excessively scary at times, and his opponents feel it on court, the coach explains. Long might be a beast towering over the court, but Prannoy is known in Indian circles as the big man, not the lightest around, with unconfirmed six-pack abs but an eminently confirmed power-punch in his game.Hes not someone Gopichand had to tutor in aggression. You dont need to show it if you have it inside you  opponents are automatically scared, he says.It was perhaps why he never looked overpowered by the massive Chinaman even in rallies he didnt dominate. Coupled with some sharp movements and a body defense so assured that he exuded confidence when he merely retrieved shuttles without breaking a sweat, Prannoy was ready for a follow-up to his biggest win of his career in terms of rankings  against Chong Wei.He would strike an awkward length that caught Long near his shoulder and smashes that didnt waver out of the lanes. In fact such was Prannoys control on the steep smashes played to the lines coupled with a very respectable netgame that Long was rattled into spraying his own smashes. The Indian would open up a lead at 8-14 in the first and with a lovely tumble-shot at the net pocket the opener to give himself a good look-in into Longs iffy game.His attack mightve been tepid, but his defense is intimidating and at 13-11 in the second set, Longs low stretched retrieve at midcourt just flicked inches off the ground would end a winner, as he would level the sets. Still, Prannoy was constructing his points well, his aggression leashed to follow a plan that Indonesian coach Mulyo Handoyo instructed.In two pristine points, Prannoy would do what Handoyos most illustrious ward Taufik Hidayat did: use the boom smash from back court as a set-up point and rush to the net for the soft kill. Like chip-and-charge in tennis, Taufik had mastered the loading and release of the manouvre, and Prannoy would neatly execute the drill  something thats worked a dozen years against Chinese of the last generation and charmingly Indonesian.Still, it was expected that the Olympic champ would strike back soon enough. At 4-7, Prannoy was staring at a Set 3 taper off; except he wasnt in a mood to let go. He would smash-and-charge to level at 12-all, and thereafter refuse to blink in long rallies using the block at the net and an angled crosscourt as a variation.A bit of luckAt 18-17 came the moment of the match  one of the best in Indo-Chinese shuttle lore. The rally was lengthening and Prannoy would effect a diving retrieve and Chen Long would go for a net kill and almost begin to pump his fist when the Indian stuck his backhand in the way to send it right back over the net. 19-17. A smash, and a slice of luck later, Prannoy induced an error from Long, with nerves not fiddling with his calm plans.Mulyo would look ecstatic, as Prannoy went down on one knee to soak in the moment. Beating a Chinese is a big thing in our country, he would tell BWF later, adding, since yesterdays win, everyone was again excited about badminton.In his 4th meeting with Long, Prannoy had decided to not plan. Frankly speaking I didnt prepare for today, he would stun the local reporters before candidly adding, The way Chen Long won yesterday, 21-7, 21-9, I didnt want to watch, that wouldve played with my head and Id have started thinking its so tough. Ive played him before so I knew what to expect. All I told myself was pick one shuttle more than Chen Long.The lead-up to Indonesia hadnt been a happy one. He was pulled out of the Sudirman squad and asked to work on his fitness by Gopichand.Playing Chen Long is always physically tiring. He doesnt make mistakes, always keeps shuttle in play. But today in last set, I was not getting tired. Physically I felt very sound and confident. That was important, he said.Training with Mulyo has meant longer sessions than what they had earlier thatve been back-breaking for all of Indias top mens singles players. Training is physically tiring, everyday he pushes us. But thats whats getting us the big wins in Super Series, he added.His roommate K Srikanth would also make the semis and will play his big match against Korean World No.1 Son Wan Ho on Saturday after a straight sets win. Indian current players are attacking and they dont mind training hard and have a great will to train a lot, Mulyo would concur, talking to reporters. I want to be with them till they reach international championships at the top regularly, he added.In Prannoys case, Mulyo has found explosive power in the backhand. There is a solidness to his backhand, Gopichand said. Its an unorthodox backhand, raw power with weapons. Weve not worked on it much, its been like this for 8 years  the power and angles on the backhand. The legend is set to grow after two back-to-back wins over shuttles biggest names.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

5a03ab359855b76bf13b8fbf,Green tales from India’s gardens,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2017/jun/19/green-tales-from-indias-gardens-1618572.html,2017-06-20,,The New Indian Express,"After travelling to Pune, Ahmedabad, Delhi, Mumbai, and Hyderabad, Tracing Narratives will be showcased in Chennai.Hosted by the Chennai Architecture Foundation, the exhibition will follow our countrys connect with gardens.CHENNAI: Humans have always had an intrinsic compatibility with nature; the idea of paradise is, after all, a garden lush-green with plants, fruit laden trees and flowery bushes. Be it in our painting patrons, romantic songs in cinemas shot in expansive tulip fields or garden-like sets  India has always had a soft spot for its green. The vast history of gardens and landscape design in India has been compiled into an enthralling exhibition, Tracing Narratives, to be exhibited in Chennai from today, hosted by the Chennai Architecture Foundation as part of Landscape Week.We were beginning to ask ourselves, what the idea of Indian gardens is. We typically ended up discussing the gardens associated with temples, palaces or Mughal and colonial gardens. But for a vast subcontinent like India, these cannot be the only expressions of gardens over time, explains Aniket Bhagwat, a leading landscape architect based in Ahmedabad.As part of Landscape Environment Advancement Foundation (LEAF), which was founded by his father, late Prof Prabhakar B Bhagwat in 2003, they set up a million garden initiative, asking people to send in names of places they felt constitute a garden. This brought up places that we normally dont consider as gardens. For example, a place in the middle of the desert in Kutch, Kala Dungar, where a priest feeds wolves, an ancient crater that had become a lake around which there are many gardens and temples, Aniket recalls.This expanded their idea of what a garden meant. They then began questioning why landscape architecture, instead of being celebrated, is being disregarded. We concluded that its perhaps a fault in our genesis. The genesis of landscape architecture as a profession is the idea of the garden. Theres a huge embedded relationship gardens have in our culture. Because of our over-intellectualising things and assuming that we know our genesis, we have actually forgotten our basis, and fractured it, he rues.LEAF dissected and researched on gardens in India over two years, the result of which is a monograph called Tracing Narratives and a travelling exhibition of the same name. Dedicated to two landscape architects of India  Prabhakar B Bhagwat, Indias first landscape architect, and Mohammad Shaheer, who was involved in restoration of Humayuns garden, Agra  Tracing Narratives eloquently documents the idea of gardens and landscapes in India. Through over a 100 panels, it redefines the whole idea of what a garden is  a not just typical conventional park with trees and shrubs, but also waters structures that dot rivers and tanks, like Abhaneri stepwell in Rajasthan, gardens attached to temples, cemetery gardens, step wells, folklore, etc.The exhibition takes you through literature, paintings, cinema, documents and photographs, with interesting nuggets of information  for instance, did you know that tomatoes were introduced in India from England by the Agri-Horticultural Society of India, in 1857? From works of literature where gardens formed prevalent backdrops, it goes to 19th Century paintings of colonial gardens, the use of landscapes in old and contemporary cinema. Important botanists, horticulturists, writers, foresters and their contributions have also been acknowledged. The voices of various gardens are given a platform  the ancient Mughal gardens in Himalayan backdrops, projects by landscape architects, like the rehabilitation of an old quarry into a forest teeming with over 40 species of birds and trees, intricately illustrated with photographs and illustrations.Weve done this to educate ourselves first. It became an exhibition as a matter of chance, Aniket says, adding that it seems to be bringing the discussion about landscapes to the fore. Exhibitions can have a strange way of affecting the mind. They dont always affect you immediately. A residual idea stays in your mind and keeps niggling at you for a long time, he remarks. The exhibition will be held in Auroville, Kochi and Bengaluru.Expect to be enthralledBooks, movies and paintings which depict landscape and gardensVisual Journey through several gardens across India, from Srinagar to VizagUnderstanding agricultural patterns and highwaysHow invasive species were introduced in IndiaHow nurseries came into existence in IndiaPersonalities who influenced the discipline of landscape designBooks and volumes that document and guide gardening practicesPractitioners of gardening and stunning landscape architecture examplesThe exhibition will be held till June 26,and will be inaugrated today at 5pm, at Lalit Kala Akademi.

Its only twice in a year that the Centre announces support price, based on which the state government also fixes support price.He also informed that a national-level workshop on fixing agriculture prices has been organised at Bengaluru on June 24 and 25. Officials and resource persons from the Central Government are expected to attend the workshop.On the rise in prices of tomato, maize and also arecanut, Kammaradi said its essential to plan according to the produces at district-level with the deputy commissioner tasked with the same.While Dakshina Kannada district is known for black pepper, Haveri district is known for Hebbevu tree cultivation. One can be assured of at least Rs 2.5 lakh income per tree in just six years, he added.Kammaradi said that Chikkamagaluru district, however, has witnessed a dip in ragi cultivation at 16,600 hectares of land, while maize has been cultivated in 21,000 hectares of land. The cultivation of sunflower has dwindled, while 23,000 hectares of land is out of farm activities.The Centre has fixed Rs 5,050 support price per quintal for tur dal while the state government has fixed Rs 450 in addition to it. However, the merchants at APMC yards have been buying the same for a lesser price at Rs 3,500 per qunital. Such issues can be addressed, if group trading is encouraged at markets.To encourage farming further, the state government is all set to cultivate lands at selected eight districts including Kalaburagi, Haveri, Belagavi and other districts. As per the plan, the government will deploy all its schemes and technology of Krishi Vigyan Kendra.The government has already released Rs 25 lakh aid towards the same, he said.Not ignoring the needs of farmers, health cards are being issued to them and also soil card to ensure fertility of the soil, Kammaradi said."

Already hit by plunging prices for the crops he grows in his five-acre family farm in Maharashtras Pimpalgaon Dukre village of Nasik district, he is now staring at abject penury.The state government is set to acquire 50,000 acres of land for the Rs 46,000-crore Mumbai-Nagpur super communication highway to bring development to the backward regions of Vidarbha and Marathwada, but Waghchowre fears it will spell doom for him and his family.The proposed eight-lane highway would eat up four acres of his land holding. We survive and get by because of our land. You take this away from us and we are left with nothing. Not even hope, rues Waghchowre.Watch | Why are Indias farmers seething with anger?Sharing his apprehension are 3,700 farmers in Nasik alone who have registered their objections after receiving the government notification for acquisition of their land. Incidentally, 84% of the land earmarked for the highway project is agricultural.Already caught in the spiral of high input costs and diminishing returns, the highway project is another reason for disquiet among local farmers. The recent farmers protests in north Maharashtra were triggered by the governments land acquisition policies among others.Not just this expressway, but all big-ticket projects cheat farmers, said Ulka Mahajan, an anti-land acquisition activist who had led the protests against the Mahamumbai Special Economic Zone in Raigad. Many farmers agree that road projects such as the Mumbai-Nasik highway will essentially leave them by the wayside.Their list of grievances against the government is long. Top among them is the administrations alleged lack of transparency in land acquisition. Farmers say no social impact assessment was done and the issue of compensation to landless labourers was ignored.They are also not impressed with the price  four times the current market rate  that the government is offering selectively. Our land is irrigated and we can grow crops the whole year round. I dont think you can put a price on that in Maharashtra, said Dhanaji Waghchowre, Shantarams brother.Farming has mostly ceased to be profitable, pushing more and more farmers into a deadly debt trap. According to estimates, 1,129 farmers committed suicide between January and May this year. Majority of these suicides are from Vidarbha and Marathwada, where farmers practice dryland farming. And many of those who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods dont want to give up their lands because theres no viable alternative. The three Waghchowre brothers are among them.As far as Shantaram remembers, the last time he made a killing was in September 2013. Then, he had got Rs 5,000 for a quintal of onions. Belonging to the vegetable belt of Nasik, Shantaram made a cool Rs 2.5 lakh by selling his 50 quintals onions to the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC).Prices have gone downhill since, and so has his financial well-being. 2013 was the best thing to have happenedThis year the price is down to Rs 350 a quintal. I wont even recover my input costs, he said.Farmers spill milk on the road during a demonstration protest over various demands in Nasik. (PTI FILE PHOTO)With onions bringing him tears, he has scaled down his ambitions. A farmer lives on hope. I wont plant onions across my five acres but half an acre is my gamble. Something might pay off, he said. Nearly 40 quintals of unsold onions lie covered under a tarpaulin outside his mud and thatched house adjacent to his field.Onions, however, are just one of Shantarams many problems. Novembers demonetisation hit the family hard and curtailed their access to cash. Then ready-to-harvest tomatoes were lost in a hailstorm in May, resulting in a loss of Rs 40,000. The family thereafter also lost one of its bullocks and the tilling of land in the new sowing season suffered a setback.The Waghchowres are the typical small Maharashtra farmer with three brothers and their families living off the five-acre field. But what separates them from the rest is their irrigated land, courtesy a well and a pipeline that brings water from the Kadwa river nearby. Not every Maharashtria farmer is as lucky, with only 18% of land tilled in the state being irrigated.Report card This is what a Maharashtra farmer got from his farm this year,SS a reason for his anguish Soil quality No soil health card yet from the government Water source: Irrigated by a well and a direct pipeline from the river nearbyNote: This year has been good but in the past, they have faced problems in getting payments on time This is what a Maharashtra farmer got from his farm this year,SS a reason for his anguishIrrigated by a well and a direct pipeline from the river nearbyThis year has been good but in the past, they have faced problems in getting payments on timeShantaram and his two brothers feel that though life isnt exactly good, it could have been much worse without the land. Besides onions, they grow tomatoes, brinjals and sugarcane. Their field is normally lush green even at the height of summer. But that does not necessarily translate into a windfall as there are too many imponderables plaguing the farm sector, including unseasonal rains, pest attacks and price fluctuations.Shrinking profits and heightened unpredictability have put the family in a quandary. The money the brothers make is just enough to feed the family of 10, but inadequate to service their debts. A far bigger challenge at the moment for them is to get Dhanajis daughter Suvarna into a college.The girl has just passed Class 12, the first to do so in the family, but is facing an uncertain future.Where will a farmer get Rs 70,000 by the end of the year for college expenses? asked her mother Sunita. Despite bountiful production, hope is in short supply among farmers of Maharashtra.This is the second part of HTs series, #BeingaFarmerNow. Part 1 focused on the new age farmers of Madhya Pradesh."

The increases for these two grains were also the greatest since 2012/13."

(PTI Photo, File) Nagpur: Farmers throwing vegetables on a road during a protest as part of the Maharashtra bandh over various demands in Nagpur, Maharashtra on Monday. (PTI Photo, File)A HUNDRED years after Mahatma Gandhi led a movement of indigo growers against their oppressor landlords in Bihars Champaran district, farmers of Maharashtra launched an unprecedented strike early this month. But unlike the Champaran Satyagraha, this was a movement led by farmers themselves. It started with farmers from Puntamba, a sleepy village in Ahmednagar district, deciding at a Gram Sabha meeting in April to stop supply of all produce to cities from June 1. That resolution was subsequently adopted by farmers in villages across Maharashtra, culminating in a stunningly successful strike lasting almost 11 days.The striking farmers not only shut down wholesale produce markets and blocked highways to prevent delivery trucks from reaching urban centres, but also even dumped milk and vegetables on the streets. The Maharashtra government was, then, forced to constitute a Cabinet subcommittee of five ministers to hold consultations on the main demands that included a complete waiver of institutional farm loans and remunerative crop prices based on theM S Swaminathan reports formula of 50 per cent returns over cost. These demands were accepted in principle, following which the strike was called off. The collective might of farmers had clearly triumphed over the all-powerful state.The Maharashtra farmers agitation was remarkable for not only its seeming spontaneity and absence of any towering leader, but also it happening in an above-normal rainfall and bumper agricultural harvest year. Such protests one would have normally expected in the event of losses from drought, especially of the kind seen in 2014-15 and 2015-16.But as the accompanying table shows, the Maharashtra government infused around Rs 20,939 crore during the two consecutive drought years through time-honoured relief measures such as crop loss compensation, insurance claims and labour payments under MGNREGA. In addition, rescheduling of crop loans and reduced interest on these  plus the state governments ambitious Jalyukta Shivar programme of water and soil conservation in 25,000 drought-prone villages  turned out to be significant interventions.The trigger for the current farmers agitation has not been any natural calamity-driven distress, which was, on the whole, deftly handled by the state government. Instead, it has primarily been prices.A bumper crop resulting from good rains had ignited hopes among farmers of setting-off their losses from previous years. But what they encountered was a price crash across crops  from cereals and pulses to vegetables and fruits.Take pulses, where the Centre, in a bid to promote their cultivation to bridge domestic shortages, raised the minimum support price for tur (pigeon-pea) from Rs 4,625 to Rs 5,050 per quintal. Farmers obliged by increasing production, but the government failed to honour its promise. Far from getting the promised rate, farmers had to dump tur for as low as Rs 3,000 per quintal. Even during peak summer, they realised hardly Rs 5 per kg for tomatoes, onions and other vegetables.In short, farmers suffered more with record production on the back of good rains than when there was crop failure from drought.A second trigger for the stir was the crop loan waiver announcement by a newly-elected government in Uttar Pradesh, which took place around the same time prices were crashing. Farmer organisations admit that waiving loans cannot be a real solution, but say that it will have a soothing effect in the present context. At the least, it will bring many farmers back into the formal credit system. Also, if there can be a farm loan waiver in UP, then why not in Maharashtra?What is clear from the above is that the risk of price fluctuation in agricultural commodities isnt covered by any of the existing government relief mechanisms. The need of the hour is a framework that insulates farmers from the shocks of not just natural calamities, but also market price crashes. And loan waiver cannot provide any sustainable solution.That said, the Maharashtra farmers agitation  and the state government having to eventually concede to an unconditional loan waiver  is a game-changer, simply for showing how even an otherwise unorganised class can successfully express and negotiate demands. Organised labour unions, not to speak of industry associations like FICCI and CII, are known for constantly engaging in promoting and protecting the interests of their members. Farmers have had no such arrangements for collective lobbying. In this case, though, ordinary farmers under the most lugubrious conditions stood firm on their demands, resisting attempts to divide and weaken their ranks.The following elements may have contributed to the invisible glue of emotional unity among Maharashtras farmers: * Insensitive statements against farmers by some responsible public figures even amidst tumbling crop prices. Similar statements from top bankers (and also the financial regulator) against loan waivers and the possible adverse impact on repayment culture would only have further fuelled resentment among farmers.* The photos/videos of farmers ploughing back their onion and tomato crops because of not being able to afford the additional cost of harvesting. These images went viral on social media and were exchanged by farmers with one another. n Drying up of credit post-demonetisation from cooperatives, the lifeline of farmers in Maharashtra. They were, then, compelled to approach commercial banks and moneylenders for credit on far less favourable terms.* A spike in suicides, including in northern Maharashtra, the countrys top onion and grape producer. The latter belt has been the epicentre of the strike. The losses to its farmers have been more, as they grow a host of cash crops entailing higher investment and also exhibiting greater sensitivity to price crashes. These farmers are generally more well-off, educated and combative. They, not surprisingly, provided the leadership for the movement.* A sustained public debate on farm debt waiver in the last two years, amidst talk of loan write-offs for big corporates. The Oppositions Sangharsh Yatra and also a ruling coalition partners Atmakalesh Yatra marches in support of loan waiver would only have created the perfect pitch for the farmers strike.These elements established a common chord of angst amongst lakhs of farmers, culminating in a state-wide agitation. This is a classic example of collective behaviour driven by group dynamics that leads people to engage in unthinkable acts under unusual circumstances, as was propounded by the American social scientist Robert E Park. And nobody could have imagined that the success of Maharashtras farmer strike would pave the way for similar demands elsewhere, including in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Express Archive) Haryana Agriculture Minister Om Prakash Dhankar. (Source: Express Archive)AFTER FARMERS in Haryana were forced to sell potatoes for as low a price as 20 paise per kg, the BJP government in the state is thinking of creating a system to help peasants whenever they resort to distress sale. State Agriculture Minister Om Prakash Dhankar on Wednesday said the government has planned to offer some sort of support price to such farmers for crops like potatoes, tomatoes, cauliflower and onion, which are currently outside the ambit of MSP (Minimum Support Price).Recently, The Indian Express had highlighted how farmers sold potatoes at 20 paise per kg at the Pipli grain market in Kurukshetra district.We have discussed this issue with the chief minister today to explore how prices of these vegetables can be stabilised. If there are good prices for such crops, then the government may levy more taxes especially on the commission agents so that the government can offer money from this fund to the farmers in case of a drop in prices, said Dhankar, a former national president of the BJP Kisan Morcha.When asked about the waiver of farm loans by neighbouring states, Dhankar said, We are working to make farmers self-sufficient instead of depending on loans by aiming to increase their income to Rs 1 lakh per acre. However, it is a reality that farmers in all corners of the world require assistance in the form of subsidies as the agriculture sector does not result in earnings as high as that of the service sector.The Haryana farmers are on the warpath alleging that their crops were being purchased at throwaway prices this year. Keeping in view the stir, the state government on Wednesday decided to buy 50 per cent of the sunflower crop at MSP.Till now, it had been procuring just 25 per cent of the crop at MSP, which is Rs 3,950 per quintal.In the absence of MSP, the farmers were forced to sell the sunflower crop at the rate of around Rs 2,500 per quintal.For the time being, the farmers have decided not to sell their sunflower crop at throwaway prices. We want that 100 per cent crop of sunflower of the farmers be purchased at the rate of MSP otherwise it has no meaning, said Gurnam Singh Chaduni, president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, Haryana.The farmers have announced to stage a half-naked protest at the grain market of Shahbad Markanda (Kurukshetra) on June 24 when Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar would go to the town to address a rally.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

They are starchy and since, rice is a staple food in South India, people are enjoying Risotto and Paella. The restaurant serves them in combination with seafood and mixed meat as well. For starters, there is a platter with pita bread, hummus, assorted vegetables and tabbouleh made with broken wheat mixed with finely chopped parsley and assorted celery. It is served in a thali, an Indian accent to the festival. The tabbouleh tastes grainy with a tinge of bitterness from the parsley. The toasted pita bread has a crunch.If you prefer something mushy and creamy, go for Risotto. Risotto Alla Promaveera is a vegetable risotto with seasonal veggies including carrots, broccoli and bell peppers, and cheese. This rice dish is creamy and served with garlic bread. Prepared with South Italys most famous rice arborio and cooked with proper rice-water proportion, the chicken risotto is starchy. Topped with fibrous chicken cubes, the rice has longer grains than its vegetarian counterpart.Paella is a mix of ingredients such as saffron, green beans, pepper and tomatoes with seafood or chicken for the non-vegetarians. The warm vegetarian paella tastes more like Indian biryani as it is masaledaar, but it isnt too spicy. It was a bit dry in consistency. The seafood paella looks appealing, bright and colourful. It has the right consistency, like Indian khichdi, topped with shrimps and salmon, and has a flavour of saffron.For desserts, try baklava served with mango paste and mango yoghurt on a graphite stone. The sweet baklava is crunchy. The mango paste tasted of pure mango. With a few small mango pieces on the top, the yogurt is really good.The Paella and Risotto festival is on till June 25.Cost for two: Rs 1,500."

When a TV show is adapted from a book, there is the inevitable clash between the book and the show on whether the series does justice to the book. TV shows give a grand canvas to some great stories and make them come alive for audiences.Be it age-old classics, whodunnits with quirky detectives or new-age fiction novels, some of the best shows from BBC First are now airing in India. Heres a list of 10 best Brit TV series adapted from books.1. WAR AND PEACEOne of Tolstoys finest literary achievements, this novel chronicles the history of the French invasion of Russia and the impact of the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society through the stories of five Russian aristocratic families. Though the novel has been adapted multiple times for both the big and small screen, one of the best adaptions by far is BBCs six-part adaptation of the novel written by Andrew Davies and directed by Tom Harper. This series is being aired on Zee Caf every Monday. The critically acclaimed series was placed at #5 by The Telegraph (UK) in its list of the greatest television adaptations of all time, stating It is safe to say that this is the greatest TV costume drama of the past decade and has raised the bar in a genre for which we are already renowned all over the world.2. PARTNERS IN CRIMEThis six-part drama finally saw Tommy and Tuppence take their rightful place alongside Poirot and Marple as iconic Agatha Christie characters. It showcased Agatha Christies 1922 novel The Secret Adversary and 1941 novel N or M?. This compelling new adaptation, with Christies much-loved characters Tommy and Tuppence, a married couple who solve crimes together, is a favourite among fans old and new.3. PRIDE AND PREJUDICEThis 1995 award-winning adaptation by Andrew Davies from Jane Austens 1813 novel of the same name elevated Colin Firth to stardom! His portrayal of the legendary Mr Darcy caught the imagination of fans across the globe. Pride and Prejudice was critically acclaimed and was honoured with several awards, including a BAFTA Television Award for Jennifer Ehle for Best Actress and an Emmy for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Costume Design for a Miniseries.4. MAIGRETBeing telecast on Zee Caf every Friday, this crime drama is an adaptation of the Maigret books based on a fictional French police detective, actually a commissioner of the Paris Brigade Criminelle. Maigret is a popular character created by writer Georges Simenon around which seventy-six novels and twenty-eight short stories were published between 1931 and 1972. In this BBC First production, Rowan Atkinson, the actor who has so far tickled your funny bone as Mr Bean, will now be seen essaying the role of Jules Maigret. Rowans portrayal of the French detective makes you forget that he was ever Mr. Bean and truly distances himself from his iconic comedic roles. Rather than pulling funny faces, he adopts a forlorn, furrowed demeanour. Rowans portrayal of the pipe-smoking Maigret has been acclaimed by critics as brilliant and a masterclass in understatement. Rowan as Maigret is a gruff, but patient and fair, brooding sleuth puffing contemplatively on his pipe as he attempts to solve the latest grisly murder on the streets of Paris in 1950s.5. ABOVE SUSPICIONThis crime drama is based on the series of Anna Travis novels written by Lynda La Plante and stars Kelly Reilly and Ciarn Hinds as the lead protagonists. The show follows the work of D.C. Anna Travis played by actress Kelly Reilly, a rookie detective determined to prove herself in the male-dominated police department by solving a trail of gruesome murders left by an unknown serial killer. About her role, Reilly had said, Well, shes not a political character like Jane Tennison, shes not fighting her ground and its almost like she just doesnt care. She has an insouciance she wears those skirts and those heels, and while I dont think she uses her femininity or anything like that, she just doesnt hide it. Theres a dilemma for the audience, because normally your prejudices would invite you to dismiss a woman like her who seems a bit awkward and wears tight skirts. But she brings something fresh in among those hackneyed male detectives.6. WOLF HALLThe critics have been unanimous in their praise of the six-part series adaptation of two of Hilary Mantels novels, Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies. The historical drama is a fictionalised biography documenting Thomas Cromwell through his rise in social hierarchy. This series has received the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series while Review aggregator, Rotten Tomatoes gave the show a 100% rating based on 29 reviews with an average rating of 8.6/10. The critical consensus of the show read: Beautifully filmed and brilliantly acted, Wolf Hall masterfully brings Hilary Mantels award-winning novels to life.7. SS-GBThis drama series that airs on Zee Caf every Thursday is an alternate history drama thriller based on the 1978 novel of the same name by Len Deighton. Set in a 1941 alternative timeline when the Germans have won the Battle of Britain, detective Douglas Archer finds himself working under the brutal SS in occupied London. The script written by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade slot together the plots intricate jigsaw as factions within both the resistance and the occupiers enter the deadly endgame.8. CALL THE MIDWIFEOne of the most successful new drama series on BBC One since 2001, this show is an adaptation of the best-selling memoirs of Jennifer Worth about a group of nurse midwives working in the East End of London in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Call the Midwife has been loved by audiences in both the UK and the US and the series has won numerous awards and nominations since its original broadcast. The show has also been praised for raising awareness on a variety of topical, contemporary social, cultural and economic issues, including local community, miscarriage and stillbirths, abortion and unwanted pregnancies, birth defects, poverty, illness, disease epidemics, prostitution, incest, religion, faith, racism, prejudice, alcoholism, disability, (then-illegal) homosexuality, female genital mutilation maternal, paternal and romantic love.9. CRANFORDThis critically acclaimed multiple award-winning comedy drama TV series is based on three novellas - Cranford, My Lady Ludlow, and Mr Harrisons Confessions by Elizabeth Gaskell. It has been adapted brilliantly for TV by Heidi Thomas. Set in the early 1840s in the fictional village of Cranford in North West England, the story focuses primarily on the towns single and widowed middle-class female inhabitants who are comfortable with their traditional way of life and place great store on propriety and maintaining an appearance of gentility. Heidi Thomass script subtly brings out the power of the matriarchs, the centrality of gossip and  when the chips are down  the touching sense of community. It also manages to make the town itself the main character. The result, a much-loved show with memorable characters that capture the audiences imagination.10. SHERLOCKThe critically acclaimed series that has made Benedict Cumberbatch a household name is now a global hit. Based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyles Sherlock Holmes, the show depicts consulting detective, Sherlock Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch) solving various mysteries in modern-day London. Holmes is assisted by his flatmate and friend, Dr John Watson (Martin Freeman), who has returned from military service in Afghanistan. Although Metropolitan Police Service Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade (Rupert Graves) and others are at first suspicious of Holmes, over time his exceptional intellect and bold powers of observation persuade them of his value. Through Watsons blog documenting their adventures, Holmes becomes a reluctant celebrity with the press reporting on his cases and eccentric personal life.Follow @htshowbiz for more"

His model received an award at an FKCCI event recently. Venu says he plans to begin production of the cart in three months and has applied for a patent.Each cart would cost Rs 10,000 to Rs 12,000. An option of renting it would also be available at Rs 500 per week. He claims the cart can keep green leafy vegetables fresh for two to three days and most other vegetables for seven days. Tomatoes can be stored for up to two weeks. The cart is also easier to manoeuvre, with a better steering system in place.The model won the first prize of `1.5 lakh in a competition for business proposals conducted by FKCCI. The model won out of about 100 proposals and after going through five rounds.Speaking of how he came up with the concept, Venu said, I am from a rural background and migrated to Bengaluru when I was in Class 7. I saw many vegetable vendors here who struggled to manoeuvre their carts and were left with surplus goods which would go waste. I wanted to help them in some way.During his MTech course in processing and food engineering at IIHR, he discussed possible solutions for the problems with Dr G Senthil Kumaran, principal scientist at the institute and then came up with the concept. Venu says the cooling system can be used as a cheaper substitute for a refrigerator.Construction of deviceThe device reduces the temperature by 8-10 degree Celsius and increases humidity by 90 per cent. It consists of a metallic frame insulated by a 2-inch layer of charcoal.Two troughs are filled with water and attached at the top and bottom of the frame. A cloth is suspended between the troughs, and due to capillary action it carries water from the top trough to the bottom one. When water in the top trough gets over, itcan be refilled manually or with a motor."

A host of conditions have been stipulated pertaining to food, cleanliness at the kitchen, cooking, transportation, Manoj Rajan, Special Commissioner, BBMP, who is incharge of the Indira canteen project told DH.He said it has been stipulated that the caterer will have to abide by the provisions of the Food Safety and Food Standards Act, 2006. A third party audit will be conducted on a regular basis to monitor quality control and hygiene related issues, Rajan said.Precast technologyIn an innovative move, all Indira canteens are being constructed using 78 prefabricated elements. The government decided to choose precast technology over the conventional brick-and-mortar method as the former has the advantage of quality and speed of construction.It is estimated that precast technology helps in saving up to 64% of the time taken for projects using normal construction method. Each canteen will have eight tall round tables outside the premises and six benches inside. At any time, 80 people can partake food at the canteens, Rajan said.

This is Edgar Wrights Baby Driver, and its the best action movie since Mad Max: Fury Road, and also, in a fun twist, the best musical since La La Land.But you didnt expect that, did you?Ansel Elgort as Baby in a scene from Baby Driver. (AP)Ansel Elgort plays Baby, in a movie that delights in giving its characters names like Bats, Buddy, Darling, and Griff. Hes a getaway driver for a criminal kingpin named Doc, played by Kevin Spacey. Baby, described conveniently by Doc, had an accident when he was a kid, still has a hum in the drum, plays music to drown it out. In non-movie speak, that means Baby lost his parents in a car crash when he was a child, and developed acute tinnitus, which leaves a constant humming sound in his ears. He drowns out the noise (metaphor alert) with music, stored in a collection of vintage iPods, one for every mood.But like most movie getaway drivers, or career criminals, he wants out of the game. And when he meets Debora, a waitress at the local diner, played by Cinderella star Lily James, he decides to finally step on the gas, and hightail it across the border.Lily James, left, and Ansel Elgort in a scene from the film, Baby Driver. (AP)Ive never been to the opera, nor have I ever seen a 90-piece orchestra play Beethoven. But I imagine this  the action in this movie  is what it must feel like. Baby Driver is symphonic. Its ecstatic. Its hypnotic. When it soars, it soars. It glides off the road, shoots into the sky, and in a handful of melodic action sequences, it lives in the clouds, leaving others (and the Fast & Furious movies) biting the dust.But its not always like that. And thats irritating, as is usually the case with movies that come so close to greatness, but swerve away after a quick graze. Despite ending on a flamboyant note, Baby Driver spends almost two-thirds of its two-hour runtime either idling, or cruising in fourth gear. And during those first two acts, it barely resembles an Edgar Wright movie. It spends too much time in dark rooms lit by fluorescent lights, in grimy diners glowing with neon, and not, as it should have, on the road, with shades drawn over its eyes, and tunes blasting in its ears.Ansel Elgort, right, and Jamie Foxx in a scene from Baby Driver. (AP)The action, when it arrives  first in short bursts, and at the end, in a cascade  is like a burst of nitrous in its pipes.Often, you may have noticed movie trailers describing directors as visionary. I am here to tell you that it is all a lie. Like every other piece of advertising, immoral and sometimes downright criminal, those trailers are perpetuating falsehoods for profit, and stroking the egos of mediocre men.Edgar Wright however, is the real deal. Hes as visionary as they get  right up there with other cult favourites like Quentin Tarantino, Wes Anderson, David Fincher, Bong Joon-ho and Zack Snyder. There isnt a frame in this movies action scenes that doesnt seem as if it has been handcrafted by him. Everything, every moment, from those trademark Edgar Wright inserts and whip pans, precise to the millisecond, to the music video-style editing of the chase sequences, this is a staggering display of one mans vision, and the loyal dedication of hundreds of others to make it a reality.And hes a dying breed. While most major directors are happy, for various reasons  time, efficiency, indecisiveness, studio pressure  to use temporary tracks while editing their films, Wright is the rare contemporary filmmaker who cuts his movie to the music - like Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy), Tarantino, and Guy Ritchie (Snatch). The soundtrack, which includes an unusually high number of songs (30!), is, to paraphrase Tarantino, the soul of his baby.But heres the thing about Baby Driver: Yes, its the darling of the internet right now, having built incredible buzz since its first screening at the South by Southwest Festival. And yes, Edgar Wright has gone to Dwayne Johnson levels to promote it on social media, highlighting, as he should, the films incredible 100% Rotten Tomatoes score. But, its still an Edgar Wright movie  a weird, quirky, tonally hyperactive love-letter to cinema.Which means, its not for everyone.Like his previous films, the cult classic Cornetto Trilogy, and Scott Pilgrim vs The World (all excellent), it faces rather difficult terrain in its journey into the mainstream, but if this is how the rest of the world discovers his work, its not too shabby a place to start.Watch the Baby Driver trailer hereFollow @htshowbiz for moreThe author tweets @RohanNaahar"

The current prices of tomatoes have already soared to Rs 70-80 per kg in retail markets and would remain so for at least next two months.According to wholesalers, the prices have increased due to a heavy reduction in supply of tomatoes from neighbouring states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Haryana after the rain.Tomato prices shooting up is a normal occurrence during the monsoon months, from June to September. This is because the stock spoils easily during the rain. Right now, we are getting our supply only from Himachal Pradesh, said Rajendra Sharma, president of Azadpur Mandi.The shelf life of tomatoes is not more than four days. Not all retailers have an access to cold storage. So, they tend to recover the losses by selling at a higher price, Sharma said.According to wholesalers, the situation will remain the same until fresh stocks arrive in the markets by August-end.On Thursday, the wholesale prices of tomatoes at the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) market at Gazipur were between Rs 30 and 40.The soaring prices of vegetables have affected the sales of vendors in local markets.Till May-June, the retail price of tomatoes was Rs 40 per kg. As soon as the pre-monsoon showers hit the city, the prices climbed to Rs 60 per kg and finally soared to Rs 80 per kg by the end of the month. Due to a spike in prices, people do not buy more than half a kilogram of tomato at a time, said Abdullah, a vendor at Malviya Nagar vegetable market.Even coriander leaves and green chilies, which came complimentary with vegetables, are now being sold with a price tag of over Rs 10-15 for 100 grams. The increase in the vegetable prices has forced many to exclude these from their shopping list.Except for onions and potatoes, prices of all vegetables have increased by Rs 5-10 in the market. I used to buy vegetables for Rs 200 twice a week, but now the same quantity of vegetables cost anything between Rs 300 and Rs 350, said Aarti Malik, a resident of Geetanjali."

Vendors purchase a 25-kg tomato case for Rs 600 and sell native tomatoes at Rs 40 per kg. Tomatoes of higher quality are sold at Rs 50 a kg.However, retailers who buy the same case at Rs 600, sell tomatoes at Rs 65 a kg at Anna Nagar and Kilpauk. The price is high for the past two days. It was at Rs 24 a kg and now it has reached Rs 56. I have cut down on the quantity, says V Nagalakshmi.Supply is less. As tomatoes come from Andhra and Karnataka, the climate there also matters to cultivate crops. Excess rain or heat, both can damage the growth of tomato plants, says Ambedkar V, a vendor.Wholesale markets at Porur and Kilpauk were closed on Friday and those that were open wore a deserted look. With tomato prices on the high, the wholesale price of onion seemed decent. It was sold at Rs 13 a kg in wholesale and Rs 20 a kg in retail.Some retail shops at Anna Nagar sold onion at Rs 80 a kg.Onions and potatoes are being sold at Rs 20 a kg.

Thus, the farmers and consumers are assured of a fair price.When we sell quality tapioca at Rs. 23, how long will the other merchants charge higher, Mr. Biju asks.The shops do not garner massive profits, just enough to keep them going.Sixteen clusters of farmers under the seven villages in Kattappana block sell vegetables for local supply through the eco-shops of the samiti, he added.Krishi Bhavans train farmers to use organic fertilizers and pest control measures.The main produce are beans (Hosur and local varieties), cabbage, green chilli, bitter gourd, brinjal, cucumber, tomato, pumpkin, okra, tapioca, banana and yam.Value-added itemsCrops not locally produced, for example onion, are brought from Kanthallur or markets in Tamil Nadu. We will soon produce potato and beetroot for local supply, said Mr. Biju, himself a farmer.The shops also sell value-added items produced at the Vandanmedu cluster unit including dried jackfruit, dried onion, and banana powder.Middlemen outKrishi Bhavan assistant director A.T. Thomas said the aim of the eco-shops was to avoid middlemen.He said local shop owners often created problems as they could not charge prices on their own. We will overcome all hurdles, the official said."

Kitchens, including those in restaurants, will find the going tough if the agitation continues beyond the weekend.Not a single onion truck arrived in the Vashi market, indicating the strike's appeal in Nashik district which provides onions to the entire state and large parts of the country . While only eight to 10 items could reach the APMC against the regular 94 kitchen staples. Even the quantum of produce halved on Friday , compared to Thursday and Wednesday .Atotal of 43,827 quintals of fruits and vegetables arrived on Friday as against 70,246 quintals on Thursday and 78,272 quintals on Wednesday , shows data from the state's marketing department.Overnight, retail prices of vegetables and fruits doubled in certain localities, partly because wholesale rates rose and retailers chose to take advantage of the situation. Coriander was a stinging Rs 150-200 for a big bunch, prompting several vendors not to stock it.Andheri resident Shyam More said, ""There was no spike in vegetable prices which normally occurs between March to May . But this two-day strike has turned the situation upside down. The fear is milk supplies could be affected in the days to come, which will worsen our predicament."" The Andheri municipal market wore a forlorn look. Greengrocer Iqbal said, ""I sourced merely a few items like cauliflower, cabbage, spinach and green chillies for the day . I did not stock tomato or brinjal as wholesale prices were high and I would suffer losses if there are no customers."" By Friday evening, Iqbal sold cauliflower at his cost price of Rs 50, only to clear his stock.In Matunga, one of the most expensive markets in the city , seller Bhavesh Baarve chose to shut shop for a day . ""Vegetables in Vashi market were so expensive, I chose not to buy . I will assess the situation on Saturday ,"" he said.

The imminent onset of rains will destroy harvested produce as well as standing crops in the fields.""Approximately 250 truckloads of vegetables unloaded in Vashi on Sunday which is almost the same number as Saturday. Of these just 50 trucks were from Maharashtra , the rest from Gujarat, AP and MP. But few buyers arrived because of the uncertainty of the situation,"" said APMC trader Shankar Pingle.Pingle said other states were reaping the benefits of a local agitation. Deepak Sathe, owner of Byculla and Vashi's Sai Vegetables said, ""On Sunday, the wholesale rate of tomato was Rs 40-45, cauliflower and ladies' fingers Rs 45, capsicum Rs 50, green chillies and coriander Rs 60. I also deal with tomato farmers in Pune and Narayangaon who say they are barely finding buyers even for Rs 17-18 per kg. But see the exorbitant price Mumbaikars are being forced to pay.""Retail prices did fall marginally in certain areas like Dadar, Vikhroli and Bhandup but this was not enough to entice customers back to the market.Retailers opted to stay away from Vashi on Sunday for two reasons. Matunga vendor Rajabhau Patil said, ""We had vegetables left over from the previous day and we knew that few customers would step out to buy Sunday. Also there was the match between India and Pakistan. We cannot replenish our carts in such expensive times unless we are sure we will find buyers.""Several families tend to dine out or cook non-vegetarian fare on Sunday. This is another factor that prompts vendors to keep from adding stocks over the weekend. The trading community unanimously believes that the state should solve the impasse by inviting all farmers' groups for talks rather than pick and choose factions. Patil as well as Shankar Pingle, who was director in the NCP-affiliated APMC, echoed similar sentiments."

Sandeep Gidde (34), an MBA, is a Sangli farmer who also works as an event manager hosting agri-exhibitions. And 47-year old Dhananjay Dhorde has a Bachelor's degree and owns a 15-acre farm in Aurangabad.Younger, educated farmers like them form the backbone of Kisan Kranti, the group spearheading the strike which has crippled vegetable and milk supply chains across large parts of the state. The apolitical, leaderless agitation has drawn support from 37 smaller groups. But its core members are between 30 and 50 years old. Few have participated in previous agitations even though they come from farming families.""Our fathers did `rasta-rokos' and hunger strikes but it led nowhere. So we decided to do something different. If you don't pinch the nose, the mouth won't open,"" says Rayate. Significantly , the Opposition's `Sangharsh Yatra' just two months ago created barely a ripple.Besides small meetings, the use of social media including Whatsaspp and Facebook helped the movement reach out to other groups, guided by Gidde's event management skills. ""I knew how to reach out to large groups of people effectively and what posts could go viral,"" he says.What drew the Kisan Kranti together was the devastating crash in prices of key crops like onions, tomatoes and tur dal over the last year. The issue touched a chord among farmers across districts.The price crash had pushed even prosperous farmers like Rayate deeper into debt. ""Grapes which cost Rs 25 per kilo to grow, fetch a price of Rs 10. Last month brinjals were selling at Rs 25 for 20 kg. It cost more to transport them to the mandi,"" he said.The final catalyst was a gram sabha meeting in Ahmednagar's Puntamba village in April where villagers initially considered boycotting sowing. Later they decided to boycott agricultural markets instead. ""They realized its only when urban food markets are affected that there will be pressure on the government,"" says G Patil, an agro-markets expert who is part of Kisan Kranti.The movement spread to the onion belt of Nashik and the milk producing regions of western Maharashtra including Sangli, Satara and Solapur. Marathwada's districts, mainly Aurangabad, also joined.The discontent among farmers in the north Maharashtra belt had escalated with the state's decontrol of agricultural markets last year, says Patil. ""Traders called a strike for a monthand-a-half and onion prices crashed to 5 paise,"" says Patil. Later, the glut in the onion, tomato and tur crop kept prices low. Farmers ended up dumping their tomato and onion crop. By November, demonetisation added to the crisis.Activists recall a similar agitation led by farmer leader Sharad Joshi in 1982 but this one has created greater impact. ""The idea spread so fast because its time has come,"" says Patil. ""The new generation of farmers are more aware.They understand issues like import subsidies and the fact that crops are sometimes imported at a higher price than domestic rates.""Kisan Kranti has also drawn professionals including lawyers and social workers, whom they rely on for advice.""We have drawn up committees for different tasks: legal advice, meetings with the government, administration and publicity ,"" says Gidde."

In the city , truck arrivals at the APMC were close to normal and wholesale vegetable prices dipped from Sunday's high. However, retailers took advantage of the confusion over the status of the farmers' strike to keep them high.Vendors in Bhandup, Vikhroli, Bandra, Chembur and Andheri reportedly sold tomatoes at Rs 50-60 per kg. Lady finger and cauliflower remained high at Rs 80 while cabbage dropped to Rs 50-60. Cluster beans and french beans were still out of reach at Rs100-120 per kg.Potato and onion remained stable at Rs 16-18 per kg. In Andheri (W) alone, rates varied between Rs 50-120 per kg.

""I had planned an elaborate menu with salad since I had guests coming over the next day. But I was shocked to find peas selling at Rs 250 a kilo and turai at Rs 100! I could have easily bought 100 gm of cashew in that money,"" she exclaims.With the farmers of the state protesting the non-waiver of their loans (especially after crop failure), the agitation has led to a massive rise in the prices of vegetables and milk. Though the situation is improving, raising hopes of the rates returning to normal, the last few days have been nothing short of a nightmare for Mumbaikars. Radha Joshi, a chemistry lecturer, says, ""Not only have the prices skyrocketed, the vegetables also don't seem fresh. I understand the plight of the farmers, but this has definitely affected vendors and consumers. The government has to act fast.""The city is feeling the pinch in their pockets with the rates of regular vegetables like brinjal and cabbage doubling up. Matunga resident Astha Shrivatsav, a marketing manager, says, ""I paid Rs 70 for a kilo of cabbage, and Rs 64 for ivy gourd yesterday. I spent Rs 400 overall on veggies that would last me just three days."" Thane-based Minnat Mehrotra, an economist, explains, ""The rates of vegetables have been fluctuating in recent months. A few weeks ago, onions were selling at Rs 100 per kilo because of drought conditions in Andhra Pradesh. And now, the prices of all vegetables have gone up by at least 40 per cent because of the farmers' strike. There was no constant supply from the wholesale market and vendors had to rely on middlemen. I returned empty-handed from market over the weekend as I felt like I was buying gold, not vegetables.""Ever since the prices have risen, Dhivya Kumar, a second-year commerce student, is in an unusual dilemma. She says, ""I'm on a salad diet, but in the last three days, I haven't been able to afford lettuce or broccoli. The cabbages and carrots that I found in the Bandra market were almost rotten."" The month of Ramzan is on and Kurla-based homemaker Masooma Noorani rues, ""We alternate between veg and non-veg dishes to break the fast. We make bhajiyas out of brinjal, capsicum, potatoes, green chilies and even karela. But since vegetables are costing a bomb, we've been having chicken kebabs and other non-veg dishes regularly over the past few days.""Ever since e-commerce took the country by storm, people have been turning to shopping portals to order anything and everything  from clothes and electronics to cosmetics and vegetables. But if you are thinking you'd get veggies at nominal prices online now, here's some news  many online grocery stores have run out of vegetables. In fact, some portals have shut down the 'vegetable' category in their drop-down menu altogether! Vyasakh Mukundan, a civil engineer, rues, ""I checked several online stores for veggies like French beans, but they were out of stock. Tomatoes and bhindi were selling at Rs 20 less than what is available in the market. But when I ordered online, I got a message from the store a few hours later, saying they wouldn't be able to deliver it to me that day.""Among those who dig the well before they are thirsty is Deepali Chabra, an investment banker. She bought enough vegetables to last a week. ""I was worried that the supply to the markets would stop if the agitation intensifies. So, I bought a lot of vegetables and picked up several cartons of milk, too. However, I don't have enough storage space in my fridge,"" she says.Radha Venkatesh, a homemaker, did the same. But she follows certain steps to prolong the shelf life of the veggies. She says, ""I rely on my grandmother's trick to keep veggies fresher for longer. For instance, I store tomatoes in a bowl lined with newspaper. Ditto with palak and other green leafy vegetables. Wrap the leaves in paper, but consume them before four days. I blanch vegetables like brinjal, capsicum and cucumber in hot water and freeze them. Always remember to store onions in the dark corner of your kitchen. If you keep veggies away from heat source, like stove and fridge, they will last longer.""Bachelors like Vaibhav Chaudhury, intern with a marketing firm, plan to eat all three meals at restaurants. He adds, ""I think I'll save more money that way!""The hospitality sector is one industry that comes directly under fire with the soaring of vegetables prices. Though restaurants haven't cut corners till now, owners aren't sure for how long they'll be able to manage if the prices don't return to normal. Spokesperson of a soup and salad chain says, ""We've neither increased the price nor reduced the portion of our salads till now. But we will take necessary action if the situation doesn't get better."" Ganpat Godambe, manager of a South Indian restaurant in SoBo, adds, ""We still serve onions, tomatoes and cucumbers on every table as that's the norm. We don't want to compromise on the quality and quantity of vegetable curry and dishes, but we hope the prices come back to normal soon.""Mohammed Naeem, a vendor in Colaba market , says things are quite bad on the ground level. He says, ""We've been getting customers, but they are only buying basics. Earlier, veggies like brinjal or bottle gourd (dudhi) were sold at Rs 30 a kilo. But now, they are almost Rs 60-70. Iceberg lettuce is Rs 300 a kilo. Broccolis' regular rates of Rs 160 a kilo has shot up to Rs 300. Kothmir was Rs 20-30 a bundle, but now, it is Rs 100.""Not to forget, a bundle of mint leaves (pudina) now costs a whopping Rs 50. He adds, ""The rate of palak has tripled; it's now selling at Rs 30. Tomatoes are Rs 48 a kilo in wholesale market, but we sell it at Rs 60. That's because there's a wastage of at least 30 per cent when we transport them to our shop. We have no choice but to increase our price accordingly, as we need to earn, too."" Sadly, those who sell vegetables on carts have shut shop altogether. Vilas Shetye says he hasn't set shop at Cuffe Parade in the last two days. ""I couldn't afford to buy from the wholesale market. Others who sell veggies on carts inside complexes only have produce that is more than two days old. But we are hopeful that the situation will improve in the next two days,"" he says optimistically."

In several parts of the state, protesting farmers destroyed stocks of vegetables and milk headed towards cities and clashed with police as the chief minister ruled out a blanket loan waiver.Wholesale prices of certain produce increased by Rs 5-10 on Thursday as only 430 trucks arrived in the Navi Mumbai APMC, compared to the usual 500.""Retail prices did not increase on the first day of the strike. But if the stir continues,and agitationists stop farmers who bring their trucks to Mumbai along the highway, they will have to take a detour via smaller internal roads. Supplies may then shrink as many will not manage to take a long detour,"" said Raja Patil a vendor from Khar municipal market. ""While 30-40% vegetable supplies for Mumbai come from other states, prices of items coming from outside Maharashtra remained constant. Supplies of capsicum and tomato were less than the daily requirement which pushed their prices up. Friday will be decisive,"" said Balasaheb Badade, a trader.On Thursday, hundreds of agitating farmers in western and north Maharashtra and Marathwada region poured milk and dumped vegetables on roads to denounce government's inaction. Meanwhile, the agitation's co-ordinating body said the strike will intensify after chief minister Devendra Fadnavis rejected two of their main demands in a press conference in Mumbai. The CM ruled out a blanket loan waiver and said the state government will have to study whether implementation of the Swaminathan committee report will benefit the state. The Swaminathan committee report suggested support pricing for all agricultural produce in the state. ""A complete loan waiver is not possible for the state. If we had to give a loan waiver to all farmers in the state we would require Rs 1 lakh crore which is not even the revenue of the state per year,"" said Fadnavis. The state's annual revenue is between Rs 85,000-90,000 crore.""There are 31 lakh farmers across the state, who are outside the banking credit system and we are working on a scheme to make them creditworthy again. That itself works out to Rs 30,500 crore. We will have to look into their pending loans for which a committee has been formed,"" said Fadnavis.He slammed farmers who stopped trucks on Thursday and threw the produce on the roads. ""How can these people, who are holding other farmers to ransom, call themselves farmers? A strike has to be voluntary. You can't force anyone to be a part of your group,"" said Fadnavis. The CM said the government has called people leading the protest for talks. He also warned milk co-operatives who are not accepting milk from farmers. ""We will dissolve their board and appoint a government administrator, if these instances continue,"" he said.Finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said in Pune, ""The scenes of farmers resorting to strike are as heartbreaking as mothers shunning their duties towards children. It is definitely not a matter of pride for us that farmers are taking to the streets.""Several instances of stone pelting, burning and damaging of vehicles were reported across the state and police fired in the air to disperse agitators. Curfew was imposed in Yeola, Nashik, where a farmer and a policeman were injured in clashes. Most APMCs in Nashik, Solapur, Ahmednagar and Pune were shut though there was negligible support for the strike in Vidarbha."

Both the groups tried to drown out each other's voice. As Congress workers raised slogans demanding a wavier, BJP workers shouted out the party's achievements. It remained a peaceful affair, however.There was a clash-like situation for a brief moments as the police divided the two groups with a human chain. Congress workers threw tomatoes on the highway to mark their protest, BJP workers soon rushed to calling it Prime Minster Narendra Modi's swachata abhiyan (cleanliness drive). The cops intervened keeping both at a bay from each other.Congress workers have questioned the police's decision to grant permission to BJP workers when a rival party was already supposed to stage protests in the same area. ""This could have led to clashes as it has already happened in Ramtek during similar protests,"" the workers said. The party men also alleged that heavy police arrangement was made to protect the BJP workers.On the road from Nagpur to Fetri, BJP workers had put up posters praising the CM. A little ahead, Congress flags fluttered. The BJP camp was led by party's MLA from Hingna Sameer Meghe and district head Rajiv Poddar. On Congress' side, it was the party's head for Hingna constituency Kundatai Raut, who was later detained by the police. A few workers tonsured their heads as a protest.Fetri sarpanch Jyoti Raut issued a statement listing the steps taken after Fadnavis adopted the village. These include setting up water supply, internal roads, afforestation and electric sub-station.""A lot has happened after the chief minister adopted this village. As far as the farmers are concerned the state government has already declared a waiver package.

""Farmers could only manage to break even this season and don't have enough to repay their loans,"" said Pawar .""Our agitation is related to the farmers' crisis and the development work taken up by the chief minister is a different issue,"" said Deepak Raut, a Congress leader from nearby Godhni Railway.Urmila Dhavade from Fetri said her family owned a four acre farm and was left with a loan default of Rs50,000. Prabhakar Shastri, also from Fetri, said he had a 13 acre farm and a Rs1.5 lakh loan from Bank of India. Another farmer Sudhakar Shingare claimed to have defaulted on a Rs2 lakh loan.""Congress or BJP, once in power, nobody is bothered about the farmer's plight.

A few areawise disparities in the prices of some vegetables remained.Tomatoes and onions were being sold at an average price of Rs 15 to 20 per kg in most areas while cauliflower, brinjal and cabbage ranged between Rs 30 to Rs 60 per kg.Vegetable vendor Shankar Surve from Shivaji Market in Camp said retail prices of all vegetables were back to the normal level from June 8 as they were before the farmers' strike.""We also saw normal supply into the wholesale market on Thursday and Friday . Except for leafy vegetables, which always see an increase in price during the first couple of weeks in June, most vegetables like capsicum, brinjal and cabbage were being sold at Rs 30 per kg in Camp,"" he said.Leafy greens are usually up costwise during this time of the year due to inclement rainfall in some parts of the state, which destroys produce or an almost lack of rain resulting in less water supply for the vegetables, sources in the retail industry said.Most leafy vegetables, including fenugreek, spring onions and coriander, were priced at Rs 25 per bunch in the retail markets, currently .Vegetables that arrive in Pune's wholesale market come from the surrounding villages and from other states.For instance, a significant amount of okra comes from Gujarat, potatoes come from Indore. Within Maharashtra, a bulk of produce to the Pune market comes from Jalgaon, Solapur, Satara, Kolhapur, Karad and Bhigwan, among other regions.A vegetable vendor said prices in his area are just 10% above the normal due to less supplies in the wholesale market. ""The supply has reduced as farmers are currently involved in sowing for the kharif season. However, normal supplies may be expected in the next few days,"" he said.In most areas, vegetable prices have come down considerably in comparison to the initial days of the farmers' strike. Ranjeet Pawar, a vendor in Pimple Saudagar, said prices normalized a couple of days ago and most vegetables are below Rs 50 in his area.""Cauliflower was Rs 50 per kg two days back, but has now dipped to Rs 45. Chillies still cost Rs 68 per kg,"" Govind Singh, a vendor in Baner, said.Anand Mali, a chef, said, ""Vegetable prices in Mandai have dropped to the normal.However, retailers tend to charge erratically even now.Leafy vegetables, however, remain costly in comparison."""

It has also taken up with the Union government to increase procurement of sunflower seeds from 25% to 50% of the state's produce.The information was shared by Haryana agriculture minister Om Prakash Dhankar on Thursday while adding that the state government was implementing Swaminathan commission's recommendations in a step-wise manner by making agriculture risk free for farmers, with zero-interest loans and crop diversification.Replying to a question that Haryana farmers are forced to sell potatoes for even 20 paisa per kg, Dhankar said market forces cause drastic changes in the selling price of farmers' produce. On efforts to stabilise vegetable prices, Dhankar informed, ""There are plans to levy more taxes when prices improve, and use the funds collected for farmers' welfare when the prices drop.""The minister said that the state government has already requested the Centre to procure 50% to states' sunflower seeds produce at the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 3,950 per quintal.To a question on farm debt waiver, Dhankar replied that the state government's main focus is to make farmers self-sufficient instead. He said that a target has been fixed to increase farmers' income to Rs 1 lakh per acre. But he also said that farmers across the world require assistance in the form of subsidies as the agricultural sector does not yield earnings as high as that of the service sector. ""Therefore, the state government offered subsidies to the tune of Rs 11,000 crore per year,"" he said.He informed that during his tour to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji, the delegation studied techniques adopted for horticulture, floriculture, dairying, animal husbandry, storage and transportation of wheat, which would be replicated in Haryana.Taking a dig at the protesting Congress leaders in the state, Dhankar said that the Swaminathan commission's report was submitted to the government in 2006 but the previous Congress government failed to implement its recommendations. ""In fact, the then CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda had formed a committee which further delayed the implementation of the recommendations,"" he said.The minister told that against the commission's recommendation of compensation of Rs 10,000 per acre to farmers, the Congress government paid them only Rs 6,000 per acre whereas the BJP government gave compensation to the tune of Rs 12,000 per acre to farmers."

5a04a53c9855b76bf13be519,As you sow…,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Masquerader/as-you-sow/,2017-06-11,,The Times Of India,"The inventory begins-in agriculture, as in life! Peeling-off the political peels, there lies a core to the matter, which serially has the following aspects.Is farming the riskiest profession in this country, leading to so many suicides? Is a farmers income stability the same or even comparable to that of the wholesaler, retailer or consumer? Why does he have to take a heap of loans, and still continue to top-up? Why does the hand that tills the soil still considered synonymous with poverty? Are MSPs (minimal support prices) calculated on say, 25% above the costs, as retail elsewhere is protected by MRPs? All politicians being farmers (80% truly, the remaining by possession of land), enjoy tax exemptions, and earn their salaries, seem to have the cake and take it too! Can they help filling the loan kitty by paying taxes on their huge farm incomes?Finally, like so many professions, why does the farmer prefer his sons to settle in jobs in cities to plough-in the same profession?Some answers are obvious. Others may be linked to the frailty of human nature. The glaring blunder that one sees is that quite like the Imperial policy. Independent India found it easier to continue to enforce a camouflaged negative input policy (lagaan) on the farmer (In WTO parlance, it was once remarked that Indian agriculture was working on a negative subsidy). After consuming his voting powers, he was to be kept ignorant and disconnected so as not to be able to negotiate his grains in his market-linked product.Misinformation was to make him kneel down before his self -chosen ministers and beg for financial assistance so that he could he could replace himself as the second bull to till the soil once again.He was unaware of one crucial rightthat since he was the owner of the product, he had a right to negotiate for prices with his government, and that would also include international markets. I am not ruling out the democratic process of negotiations. No system was worked out. Our tanned sinewy brothers began to be seen hanging from trees, or slain by pesticides bought from loans, which was actually their own money, perpetually and systematically picked from his pockets. Cant blame anyone in particular, for we have had two farmer Prime Ministers (Ch. Charan Singh, Shri Dewe Gowda). I may vindicate the premise further. Why is loan waiver to the farmer a winning proposition for any political party, and has been tried by every political party!The book of politics is the same. Only editions vary.I had the honour of treating Indias first agronomist, Shri Sharad Joshi, the founder of the Shetkaari Sangathana in Vidarbha.Being a Rajya Sabha member, and for a while a WTO negotiator at that time, he would drop in casually, and often invite me to dinner at the India International Centre.On a particular day, he asked me how much a movie ticket cost twenty years ago. It was reasonable to guess, Rs. 20-25.At the time of the conversation, a PVR ticket was around Rs 500. Regarding onion, and tomato prices, I agreed they must have been around 10-15 then, and 15-25 now.He brought out his point that though the cinema gained 200 times in value (market links not denied), the man who grew the potato, at the most doubled his cost. This yawning gap was not sustainable once the markets get linked (invariably), nationally and internationally. This was the crux he told me.On the other hand, he added, it was not feasible that rice and pulses be sold at Rs. 100-200/kg.and in between lay the unpredictable and meandering river of politics! Sure enough, two months later, Mr Joshi dropped in for a chat, and told me that a politician had relieved him of his WTO duties. Neither he nor I was surprised. I had also begun to realize that even in medicine, mediocrity fetches the bulk.In Darwins quote, survival of the fittest, the word fittest perhaps denotes adaptability of a fox more than it denotes the strength of the lion, or the structure of the dinosaur.A wise government would like to take an opportunity in reforming the system.In its basics, the matter is of production of that which feeds the nation, as well contributes the largest chunk to the national economy, and the prices it should fetch in the market, so that the production is lucrative enough for people to invest and put efforts in this production.The answer lies in all the nitty-gritty that farming is about. Not to deny that government units may be working on it, the seed production units at much less subsidies, can increase yields many folds, for a component that grows naturally.Before one talks of outcomes, investments have to be made in infrastructure. Irrigation schemes, river linking have to pick up priority, much like that for industrial growth.I believe much information is being provided on fertilizers and indigenous soil additives as compost. They need to be capitalized on. I believe with better electricity farmers co-operative mini compost plants would be seen more frequently on the landscape.There is a case of hybrid seeds for certain crops, where there is enough evidence that there are no long- term effects on health. The damage done by pesticides should not be forgotten.Loaning to farmers at lesser rates has a limitation, and as other benefits as MNREGA, should be specific and should have checks that money is transferred, and that it is utilized for an agreed purpose.Finally, what the farmer requires are good fund managers. Money earned during a bumper crop is likely to flow to liquor barrels. It may be sagaciously invested for a rainy day or a non-rainy year.Advance advice on crop suitability worked on basis of demand or congestion of forward delivery chains nationally, and internationally is extremely crucial. Such knowledge is on the back of the palms of the commodity market players, as well as the government. Such information should be part of the fund manager and advisory units that should have every farmer enrolled in his area, and advice be given in one to one encounters. It is heartening to see a few apps by some Bangalore-based companies provide all such information to the farmers.Lastly, comes the question of the government allowing private participation in certain sectors in farming, exports, to make the outcomes comparable, publishable, replicable, and without intending much-reliable!Just heard the Chief Minister broke his fast on the second day. No further changes in the compost policy have been announced!Blog-breaking news! Maharashtra has just announced a loan waiver! Brave! Bharat and India are learning not to cheat on each other!Main chhahta bhi yahi tha, wo bewafa nikley,Usey samajhney ka koi to silsila nikaley(Maybe I wanted her to expose her disloyalty,Perhaps that was the only way to understand the affair)"

While the cost of green chillies have risen to Rs 70 per kg, the price of tomatoes have gone up to Rs 60 per kg. Traders are of the view that prices will increase in the coming days. Vendors at Ernakulam market said before Eid the retail price of green chillies and tomatoes per kg were Rs 60 and Rs 40 respectively. They say sourcing of vegetables from neighbouring states, particularly Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh have become difficult and has resulted in increased prices.""We procure green chillies mainly from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The produce from these regions is sufficient enough to meet local demand.Hence, we have a tough time making procurement,"" said KK Asharaf, vice-chairman, Ernakulam market (vegetable) stall owners association.He also said as production of tomatoes have reduced in North Indian states traders from those regions have started procuring tomatoes from places like Hossur and Bangalore in Karnataka. ""Their trucks have started queuing up at places, where traders from Kochi also buy the produce. The increased demand has resulted in surging prices,"" added Asharaf.Stall owners said the price of carrots and beans have gone up as well. While carrots costs Rs 70 per kg, beans costs Rs 60 per kg. Last week the prices of carrots and beans per kg were Rs 60 and Rs 50, respectively.PV Joy a stall owner at Ernakulam market said that the cost of shallots, onions and coriander have not been affected.""Initially, we thought the price hike was due to Eid festivities.Later we concluded that the real reason was heavy rainfall,"" he said. Shallots costs Rs120 per kg and coriander costs Rs 160 per kg. ""Onions, which cost only Rs 20 has become the most affordable vegetable,"" said Joy .However, locally produced vegetables like bitter gourd, snake gourd, elephant foot yam are available in the market.While bitter gourd and snake gourd costs Rs 40 per kg, elephant foot yam can be bought at a price of Rs 47 per kg. These vegetables are mainly procured from Kottayam, Thrissur and Idukki districts.Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) said price of vegetables surge in the city when arrival from other states decrease. ""Kerala does not produces enough and we are dependent on other states. This is one of the main reason for the hike,"" said an official."

The department conducted a training session-cum-exhibition on Saturday, which was attended by as many as 500 vegetable and fruit farmers from Thondamuthur block. The event familiarised the farmers with drip irrigation systems, use of hybrid seeds, modern farming techniques like shade net and pro-tray, all of which consume less water and produce a good yield.Thondamuthur, one of the main vegetable cultivation belts in the district, has around 70% of cultivable lands covered by drip irrigation. But hardly 50% of them are in working condition, said horticulture department officials. ""We want to achieve 100% coverage in the block, which will be beneficial for the farmers,"" said deputy director A Ramakrishnan. ""On an average, a farmer uses about 25 litres of water a day to irrigate a coconut tree. However, most of that water goes to waste. It is also a massive waste of money. By installing a drip irrigation system, they can save at least 25% of the irrigation water,"" he said.""The State government has allotted Rs 22.02 crore for installation of drip irrigation systems across 3,665 hectares in the district,"" said Ramakrishnan. ""If the fund does get over, we can get funds from other districts,"" he said.The farmers were also told to cultivate a mix of vegetables. ""If you have four to six acres of land, do not cultivate tomato across the land, as you can not manage its water requirement. Instead, you should cultivate tomato, eggplant and lady's fingers, so that even if the price of one vegetable drops, you can earn an income by selling the others,"" said Ramakrishnan.Professors from the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) educated the farmers on the use of shade net, use of polyhouse, biofertilisers, vermicompost and use of hybrid seeds. ""Hybrid seeds are better cultivated in pro-trays because there will not be competition among the seedlings for water and nutrition. They will all grow to the same length within 25 days and can be transferred to the field,"" said PR Kamala Kumaran from TNAU . ""But, hybrid seeds are expensive and can not afford to be wasted,"" he said.Many farmers expressed apprehensions about installing drip irrigation systems and using hybrid seeds. ""I did not install drip irrigation because the farmland in Chadivayal is close to the forests and wild elephants might destroy it,"" said C Kannaiya , a farmer."

""But currently there is no plan to upgrade the list or include vegetables in this list,"" Singh said.When told that farmers in Gujarat were throwing their produce away because of low support prices, Singh said that they should use cold storage facilities.Speaking at the seminar on 'Productivity and Product Diversification Challenges for Natural Fibres,' Singh said that natural fibres are the backbone of Indian textile industry. He said that despite stiff competition from synthetic fibres, the demand for natural fibres was steadily increasing with a growing population.The minister further said that given the limitation in increasing area under cultivation, the only way to improve production is increasing productivity. He said that introduction of high-yielding varieties, best agronomical practices, efficient fibre extractors and effective utilization for diversified products will improve productivity. Cotton is produced in over 90 countries across the world, and over 60% of that production comes from India, Singh said.Union textile minister Smriti Irani said the textile ministry and agriculture ministry have decided that the two ministries will have a regular exchange of information, knowledge and feedback on best practices .

These exotic vegetables were collected and are grown by Prabhakar Rao , who is a farmer by passion, but was working as an architect in Dubai until he retired and returned to India in 2011. Once he was back, he opened his farm in Bengaluru and started testing out the seeds to see which of the 560 heirloom seeds he had would be suitable to be grown in the city.""The nature of my work allowed me to travel to almost all parts of the world. Whenever I travelled, I would meet previous generation farmers and ask them if they have any variety of seeds that they used to grow and don't do so anymore. Some of them were gracious and would share a seed or two,"" says Prabhakar.His son, Varun , sees it as a potential agricultural startup business and has plans to expand and get more people to grow these seeds. But Prabhakar collects the seeds out of passion and to ensure that they are not extinct. The father-son duo are currently working on rare varieties of onions and carrots.When we asked if these plants are healthy or genetically modified, Varun, who was an engineer in the US, says that their farming methods are natural farming, which is even better than organic farming. ""We use bio fertilizers  which is made from the cow urine and cow dung of desi cows  as manure. This is sprayed on the soil which, in turn, adds a lot of microbe to the soil, helping the plant absorb the nutrients. With this method, one cow can fertilize up to 12 acres, which makes the cost of natural farming significantly lower than that of organic farming. It is a win-win situation for farmers and consumers,"" says Varun.It is interesting to note that these exotic plants take just a few days longer to grow than the others, and can be grown in your backyard. What's more? You do not have to go back to buy the seeds, since once you grow them, you can cultivate the seeds from the plant itself."

Legend has it that the craft was patronized by Tipu Sultan during times of drought to help the people of Channapatna earn a living. He brought a family of artisans from Persia to make wooden columns and later wooden toys to ornate the columns.Later, when the famous Mysore doll industry started dwindling, all the dolls for Dasara were made in Channapatna, and that's how the tradition lived. The craft flourished and hit its peak in the 70s and 80s when wooden napkin rings were exported in huge numbers.""This was Channapatna's golden period. But soon demand for flat toned finish picked up, affecting the traditional lacquering of tonal gradation. This continued for a good 10 to 12 years. Then buyers found cheaper places such as China and other Asian nations for these products,"" says Atul Johri.""Although a few groups and individuals continued to make the traditional wooden wares but the craft started losing its sheen as the tonal gradation techniques were lost owing to mass production in order to compete with the Chinese replicas, and lack of skilled artisans. This also led to people leaving Channapatna for odd jobs in Bengaluru,"" he adds.""The replicas first land in Mysuru and then come to Channapatna, and sold along with the toys made here. The government has barely done anything to check this influx.The replicas were so cheap that the units and artisans in Channapatna couldn't sustain the competition and many started selling the cheap foreign imita tions, which was more profitable,"" says Ali Khan, a fourth genera tion craftsman.The government con ducts training workshops but they haven't been of much help to the artisans in Chan napatna.With no focus on the market dynamics for domestic and global consumption, these trainings are of little benefit.

While retailers do not link the increase with GST, they feel an apprehension of overall increase in prices in the new tax regime has prompted middlemen to jack up prices. They have also cited less buying by retailers during rainy season as another reason for supply shortage in local markets.In retail markets , increase in average prices is ranging between Rs 10 and Rs 15 per kg. So far, the worst hit has been tomato which has seen a decline in supply and a sharp rise in prices. During the past fortnight, tomato price has increased by around Rs 15 per kg. ""We sold tomato at Rs 40-45 per kg even two weeks back. Now it is being sold at Rs 60 per kg. We are told that there has been a dip in supply of the Bengaluru crop,"" said Gopal Kundu, a vegetable retailer at Lake Market. Tomato prices have actually shown a sharp rise across the country in the past 10 days following crop damage due to rain in tomato-producing states like Haryana.""We receive the bulk of tomato from Maharashtra. But supplies have gone down substantially in the past few weeks. This has created a supply shortage in the wholesale market. As a result, prices of tomato has almost doubled in the past week,"" said Uttam Mukherjee, chief supervisor of Koley market.Other vegetables, including striped gourd (parwal), ladies finger (bhindi), brinjal and onion, have also recorded increase in prices at city markets. ""At Maniktala market, prices of vegetables like striped gourd, ladies finger and brinjal have increased by around Rs 10 per kg in past two weeks. So far, there has not been any report of crop damage from rain in neighbouring districts. But, price is still rising,"" said Kartik Saha, a vegetable vendor at Maniktala market.""Government has said there won't be any impact of GST on vegetables.

Then, the traders depend on Madanapalli giant tomato market in Chittoor district. Similarly, local traders depend on Guntur, Krishna and Berhampur in Odisha for green chillies in the current season.

Excess rainfall crippled tomato production in Madanapalli,"" said G Prasad, estate officer of the Kancharapalem Rythu Bazaar Meanwhile, the IMD officials said south coastal districts have been receiving excess rainfall due to monsoon being active in the region and formation of a trough off the south Tamil Nadu coast.According to Prasad, the city needs nearly 80 tonnes of tomatoes daily. Nearly 50 per cent of the city's total requirement is contributed by 13 Rythu Bazaars in the city.""All traders, including those at Rythu Bazaars, depend on Madanapalle for tomatoes and Guntur and Berhampur districts for green chillies.

I happened to see a svelte girl in a dress and stilettos, screwing up her eyes and scrutinising a set of stone-studded bangles, while simultaneously sending the snapshots of the accessories to someone.Presuming her to be a potential customer, the proprietor was busy plying her with choices of pretty accessories. Observing her, I had guessed within seconds that she was just window-shopping as she waited for someone. Just as I had inferred, the moment she saw some guy signalling at her, she hopped out of the shop in long strides without spending a single penny, after squandering the time of the storekeeper!Indeed, window shopping is an art in itself. Perhaps, all it needs is the knack of plunging into minds imponderable depths for those specific things not in the shop, and persistently ask for it till the shopkeeper is full of remorse for not providing you with those items as you leave the shop displaying pseudo displeasure, and importantly, without having pulled your purse-strings! These techniques I had twigged by watching a friend, a terrific window shopper.Recently, this friend was all set to stride into a shop selling full-length skirts. You already have dozens of it. Cant we skirt the idea of buying skirts? I quipped. Her usual refrain was Dekhne meinkyaharzihain yaar? Then rushing inside, she launched on her usual modus operandi of window shopping, as the salesgirl displayed several varieties.Well, this skirt is too garish, flamboyantly coloured Graphic prints too bold in this Geometric patterns, not impressive Dont you think this is over neoteric and outlandish to look? Floral designs, not really captivating The pastel hues, a whitstaid Actually, I am looking for some raven-black and red combo. No, not that cherry-red or blood-red It is tomato-red Needless to say, we walked out later without buying anything!Yet another time, on a scalding noon, coercing me to come along she charged inside a cool jewellery showroom. Sipping into freebie cold beverages, she set off on her strategy. This piece is tad traditional, looks like we have just tumbled out of caves This is too nouveau pattern, spoiling that aesthetic look. Now, dont try diddling us with some inferior stuff. Do I look so credulous? While the salesgirl, sweat trickling down her temples, was tenaciously presenting tantalising designs, my friend was stubbornly shaking her head at every single piece.Later outside, she said cheerily, Imagine all these free mauj, masti, mazaa! Then, she revealed something that stumped me beyond words. Know what I do these days? In snazzy showrooms, I pick up couple of sensuous looking dresses, which surely I wouldnt be buying, then sport them in trial rooms, take selfies and send them across on FB and garner zillions of likes! Indeed, an irredeemable window shopper, I sighed."

Since both my parents were teachers and would often be busy with work, I would cook basic dishes like khichdi and burji for myself. My love for food turned into my passion when I moved to Delhi for my higher studies. I had to cook for myself and that is when I started to explore. I was exposed to a lot of fresh ingredients and spices as I stayed very close to Azadpur Mandi, which was one of the largest vegetable markets.I decided to pursue a career in food and in 2003, I joined the Institute of Hotel Management, Bhubaneswar. It was a completely new experience for me. A new city, new cuisine and dishes like ghugni (snack), dalma (rice), and chhena poda (sweet) were all completely different from what I was used to in Delhi.I was 18 when I entered the industry and I worked with The Oberoi, Kolkata.There again I came across a completely new and different burst of flavours and dishes like rasgullas, sandesh (sweet), jalebis, kala jamun and much more. From Kolkata, I went straight to Kerala, in 2010 for a year, where I fell in love spices like the black pepper, cinnamon, mace, etc. We got fresh fish right out of the water. We were also part of an Ayurveda camp, wherein we had to cook food according to the prescriptions given by doctors for guests who were on medication. I also learnt to make sadhya, (means a feast), karimeen polichathu and Kerala sambar.In 2011, I went to the US and worked at the Steakhouse. There I learnt the fine tuning of steaks with expensive meat products. I also got the opportunity to work for the Carnival Cruise Lines. I travelled to different parts of Mexico, South America and Europe, where I got my hands on the best tomatoes, wines and cheese. I have been with Marriot Chennai since May 2017.I am so glad to have got such wonderful opportunities to travel to different places and explore so much of food, because it has really helped me grow as a chef. I have noticed that Chennai has a mixed set of cuisines, like Udipi, Chettinad, Andhra and so on.I am yet to master South Indian cuisine, but I am quite confident about the North Indian cuisine. Butter chicken, mutton rogan josh, chole, rajma chawal and karimeen pollichathu are some of my best dishes.Meen PollichathuIngredientsCleaned fish steaks/filet: 20 pieces, 1 kg (measured after cleaning)Turmeric powder: 10 gmPepper powder: 20 gmSmall onion: 200 gmCrushed ginger: 50 gmCrushed garlic: 50 gmGreen chilli: 20 gmChilli powder: 50 gmCoriander powder:50 gmTomato: 200 gmCoconut milk powder: 20 gmSalt: 20 gmCurry leaves: 5 gmCoconut oil: 30 mlBanana leaf: 1 bigMethodMake gashes on both sides of the cleaned fish.

5a0525789855b76bf13bfe06,"Food, thy name is...",http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2017/jul/01/food-thy-name-is-1622712.html,2017-07-01,,The New Indian Express,"HYDERABAD: When you are in the Philippines, you get an opportunity to indulge in island hopping, which is as fun-filled as party hopping! You get to explore different places, meet interesting people, and taste different cuisines (if you are willing to do some bold experiments!). Otherwise, if you are like me, come back enlightened about some attention-grabbing food habits.Palawan, a narrow archipelago of 1,780 islands on the western border of the Philippines is bound by the South China Sea on the west and the Sulu Sea on the east, stretching 650 km from tip to tip. Synonymous with spectacular dives, magnificent seascapes and popular activities like snorkelling, kayaking etc., its sanctuaries, hidden lagoons, soaring limestone cliffs and pristine beaches are irresistible to any traveller. The capital city, Puerto Princesa is approximately one-hour air travel from Manila and that was where we landed.Allen, our guide, while briefing us on Palawan Island, said it is mostly inhabited by two tribes: Batak who live up in the mountains and practice slash and burn cultivation and the more civilised Tagbanwa who live in the lowlands. Concluding that their food habits also reflect their ethnic roots, my innocent question on the subject elicited an elaborate discourse from Allen, on the Filipino food culture.Rice is a staple in every meal and one without rice is not considered a full meal. It is only counted as merienda (snack) no matter how large the helping. A day isnt complete without three full, warm meals and snacks in between. It is not unusual to eat five times a day: breakfast, mid-morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack and dinner. Some may even fit in a sixth snack after dinner and before turning in for the night. Asking if the person has eaten or inviting people to eat is a common greeting in the Philippines. It is never polite to refuse food in the Filipino setting - even if you are already very full. A nibble or a bite is enough to show appreciation. Filipinos would rather starve than not prepare a small merienda for a guest - Isnt that typical of Asian hospitality?He went on to elaborate on the unique Filipino food culture and its own idiosyncrasies. Snake meat, he said, is indeed delicious when grilled or roasted and tastes like chicken. Crickets are much-coveted treats when heads, legs, and wings are removed and fried to crispiness on the outside, and soft texture on the inside. The clean farm rats and frogs living in the wilderness too taste like poultry! Tamilok, a mollusc found in the rotting mangroves, tastes like oyster and is a famous delicacy in Palawan.Buwaya, the crocodiles succulent white meat has a distinctive flavour and aroma. It is low in fat, low in calories and high in protein, good for the heart and lungs and is a natural aphrodisiac. What more, its easy to cook, chewy, texture like chicken etc. How about the Abuos, fried ant eggs and larvae? The giant ants/termites eggs and larvae are harvested from trees like the tamarind tree and are relished by all. They are a good source of protein and will lower blood pressure.Besides, some of them thrive on the meat of monitor lizard called bahawa while some relish the flesh of the monkey. As I listened to him, I was reminded of an idiom-One mans meat is another mans poison. Well, their food is their sustenance, their medicine. They look at these animals from a different angle.But the pice de rsistance came that evening at Baywalk Park, one of the most visited tourist attractions in Puerto Princesa City. Apart from its relaxing ambience, the Baywalk Park also houses a number of restaurants, which offers seafood and aphrodisiacs including crocodiles and frogs (Filipino street food is exotic and at times shocking!). There were many carts selling various foods like boiled corn, grilled meat etc. Women were selling boiled duck eggs on a bed of peanuts. Allen announced that he was going to demonstrate how they eat Balut, a popular snack. Balut is a 14 to 18 days old duck embryo, boiled and served with rock salt or spicy vinegar: the contents are eaten directly from the shell, the partially developed embryo bones being soft enough to chew and swallow as a whole.Allen ate it dramatically as we all clicked pictures. Later he explained that it is a powerful aphrodisiac and is very popular with Filipino men. During my brief stay on the bay walk, I saw only women selling it (on push carts) and men consuming. I didnt see any woman eating it. Maybe Filipino women dont need aphrodisiacs!!Then the next day we went for lunch at Badjao Seafront; a floating restaurant built in a mangrove area offering picturesque views of Puerto Princesas seascape and a surreal experience. Walking through the narrow wooden bridge leading to the restaurant, I felt the beauty of every step. The rustic al fresco Badjao rests on stilts and gives a great feeling of being in the midst of mangroves. After hearing Allens stories and seeing him in action, I played it safe and opted for ensaladang talong; a mixture of grilled eggplants, tomatoes and onions tossed in a vinegar dressing. For dessert, I had fresh slices of pineapple and watermelon. Sometimes we eat only to survive. Dont we?(The author is a documentary filmmaker and travel writer; she blogs at vijayaprataptravelandbeyond.com)"

But to begin on a tangent  radical wisdom was that everything is political. We used to say everything has a class character. I gradually learned otherwise. Truth does not have a class character; nor do love, laughter, grief and conscience. If they are rendered political they cease being what they are; and we would already be in an Orwellian universe. Air and water and grass are neither Hindu nor Muslim, neither proletarian nor bourgeois. But yes, extremist ideologies are fast becoming the opiate of choice for desperate people. If the centre cannot hold, it is because truth is fragile and of no use to anyone except in distorted bits and pieces. We refuse to stand on our own two feet. What sense may we make of this situation?Bright future etc.The Russian existentialist Nicolai Berdayev (exiled in 1922) said of Communism that what is most terrible in it is the mixture of truth and falsehood. We might rephrase this as the interplay of sociology and utopia. But this is a feature of ideology as such, not just its Communist version. Ideologies combine carefully selected verifiable elements with dreams and promises. Their sociological features pertain to real socio-economic problems and conflicts. The utopian feature assures us of a dream-like solution to those problems; a promise made by a vanguard which will lead us to the glorious new dawn.There is a further dimension, the impulse towards geopolitical reality. Historically this was expressed in projects such as the Crusades, Dar-ul-Islam, Lebensraum, or even the American Century now drawing to a close. The New Medina, Khalistan and Hindu Rashtra fall in the same category, as does ISIS, the latest manifestation of Islamic utopia.A century ago, the Bolshevik regime declared itself an armed camp of the world proletariat. The Peoples Republic of China in its earlier phase saw itself as the red base for world revolution. In each of these cases we see a fragment of world spirit aspiring to unity, a part of humanity declaring itself the whole. These are dreams wherein the dreamer believes himself to be awake in contrast to ordinary mortals who are asleep. And in each the impulse to violent assertion is paramount, because only via murderous passion can such movements gain momentum.Eternal drum-beatMilitarism is the secret of eternal warfare, to which capitalism has accommodated itself. Theres money to be made in conflict, ask any arms dealer, or foreign ministry. This is the ground shared by enemies, upon which every victory is a defeat for humanity. But what if there is inertia to violent conflict, fuelled by psychological, ideological and economic factors? As in the impulse to revenge, doctrinal cussedness, combined with material benefit to some major decision-makers? What if peace process is a chimera?Militarism has a long tradition in India, evidenced most clearly in the activities of revolutionary terrorist groups such as Anusilan and Jugantar. Communal ideologies too, were obsessed with civil war. In November 1947 an AICC resolution warned that the activities of the Muslim National Guards, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the Akali Volunteers and such other organizations represent an endeavour to bring into being private armies, (and) must be regarded as a menace to the hard-won freedom of the country.The proliferation of private armies after 1947 has proven the foresight of this warning. These formations include the Sunlight Sena, Khalistani groups, the Ranvir Sena, the Bajrang Dal, ULFA and jehadi groups in Kashmir and elsewhere. All paramilitaries enjoy some degree of protection by legal parties. In the early 1980s Prime Minister Indira Gandhi saw fit to encourage extremist activists in Punjab (Bhindranwale) as did her successor in Sri Lanka (the LTTE).The carnage that followed her assassination in November 1984 opened the floodgates of state-sponsored hooliganism and the blatant subversion of justice. In Chhattisgarh, the BJP and Congress jointly supported the vigilante Salwa Judum to terrorise those who dared resist the takeover of mineral-rich lands by corporates. Despite a Supreme Court order in 2011 disbanding it, this state-supported vigilante force continues under a different name. Such is the respect for law shown by our political leaders.The paramilitary RSS has forged a far more sophisticated method of overthrowing the Indian Constitution than the Maoists. This method is based on V. D. Savarkars directive of 1942, asking Hindutva cadre to infiltrate the organs of state. But it relies more upon ideological conviction than organizational affiliation. During the Babri Masjid demolition campaign, a retired DGP joined the VHP and called for Indias Muslims to be stripped of voting rights. This campaign cost the lives of some 1500 citizens in 1990 and 3000 in 1992. In the year 2000 a retired CBI Director extolled the Bajrang Dals activities at its annual function.The Modi regime has afforded impunity to vigilantism in the garb of love jihad, Bharat Mata and cow protection. Criminal cases related to terror attacks have been soft-pedalled where they involve RSS cadre. Interference with criminal justice has been attested to by the prosecutor Rohini Salian; and includes the Malegaon and Samjhauta train cases. The Hindutva lobby has used official clout to unleash captive mobs, hate-speech, push RSS cadre into state institutions and suborn security forces. The latter practice was noted by the Union Home Ministry in its February 1948 order banning the RSS after Mahatma Gandhis assassination.Elephant in the drawing roomIt is time for the establishment to shift its gaze briefly from the stock-market and ask itself what it objects to in Naxalite activity. Is it lawlessness and contempt for the Constitution? But does Naxalism hold a monopoly on lawlessness? Every mainstream party carries a burden in this regard. Not just the Congress and BJP/RSS, powerful state parties too are culpable. The CPI (M) dispatched a vigilante force to Nandigram on two occasions in 2007. Killer gangs of the CPI (M) and the RSS operate in Kerala. Isnt there a problem when people in authority misuse formal power to promote violence? The appearance on April 10, 2016 of Gujarat ex-DIG Vanzara, accused of engineering a fake encounter, on a podium with RSS leader Mohan Bhagwat signals something sinister  the relentless effort by the RSS to abolish the distinction between legal and illegal violence.Those who want Maoist violence to stop must tell us what happens to their conscience in the face of the RSSs contempt for the rule of law. The Sangh defends itself by flaunting its patriotism. But Naxalites are nationalists too  they see themselves as political inheritors of Bhagat Singh. When the Home Minister denounces the Sukma incident as cold-blooded murder, he needs to be reminded that that his political allies have been murdering people on some pretext or other on a regular basis.Was not the murder of Pehlu Khan cold-blooded? Did not the NHRC indict the Chhatisgarh police in January for sexual violence against Adivasis? Did not RSS affiliates attack a police station in UP on April 23 and beat up policemen, even entering the residence of an IPS officer on one occasion? Does anyone believe that the law will take its own course in these matters? We are on the verge of becoming an entirely lawless state, and who, pray, is responsible for this?Undoubtedly there are police officers, magistrates and judges committed to constitutional norms. But it is clear that the Modi government and the RSS are interested in securing an ideological bias within the criminal justice system. Why are murder trials involving Hindutva activists collapsing? Why was Judge Jyotsna Yagnik (who convicted Maya Kodnani and Babu Bajrangi) threatened and her protection withdrawn? Why was Rohini Salian asked to go slow on the Malegaon prosecutions? Why is the ruling party sponsoring an assault on judicial independence? Do we want the government of India to fall under the dictatorship of an ideology?The Sangh Parivar and its supporters should understand this simple truth: the ideological corruption of justice will destroy Indias reputation as a law-governed democracy. Whatever the stock-brokers, contractors and corporate managers might think of this, the erosion of this reputation will drive Indias laboring classes and ordinary citizens toward desperation; and generate future insurgencies.Violence is an outcome of humiliation, not of poverty. Those dreaming of Hindu Rashtra should study the ongoing disaster in the Nizam-i-Mustafa next door. Akhand Bharat and Hindu Rashtra are mutually exclusive ideals  if you get one, forget the other. If you love India, call off your hooligans and practice the non-violence that you preach to Naxalites.NaxalismNaxalite insurgency in India is propelled by three factors  the brutal injustice experienced by the rural poor; the vested interest of a powerful section of the establishment; and the utopian ideology of Maoist intelligentsia, compounded by the criminalization and logistical inertia of their military machine. The three work in tandem. Each is well documented  we need only recapitulate the 1986 Arwal massacre, the activities of the Ranvir Sena and Salwa Judum; the thousands of tribals in prison, the numerous allegations of unpunished molestation.The scale of the humiliation undergone by the working population has to be acknowledged in order to understand insurgency. The Naxalite project will never succeed, but neither will insurgency disappear. Indian justice is a manufactory for insurgents. A major factor is that many powerful persons want it to continue. Thus, as recently as December 2014, a retiring DG of the CRPF stated that the continuation of Naxalite violence was beneficial for some state governments covetous of central funds. This has been corroborated by observers within the state apparatus.However, people want the chance to get on with their lives  they want justice, but not at the cost of perpetual conflict. The comrades may well dream of going down in a heroic flame, but have no right to impose that dream upon others. Insurgent violence leads only to trauma and the desire for revenge. Dreams of liberation get smothered in cruelty; warfare mutates into a self-propelling automaton. The numbers of ordinary persons killed by Maoists is legion, but we may simply recall the names of tribal policemen Francis Induwar and Lucas Tete, tribal rights activist comrade Kenduka Arjun, NREGA activist Niyamat Ansari and journalist Nemichand Jain, all murdered between 2009 and 2013. Those interested can pursue the details of these unfortunates.And the deliberate derailment of the Jnaneswari Express in May 2010 that resulted in over 140 deaths was a crime that no ideology could possibly justify. Was it collateral damage? When Communist actions become amenable to the Pentagons terminology, we can see militarism for what it is  a doctrine for sociopaths and a pathway to criminalisation.Regardless of the ethics of the Maoist leadership, normal persons can understand why it is the height of irresponsibility to perform actions whose repercussions you know in advance: lifelong sorrow for families of the dead; repression upon the civilian population; a handle for the government to attack journalists and lawyers; onslaughts on democratic organisations struggling for popular causes; and steady erosion of constitutional governance. Some commanders like Sabyasachi Panda (arrested in 2014), had realized the futile nature of Naxalite warfare. The point now is whether the cadre can use their experiences to distinguish between a struggle for social democracy and a suicidal waste of lives.Lost opportunitiesDecades of peoples war and the history of Indian Communism have much to teach us. What is the record as regards human rights, resistance to communal politics and the preservation of democracy? Is it not clear that a section of the Indian ruling class wants to destroy democracy? Are the comrades sure that there is no difference between constitutional democracy and a state under siege by the RSS? India does not need a violent revolution to overthrow the Constitution, but a mass satyagraha to defend it. And that requires a much greater mental and physical effort than organizing a vigilante force.Communists could have made such an effort in other contexts. Consider what might have happened in 1971 if the Communists had made amends for the disastrous Adhikari resolution of 1942 (that supported the Muslim League), by initiating a reassessment of the anti-democratic Partition of 1947. The CPI (ML) could have launched a debate free of the hateful views of communalists, both Muslim and Hindu. But the leadership was incapable of upsetting Chairman Mao. Dreamers of a classless society found it too utopian to question the partition of India. Thus Naxalites became the only Indian party to support Yahya Khan, a bloody tyrant hated by his own people. Ultra-left communists turned out to be moral and mental zombies.In 1990, if left-wing groups had set aside their differences in order to defend the Babri Masjid, they could have prevented the terrible atrocities unleashed by communalists. Till this day Indian Communism has produced no thorough-going analysis of communalism, the most grievous political issue for over a century. And, barring honourable examples (especially from Punjab during the period of Khalistani terrorism), the Naxalite movement has been reluctant to confront communalists.Can Naxalites start afresh?Democracy is a necessity for the workers movement  it is the ruling class for whom democratic institutions are a nuisance. The proper functioning of these institutions requires that people be able to exercise their basic rights without fear. Relief from violence would be a major gain for oppressed sections of society. Forcing Indian rulers to implement the Constitution is a major task that will require mass movements on an unprecedented scale; and statesmanship of a high order. Those who claim to work for the exploited classes must know that society desperately needs relief from violence. If Maoists had the courage to cast aside their futile dogma they could regain a decisive position in national politics.The inheritors of Naxalism should lay down their arms and challenge the ruling class to adhere to the Constitution, reform the criminal justice system, root out corruption; punish the instigators of communal and caste massacres; disband militias including the armed wings of the RSS; repeal the SEZ Act; pass the Womens Reservation Bill and develop the forest and tribal areas for the benefit of the people rather than corporate interests. Such a challenge, accompanied by an unconditional promise to stop the violence, will electrify the political situation. It will place them in a responsible political position; and save the lives of thousands of ordinary people. Too much blood has been shed. Violence is predictable, comrades. Fifty years after Naxalbari, do something unpredictable. It will bring smiles to millions of faces.Speak the truth.Stop the killing.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

The dominant arm of the elite was, of course, the Congress, which was in power from 1947 until 2014 except only for 13 years (1977-1980, 1989-91 and 1996-2004).The present news trend, and expert opinions, are very confusing. You have a marked improvement in agricultural growth, and you have farmer riots in two large states  Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. You have an economy that has been slowing since June 2016, and inflation now at historical lows, and you have economic experts stating that the RBI/MPC decisions have been valid because the wise MPC is looking beyond the temporary decline in inflation to 2 per cent brought about by demonetisation.One of the major objectives of demonetisation was to diminish the role of cash (read black money) transactions. However, if the expert headlines are to be believed, the volume of digital transactions is contracting. What we are witnessing in India is a historic transformation  one that occurs rarely in most countries. It has never occurred in India before, never. But it is happening now. It is a changing of the guard  more appropriately, a changing of the elites.The single most critical factor in Indian politics, from its independence in 1947 until the birth of the Modi administration in 2014, was that the same elite ruled the country. Regardless of political affiliation, this elite had broadly the same political and economic philosophy, characterised by Western-style social liberalism and Fabian economic socialism. In addition, traditionally, the elite was heavily anti-American.The dominant arm of the elite was,The dominant arm of the elite was, of course, the Congress, which was in power from 1947 until 2014 except only for 13 years (1977-1980, 1989-91 and 1996-2004). And except for five years (1991-1996), a Gandhi family leader was the PM or in charge (as was the case during the 2004-2014 period when Manmohan Singh was the PM, but Sonia Gandhi was in control).The influential English-language press shares the basic Congress worldview. Thus, they could not possibly believe that Modi, an unabashed Hindu leader, would win in 2014. There was a parallel belief that the BJP could not possibly win in the largest state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) in 2017. Of course, the rise of a new cosmology represented by Modi wasnt an overnight phenomenon, as things were gradually changing. Starting with Narasimha Rao, India began to distance itself from heavy state involvement in economic activities. Economic reforms (especially for industry) were introduced in 1991, tax reforms in 1997, and the beginning of disinvestment in 1998. With the signing of the nuclear deal with US President George Bush in 2008, the first major step towards the American camp was taken by India.As time went on, however, it became increasingly clear that the old elite had failed to notice and respect that India had changed from the illiterate and feudal order prevalent at the time the Nehru dynasty assumed control. There are complex factors feeding into each other to explain the publics increasing mistrust in the old elite, but it can safely be pointed out that the educational level of average Indians has risen; the old elite mismanaged the economy  and power corrupted the old elite.The Indian people are asking more questions and demanding greater accountability from dynastic political leaders. But the old elite  politicians, corporates, left-intellectuals, academics  cannot be expected to give up their privileges so easily. They will try to derail the transformation and object at every turn: If that means fake analysis, they will do so. If that means intellectual gymnastics, they will do so. The key point is that they must do so.This is a long drawn-out battle, and a healthy battle. This is what checks and balances are all about. Should the new elite emerge without being questioned? No. Can the new elite just be allowed to roll over the old elite? Definitely not. Will the old elite use all its instruments, and cash in all the old I-owe-you(s) in order to influence the debate, even with fake news and even flakier analysis, if need be? You bet. This is one movie India has never seen before. Sit back, learn, comprehend and enjoy.The battle is joined from all sides. Even from within the BJP. The new elite wants to rewrite history. That is its privilege. But do they have to distort history as much as they claim the Congress did? And do they have to ban documentaries, just like Indira Gandhi did with the banning of Louis Malles nine-hour documentary Phantom India? Or, the later banning of The Satanic Verses?It is important that history be re-written  all new-born elites have done that since time immemorial. But why write history in as distorted a manner as the previous 70 years  by obliterating any mention of Nehru? And will you next sink as low as previous historians who find that the actions of General Rawat (defending parading an innocent as a human shield) and General Dyer (who oversaw the Jallianwala Bagh massacre) are comparable? Invoke Savarkar if you will, but also mention that he was not opposed to cow slaughter. And remember your Hindu Vedic ancestors, who not only did not infringe on the diets of others, but also ate beef.In my previous article (Just why are farmers rioting, IE, June 10), I documented that because of good weather, agricultural growth in 2016-17 was much better than the previous two years (4.9 per cent in 2016-17 vs an average of 0.5 per cent in 2014-15 and 2015-16). Farmer incomes had improved  so, riots now and not before? Some experts pointed out that flower sellers had suffered because of demonetisation  true; some others pointed out that vegetable sellers had suffered, especially those cultivating potatoes, onions and tomatoes. And many, indirectly or directly, attributed all of the price decline to the disruptive policy of demonetisation.The same experts are silent on what happened to fruit prices, also a perishable crop and subject to bad demonetisation  fruit prices (wholesale and consumer) are up 5 per cent y-o-y. And they are silent on sugar, rice and wheat farmers  their prices are up 10-15 per cent. How many vegetable farmers in India? Less than 4 million. How many rice, sugar and wheat farmers  close to 90 million.Now, demonetisation. This is aNow, demonetisation. This is a parallel to the farmers-are-justified-in-rioting-with-record-crop-output flake news. And that is that demonetisation was a comprehensive failure because its simplest goal  reduce cash transactions  has not been achieved. The evidence offered by several experts  RBI data on cash and non-cash transactions since November 2016.There is a basic flaw in this lazy approach to ideological analysis. The experts only process data from November onwards, and are not willing (because of the results?) to look at the change in non-cash transactions over the last three years. They compare April to March 2017, find the volume of transactions lower, and conclude that demonetisation was a failure. The old elite could not possibly do a worse job!The accompanying table documents RBI data on all non-cash transactions (by volume) since 2014. For each year, the data reported is an average for the months January-April. Card usage is only for POS transactions (as emphasised by the RBI in its weekly releases). You be the judge. Total non-cash transactions increased by 53 per cent over last year, January-April. And non-cash transactions induced by demonetisation  debit and credit cards (POS), prepaid and mobile  are up 173 per cent. Your sixth-grade daughter will tell you this is doubling every eight months. And you maintain that demonetisation has failed to move India rapidly towards less cash (less black money) transactions?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

PTI Photo Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan consoles family members of a deceased farmer, killed in the recent police firing, at village Lodh in Mandsaur district. PTI PhotoThe farmers protests in Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Maharashtra indicate that all is not well on the economic front, especially agriculture. If such unrest could happen in MP, which claims to have registered the fastest agri-GDP growth at 9.7 per cent per year during 2005-06 to 2014-15, then no state is likely to be immune from it.MP has been a showcase for the performance of BJP-ruled states in agriculture. But it now appears that agriculture could be Prime Minister Narendra Modis Achilles heel. The governments poor performance in the sector at the all-India level  testified to by a growth rate of less than 2 per cent per annum during 2014/15 to 2016/17  has to be addressed quickly, and in a sustained manner. Otherwise, the neglect of agriculture may cost the PM heavily in 2019.What has really gone wrong with agriculture during the Modi era? And how can it be fixed? We focus here on prices and farm loans, although agriculture suffers from a number of problems.The current protest in MP seems to have been triggered by the crash in onion prices, but it also drew strength from the news of loan waivers in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Maharashtra. The seeds of competitive loan waivers were sown by the PM himself  at a rally during the election to the UP assembly, he announced that farmer loans will be waived in the very first meeting of the new UP cabinet, if the BJP were to be voted to power in the state. The new UP Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath, followed the PMs advice diligently.Farmers in other states have been watching, and the loan waiver could lead to a demand for similar waivers in other states  Haryana, Punjab, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. We wont be surprised if loan waivers cost state treasuries Rs 2,00,000 crore in the months to come, taking state-level deficits closer to 4 per cent of their GDP.What is it that the farmers are demanding? Simply remunerative prices for their farm produce. The BJP had promised in its 2014 election manifesto that if voted to office, the party will ensure 50 per cent margin to farmers over their costs. Where does the Modi government stand on that promise after three years in office, compared to the last three years of the Manmohan Singh government?Graphics by Sarfaraz Graphics by SarfarazWe dug out official data of net margins (the MSP minus cost C2) from the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices reports of the last six years (see Graph 1). The bitter truth is that net margins in most agricultural commodities  paddy, maize, cotton, gram, sugarcane  have actually declined during the Modi regime. Moreover, if one looks at just 2016-17 data, there were negative margins on several commodities: Jowar (-18 per cent), ragi (-20 per cent), sesamum (-14 per cent), sunflower (-13 per cent), groundnut (-4 per cent), moong (-7 per cent) and urad (-4 per cent). With a glut in tur production, market prices fell way below the MSP and the real losses were even higher. Potatoes, onions and tomatoes seem to have met the same fate.No wonder there is widespread unrest amongst farmers. They suffered back-to-back droughts in the first two years of the Modi government, and now, in the third year, despite good rains and bumper harvests, they are suffering due to the collapse in prices. Loan waivers are not a solution: They are band-aids and give temporary breathing space to policymakers.The best way to handle prices is to get the markets right. Remember, prices are determined by the forces of demand and supply, and cost enters through the supply curve. Factoring in only the costs plus pricing without considering the demand side can lead to even greater distortions, and therefore needs to be avoided.But how does one get markets right? Take the case of tur; India had a bumper harvest of tur in the last season. But the government banned its exports, private entities were not allowed to hold stocks and trading in futures had also been banned. No wonder, with bumper harvest on the one hand, and strangulated markets on the other, prices crashed, tumbling way below the MSP, creating misery for farmers and causing unrest.The solution is simple: Abolish all export bans, private stocking limits and restrictions on futures trading in all agri-commodities. This is all the more desirable in commodities whose imports are open at low or zero duties. If this is not done, the government will be forced to buy all commodities whose prices nosedive. This is neither an efficient, nor a feasible policy option.For perishables like onions, potatoes and tomatoes, we need more and better storage facilities, linkages with processing firms, contract farming, opening land lease markets, etc. We need to develop efficient, equitable value chains  like the AMUL model in dairy.But there is one problem on the agri-credit front that needs to be addressed urgently. Farmers need cash immediately after harvests to pay their debts from formal and informal sources. Warehouse receipt systems and giving the farmers advances against their stocks is the way to go.The biggest failure of the RBI and NABARD has been on the financial inclusion front: Even in 2013  the latest information we have  of the total outstanding debt of rural households, 44 per cent came from informal sources (Graph 2). Interest rates in the informal sector hover anywhere from 15-30 per cent.Thus, instead of interest subvention schemes, the government needs to focus on financial inclusion if it wants to address farmers problems on a sustainable basis.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5a0531b79855b76bf13c00ff,The crops of wrath,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-crops-of-wrath-demonetisation-4699598/,2017-06-12,,Indian Express,"Demonetisation may not have hit agriculture production but it is the cause for the current unrest Demonetisation may not have hit agriculture production but it is the cause for the current unrestWhen demonetisation happened, many, including this writer, thought the decision, taken at the start of rabi plantings in November, would significantly impact farm production. We were proved wrong. Good monsoon rains, after successive drought years, besides the timely onset of winter conducive to germination, turned out to be strong motivations for farmers to sow, even if this entailed begging or borrowing. They successfully weathered the DeMo storm by simply replacing cash with deferred payments, for labour, purchase of seed, fertiliser and pesticides. Informal credit networks and social capital ensured that, at the end of the day, we had a bumper crop.Where demonetisation did have an impact, however, was in the prices received during harvest: Potatoes in Farrukhabad, Uttar Pradesh, fetched below Rs 350 per quintal this February, compared to Rs 600 or more last year. Moreover, while prices in 2016 had crossed Rs 1,100/quintal by mid-May, they are stuck even now at Rs 350-400. The same goes for rabi onions in Lasalgaon, Maharashtra, that traded at an average of Rs 450 per quintal in May, as against Rs 750-800 and Rs 1,200 in the same month of the preceding two years. Farmers, likewise, sold tomatoes at Kolar, Karnataka, in early May for Rs 300-400 per quintal, down from Rs 1,500-1,600 a year ago.When was the last time we saw all three  potatoes, onions and tomatoes  wholesaling at less than Rs 5/kg, and even retail prices within Rs 20/kg? And this, in peak summer! The above fire sales  the evocative term used by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its latest bimonthly monetary policy review statement  has been repeated across a range of other crops too: Garlic and methi (fenugreek) seed prices at Mandsaur  the district in Madhya Pradeshs Malwa region thats become synonymous with the ongoing farmer unrest  averaged Rs 3,400 and Rs 3,100-3,200 per quintal in April, whereas these ruled at over Rs 4,100 and Rs 4,700-4,800 respectively during the same time last year. Farmers in Nashik, which has also witnessed large-scale street action, along with the rest of Western Maharashtra, had to dump Sonaka grapes at about Rs 12 per kg in March, having sold the same green seedless variety for Rs 45 or so last year.Even more illustrative is the story of soyabean, a kharif crop that, at harvest time in November, quoted at Rs 2,800-2,900 in Indore  that price has barely moved since then, even as sowing for the new season has commenced. A similar fate has befallen arhar/tur (pigeon-pea), which realised Rs 4,300-4,500 in January-February at Gulbarga, Karnataka.That rate, already below the governments minimum support price of Rs 5,050, has fallen further to Rs 3,700-3,800 levels now. Given a choice, will any farmer plant soyabean or arhar in this kharif season?The idea behind throwing these numbers is to emphasise a fact that should be obvious: Whats going on isnt an ordinary fire sale limited to one or two commodities. This is not an isolated sugar or egg price crash, affecting only the cane grower in Muzaffarnagar and Sangli, or the layer poultry farmer of Namakkal. It is about a generalised fall in prices across agricultural commodities. Weve entered deflation territory in farm produce, whose proximate trigger clearly has been demonetisation.How? Well, much of the produce trading in India is cash-based and financed through a chain of mandi intermediaries, processors, input dealers and retailers. While difficult to establish, anecdotal reports suggest that this traditional agro-commercial capital was dealt a body blow by demonetisation. The collateral damage from it has been a haemorrhaging of liquidity from the markets. With the trade, which used to previously buy and stock up whenever prices fell, no longer active  it neither has the cash, nor the confidence now  the produce markets are suddenly without an important source of liquidity. True, this speculative capital was also a source of inflation, wherein, say, a 10 per cent production shortfall led to prices zooming 200 per cent. But today, its the opposite: A 10 per cent output increase engenders a 200 per cent price collapse.One does not know how long it would take for formal finance, banks, commodity trading houses or organised retail, to fill the void left by traditional agro-commercial capital whose transactions were largely in cash. Till that happens and liquidity truly returns, the ultimate sufferer is the farmer, evidence of which is visible in mandi prices and restive hinterlands.But even assuming demonetisations effects to be transitory, there is another elephant in the room in the form of inflation targeting. The finance ministry and the RBI, in February, 2015, signed a monetary policy framework agreement, obliging the latter to achieve an annual consumer price index (CPI) inflation target of 4 per cent, subject to a plus/minus 2 per cent band. While such inflation targeting may have been adopted by some 29 other countries, the Indian case is unique because of the sheer weight of food and non-alcoholic beverages in its CPI. At 45.86 per cent, this is way above the corresponding combined share of these items in the official CPIs of the United Kingdom (10.3 per cent), Canada (16.41 per cent) or New Zealand (18.84 per cent).Given the high weightage of agricultural products in its CPI, the success of inflation targeting in India is predicated on what happens to food prices. And since inflation at the retail and not just the wholesale level is whats being targeted, it inherently incentivises policy actions that depress farm prices (fire sales may, after all, not be all that bad a thing for the five wise men and one woman constituting the RBIs monetary policy committee). That could also explain why our policymakers today are naturally predisposed towards imposing controls on stockholding, domestic movement and export of farm goods, alongside allowing duty-free imports, at the slightest hint of a price increase  while doing nothing when produce realisations hit rock bottom.Inflation eventually isnt just a matter of the prices of goods and services going up or down. It is also about whose prices are rising and whose are falling  in other words, winners and losers. In the current deflationary environment, the farmers are the clear losers.harish.damodaran@expressindia.comFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Apart from the natural calamity of drought, there were man-made calamities, and this column is about how the two have brought about the explosive situation in the country.Farmers agitations are spreading across many states. It is the culmination of the acute distress in the farm sector that many observers have written and spoken about in the last two years. Two years of drought in many states was the main cause. The governments cannot be blamed for the occurrence of drought, but governments are solely responsible for the mismanagement of the consequences of drought. Apart from the natural calamity of drought, there were man-made calamities, and this column is about how the two have brought about the explosive situation in the country.The bulk of farmers in India have no choice but to do farming. Land is the only asset they have, farming is the only skill they possess, and unless they grow food many of them will face starvation. Agriculture, despite its declining share in total output (GDP), is also the largest employer. In Indias economy, the agriculture sector has primacy.The Price of NeglectUnfortunately, the NDA government lost sight of this basic truth. The agriculture portfolio is the Cinderella of this government. The Minister of Agriculture, unchanged since May 2014, is a political lightweight with little clout within the government. (How many of you can name Mr Sharad Pawars successor?). The minister has been neither seen nor heard by most people. The only memorable statement on agriculture that I can recall was when he repeated the Prime Ministers promise to double farmers income in 6 years and when asked if they had meant real income or nominal income, there was deafening silence.On the other hand, the government erred grievously on the issue of minimum support prices (MSP). In its manifesto and in the election campaign, the BJP had unequivocally promised that it would implement the M S Swaminathan Committees recommendation that MSP should be cost plus 50 per cent. In government, the BJP not only reneged on its promise, it dealt a body blow to farmers by denying them even a reasonable increase in MSP in its first three years. The numbers speak for themselves:The ostensible reason for denying a fair MSP was that higher MSP fueled inflation, which is partly true, but to lean in favour of inflation control against the interest of Indias farmer-producers was the height of folly. Some inflation is inevitable, and the government and the RBI must use other instruments to moderate inflation rather than reduce the farming community to penury.Errors galoreThe second grave error was demonetisation. Mr Harish Damodaran has convincingly demonstrated how demonetisation has crippled the post-harvest agricultural economy (see The Crops of Wrath, Indian Express, June 12, 2017). Agricultural products are bought and sold largely in cash. Demonetisation dried up liquidity and prices have crashed. According to Mr Damodaran, never before have prices of tomato, potato and onion crashed at the same time. Same is the situation with soyabean, arhar, garlic, methi (fenugreek) and grapes. Saying that farmers have resorted to fire sales, Mr Damodarans conclusion is, We have entered deflation territory in farm produce, whose proximate trigger clearly has been demonetisation.The third error was when the Prime Minister announced, on behalf of the yet-to-be-elected Uttar Pradesh government, that all farm loans in UP will be waived if the BJP formed the government. More likely, it was just an election promise in a state that the BJP perhaps did not expect to win, but it was an unequivocal promise that has returned to haunt the BJP in several states. Farm loan waivers are neither intrinsically good nor bad. As Dr M S Swaminathan said a few days ago, Loan waivers, though temporarily necessary, do not provide for a secure long term credit system (emphasis supplied). When farmers do not get a fair and reasonable price and are unable to repay their loans, they demand a loan waiver. The holder of the highest political office promised a total loan waiver, why blame the farmers for demanding that the promise be implemented?In February 2008, the fiscal situation was excellent, growth had found a new momentum, and a one-time loan forgiveness to small and medium farmers was justified. The central government was confident it could fund the waiver and so it went ahead and announced it. In 2017, however, every prudent norm was turned on its head. The Prime Minister promised a loan waiver on behalf of an yet-to-be-elected state government, no one seems to have examined the capacity of UP to bear the burden, and no one seems to have factored the fallout in other states. Having mounted a tiger, the BJP does not know how to dismount it. Meanwhile, the tiger is galloping through Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Gujarat.Jobless youth angryThe last straw was jobless growth. Young men can find no work on farms or off farms. Micro, small and medium businesses are not offering new jobs. Tier 2, 3 and 4 towns are full of jobless youth and their anger has turned against the central government. The BJP will not admit its mistakes. Nor will any BJP leader tell the Prime Minister that mistakes were made. Will the Prime Minister pull a rabbit out of the hat? Wait and see.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Shopkeepers and vendors claimed that there are now few takers for the vegetable. Shopkeepers in the city blamed supply shortage and the weather affecting perishable items for the price rise.Until last week, the retail price of tomatoes was Rs35 per kg. As soon as pre-monsoon showers hit the city, the prices went up to Rs60 per kg and finally reached Rs80 per kg by Sunday. Due to a spike in prices, people are not buying more than half kg at a time now, said Chain Singh, a vendor at Nirvana Country vegetable market.On Saturday, tomatoes cost Rs70 per kg and on Sunday Rs85 per kg, the shopkeeper said prices will go up to Rs100 per kg, said Anveshika Singh of Nirvana Country, Sector 50. Other upscale localities such as DLF, South City and Malibu Towne also reported high prices.Vegetable vendors estimate that tomatoes will continue to cost more for at least two months. Prices of other vegetables are also going up by Rs10 to Rs20 a kg, they said.On an average, Gurgaon gets 500 to 600 quintals of tomatoes daily, but on Sunday, the citys wholesale market received 200 quintals of tomatoes, immediately increasing retail prices by Rs10 a kg in a day.According to wholesalers of Khandsa market, prices have increased due to a major reduction in supply from Shimla in Himachal Pradesh, Ladwa in Haryana, and places in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and western India. They added that the situation will remain the same till fresh stocks arrive by the last week of August. The cultivation period in Rajasthan, Mewat, Farrukhnagar and other nearby areas has ended, they said.Read I A month ago, tomatoes were being thrown away in GurgaonThe shortfall and the transport costs are major causes of the price rise, said Pankaj Kumar, a shopkeeper in Sector 30 market.Tomato prices always increase during monsoon. The stock perishes easily during this season and we cannot store it for more than four days, said Ram Kumar, a wholesaler.Haryana agriculture minister, OP Dhankar, said while the high prices are an inconvenience to consumers, One should also realise that farmers had a very difficult season this year.People must also keep in mind that the high prices will help the farmers in some ways, he added."

Thangabali, named after theChennai Expressbaddie, is a catchy name for an eatery that dishes up traditional blockbusters from Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. At the restaurant, we crane our necks to follow the old-world map depicting Akhanda Bharat (greater India), and the 12th century spice route of India. The idea is to recreate the authentic local flavours and make it a foodies haven. Jambotkar adds, urging us to go through an extensive menu presented on a coconut scraper.To begin with we munch on crunchy murukku, dipping the coarse sticks into three chutneys  garlic, tomato, and kairi. We quite like the kairi chutney that makes our mouths water and eyes shrivel, but little do we know that the raw garlic chutney is just our first tryst with a meal that feels as it was meant to keep vampires at bay.For the vegetarian options, we choose the non-traditional: paneer ajadina (Rs. 180), which has cubes of crispy cottage cheese in a sukka masala of grated coconut, kundapura masala of chillies, cumin, coriander seeds and fenugreek. A tad bit too salty, the sukka is high on finely-chopped garlic that we wish had been used more discreetly. The non-veg starter, clams chilli coriander (Rs. 200) is a big relief, and we love the taste of sea, salt and coriander chilli paste minced in a palatable fishy mash. We take a big sip of the sol kadi, but it sets off an unwanted green chilli fire in our mouths. Sadly our crisp bombil fry (Rs. 150) doesnt have enough of a crusty coating and the batter falls apart from the flaky fish.For mains, we opt for the mutton stew with fluffy appams (Rs. 290). Unfortunately, the meat is chewy and the curry watery, separating from the khada masala. Our server has forgotten our order of Kundapur Chicken (Rs. 270) but brings us the side of neer dosa that sadly goes cold by the time our Mangalorean curry arrives. But, we relish the curry with a soft and flaky Malabari parotta, which maybe the best we have had till date.For sweets: the paal payasam (Rs. 90) feels like an overdose of coconut shavings, and we wish the milk had been allowed to thicken into a pudding. We love the gulab badam kulfi (Rs. 150) but it came to us in a semi-melted state, instead of neat, frozen pieces.Despite the hits and misses Thangabali holds the promise of a traditional eatery. What they need to do is fine tune the dishes and while they are at it, fix the uncomfortable seating too.The author was at a preview tasting on the restaurants invite.Thangabali, Mahim; noon to 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. to midnight; 24474499"

The decision was taken at a meeting of the Morcha in Nashik on Sunday, which also said the agitation will continue till their demands for loan waivers and minimum support price are met by the government. The bandh will exclude Mumbai.In a meeting with Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday, a section of farmer leaders unilaterally announced that the strike had been called off. However, farmers in Nashik, Ahmednagar, Solapur and Western Maharashtra continued with agitation, which intensified on Sunday.At the core commitee meeting at Nashik on Sunday, farmers leaders reiterated that the strike will not be called off based on promises made by Mr Fadnavis. We want the promises to be implemented. The CM has been making these promises repeatedly for months now, Ajit Nawale, state secretary, Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha (ABKS), said.Besides an immediate waiving off of all farm loans, the Morcha has demanded that all cases against protesting farmers be withdrawn unconditionally. The committee will meet again on June 7 in Mumbai, and has organised a State-wide conference in Nashik a day later. The conference is expected to be attended by farmers leaders, where a final decision on the mode of protest will be taken. Mr. Nawale will be holding a self-introspection rally in Puntamba in Ahmednagar district, the village where the strike originated, over the alleged betrayal by the section of farmer leaders that called off the strike.Though the government had planned on keeping Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMC) on Sunday, most of them remained closed and reported a drop of nearly 60% in vehicles arriving with produce. There were protests in Nashik, Ahmednagar, Kolhapur, Aurangabad and parts of Vidarbha. theFarmer leader Jayaji Suryavanshi, accused of brokering a deal with Mr. Fadnavis and calling the strike off, faced the wrath of protesters who pelted tomatoes on his residence in Aurangabad.Meanwhile, State Revenue Minister Chandrakant Patil accused NCP chief and former Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar of doing little for farmers when his party was in power. Why is Sharad Pawar showing so much concern for farmers? His party failed to give them a minimum support price (MSP) during its 15-year rule. Mr. Pawars recent allegations come from fear of losing his Janata Raja identity.Last week, Mr. Pawar had claimed the government was trying to divide farmers by leaking reports that it is considering loan waivers for a section of farmers. Mr Patil said, Some people are creating a ruckus and destroying milk and vegetables in the name of the farmers strike.

5a05e6e49855b76bf13c1c20,Fault lines in the fields,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/fault-lines-in-the-fields/article18952749.ece,2017-06-10,,The Hindu,"Abhishek Patidar, 19, had just passed his Class 11 exam this year with dreams of becoming a doctor. His family owns a piece of land  about 27 bighas  in Barkheda Path, a village 22 km north of Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh where they grow soybean, methi (fenugreek) and chana (gram). On June 6, Abhishek went to Mandsaur along with hundreds of others from his village to protest against the falling crop prices that were pushing his family to the brink of desperation. Tragically, he became one of the victims of police firing, taking three bullets on a day when farmer protests across the western belt stretching from Madhya Pradesh to Maharashtra reached a frenzied pitch. He was too young but was keen to join the protest. We grow everything in our 27-bigha land but in the last three years, prices have plunged and ruined us, says Abhisheks father, Dinesh Patidar, 55, tears rolling down his eyes.Price pinch in MalwaBarkheda Path is typical of the villages in this region. With an approximate population of 3,500, 95% of the population is engaged in farming in landholdings that are less than a hectare per family. Abhisheks family members narrate their tale of loss. The last three years have crushed our backbone because prices have plunged, forcing us to sell our produce at rates where we dont even recover our investment, says Dinesh, adding, todays market price for soybean is Rs. 2,500-2,700 per quintal while our cost to produce one quintal is above Rs. 3,000. Not only soybean, prices of onion, gram, methi , vegetables, milk have bottomed while input costs have soared for seeds, fertilizers, labour and transport, he says.Madhya Pradesh consistently boasts of double-digit growth in agriculture  averaging 13.9% during 2010-15  and like many other States, had a bumper harvest following a good monsoon in 2016. Yet as per the National Crime Records Bureau statistics, as many as 1,982 farmers committed suicide in the State in 2016-17. A combination of factors  falling procurement prices because of a glut of produce in the market, a cash crunch due to last years demonetisation policy and the predominance of smaller landholdings which are expensive to maintain  have led to a simmering anger. Like their counterparts in many parts of Maharashtra, farmers in Mandsaur launched an agitation demanding remunerative prices for their onion, soybean and pulses. As thousands of farmers poured onto the streets, stopping traffic, attacking trucks and confronting police, things turned violent and five farmers were killed as a result of police firing and a curfew was imposed across five districts.Farmers from the Mandsaur-Neemuch stretch in the Malwa region, aside from growing soybean and chana, also grow a range of spices and medicinal plants like methi , dhaniya (coriander), jeera (cumin) and ajwain (carom seeds). Yet, farmers in the region claim that prices for these cash crops have been falling for the past few years. We never sold methi below Rs. 4,000 per quintal during the Manmohan Singhs government. But ever since Modi became PM, methi prices have collapsed, says Dinesh, showing methi gunny bags stored in his house.In addition to low prices, what has aggravated the situation is the Central governments demonetisation move late last year that has adversely hit the rural and agrarian economy.  Notebandi has almost finished us in the rural areas. Even after selling our produce, we dont get money in our hands before at least two-three weeks and sometimes even a month, says Lalchand Mali, a farmer from Barkheda Panth.Interestingly, not many farmers in the region are seeking loan waiver as is being claimed in the media. Most of them want better and remunerative prices that cover their costs and provide them income for survival. Believe me, no true farmer would want loan waiver. If the government provides better prices, we will repay our debt. The problem is the government never provides better prices, adds Lalchand, who owns a two-hectare plot in the village.The Maharashtra stirIn the town of Niphad in Maharashtras Nashik district, the main vegetable market, located in a large yard opposite the tehsil office, lies deserted. In a series of godowns that lie adjacent to the yard there is a pink gleam as sunlight filters through to large sacks of onions that are waiting to be transported. In Vittal Sanaps godown, which is nearly packed to capacity with produce, a large truck with a tarpaulin cover has been parked inside for three days even as workers go about their usual task of loading onions into bright red sacks.We had an order for onions to go to Madras (Chennai) a few days back but the truck was accosted on the road before it could get to Nashik and all the onions were dumped on the road, says Sanap. Onions that are left at the mercy of the elements lose their value almost immediately, so for now Sanap is just waiting for things to tide over. The hartal (strike) will have to end soon because there are many farmers who have no choice but to sell their goods even if prices are bad.Onions and other vegetables from godowns like Sanaps go to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) market in Nashik from where they are taken to other cities in Maharashtra like Mumbai and Pune as well as to other States in the south like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, and even Sri Lanka. The APMC market in Nashik is appropriately mammoth  on either side of a dusty road are two large open halls, each the size of a large bus terminus with tall pillars running right through. On June 8, a day after the one-week strike called by farmers in the region officially ended, a small group of women have set up shop to sell vegetables like cabbage, chillies, tomatoes and cucumber. They take up barely a quarter of one hall but as produce is brought in by farmers in smaller trucks, there are murmurs of anger outside with some arguments breaking out as the produce is passed inside. These women are not from Maharashtra, you can tell from their earrings that they are from Rajasthan. These are just small local farmers who want to break the strike, says one of the men. Still, even these small traces of activity raise the suspicion that divisions are beginning to form in what was till now a unified movement in the district.United in adversityAs the major commercial supplier in this region, Nashik may have become the epicentre of the farmers movement but it all started in a village called Puntamba in Ahmednagar district three months ago on April 3, when the villages gram panchayat passed a resolution warning of a Shetkari Sampa (Strike of the Ryots) from June 1. Their charter of demands addressed to Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis included ensuring crop procurement prices at least 50% above production costs, a complete waiver of farm loans, 100% subsidy on drip/sprinkler irrigation systems, and a minimum milk purchase price of Rs. 50.Farmers across the region may find a specific resonance in one or the other of these demands but what seems to have really helped the movement spread from Puntamba across the Nashik-Ahmednagar-Pune stretch of Maharashtra is the language in which the idea of the strike was communicated. Farmers face many hardships but this was the first time Ive seen farmers actually willing to go on strike to and risk everything to see that they are given some recognition, says Abhijit Dige, who owns an eight-acre farm about 60 km from Nashik. Politicians dont know what farmers go through, its not like other businesses. Devendra Fadnavis should come and work in the field for 14 hours a day, work at night in the cold to tend to onion crops, and then maybe hell understand, he says.That same sentiment is echoed by Deepak Rane who has a one-acre farm just off Niphad where he grows cauliflower. The strike should not stop because people dont realise what we go through. I am not able to recover the cost that I bear to treat my crops with chemicals and fertilizers. I work from 6 in the morning; what is it all for? he says.People from all walks of life face hardships but have you ever considered why it is only farmer suicides you have heard of? asks Dinesh Nikam, another trader in Nashik who has refused to take orders for onions and other vegetables because he says he stands in solidarity with the farmers.The illusion of prosperityWhen farm distress was first reported in Maharashtra, it focussed mainly on the prices of tur and arhar dal and the difficulties faced by farmers in the drought-prone Marathwada and Amaravati regions. After two years of consecutive drought, a good monsoon in 2016 brought in a bountiful harvest and the markets were simply swamped with produce. Record harvests were offset by a steep fall in procurement prices for both crops.The plight of those farmers is often referenced by prominent leaders of the movement in Nashik and Ahmednagar though it has to be noted that this region is substantially different. The stretch from Ahmednagar to Nashik, and down to Kolhapur and Sangli where the movement spread is a fairly contiguous belt that is home to relatively more prosperous farmers. The majority of farmers in the region over the past two decades have moved from cultivation of crops like bajra (pearl millet) and jowar (sorghum) to cash crops like grapes and onions. Many have invested in dairy farming (Puntamba, for instance, is home to many dairy farmers).Vegetables, then, are actually only a small part of the produce from this region and while the enduring visual images of the strike may be of vegetables like cauliflower and cabbage being dumped on the road, there are many places where people show us pictures shot on cell phones of roads lined with pomegranates, which is the most recent entry to the crop market here.In Italy, for instance, a village about 10 km from Niphad that was the one of the centres of the agitation, Swarupananda Bhorgade says that about 80% of the village of 5,000-odd farmers is involved in grape farming, sometimes done in rotation with onions. I have been growing grapes for the last 20 years and till about seven or eight years ago I used to sell it for about Rs. 50 a kilo, says Bhorgade. So it was only natural that I planted grapes on every inch of my 15 acres. Now it costs me about Rs. 15 to harvest a kilo of grapes and all I can get on the market is Rs. 9 to Rs. 18 a kilo, he says.Bhorgade attributes this to a number of factors, the most important of which is climate  storms would come unseasonably and the crops would be destroyed. Or there would be hailstorms. This past year, the weather was regular and the crop was good for once but there is no price. You have to take into account how much we have spent on growing these crops and how we will recover it. It costs a lot to invest in crops like grapes and pomegranates, he says, adding that farmers from the region initially tried to rope in their counterparts from Amaravati who grew tur dal but their situation was completely different. They have larger landholdings and their crop is rain-fed. They dont have to spend on irrigation and other chemicals and fertilizer like we do.On June 3, a faction of farmer leaders decided to call off the strike after Mr. Fadnavis announced a partial loan waiver for small and marginal farmers that would come into effect on October 31. In a large meeting on June 8 in Nashik that included about 3,000 farmers and 150 representatives of farmer associations from across the State, that compromise was rejected. The people who met the Chief Minister did so late at night without anybody knowing and the agreement was not along the lines of what we were originally demanding, said Raju Shetti, president of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana that has taken a major role in advancing the agenda. If the government did not accede to the demand to waive all loans immediately and bump up procurement prices, the meeting decided that the strike would move to a new phase of hartals across district and collectors offices from June 12 and rail rokos  in some areas. As of June 8, the meeting concluded that farmers should be allowed to take their produce to the market in order to meet their minimum needs. Look for Puntamba on that day (June 12), says one of the farmers who attended the meeting. The first rail roko will be there, where it all started."

VenkatachalapathyBuying vegetables has turned expensive in the Fort city. Vegetable prices are on the rise, as traders say the yield was less, while the demand was more due to auspicious days this month.According to A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam, the prices would continue to be high for at least the next two months.As of now, the production is less. The prices are shooting up as the demand is high as there are muhurtham days this month. We will have to wait for fresh yield and supply of vegetables to see if the prices dip, he said.On Tuesday, the cost of a few vegetables offered some consolation. Tomato, carrot and beetroot were priced less when compared to other vegetables, he added.A kilo of tomato was priced at Rs. 15 to Rs. 20, while earlier the previous rate was Rs. 20 to Rs. 22. Carrot costs Rs. 30 to Rs. 40, while beetroot costs Rs. 20. He pointed out that most of the other vegetables were dearer.A kilo of onion cost Rs. 12 to Rs. 18, while small onion cost Rs. 80 to Rs. 100 and potato was priced at Rs. 15 to Rs. 20. Brinjal (thorny variety) cost Rs. 50 a kilo, while drumstick cost Rs. 20 to Rs. 30.Beans were priced high at Rs. 60 to Rs. 80 due to poor yield during summer. Green chillies cost Rs. 20 to Rs. 40 a kg due to poor supply this week, he said.The prices of ladys finger was Rs. 25, cauliflower  Rs. 10Rs. 20 per piece, cabbage Rs. 20, radish Rs. 20 to Rs. 25, yam Rs. 40, snake gourd Rs. 15, bitter gourd Rs. 20 and ginger Rs. 30."

Discussion has revolved around an apparent paradox: why are farmers rioting after a bumper crop? But any student of economics knows that prices fall after bumper harvests, which is good for consumers but terrible for farmers. This is why the government needs to step in to buy from farmers at a minimum support price, while subsidising consumers so that they get affordable food. This is what we have done over the last fifty years after setting up the Food Corporation of India (FCI) in 1965.If this system has been in place for so long, why are we still lurching from crisis to crisis? For long, we have said that the solution is to get people off farming. While there is no doubt we need to create more jobs in manufacturing, we must not forget that even in the year 2050, according to the latest projections, there will still be 800 million people living in rural India. And just one look at the state of Indian cities makes it clear that endlessly moving people from villages to cities could actually deepen the urban imbroglio. So solutions have to be found for agriculture  and fast.Use and abuse of soil, waterThe problem with Indian agriculture is that we are still stuck with the so-called Green Revolution of the 1970s. I use the prefix so-called for a specific reason. Yes, there was a dramatic rise in food production. And India no longer needs to beg for food in the world market. But this was primarily a rice and wheat revolution. It completely neglected two-thirds of Indian agriculture and crops grown and eaten by the poorest people of our country  pulses and millets. There is also nothing green about this revolution because, over the years, it has caused a deep crisis of sustainability, economic and ecological. Large-scale use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides has had an extremely adverse impact on our soil and water. Deep drilling by tubewells to grow these water-intensive crops has happened without any reference whatsoever to Indias unique hydrogeology, where nearly two-thirds of our land is underlain by hard rock formations which have very low rates of natural recharge.This has meant that there is now a serious water crisis, with both water tables and water quality falling rapidly. We have arsenic, fluoride, mercury, even uranium in our drinking water, creating serious health issues. What is worse, to get the same increase in production, farmers have had to apply more and more fertilisers and pesticides over time. This dramatically raises costs of cultivation, without a proportionate increase in production. More than 3,00,000 farmers have committed suicide over the last two decades, which has absolutely no precedent in Indian history.Sustainable agricultureSo what can we do to address these twin tragedies of suicides and violence by farmers? First, we need to transition to a more ecologically resilient agriculture. This becomes even more urgent in the context of climate change. Large-scale evidence now exists that non-chemical agriculture has become a profitable alternative. As farmers reduce their dependence on synthetic fertilisers and pesticides, they slowly emerge from the ecological vicious cycle and are also able to dramatically reduce their costs of cultivation, without compromising on production. The biggest votary of non-chemical farming is the Prime Minister himself. He has also launched the Soil Health Card Scheme, which potentially enables farmers to more carefully manage input regimes. The government must announce a comprehensive package to give a green direction to the nature of subsidies in the sector.Second, we must radically reform the management of both surface and groundwater to ensure that the water in our irrigation commands reaches the farmers for whom it is meant and groundwater is managed sustainably in a way that ensures that no one is deprived of their right to water for life. There is positive movement in both these directions within government except for some hesitation in going ahead with a new model groundwater Bill drafted by the Ministry of Water Resources. This landmark Bill seeks to replace archaic British Common Law from the 19th century, which has provided legal legitimacy to the over-extraction of groundwater that underpins the current agrarian crisis. The new law needs urgent adoption and advocacy with the States by the Government of India.On diversificationThird, we require continued diversification to other forms of livelihood, such as livestock and fisheries, among the fastest-growing segments of the rural economy, which could be hurt by recent policy changes. We must also shift focus away from water-intensive rice and wheat. This means radical changes in the way we grow these crops (seed, water and input regimes) but also much greater encouragement to millets and pulses, which are nutritionally far superior alternatives in a country beset with the diabetes epidemic. The key change required here is aggressive and extensive procurement of these crops by the government. FCI procurement focusses only on rice and wheat although this year we saw some initial steps in the direction of procurement of pulses. This is a welcome move but needs to go much further. The best way would be to include millets and pulses in the massive anganwadi and mid-day meal programmes.Fourth, investments in agro-processing infrastructure are urgently required that would enable farmers to move up the value chain. We cannot continue to have them dumping their vegetables and milk on the road. They should be processed before they are sold and farmers must get their due share in the value chain.Fifth, we need to ensure access to credit and crop insurance, especially to our 85% small and marginal farmers. This is why I am strongly opposed to farm loan waivers as they destroy the integrity of the banking system and potentially undermine the extraordinary anti-poverty initiative led by Self-Help Groups (SHGs) of women across the country. So many of these extremely poor women, with more than 97% loan recovery ratios, have helped the banking system survive in remote rural India. All this great work of providing an alternative to the usurious moneylender-traders is threatened by loan waivers.Finally, we need strong Farmer Producer Organisations, to overcome massive handicaps faced by isolated farmers and enable them to really benefit from market participation.Demonetisation crunchWhile many cumulative factors have taken a toll on farmers over decades, more proximate factors explain the outbreak of extreme violence. Speaking to farmers and traders, it appears that demonetisation squeezed so much liquidity out of the system that traders did not have requisite cash to buy the farmers produce. Farmers also feel that persisting with imports, even after clear signs of a bumper harvest, further depressed prices. Having lived in remote rural Madhya Pradesh for the last three decades, I do not recall a crash in prices as dramatic as this years, that too in the peak of summer. In Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka, prices of tuar, gram, soybean, grapes, potatoes, onions, tomatoes, milk, garlic, cumin, coriander and fenugreek are at historical lows. And when this happens in crops with high costs of cultivation and inadequate government support, the impact is catastrophic, leading to what the Reserve Bank of India has called fire sales. Which has also created apprehensions about kharif sowing. No wonder the farmers are upset.Violence shows no way forward. But this is a juncture agrarian policy reform in India cannot afford to ignore. Only a comprehensive policy response can ensure that farmers distress becomes a thing of the past.Mihir Shah, a member of the erstwhile Planning Commission, has lived in remote rural Madhya Pradesh for the last three decades, working on issues of water and livelihood security"

Besides, the vegetables are not being exported across the border. The export was allowed for three days this season and prices had suddenly gone up, but it was then closed, said Mr. Pahuja.Devidas, another commission agent, said that the prices of potatoes, onions and lemons had also fallen sharply compared to last year.Potatoes were being sold at Rs. 20 per kg in December last year, but now their prices have nose-dived to Rs. 5-6 per kg. Similarly, onions are now selling for Rs. 7-8 per kg compared to Rs. 10-12 last year. Lemon is selling at Rs. 15 per kg whereas it was Rs. 35-40 per kg last year. The sales have also decreased to half, further taking a toll on our profit margins, said Devidas, proprietor of Sahil Fruits and Vegetables Company.The commission agents, however, said that the farmers had suffered the brunt of the situation.The farmer gets around Rs. 4 per kg for tomatoes. He not able to even recover his cost. The farmers in Jharkhand a few months ago dumped tonnes of tomatoes on the roads after the price fell to just 50 paisa per kg. Same thing happened in Chhattisgarh, said Mr. Pahuja.Food for thoughtVegetables such as tomatoes and potatoes are now grown in every part of the country so the supply has increased. But it is not financially viable for the government to buy them at higher rate and sell at lower rate in the market. When the prices increase there is hue and cry and the governments are forced to act. Governments fall over rise in prices. But no one cares when the farmer suffers due to fall in prices, said Tara Chand, one of the largest wholesale dealers in the mandi.Governments fall over rise in prices, but no one cares when the farmer suffers due to fall in pricesTara ChandVegetable dealer"

An estimated 500 acres are brought under these vegetables in Kumaravadi, Aanangarayanpatti, Koambapatti, Pillaiyarnatham, Thulakkampatti, Nadupatti, Kallupatti, Karungulam and Edayapatti.The arrival of a few vegetables has virtually stopped for the past three months, indicating the nil yield in the fields, says K. Guna, one of the wholesale dealers of Vaiyampatti. Among them, brinjal, ridgegourd and beans are some of the vegetables which have not come to the wholesale mandy for the past few months. All these crops require periodical but intensive irrigation facility.Since the ground water table had gone down far below 100 feet, not many farmers have come forward to burn their finger by raising the crop.He said that farmers have skipped the vegetable crops for the past two pattams (Thai pattam and Vaikasi pattam).Another wholesale dealer, A. Anbu says he has been complacent with the arrival of mangoes.Never in the past two decades my mandi has witnessed such a deserted situation, he says.A cluster of wholesale markets are located near the bus stand in Vaiyampatti and brisk activity was seen in the past from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. daily at these wholesale markets, with farmers bringing the produce and the merchants or their agents from Tiruchi, Dindigul and Ottanchathiram loading the vegetables immediately. But, on Monday, the vegetable markets wore a dull look.The poor arrival of vegetables at the wholesale market has, in turn, affected the mini-van operators who used to transport the produce from Vaiyampatti to different places within the district and also to Dindigul and Madurai districts.Malayan, one of the operators, said that a large number of vans and taxis can be seen parked at the vehicle stand opposite the bus stand.The economy of the village largely depended on the wholesale markets.He said that most of the van operators were idling at the stand."

After confirmation of child labour in these work places, we sought the help of the Palamaner police. The joint effort led to the rescue of the children.The presence of 31 minor girls, mostly below 14, is disturbing and the work stations are not safe for them. Also, the children at a tender age had to handle head loads of 20 to 25 kg at the markets.Though some children wanted to return to their places, they had to desist from the move as neither they nor their parents received wages, Mr Dhanasekaran said.The rescue parties would visit the market places and pulp units elsewhere in the district to check the menace.District Collector P.S.

Until the 1970s, there used to be a flourishing trade in dried fruits and nuts across the border here. All thats over now. What we have instead is a Retreat Ceremony along the lines of Wagah. The evening I was there people crowded into the stands on both sides, waving flags and singing songs. The soldiers did their little dramatic routine, playing to the galleries with grimaces, boot-stomping and hoisted rifles. They were cheered raucously, the more aggressive the posturing, the louder the applause. Except perhaps for two or three people, everybody else was thrilled with all this display of patriotic belligerence.A dualityFor the armed forces, the performance is just another day at work. Backstage, soldiers from both sides rehearse together, exchange snacks and movie CDs, and peaceably send back goatherds who stray across the border. The amity as well as the swagger at sundown are real, and if war breaks out tomorrow, the killing will be as real. Its a duality they live with. But for a gullible audience that does not have the benefit of nuance, viewing a faux skirmish such as this is to imagine an always hostile enemy. It actively stokes bloodthirstiness.On a larger scale, on mass and social media platforms, just such a stoking is going on  a crude and constant invoking of a bogeyman, a rage always kept at boiling point.Soldiers, who had so far stayed away from political grandstanding, have today been hauled into television studios and Twitter timelines and forced into the same false binary as everyone else  with us or against us, nationalist or anti-national, patriot or traitor. Forcing them to play to the gallery is doing the security forces a huge disservice, and this government has dragged them into the very public and simplistic us versus them debate just as cynically as governments down the years have dragged them into conflicts planted and watered by politicians.Unfortunately, in the Kashmir Valley today, as elsewhere, it is precisely an easy, populist binary that is not available to the armed forces. Who are us and who are them? Citizen, terrorist, insurgent, provocateur, informer  they are all mixed up in one bag.That eventful day, Major Leetul Gogoi broke ethical rules of engagement but, equally, he was an ordinary young man functioning in extraordinary circumstances. It is surprising the Army should have reacted by honouring him rather than acknowledging it as an aberration, but one wonders how much such reactions are forced by a climate where military-political lines are being calculatedly blurred, and by the shrillness of debate that insists on black and white answers to murky grey questions.Sophisticated cynicism regardless, for an overwhelming majority, the abstraction of nation will always be represented by the easy symbolism of soil, flag and anthem. These sentiments drive the soldier too. Quoting Tolstoy calling patriotism stupid and immoral might be intellectually correct, but it is facile and ignores the soldier.This person has undergone years of intense training, a reconditioning of a person into an automaton to succeed in war. Ideals of flag and country have been drilled in so deep that he is willing to lay down his life unquestioningly for these. How do you invoke a borderless world or the idea of nation as sham for this person?Every argument that intellectualises the idea of nationhood without contextualising it enough drives the wedge deeper into the false binary. Worse, it plays into the hands of the jingoistic, desk-bound patriot-politicians who have conveniently made the armed forces the face of the dispute. And its a role the forces are increasingly and naively accepting because it seems like recognition after decades of bureaucratic neglect and mistreatment.Faced with cinematic posturing on one side that claims to respect the soldier and by a dissociated condescension on the other, no prizes for guessing where the soldier imagines salvation lies.The discussion around the Kashmir Valley has now become so much about theories of nationalism, about grandstanding on one or the other side, that the conflict itself has been normalised. By either constantly foregrounding the soldiers martyrdom or by casually demonising the soldier, we are conveniently forgetting to ask why the soldier is there in the first place.Surely it would be wise now for the generals to remember that finding solutions in the Kashmir Valley is not the Armys job, but the governments.vaishna.r@thehindu.co.in"

He is convinced that it is his old city (forget the fact that he has not lived there for decades) which has the best Muslim cuisine in India. Well, its true that Delhis food is called Lashkhari, that is, it the food that was eaten by soldiers. I am all for it, and can happily feast on Dillis kababs and nihari. But I must admit that my Hyderabadi friend has a point. That the cuisine has been enriched by the royal family of Hyderabad  the Nizams  is an undisputable fact.In fact, the biryani that I love the most is the kuchchey gosht ki biryani from Hyderabad. Long years ago, another friend who grew up in Hyderabad would make it a point to come back to Delhi with tubs of biryani from his home city every time he went on a visit there. And we would devour it in silence, and thank him profusely  but only after wed eaten every morsel, for we raced to see who could eat the most at the shortest possible time.I was reminded of that glorious biryani some days ago when a friend at ITC Maurya invited me to a royal festival that the hotel has been organising. Every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, there is a banquet at The Pavilion celebrating the food of a former royal family  of Sailana and Hyderabad (which are over), Akheraj (June 16-18), Kangra (June 23-25), Kashmir (June 30-July 2), Rampur (July 7-9) and Bhainsrogarh (July 14-15).Heart of malai!I enjoy the food of Kangra, though, after spending several weeks there, way back in the eighties, I must admit I got a bit tired of the khatti dal that I ate every day and everywhere. I have had great encounters with Kashmiri, Rampuri and Sailana royal food. I recall eating a kabab cooked with the guler fruit and a shikampuri kabab, with a heart of malai (instead of hung curd), prepared by the Sailana scion in Delhi some years ago. The taar korma of Rampur is an eternal favourite, and I enjoy everything Kashmiri from the gushtaba to the rishta.But I think my favourite is still the food of Hyderabad. The Salar Jung festival at the hotel included some of the best known Hyderabadi dishes  including kachchey goshti ki biryani and hari mirch murgh masala. The biryani was the way I like it, fragrant rice, perfectly spiced and with deliciously tender pieces of meat. In this style of cooking, the juices of the meat get infused in the rice, and I suppose that is why I enjoy it so much.The chicken dish was excellent, sharp in taste and pleasant to look at, thanks to the green chillies, and a taste of tamarind and mustard. There was a paneer timatari  cooked in a nicely tart tomato curry. What I also enjoyed was the arbi kalimirch  a dry dish of arbi that had been in coated with carom seeds and black pepper.Surprisingly, the dish that didnt appeal to me was the jafrani machli, cooked in yoghurt and an almond paste. I found the gravy too thick, and the fish itself much too bland.I think the festival should have included the royal food of Bhopal. I find their rezala, mildly green in colour because of the use of coriander and mint leaves deliciously different. Theres a school of thought (based in Bhopal, of course), which believes that the royal food of Bhopal is particularly good because unlike elsewhere, begums were the rulers there.But I am not getting into this war of whose royal food is the best. Let them all bloom, and happily tickle our palates. And my Hyderabadi friend can turn his nose up as much as he wishes to."

India and Israel are not immune to it either. We are in full agreement that elements which perpetrate violence on innocent people should not be allowed to flourish, Modi said.Here is the complete text of the interview, as released by Israel Hayom:Q) What do you know about Israel? Have you ever visited Israel?A) I got firsthand experience of Israel during my visit to Israel in 2006, as chief minister of the Indian State of Gujarat, to take part in an Agritech exhibition. I am happy to return after more than a decade, and I look forward to seeing the developments and advances Israel has made in this time.I share the view of many of my fellow citizens about Israel. In India, Israel is perceived as a technological powerhouse, and a country that has braved many odds. Many tech-based inventions have their roots in Israeli universities and laboratories and have benefited humankind. These include articles ranging from USB flash drives to cherry tomatoes. The way you transformed yourself from being a water-deficient country to a water-surplus country; the manner in which you made your deserts bloom, are all amazing accomplishments. All these images have made a deep imprint on my mind.Q) Why have you made a decision to go ahead with this historic visit?A) Bilateral ties between our countries have always been strong. In fact, over the years, they have been continuously expanding and diversifying. In the recent past, the steady strengthening of our ties has begun finding reflection and reinforcement in high-level visits. You would have noticed that the frequency of exchanges has gone up over the last three years. No Indian president or prime minister had visited Israel before our president visited in 2015. President Reuven Rivlins visit to India in 2016 was only the second Israeli presidential visit to India.My forthcoming visit reminds us of the deep and centuries old connect between our societies. It is in line with our view that our ties should be reflected in all spheres of our engagement and backed by regular high-level contact. I think that this year, as we celebrate 25 years of our diplomatic relations, it is an opportune occasion to take the relationship to a new level.Q) Does this decision imply a more pro-Israel posture in the UN?A) Our positions at the U.N. are based on the merit of specific issues and driven by our core values and principles. We remain engaged with all our partners, including Israel, in finding optimal outcomes at the U.N. and other multilateral fora that reflect our commonly shared priorities and concerns. India is not in favor of singling out any country at the U.N.Q)Does India still consider itself unaligned with either the West or the East?A) We believe in the philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, which means the world is one family. We want to engage constructively with both the East and the West.Q) Are Israel and India facing the same threat of terrorism?A) Terrorism is a global menace. India and Israel are not immune to it either. We are in full agreement that elements which perpetrate violence on innocent people should not be allowed to flourish. Cross-border terrorism is a major challenge for us. Divisive forces across our border are trying to disrupt the unity of our nation. These troublemakers often misuse religion as a tool to misguide youth in our country and our regions. Terrorism should not be equated with any particular religion. India and Israel could cooperate even more closely and complement each others efforts to fight with the menace of terrorism.Q) Is this a reset or an upgrade of relations?A) My visit has its own significance as this is the first time ever that an Indian PM is visiting Israel. I am confident that my visit will lead to further strengthening of our relations in different areas and also open up new priorities for cooperation.Q) Will you agree to visit Jerusalem and the Western Wall like President Donald Trump?A) The principal objective of my visit is to deepen bilateral relations between India and Israel. I am sure I will visit Jerusalem. Elements of my visit and its program is being so arranged so that we can focus to taking forward our partnership with Israel in all the spheres, including technology and innovation links, agriculture and efficient resource use. Q) What is your position on the question of sovereignty in Jerusalem? Will India move its embassy?A) We believe in a two-state solution in which both Israel and a future Palestinian state coexist peacefully. A final-status agreement should respect the sentiments and address demands of all affected parties. The key to finding a solution to this issue lies with the affected parties. India supports all efforts to find an acceptable solution to all the pending issues, including Jerusalem. I assume the question refers to our embassy in Tel Aviv. We will take a decision on that after both sides have come to an agreement on Jerusalem.Q) Your biography, as a man who grew up in poverty and climbed up the ladder with hard work to become the countrys head of government, is impressive by any measure. But despite your past, you are an ardent supporter of the capitalist system and want to liberalize the economy. Can you explain what shaped your worldview?A) I do not believe in any -isms. I, and my government work with the motto of Together with all, development for all. We want our youth to become not just job-seekers but job-givers. We will adopt all measures necessary to unlock the innovation and entrepreneurial potential of our youth. My yardstick for supporting or advocating any course of action is the net benefit or value it brings to the lives of our people. And when this consideration is put first, the results can be deeply rewarding. I have seen that in my own home state, Gujarat in Western India, where I was the chief minister for 13 years, and now on the national scale in India.Q) You have tried to reform Indian society, in part by the use of modern technology in remote and rural communities that lack proper sanitary conditions. Can Israel play a role in this?A) Certainly. Israel could be a technology partner in this process of transformation. Israels capabilities offer a good match for our flagship schemes like Clean Ganga [the effort to clean the Ganges River] and Smart Cities. Israeli technologies could also be used to improve the quality of lives of hundreds of thousands of people in our country if Israeli innovators remodel their products according to the needs of our rural population. It is important to understand market trends among the rural sections.Q) What is the difference between the approach Israelis and Indians have when it comes to business, agriculture and other fields?A) As societies, India and Israel are both driven by a strong entrepreneurial mindset. Business cultures in the two countries are unique and have evolved from their respective context in which each has evolved. There may be differences in their approach but the Indian and Israeli businessmen whom I know have told me that both have similar scientific temperament.Q) How can we describe to the average person what innovation ties are there between Israelis and Indians?A) I think the average person is highly aware of our innovation ties as the outcome of our engagement touches his life. Our perspective on innovation may be varied by but we both rely on it to add wealth and value to our societies. Israelis and Indians are innovative by birth. India and Israel both support and sustain unique innovation ecosystems. Our common effort is also to link the creativity of innovation with the energy of entrepreneurship.Q) What kind of Israeli imports does India seek?A) We are not looking at a traditional import-export relationship with Israel. It is more than a buyer-seller relationship. We are more interested in a tech-based partnership with an emphasis on Make in India. The Israeli industry has been fairly positive to many of our flagship schemes like Clean Ganga. There is tremendous scope for deepening the extent of partnership in Indias flagship schemes."

The prices of several vegetables have spiralled this month, as a result. Even a bunch of mint and coriander leaves costs Rs. 40 due to the severe water crisis in places in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka where the plants are grown.Traders at the Koyambedu market said the market now receives only up to 250 truck loads of vegetables daily compared to the usual 350-400 trucks. S. Chandran, president, Koyambedu Market Licensed Merchants Association, said several vegetables are now at least 40% costlier than last month. Usually, the prices of vegetables that escalate during summer begin to drop from mid-June. But, as the drought situation continues across the State and also in neighbouring States, vegetables may remain expensive till July, he said.Onion, tomato and potato are the only vegetables that are priced at Rs. 20-Rs. 25 per kg. Cabbage and snake gourd are also being preferred more by some customers as they are priced at Rs. 20-Rs. 30 a kg in the wholesale market. Several customers have cut down on their volume of purchase. Beans and carrots are expensive.Low yieldP.Sukumar, joint secretary, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flower Merchants Welfare Association, said: Even the locally grown green chillies and brinjals are priced high this month as the yield is less across the State. Vegetable prices have been increasing for three months. But Ramzan has helped to keep sales up, he said."

5a060e0f9855b76bf13c343c,Why you don’t feel the record-low inflation,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/why-you-dont-feel-the-record-low-inflation/article19100813.ece,2017-06-19,,The Hindu,"It is not just RBIs forecasters who are likely to be scratching their heads after the release of Indias latest retail inflation numbers for May 2017. Aam aadmi is quite bewildered too. The data shows that the inflation rate, measured by the Consumer Price Index (Combined  new series) was 2.2% for May 2017, slipping from a 3% reading for April which everyone thought was the rock-bottom. The food component of the index actually deflated by 1.1%.A CPI inflation rate below 2.5% is a once-in-a-blue-moon occurrence in India. Looking back at the history of the CPI  Industrial Workers (the older avatar of the index which has a longer history), we find that India has registered CPI inflation of less than 2.5% only in 12 months in 20 years.But if retail inflation is at a stand-still, how come most of us dont feel it? Shouldnt this be boosting our purchasing power and visibly fattening our wallets?There are three reasons why your personal experience with price rise may not gel with the official reading.Where you liveIf you live in Jammu & Kashmir, Puducherry or Sikkim, the inflation rates in your household budget may bear no resemblance to the headline inflation number.This is because the All-India CPI Combined is compiled by collecting town and village-level data on the prices of goods and services across States and then aggregating them.Now, all States and Union Territories do not get equal weighting in the total. The weights are decided by the consumption expenditure within each State relative to the all-India consumption basket. While the State of Maharashtra gets a 13.2% weight in the all-India CPI (Combined), J&K weighs in with just 0.94%, Puducherry with 0.17% and Sikkim with 0.05%.In effect, price trends at Maharashtra carry nearly 260 times the influence that Sikkim carries in deciding the final CPI number. Runaway inflation in Indias less populous low-spend States and Union Territories is unlikely to show up in the form of a big swing in the overall index. But even small blips in the States of Maharashtra (13.1% weight), UP (12.4%) and Tamil Nadu (7.3%) can swing the headline number.This is why, in May 2017, CPI inflation at J&K (6.3%), Delhi (5.1%) and Himachal Pradesh (4.7%) ruled at many times the all-India reading of 2.2%.Consumption basketDoes 45.8% of your monthly household budget go towards food and groceries? Would house rent makeup just 10.1%? Do you fritter away 2.4% on tobacco and intoxicants? If not, the inflation in your household is likely to be very different from the official inflation rate.In order to arrive at a CPI General Index that is representative of both India and Bharat, the statistics office assigns different weights to the different products and services. These weights are derived from the actual spending patterns of rural and urban households as captured by the NSSOs ground-level survey of expenditure patterns across India. The latest such survey was the 68th round conducted over 2011-12. (See graphic).Because the majority of Indian households belong to lower-income strata, the CPI General Index thus carries a far higher weight to products than services.Services often witness higher price rise than products in the Indian context. But in practise, more affluent households will tend to spend a far lower proportion of their income on food and essentials and make a higher allocation to non-essentials and services.One-offsThe official CPI print captures the point-to-point change in the index in the latest month, compared to the same month last year. This makes the number susceptible to distortions from one-off factors both in the base month and in the current one.The CPI inflation rate for May 2017 has, for instance, been suppressed by the base effect. As we know, a bountiful monsoon this year has led to a bumper production of pulses, oilseeds and horticultural crops. This has triggered a rout in agri-commodities ranging from tur and urad dal to potatoes, onions and tomatoes, prompting farmers to protest. Agri-market watchers also add that the note ban and GST impact on the agri-supply chain have led to poor offtake and offloading of stock, thus adding to this downward spiral.But a fall in retail food prices at this time of the year is quite a one-off situation. Every year, food prices usually soar in the months of April-May as they represent the pre-monsoon months when food crops are in short supply. In May last year, for instance, two consecutive poor monsoon years had fuelled a sharp flare-up in the prices of pulses, oilseeds, vegetables and spices. In May 2016, therefore the item-wise breakdown of CPI showed the prices of pulses up 33% (year-on-year), vegetables higher by 10% and spices rising 9%.But in May 2017, the respective CPI index for vegetables was down by 13%, that for pulses had plunged 15% and fruits and oils were up by just 1-2% compared to the same time last year.If we ignore the monthly numbers and focus on three-year trends instead, we find that price levels have continued to creep up steadily. Between May 2014 and now, the CPI Combined has risen at an annual 4.5%.Food prices in this span have climbed 4.1%. In the preceding three-year span from 2011 to 2014, the CPI Combined had soared 9.6% and the CPI Food Index 10.9%.In short, yes, inflation has moderated of late, but for most middle class folk, it is likely to be higher than 2.2%. To get a real feel of your personal inflation rate, you should check out CPI trends in your State of residence, and in the products and services that make up the lions share of your budget.If we focus on three-year trends, we find that price levels have gone up steadily"

It requires eight months of growth and the tuber grows on vines and underneath the soil.With low sugar content and high calories, it is advisable for diabetics too. It can be kept for a year and its taste appeals to children, says Peter. A single plant yielded 12 kg adathappu last year, he says, pointing to a sapling in front of his house.Like many endemic tuber species, adathappu too was on the path of oblivion. Peter then started cultivating them with other traditional vegetable varieties that too faced extinction.Among them were native brinjal, ladies finger, chilly and tomato varieties.It was his interest in conserving native plant varieties and animals that led Peter, an instructor at an engineering college, to take up farming as a vocation.He liberally shares the seeds of crops and vegetables with farmers. Only if other farmers too grow them can our vast traditional species be protected, he says.Pest-resistantThe traditional species may not be highly profitable for farmers but they score on pest resistance and adaptability to climatic changes when compared to hybrid varieties, he says.Peter collected his plant and animal wealth over a decade of search, most of them from tribal settlements.Some tribes and traditional agriculture families still protect their seed wealth, which is the only reason for their survival. With the change in food habits, many vegetable varieties have disappeared from the culinary table, Peter says. One can spot native varieties of cattle such as High Range Dwarf, Vechur Cow, goat species of Malabar, and nadan kapri and karinkozhy chicken species at his farm.An important feature of our animal wealth was its adaptability to the topographical condition of a particular area like the High Range Dwarf. However, it is confined to some pockets and needs protection, he says."

Many of the eateries in rural areas have done away with serving tomato chatni.The horticulture farmers of Vazhappadi and surrounding areas usually raised tomatoes, brinjal, bhendi, avarai, pumpkin, drumstick, raddish, snakegourd, kottavarai etc. Vazhappadi block is a major tomato production centre in the western belt.The daily market in Vazhappadi town received tomatoes round the year from the farmers of Vazhappadi and surrounding areas and also from Arunutrumalai and Kalvarayan hills. The traders from not only Salem district, but also from Namakkal, Villupuram, Cuddalore, too visit the Vazhappadi daily market for procuring the tomatoes through auction.Due to acute drought conditions, there has been a sharp fall in the production of tomatoes in Vazhappadi and in the Kalvarayan hills, leading to steep hike in its price.A box of tomatoes containing 25 to 28 kg which was priced at Rs. 600 by the end of last month, has gone up to Rs. 1,200 in the last two days. A 10-kg basket of country tomatoes are being marketed at Rs. 500.The tomatoes are being marketed at Rs. 60 in the local markets.According to M.G.R. Palaniswami, a wholesale dealer of tomatoes at Vazhappadi daily market, there has been a sharp fall in the arrival of tomatoes in the daily market for the past few days. Harvesting of tomatoes has come to an abrupt end in villages on the Kalvarayan hills. The Vazhappadi market daily market which was receiving about 600 boxes of tomatoes during last month, at present is receiving only 100 boxes.Mr. Palaniswami pleaded for a cold storage facility for storing the tomatoes during the peak season and market the same at reasonable price whenever there is shortfall in the arrival of the same from the villages. The farmers and traders have been pleading for this facility for a long and the government should take steps for commissioning this facility immediately, in the interest of both the farmers and consumers.The price of tomatoes have registered upward trend in uzhavar santhais too in the district.The price of the tomatoes which remained at Rs. 28 per kg last week has risen to Rs. 35 on Wednesday."

More than a month ago, Pudhu Vaazhvu Project introduced three mobile grocery shops for parts of the hills in Tiruvannamalai to reach the commodities to the villagers.In the past, consumers had to travel 20 km to Jamunamarathur to get groceries. Now, these shops-on-wheels take the groceries to their doorsteps. For instance, a villager from Puthur had to travel for 17 km to Jamunamarathur every Monday to get vegetables. They managed with this stock for three to four days of the week, said C. Sevathan, district project manager, Pudhu Vaazhvu project, Tiruvannamalai.The idea was mooted by Collector Prashant M. Wadnere during a hill area development meeting. The project officials responded to his idea with the concept of mobile grocery shops.The Collector asked us to discuss about how essential commodities can be taken to the doorstep of the villagers in the hills and that the services can be done through self-help groups (SHG). We discussed this with SHG members and three groups came forward. Following this, we rolled out three mobile grocery shops on May 20, he said.From then on, these SHG members, who were trained, have been running the show. They take the groceries in mini-vans to villages.Three unitsWhile Amutha and Sangeetha have teamed up to run the mobile shop in Puthur village in Nammiyampattu panchayat, Sivaperumal, a community disability facilitator, manages the shop at Gundalathur in Kovilur panchayat and two members  Shanti and Jayasudha  run the store at Velichanur at Melsilambadi panchayat.The three groups have invested about Rs. 17,000 to Rs. 25,000. While one group goes around the villages every day, two others visit on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday. They sell vegetables such as onions and tomatoes, fruits, tamarind, pulses, soaps, shampoos, biscuit packets and chocolates. All things sold in petty shops can be found in these mobile units, Mr. Sevathan added.He said the project through its scheme, Amudhasurabhi, has extended financial support in the form of loans to these groups.The official said the response for the mobile shops has been good among the villagers.

5a06343e9855b76bf13c4324,The great avocado show,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/the-great-avocado-show/article19201494.ece,2017-07-03,,The Hindu,"You know a superfood has gained serious traction when it makes news, rages across Instagram, and has restaurant menus dedicated to it. The avocado, once happily married to onion, tomato, cilantro and lemon juice, in the humble guacamole, is the latest to get upwardly mobile. It has found its way from the first course in swanky eateries to the last. You can have it smashed, pulped, frozen, charred, tossed in a salad or blended into a shake.Hip millennials have raised its demand to the point where the avocado has become hot rather than humble, and its price point in India is comparable to anywhere in the world.In Mumbai to showcase the versatility of this ingredient is Australian chef Scott Pickett. In two varied techniques, Pickett shows that the avocado can be made to obey any instruction. It can excite your palate and fuel taste buds when simply charred and served with olive oil and salt or sugar. Conversely, it can cool you off at the end of a meal when whipped into a chocolate mousse and served with berries and cherries. Says Pickett, When you use it to make ice cream, you are replacing milk-based fat content with avocado.With great power comes talkThe avocados status as a superfood has made it a talking point over the last year, and not just in Australia alone.As Pickett observes, With the world being so much closer, thanks to social media and the Internet, superfoods that are popular become a simultaneous trend the world over.This is why, there are at least two avocado-themed restaurants worth mention. Amsterdam has locals and tourists mad for The Avocado Show, while Brooklyn, New York, has the Avocaderia. Both restaurants serve up avocado halves in place of burger buns in their burger, while the former even pairs it with hummus and toast, in a nod to the popular smashed avocado on toast. Theres avocado in side dishes as well  trussed up with truffles and oils, served with salmon and caviar, and even married into a burrata.Much as Pickett loves avocado, he isnt keen on forcing it into every bite you take at any of his four Melbourne restaurants.Reining in the fad, he says, I think there is a place for everything. It can definitely be part of a meal, but Im not sure if I would like everything avocado.Experimental muchSpeaking of how chefs and foodies are playing with their food in Australias foodie state of Victoria, where Pickett is from, he says that the lack of an established culinary history (like India has) means that the treatment of ingredients is always under scrutiny.Whos to say what ready means when it comes to avocado? We are actively developing ways to cook and use the fruit at different stages of readiness. If its firm, charring works great, and served as a side with the main meal.A ripple set off in Australia last year made waves all the way to the front pages of western media when Australian columnist Bernard Salt wrote that millennials were unable to afford homes because they were spending $20 on avocado on toast. The furore this generated across oceans simply had more people lining up to see what the fuss was all about. Smashed avocado gained street cred in kitchens everywhere. Now, the time is right, feels Pickett, to take the interest into creating dishes beyond his beloved smashed avocado on toast.Trend mentalityHe wouldnt go as far as the avo-latte though, which is a regular latte served in the skin of an avocado. It was created as a joke in Melbourne before cafs around the world sincerely followed suit. They missed the joke, grins Pickett. Doctors in the UK  where sales of the fruit shot up over the last year  have even coined a new condition called avo hand for the injury sustained from cutting avocados.While the most popular variety of avocado sold is called Hass  named after the American postal worker Rudolph Hass  the latest variety that everyones excited about is the Teeny Tiny Avocado, developed by Trader Joes. Its lime-sized, ripens faster than your regular avocado, and is a perfect single serving. However, it hasnt made its way to your local grocerToo much of anythingAs for that fat content some people worry about, says Pickett, too much of anything is bad. And that is why the avocado too must be only one of the many things you eat. Its health benefits also outweigh the perceived negatives. Meanwhile, people who have had enough of the avocado are calling it the over-cado. Of course, here in India, we havent even got started, not really.Game of numbersOver four billion avocados were consumed in the US in 2016 alone."

Mr. Abubakkar, 26, moved to Dubai in 2015 to work as a customer care agent for a courier service. In February this year, his company transferred him to Doha, the capital of Qatar.Mr. Abubakkar returned to Dubai in June to process his residence visa for Qatar and was getting ready to fly back to Doha when Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and a few other Arab countries cut diplomatic ties as well as land, sea and air links with Qatar. Many of my colleagues are also stuck in a similar position as no visas to Qatar are being processed here, but thankfully, my work has not been affected, said Mr. Abubakkar.Nearly 6,50,000 Indians are working in Qatar, which has a population of roughly 2.7 million. Only 12% of its population are native Qataris, while Indians constitute the largest group living in this tiny gas-rich nation. If one goes by sheer numbers, Indians will be the hardest hit by this diplomatic stand-off.Rising pricesInternational human rights groups have expressed concern over the impact of Qatars blockade on its migrant worker population. Adam Coogle is a West Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch and was recently in Doha assessing the impact of the diplomatic crisis on its migrant workers. He explained that none of the workers he interviewed were worried about the general situation but they have complained about the increase in food prices.The prices of basic items like tomatoes, potatoes and onions have gone up, Mr. Coogle told this writer. A labourer who was spending nearly 200-250 Qatari riyals on food every month has to now spend between 300-350 riyals, a significant rise for people whose monthly income is about 900 riyals. Contrary to the initial reports of food shortages, Qatar has filled the void by flying in supplies, mostly from Turkey, Iran and India. Food is readily available but the local options of fruit and vegetables from the neighbouring Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan and Lebanon have been replaced with the pricier versions from Holland, Australia, Thailand and Malaysia.In supermarkets, it is like a flash sale where the fruit and vegetables are gone even before they are put on the rack, said one local resident. I found only the expensive tomatoes from Holland at my grocery store and something basic like coriander leaves are missing from the market or cost 7 riyals a bunch. Most labour accommodations are scattered far away from the city and many workers depend on smaller grocery stores for basic needs. Such stores, they say, are taking advantage of the crisis and increasing prices. In order to crack down on such practices, Qatars Ministry of Economy and Commerce is encouraging residents to report businesses that are over-pricing supplies via social media.The ramifications of the embargo may sweep into other industries such as construction, as the country prepares to host the FIFA World Cup 2022. A lot of the construction material was brought in through these borders and due to the current crisis, it may create a lag with the ongoing construction projects, which will no doubt affect the workers, said Vani Saraswathi, associate editor at Migrant-Rights.org, an advocacy organisation that aims to advance the rights of migrant workers in West Asia. A delay in materials means there is delay in work, and we have seen subcontractors especially dont have the financial wherewithal to bide over such contingencies. This could mean workers being left unpaid, or not paid in time.Indians, who make up the largest expatriate group living in Qatar, will be the hardest hit by the diplomatic stand-off between the country and its Arab neighbours"
5a0637f19855b76bf13c4575,‘Sexy food and good storytelling’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/sexy-food-and-good-storytelling/article19191900.ece,2017-07-01,,The Hindu,"Openings, especially long-delayed ones, go through their own hype cycle with the restaurant doing its best to keep the wave cresting, rather than come crashing to shore.In case of the long-in-the-making Slink & Bardot, its unique menu, much-loved location and passionate team, each contributed to keep the curious continually engaged much before it opened on May 15. The French restaurant and lounge is made up of four distinct rooms, which are inviting, cosy and yet in the case of the bar, appropriately moody. The vibe here is not stuffy, but instead veers towards a small plate-inspired brasserie that happens to put out clean flavours and inventive cocktails.For the partners behind the eatery, Canadian Nick Harrison and French chef Alexis Gielbaum, the long journey to the launch has been filled with its own ups and downs. The two met while working at Delhis Le Bistro du Parc in 2014 but their endeavour to set up Slink & Bardot started in earnest in February last year, at a dinner at St Judes Bakery, for all of 12 people.A secret pop-upThe dinner, was paid for out of pocket by Harrison and Gielbaum, and served as a showcase for the restaurant that the duo wanted to open in the city. We were looking for investors, we were looking to see what we could do, says Harrison. In attendance were Riyaaz Amlani (who Harrison had been in touch with for about two years), food writer Roshni Bajaj Sanghvi and her husband, as well as Mangal Dalal of Restaurant Week India and his wife, Karishma.Harrison recalls, Basically, we did a small plates menu, very much in the tone of what were doing now. It was a 12-course menu called, The Stereotypes of French Cuisine, Theyre All True and Thats Awesome. The offering instead of sporting names came with phrases such as The French think lighting food on fire makes it better (strawberry charlotte with runny lime and berry flamb); The French undercook their food (grapefruit cured gravlax with salmon eggs, capers, and fermented daikon Chantilly); and French food is cheesy (chicken sous vide with filo wrapped camembert and blue cheese foam) to name a few. I think thats a lot of what the industry is right now, is contextualising, and giving people a reason why its interesting and why they should care about it, says Harrison. Simply delivering good food just isnt enough any more.He continues that ultimately, several of those dishes from the dinner did find their way onto the restaurants a la carte menu now. For instance the French food is rich dish which was confit lamb croquette with lavender jus and The French eat their wine which consists of buffalo cheek bourguignon with fondant potatoes and red wine jus. For the dinner itself, there were setbacks, like the fact that the fridge broke down, and the duo had to buy all of their produce again, as almost everything had spoiled. In the end though, the meal won Amlani over and he came onboard as an investor.Passion and pedigreeThe partners have extensive experience with food but the challenges that have accompanied the opening of this restaurant have been many. Harrison has studied at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, and has worked in London and Ibiza. Similarly, Gielbaum has worked in kitchens in France, Japan, Italy and on the Orient Express. The produce is different, and even the products that you have, like carrots, tomatoes, onions, that obviously we have in France [but here, its] different, says Gielbaum. I really needed to start from scratch. Most of what I am expecting to have is not available, obviously. In France you work with very different kinds of vegetables and meat than you have in India.As a result, for Gielbaum, the challenge was to choose a recipe that could work without compromising on taste, given the constraints. That said, dishes on the menu rarely crack the Rs. 500 mark, and the eatery is sourcing about 90% of their produce from the local market, except for, a few cheeses, charcuterie and Belgian pork belly.As a passion project and restaurant, Harrison and Gielbaum have been able to stay true to their initial meal, working through delays. As Amlani told Harrison subsequent to the dinner, It was the sexy food and good storytelling, that sold him. And the restaurant partners are excited about finally showcasing their food, drinks and more to the city.Slink & Bardot , Thadani House, Worli. Phone: 6002 8555."

Traders at the Koyambedu market noted that 1 kg of tomato costs up to Rs. 45 in the wholesale market and Rs. 5-Rs. 10 more in the retail market.The market gets only around half of its usual 60 truckloads a day.Traders said Koyambedu usually gets tomatoes of different varieties from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. As summer was harsh this time, the yield has been less.S. Chandran, president of Koyambedu Vegetable Market Licensed Merchants Association, said, Many customers are buying only a quarter of what they usually purchase, especially when it comes to tomatoes, carrots and beans that are costly. This has pulled down the sales by 30% in the wholesale market. While carrots cost up to Rs. 55 a kg, beans are priced at Rs. 65. Green peas and small onions are also among the expensive vegetables and are being sold for Rs. 100-Rs. 110 a kg in the wholesale market.Change likelyTraders expect the prices to stabilise slightly when the Tamil month of Aadi begins in mid-July as weddings and functions are not held then and the demand will come down.

The 25-year-old chef heads operations at Le Cirque Signature, at the Leela Mumbai and has created a special food and wine trail thats been inspired by his hometown, Lucca in Tuscany near Florence. The menu includes several family recipes. On Sundays, after mass, my mother would buy fresh seafood and make gamberoni, baked prawns in orange lemon base, Severini cheerfully shares with us.For the chef, Tuscany is the fragrance of rosemary and thyme. And, pecorini reminds me of home, which I havent been in six years, and beef, he grins. Native Tuscans eat simple food, vegetables grown in their backyard, herbs collected from mountains and fresh catch from the sea. They rarely use eggs in their food and their bread is baked without salt. Thats because our cuisine is very powerful. The only challenge I face here is the [in]consistent availability of ingredients. I usually create menus depending on whats available. So many laws change overnight, I cant keep up, he quips, telling us about the one time his vegetables got caught in customs. They were stale by the time I got my hands on them. I sent them back! he exclaims.After a hearty chat, he leaves us to try the food, starting our journey with two types of bruschetta delloste (Rs 1,050). One is a raw tomato, and the other a herby porcini on a pillowy polenta with has a crisp coating. The tomato needs seasoning but the porcini is juicy and gets the taste buds going. The cacciucco alla viareggina (Rs 1050), a seafood soup, has clams, oysters, prawn and chunks of fish in a thick broth which we wash down with a watery Merlot Dazante from the region.In a chat with us, Severini had expressed his concern about creating vegetarian dishes but it feels like needless worry when we taste the gnudi senesi (Rs 1,250). The no-frills dish is a ricotta spinach gnocchi on a bed of tomato puree that woos the palate with every bite. This is how we eat it at home, Severini quips. Next up is tordelli lucchesi rewind (Rs 1,650), is lamb ravioli with a lamb ragout. We savour this with a sangiovese cabernet sauvignon, Castello Banfi.The sommelier for the evening, Margaux Pavoncello, tells us about French grapes that were planted in Tuscan region, giving the wine a distinct character, acquired from the terra. The weather and soil play a very important part in the flavour, she explains, as we sip the medium bodied wine.For our mains, the vegetarians dish is fagotto Florentino (Rs 1,150). The name gets the Florentino title owing to the spinach stuffed in a filo pastry shell with mushrooms. The second dish is the recipe that Severini has borrowed from his mother, the gamberoni arrosto (Rs 2,150) in which succulent prawns sit on orange and lemon mayonnaise base, which gives the dish a much-needed citrusy lift. We wish there was more of this sauce though. A Sangiovese Cabernet Merlot matches the dish, and is a whole bodied, woody experience. While the food shouts Italian yet none of the dishes are clichd presentations. There is barely any use of basil, and its a pleasant change to eat robust Italian dishes.Severini joins us for the dessert course which is cantucci e vin santo (Rs 750). For the custard, I break a Tuscan cigar, which is second best after a Cuban roll, and add it in the food smoking gun, he explains. What looks like slices of bread are cookies kneaded with dryfruits. The server pours the custard, which comes in a thick sauce consistency, over it. The burnt flavour lingers in our mouth, gently offering sweet solace from the cookie in every bite. A traditional recipe that Severini has given his own modern twist.Tuscany Food and Wine Trail ongoing at Le Cirque Signature, The Leela Mumbai, Andheri East till June 30The only challenge I face here is the [in]consistent availability of ingredientsLorenzo SeveriniChef"

Thanks good monsoon, the third advance estimates of foodgrain production is 273.38 million tonnes in 2016-17, higher than the second advance estimates in of 271.98 MT and final estimates of 251.57 MT in 2015-16. Farm growth for the full fiscal has zoomed to 4.9%, compared with a near flat 0.7% expansion in 2015-16. If the forecast of the India Meteorology Department (IMD) for this year holds true, the grain output will set a new record, boosting the growth rate. This is good news for the economy. After two years of back-to-back drought, in 2014-15 and 2015-16, we can look forward acche din (better days) in future.Increased production does not necessary mean more income for farmers. In fact, the pattern of bumper crops and dejected farmers has become a recurring feature of Indian agriculture. Farmers in some states are regretting their abundant yields this year as the prices of agricultural commodities have crashed. Chilli farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, tomato growers in Karnataka and pulses cultivators in Maharashtra are confronted with a severe crisis that has witnessed prices fall by more than half in a matter of just weeks. Even Punjab, known as the granary of India, has turned into a hotspot for farmer suicides. The Centre last month informed the Supreme Court that over 12,000 suicides had been reported in the agricultural sector every year since 2013. The states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu accounted for over 87% of them.According to the Economic Survey 2016-17, the average annual income of a rural household in 17 states is a paltry Rs 20,000, less than the annual mobile bill of some upwardly-mobile citizen in a city. This is primarily because the benefits from his labour are cornered by intermediaries in the market. Instead of the policy obsession with agricultural growth rates, the focus must shift to ensuring fair deal to the farmers. Apart from effective implementation of marketing reforms recently initiated by the Centre through the model Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act, this require more and better managed investment in agriculture. In 2014, the BJP had come to power promising profitability in agriculture by ensuring a minimum of 50% profits over the cost of production, cheaper agriculture inputs and credit, introducing latest technologies for farming and high-yielding seeds, and linking MGNREGA to agriculture. After three years in power, the government is nowhere near even partial fulfilment of those promises."

Israel also assisted India during two wars with Pakistan in 1965 and 1971, according to this 2009 article in the Stanford Journal of International Relations.India reciprocated during the six-day war in 1967 by providing Israel with spare parts for French-made Mystere and Ouragan aircraft as well as AX-13 tanks (also French-made), the Stanford report said.The highlight of the partnership was Israels supply of artillery shells during the Kargil war in 1999 when India faced a shortage.In the late 1990s, a crucial defence deal was the Indian purchase of Barak 1, an air-defence missile, bought specifically for its capability to intercept US-made Harpoon missiles deployed by Pakistan.Read | Modis Israel visit: Defence and fighting terror are pillars of bilateral tiesIndias imports of unarmed vehicles (UAVs) have almost all been from Israel.

I started my career in Bengaluru, where my brother also worked as a chef. He taught me all about food. After having spent five years in Bengaluru, I moved to Chennai. I have been working at Chap Chay, The Raintree Hotel, for about six months now.I have been exposed to different varieties of food since my childhood. I have always understood and loved different cuisines and flavours. My brother and the chefs I have worked with in the last 12 years have inspired me. Every place that I have been trained in, I have learned and mastered a different cuisine under some of the best chefs. From Mumbai I learnt Japanese cuisine, a couple of Thai dishes from Bengaluru, from Chennai I learnt a lot of Chinese dishes and from Kolkata I picked up a couple of Cantonese dishes. So every place has made me a better chef and has taught me a lot. My specialities however are my Japanese, Chinese and Thai food.Each cuisine stands apart in terms of authentic flavouring. For example, we use a lot of tangy flavours in Shanghai food and in Cantonese and Chinese dishes we use very little spice. But we adjust the flavours as per the taste of the customers. In Chennai, people prefer more spices and tanginess, so even the authentic Chinese flavours have to be changed.I think my best and also my favourite dishes are dimsums. I also did a dimsum festival at the hotel recently. I love experimenting with dimsums and create new flavours. Broccoli and cheese dimsums, scallop and prawn dimsums, pork bun dimsum, beef dimsums are some of my most favourite varieties. I try out different varieties because nowadays people look for new and unique flavours.I have received a lot of appreciation for my broccoli and cheese dimsums. Mostly people prefer their dimsums with a dip, so I tried a couple of varieties with the kind of dips too. I tried four kinds of dips keeping in mind the kind of flavours and taste that guests want  spring onion and garlic, tangy chilli sauce, roasted sesame sauce and tomato and onion cold sauce."
5a06559e9855b76bf13c5749,"Fortnight after Maharashtra govt credit line, farmers wait",http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fortnight-after-maharashtra-govt-credit-line-farmers-wait-4739390/,2017-07-06,,Indian Express,"With kharif sowing already at the half-way mark, farmers say the fresh loan may just come too late. (Express/Narendra Vaskar) With kharif sowing already at the half-way mark, farmers say the fresh loan may just come too late. (Express/Narendra Vaskar)Even as the Maharashtra government extended the countrys biggest ever loan waiver package to cover an even greater number of farmers by including all overdue crop loans disbursed since 2009, farmers across the state are reporting their inability to access fresh credit.Amid doubts over conditions imposed for eligibility for the loan waiver, and with the cooperative banking network in deep crisis, farmers have been unable to access any institutional credit more than a fortnight after Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis announced that a fresh line of credit worth Rs 10,000 would be made available immediately to all eligible farmers. And with sowing for the kharif season already at the half-way mark, farmers in regions that have witnessed acute agrarian distress over the past three to four years say the fresh loan of Rs 10,000 may just come too late.Nivrutti Gangurde of Kotamgaon village in Nashiks Niphad taluka had earlier in the year taken a loan of Rs 2 lakh for his daughters wedding. Unable to raise a fresh crop loan as he was unable to clear previous dues, he had to borrow informally from somebody in the village, at higher rates of interest, for the kharif season. I have been overdue since 2014  none of the banks was ready to sanction any loan. In order to meet the operational expenses for my acre of tomato I had to borrow around Rs 2 lakh from a moneylender this year, he says.For Maharashtras farmers now, there is water but no liquidity In Tuljapur talukas Salgara Devti village in Osmanabad district, farmer and postwoman Archana Bhosale says everyone is being turned away from the local bank. Similarly, in Nandurghat village of Beed, local journalist and farmer Amol Jadhav says those visiting the Maharashtra Gramin Bank branch have been told instructions regarding fresh credit havent arrived yet.Across the state, lead bank managers for agricultural loans say the fresh loan of Rs 10,000 promised by the government cannot be extended in the current circumstances where eligibility criteria have been repeatedly tweaked since the announcement and with no master circular from the Reserve Bank of India to all banks on writing off crop loan accounts that are non-performing assets (NPAs) or bad loans.The government and the RBI will have to clearly state which NPAs are to be written off, only then can fresh credit be offered. And banks have seen next to zero recovery ever since the loan waiver demand began to pick up. With nobody making payments on old loans and with no detailed intimation from the government on how to proceed, local banks actually cannot offer fresh loans to anyone, though there are requests every day, says the lead bank manager in one of Marathwadas districts. The Maharashtra Gramin Bank, a regional rural bank, is the only one to have issued a circular to its branches on the loan waiver and fresh credit, but sources say disbursals have remained very low despite demand.The Gramin Bank services 17 districts, including all of Marathwada where the district central cooperative banks are mostly weak or defunct. Chief Manager for Credit and Refinance K D Joshi says a circular was issued as per the directives of the state government to all 408 branches, but concedes that there is confusion regarding eligibility. The criteria are changing daily. Now all loans disbursed since 2009 that are overdue as of June 30, 2016 are eligible, but the government has not issued a circular about this. Until there is a firm eligibility criterion, some confusion will remain, he told The Indian Express.Other bankers say farmers are also a confused lot, some hoping to have multiple loans in multiple banks written off, others simply unaware of the conditions to be fulfilled before the mortgage record can be wiped clean from their 7/12 land extracts. Meanwhile, the distressed district central cooperative banks inability to service customers has added to the slow pace of farmers accessing fresh credit. The Nashik District Central Cooperative Bank (NDCCB) had, by the end of June last year, disbursed over Rs 1,200 crore in crop loans. Once known for its robust financial health, the bank has this year disbursed only Rs 61.41 crore  six per cent of its set target of Rs 1101.05 crore  till now. Chairman Narendra Darade blames the continuing impact of demonetisation for the situation. We do not have cash with us. How are we to disburse money to farmers, he asks.The confusion and consequent glitches in extending fresh credit to farmers eligible for the waiver comes after an already slow crop loan season for Maharashtras banks. By the end of June 2016, of the Rs 37,677.03 crore target for kharif loans, banks had disbursed Rs 20,889.20 crore  a healthy 55 per cent of the target. However, by the middle of June this year, of the targeted Rs 40,547.20 crore, only Rs 9,249.22 crore had been disbursed  barely 23 per cent of the target. On expected lines, district central cooperative banks that disburse around 40 per cent of crop loans have been the worst performers. They have disbursed Rs 5225.94 crore, or 40 per cent of their target of Rs 13108.38 crore. At the end of June 2016, these banks had disbursed Rs 10,451.77 crore of their targeted Rs 13,113.57 crore  80 per cent of the target.Simultaneously, sowing has continued despite the crisis in institutional credit. With healthy water levels in dams and local water bodies, nearly 40 per cent of the kharif sowing is now complete, with over 56 lakh hectares of farm land already sown in anticipation of the promised normal monsoon. At this time last year, only about 13 lakh hectares of farmland had been sown. Villagers say many have turned to private moneylenders in the absence of farm loans from banks. Worse, in some parts of Marathwada, villages actually completed sowing, enthused by the June rainfall, and a dry spell since the end of June has many worried about the likelihood of having to undertake a second sowing, called dubaar perni, a chronic and crippling additional cost for farmers in rainfed and non-irrigated parts.In Dhamangaon village of Ashti taluka, a drought-prone region, for example, a plentiful monsoon in 2016 has ensured theres plenty of water for drinking. But it hasnt rained since the end of June. If it doesnt rain in a week or 10 days, we will have to go in for a second sowing, says deputy sarpanch Dr Syed Bashir. Dhamangaons farmers have sown urad, moong, bajra and cotton and are now concerned about the young crops health at a crucial growth stage.With the weather office predicting a relatively dry July, farmers in Ashti expect they may have to sow a second time. If the promised fresh loans are disbursed now, the money will at least be handy for that, says Dr Syed. If it comes much later, whats the use?Minister of State for Agriculture Sadashiv Khot admitted to receiving complaints about non-disbursal of crop loans from various districts of the state. I will be meeting the chief minister on Friday and ask him to look into the matter. I will also be requesting the district guardian ministers to take weekly meetings with the lead banks and follow up about loan disbursal, he said. Khot signalled that banks who had failed to provide credit on time would face action.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Even as the State got its share of rains, price of the vegetable continues to skyrocket.Sources said, tomato is priced at `70 to `80 a kg in the open market which is almost three times the cost of the vegetable that was being sold at `25 a kg a month ago.The unprecedented price rise has been attributed to supply crunch. While the Capital city requires 100 tonnes of tomato daily, it is now getting half of it. Apart from the locally grown crops, the State depends mostly on Karnataka for the vegetable.According to traders, the red vegetable was priced at `100 a kilo at the Unit-IV market on Thursday. The price, however, came down to `70 on Friday though in some areas it is being sold at `80 a kg.Secretary of Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said the price fluctuation in the market depends on the demand and supply. The supply has been very less from the tomato producing States, he said.Blaming the State Government for the situation, he said, farmers in Keonjhar and Angul region were forced to sell tomatoes at throwaway price during summer. The Government could have purchased the vegetable from the farmers at a reasonable price and stored it for the season. Unfortunately, despite repeated demands, it has failed to set up required number of cold storages, he pointed out.The traders alleged that the retail price is high compared to the wholesale price as the Government has failed to control it. The retail price is 20 to 30 per cent high than the wholesale price, Panda said claiming it should be 5 to 10 per cent depending on the commodity. We are expecting a change in price after the arrival of fresh crop from Maharashtra and Hassan district of Karnataka in next 15 days, he added."

Now, the farmers dont have to worry about middlemen, he said.The consumers in Kerala who had been shelling out high prices fixed by private suppliers for vegetables can now get fresh vegetables with prices prevailing in Agriculture Producers Marketing Committee markets in Mysuru. He said they sell tomato and pumpkin for Rs 6 per kg and started procuring chilli at the prevailing prices in APMCs.He said farmers are saved from paying commission and nobody is there to cheat farmers here.The company that has entered into an understanding with a few societies in Kerala takes services charges.

In what is being regarded as a consequence of short supply, tomato prices have gone up to ` 75 to 80 per kg.Vegetable vendors at the Gudimalkapur wholesale market say that they have incurred huge losses as there are few takers for the pricey tomatoes and some other vegetables.Jaya, a vendor, says, Due to the excessive rains, a lot of vegetables on the farms have spoiled. We are suffering huge losses. For each carton of 25 kg of tomatoes supplied to us, we are paying `1,500-1,600 at present. Yet, most of the cartons dont hold a quantity beyond 22 kg. Such is the scarcity of vegetables in the market. This price hike has led to considerable reduction in customer footfall in the last three days.It is not only the case of tomato but beans too are being sold at ` 70 a kg in many places. As for green chilli, its wholesale rate is ` 80, says K Vamshi, a frustrated buyer at the mandi.It seems impossible to buy vegetables with this kind of price hike. Imagine I have bought 250 gm of chilli for ` 25 just now, laments Md Naeem, a resident of Mehdipatnam.The GST is followed by high vegetable prices. What can the common man do? Tomato is commonly and widely used and I am now forced to pay ` 75 for it. Has the government any consideration for people? fumes Chandani Adhikari, a tech analyst who lives in Begumpet.Another vegetable vendor, L Padma, has this to say: The unfavourable rains and the mishmash at the vegetable market have completely disturbed the demand-supply balance. A lot of vegetables being supplied to us are not of good quality. Today, out of the one quintal of tomatoes I was supplied, 15 kg were rotten.Ravindar Kumar, secretary of Agricultural Market Committee, Gudimalkapur, explains, A lot of vegetables are spoiled because of the unfavourable rains. This happens in the month on June every year but the sale has come down this year. If the situation continues to remain like this, the vegetable market is likely to see a further dip of 10 to 30 per cent in sales.But monsoon is favourable for some vegetables. The rains, on the other hand, have helped in the cultivation of some vegetables. For example, most of the farmers in Nalgonda district have started cultivating dondakaya as the weather is just appropriate for its cultivation, observes Kumar.Sale prices exceed those fixed by AMCA contrast was seen between the prices at which several vegetables are being sold in the market against their retail prices fixed by the Agricultural Market Committee, Gudimalkapur. Tomato is being sold at I80/kg against the fixed price of I54/kg, cauliflower at I70/kg against I32, French beans at I70/kg against I42/kg and green chilli at I80/kg against I62/kg."
5a06ee789855b76bf13c6b76,Farmers appeal for loan waiver,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170622/jsp/northeast/story_158115.jsp,2017-06-22,,Telegraph,"Village elders and farmers address the news conference in Shillong on Wednesday Shillong, June 21: With low returns on agricultural produce causing distress, farmers from the fertile farms of Meghalaya's East Khasi Hills today sought loan waivers and minimum support prices to be able to sustain cultivation. From the villages of Jongksha, Thynroit, Pingwait, Iewrynghep, Thangbnaiand Pyngkya, falling under the Mawkynrew community and rural development block of East Khasi Hills, the farmers today complained of distress because of low returns, disproportionate to the investments made by them on various agricultural produce. These villages, which are around 40km from here, are known for cultivating potatoes, tomatoes, French beans, cabbage and broomsticks, among others. They are part of more than 100 villages under the block with a population of not less than 50,000, and where almost all the households are engaged in agriculture. ""The farmers are distressed because agricultural produce do not fetch a good price. The price is disproportionate with what they have invested,"" Jongksha village chief Olet Kharsahnoh, who came along with a group of farmers to the news conference, said. For instance, he said, this year, the price of potatoes per kg which is being sold by the farmers to the traders is a mere Rs 8-10 while the investment made per kg is not less than Rs 15. With no minimum support price for the produce and with the absence of government regulation, he said the farmers are at the mercy of ""middlemen"" who take them for a ride. But that is not all. If the returns are low, the farmers are further distressed with the lack of manure. ""The state government has been propagating the use of organic manure. But there is dearth of organic manure, and hence we are forced to purchase chemical fertilisers at a high price from the black market,"" Kharsahnoh said. Thynroit village council secretary Harkin Warjri pointed out that several farmers have availed of loans of Rs 50,000 from the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme. But because of the low returns, they have been unable to clear their debts. ""We hope that the government will waive off the loans. This would alleviate the farmers' problems,"" Warjri said. Augustine Lyngba, chief of Iewrynghep village, said even those farmers who cultivate broomsticks are facing a difficult time. ""Last year, we could still manage to sell the broomsticks at Rs 60-80 per kg. But this year, it is in the range of Rs 10-37 per kg while the investment is Rs 40-60 per kg,"" Lyngba pointed out. However, he could not pinpoint the reason of this sudden fall in price. Betel leaf planter and chief of Pyngkya village, Kyrshan Pyngrope, demanded that the government should recognise betel leaf as an agricultural product and not as a forest produce. ""Through betel leaf cultivation, we are actually helping in the conservation of trees. We are also planting trees wherever required as part of the cultivation. We have been explaining this to government officials but till date betel leaf has not been recognised as an agricultural produce,"" Pyngrope said. After enlisting their woes, the farmers now want the government to regulate the prices of agricultural produce, and come up with a minimum support price for the products, besides waiving off loans and providing manure. ""The farmers are usually described as the backbone of the economy. But this is mere rhetoric as nobody cares for us,"" Warjri said."

Earlier, a five-member family had to spend Rs 600-Rs 900 a week for vegetables. Now, it has gone up to Rs 1,300.With GST becoming a reality, several firms have announced big discounts, said Mini N, a home-maker. However, the price of vegetables is going up rapidly. If the daily expense for vegetables was Rs 150 earlier, it has gone up to Rs 250 now. This is affecting the family budget.According to consumers, the price hike of tomato, green chillies and drumstick has left them in a lurch as these items are essential for many dishes. I dont think the soaring price of vegetables will have an impact on upper-class families. But it will be a herculean task for middle-class families to make ends meet, said Thanusha, an ophthalmologist working in a private hospital.However, many feel there is no considerable hike in the prices of veggies post GST. The prices of almost all vegetables is similar even after GST. In the city, GST has not affected the vegetable market. The price of tomato had gone up even before the new tax regime came into existence, said Sujith, CEO of online vegetable market onedaycart.com."

The country is in the midst of a severe food oversupply, say experts, and farmers are selling their produce for prices less than what they spent growing them.It is also a reflection of demonetisation, when farmers did not have cash to buy seeds for Rabi season. The lack of resources, borrowed money, bumper crop and low demand reflect todays inflation numbers and farmers distress, says economist Arun Kumar.Painting a further grim picture of the economy, factory output for the month of May grew at a meagre 1.7 per cent, compared to 8 per cent last year.The subdued growth in manufacturing is worrying as some major sectors like capital goods, automobile and textiles have shown degrowth. This underlines the need for major reforms to improve the investment climate, said industry body FICCI secretary Didar Singh.It was food prices, that have a weightage of 49 per cent in inflation calculation, which brought the overall numbers down. Vegetable prices are in negative territory for the 10th straight month and pulse prices for the 7th straight month on yearly basis, says Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Adviser, SBI in report.Low inflation is not necessarily a good sign in the long run, says Seema Sharma Economist at IIT Delhi. More so because current numbers fall below the Reserve Bank of Indias tolerable levels that ranges between 2 and 6 per cent.It is a bad sign RBI will not be guided by June numbers, but by what happens in July, because it is the first month of GST and it will try to examine the impact on economy. Its likely that RBI may hold current rates, said Kumar, indicating that the new tax regime might make a repo rate cut unlikely.The government, however, has a different perspective. It feels these are reflections of a consolidation process in the ongoing macroeconomic activity. The number of 1.54 per cent is historically low and reflects the firm and ongoing consolidation of macroeconomic stability, Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian said.Tomatoes, however, defied economics with prices skyrocketing above `90 in Chennai. Traders blamed it on demand in Andhra and Karnataka."

(File | EPS)IDUKKI: Term it injustice at the frontier. Those staying in Kumily, the border town of Idukki district, and its suburbs will have to think twice before buying vegetables from the market. Apparently, the prices of veggies from Tamil Nadu go on an upward spiral once they cross the border at Kumily.As per the price list on Tuesday, the difference in the cost of vegetables in the markets of Kumily and Cumbum - the nearest town in Tamil Nadu - ranges from zero to 350 per cent. Authorities are struggling to find a reason for the difference even after the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) system removing separate taxes at the frontiers.In fact, the vegetable suppliers incur only transportation cost, said Joseph Sebastian, a vegetable vendor. Yet, they are charging an unfair price. We cant understand the reason for such a huge difference as Cumbum is only 23 km away from Kumily.The biggest difference is in the price of cucumber. While it costs Rs 15 per kg in Tamil Nadu, it is sold at Rs 50 per kg in Kerala. There is a difference of up to 50 per cent in the price of other vegetables. However, the price of a few other items are a notch higher in Tamil Nadu.Oops! They go through the roofThe prices of vegetables soared in the retail market in Palakkad district sharing its border with Tamil Nadu. The price of cowpea is Rs 60 per kg, while ladies finger is Rs 70 per kg. The price of tomato was Rs 50 per kg and onion touched Rs 110 per kg. Madhu, a vegetable merchant from Koduvayur, said as it was not seasonal, the prices were on the higher side. Ramesh, a consumer, said the budget was going haywire even for a small family. It costs Rs 300 to Rs 500 to purchase vegetables for a week.Salad days are here again Residents of the district can now dig into their favourite vegetarian dishes without feeling the pinch. The retail markets in Kozhikode witnessed a considerable decrease in the price of vegetables after the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST)."

Rains across the country have affected supply of vegetables to Bengaluru.Abdul Hafiz, a vegetable supplier, points out, We get a lot of tomatoes from Nashik in Maharashtra. But due to incessant rain in that state, movement of vehicles has been affected in last one month. We see supply of close to 150 truckloads of vegetables every day, but now hardly 50 of them are arriving. Again, this is a month of marriages and functions, so a lot of supply is going there. This have invariably pushed up prices.Idrees Chaudhary, general secretary of Russell Market Traders Association says, Even at places like Devanahalli, Kolar, Bangarpet in Karnataka, from where we get vegetables, most of the crops have been damaged by rain.Interestingly, for several months, tomatoes were being sold for anywhere between `7 and a maximum of `20. Consumers are perplexed with the sudden rise.Tomato is something that we use almost in every recipe. With the prices shooting up, it has become very difficult for middle class people like us. We cannot limit our consumption, neither is our income going high any time soon. I guess we have no other option but to bear the brunt, said Nikhil Kumar, a software engineer.Venkat Krishna, a manager at the online food-startup hungermeals.com in HSR Layout, points out, We deliver meals at very affordable prices to offices and homes. With the sudden increase in vegetable prices, we cannot hike the rates of our meals. Our customers will not understand and we will end up losing them. Despite the loss, we have to serve the same quality of food to our consumers.

This has led to a sharp fall in arrivals in Chennai which usually gets 800 tonnes of tomato a day. It has shrunk now to 400 tonnes.Apart from the meagre quantity of tomato from Krishnagiri, which accounts for only about five per cent, the traders at Koyambedu pick up bulk of the produce from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.We used to get tomatoes from Dindigul, Theni, North Arcot, Vellore, Dharmapuri, Kaveripattnam etc. But because of the failed monsoon and farmers not getting enough money for their produce, there is a scarcity, added Thiagarajan, urging the State government to look into the issue.Vendors, too, have demanded timely action from the government to solve this problem. Water scarcity and other woes faced by farmers must be addressed soon to prevent the prices from rising further. Skyrocketing prices are a pain to both vendors and public, said S Senthil Kumar, a trader at the market.While the price of tomatoes has gone up substantially, those of other vegetables, though slightly high, are more or less stable, said M Abdul Khader, joint secretary, Koyambedu Wholesale Merchants Association.A key ingredient in Tamil cuisine, tomatos steep price is really burning holes in the pockets of people here.

Located in a gorgeous old-Bengaluru house with the soft sounds of Malyalam songs playing in the background, the ambience makes you forget that theres a busy main road right outside.This outlet recently held a Syrian Christian food festival, focusing on the traditional food made in the homes of the Syrian Christian community. On hearing this, anyone familiar with the cuisine of this community, would expect the festival to be a meat lovers paradise. The festival menu, although vast and mouthwatering, stood out for being in the form of a black-and-white newspaper, filled with little nuggets of facts on the cuisine and the community.To start the meal, we were served a refreshing drink comprising tender coconut water, mint leaves and honey. Next came the starters, and though the menu has several options to chose from, we were served the Aattirachi Cutlets (mutton cutlets) accompanied with beetroot chutney and the all-time Kerala favourite, Erachi Ularthiyathu (beef fry). Both dishes were splendid  while the cutlets were melt-in-mouth, and beef fry had the right dose of spices and cut pieces of coconut. We also tried the Kanava Peralan (a dry squid dish prepared with onions and tomatoes) - this was slightly disappointing as the masalas hadnt mixed with the squid well, and lacked flavour overall.For the main course, the Meen Pattichathu (fish curry cooked in an earthen pot) was what we tried first. The fish was tender and fresh and the gravy was just the right consistency, with a heavy dose of coconut and kokum. Served with Kappa Vevichathu (tapioca cooked and mashed with onions, garlics and green chillies), it was mild (despite the bright red colour) and flavourful at the same time. Next, we had the appams with Chicken Ishtew (chicken stew). The appams lacked the crispiness one usually expects, and the centre was lumpy rather than fluffy. The stew on the other hand, was comfort food at its best - rich, coconut-y and with a generous dose of pepper. In fact, the stew was so good that we were able to forgive the rather disappointing appams. Amid all this meat, what we really enjoyed was the pairing of the popular Puttu with a thick lentil gravy, the combination, which we were told is ideally a breakfast dish, was surprisingly good for such a simple dish.For dessert, we were served a tender coconut payassam. This was a miss personally, as the taste of coconut was far too overwhelming. While we wanted to try some of the other desserts on the menu, especially the fried bananas served with a scoop of ice cream, we were told that none of the other desserts were available. Even when it came to the seafood dishes on the menu, a lot of them were unavailable, which was disappointing to say the least, especially after teasing us with such a vast menu.The Syrian Christian food festival got over yesterday, but several of the dishes are available on the regular menu as well.Cost for two: Rs 1,000 (approx)"

Then 3 kg of tomato was priced at Rs 10 and cauliflower was sold at Rs 10 per kg while garden pea and capsicum were sold at as low as Rs 12 and Rs 20 per kg respectively.Sundargarh Deputy Director of Agriculture RN Satpathy said shortage in supply of vegetables from July to September due to monsoon rain is common leading to price hike. He said vegetable crops grown on upland by farmers from mid-June are likely to reach the local markets in the next 45 to 60 days and hoped that prices would then come down."

He carefully feeds the old destitute woman who cannot even sit up.T Periyasamy and his friends have been doing this without missing a single day for nearly six years. Wednesday was the 292nd week of feeding destitute on roads. What began as a rare human compassion has now become an obsession for Periyasamy and 30 volunteers of Amudhasurabi project.The project offers full meals with water packets every afternoon to 100 persons in Salem City and to 500 persons on Sundays for destitute in the city and rural areas. Periyasamy runs an electrical shop near the old bus stand while the volunteers are from various walks of life. But none, including Periyasamy, is well off financially but seem to have a rare resolve to help the most helpless.Thirty per cent of the cost is supported by non-volunteers while the rest is pooled by the volunteers. They have set up a dedicated kitchen at Seelanaickenpatti. A paid cook prepares the food every Sunday. The volunteers gather at the kitchen on Sunday at 5.30 am and share the work like cleaning, vegetable cutting and food packing.At 11.30 am they leave to give the food to the hungry. On week days food is out-sourced for cash from a reliable source. We ensure that the lunch reaches the people by 1.30 pm every day. We have not missed even a day till date since we started. Most of whom we serve have been deserted by family. We look for people who cant even take a step to receive the lunch packet.In many cases they cannot even eat on their own and volunteers have to feed them literally, not just give the food packet and move on to the next.Water packets were added to the lunch offer when one day I saw an old woman who gets food regularly from us crawled up to the nearby drainage to wash hands and shockingly she also drank the drain water, he says.Recounting the journey, Periyasamy said that initially he visited old age and destitute homes run by NGOs and charitable trusts to offer some help. But he found that help was never scarce for such institutions. But those are on the roads sides and pavements had none to help.First I started giving idlis to 20 persons. But I found many were keeping it for more than a day till it rot. Later I tried giving lime and tomato rice which too ended same way. We brain stormed and came with the idea of providing full meal lunch. This was well received and we saw people eating it instantly. Soon we noticed people waiting anxiously for us to come. That really motivated me to take the full plunge."

We have laid significant focus on food processing and are expecting the industry to witness an investment of about `60,000 crore in next three years,"" he said.He urged the Odisha Government to develop food processing industry in clusters as it requires special infrastructure and said if the infrastructure can be made available at a nominal rate then the industry will witness an exponential growth.""We are major producer of fruits, vegetable, milk, rice and wheat. Yet, we import tomato, pineapple and many other things. Because, the problem lies with the way we are managing our agro-production. Retail-end is fragmented as many do not have storing facilities.

In Luzon, the provinces of Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur surprised me pleasantly: rich heritage structures that stood the test of time and traditions that are still in vogue. Long before the Spaniards came to the Philippines, settlements already existed along the coves in the northwestern part of Luzon. This region was a progressive trading post renowned for its gold mines, familiar to the ancient Japanese, Chinese and Malay traders.As I journeyed northwards, the jeepneys (initially made from the US military jeeps left over after the Second World War, since been developed into colourful public service transport, ubiquitous throughout the country) got smaller and the tricycles (like tiny auto rickshaws) even tinier. Zaza Santiago, my guide complained jokingly, Our tricycles are so small, we find it hard to squeeze into them. Especially after shopping, the tomatoes roll out from my bags and no place for more people.Zaza picked me up from Playa Tropical Resort Hotel to take me to Vigan, a fascinating town (also a Unesco World Heritage Site) in Ilocos Sur, the second Northernmost place in the Philippines. One of the new seven wonder cities of the world, Vigan is one of those few towns left in the country whose old structures have mostly remained intact, and the place is well known for its cobbled stone streets and the unique architecture - a fusion of Native Philippine and the Colonial Spanish styles. Vigan Heritage Village (Kamestizoan District) is replete with ancestral houses that date back to the 18th century, with ancient tile roofs, massive hardwood floorings, balustrades and azoteas in varying Spanish- Mexican-Chinese architectural designs.The Bantay Church features both baroque and gothic influenced architecture. The statue of Our Lady of Charity is an old treasure, made of wood and ivory. Its belfry, a few metres away was used as a watchtower for approaching enemies. There was a horse drawn cortege standing in front of the church, with the picture of a deceased lady: it was decorated with white balloons and flowers.Listening to the sacred music at the funeral service, I joined the line, paid respects to the departed soul, and received the Holy Communion. It didnt matter to me that the departed was a stranger.Neither did it matter that I am a staunch Hindu - what mattered to me was respecting a tradition/faith.A quick look at St Paul cathedral was followed by a visit to Pagburnayan, the traditional earthen jar-making industry in Vigan that was introduced by the Chinese in the 14th century. They were used for fermenting vinegar, wine, salt etc. A buffalo was going around in circles, stamping the clay. The potter turned the wheel and produced some lovely pieces of art. I bought some pots as souvenirs and a paper mache Kalesa, which is a horse drawn carriage, a popular mode of transport.Syquia Mansion belongs to a wealthy Chinese - Filipino family in Vigan. It was the residence of the former president Elpido Quirino. Turned into a museum, it showcases the lifestyle of the rich and the famous in the early 1900s. The floors are made of huge stone slabs called piedra, which came all the way from the Chinese merchants who used them to weigh down their empty ships before loading in the goods coming from Vigan City.The opulence of the family is seen through the numerous paintings hanging on their walls, foot-wide hardwood planks, antique furniture, glass chandeliers and draped capiz windows. The whole mansion wraps around a central courtyard found, not on the ground floor, but at the second floor of the house.After a lovely ride in a Kalesa through the cobbled streets of Vigan, we had lunch at Cafe Uno where the Vice President of Philippines also was expected that day. We had avocado shake, tilapia fish, garlic rice, fried chicken and halo halo for dessert which consists of evaporated milk, ice cubes, cheese, lots of sugar, grated coconut, kaong, gelatine etc.Post lunch we travelled to Ilocos Norte to see the imposing St Augustine Church in Paoay, with its picture perfect faade and the three-storey coral bell tower. The church is famous for its Earthquake Baroque Architecture that is an interpretation of the European Baroque adapted to the seismic condition of the country through the use of enormous buttresses - there were 24 in all. A wedding was underway - bridesmaids of all ages fully decked up and eagerly waiting for the ceremony to start. Zaza was keen to show me the Sinking Bell Tower that is located in the busy centre of Laoag City, close to the public market.

Its price in the Hopcoms outlets, as on Thursday, was Rs 90. Chairman of the Hopcoms outlets G R Sreenivasan said, just a month ago, the vegetable was being sold at Rs 10-20 per kilo. He said the prices are expected to come down a bit from today.Sreenivasan said, the reason for the steep prices was, ironically, its once-upon-a-time low price. He said, Six months ago, farmers didnt maintain the crop well because the price was low. At one point, the price had become as low as Rs 5-6 per kilo. Also, the number of tomato growers is usually very less during summers.He added that farmers have a herd mentality, wherein if one farmer does something, the rest would tend to follow suit. These factors have created a shortage in the market, which has driven up the price, he opined.By next month the prices should be back to normal, he added.When asked if the lack of rainfall was a factor, he denied it. He said it was in fact heavy rainfall which spoiled the tomato crop, resulting in price hike.Prices of a few other commodities have also increased. Banana of the yelakki variety is sold for Rs 83 at Hopcoms outlets, while the cost of various varieties of grapes ranges from Rs 39-75."
5a071f3e9855b76bf13c7dc3,Is inflation falling or steadily rising?,http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2017/jul/24/is-inflation-falling-or-steadily-rising-1632615.html,2017-07-24,,The New Indian Express,"MUMBAI: Retail inflation at 18-year low in June sounds alarming and strengthens the case for rate cuts. But look closely. Inflation isnt falling. Its going up.The misconception is because inflation is widely misread.Its a measure of how much more we pay than last year to achieve the same level of well-being.Inflation is measured every month, but DOES NOT reflect sequential change  the price difference of this month over the previous month  but for say June, 2016 to June, 2017.When the data comes out, its invariably compared with previous month leading to divergent views than that of the RBIs. Retail inflation in May was 2.18 per cent and Junes 1.54 per cent makes you believe its in a free-fall mode.But, if you see month-on-month data, prices are going up. From Januarys 130.3 points, general inflation index in June printed at 132.1 points. Ditto with food inflation, partly explaining why monthly budgets have no respite from falling inflation.Inflation also reflects a change in the base price, not accurate prices. Tomatoes retailed at Rs 3,000 per quintal in Bengaluru both during June 2016 and 2017, but in reality, prices rose, which economists blame on seasonal gyrations. Vegetable prices remain sticky every monsoon. Thats nothing new, says Dr Sowmya Kanti Ghosh, Chief Economic Advisor, SBI Economic Research.Food and fuel account for 57 per cent of the CPI basket, but its direct influence on monetary policy is limited and thats why the RBI seems unperturbed. Low inflation breeds weak economic activity and a rate cut can boost spending and investment, which is why the Ministry of Finance has been pushing hard for cuts.The dominant view is that the RBI is moving too independently, and isnt seeing what everyone else is experiencing. Because inflation is incorrectly compared to previous months data, the clamour for rate cuts is growing, but the Central bank takes a logical view, reasons Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist, Care Ratings.Critics are also pontificating about RBIs error-prone inflation projections, conveniently overlooking the inflation target itself. Strictly speaking, the RBIs Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has to maintain annual inflation of four per cent, with a plus/minus of two per cent. The MPC pegged inflation at 2-3.5 per cent for April-September.It means, Junes 1.54 per cent is well below RBIs lowest band of 2 per cent, but if you take the first quarter (April-June), theres no breach. In fact, the RBI and MPC scored quite a success, smoothly gliding down to the 2-4 target (from 7-8 per cent in 2014) in record time, but holding it here is a challenge.Interestingly, the inflation targeting mechanism was proposed by none other than the RBI Governor Urjit Patel himself. As Deputy Governor in 2014, he chaired the MPC Framework Committee, whose recommendations  including MPC creation and replacing WPI with CPI  were duly adopted in 2015 and 2016.Importantly, three of the Patel Committee members namely Patel himself, Prof Chetan Ghate, and RBI Executive Director M D Patra  are now part of the six-member MPC and to misinterpret and underestimate the collective wisdom is jumping the gun too soon. This isnt to say the MPC is fool-proof. Even with a clear target, suitable instruments and insulation from outside pressures, it cannot possibly foresee all contingencies (demonetisation, GST). Eventually, its decision depends on judgment and discretion.Now the rate cutting part. As eminent cartoonist R K Laxman once poignantly noted, for every ill, the only cure is for the RBI to cut rates. Since January 2015, policy rates are sliced to the bone by 175 bps, yet private investment is poor. How effective will a 25 bps cut next month is anybodys guess. RBI Deputy Governor Viral Acharya, whos plumbing the banks punctured balance sheets, last week made his views clear: cleaning up bad loans as a priority over rates.What does the rest of the MPC think? We will know soon.Inflation challengesIf the MPC fails its inflation target of four per cent (+/- 2 per cent) for three successive quarters, it will have to issue a public statement, signed by each member, stating the reason(s) for failure, remedial actions proposed and the likely period of time over which inflation will return to the centre of the inflation target zone."

But a little bit of chocolate now and then doesnt hurt, added American cartoonist Charles M Schulz. And honestly, as much as I love Beatles, you have got to give this one to Schulz.So, here I was at Smoor, surrounded by desserts sitting across another foodie to find out if this chocolate lounge succeeds in delivering beyond the sweet nothings.Their recently launched breakfast menu features Bircher Muesli, Eggs Benedict, Akuri with Pav, French Toast, Pancakes, Fresh Bread Basket, Fresh Fruit Platter and fruit juices. The lounge also offers healthier option such as omelettes, scrambled, baked egg whites and boiled eggs for the calorie counters.We started off with Hazelnut Cappuccino and watermelon juice. The cappuccino was brewed well and left with a creamy heart to top the smooth blend. The juice tasted fresh with no added flavours. I was also thankful that unlike the usual juices in stores, this one did not come in with a shot of diabetes. It was al naturale.With eggs being my only connect to the non-vegetarian world, the menu definitely pleased me the most as it plays out several dishes to pique your egg fantasies.I always enjoyed the desi masala-based scrambled eggs, and if you are one too, I would ask you to order the Akuri with Pav. It is the classic mix of eggs scrambled with onions, tomatoes, chilli and corianed. The scrambled mix is stuffed in a toasted pav and served hot and I suggest you dig in as long as it is on the table. Because we all know the cardinal rule to scrambled eggs. If it isnt fresh off the pan, then it is not worth your palate.For the foodie friend who joined in, nothing screamed a good breakfast meal like Eggs Bennedict. The knife cuts right through the poached egg, with the yolk oozing right over the salami disc platform placed on top of an English muffin. While the yolk and hollandaise sauce offer this gooey smoothnes, the salami and the muffin together offer a good substance and texture to the ensemble. The dish serves a good portion for one and will fill you up, but I advice you leave some room for dessert. You are at a chocolate cafe after all.Also, try the mocktails. The Green Appletini is icy, with flavours of pineapple, orange, green apple and lemon juice.We ended our meal with Pancake served with maple syrup, fruit compote and caramalised banana. The pancakes are fluffy in the middle with just the kind of brown and soft as one would like.

It started in October when Delhi-based queer rights activist Sharma tied up with Chez Jerome, an expert in French and Indian cuisines. The French chef later stepped down and handed the reins of control to Sharma and his Italian partner Roberto.For Sharma running the cafe comes with a responsibility. ""I have to make sure that this cafe is not specifically for gay men because they already have many spaces in the city where they can hang out. They are dominating queer spaces all around the city,"" he said.With a small dance floor under an open sky and seating for around 30 people, the cafe usually opens in the evening. The menu, inspired by French, Greek and Italian cuisines, could compete with any eatery in the city.On offer are a variety of salads, omelettes, pastas as well as thin crust pizzas with traditional toppings and dips. Specialties of the house include Greek chicken potato salad, a delicate mix of potatoes, onions, tomatoes and chicken salami, Parisian salad dressed with fresh lettuce and fresh parmesan and freshly baked breads.But it's not all about food. With events like book reading sessions and trans nights, Sharma wants to sensitise his customers about queer rights beyond Section 377  the Indian Penal Code section that criminalises sexual acts ""against the order of nature"".""Obviously, the cafe is not any NGO but it also not a place where people should only come to enjoy. I want to utilise this space to revolutionise the struggle we are going through in India. The transgenders, lesbians and hijra folks of our community need more such spaces,"" said Sharma.Despite falling under the broader queer umbrella, gay men stand out from others in the trans community. As a result, transgenders don't feel safe even in those places where they should be welcome, he said.Delhi is amongst the few cities in the country where late night parties in five-star hotels welcome people from the queer community. But few trans people make it inside the elite doors. Simran Shaikh, a transgender and senior programme officer at Sexuality Gender and Rights at Alliance India, echoes Sharma and welcomes safer places for the community but associates the profound segregation more with ""class"" than ""gender"".""The segregation among the LGBTQ is only of class and not of gender. The discrimination happens when you are not associated with a particular class of a party. ""I don't foresee any such changes with these cafes and bars. There will still be class differences in particular parties where there might not be trans identified individuals,"" she said.According to LGBTQ activist Harish Iyer, homophobia within homosexuals is ""rampant"". ""It is sad but true. Just because one belongs to an oppressed community (queer) doesn't make them sensitive to everyone else. Gay men rule the roost in many spaces.""I think some gay men have an issue with effeminacy. It is just another form of misogyny that runs deep in our society. Some do so, so that they don't get noticed as gay, in the company of those who look gay,"" the Mumbai-based activist said. Praful Baweja, who is also based in Mumbai and is an activist, hopes that the workshops he has been organising will change things for the better for the community. ""Usually when one is looking for employees in any company, the person wants them to be trustworthy.Praful Baweja, who is also based in Mumbai and is an activist, hopes that the workshops he has been organising will change things for the better for the community. ""Usually when one is looking for employees in any company, the person wants them to be trustworthy.The question of orientation is usually hidden. With workshops we are trying to tell people from the community to not be bothered by their orientation. ""Usually MNCs have a diversity and Inclusion unit where gender issues are addressed, but in smaller companies they may not have such a facility,"" he said.""Through workshops we want to educate even trans people about company structures and how they can contribute in starting small scale businesses. We are also trying to facilitate information of people within the community so that they can connect to each other,"" he added. More spaces like the Q Cafe, they hope, will help in strengthening this connect."

Usually in a pot? No! A seasoned urban gardener thinks beyond the pot, way beyond the pot. For him/her, a plant grows in a container, which can be anything from an empty soft drink bottle to a broken coconut shell to tetra packs. Basically anything that can hold the most important ingredient required for a plants growth, water and soil (rather potting mix). An oil can, an unused helmet, a vegetable/milk crate, packaged wood, a good thick UV treated plastic grow bag, 1/2/5/10 litre water bottle/can, used paint bucket, PVC pipe or aata (wheat flour) bags. Plastic rice/cement bags are not advised as they disintegrate faster.Most of the pots available in the market are made out of good quality plastic. They are safe to grow edible or flowering plants. Plastic pots and grow bags typically last upto 2 years, based on the amount of exposure to the elements. Plastic paint buckets are much stronger and will last longer. But do ensure that they have been thoroughly cleaned multiple times with soap and hot/warm water. There are other options such as clay, mud, terracotta pots but they are heavier, therefore not preferred by many urban gardeners.Heres how to spot a container and the right plants for itShallow containers with about six inches of potting mix are good for growing leafy vegetables, such as mint, spinach, coriander and fenugreek. Coriander and fenugreek are one time harvest plants, so they can be grown in smaller containers, such as empty water bottles, tetra pack cartons, ice cream / sweets boxes and curd containers. Mint keeps regrowing, so a long lasting shallow container, tray/tub kind is better. Same holds good for spinach as well, since one can get multiple harvests from a spinach plant.These two boxes are from recycled wood used to grow spinach and lettuce.Creepers, such as gourds and cucumbers, require a good support structure or trellis to cling on to. Here is a wooden trellis fixed on to a plastic crate.Fenugreek growing well in another packing box.Grow non-edible flowering plants in converted old tyres. Pictured here are rain lily and aloe vera.Below is a DIY packing wood container, used by vegetable vendors. Cover all the sides with a tarpaulin sheet, they can last a few months.A brinjal plant if taken good care of, can last upto 3 years. So to provide ample nutrition a wider container like a discarded bath tub serves the right purposeFor fruit plants, youll need a large drum of capacity of 100L or more, to allow the roots some space to expand and get a good hold of the soil. If these are grown on the terrace, do make sure that they are placed nearer to the walls or on the load bearing walls, so that the weight is taken up by the columns and beams of the structure.Transplanted an orange sapling into an approximate 100 L drum.These recycled drums have been thoroughly washed and cleaned and cut into half and are being used to grow betel leaf plant. Take away containers are placed in this separately to grow coriander.Vertical gardening is a new trend, used by many restaurants, hotel and corporate offices to go green. Shown below is a very simple DIY structure, mainly used here for succulents and cacti.Succulents and cacti can be grown in small wooden boxes or in hanging glass bowls or small fancy buckets or in an old jug or in colourful planters. Since these need not be watered, they dont need drain holes.This is what a new unused packing box looks like.For bushier plants such as tomato, brinjal, capsicum or chilly, you can grow two plants in these type of vegetable/milk crates. Use a tarpaulin sheet as inner lining, so that it holds the potting mix.The following image has multiple Thai basil plants in one crate."

Seeing the demand for tomatoes, middlemen and retailers have hiked the prices. Few farmers said middlemen decide the price to a large extent.We toil in fields but the profits are taken away by others. As tomatoes cant be kept for more than three days, we have to sell it at the best available price, said a farmer in Dharwad.We sell a basket of 8kg tomatoes for about `350-`450. We also have to pay for transportation and labour charges. But in the retail market, the same tomato is being sold at `100 per kg. We sell tomatoes to middlemen as they take the entire quantity at one go, he added.Horticulture Department deputy director S B Diddimani said, Vegetable prices go up every year. But this year, the prices have gone too high. They may come down and get stabilised in another 15 days.Scarcity of rain and decrease in sowing areas are the reasons for price hike. Once tomatoes from districts like Belagavi and Kolar start arriving in the city market, the burden of price hike will be eased, he added.The middlemen at the APMC yard say they are blamed whenever the prices go up. Many retailers buy produce on credit. We pay labour charges to distribute the vegetables. We hardly get `50 to `60 profit a basket, they said.Potato farmers in Hassan a worried lotHassan: Potato farmers in Hassan are a worried lot as they incurred crop loss consecutively for five years. Moreover, the growing area of potato by small and medium farmers has been drastically decreased from 61,000 hectares to 10,087 in 10 years. Statistics available with Express show that small farmers who cultivate on less than five acres have switched over to alternative crops like maize and ginger due to crop loss. On the other hand, the farmers who are cultivating on more than five acres have leased out their land to Ginger growers. Horticulture officials are anxious as the certified seeds supplied by the department in 1,266 hectares were damaged due to dry spell. The department had brought the certified seeds from Punjab and supplied it to 2,094 farmers at a subsidised rate.The officials had promised compensation if crop loss was reported, but no action has been initiated so far.Dilemma of Tomato GrowersEvery acre approximately needs 50 gram tomato seeds and after seeds start sprouting, they will be planted.

I could sense that the prices would go up further. Before that, a kilogram of tomatoes was generally available for around Rs30. Some vegetable vendors are even selling it at Rs100 per kg. My neighbours have reduced the quantity of tomatoes in their cooking, Shashikant of Sector 20 said.The price of tomatoes has gone up drastically in the last 15 days, forcing people to rethink their cooking recipes that are heavily dependant on the vegetable.

We have started using tomato puree and that too in low quantity as an alternative, said Preeti Singh, a Kavi Nagar resident.Officials at the agriculture marketing department said consumers will have to wait till November for a price correction as the local produce will start arriving by then.The price rise is the result of the exhaustion of the local produce, which is not coming in due to monsoon.

(File Photo) Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh. (File Photo)The Opposition and the ruling BJP on Tuesday traded blame in the Rajya Sabha over distress in the agriculture community due to which farmers have been committing suicides in large numbers. As the House took up a discussion on the agrarian crisis, the Opposition blamed the government for the problem, accusing it of being insensitive towards the farmers issues. They also sought to find faults in various policies of the government. The ruling side hit back, saying the present miserable condition of the farmers was due to the Congress partys rule of 60 years.The BJP members said it was the Modi government which had initiated a slew of programmes for the welfare of farmers over the last three years.Initiating the discussion on the farmers distress leading to rise in the incidents of thier suicide, Digvijay Singh (Cong) accused the government of being insensitive to plight of the agriculturists.He referred to the police firing on a violent agitation by farmers in Madhya Pradesh recently and said the agriculturists faced bullets on the centenary of Champaran agitation in which Mahatma Gandhi had raised his voice against British exploitation.He termed the imposition of import-export duties on foodgrains as one of the biggest scams.He said despite the bumper crop, import duty on wheat was reduced initially to 10 per cent from 25 per cent and then to zero in December, impacting farmers adversely as imported wheat was avaiable at cheaper prices.Foodgrain imports, which stood at Rs 134 crore in 2014-15, have risen to Rs 9,009 crore now, he said.Singh alleged that it was the wrong import-export policies which had led to imports of Rs 1,40,268 crore in 2015-16 as against Rs 56,000 crore in 2011-12.Quoting agriculture scientist MS Swaminathan to say that import of agricultural commodities was like outsourcing farmers skill to outside, he said there was a need for fixing import-export levies by the Commerce Ministry in consultation with Agriculture Ministry.Expressing concern over 42 per cent rise in incidents of suicide in 2014-15 in the country, Singh said agriculture has been reduced to loss-making proposition despite it contributing about 17 per cent to the GDP.He also alleged that there was corruption in Food Corporation of India (FCI) and National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED).The Congress leader alleged that after demonetisation, it was restrictions on cattle sale that had hit the farmers.He quoted Savarkar as saying that he was against ban on cow slaughter.Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Singh said that others in the Cabinet were helpless as it was PM who decided everything.He alleged that the crop insurance policy was nothing but a way to benefit industrialists.Minister of State for Agriculture Parshottam Rupala, who spoke in the capacity of a BJP member, said it was the Congress partys rule of 60 years which had resulted in the miserable condition of the farmers.There should be a discussion on the policies of previous governments and what all they did for farm sector, he said.He said the Modi government had taken a number of steps for the betterment of the farmers.Listing out the schemes, he said Rs 50,000 crore has been allocated for PM Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY) and 22 schemes under the project have already seen the light of the day.Under the programme, plans for irrigation at district level have been formulated, Rupala said.Ram Gopal Yadav of Samajwadi Party said the farmers have been affected because of import of agri products, which he alleged was being allowed because of ulterior motives while farmers are being deprived of remunerative prices.The prices of many agri-items have fallen below the minium support prices and, in some crops, it is not enough to meet even the transportation cost, he said.Citing the example of tomato prices that have risen sharply to about Rs 100 per kg, he said the prices are low when crops are harvested, but these rise after farmers sell their produce in the market.He said the futures market was also responsible for the farmers plight.Yadav said the agri growth has largely been below 4 per cent in last 25-30 years and that the farmers economic condition would not improve unless there is a sustainable growth in the sector.Yadav said the government has put tractors and pump sets in higher tax rate under the new GST regime and demanded that these items should be exempted from GST.Food processing in the country is in such a bad shape that every year fruits and vegetables worth Rs 50,000 crore to Rs 60,000 crore rot in the country, he said.Food processing percentage in India is barely 4 per cent as compared to 80 per cent in nations like Brazil, he added.He wanted to know under what circumstances private companies were roped in crop insurance scheme which was handled by the government companies earlier.He also wondered as to why the government could not use technology so that Indian apples could also last more unlike those imported from the US.Prasanna Acharya (BJD) sought to know from the government why farmers are committing suicide and are protesting on streets if the agriculture growth was high.He said farmers are not getting returns for their produce and are being cheated, not by Monsoon but by the government. Demonetisation has further aggravated their woes, he added.While the new crop insurance policy is better than the previous ones, it is benefitting private insurers more, he said.He said the Centre and states should take steps to fulfill three main demands of farmers  price, pension and prestige.Munquad Ali (BSP) said farmers situation is very bad in the country and that there has been a rise in farmers suicides in the last three years.Why it is happening? Why the government is not finding solution farmers problems? .I request the government not to give false promises. Please work for the welfare of farmers, he said.Praful Patel of NCP pitched for modern farm technologies like genetically modified crops to boost farm income,.It is unfortunate. I am sorry to say that we have neglected science and technology. There may be different views on BT technology but we have data how it benefits. We need to take benefit of it, he said.Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh has always focused on indigenous (technologies) but there is a need to use modern technology to improve farmers income, he said and suggested the minister to keep open mind on the issue of technology.Patel also spoke about shortcomings in the new crop insurance scheme and suggested the government to keep a watch on private insurers who are implementing it.Vijaysai Reddy (YSRCP) said the government needs to introspect why 12,000 farmers are committing suicides every year despite the government coming out with new schemes.He demanded that the loan waiver announced in some states need to be implemented in letter and spirite, claims under new crop insurance scheme should be settled in 15 days, better credit facility and creation of special agri-zones for farmers for better realisation.R S Bharathi (DMK) attacked the Prime Minister for not meeting the protesting Tamil Nadu farmers in Delhi and demanded a special session of Parliament to discuss the farmers issue and a special law to address their woes.Rajani Patil (Cong) said, I dont think the number (of farmers suicides will come down if the government does not take steps.She attacked Modi for not visiting affected farmers in Maharashtra, saying the prime minister has time to travel around the globe but no time for farmers in the state.Turning to Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh, she said the farmers situation is very serious. We dont want to hear about schemes in your reply. Tell me what relief you can give to our farmers. We want full loan waiver.Prabhat Jha (BJP) rejected allegation that the government was insensitive towards farmers plight and said maximum decisions had been taken over the last three years in the interest of farmers.He listed a slew of measures underaken like raising minimum support price for agriculture produce like wheat, rice, pulses and oilseeds.He said it was due to initiatives of the government that there was a record production of foodgrains in the country in 2016-17 at 271.98 million tonne (MT) including 108.8 MT rice and 96.64 MT of wheat besides 22.14 MT of pulses and 33.60 MT of oilseeds.On police firing during farmers agitation in Madhya Pradesh recently, Jha asked the opposition not to link such incidents to politics.He reminded the Congress that 24 farmers had been killed in firing in Madhya Pradesh in 1998 when Digvijay Singh was the Chief Minister and said nobody linked it to politics.D Raja of CPI said the whole country is witnessing suffering of farmers and asked the central government to consider debt waiver which has been done by various states.Farmers committing suicides should be unacceptable to us, Raja said and questioned why various commission reports on agriculture were not being implemented by the government.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

In addition, the NGO claimed, ghee, coconut, cashew and raisins were of poor quality.The NGO sampled 1,143 food items in the May-June period, and found 983 samples adulterated. Whats worse salt used for preparing food didnt contain iodine, said an NGO official.The findings found an overall adulteration of 86% of the total samples collected for tests. Eighty-one percent of salt samples did not have iodine. Mustard oil and vermillion were found adulterated. Some common items used to cook noodles such as chilli sauce, tomato sauce and vinegar were found unfit for consumption.Not only food, even prasad offered to the deities is of poor quality. Consumption of the food served to the people on yatra could mean a serious threat to life. Salt, an important ingredient was, found without iodine...which is dangerous, SPECS secretary Brijmohan Sharma said at a conference after releasing the findings on Wednesday.In the first 10 days, 2.21 lakh pilgrims paid obeisance at Badrinath and Kedarnath. Some 15 lakh pilgrims visited the four shrines within two months after the pilgrimage season began on April 27.Food Safety and Standards Authority (FSSA) additional commissioner Pankaj Pandey rejected the findings of the NGO. If the findings are genuine, then why dont they share statistics with the government? We dont claim that there is no adulteration along the route, but the report is exaggerated, he told Hindustan Times.Secretary, tourism, R Meenakshi Sundaram came out in support of Pandey. I cant say whether the report is correct or not, but it brings a bad name to the state. If the NGO is so concerned of adulteration, then why doesnt it reach out to the authority?Sharma was clueless whether the report was to be shared with FSSA officials. He told Hindustan Times that the previous reports were submitted to former chief minister Harish Rawat, who forwarded the findings to the department concerned.

The price is expected to further go up in the next couple of weeks, even touching Rs. 100 in the open market.During the last one week, the arrivals to the market remained fluctuating, but tending to be on the downward side. On Tuesday, the market received stocks to the tune of 293 metric tonnes, while it was 317 MT on Monday. In July 2016, the arrival was registered at 600 tonnes per day.Now, half of the produce with first quality grade was exported to Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and New Delhi. The second variety was sold in the wholesale at Rs. 41 per kg, which in turn was priced at Rs. 60-80 in the regular vegetable markets. The price is expected to go up in the next couple of weeks, even touching Rs. 100 in the open market.Farmers at the Madanapalle market had thrown away the produce in hundreds of tonnes daily when the price suddenly fell to Rs. 1 per kg in June 2015. Two years since the event, they have reason to smile. About 10,000 farmers depend on tomato crop in the western mandals, covering an acreage of about 30,000 hectares.Deputy Director (Horticulture) Saraswathi told The Hindu that in February harvesting of the major part of the crop was done and there was a slump in the later months.The crop suffered substantial damage in April and May due to sudden rains in the western mandals. Though tomato farming is done in Madanapalle division throughout the year, this year, there prevailed a gap between February and June, the official said. Agriculture Market Committee (AMC-Madanapalle) chairman Ratakonda Gurappa Naidu, an authority on tomato trading in the region since three decades, said for the first time the farmers were educated about the need for sustained farming, covering round the year. In the previous seasons, a farmer used to go in for tomato crop all over the field simultaneously. This used to result in bumper crop, resulting in no demand and plummeting prices. This crop year, the farmers divided the crop pattern into three categories.Each farmer maintained three slots of farming, avoiding bumper crops. The even distribution has led to a drastic fall in production, but it protected the economic interests of the farmers with healthy demand and moderate supply.Another reason for happiness of the domestic farmer here is that tomato growing has been halted in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh with the advent of summer, facilitating our farmers to export their produce to northern parts, Mr. Naidu said.Meanwhile, the retail prices at the vegetable markets became a cause of big worry to the households. In Chittoor, the second quality produce was sold at Rs. 70-80 on Tuesday, and it was the same throughout the district. In Srikalahasti, the supply was truncated, and the households virtually went hunting for the red gold."

A week before, tomatoes were priced at Rs. 36 and chillies at Rs. 26 a kg.Attributing the surge in prices of vegetables to unfavourable climatic condition and frequent showers, farmers say the annual harvest has been adversely affected. This year, rain washed away most part of tomato crop cultivated on a two-acre field in my farm in Sabbavaram mandal. Normally, the seasonal crop fetches good margins but this time I have to grapple with the failed harvest, rues P. Appala Naidu, tomato-grower.While tomato producers from Ramabhadrapuram, Sabbavaram, K. Kotapadu and Pendurthi mandals bear the brunt of the crop failure, wholesale traders cite short supply from vegetable-growing regions as reason for increase in tomato price. The supply from main tomato-growing regions such as Kolar, Narayangaon, Bengaluru, Guntur, Anantapur and Madanapalle has come down drastically. With a huge variation between the demand and supply, the prices of tomatoes have eventually increased, A. Narayana Murthy, wholesale trader, says.Rythu bazaars in MVP Colony, Seethammadhara and Gopalapatnam receive about 50 to 80 quintals of tomatoes a day, whereas the ones at Narasimha Nagar, Kancharapalem, Peda Waltair and Madhurawada get 20-40 quintals.In addition to tomatoes and green chillies, prices of leafy vegetables have almost doubled in the past 10 days. A small bunch of coriander leaves costs Rs. .10-Rs. 20.According to estate officer of MVP Rythu Bazaar K.

A scene from the Ernakulam market on Tuesday.Thulasi KakkatThere seems to be no respite to the common man as vegetable prices in the district continue to remain largely high, with tomato, onion and carrot being especially costly.At the Ernakulam market, small onion was sold at a wholesale price of Rs. 90 per kg and a retail price of Rs. 100 whereas tomato and carrot were sold at Rs. 52 and Rs. 60 and Rs. 55 and Rs. 60 respectively. Prices were even higher in some other markets.On an average, vegetable prices continue to be 20 per higher than what it was a month ago, though prices of some vegetables have dropped slightly, said K.K. Ashraf, vice-president, Ernakulam Market Stall Owners Association.Price of shallotsThe only relief seems to be the declining trend in the price of shallots after touching a high of Rs. 130 recently, though the ruling retail price of Rs. 100 per kg is a far cry from Rs. 65 in April. Mr. Ashraf expressed the hope that a further softening of onion prices would come about with production catching up in Tamil Nadu, the main supplier to Kerala.However, tomato and carrot prices continued to hold firm with the previous low of Rs. 20 per kg appearing to be from a distant past. Green chilli has also turned a lot spicier with the price soaring to Rs. 60 per kg from Rs. 35.The shortage of tomatoes in North India drove traders from there to the markets in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which in turn, took a toll on the supply to Kerala. The strike by farmers in Maharashtra didnt help either, Mr. Ashraf said.In the meantime, the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) which aims at ensuring fair prices for farmers, was on a high over what it claimed consistently good returns for farmers. Farmers continue to auction their crops through 22 farmer markets in the district.Data collected from the wholesale markets in Aluva, Ernakulam and Perumbavoor on a daily basis by the market information centre of the VFPRCK were handed over to farmers to be used as the base price in auctioning their produce.This ensured that farmers got a price, which was even better than the market price, a senior VFPCK official said.Asked whether better price for farmers automatically resulted in higher prices for consumers, the official said that it was beyond the mandate of the VFPCK and had to be addressed by the government through market intervention measures."

The subsequent onion bumper crop dragged its price to Rs 2 a kilogram, forcing many farmers to let their produce rot in the fields.We have noticed that whenever farmers have perishable items with them, the prices are in the dumps, and the moment it goes into the hands of traders, there is a massive price spike, says Bhupendra Patidar, a farmer from Barbariya village in Neemuch district.Six farmers were killed in clashes with police in the Neemuch-Mandsaur region in the first week of June, leading to protests across the state and a demand for government assured minimum price at local markets. The protests forced the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government to procure onions at Rs 8 per kg.Two months down the line, when the farmers have nothing to sell and are busy sowing for the next season, the prices of most agriculture products have shot up.In May, the average price of tomatoes in Mandsaurs wholesale market was Rs 500-700 per quintal. In August first week, it touched Rs 4,500. Similarly, the price of onions almost doubled from Rs 400 to Rs 800 per quintal during the same period.Skyrocketing prices Average price of onion and tomato has been witnessing a sharp spike across the country over past few months Average price of onion and tomato has been witnessing a sharp spike across the country over past few monthsWith local traders adding their profit margin, tomatoes are retailing at Rs 100 or more per kg in most parts of the country. The retail price of onion has crossed Rs 30 per kg, with a further spike expected till the fresh produce lands in September.Small and marginal farmers who constitute 85% of the farming community rarely get the benefit of high prices. The reason being they dont have storage facilities to take benefit of the price fluctuation, says Patidar, who witnessed the dumping of unsold onions and tomatoes by the roadside this year.After last years losses, like most farmers, we did not grow tomatoes this season. But now the prices are sky high and only the traders have it, says Jaswant Carpenter of Pipliyamandi, the epicentre of the farmers protest in Mandsaur.Traders, however, blame low production for tomato prices sky-rocketing.There is less production this year and therefore low supply. Most of it is in the hands of the big traders who are releasing it slowly from the cold storage so that the prices do not come down, says a government official in Indore, not wanting to be named.Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh president Shiv Kumar Sharma blames the government for the price fluctuations. In the last 14 years, the government has failed to increase storage capacity for onions or tomatoes as a result of which vegetables rot during bumper production and only traders benefit by hoarding it.Given the current spate of rains and floods, traders see no relief in sight due to supply disruption which is likely to continue till August-end. In fact, prices of other vegetables such as brinjal and cabbage will also rise due to reduced supply as the summer vegetable season comes to an end.(With inputs from Mustafa Hussain)"

The heat and lack of water have led to a fall in production. If the market received 10 loads earlier, now it gets two-three loads a day, he says.Tomato prices in Chala vary from Rs. 60 to Rs. 70 a kg when it normally costs Rs. 20 a kg or less.A 28-kg box of tomatoes cost Rs. 1,600, says an employee at a wholesale dealer in the market. Factoring in loss owing to spoilage, tomatoes have to be sold at Rs. 65 a kg, he says.However, a retailer at Sreevarahom says he buys tomatoes at Rs. 1,400 a box.A vegetable seller at Vallakadavu says he purchases tomatoes from Chala at Rs. 60 a kg and sells them at Rs. 70 a kg. A box that usually costs up to Rs. 500 a kg cost me Rs. 1,400 today. On Monday, it was Rs. 1,300 a box.It is not just tomatoes that have homamakers groaning. The price of ladys finger too has shot up to Rs. 60-65 a kg from Rs. 22-30 a kg.Retailers say they cant increase the price of tomatoes beyond a point as stock will go unsold, and tomatoes get spoilt fast. People know what the price in Chala is. I can sell tomatoes only if the increase is reasonable. Ladys finger can be sold for Rs. 80 a kg but not tomatoes, says a retailer.If stock remains unsold, they purchase less from Chala the next day.Carrot and beans continue to be expensive. While the wholesale price of carrot is Rs. 70 in Chala, a retailer says his selling price for carrot and beans is Rs. 100 a kg. Another retailer sells carrot at Rs. 80 a kg, and beans at Rs. 70.Drumstick too is costlier  from Rs. 25 a kg, its price has gone up to Rs. 60 in the past three-four days.

The price has skyrocketed compared to last week, making it one of the costliest vegetables this week.According to traders, the steep rise in the price is due to decline in supply to the market in the city. The increase in price of this staple vegetable is making purchase of vegetables an expensive exercise.As A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam, explained, There is no production of tomatoes in Tamil Nadu as of now, and we are relying only on supply from Andhra Pradesh. As tomatoes are being supplied from AP to all places, the supply is dwindling, resulting in the rise in rates.On Tuesday, a kg of tomato was priced between Rs. Rs. 50 and Rs. 60 in the retail market, but each shop fixed its own rate. The price has been steadily rising in the last 10 days by Rs. five to Rs. 10. Last week, the price of one kg of tomato was between Rs. 30 and Rs. 40, he said.Last month, tomatoes were sold at Rs. 15 to Rs. 20 a kg, he added. A retail vendor in Sathuvachari said the rates had shot up especially in the last three or four days. A box of tomatoes comprising 25 kg was earlier priced at Rs. 600. Now, it costs between Rs. 1,300 and Rs. 1,400.Brinjal too is costlyAnother vegetable that has turned pricier is the thorny variety of brinjal. The rates have almost doubled when compared to a few weeks ago. A kilogram of brinjal costs between Rs. 60 and Rs. 80 now. There is no water for crops, and there is also pest attack due to heat conditions. Hence, the yield is less, Mr. Balu added."

There is no definite cause for the increase, with middlemen at Vashi APMC blaming ambiguous causesfrom November's demonetisation to the farmers' strike in June as well as ""inclement weather"".Contrary to traders' claims there is no visible shortage either. Good quality, robust red tomatoes are available at all markets in Mumbai. Curiously, retail rates are rising even as wholesale rates continue to fall.APMC trader Shyam Yadav said, ""Wholesale rates rose to Rs 55-60 per kg over Friday-Saturday. On Monday, they dropped to Rs 36-40. Let us see what happens tomorrow.""Conversely, retail rates were Rs 35-40 per kg over Friday-Saturday, perhaps due to leftover stocks, which spiralled to Rs 60-80 Monday as retailers charged their pound of flesh. ""I bought half a kilo for Rs 30 to tide over the next two days. But how long can we continue like this?"" said Andheri resident Shaila Grover.Tomato is a household staple without which no meal is complete. Moreover, Shravan observances are set to begin on July 10 for north Indian communities and July 24 for Maharashtrians and Gujaratis. During this time families avoid onion and garlic and rely on tomato.One of the largest middlemen in the tomato trade at APMC Vashi, Javed Memon, cited a slew of reasons which seemed tough to swallow. ""This price increase is an outcome of notebandi. Recently there was also the farmers' strike in Maharashtra. Moreover, I am told the seeds have failed in south India. So this season we are relying on tomatoes from Maharashtra where a heat wave has beset certain growing areas. Also, remember that farmers have not been getting a good rate for their produce since the past year and a half. It is time they made some money.""Asked when customers would get relief, Memon said, ""Don't think of customers. Why think of customers alone, think of the farmer as well."" TOI asked if farmers were getting good rates at present. ""Well, not to their satisfaction. After all, the quality of their tomatoes is poor,"" the middleman said, adding prices would remain high till end-August.Mumbai receives its quota of tomato from cultivated areas in Karnataka, as well as Satara, Sangli and Narayangaon in Pune."

In case of tomato, the price has jumped to Rs 21 per kg from Rs 9 per kg two weeks ago.The local traders said, usually as the rain starts the supply of vegetables is affected; but, after two to three weeks of monsoon, harvesting of vegetables increases. Small farmers said some vegetables get them good price. But they fear the prices may come down as the harvesting starts.Shankar Chavan, a farmer and vegetable vendor at Kapiltirth Market, said, ""The farmers come from long distances. Since the transport services get slowed down during heavy rains, which are occurring in most parts of the district, the supply of vegetables comes down. For instance, the demand for green chillies is comparatively less now, but the prices have gone up from Rs 60 per kg to Rs 80 per kg.""The traders at the APMC here said the heavy rains in villages damage the harvested produce. A couple of weeks ago, the supply of tomatoes was around 2,000 crates every day; but, it came down to 700 crates on Monday. The retail prices of tomatoes, one of the most perishable produces, rose to Rs 21 per kg in from Rs 9 per kg a couple of weeks ago.The district is not self-sufficient as far as vegetables are concerned as the area under vegetable cultivation is small.

Prices of almost all fresh vegetables, barring onion and potato, have increased by over 100%.Sameer Singh, a software profession, was surprised when confronted by the hike in vegetable prices. ""I had last purchased vegetables last Sunday (June 25), when prices were stable. But today, I was taken aback by vegetable prices, which have shot up by over 100%.

""We were eating lots of salad for the past few months. But with prices of cucumber, tomato and coriander rising significantly, we had to remove salad from our menu,"" said homemaker Yadav.According to traders, prices rose mainly due to contraction in supply of vegetables after the rains. Inderjeet Thakran, president of Khandsa Market Association, said, ""Supply has reduced by 40% in a week, leading to increase in prices.""""Across north India, most agricultural fields are submerged,"" said Thakran, adding prices rise every year after rains, and are expected to settle down in 2-3 weeks. ""Prices are expected to fall by this month-end. You will see correction in prices of some of the vegetables later this week itself,"" he said.He added that tomato, which had remained relatively cheap so far due to local supply, will remain costly for some time, even as prices of other vegetables come down.""Local tomato supply has ended.

""But currently there is no plan to upgrade the list or include vegetables in this list,"" Singh said.When told that farmers in Gujarat were throwing their produce away because of low support prices, Singh said that they should use cold storage facilities.Speaking at the seminar on 'Productivity and Product Diversification Challenges for Natural Fibres,' Singh said that natural fibres are the backbone of Indian textile industry. He said that despite stiff competition from synthetic fibres, the demand for natural fibres was steadily increasing with a growing population.The minister further said that given the limitation in increasing area under cultivation, the only way to improve production is increasing productivity. He said that introduction of high-yielding varieties, best agronomical practices, efficient fibre extractors and effective utilization for diversified products will improve productivity. Cotton is produced in over 90 countries across the world, and over 60% of that production comes from India, Singh said.Union textile minister Smriti Irani said the textile ministry and agriculture ministry have decided that the two ministries will have a regular exchange of information, knowledge and feedback on best practices .

They have also cited less buying by retailers during rainy season as another reason for supply shortage in local markets.In retail markets , increase in average prices is ranging between Rs 10 and Rs 15 per kg. So far, the worst hit has been tomato which has seen a decline in supply and a sharp rise in prices. During the past fortnight, tomato price has increased by around Rs 15 per kg.

Tomato prices have actually shown a sharp rise across the country in the past 10 days following crop damage due to rain in tomato-producing states like Haryana.""We receive the bulk of tomato from Maharashtra. But supplies have gone down substantially in the past few weeks. This has created a supply shortage in the wholesale market.

The farmers sold potatoes for as low as nine paisa per kg in Kurukshetra and were forced to feed tomatoes to their cattle as they did not get the right price, he said.The former CM said both the farmers and the consumers had suffered as the fall in prices of agricultural products had not reflected in the prices of the end-products.He said the prices of wheat, potatoes and tomatoes had nose-dived, but there was no change in the prices of flour, chips and the sauce, adding that the farmer was silent but not dumb."

Basavarajus produce was bought by a trader from Kerala. He described the price as highest in this season.Basavaraju attributed the sudden rise in the cost caused by a fall in production to declining water reserves (short-duration crops not getting sufficient water) and the demand for the fruit in neighbouring States, mainly from Kerala and Tamil Nadu.Basavaraju, who had grown tomatoes on a small portion of his land at Kalkunda, had so far harvested 200 crates and expects 50 more crates in the next few days. I go to markets where I get a good price. I have also sold tomato in Bengaluru and Hassan markets, said the farmer, who also grows vegetables on his 7-acre plot.Like Basavaraju, tomato growers, who had brought their produce to the APMC here, said they had grown the fruit with borewell water. The three-month crop needs water intermittently and the groundwater source had not improved with rains playing truant, they said.Stability unlikelyUntil May, tomato was available at Rs. 15-Rs. 20 a kg.

According to an official, traders from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are purchasing the product in Karnataka.In May, tomato cultivators in Kolar were dumping their crop by the roadside as prices had crashed to as low as Rs. 2 a kg in the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) yard. This month, however, the tide has turned. Rates have doubled and, in some cases, increased four times since June. Kolar district is one of the biggest producers of tomato in Karnataka.The reason for this change in narrative is a massive loss of the crop in some of the major tomato growing States in the country.Huge damage to crops, particularly in Nashik in Maharashtra, is the main reason for increase in demand from Kolar. Plus, damage to crop due to diseases and pests in non-traditional areas such as Mandya has added to the scarcity, said M.S. Raju, Deputy Director, Horticulture Department.According to A. Vishwanath, an APMC official, traders from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are purchasing the product in Karnataka. Another APMC source said that there has been interest even from Punjab. On June 4, a quintal was being sold at the APMC for a minimum of Rs. 314 and a maximum of Rs. 1,400 depending on quality and variety. On July 4, the price range was from Rs. 667 to Rs. 5,334 a quintal. On Wednesday morning, the average rate was around Rs. 5,000.In the retail market, consumers were paying Rs. 10 per kg a month ago. Now, they have to shell out as much as Rs. 50.Search for alternativesA reduction in supply from other States and districts combined with the produce from Kolar being shipped out of Karnataka has led to a scarcity and a steep hike in prices in the local market.This has led to experimenting with other local products.

Fall in production in neighbouring States owing to climatic factors has led to an increase in prices of many vegetables.Tomato and okra are among the vegetables that have shown a significant increase in recent days. In Chala, tomato costs between Rs. 60 to Rs. 70 a kg, but retail prices elsewhere in the city go up to Rs. 80 a kg.Shallots continue to make homemakers shed tears, with prices ranging from Rs. 80 a kg for wholesale to Rs. 140 in retail shops for the best quality.SeasonalSays a commission agent at Chala: Prices are on the rise owing to a drop in production. This is seasonal. Take onion for instance. As onion prices are low in producer States following bumper production, not many farmers will be inclined to grow onion. Those who do will get a good price next year as prices will increase when supply dwindles. This is also the case with shallots. With less stock availability, prices are bound to shoot up. However, there has been a dip in wholesale prices of shallots, he points out. Though shallots havent been reaching the market from Tamil Nadu, an improvement in climate in the crop-growing areas in Karnataka holds out some hope for a further reduction in prices.Yet there are vegetables such as thadiyan kaya which cost Rs. 35 a kg now. I dont remember it exceeding Rs. 20 a kg in recent times, he says.Another wholesale agent says that following a shortfall in tomato production in some States, traders from there reached Karnataka markets, affecting the supply to Kerala. The prices have shot up this much within a fortnight, says a retail vegetable seller.While cowpea (payar) is available for Rs. 40 a kg at Chala, the nadan variety costs Rs. 90-100.Green chilli has not lost its bite either, with prices hovering around Rs. 60 a kg for wholesale and Rs. 70 for retail.Carrot cost around Rs. 60, though cheaper ones can be had for Rs. 45 a kg, says an agent for a farmers producer company. There are three to four types of carrots and beans available, and prices vary for each. Carrot, from Rs. 54 the day before, has increased to Rs. 62. Beans is priced at Rs. 62.Daily fluctuations too have a role to play, and over the course of a week, prices may show a substantial increase or decrease. For instance, okra that cost Rs. 57 a kg a week ago has dipped to Rs. 36 for wholesale and Rs. 40 for retail. Drumstick price too has come down to Rs. 50 a kg. Indian cucumber though is expensive.One retailer at Chala says good quality carrots are available for less than Rs. 50 a kg. But okra in his shop costs Rs. 50 a kg, though it used to cost less than Rs. 20 a kg a month ago.QualityA couple of retailers say they stock the best quality and hence prices are on the higher side for their veggies. Yet, this argument does not go down well with customers who complain of being fleeced.Price intervention, however, does not work much, say the traders.Prices of vegetables that are expensive now will come down in a month or so, some say. Yet others think the trend will continue till Chingam."

Over watering can rot the plantJoin social media groups on organic terrace gardening for expert helpOf late Bengalureans have taken the saying 'Grow what you eat, Eat what you grow' quite seriously. Many in the city are now growing their own veggies and fruits in the tiniest space they find and do not shy from showing off their bounty. However, in this growing group of organic terrace gardeners, there are youngsters who manage to strike a balance between their studies and their hobby.For 14-year-old Niranjan Girish, it was his grandmother who inspired him to take to gardening. Niranjan says, ""When I was young, I used to go to Chennai to visit my grandmother and I used to see her work in her garden. She used to grow several vegetables. That is when I began helping her out and grew a fondness for gardening."" The ninth grader's vegetable garden in his house boasts of pomogranate, brinjal, strawberry, orange, potato, carrots and several other plants. Sixteen-year-old Arya Pudota too began growing vegetables and fruits at a young age. Arya, who has been actively involved in organic kitchen gardening, took after his mother, who had brought a piece of land next to their home with the intention of having a kitchen garden. He now grows several vegetables such as coriander, spinach, ladyfingers, beans, tomatoes, brinjal and more, most of which are consumed at home, he says adding that the family tries to limit their vegetable and fruit purchase from the market to a bare minimum.Having a garden in the city is a tough task, given the space crunch. But these gardeners have managed to have their own green patch by utilizing every little space they get. Apart from the space, sourcing seeds and saplings has been a worry for them. Kiran Pattar, another young terrace gardener and an entrepreneur from the city says that initially, even he had problems while sourcing seeds. ""I have been growing vegetables and fruits since I was a kid. Back in those days sourcing seeds was a problem. I had to go and approach farmers for saplings or seeds,"" he says adding that now things are better, given that several ecommerce companies sell all the gardening necessities.Though there haven't been any problems, sometimes the yield is not as expected, says Arya. ""We realized that once our vegetables were not growing as they were supposed to. So we took the help of an expert, who said that there was zinc deficiency in the soil. Following that, we added organic supplements in the soil,"" he says.Arya, who has conducted sapling drives in the past, says that he has received immense support from his school. ""I have also created the first recreational garden and given away saplings to teachers as part of gardening drives in my school and try to ensure that there are regular activities conducted that encourage students to take part in gardening,"" he says. In addition to this, schools in the city are now introducing gardening as part of the curriculum, encouraging students to take up organic gardening. BM English School on Hennur- Bagalur Road, is one such school that has introduced gardening as one of the subjects from first grade. ""We have introduced gardening from first grade onwards where each class is given a soil bed where they can grow their own vegetables. In addition to this, they are also taught waste management and composting. From sixth grade onwards, the classes are given a bigger patch of land,"" says S Rajesh, Principal, BM English School.How comfortable are the parents with the inclusion of such a subject in the syllabus, we ask. ""Initially we were skeptical of introducing gardening as a subject as parents would think that it would eat into their regular subjects, but after they saw how beneficial it would be for their kids, they supported us in this initiative,"" he says adding that now the students don't mind getting their hands dirty in mud.Kiran adds that in addition to the parents, schools must also encourage students to take up organic terrace gardening. ""If schools introduce it in their curriculum, it will be easier for the parents to understand and support their children in this initiative,"" he says stressing that people should start organic gardening not because it is a trend but to make it a part of their lifestyle."

The supply of tomatoes from Karnataka to Yemmiganur in Kurnool district has nosedived.The short supply, thanks to decreased rainfall, resulted in the escalation of price by 150 per cent  `100 per kg  in Kurnool. V Hanumantha Rao Chowdary, a wholesaler dealer in the main market of the district head quarters, said there was a sharp fall in sales. The cost of vegetables has gone up, particularly that of tomatoes. This has resulted in a decrease in the number of buyers, with even regular customers reducing their consumption.

The going rate of tomatoes in Vijayawada is now `55/kg, a steep rise compared to last month's `20/kg. Officials pin the blame on the decrease in production.

The programme, under National Horticulture Mission, is aimed at expanding the coverage to 11,250 acres in 22 districts, including Cauvery delta region that is reeling under a water crisis.Making a suo motu announcement under Rule 110, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami said the move was to avail less quantum of water and give high yield to generate more income for farmers. ""In the current fiscal year, the plan is to help 2,250 farmers. Hybrid seeds and raised seedlings will be distributed to farmers at a 50% subsidy of Rs 8,000 per acre,"" he said. Other than the traditional western belt of horticulture like Krishnagiri and Ariyalur, the government plans to bring in more areas under the scheme to benefit the larger population.While Tamil Nadu produces 77.72 lakh metric tonnes of vegetables annually, the area under vegetable cultivation will be increased to 3.37 lakh hectares from the present 3.14 lakh hectares. Hybrid vegetable cultivation is promoted by providing assistance to cultivation, and the special focus is given to preserve traditional vegetables. ""Predominantly, tomatoes, brinjal, and chillies are the major crop seedlings given to farmers. We motivate them to expand the areas by availing the subsidized seedlings,"" said a senior government official. Hybrid vegetable protray seedlings are raised in state horticulture farmers.Palaniswami announced a scheme to promote solar energy in agriculture. At least 1,000 farmers will get fixed type solar powered pumping systems with 90% subsidy assistance from the state and Centre. ""This comes in the wake of huge demand from the farmers, especially in the delta region. The pump sets come in the range of 5HP to 10HP and the programme is being implemented successfully for the last four years,"" the official said. Only 203 solar powered pump sets were extended to the farmers last year, with 80% subsidy.The state has also planned to set up 597 'pack' houses to add value to the horticulture produce in districts. Similarly, 160 sub-agricultural extension centres will be built, in addition to 146 centres coming up in block level to help farmers get the services of agriculture department, including seeds and micro-nutrients.The chief minister said the Centre of Excellence for Bio-Technology will be established in the Tamil Nadu Agriculture University in Coimbatore at an estimated cost of Rs 430 crore, with the preliminary sanction of Rs 51 crore this fiscal year. Adequate infrastructure facilities will be provided in agriculture institutions across the state at a cost of Rs 108 crore."

For, after sliding down from as high as Rs 70 per kg in the beginning of July, tomatoes are back to turning people red with anger at having to shell out anywhere between Rs 70 and Rs 100 per kg.One kg of tomatoes, which was priced at Rs 38 in the state-run Rythu Bazaar last Tuesday, was back to reigning at Rs 70 per kg this Tuesday.Confirming that prices have been spiraling out of control, the state agriculture department authorities said that it is highly unlikely that the situation will improve anytime soon because of a shortfall in tomato cultivation in the state.Explaining the reason for fluctuating prices, B Babu, an officer of the department, said that after the initial price rise in the beginning of July (as heavy rainfall left standing crop damaged), the authorities began importing tomatoes from neighbouring states, bringing down prices for a while.""Farmers in the state did not take up vegetable farming completely . If they had one acre of land, they only planted vegetables on one-fourth of it,"" said Babu, adding that only 65 % of the total area under vegetable cultivation in the state was planted this year.Farmers are reportedly taking up partial planting to avoid facing losses due to na tural reasons, like last year's flooding or the drought-like situation that was prevalent over the state in the couple of years before that.""Farmers say that they are not able to make any profits as their produce is being taken away by middle-men, who take the produce into the city markets. If this is the case, there is bound to be gaps in the demand and supply of vegetables in the city,"" said Naveen Ramsetty, state committee member, Rythu Swarajya Vedika.The city, he said, procures nearly 90% of its vegetables from two places, Kurnool and Madanapally village in Chittoor district."

Prices may increase as demand rises.Prices of several other vegetables have touched Rs 100 per kg or are nearing that mark.Brinjal's price has crossed Rs 50 per kg. Prices of ladyfingers, cluster beans, and green beans have gone past the Rs 50 per kg threshold in the retail market.""Prices of vegetables are skyrocketing because of heavy rains in the city,"" said Deepak Patel, the secretary of the APMC. ""Whenever there is a long spell of rain in the state, prices increase.""He said that prices usually stabilize when water recedes from fields.He said that the state was banking on tomatoes from Maharashtra and the south because rain has washed away around 25% of crops. But steady demand was increasing prices, he said.Sources in the APMC said that the demand for the tomatoes will increase as the shravan month begins in a week for North Indians, and by the end of the month for Gujaratis and Maharashtrians. During shravan, people avoid onion and garlic and hence the demand for tomatoes and other vegetables shoots up.It is worth recalling that farmers in the state did not receive good prices for their produce earlier this year; they were forced to throw away the produce on the roads. However, Radheshyam Marwadi, a trader in Memnagar , said that prices are likely to dip later this month. But they will increase again in August and September."

For ages, the Nepali-speaking population in the Hills have relied on a unique ""exchange plan"" of sorts to tide over tough times  when in need, people don't hesitate to approach their neighbours for cereals or flour, only to return the exact quantities when things improve. Now, they have moved a step ahead and turned to barter.Biju Rai, who runs a stationery shop near the old TV station in Darjeeling, had stacked four crates of biscuits along with other items two days before the strike. When the shutdown began, he had ample resources but hardly any vegetables or cash.""Biscuits have become extremely prized in these circumstances. So, I have started trading the biscuit packets for vegetables like tomatoes, watercress and pumpkin from a local vegetable seller, who grows vegetables in her own farm,"" Rai said.Another stationary shop owner in Chawkbazar, who requested anonymity, said locals regularly knock on his doors after dusk  his home is adjacent to the shop  to ask for daily requirements like salt, sugar and flour.""Over the past two days, people have started running short of cash. Yesterday, I gave away a kg of salt and sugar each to a local for four apples and six bananas. I think I made a good deal since fruits have disappeared from the market,"" he said.A woman who continues to sell momos, thukpas and homemade breadsticks near the Darjeeling Sadar Hospital as her establishment is out of the purview of the strike as she caters to patients and their relatives, said how an elderly woman came to her with an ailing grandson and little money to pay and offered her some beans, green chillies and bitter-gourd grown in her kitchen garden. ""I didn't take the vegetables though and told her to pay later for the food,"" she said.Liquor outlets in the Hills were shut down by the administration well before the indefinite bandh started as officials felt liquor could be used as a bait by Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) leaders to mobilise mobs. But the locals have found a way to procure liquor bottles from Sikkim or the plains and these are selling at a premium.""I had stacked a few bottles of liquor last week but had to trade a bottle of Old Monk rum for five litres of petrol from a pump owner who had no liquor stock. He has promised me more fuel if I can continue to supply liquor,"" said Prakash Thapa, who ran out of fuel for his bike.A regular face at the motor stand in Darjeeling, Ratna Maan, who sells milk and watercress said he is accepting nutrition bars and chocolates from those who don't have cash. ""I have brothers at home, who love chocolates and nutrition bars. Since, they are hard to find now, I accept them,"" he said.GJM leaders said they are aware of the barter system and called it a form of ""improvisation"" on the part of residents. ""Hills people are always ready to improvise. They are helping each other by exchanging goods of daily use. But they are also determined to continue with the strike and endure sufferings to attain the larger goal - Gorkhaland,"" said Kalyan Dewan, a senior GJM leader and convenor of Gorkhaland Movement Coordination Committee."

This staple item is selling for Rs 70-80 in most parts of the city as well as Thane and Navi Mumbai.Citizens have been tweeting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to take action. The holy month of Shravan began in north India on Monday. The fasting season according to the Maharashtrian and Gujarati calendar starts July 24. As families abstain from non-vegetarian food during this time, consumption of tomato rises.Traders have no explanation for the increase other than ""unseasonal rain"". They say the situation will continue through August. This is bewildering given that farmers were dumping produce in the streets as tomato rates crashed to Re 1 per kg a few weeks ago.In Andheri market, vendor Umar said, ""We are selling good quality fruit for Rs 100 because we are purchasing for Rs 75 in the wholesale market. This stock comes from Bangalore. The crop in Maharashtra has failed due to excessive rain."" Last week, the largest trader in APMC had cited a slew of reasons including ""demonetisation, farmers' strike and bad weather"".On Monday, buyers in Thane market, Bandra and Andheri restricted themselves to purchasing half a kg. Others chose to avoid tomato. ""The greengrocer cheekily asked me why I did not want to buy tomato since I had bought other vegetables. I retorted that at Rs 80 per kg, he was welcome to keep his produce,"" said Shiuli Banerjee of Malad.Kitchens are forced to explore alternatives. Borivli housewife Rosemary Fernandes recommended that households try vinegar while Maya Mirchandani of Andheri recommended thickening the gravy with sour curd or tamarind pulp. Banerjee suggested lime juice and kokum to add sourness, and gravies thickened with potato and cornflour to tide over the crisis.Prices of onion-tomato have maintained a steady average of Rs 15-20 per kg since 2014. In previous years, the country had seen a biannual spike in rates from March-May and October-December as traders cited ""seasonal shortages"" owing to the vagaries of monsoon. This inexplicable spike has brought consumers' worst fears back to haunt them."

Tomatoes and potatoes have been dumped on roads as agitations erupt for minimum support prices or loan waivers . But in the tribal hamlets of Chhota Udepur farmers have made unprecedented gains. Charoli and custard apples are bringing prosperity as farmers break free from treacherous traders' trap after centuriesBordha (Chhota Udepur): It's a dry fruit that costs not less than Rs 800 a kg; as much as cashews or almonds. But Ramesh Rathwa, a 48-year-old farmer in the remote Manka village of Chhota Udepur, never got cash for charoli, the crunchy almond-flavoured dry fruit that he collected from the forest near his hut. For all the hard work he and his wife put in from 3am to noon, they got just few pounds of grains that would last them barely a fortnight.Like Rathwa, several generations of farmers in this tribal heartland only got grains instead of money, thanks to the centuries-old saata (barter) system imposed upon them by local traders. They perennially kept these illiterate farmers in the dark about the actual value of charoli, which is widely used to add an extra crunch to sweets like kheer, mohan thaal, and basundi.But winds of change are sweeping through these far-flung villages of Chhota Udepur, the only district where charoli grows in Gujarat. Realizing the exploitation, the forest department took it upon itself to help them earn profit through an 'alternative livelihood through resource generation programme.'""We have been exploited for centuries. But three years ago, it was the first time I got Rs 7,000 cash profit for charoli,"" says Ramesh, who built a pucca house with an extra income of Rs 10,000 every year. SK Puwar, DCF, Chhota Udepur, said: ""We not only educated farmers about the value of this dry fruit but also helped them sell the produce at better rates by tying up with Reliance Fresh and other big retailers. The profits are shared with farmers.""A decortication machine of Rs four lakh was also set up in Bordha, which has now emerged as the local hub for this dry fruit, said Dipak Tank, district coordinator of the programme.""We were taught the scientific way of plucking which gave best quality seeds. Moreover, the decortication has made the tedious process of women every easy,"" said Kamlaben Rathwa, president of 11-member self-help group (SHG) in BordhaCharoli trees are spread in 836 hectares of forest in Bordha where the seeds are stored, weighed and collected by the forest department for sale. Charoli cluster includes seven villages: Manka, Bordha, Degla, Sajuli, Gabadiya, Gathiya and Runvad with every hamlet having a special team to ensure that charoli is not plucked illegally.Navsingh Rathwa, who heads the joint forest management committee (JFMC) said, ""Earlier, farmers even mortgaged silver and gave additional interest on loan to buy manure and seeds. But this exploitation by moneylenders too has stopped, thanks to cash income from charoli.""Vadodara-based Spyron Masala Mills is the biggest buyer of charoli from Bordha with annual contract of 200 kg. It must be noted that charoli is collected only once a year.N Shrivastav, additional principal chief conservator of forest, project management unit, said, ""The biggest gain from this programme is forest conservation. Villagers themselves preserve trees as they get extra income from them."""
5a07826f9855b76bf13cab14,Darjeeling: Residents struggle for basic requirements of urban life,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/darjeeling-limited/articleshow/59602375.cms,2017-07-15,,The Times Of India,"Darjeeling has been reeling under a strike, and no one  from local residents to major hill party leaders who had called the strike  knows when it will be withdrawn. The strike has been going on for about a month, but even in the midst the complete shutdown, with no transport, closed shops, banks and ATMs, no internet and not a single tourist, life goes on. How are residents making do without the basic requirements of urban life?FoodAlmost every family in the Hills town stocks up on rations for the entire month at a time. Now, with stocks drying up, several residents have been knocking against downed shutters and buying grain, oil and other essentials at black-market rates. Thankfully, milk is still available in abundance as it has been brought under emergency services like medicines and LPG. But that is about it. As the days roll on, people are forced to subsist on watercress plants and homemade vegetables sold on black from behind car boots or shopkeeper's homes. At dusk, the usual sight is of people walking with battery-run torches on unlit streets, knocking on every downed store shutter in quest of some food, even at a premium. ""We had stocks for close to a month and somehow managed, but now there is a serious scarcity. Food stocks have dwindled in every home,"" says Pema Sherpa, who works as a tourist car driver.While GJM, the party that had first called the bandh, blame the cops and administration, alleging food trucks are bring stopped at Siliguri to cut off the supply to the Hills, the administration alleges that GJM supporters have been looting the trucks and taking the resources to Patlebas, where GJM is headquartered, to feed their own leaders and supporters.TransportWith bus service stalled and no shuttle tourist vehicle operating, the transport system in the Hills have now become dependent on emergency vehicles like ambulances, hearses, funeral cars, school pool cars and doctors' vehicles. Cars with 'Ambulance', 'Funeral', 'On school duty' stickers on windshields, or with a red cross, to signify it as a vehicle on ""emergency duty"" are plying within the town as well as to and from Siliguri, carrying multiple passengers, most of whom are neither sick, dead or school-goers. If the entire vehicle is taken on rent, the charge is around Rs 6,000 for a trip from Darjeeling to Siliguri. For an SUV running shuttle service, each passenger has to pay around Rs 600. ""People have to commute and they were pressuring us to take out our cars. We checked which are the vehicles exempted from the strike and decided to paste such signs and started taking passengers. We know we are taking a risk but have no other choice,"" says a driver who had pasted an ""Ambulance"" sticker on his Tata Sumo and was spotted carrying a group of locals.At least eight cars and 13 mini trucks were attacked by strike supporters, causing the death of a driver. Five NBSTC buses were also either damaged or set on fire, following which the bus service has been withdrawn.Long walksWith no transport available, people who still have to attend government offices and those on emergency duties, such as in hospitals and colleges, are forced to walk for miles. Labourers carrying two full LPG cylinders were spotted walking for over 5km uphill for delivery at households; examinees appearing for a PSC examination had walked 16km to the exam venue; and some hotel workers who were in urgent need to get down to the plains were also reported to have walked 70km in three days. ""Gorkhas by nature are never shy of hard work. So, walking a few kilometres every day is not a problem for us. It is just the incessant rain that is causing a bit of trouble in this period,"" says Vincent Pradhan , a teacher at a government college in Darjeeling, who walked 16km every day to and from his home at Ghoom while practical exams were on.EntertainmentThe indoor game of Ludo has found a new shot at life in the strike town with everyone  from cops on duty to local residents  seen engaging in the game at one time or the other, with nothing much to do for the most part of the day. Hooked on to their smartphone, a group of heads cluttered around a screen has become a common sight across every nook and corner of Darjeeling. ""What else can we do? The evenings have become dull, with all bars and pubs closed. And with no work and loads of free time, Ludo is the best time-pass,"" says tourist guide Pawan Tamang, who finds himself out of work.Among outdoor games, cricket, football and badminton are ruling the streets. However, with all shops closed, rubber or tennis balls have been replaced by strips of hard paper rolled and glued in the shape of balls, and badminton shuttlecocks have been replaced by bunched-up paper projectiles.TransactionWith ATMs and banks shut and people out of business for close to a month, almost every family is suffering from an acute shortage of cash. In this situation, the age-old barter system has made inroads back into Darjeeling  vegetables for biscuits and rice, fuel for liquor, fruits for flour, and milk for nutrition bars and chocolates. For ages, the Nepali-speaking population of the Hills have relied on a unique ""exchange plan"" of sorts to tide over tough times. When in need, people don't hesitate to approach neighbours for cereal or flour, only to return the exact quantities when things improve. Now, they have moved a step ahead and turned to barter. Biju Rai , who runs a stationery shop near the old TV station in Darjeeling, had stacked four crates of biscuits two days before the strike, along with other items. At the onset of the shutdown, he still has ample resources to last days, but no vegetables and very little cash in hand. ""Biscuits have become extremely prized in these circumstances. So, I have started trading the biscuit packets with vegetables like tomatoes, watercress and pumpkin from a local vegetable seller, who grows vegetables in her farm,"" Rai says.EducationWith all schools and colleges in the Hills shut and GJM using children, some of them as young as three-year-olds in their rallies and political programmes, the future of thousands of little ones in the Hills are in jeopardy.Schools like Himali Boarding School and St Joseph's School have all extended summer vacation and say they won't reopen until the unrest is over. Darjeeling has a number of schools that attract students from abroad as well as from other parts of the country. The ongoing turmoil has been a major cause for concern for teachers and parents. GJM had relaxed the shutdown on June 23 to let students return home. Even as most schools held classes for boarders, day-scholars missed out. They could not even take their mid-terms.GJM leaders like MLA Amar Rai, Anmol Thapa and Roshan Giri have openly claimed that students need not go to schools and should focus on the fight for Gorkhaland . ""If students miss out even one or two years because of the movement, their parents will happily agree,"" Rai has said. As a result, most students have no option but to take part in political rallies and play street games all day long.A rally here, a rally there...For Hills people, rallies and political meetings have been a part of everyday life. Now, from 10am, some party  it could be GJM, GNLF, ABGL or CPRM  takes out a rally either jointly or alone from Darjeeling station, takes a tour of the city at times through Mall Road and then congregates at Chowk Bazar. At times, they even go to the district magistrate's office or the local police station and demonstrate for some time. The crowd, comprising the same faces almost every day, is anything from 500- to 2000-strong. The rally ends with the speakers addressing the crowd from the first floor of the Chowk Bazar super market for around an hour before the crowd disperses in the afternoon. ""I attend the rallies every day as there is nothing much to do otherwise,"" a resident of Chowkbazar admits.Internet connectivitySince June 19, internet services have been in the Hills to ensure residents cannot reach out to the world or spread information through social media. But when nothing is on, the internet ban has made life even worse. A group of enterprising youths, however, have discovered a trickle of network in a pocket behind the Mahakal Temple on Mall Road, from where glimpses of north Sikkim can be caught if there is no cloud cover and rain. Since then hundreds, especially young boys and girls, have been flocking there every day with their smartphones, often under umbrellas, from dawn to midnight. People had been carrying laptops to file passport applications, transfer money, file income-tax returns online, check Facebook or simply play online games. However, for the past two days, even that connection has dwindled.""With no internet now, we practically have nothing to do. My regular routine has been to jog in the morning along different parts of the city for two hours, and on my way back, to hold my phone up and look for a feeble connection from here and there. Life without the internet is indeed one of utmost pain,"" grimaces Amit Tamang, a first-year college student.PolicingCops are now everywhere in Darjeeling, mostly in riot gear, lining the streets and route-marching every now and then but for the past one month but people no longer approach them. Since June 9, there has not been a single complaint reported at the Darjeeling Sadar police station. All the 39 complaints registered so far have been suo motu complaints by police against unidentified people or known men, mostly for vandalizing government property. ""On an average, there are around 30 complaints, mostly of petty crimes, thefts, assaults or property disputes. But since the start of the movement, there has been no complaint,"" said an officer.Hotels and touristsFor a hill station that is entirely dependent on tourists, no other section of the society has been more hurt than hoteliers and tour operators. With not a single tourist in the Hills and even Puja bookings being cancelled, hotel owners have asked their employees, mostly from the plains, to go back to their homes and return only after the strike eases. ""I have 19 employees. Keeping them means paying their salary and arranging for food. With no business and acute scarcity of food at this moment, there is no point keeping them here. I have asked all of them to go down and have promised to call them back once the situation eases,"" says a hotel owner on HD Lama Road."

So, yesterday I decided to go to the market and check it out myself. The usual guy we go to had only two kilos of tomatoes left which he was selling for `110 a kilo! When I asked him to reduce the rates, he said he doesn't have enough stock on him and thus can't lower the price.""With the rise in the prices of tomatoes, there are many who feel that it is the Goods and Services Tax (GST) that is responsible for it. Shashi Verma, a resident of central suburbs says, ""We normally go to the nearest Chembur market to do our vegetable shopping. But, two days back when we went there, tomatoes were being sold for `85-100 a kilo. When we asked the vendor about the high price, he said it was because of GST.""Adding to this, a vegetable vendor from the western suburbs says, ""We were told that it is because of the farmer's strike and GST. After the strike got over, the prices went down to `40-50 a kilo. Just before GST, they were being sold for `60 a kilo and now they've reached the maximum  `80-100 a kilo.""While the blame game is still on, a spokesperson from the APMC market in Vashi (wholesale market) feels the need to clear the air. He says, ""People should not believe in such rumours. The hike in the price is not because of GST or farmer's strike at all. It is the lack of rains this year which has to be blamed for the rise in prices. Also, most of the stock have got damaged while being brought to the city and thus most vendors had to throw them away.""Prabha Saoba a resident of Wadala says that the wholesale markets are selling tomatoes at far reasonable rates than the ones which are being sold at retail markets. She says, ""I travelled all the way to Vashi to check out the prices of tomatoes and was surprised that it was being sold for `55-60 a kilo whereas in my area, tomatoes are being sold for `100-120 a kilo.""Rakesh, a vegetable vendor at Pali Hill market in Bandra, says, ""We don't have a choice but to increase the rates of tomatoes. If we buy a kilo for `70-80, we try and sell it for `100-110, so that we can make some profit, else our business won't thrive.""While consumers don't have much choice but buy tomatoes at the rate their local vendor is offering, there are many who are offering discounts to their loyal customers. Vegetable vendor Ramesh Gupta from South Mumbai says, ""Since it isn't easy to give a discount on half a kilo of tomatoes or even less than that, we encourage our customers to shop over a kilo so that we can waive off anything between `30 or `50 on the bulk purchases.""Many took to online purchase of veggies once they got to know about the sky-high prices of tomatoes. However, they did not find solace there as well. Shraddha Vaidyanathan, a resident of Thane says, ""The day the prices shot up, my husband sat down to order tomatoes online. However, he called me up an hour later to tell me that the prices are high there too (about `86 a kilo). There was no point, so in the evening, we went to the local veggie guy and bargained with him and got a kilo of tomato for `75.Rakesh says, ""Consumers are buying on a day-to-day basis, according to their usage."" Adding to this businessman Hemant Shah says, ""If not consumed, vegetables have a high chance of rotting. Also, the tomatoes which are being sold in the market at the moment, are not in a good condition. Thus, the trouble of shopping for it on a daily basis."""

Restaurant owners, including thouse running small eateries, have been hit hard, while the prices continue to burn a hole in the pockets of the common man.The reason for the hike, some eatery owners allege, is that a mafia is controlling the prices of chicken by creating a shortage when supplies, particularly eggs from Namakkal, are regular.V J Kantharaj, owner of Mehal Biriyani on New Avadi Road in Kilpauk, said, ""There is one vernacular newspaper which decides the prices on a day-to-day basis and the shop keepers go by that, which is unfair.

This is a racket operating in the city, jacking up prices and making our lives miserable as we cannot raise the prices of food we serve.""Tomato prices too are rising due to poor supply from Mulbagal in Karnatka where heavy rain damaged the crop.

Modi gave a clarion call that India should also 'start up and stand up'.Modi says ""innovation is the biggest goal towards the route of development. Israel has always promoted innovation and technology.""The one big thing that differentiates the Indian and Israeli innovation system is way the Israelis accept failure, and failed entrepreneurs are not stigmatised.In the past, India and Israel have not looked eye-to-eye. For decades India was leaning towards Palestine and the relationship got transformed during the Kargil conflict, when Israel came to India's rescue by supplying sophisticated weapons which helped push back the Pakistani infiltrators in the Kargil zone.Since then, the relationship has grown by leaps and bounds.India launched an Israeli spy satellite, TecSAR, in 2008. India also bought a similar satellite from Israel, RISAT-2, to keep an eye on its hostile neighbours, this was cooperation at the government level.After the visit by Modi, the space agencies of the two countries can now start cooperating in earnest now.Today Israel is a power house of high technology. If India's mission to succeed as 'Start Up' country has to go forward there is a lot to learn from the original 'Start Up Nation' Israel.Many lessons need to be learnt like from seeing the working of one of the top ten most successful venture capital companies JVP, a technology powerhouse.Located in the heart of the Negev Desert where nothing grows, JVP Cyber Labs is rated one of the best. It nurtured infant ideas and in the last few years it helped create 120 companies worth USD 1.3 billion.But, what gives Israel a unique start up ecosystem?YoavTzruya, Partner at JVP Cyber Labs at Beer Sheva in Israel said, ""One of the basic cultural differences that exist in Israel as a start up nation is how we look at failure. In Israel we do not penalise failure per se. We look at the entrepreneurs, who created their companies that failed, as people who have gained from their experience.""""We have been asked by many countries around the world to replicate it, the successful model of innovation, and always culture was an obstacle. People that founded start up and failed were looked down upon. It is critical actually to embrace failure, learn from it rather than look down upon it,"" he said.Israel nurtures the start-up environment. Incubators are set up by the Israeli government, which used to give $600,000 risk free loan to promising starts ups.If companies fail they don't need to pay back the loan but if they succeed they pay back a 3 per cent annual royalty.Israel is an acknowledged world leader in the use of solar and water technology.Israel is a very dry country. Unlike India it is not blessed by the monsoons which bring bountiful rain for us. Israel may lack in rain, but the country has deployed high technology to catch every drop, even waste water is fully recycled. Today Israel is using water as a weapon of peace.Pipes are Israel's weapons of defence against perpetual water shortage. Invented in Israel, drip irrigation is the most common thing in the country.This spectacular success story has been emulated worldwide, where by drop by drop water is supplied to the roots of the plants. Every litre of water irrigates almost 10 times more area than in India.In the Middle East, it is not just oil that is inflammable, countries have gone to war over water. The lack of water is cause for constant tension but sharing technology could offer solutions.Abraham Tenne, till recently chairman, Water Development Agency said, ""Israel is a leader in water technologies. Today water is a bridge for peace and not a target for war. Israel is teaching its neighbours, Jordan and Palestine, techniques for saving water.""In Israel, it is a miracle seeing first-hand how the desert is blooming ever since Israel started using precision agriculture. Israel and India have a deep cooperation in the field of horticulture, with many farmers in Punjab and Gujarat beginning to use Israeli technology.Juicy red tomatoes, coloured bell peppers are all grown in the deserts of Israel. The sun and sand of desert is fertilised with recycled water to bring about a green revolution in the parched soils.Lior Paster, water engineer, Igudanwater for agriculture facility said, ""We collect sewage of 2.5 million people and treat it and send it to the south in good quality for agricultural use, appropriate for crops, vegetables, fruits and flowers.""Despite Israel's love for high technology, it has not permitted any genetically modified crop to be grown by its farmers.Today Israel exports fruits, vegetables and flowers to Europe from its parched landscape.Jack Gilron of Zukerbrg Institute for Water Research, SedeBoqer, said, ""Israel is very water scarce. In the last 15 years, we drought-proofed the country using enough sea water desalination to take care of two-thirds of our domestic needs. We recycle 70 per cent of our municipal waste water for agriculture.""""Between those two actions we have protected our country from drought. There are lot of companies here in Israel which are looking to collaborate with India in the area of water treatment and protecting water resources.""There are many lessons that India could learn from Israel. One big lesson being learning to accept failure as a stepping stone to success."

Prices of vegetables like gourd and lady's finger have also come down from Rs 60 per kg to Rs 35-50 per kg.According to vendors, good supply and stock of vegetables have resulted in the lowering of prices.""During these months, vegetation in plains of Punjab dips which is why vegetables have to be transported from Himachal Pradesh. Due to this, there is constant fluctuation in prices of vegetables,"" said Bittu, a wholesaler at the Sector 26 Sabzi Mandi.Ranjan Kumar, secretary of market committee, UT, Chandigarh, said, ""The fluctuation in prices is seasonal. Prices rise as vegetables like peas get transported from Lahul Spiti during this season. Once the season is over, supply will resume from Punjab which will bring down the prices. It all depends on the arrival of vegetables.""Meanwhile, buyers turned up in less numbers at the mandi on Wednesday. The constant rain since morning had led to water stagnation and mud puddles everywhere which caused trouble for buyers.

Retail price of tomatoes has risen sharply across 17 major cities and breached the Rs 90 per kg mark. There are signs that household budgets are going to be under more stress as wholesale price of onions at Lasalgaon, Maharashtra, last week hit a 19-month high at Rs 1,300 a quintal. The price of these two items serves as a barometer and recent trends are worrisome.Price spikes are not uncommon. What makes the current situation unusual is that it comes at a time of normal monsoon and soon after farmers were gutted on account of a post-demonetisation collapse in prices. A cycle where farmers and consumers are stressed by turn is a sign of fundamental problems. At the same time a birds eye view shows that fruits and vegetables are where farmers are putting more effort on the heels of changing consumption patterns. Consequently, despite two of the last four years having deficient rainfall, production has risen steadily. Even area under cultivation increased and reached 24.92 million hectares last year.Despite positive trends, if neither farmers nor consumers are satisfied, it is on account of factors under the control of policy makers and some beyond them. Sharp swings in climatic patterns have increased in the recent past, which makes agriculture a riskier proposition. Centre and states worsen this situation with an uncertain policy environment. The cumulative impact is that farmers get garbled price signals, which leads to oscillation between glut and shortage. Fixing this problem has to start with governments letting price become the primary signal for sowing, then keeping the economic environment stable for farmers.A stable environment has to be complemented with two other steps. A start has been made by linking 455 markets of 13 states through an online marketplace, with more states expected to follow. This is an important step in breaking the hold of wholesale cartels. But it needs follow up in the form of superior infrastructure. Harvest and post-harvest losses in vegetables are estimated to be upto 12.44% of production. India needs to urgently enhance its cold storage infrastructure by providing private sector with better investment incentives. It is entirely possible to end the cycle of gluts and shortages if we get this policy framework right."

Until last week, onion was selling at Rs 15-18 per kg but this week it has reached Rs 25-30 per kg. As they are used in almost all dishes, rise in prices of tomato and onions always disrupts the household budget.Wholesale price of onion has gone up from Rs 6-8 per kg to Rs 15-18 per kg. As per traders, the hike is because of incessant rains in Maharashtra , from where the state and city gets maximum supply.Another major reason is GST (Goods and Services Tax). ""Most of the transport companies have not revised their systems under GST so very few trucks are plying. Lack of carriage has hit supply, and in turn, the cost,"" said Arvind, a wholesale vegetable dealer of Dubagga.""Also, because of monsoon, the transportation time has increased from three to five days, which turns onions stale. More than 30% of them are discarded because of poor quality,"" said Sheraz Sadiq, another vendor.With seasonal vegetables already selling at a relatively high price because of heavy rains in the producing states, the overall cost of raw vegetables has sky-rocketed in the city.Housewife Shruti Singh said, ""Because of vegetables getting costlier, especially onions and tomatoes , the cost of each meal has gone up. Cooking chicken is cheaper than preparing a vegetarian dinner. Worst part is that though vegetables can be replaced by meat, there is no substitute for onions.""Bank employee Ritika Sharma said she has resorted to buying vegetables from wholesale market even though she has to buy a week's quota in advance. ""Shopping from mandi costs a little less than from street vendors, so I go to Dubagga mandi and buy whatever I want all at once,"" she said.Though the cost of tomato has dropped in wholesale markets in the past few days, it continues to sell at Rs 100-120 per kg in the city. ""For the past three days, tomatoes are selling at Rs 60-65 per kg in the wholesale market. Price dropped because supply is getting back to normal,"" said Rizwan, wholesale trader."

Better Kochi Response Group, a community that consists of doctors, chartered accountants, civil servants and more, has been urging people via various online forums, to stay away from tomatoes for the next fortnight, by which they believe the price should dip.Will it, really? Kochi Times quizzed fiscal experts, customer behaviour analysts and more, to see how such a tactic might play out.Customer behaviour expert Sony V Mathew says, ""I don't think anything can stop customers from buying an item, at least in smaller quantities. However, they can have an effect on the price when they become responsible buyers. For example, many shopkeepers tell me that people now buy tomatoes in quantities ranging from 100 grams to just two pieces."" That, in turn, will affect a perishable product like tomato, explain analysts.Is it illegal to influence an item's price, collectively? ""If someone tries to increase the price artificially, it is unacceptable. But there is nothing wrong if the buyers decide they want to stay away from buying a costly item,"" Sony says.Jose Sebastian, a Kochi-based fiscal expert, says, ""Tomato is a perishable product and therefore, if people decide not to purchase it, sellers will be naturally forced to reduce the price, especially in a State like Kerala where people can do without this product. Those belonging to the lower strata of the society will avoid it as soon as the price increases.""Currently, the price of tomato is on the higher side because of the short supply and also due to higher income groups buying it at the steep cost, he says.""However, if they too decide to steer clear off tomatoes as a result of social media campaigning, ideally, the prices must come down,"" explains Jose.Elaborating on this strategy, S Gopakumar of Better Kochi Response Group explains, ""This is a model of protest that has been successfully used in countries like Japan. Around the time we started the protest a few days ago, the cost of tomato was around `110. In the following days it came down to `85 and I am sure that it will go down further, if we persist with this strategy. Our target is to stabilise it between `50 and `60 and we are spreading this strategy through mediums like Whatsapp.""Tomato is a relatively new entrant in Kerala cuisine and can be easily done away with, say culinary experts. Renowned chef Noushad says, ""It's mostly when we prepare North Indian dishes that we use tomatoes. It can be easily replaced in our dishes. In sambar and rasam, it can be replaced with tamarind. In avial, curd can do the trick. Even in salads, it's not an absolutely necessary item.""He observes that households use tomato while preparing dishes like butter chicken and chicken roast. ""Even for these, we can use tomato puree,"" he says.Sony says that the price rise has also started out a positive trend. ""People have started growing tomatoes in their own homes. What they need for a few curries on a daily basis can be easily sourced from a kitchen garden, a few customers happened to tell me. If the price rise can at least push more people into cultivating enough for their own kitchen, it should be helpful in the long run,"" he says."

According to senior officials, 22 quintals of tomatoes had been sold at the Rythu Bazars in the last three days alone.Presently, a kilo of tomato costs between Rs 85 andRs 100 in Poorna Market. Even road-side vendors are charging in excess of Rs 80-Rs 90 a kg. To make it affordable, the marketing department has fixed the price at Rs 64 a kilo.Speaking to TOI, the marketing department assistant director M Kaleswara Rao said, ""We stocked 10,525 kgs of tomatoes on Saturday for sale at the special counters for next one or two days. We have so far sold around 22 quintals of the tomatoes at the Rythu Bazars.""According to Rao, all the Rythu Bazars need nearly 17,500 kgs of tomatoes to meet the demand from the consumers in a day.""Due to shortage of the tomatoes country-wide, we are forced to source the supply of around 10000 kgs from Kolar in Karnataka . The supply from the Madanapalle market in Chittoor has stopped. We are now getting the tomatoes from Kolar only,"" Rao added.MVP Rythu Bazar estate officer T Linga Murthy said that the nearly 10 counters in the Rythu Bazar were allowed to sell the tomatoes to avoid the rush from the consumers.

He told TOI, ""It's a rare occasion for us when the tomato yield shows indications of good returns. Though we hear that tomatoes are being sold at Rs 80 to Rs 100 per kg, we get only around Rs 50. But the price is a lot better, considering we used to sell tomatoes at Rs 2 per kg when there was no demand.""Pradeep Kumar from Srinivasapura taluk said a tomato farmer invests a minimum of Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3 lakh per acre of production and the crop matures in four months. ""If there is no proper price in the market, we don't get even the labour charges to pluck tomatoes. This is the reason farmers throw them on the road,"" he said. Though farmers are benefiting from the prices this time around, they are worried because the yield per acre has come down. ""We thought we could reap the benefits of good tomato prices but there is a problem. I have 8 acres for tomatoes and used to take 1,000 boxes (each of 15 kg) every day to the market. But this time, I could take only 200 boxes. We don't get proper groundwater even after drilling up to 1,200 feet.

Even allergy to dal items also seems to be uncommon, states 'A cross sectional study of the profile of food allergy among patients with chronic urticaria in Kerala'.The study was conducted by the department of pulmonary medicine, Government TD Medical College, Alappuzha, to identify the skin sensitivity to various food allergens in patients with chronic urticaria and to analyse the regional pattern of food allergy in Kerala. The study shows that 98% of patients with chronic urticaria had some form of food allergy. The common offending food allergens were wheat (28%), garlic (22%), ground nut (20%), cashew nut (18%), prawns (17%), ginger (16%), peas (12%) and black pepper (10%).""Food allergy can occur in isolation or in association with various clinical conditions such as chronic urticaria. The prevalence of food allergy is on the rise, owing probably to the changing food habits, multiplicity of food items with innumerable components and overuse of food additives and colouring agents.

The itching of the skin in case of chronic urticaria is more prominent at night. Prevalence of chronic urticaria is around 1% in general population and both children and adults can develop it. Women are affected twice as often as men and the common age group affected is between 30 and 50 years.Published in the Journal of Evidence Based Medicine and Healthcare (JEBMH), the study selected 100 patients with chronic urticaria who had predisposition towards developing certain allergic hypersensitivity reactions.""The treatment of chronic urticaria is challenging and if the aetiology is food allergy, the patients can lead a normal life by simply avoiding the offending foods and its components.

Since farmers anticipate a shortage of labour in the coming days, they have started harvesting whatever is grown. ""Several labourers will go on a pilgrimage in Aadi month. The crops, meanwhile, will start rotting after the onset of rain. So, we want to finish harvest as soon as possible,'' said a farmer.The prices are, however, still high compared to the previous Aadi months. Farmers say Rs 80 per kg for tomato is very high for this period of the year. Usually, vegetables such as tomato would be sold at throwaway prices during Aadi. This year, the cultivated area was less compared to previous years, due to water shortage. Also, the yield per acre has come down. ""On a normal year, the summer harvest will yield 10-20 tonnes of tomato per acre. Because of water shortage and extreme heat, the yield has dropped by 60% this year,"" said Senthil Kumar , a tomato farmer from Madhampatti.Farmers said they didn't expect the prices to drop further, a phenomenon usually witnessed as Aadi progresses. ""We have postponed harvest of onion to September after the rains,'' said Vijaykumar, a farmer, hinting that if at all there was a further price fall it would be after September. However, the cost of green chillies has been steadily increasing over the past one week, from Rs 30-Rs 40 per kg to Rs 88 on Tuesday. ""This is because chillies are coming from Mysuru. We are yet to get local stock from Erode, Chettipalayam and Thalavadi,'' said R Satheesh, a vegetable vendor at MGR Market."

Resultantly leading to the low tomato produce and subsequent shortage.Weather parameters in Goa have also played foul for vendors in Goa. ""While supplying freshly-harvested tomatoes to the state, some of the stock got ruined after being hit by rains along Goa's ghats.

The price of tomato has shot up by 25% in the past 15 days, with the vegetable selling for as much as Rs100 a kilo in some markets. Prices of other vegetables, such as capsicum and beans, have also shot up by Rs 20 akilo the the past two weeks.Vegetable retailers at Lake Market on Sunday sold tomato at Rs 100 a kilo, while prices in markets like the one at Manicktala hovered between Rs 95 and Rs 100 per kilo. ""Our hands are tied now. Prices have shown a sudden spurt at the wholesale markets in the past one week, and there has been an unprecedented rise,"" said Gopal Kundu , a retailer at Lake Market.In Koley market , one of the largest wholesale markets of the city, tomato sold at Rs 70 to Rs 72 a kilo. ""Most of the tomato supplies in Kolkata market come from Bengaluru at this time of year. There are price fluctuations every year, but this time it is beyond calculations,"" said Anup Gupta, a vegetable wholesaler at Koley Market.According to Uttam Mukherjee, chief supervisor of Koley market, supplies have come down by almost 30%. ""If a wholesaler was importing 10 trucks of tomatoes, he is now getting eight. Shortage in supplies is pushing up prices,"" he said. Some traders also procure tomato from wholesalers in Indore. ""We have never imagined that prices could go up to Rs 80 per kilo. There is a shortage in production. The Centre had provided support to farmers, but that seems to have had no reflection on the prices,"" said Sushil Soni, a tomato wholesaler in Indore, Madhya Pradesh.Vegetable traders on Sunday pointed out that agitating farmers across the country had destroyed truckloads of tomato last month. ""In some cases, the tomato crop was not even harvested,"" Soni said.Prices of other vegetables, mostly the ones procured from other states, have also headed north. ""Prices of capsicum and beans have gone up by Rs 20 per kilo in the last two weeks,"" said Kartik Saha , a vegetable retailer at Manicktala market.What has come as a breather is the stable price of local vegetables like striped gourd and brinjal. ""Prices of these vegetables have remained steady and are being sold between Rs 35 and Rs 40 per kilo,"" Mukherjee said.Buyers know there is going to be a rise and fall in the price of seasonal produce; it's a normal demand-and-supply thing playing itself out. But, when there is an abnormal and unchecked rise in the price of certain vegetables, then it may indicate something more than usual market forces at play. The situation calls for much stricter monitoring."

In the past week, tomato prices have skyrocketed leaving Bengalureans in a fix. While there is no clarity on what has caused the price rise, many feel that the Goods and Service Tax ( GST ) is the culprit behind it. Bangalore Times finds out more...BT found out that tomatoes were being sold in the market between Rs 75-90 per kilo. ""Of late the price of tomato has gone up. Last week when we brought tomatoes, it was Rs 74 per kg. Earlier, we used to pay as less as Rs 20 per kilo,"" says Pallavi Sengupta, a city-based professional, adding that the increased price has cut down the usage of tomatoes in her home by half. ""Since tomatoes are so expensive, we have cut down our usage by half and try our best not to waste any food,"" she says. But many like George Thomas, banking professional from the city, say that the increased price has not made a drastic change to their diet. ""I haven't faced an issue as such. Since I can afford it, I still buy the same amount of tomatoes. But am sure there are many who are facing problems and have cut down on their intake,"" he says.Nishtha Nayyar, a working professional in the city, says that she prefers buying vegetables especially tomatoes, from a vegetable market than a supermarket. ""We bought tomatoes for Rs 60 last week. Am sure in a supermarket it's as expensive as Rs 85 per kilo."" But has the increased price affected her in any way? ""Of course it has. We don't make dishes like pasta and others that require more tomatoes, as often as we used to. Since the price has gone up, I have become more conscious of the usage. In fact, my domestic help says that she has reduced using tomatoes in her household considerably,"" she adds.Contrary to the belief that GST may have a role in the price rise of tomatoes, vegetable vendors and owners tell us that GST has no bearing at all. ""Obviously there has been less rainfall  that has had an impact in the production. In addition to that, tomatoes are very cyclic. If one year the prices drop, the next year it shoots up,"" explains Amar Krishna Murthy, CEO, Towness. ""If the prices drop, people stop growing tomatoes. The following year, when the demand goes up there isn't enough quantity to meet the needs, which in turn results in the steep rise of prices,"" he says.Chandru, who works at a HOPCOMS stall, says that the monsoons have created a shortage. ""If we ask for 500 quintals, we get only 100 quintals. How will the demands be met?"" he asks, saying the scenario is likely to last for a month or so. He also clarifies that unlike what many think, GST has not affected the prices of vegetables and fruits. ""There is a solid shortage of tomatoes in the market,"" he adds.Another representative at Namdhari's Fresh, on the condition of anonymity, said that the prices of tomatoes are expected to remain the same for another month. ""It is all because of the monsoon. If the weather does not improve, the prices will continue to soar,"" he sums up. Amar, however, points out that he hasn't experienced a slump in sales as such, as tomato is one of the basic necessities in cooking. ""Tomato is hard to replace in cooking,"" he says adding that people are still buying it online inspite of the price rise."

At present, Delhi is only getting tomatoes from Himachal,"" he said.Across the city , buyers started to panic as the price of tomatoes zoomed by about Rs 20-40 since the beginning of the month.

Cost of bottle guard, pumpkin, pointed guard and cauliflower has dropped up to 40%.Wholesale dealer Shahikant Singh said, ""Rains damaged the tomato crop in Karnataka and also affected its transport."" Another wholesale dealer Kripal said, ""The supply has yet to normalise, hence cost of tomato and other vegetables will increase further.""Vegetables that have become cheaper are those which are grown locally or within the state. There was a glut since the produce could not be sent to other states because of heavy rains, so their prices went down.

With prices hovering around Rs 100/kg since about a fortnight now, the humble tomato  which is scientifically a fruit but commonly known as a vegetable owing to its rampant use in cooking savoury rather than sweet meals  is giving a fright to the common man. While vendors at some of the local markets claim that the price hike is due to interrupted supply because of the rains, those in the food business are among the worst hit. With tomato prices going through the roof, many are resorting to substitutes like canned puree and ketchup, leading to their dwindling stocks at various departmental stores.Gurleen Singh, owner of Hindusthan Dhaba , said they are bearing a loss of 3-4% at the moment. ""We are hoping that the situation will get better in the coming weeks. If the crisis persists, we will be forced to increase the price of our dishes by `5-`10 on an average,"" he said, explaining that gravy items, especially makhnis, are cooked with fresh tomatoes. However, Rahul Arora, proprietor of Paranthe Wali Galli , said their business remains unaffected as they don't use fresh tomatoes and cook with tomato puree instead.""We get our stock of canned tomato puree and since the price of that has not increased, we are not feeling the pinch,"" he told us. Chef Rangan Niyogi seconded Rahul as he said tomato puree is indeed a preferred ingredient in Indian kitchens. ""Readymade tomato puree is a great help in times of crisis. It can be used for churning out a variety of dishes. Generally, we use fresh tomatoes in numerous Indian dishes, like chicken butter masala, dal makhni, methi saag, aloo dum etc. But, currently I am using tinned tomato puree in place of fresh tomatoes and Kashmiri mirch in place of red chilli powder to make them taste close to tomato. However, in case of tomato chutney, it's not possible to substitute fresh tomatoes. For making tomato or minestrone soup, I am using carrot and tomato puree in place of fresh tomato. While carrot lends the vegetable flavour, tomato puree helps in getting the right taste and colour of the soup,"" he said.According to local vendors, tomato prices shooting up during this season is a common occurrence as rains spoil the stock. Tomatoes that have a shelf life of 3-4 days are hard to stock up at a time not many farmers have access to cold storage. Chef Joymalya Banerjee , however, feels the crisis is ""created"". ""Monsoon comes every year and it's not believable that the entire stock got ruined due to exceptional rains. Yet, there's a dearth in supply. So, if I ask vendors to deliver 5 kilos, they are giving only 2 kilos. This has been happening for the past two weeks,"" he said. The chef added that he doesn't believe in passing the burden on to the consumers. ""Everyone in the restaurant business keeps a buffer. For example, if the making cost of a dish is `10, it's sold at `30. For the loss of a rupee or so, it's not feasible to hike the price of a dish. There was a time when potato prices were hiked to an extent that some biryani makers dropped the aloo from the dish. That was juvenile, as it's not fair to victimise consumers all the time. I will hike the prices only when I can't bear the burden anymore,"" he reasoned.Though tomato prices started coming down on Wednesday and were available at `80 a kilo at some places, online grocery platforms such as Big Basket and Grofers continued to sell the kitchen must at over `100 a kilo. It was `109 a kilo at Big Basket and `110 a kilo at Grofers on Thursday. Cherry tomatoes and the organic variety came at `280 and `172.50 a kilo respectively."

As some families have up to several acres of land in possession, Jayakumar says apart from commercially cultivation of vegetables by the farmers, in the past two years, women developed a keen interest for organic farming.""We worked with women to create these garden in their backyards to meet the requirements of their families. A group named Ammakoottam was thus formed, who now practise home bazar.

They attributed the reasons for the same to shortage in stocks from their suppliers in the neigbouring states. The price has gone from Rs 20 per kg earlier this week to Rs 25 now.""Vegetable suppliers from the neighouring states are slowly running out of their existing onion stock. The rates will continue to remain high until the new crop is harvested there,"" they said.Weather parameters also played spoilsport resulting into loss of fresh stock.""Onions that were en route from Kolhapur and Nashik to Goa got soaked and spoiled on their way to the local markets. Therefore, the increase in rates,"" said vendor, Sadiq Shaikh.Tomato rates that continued to remain high for a large portion of July have considerably lowered this month. From going at Rs 80 per kg until earlier this week, the ripe reds have now come down to Rs 60 per kg. The rates are far lower in wholesale and at the horticulture run outlets across Goa. Tomatoes are sold at Rs 55 per kg at wholesale outlets, while horticulture outlets are selling it at Rs 45 per kg.""The tomato production in Maharashtra and Karnataka, where the tomatoes are sourced from, is slowly normalizing.

The word tomato itself comes from the word tomatl, its name in the Aztec language Nahuatl. Anglophones likely corrupted it to rhyme with potato. The French, trust them, called it pommes damour (love apples), believing it had aphrodisiacal properties.Stop right there if you are reaching for one. Even without libidinal attributes, the price of this squishy everyday companion to cooking (along with onion) has already hit a new high in India, arousing ire. At Rs 70 a kilo last week, it surpassed the price of mangoes that are on their way out of the market. By this weekend, it had raced into record territory at Rs 100-plus a kilo.Famously, the rising price of tur daal and onion  our meat and potatoes  is something governments are leery of. But tomato is, by comparison, an orphan.Remember, it was only weeks ago that we read about tomato growers in distress  selling their produce at as low as one rupee a kilo or simply throwing it away in protest on highways in drama reminiscent of La Tomatina, the festival held in the town of Buol, Spain  sans the festivities. In fact, this appears to be as much an annual occurrence in parts of India  particularly in the districts of Nasik and Kolar, the biggest tomato-growing areas  as the Valencian festival. What gives?At first blush, it would seem the tomato is getting squished entirely by seasonal factors and market forces, like so much other agricultural produce in India  particularly fruits and vegetables  that does not get government support price. Growing tomatoes is particularly dicey, says Aruna Urs, a farmer-in-residence at the think-tank Takshashila Institution, comparing it to a Las Vegas crapshoot. Unseasonal rain or unexpected heat, a mandi strike or market glut, could be the difference between boom and bust.Over the years, farmers have learned to navigate the treacherous terrain  not always successfully  using seeds that yield thick-skinned tomatoes (for longevity and ease of transport) and timing the pick to market. Urs himself speaks of planting this April by car headlights in the dead of the night to catch the right temperature (too warm and the seeds die).The result has been a bonanza  Rs 68/kilo in the wholesale market last week when anything above Rs 10/kilo is considered rich pickings. So if farmers who got crushed by Rs 1/kg price during the market glut are making a killing at Rs 100 a kilo, who can blame them? By the way, stories about middlemen milking it are vastly exaggerated. They do, but not to the extent of some of the tomato crorepati farmers who gamble by leasing hundreds of acres in what is a high-wire  high-vine  act.Still, the price variation of 100x is not just a factor of seasons and market forces, but also of cultural and culinary habits. India is notoriously shy of eating frozen and canned goods. No self-respecting Indian would be caught using tomato that is in any way processed or pureed, sliced or diced, into a can or container. Thanks to vast tracts of arable and fecund lands, landing fresh produce is no problem in most parts of the country even if there is a groundwater crisis.By contrast, in the US, where tomato accounts for 22% of vegetable consumption (outside the technicality of it being a fruit), more than 50% of tomatoes are consumed as tomato products  processed, pureed, pasted etc. What did the papa tomato say to the baby tomato? A: Hurry and ketchup! goes the joke. Q: How do you get rid of unproductive tomatoes? A: Can them. As a result, retail price of tomatoes in the US has hovered between a low of $1.21 and a high $2.47 per pound over the last 20 years  nothing like the Rs 1 to Rs 100 variation in India.To be sure, theres enormous merit in the way Indians consume fresh produce, including the tomato in all its fiery colour and cool completeness (Pablo Neruda). Instead of eating fruits and vegetables in their original state, much of the West, particularly the US, soup them up with sodium and sugar, adding needless calories and subtracting dietary fibre. Last year, the grocery chain Whole Foods invited outrage and ridicule by selling pre-peeled oranges.But there is now sufficient research to show that frozen produce is not always nutritionally leached, and in some cases, enhances it. Sans sodium, canned is not dicey either. Of course, there is nothing to beat fresh, but as long as India does not accept enforced longevity of produce, both farmers and consumers will have to periodically deal with crapshoots in the fruit and vegetable market."

Supplies of onions in Market Yard have dwindled because of rotting in the godowns during the rains.Meanwhile, the price of tomato , the other kitchen staple, simmered to Rs 50-60 per kg from Rs 100 in July. Dilip Khaire, chief administrator of Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), Pune told TOI that the rainy season often sees fluctuation in prices because of the problem it poses for reaping vegetables from the fields.""The recent rise in onion prices is the result of stocks rotting in the godowns they are stored in during the recent rain,"" Khaire said. He added that vegetable crops are susceptible to disease during the rainy season. ""Areas around Pune, such as Velhe, Mulshi, Bhor, Ambegaon and Junnar, that are to the west of Pune received good rainfall in the last few days, which caused supply problems in many vegetables, including onions,"" he saidNew onion stocks will enter the markets post-Diwali, Khaire added. APMC officials had earlier told TOI that incessant rain after mid-July damaged the tomato crops, causing supply to fall and prices to go up to Rs 100 per kg.Onion supply data from APMC showed that since August 1, when close to 11,423 quintals of onions came into the APMC market, supplies dipped to 9,615 quintals on August 2 and 8,985 quintals on August 3.Though 18,760 quintals of onion entered the wholesale market on August 4, prices continued their upward trendfrom Rs 700 to Rs 1,500 on August 1 to Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,600 on August 4. Another APMC official said onions in the wholesale market were being sold at around Rs 22 per kg on Thursday, which went up to Rs 25 on Friday.""The reduction in rainfall over the last few days has also caused a dip in cultivation of vegetables, including onions,"" he said. Yakub Pathan, owner, Fresh Vegetable Market, Wakad, said the retail price of onion is bound to be higher on Saturday.""From Rs 30 on Friday, it may go up to Rs 35 to Rs 40 on Saturday depending on the supply with retailers. Tomato supplies have normalized to an extent, but onion supplies are 50% less in the wholesale market on account of some stocks rotting due to rains,"" said Pathan.Vegetable vendors in the city on Friday were selling onions at Rs 30 per kg, as against Rs 15 on August 2. ""Tomato prices have come down to Rs 50-Rs 60. Though tomato prices have come down there is less supply,"" Inder Sen, a vendor in Koregaon Park, said."

The tuber, which was sold at `14 a kg a month back, now costs `30.Even as the State Government fixed the upper limit of onion at `17 a kg last week and opened Maitri shops (model fair price outlets) to sell it across the State to unburden the consumers, the retailers flout the order with impunity reportedly for lack of enforcement.General secretary of Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said, they are unable to supply onion at `16 a kg to Maitri shops as the supply price soared by `8 to `10. The price may escalate further due to scanty supply from the source States, he said.Odisha largely depends on Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh for onions. The supply came down drastically as the crop was ruined in Andhra due to lack of rain during kharif season and onions worth around `100 crore was damaged in floods in MP last month.Now, we completely depend on Nashik where the onion was priced at `2,500 to `2,600 per quintal on Tuesday. What can we do if the product is high priced at the source? We are managing since we had booked the commodity at less price a fortnight back, Panda said.Though Odisha, which consumes around 1500 tonne onion daily, stands second in the country after Maharashtra in area under onion cultivation, the productivity of the crop is very less compared to other major onion producing States.Panda said Odisha produces nearly 1.2 lakh tonne onion every year. But, it fails to utilise it within the State as a major share is diverted to Raipur. He, however, claimed that the price here is less compared to other States where the edible tuber is being sold at more than `40 a kg.Both the State Government and the Centre have to intervene to check the price rise. The Centre has to hold talks with vested interest traders in Nashik to regulate the onion price, he added."

The impact is also felt all over the South and the northern States. Currently, the crop is not raised in Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan due to adverse climatic conditions. These two States are the usual competitors to the Madanapalle grades.During the last one month, the tomato trade has been playing truant with not only the farmers, but also agents from across India, and the domestic retail market in Chittoor, Kadapa, Anantapur and Bellary (Karnataka). The price which stood at Rs. 20 a kg in the first week of June started taking giant leaps week after week, and now reached a level virtually creating panic among the public at Rs. 100 a kg.Alarming dip in arrivalsAs per the latest trend, the wholesale market price on Monday stood at Rs. 78 per kg (first grade) and the second grade at Rs. 48-54 per kg (based on quality and size). The arrival for the day was 241 metric tonnes. There had been an alarming dip in the arrivals since a week from 400 MT last week, followed by 311 MT on Thursday last and 277 MT on Sunday. In contrast, arrivals peaked to 750 MT per day in June-July 2016.The first grade stock, forming 40% of the arrivals, is exported to the metros in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and MP and some malls in Tirupati, Chittoor and Srikalahasti in the district. The second grade is sent to the urban centres of Chittoor district with a mind-blowing retail price at Rs. Rs. 90-100 a kg in vegetable markets and petty shops.This is double the wholesale price. Same situation is reported from elsewhere in towns of surrounding districts of Anantapur, Kadapa; and bordering Kolar and Chikballapur districts of Karnataka, while the price is even slightly up in the border areas of Tamil Nadu. The steep hike is attributed to the damage of the stock during transit, escalation of transportation charges and poor shelf life.Turns invisibleThe impact is clearly felt on the hotel industry and households.A majority of home-makers are forced to substitute the prized vegetable with tamarind juice. The roadside eateries and pani-poori carts are doubly cautious while using it; and it has turned invisible in salads of considerably big restaurants and bars. Though most customers tend to avoid buying it, retail and petty traders are not affected by the scenario, with the smooth disposal of small stocks thanks to a limited number of customers essentially in need of the temporarily unreachable vegetable. Meanwhile, traders said the situation would ease by mid August."

The rate of green chillies was Rs. 80 a kg and carrot Rs. 60 a kg in retail market.There was, however, something to cheer for consumers when they went to market as all dals registered a steep decline in prices over last year.The Directorate of Economics and Statistics attributed the decline to higher production because the cropped area of pulses went up. The pulses production in 2016-17 was estimated at 5.29 lakh tonnes which was 2.82 lakh tonnes more than the previous year.Agriculture Production Commissioner C. Parthasarathi told The Hindu that the hike in prices of tomatoes and green chillies was a regular phenomenon at this time of the year because they were cultivated in high temperatures from April to mid-June, which led to poor yield. Hence, it was decided on Monday to invest Rs. 10 crore on shade nets where they would be grown next year. He dismissed carrot as of no use to the common man.Telangana was largely dependent on purchase of tomatoes from Madanapalle in Chittoor district and Chintamani and Kolar in Karnataka from June to August. As the crop in Karnataka and Maharashtra was also damaged this year due to rains, the stock of Madanapalle was diverted to those States, said G. Lakshmi Bai, Director, Agricultural Marketing.She expected heavy arrivals at Bowenpally market yard here which is the main source of vegetable supply in October as fresh sowings have just started. But, the present rate of tomatoes would continue for at least a fortnight.The price of tomatoes went up steadily from Rs. 30 a kg last month. The hike was Rs. 20 in the last two days."

Amid reports of differences in the price at various retail outlets, the city administration came to the rescue of the locals by making onions available for `20 per kg at 37 government-run fair price shops.Assistant Civil Supplies Officer (ACSO) R C Tudu said 35 quintals of onions were supplied to fair price shops on Saturday. He further pointed out that the retail price of onion at some places rose to `28 per kg on Sunday, with the wholesalers claiming the price of fresh consignment to be `2,400 per quintal. The wholesalers are selling onions for `2,600 per quintal after adding the transportation cost, Tudu added.The officer claimed that the fair price shops will sell fresh stocks at no profit-no loss basis, adding that each wholesaler has been allowed to maintain a maximum stock of 300 quintals.There are no reports of hoarding at the local level. The citys estimated consumption of onions per day is about 130 quintals, claim sources in Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare department. Meanwhile, the hike in prices of vegetables has added to the woes of the consumers. The rise in onion price is an additional burden with tomato selling at `70-80 per kg, and most of the vegetables being sold at `40 and above, a housewife, Manavi Sharma, said."

According to retailers, this is perhaps the first time that tomato prices have crossed the Rs. 100 mark, according to retailers. The higher quality tomatoes from Bangalore cost a bit more at Rs. 120 a kg in Mumbai, they said.Every monsoon, prices would go up to around Rs. 80 due to shortage, but this time it is worse. There is an acute shortage in the market, Harishchandra Gupta, a vegetable vendor in the western suburbs, said.Sources said the sudden shortage in tomatoes is a direct fallout of the state-wide protest by farmers last month. They said rampaging mobs of farmers demanding loan waivers had destroyed truckloads of tomatoes across the State. This, sources said, had forced a large number of marginal tomato farmers to destroy their standing crop as they feared the protest could continue.Small farmers were scared. The off-take from their fields had stopped. Fearing more loss, they preferred to uproot the standing crop much before the harvest and plant other crops. This has lead to a supply problem, which is expected to continue till August, a tomato trader said.In just two days, prices have gone up from Rs. 80 per kg to Rs. 100 per kg. Two months ago, tomato was selling at Rs. 16 per kg.This is the part of the year when Maharashtra supplies tomatoes to many parts of the country including north India. The shortage at in the State has not only pushed prices up in Mumbai, but also in U.P., Rajesh Kumar, a vegetable seller, said.Prices up at retail chainsAt supermarkets like Big Bazaar, tomatoes were selling for Rs. 85 to Rs. 90 per kg. Surprisingly, prices at the comparatively upmarket Godrej Natures Basket was lower at Rs. 67 per kg. Analysts said this is because such stores have long term supply contracts with growers.Tomato prices touched Rs. 80 in Mira-Bhayandar and Vasai-Virar, evoking strong reactions from homemakers. Its not possible to buy tomatoes any more, said Ruma Bose, a Vasai resident.Officials at the Agricultural Produce Marketing Corporation (APMC), Vashi said the supply of tomatoes has gone down by nearly half. While the demand across the city and its suburbs is more close to 3,000 quintal per day, today only about 1,290 quintal has come to the APMC, an APMC official said.Shivaji Pahinkar, secretary, APMC Vashi, said wholesale prices hovered between Rs. 45 and Rs. 60 per kg on Thursday. Declining to pinpoint why tomato supply has dried up, Mr. Pahinkar attributed it to the vagaries of crop production and market economics. We cannot say for sure why there is a surge in prices, he said, while ruling out GST as a factor.Regional mandis (markets) from where retailers procure their supplies are charging between Rs. 70 and Rs. 80 per kg, which is being sold in retail at Rs. 100. We are not responsible for the retail prices, said Mr Pahinkar. You can add 30% to our prices for transport and miscellaneous charges, he added.Ramkrishna Yadav, a vegetable seller at Mira Road, is not happy with the soaring prices.We plan on picking up a certain amount of vegetables at the wholesale market, but we come away with much less as prices are high. This has been the situation for the past fortnight.Ganesh Pinglay, a wholesaler in Vashi, said this price rise could be due to shortfall in production. A couple of months ago, tomato prices hit rock bottom, and farmers could not even recover their production cost, so they didnt go ahead with the second tomato crop. Now they will plant another crop, which should come to the market in another month-and-a-half, he said.Two months ago, tomato prices fell so much farmers couldnt recover production cost, so they didnt go ahead with the second tomato cropGanesh PinglayVashi-based wholesale dealer"

Nallasamy, president of the association here in a press release.Mr. Nallasamy, who is also the president of Federation of Tamil Nadu Agriculturists Association, criticised the proposal of the State Government for sanction of power connection under tatkal system to farmers, saying it would not be of any use to economically backward farmers.The one-time payments of Rs. 2.75 lakh fixed for five hp motor and Rs. 3 lakh for 10 hp motor will suit only the affluent section of cultivated, Mr. Nallasamy said.Holding the government responsible for the rapid rise in the price of tomato, he said the evaluation of requirements for domestic use and export and the productivity level ought to have been the basis for determining the acreage of cultivation.The practice in vogue in other countries is ignored in India. Such price fluctuation hits hard both the farmers and consumers, Mr. Nallasamy said."

Not on the dance floor as her excellent grooving in films such as Kaabil makes everyone presume . It is at fitness studio where the energetic actress perspires after a vigorous round of kick boxing. Sceptics need to watch her video on Instagram to understand the importance she gives to fitness. On the International Yoga Day, the actress went a step further when she demonstrated how an extremely difficult scorpion pose, part of yoga, could be executed.Urvashis passion for weight training despite busy film schedule leave even her die hard fans bewildered.Some might find her schedule back breaking, taxing and even bordering on insanity, but for this Haridwar girl it is a routine she does with a smirk on her face. And through social media, she is able to motivate her fans on what more can be done than just the humdrum gym schedule.Urvashi, who came to launch Golds Gym in Gurugram recently, describes herself as a professional athlete. Mom was also an athlete; so fitness runs in my blood. Since childhood, I was ingrained into sports. It plays an important part in my life. Fitness is just like marriage; you cannot cheat on it and think it would benefit you. People need to incorporate it as part of their daily life, she says.If I hadnt been into films, I would have still continued with my workout. I do a healthy blend of mixed martial arts, dancing, functional training and swimming. These exercises give me ample strength, endurance, flexibility and stamina. The idea is to surprise your body with new kind of exercises. If you do the same gym workout, body goes into a comfort zone. Yes, I do weight training like squats, bench press, lunges but I keep rotating them.Sporty girlInterestingly, Urvashi has been a national level basketball player. Any outdoor sport like volleyball can also be played as a workout. It would be a surprise for many to know that I was into multiple sports like javelin, high jump, long jump at St. Joseph Convent.Pointing out that any kind of aerobic exercise helps in shaping up an individuals body, Urvashi says: It helps you to burn calories. It all depends on which body part you want to focus on. If you want great thighs work on lunges.She maintains that fitness has to be a lifelong goal. If you are healthy inside, you are healthy outside. I eat avocado and green vegetables. I take egg whites but keep alternating them with upma and poha. We have lot of protein in our dals, which I take along with broccoli. I have an addiction for green tea; I take eight cups of tea. It has lot of anti oxidants.Shunning supplementsWhile her colleagues in the film industry take supplements, Urvashi doesnt touch them at all.Though I am from glamour industry, I am against taking supplements. I dont look down at people who take shakes but why not take natural home-made diet instead of powder. I have won so many pageants because of my hard work. I never had protein shake in my life. Avocado, tomatoes, coconut juice, lemons, onions, tomatoes and garlic are all superfoods.Like any young woman, Urvashi likes chocolates, dark chocolates.But she also knows how to burn calories and not let the saccharine harm her physique.The idea is to surprise your body with different sets of exercises."

Our two-inch tongue rules our six-feet body. And the stomach takes on the role of a garbage bag, says the restaurateur. While Shettys two aforementioned eateries have been the go-to place for greasy dosas and cheesy pizzas, his new mission is to change the way we eat with his latest offering: Aharveda, located inside Golden Chariot.Aharveda has been decorated in warm shades of yellow with verses from the Gita and vedas painted on the wall and copper chandeliers above each table. The server welcomes us with a Red Roar (Rs 150) drink comprising carrot, beetroot, tomato, mint, betel leaves, coriander and gooseberries. Served at room temperature, the taste is of a Bloody Mary without the alcohol, we joke.Shetty, who started Aharveda, a food science company that conducts sessions of the importance of healthy eating, and using food to treat imbalances, shares an anecdote. We have gone to the moon, in the bargain we have lost our own powers. We understand everything other than ourselves. Picture this, theres a water tank with a faulty hole through which dirty water seeps in. This water goes to all the houses in the building. Every family, sends the sample for checking, pumps it with pesticide and insecticide to clean the water and uses it for consumption. Wouldnt it be wiser if we repaired that hole? says Shetty, who has created recipes that are an extension of his philosophy.Ahar means food in Sanskrit and it is really our medicine shop, says Shetty, offering us a cream of mushroom soup thats light on the palate, but not on flavours. Garnished with mushroom slices and a drizzle of coconut milk, we dont miss the usual onion, garlic or cream. The surprise is the pizza, with its crisp base of tapioca flour and a cheesy topping of cashew nut dust. It has everything and more a vegetarian pizza would have  olives, tomato paste and capsicums. Our eyebrows remain raised as we dig into the Mexican platter (Rs 350) of tacos, made with rajgira seeds and corn, and nachos served with a spicy salsa, guacamole, and a walnut and cashew nut sauce that replaces cheese.The Ahar Veda thali served on silverware has rice rotis, a roasted potato and corn cutlet, besan chura, rasam, cauliflower sabzi and sukka suran (elephant yam) and a serving of kheer. The offering is complete with pickled carrots (dried in-house by Shettys team and made in small batches so it doesnt need oil). The chaas (Rs 90) made from coconut milk is frothy and creamy.Shettys diversion into healthycooking began 10 years ago, when the teetotaller and non-smoker went to the doctor gasping for breath. All my parameters were abnormal, I had high blood pressure, uric acid, blood pressure, diabetes. What does health mean, I asked myself? recalls Shetty, who went on to study naturopathy. I am a second-generation restaurateur and I started working in the kitchen when I was in the seventh standard. So, I understand human emotions when it comes to food. I want my customers to believe that they can counter imbalances by choosing the right food, he asserts.If you head out to Aharveda, do remember, that their last order is at 8 p.m., as according to naturopathy rules, you shouldnt be eating later than that.Aharveda , Andheri West; 40722211/40722212"

But, the market had been receiving only half the load in the past few weeks owing to lack of rainfall and low yield.On Friday, arrival of additional five lorry loads eased the escalating cost. Only 25% of tomatoes arrived from the State Tamil and the rest was sourced from neighbouring States of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.Small onions were also priced high owing to fewer load arrivals and was even sold up at Rs. 110 per kg in retail market.P.Sukumar, joint secretary, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants Association, said the cost of many vegetables was beginning to dip this week. Several vegetables such as carrots and beans that were costlier were now priced at least 20 % lower now.We expect prices tocome down further once the Tamil month Aadi started in a few days. The cost of tomatoes too would stabilise in a week or ten days. Arrivals to the market would improve. However, there would be less demand for vegetables due to Aadi month and this would bring down prices, he said."

I had stumbled upon the name while surfing the net. It sounded good, for on the menu were all kinds of interesting sandwiches and pasta dishes. But the problem was that I just couldnt find it.The address was 39 Meharchand Market. I found No. 39, but that was not an eatery. I walked up the stairs and knocked at a door, and found it locked. I came down, asked some peoplemost of whom were clueless. Then a good Samaritan asked me to try the back entry through a small lane behind the shops lining the main market. I followed the directions, and luckily found a small sticker that told me I was on the right track. I followed the sign, walked up a steep flight of stairsand finally I was in CJs Fresh.Interesting menuCJs Fresh is a take-away which does deliveries (Phone: 9910501234; email: fresh@cjsfresh.com). Run by a young lady called Chahat Jain, it has an interesting menuwith sandwiches, pasta, pizzas, burgers, fries, milkshakes and desserts. I had done my research, so I knew what I wanted even before I landed up there. I had seen a picture of a bowl of pasta with juicy pieces of bacon on it, so that was on top of my list. Then we had decided to have a vegetable sandwich, and a meaty one.The formercalled Getting Grilled (Rs. 280), comprised eggplant, zucchini, mushroom, cherry tomatoes, rocket leaves, smoked cheese, herbs and CJs secret sauce. The Ham and Cheddar Affiliation (Rs. 349 ) had roasted ham and melted cheddar cheese with aioli and herbs. The Carbonara Crewfor Rs. 349was a bacon, cheese and pasta dish.I got talking to a lady at the counter, and heard that the place was started by her daughter just four months ago. She had studied in the US, and had returned to India full of food plans. She now wants to start an outlet near Chhattarpur.It should prosper, for the sandwiches were excellent. The pasta was superb, creamy and cheesy, as Carbonara is meant to be, and the bacon pieces were juicy and plump and fried just right. I had asked for a wheat pasta preparation, so I felt quite healthydespite all the rich bits that had gone in itwhen I was done with it.Secret sauceThe sandwiches (grilled panini, focaccia or multigrain) were soft and full of goodies. The fillings were fresh, and the cheese had oozed nicely into the ham-and-cheddar sandwich. The veggie one had a burst of flavourswith rockets and cherry tomatoes complementing the smoothness of the smoked cheese. I dont know what their secret sauce is (its secret, so I didnt ask), but it certainly gave a zing to the sandwich.I am quite a burger fiend, so I want to try out CJs burgers one of these days. The descriptions sound good: Twisty Aloo Burger (Rs. 279) has a potato filling with mint mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomatoes, sauted onions and cheddar cheese; the Pork Pack (Rs. 379) consists of pulled pork tossed in sweet chipotle, pickled black olives and mozzarella and Gangsta Lamb (Rs. 399) has a lamb patty topped with a three cheese blend, pine nuts, caramelised onions, lettuce and herbs, in a special hung curd dip.The lady insisted that I try out a slice of their fresh cheesecake. I agreed, and found it delicious, though I thought it was somewhere in between a cheesecake and a souffl. The Cheesecake Monopoly is for Rs. 210, and they have, among other things, a peanut butter and white chocolate cookie coalition (Rs. 120 for two) and Mos Nutella Fried Oreos (Rs. 150 for 5 pieces).I like young people with big dreams, and hope their dreams all come to true. The secret sauce should do its bit."

Bullied by the Dragon on the east, who constantly threatens war on the flimsiest of grounds. Pestered by the eternal enemy to the west, who is emboldened by the support it receives from the Dragon as well as by its impending victory in Afghanistan.India has a friend in Israel. Other than that, it really doesnt have a friend in the world. But Israel has its own constraints. It is too small. It makes great arms, but of the bits-and-pieces kind. Befriending Israel has allowed India to get on the right side of the influential American Jewish community.And we should close our market to American goods unless and until Trump sees sense on the H-1B front. Enough of flaky diplomacy. Its time for realpolitik. Enough of having had our eyes glaze over by the allure of America. Russia may not be nearly as cool, but it will come to our aid in times of crisis like America never will.But Americas Jews have been unable to prevent America from dumping Israel for Iran. Israel became livid with Obama. But Trump is honouring the Iran deal. And then Israel craves recognition from its enemies, many Muslim nations. Already the Saudis are buddies with Israel. What happens if they recognize Israel, and then Pakistan follows suit?In any case, Israel is too small, too besieged, too far away from India to come to our aid in any substantive fashion in case of a conflict with the Dragon.If the conflict with the Dragon explodes into anything more than a mere skirmish, expect the eternal enemy to jump into the fray. Pakistans media is eerily silent on the friction between us and the Dragon. Now that the generals are fully in charge of the country, they are not going to sit idle in opening a second front. It would represent a dream opportunity for them.So what should we do? Just follow what the expert of realpolitik, Indira Gandhi, did. Kiss and make up with the Russians. Boris Yeltsin admittedly was openly derisive of India. That made Messrs. Rao, Vajpayee, and Manmohan, turn by turn, spurn the Russians for the allure of the US.But what has true friendship with the US got us? Empty platitudes such as natural allies, strategic partners, and little else. Sure we got the nuclear deal, but the Americans, just because their own reactors are defunct and outdated, keep pushing more and more liability down our throats.Trump came to power promising to curb H-1Bs and launch a trade war with China. He has done none of the latter, but has gone after H-1Bs with full force. H-1Bs constitute our major export to the US. Today we have Heinz tomato sauce instead of the earlier-perfectly delicious Kisan, Lays potato chips instead of Indian versions, and Coca Cola and Pepsi instead of Thums Up and Campa Cola.American goods have flooded India, and keep flooding in more and more. India has an upper middle and elite class of 150 million which can afford anything that the 100 million American middle and upper class can. America is saturated as a market. India represents a new America to the Americans. Thats why they drool all over us with idle lip-service.America has not got us what we want  a UN permanent seat. Nor have the British and the French. Yet we keep buying major arms and goods from them. We should close our markets to them unless and until they get us the UN seat. Even so, they will not come to our aid in case of conflict with our neighbours.Thats where Vladimir Putin and Indira Gandhi come in. Putin has been cold to India. He is miffed at us for abandoning him for the West. But Leonid Brezhnev was no easy customer. And Indira was able to bear hug him to save us from the Americans.Our first port of call for any major arms supply should be the Russians. We should consider signing a treaty of friendship and eternal cooperation with them just as Indira did. The effect on the Chinese will be immediatethey will back off. We should buy arms from the West only if the Russians cannot supply them to us.And we should close our market to American goods unless and until Trump sees sense on the H-1B front. Enough of flaky diplomacy. Its time for realpolitik. Enough of having had our eyes glaze over by the allure of America. Russia made not be nearly as cool, but it will come to our aid in times of crisis like America never will.Lets just do what Indira did in 1971 and made India proud of her. By doing so, we will make her proud of us."

(Above and three-column image below) Pictures show the Sardar wholesale agricultural market, in Surat, Gujarat.R.V. MoorthyR_V_MoorthyIt is past noon and the Sardar wholesale agricultural market in Surat is bustling with activity. Trucks drive in every minute and so do lorries smaller in size. Farmers arrive in these with loads of agricultural produce to sell. The place has multiple rows of platforms interspersed with streets and parking spots. Each platform is dedicated to different kinds of produce: onion, fruits, vegetables, etc. Things move with clockwork precision. Daily-wage labourers offload the sacks of farm produce from trucks, dumping them in huge heaps on the floor of the platforms. A different set of merchants buys this grain and transports it from here, to be sold in towns nearby. The merchants registered here who act as conduits for the sale take a 6% commission on the produce sold. The rest goes to the farmer, and is delivered in cash on the second or fourth day.This correspondent  who accompanied the ongoing yatra of farmers organisations from Madhya Pradesh to Delhi through parts of Maharashtra and Gujarat  took a detour to talk to people at this wholesale market to make sense of agricultural marketing operations.Ebb and flow of pricesThe place is a market seeing daily fluctuations of prices, based on demand and supply. If a greater quantity of a crop comes to the market on a given day and fewer merchants land up to buy it, the price falls. If more merchants come and there is dearth of a commodity, the price rises. Farmers benefit from a higher price and return disappointed if the prices are low. The prices fluctuate even within a day. To sell for a good price is like being lucky in a draw of lots.Rakesh Bhambre and Sunil Sonone, who have driven down in a rented truck from Daswel village of the Baglan taluka in Nashik district of Maharashtra, have had a hectic day. They arrived here at 2 a.m. Through the morning, they have sold their onions, which were harvested in April, and have managed to get a price of Rs. 6-7 per kg, which is not bad. They will now head back to their village in a bit. The merchant will send them the money for their produce in cash two days from now, which another truck coming from their village will deliver to them.The two Nashik farmers say they engage only in farming and have no side work to do. Their annual calendar is hectic. In June/July and October, they sow sugar cane, which requires a lot of water and takes close to nine months to be ready. This year isnt a good one for sugar cane, they fear, as it isnt raining yet. They sow onion in August and also in November. They have brought the harvest of their November crop of onion here, they say. The advantage with onion is that it can also be stored for four-five months.They also sow tomato in June and July, and the crop takes two months to be ready.The agricultural process requires a variety of expenses. They need to buy seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and machines on hire for harvesting. They have to pay the bills for power consumed while watering their fields. They also need to hire labour for various operations, from preparing the fields, taking care of the crop to loading the produce on to trucks. Labour charges range from Rs. 70-100 a day.These expenses  varying for different crops  are facilitated both by the money they get by selling their previous produce in the market and by borrowing from cooperative banks, nationalised banks and regional rural banks at an interest of around 7%. Sometimes, they have to borrow from private merchants too, at a higher rate of interest on a monthly basis. Most farmers are under debt of a few lakhs, and sometimes borrow from one lender to pay another. A good crop and remunerative prices  a matter of chance  can lead to better incomes. A slump in prices of a crop or erratic monsoon can lead to loss.The variegated world of farmersThis year, farmers in Nimaad region of Madhya Pradesh and in adjoining parts of Maharashtra  like Nashik and Ahmednagar  are still awaiting rains. If it does not rain for another week, they say, their crops will be damaged. Villages, of course, have farmers of varying means. The richer ones have more land  perhaps 20 acres  and can try three or four kinds of crops in their fields. If one fails, they believe the other will not. The smaller farmers find it harder to get by.The truck in which Bhambre and Sonone brought their produce to Surat has been hired from a bigger farmer of their village, who owns trucks and hires them out.These two farmers  each owning 7-8 acres of land  however spend the year in farming, both with their family labour and hired daily wagers. The poorest in villages own no land of their own, and work on the fields of others.The wealthier farmers have also diversified into related occupations and other businesses as an additional cushion, as farming is not very lucrative and yields and prices are unpredictable. The poorest in the agricultural world either work others fields or do additional work as rickshaw pullers, construction workers, etc., sometimes becoming poor migrants. Hours before reaching the Surat market, this correspondent visited Koribhartna village near Surat, where daily wagers were working the fields of a richer farmer where okra was being grown. Dinesh, a daily-wage labourer of the village with no land of his own, said he works through the year at a daily wage of Rs. 100. He gets one or the other agricultural work through the year, he says, but adds that the money he earns is not enough for maintaining his family well.Pandane village in Nashik district is situated close to a dam from where it gets what villagers complain is sand-laced water. Pradip Shivaji Chitte, whose joint family has 7.5-acres of land, of which he works on just 2.5, has opened a small shop dealing in seeds, fertilisers and pesticides. He rented this shop two months ago in a bid to diversify beyond farming. I invested Rs. 1 lakh in this; some of my friends also contributed, he says. But till now, I am just being able to break even. Chitte says he is under Rs. 16-lakh debt and practises grape farming in the village. In our village, half the farming is grape farming; the rest is of all other crops, he says.Just preparing the fields for the crops entails a labour charge of Rs. 20,000 per acre, he claims. The fields are prepared from September and the harvest comes only by January, before which the crop requires a lot of care. The total expense, including labour, fertilisers and pesticides, comes to Rs. 1.6-1.7 lakh per acre. The selling of the produce begins from January and it sells at about Rs. 18-25 per kg. If one subtracts the expense borne from the selling price per acre, the profit is Rs. 45,000-50,000. This is the annual income for growing grapes per acre. Chitte says bigger farmers aiming at exports prepare their fields a month earlier  they also get higher prices when they sell their produce, he adds.Farmers in the Nimaad region of Madhya Pradesh also grow hybrid crops like Bt cotton.The same is the case in neighbouring districts of Maharashtra like Nashik. Jagdish Patidar, who came to Barwani for a day from Maheshwar in Madhya Pradesh to take part in the ongoing rally of farmers organisations, says he too grows Bt cotton, which requires more supply of water and higher input costs. What they look for is higher prices for their produce.Bt cotton costs more but is high yield and therefore more lucrative for farmers. When a new variety that is advertised as high yield comes, farmers will take to it for profits, says Lakhwinder Singh, an agriculture expert at Punjabi University, Patiala. Many farmers also took to it as it was advertised as resistant to bollworm, a pest that affected cotton. However, Singh cautions, the pest resistance is only for three-four years.Agitations and farmers yatraThe ongoing farmers agitations are demanding state support for making farming more lucrative. They demand that the M.S. Swaminathan Committees recommendation  that the government-announced minimum support price (MSP) should be 1.5-times the cost of production  be implemented. They are also demanding farm loan waiver, as many farmers are under large debt. However, a loan waiver does not ease the burden of loans taken from private parties.Till July 14, a Kisan Mukti Yatra involving several farmers organisations has been moving through Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, addressing villagers and articulating these demands. The participants argue that while input costs for farming have been rising, the rise in MSP has been sluggish.Swaraj Abhiyan leader and academic Yogendra Yadav, Narmada Bachao Andolan leader Medha Patkar, Maharashtra farmer leader Raju Shetti, the All India Kisan Sabha, Kisan Sangharsh Morcha, Bhartiya Kisan Union of Punjab, and other organisations are taking part in the yatra, which will converge on Jantar Mantar in Delhi on July 18. It began in Madhya Pradesh, with the farmers leaders being detained for a few hours by the police, and passed through Indore, Barwani  visiting village Barda, which is in the submergence zone of the Sardar Sarovar dam  Nashik, Vyara and Surat in Gujarat, Bhilwara and Jaipur in Rajasthan, among other places. There are regular halts to interact with people, with crowds varying from a few hundred to a few thousand turning up.The yatra comes close on the heels of the deaths of six farmers in police action in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, and a strike by Maharashtra farmers early in June, when they decided to let their farm produce and milk perish but not sell it in the absence of lucrative prices. The strike was broken in 48 hours after talks with the Maharashtra government, which made a few announcements: loan waivers for small and debt-ridden farmers; a Bill to criminalise buying produce at rates below the MSP; the setting up of a State Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices on the lines of the Centre to look into MSP issues. The State government also offered to subsidise farmers power bills, hike milk prices and set up cold storage chains for preserving the produce.Making farming sustainableThe journey shows one thing  that farming, which sustains more than half of Indias population even if many of them also do other things on the side for supplementary income, is not a lucrative proposition. Farmlands have become smaller over generations and, except for large farmers, many do not find it rewarding but find themselves ill-trained for other occupations, says Patidar, the farmer from Maheshwar. Farmers, however, do have an emotional attachment to farming.Their fortunes depend on many things: rains, prevailing prices, and how indebted they become. Lakhwinder Singh says that the answer to the agrarian unease is either subsidies on input costs or higher prices. He says farmers need to spend not just on farming but also on services like education and health. Unless their expenses go down or incomes go up, discontent is expected, he adds. Everything from health and education to seeds that were public services once are private services now. Farmers get into this loop of rising costs of living, he explains.In Punjab, the government purchases all wheat and rice crops at the MSP. This, being scientifically calculated, can enable farmers to have some incomes that make agriculture meaningful. But the same procurement guarantee applies neither to all crops nor to all States, which makes farming less lucrative as an occupation, says Lakhwinder Singh.Farmers in Madhya Pradesh say that government procurement centres are opened late, often a month and a half after a crop is ready. But farmers cannot store it all in their fields near their homes. They try to sell their crop soon after harvest to merchants, and often get prices below the MSP. If government centres were to start as soon as the harvest came, we would get better prices, says Patidar.The troubles dont end here. Patidar says not all the produce is bought by these centres; it may be rejected on grounds of quality. Suraj, a young farmer from Naraula village in Barwani district, says that there is much paperwork in these centres to ascertain the quantity of land on which the crop was sown, the yield, and to verify that the produce indeed belongs to the farmer who brought it.Unless there is a procurement guarantee and the farmer can count on the government to purchase his produce, the MSP has little meaning on the ground, says former Maharashtra State Planning Commission member and economist H.M. Desarda. Lakhwinder Singh adds that if the government undertakes to purchase all major crops at the MSP, farmers will be better off.But will this not push prices of farm produce bought by consumers upward? Lakhwinder Singh disagrees. He says the large number of middlemen in the supply chain do not anyway let vegetable and grain prices reflect the prices at which farmers are selling them. The long-term answer to farmers indebtedness, he adds, is a rise in their incomes.It may become a heated debate politically, but an answer to non-remunerative farming may take longer to come.Unless there is a procurement guarantee and the farmer can count on the government to purchase his produce, the MSP has little meaning on the ground,H.M.

The Centres role was limited to linking spot market to future market, reforms in essential commodities Act and bolstering food storage and processing sectors.When tomato was being sold at Rs. 7 a kg in A.P., it was sold at Rs. 50 a kg in Kerala the same day. Why are our State markets not integrated. Why cant we have better shelf life for vegetables and fruits. We need to remove restrictions on agriculture market and invite competition between markets, he said.Dr. Chand said a good number of SDGs were directly related to agriculture such as reducing poverty, zero hunger and sustainable use of water.While a new State would tend to grow faster and Telangana apparently was on the right track, it should quickly learn from mistakes of the other States which compromised long-term goals in favour of the short-term ones.He said over-exploitation of water and excessive use of chemical fertilizers would be the pinching factors. Our crop patterns should be linked to water availability. The States should look at different zones and decide on crops that are suitable to specific zones, he said.On decreasing income of farmers, he said though the income might not have risen in 2014-15 and 2015-16, the long-term data showed that the income accruing to the farmers was rising at three % a year. But that was not enough to meet the growing needs and aspirations for better education and health when the rest of the economy was growing at seven to eight %.Unless the farmers income was supplemented by non-farm sources, the agrarian distress would not be alleviated, he said."

And most of the crop, apparently, is withering away though the government says crop in only 7,300 acres is under stress.According to official figures, more than 3.4 lakh farmers seem to have left agriculture for good while the quantum of seed distributed has gone down by over 50%  3.44 lakh quintals  to todays 3.32 lakh quintals.From a high of 5.69 lakh quintals being distributed and 6.32 lakh farmers benefiting in 2009, it went to a low of just over 1.24 lakh quintals and 1.39 lakh farmers in 2014.After slowly regaining some ground in 2015 and 2016, backed by the governments promise of farm loan waiver and the ambitious promise of driving away drought by ensuring a successful crop in every acre through a combination of farm ponds and rain guns, the numbers have started to dwindle again.From the dismal lows of 2014, seed distribution rose by 73.98% (year on year) and the number of beneficiaries by 71.75% in 2015. The next year too registered a 43.6% and 37.5% increase in the quantum of seed distributed and beneficiaries respectively.However, it fell to a 7.1% growth (year on year over 2016) to 3.32 lakh quintals seed distributed and registered a negative growth rate of 17.72% in the number of beneficiaries this year.Given the fact that the acreage of alternative crops  castor, cotton and others including that of perennial crops (mostly horticulture) hasnt crossed the 70,000-hectare mark in any of the past years, it can safely be assumed that well over at least five lakh farmers are not taking to agriculture at all and around five lakh hectares are being left fallow for the better part of the last decade.I have left 15 of my 19 acres fallow this year out. Last year, I cultivated groundnut in the entire area and faced utter failure and debts. So, I shifted to tomato in four acres as it too has fluctuating fortunes at best, said Pulla Reddy, a farmer from the Anantapur rural mandal.Several lakhs of farmers seem to have made similar choices. The rise in the migration of people every year is but mirroring the grave crisis in the agrarian sector.Several farmers are choosing to move away from agriculture as it has become an experiment year after year. Confidence needs to be instilled in the farmers by bringing water for irrigation usage is the only answer, Peddireddy of the Andhra Pradesh Rythu Sangham told The Hindu ."

5a0b5e999855b76bf13ceb0f,Taming inflationary expectations,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/taming-inflationary-expectations/article19338912.ece,2017-07-24,,The Hindu,"The official inflation rate dipped to 1.5% last month, the lowest in almost two decades. Inflation is a politically more sensitive challenge than joblessness for the simple reason that it affects everyone, whether you have a job or not.Indias long-term record in managing inflation has been very impressive when compared with most developing countries. We have never had the bouts of hyperinflation experienced in many Latin American economies or seen even in countries such as Israel. The relatively high double-digit inflation experienced between 2010 to 2013 was an aberration, which had a political consequence. There have been very few instances of such persistent, multi-year, high inflationary episodes in our history. The credit for this goes to the vigilance of the political system and also to effective monetary management. Inflation is after all a monetary phenomenon  more money chasing fewer goods. So, controlling money supply is part of the strategy for controlling inflation.Food prices as indicatorBut inflation is also an indicator of whether there is an excess demand or supply of goods. For instance, with a bumper crop of fruits and vegetables, prices plunge, even though money supply might be unchanged. Indeed, the recent drop in the inflation rate has been caused by a steep fall in the prices of vegetables (-17%) and pulses (- 22%). Conversely, and rather ironically, unseasonal rains in the north have destroyed a large part of the tomato crop causing prices to skyrocket. Food prices, especially of perishables, are notoriously volatile. High onion prices, even if temporary, have caused the downfall of governments in past elections. Food prices are a big component in the determinant of the overall inflation rate based on the consumer price index basket. Keeping them low and stable involves policies such as public procurement and a minimum support price regime. Inflation control thus involves a combination of monetary management along with measures to increase supply of goods (in the medium term) as also anti-hoarding measures or the release of stocks from government warehouses.Even though price stability is an important goal of government policy, it is now an exclusive mandate given to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Last year, in a landmark reform of monetary management, the government officially gave an inflation target to the RBI. Prior to this, the central bank had multiple objectives which included enhancing growth and reducing unemployment, although price stability was undoubtedly paramount. The new paradigm, called the flexible inflation targeting framework, aims for a numerical target given by the government. The main tool to achieve it is by setting the benchmark interest rate. This decision is now taken by the six-member monetary policy committee (MPC), chaired by the Governor. The current inflation target is 4% plus or minus 2%. The MPC is deemed to have failed if for three consecutive quarters the inflation rate falls outside the band.Low inflation pointerWho would have imagined that in the new MPC regime, the first instance of deviation of the inflation rate would undershoot, not overshoot the target? Of course, technically, the MPC has not failed, for the June inflation rate of 1.5%, which is below 2%, may be transitory. However, there are strong indications and forecasts by many economists that point to low inflation in the coming months. Those numbers may be in the range of 2 to 4%.How did we get to this low inflation scenario? Partly it must be because the money supply has been kept dear, or tight. Thus, the benchmark rate (called the repo rate, or the rate at which the RBI gives money to banks) at 6.25% may be too high. Interest rates are the price of money, so if they are too high, money becomes scarce. If it is lowered, then there will be more money in circulation, more loans given out. But low inflation is also because of a steep fall in prices of fruits, vegetables and pulses, none of which was caused by high interest rates. These steep falls are highly seasonal. We have also benefited from low and stable crude oil prices, which are a crucial determinant of transport and energy costs.All eyes will now be on the MPC which meets again in less than two weeks. There is a strong feeling that high interest rates have deterred big industrial investments, or housing finance. High rates are crippling borrowers who try to come out of near-bankruptcy and are preventing a restructuring of stressed bank loans. Indias real interest rates, i.e. net of inflation, are quite high even compared to other developing countries. Much of the developed world has ultra-low rates, with some countries such as Sweden, Switzerland and Japan even having negative interest rates. India needs much lower rates for higher GDP growth.But the job of the MPC wont be easy. This is mainly because its task is to target future inflation, not the past. The future has some troubling portents. The short run impact of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is bound to be inflationary. Thats because a bulk of Indias GDP is in services whose tax rate has moved from 15% to 18%. Besides, while sellers wait for their refund, i.e. input tax credit under the GST, their cost of capital locked up might go up. Many State governments have introduced additional levies to counter their apprehension of a loss of revenue under the GST. Besides the GST, there is the impact of the award of the Seventh Pay Commission to government employees. This effect will cascade to public sector organisations and State-level employees as well, and put pressure on prices. A third factor could be the loan waivers announced in some States which can cause fiscal stress. High deficit spending is not compatible with lower interest rates. A fourth factor is the uptick in commodity prices worldwide as metals and food prices are looking up.The last, and probably the most important, factor weighing on the MPCs mind would be inflation expectations. Household surveys conducted by the RBI indicate that people are expecting inflation to be close to 10% , not the 1.5% as is reported now. You may say that these expectations are irrational, but they do affect behaviour. In this season of salary increments, try giving someone a raise of 2%, as is common in the developed world. Workers will howl. Even their official dearness allowance is much higher. The real challenge is to slay this inflation expectations monster. In much of the western world, they are fighting disinflation if not outright deflation. But in India we are still struggling with inflationary conditions and expectations.In English the verb for inflation is inflate. It refers to rising prices. But in most Indian languages, the equivalent word in usage is  mehengaai , which refers to affordability and cost of living. Not all inflation is unwelcome. So if stock prices go up, that is good cheer. But  mehengaai  is hated by all. A low and stable inflation rate is a perquisite for sustained high economic growth. Mehengaai is antithetical to it. In the medium term, the growth impact of the GST, the improving ease of doing business  and hence increasing supply of goods  and a strong domestic currency, will all help keep inflation low. But the short run challenge is to temper inflationary expectations and keep them tethered.Ajit Ranade is an economist"

But their efforts fell through as they could not get credit without providing non-agricultural assets as collateral guarantee, pointed out Executive Director G.V. Ramanjaneyulu of Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (CSA).The 30% tax on farmers cooperative societies was a big dampener and just like the IT sector, there should be a tax holiday for farmers cooperative societies to get them into the market system, he suggested, at a recent workshop on Bangaru Telangana and Sustainable Development Goals attended by government officials and agriculture experts.While the proposed Rs. 4,000 financial assistance per acre to be extended to farmers by the Telangana government was welcome, it would do well to adopt Karnatakas model of having a State-level price mechanism to compensate farmers if prices fell below the floor price. Meagre farm incomes as against rising cost of living, lack of support systems for credit access or for marketing the produce, high cost of production and no commensurate support prices have resulted in growing debt burden and farmers suicides, observed Dr. Ramanjaneyulu.The government, which brought out agricultural action plans, should also be submitting review reports and data related to how many farmers got the credit and minimum support price etc., should be kept in the public domain. And, when prices of vegetables like tomato suffer wide variations from Rs. 1 a kg to Rs. 100 a kg, States should not brook delay in pushing for one country, one market to benefit both farmers and consumers.Farmers have been cultivating only three to four main crop varieties across all areas increasing the risk factor as all areas would not be suitable for all crops, therefore cropping pattern changes has to be crucial. For instance, cotton being cultivated in 40 lakh acres this season could be a risky proposition. Same goes with paddy, a water intensive crop, he says.Dr. Ramanjeyalu also alludes to the fact that TS accounted for the highest fertiliser consumption in the country which means the farmers cost of production has only increased even as the soil health took a hit."

How I came to write about food most of the time these days is a story for another time.But what I realized when I started to write this piece is that the foundations of becoming a food writer were laid down all those years ago.Everyday lunches were about discovering those hidden places in the Gandhinagar area close to my then office. I was a lone lady with a bunch of guys with ravenous appetites and a sense of adventure. And so I discovered the joys of a Jolada Rotti meal one day at a restaurant hidden deep inside a residential area. I've stood in line in front of a tiny place in Seshadripuram for mutton pulav that would be unceremoniously slapped onto a plate and handed to you. You jostled with people crowding the pavement to eat since there was no real place to stand or sit. I also did the rounds of most military hotels in the Majestic region, much before they came into their own today among food enthusiasts. I remember sitting in the midst of all my protective colleagues who wanted me to eat my donne biryani and mutton fry unmindful of all those eyes ogling at a denim clad lady in their midst. I discovered the joys of those Andhra meals and spicy biryanis with these guys too. And during those early morning shoot shifts, breakfasts made of crispy vadas, buttery dosas and sinful idli sambars, complete with a dollop of ghee were mine! These were at places well-known and some so hole-in-the-wall, that you would think people in the know joked of their existence. It was such a way of life that almost every conversation at the end of morning tea at office would center round where we would go for lunch! Discovering the joys of Bengaluru's food scene continued well into my next job - which was as a features journalist. This time, office was close to VV Puram Food Street which made the team actually look forward to those late production nights - steaming masala paddus, gobi manchurian rolls, MLA pesarattu, floating pani poori, gulkhand with fruits, those sinful aloo bajjis and endless cups of chai. Our office boy should have been awarded an honorary degree in journalism for his ability to take orders from everyone and bring them in flawlessly each time. Having a child led me down the freelance path of work and this was a time when I got fed up of doing work based on briefs from other people. I wanted to do something for myself and blogging had just started to be on people's radar. Realizing that I loved to discover new eating places, I started writing about restaurants and eateries.Bengaluru just began moving away from multi cuisine restaurants and began opening up to single cuisine formats. I still remember a lovely place in Koramangala that served only dimsums, much before the current trend of single-dish restaurants came up. Another happy memory is of making my own bruschetta with fresh basil, cherry tomatoes and olive oil served on a platter at an Italian restaurant. Or that time when a friend introduced us to the Laham Mandi, an Arabic version of the biryani served in a basement restaurant in a nondescript corner of Queens Road.With my blog gaining momentum, so did interesting food experiences that came my way - from a meal made entirely from edible flowers, to an Izakaya styled Japanese meal with a live sushi counter, robatayaki and for those on the run - the Bento Box.Gastropubs gave us the first taste of souped-up pub grub - from dirty fries to pierogies to biryani burritos to loaded jacket potatoes and more. Brewpubs had everyone waiting for those seasonal brews to make an appearance, besides the regular favourites. Gourmet coffee cafes are now sprouting, where you can decide on the roast level of your coffee... the scene has never been so vibrant and this is just the tip of the iceberg.Today, I can get myself a nice wine paired (Indian and international mind you) meal, just as easily as I can get sushi, beef carpaccio, ceviche, sour beef and truffle infused just-about-anything.Bengaluru, like the rest of the country is bringing the best of regional Indian cuisine to the fore as well - and so Chettinad, Malabari, Bohri, Punjabi, Rajasthani and more are ours for the grabbing.Indian food, with and without a twist; food served in rickshaws, swings, pressure cookers and ferris wheels . Drinks served in everything found in a science lab Bengaluru has been there, done that and is now coming full circle! Millets are gaining momentum, farm to fork is on the rise, home cooks are setting up pop-ups of regional cuisines that may be lost to posterity , and food is going back to being all about just that good wholesome food.And the best part - I am still eating my way through it all!"

Today, thanks to less production and greater demand, the average rate is Rs 80 a kilo and even an unprecedented Rs 100 is not unheard of.""While there are tomato varieties of lower quality which cost around Rs 80 in the local markets, the best ones are being sold even at Rs 110 per kg,"" says S Siraj Ahmed, a vegetable merchant in Russell Market.The reasons for the spike in prices are not hard to find at the Agricultural Produce and Marketing Committee (APMC) premises at Kolar headquarters, Asia's second largest tomato market. Traders and APMC officials at the yard and farmers in the surrounding villages agree that a combination of a dip in tomato production this season and a sudden rise in the demand for Kolar tomatoes from other states has led to rocketing prices.Kolar APMC secretary T S Ravi Kumar said tomato production in the region had gradually gone down in the past few months due to various reasons  less rain, low pricing and increased temperatures which decreases the yield. ""The supply we receive at the APMC during this season has gone down by 50% compared with last year. At this juncture, the demand for stocks has also gone up from some of the north Indian states where the production has come to a standstill due to flooding and other reasons. As the stocks have become limited, the price of tomatoes has gone up,"" he said.""The price is expected to remain the same or go up further till local production in other states picks up,"" said Toheed Pasha, a trader.Located around 70km from Bengaluru, Kolar headquarters is next only to the tomato market in Maharashtra's Nashik. Apart from Bengaluru, which receives a good chunk of tomatoes from here, the stocks are sold regularly to parts of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and some north Indian states as well. Traders also take tomato loads from here and supply to Bangladesh and Pakistan, among other countries.Kolar a tomato hotspotSrikanth C R from CMR Mandi (primary assembly market) at the Kolar APMC said the best of tomatoes land here from the various taluks in Kolar as well as from surrounding districts like Chikkaballapura, Bengaluru Rural, Mandya, Tumakuru and Chitradurga. ""By good quality, we mean uniform size, required hardness, shining and original red colour in the yield. This is the reason why traders from different parts of the country prefer tomatoes from here. Farmers from neighbouring Ananthpur and Chittoor districts of Andhra Pradesh come here to sell tomatoes as they can get a good number of traders,"" he said."

The skies open up and he pulls a plastic sheet over his head, wondering if he will be working at a petrol pump by this time next year. This isn't a story of urbanisation but of a murder convict being given a shot at reintegration into society.Harilal (name changed) is among a bunch of 24 convicts who have been farming at Thane's open prison . If a proposal made by the prison authorities is accepted by the state government, eight of them could be working as attendants at a petrol pump and car washing centre to be set up in the open prison premises. Prison authorities have written to government-owned oil companies for information about requirements for setting up fuel dispensing units. The open prison at Thane, spread across 20 acres, began operating three years ago. It is the only open prison in Mumbai metropolitan region where convicts can work with no boundary walls. The selection process and eligibility criteria are carefully laid down to choose only the best cases fit for transfer to an open prison. For instance, a committee looks at a con vict's behaviour inside the prison and whether at least a third of his sentence has be en completed. For every ye ar spent in the open prison, the convict get a remission of 13 months in his sentence. But if he is caught fleeing, he would be sent back to the prison and lose his privileges.At Thane's open prison, the largely grey-haired bunch of convicts cultivate land under the watchful eye of an instructor and prison guards.The produce is sold to other prisons. Between April 2016 and March 2017, the Thane facility earned a revenue of Rs 13.4 lakh from the sale of farm produce. ""The group of convicts is involved in every stage of production--from sowing to reaping. We have a tractor and 18 cattle. All kinds of vegetables are grown: tomatoes, brinjals, lady's finger and leafy vegetables like spinach. But during monsoon, we only grow rice,"" the instructor told TOI. After the day's work is over, the convicts return to their barracks within the prison.There are some patches of land that are not under cultivation. It is on one such patch that the authorities plan to instal two fuel units and operate a petrol pump. ""Motorists riding on the stretch from Thane central jail to Rabodi could re fuel their vehicles here. The cash collection will be handled by prison guards. Two convicts would operate a fuel-dispensing unit each and six others would work at an adjacent car wash centre--if things go as per plan,"" said Nitin Vayachal, superintendent, Thane prison. This would be the first time the convicts would interact with the public while still in incarceration; so far their interaction was limited to jail staff.""Open prisons are a good innovation to decongest prisons and facilitate rehabilitation process while the prisoner is still serving a sentence.A step further is open colonies where the prisoner stays in quarters with his family , goes out to farm and sells the produce on his own. He has to be back by a particular time, else it would be regarded as an escape.Prisons in Sangli, Jaipur, etc, have open colonies,"" said Dr Vijay Raghavan, professor, Centre for Criminology and Justice, TISS. Open prisons are only available for prisoners who have been awarded a life sentence or a very long term. ""As to whether society would accept a convict working in their midst, it would depend on the nature of offence committed.Where a murder was a result of circumstances such as land dispute or family dispute and the convict admits he did it in the heat of the moment, it won't attract the same stigma as a case of rape would,"" added Dr Raghavan.The main objective of the penal system being reformation, it is praiseworthy that Thane prison has a plan to ease the shift for convicts after a life of incarceration. The big challenge of the justice system is to prevent an individual from sliding back into a life of crime after a jail term. Criminal recidivism is as high as 60% even in developed countries.Teaching new skills is one way to stem the tide."

An Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) official told TOI that demand for French beans dips in the rainy season."" Because of that, supplies to the markets also come down. Excessive rains tend to affect some crops adversely,"" he said.Yakub Pathan, owner of the Fresh Vegetable Market in Wakad, said French bean prices have been on an upswing for about a month now.""Before Friday, French beans were sold at Rs60 per kg in the retail market. On Friday however, the price doubled, to Rs120 per kg. On Friday, the wholesale markets had no supply of French Beans, which caused the prices to rise,"" Pathan said of the situation.Tomatoes too are being sold between Rs80 and Rs100 in most retail markets. Kailash Kolhe, a vegetable vendor in Koregaon Park, said, ""We buy tomatoes from wholesalers at Rs70 per kg, and sell them at Rs80 per kg. Intense rain spells in tomato growing regions is ruining the crop, apart from making the harvested tomatoes pale in colour,"" Kolhe said. With 50% less supply of tomatoes in the market, the cost of tomatoes has continued to spiral upwards in the last few weeks. With less availability of tomatoes, the prices will continue to remain this way, stated sources from APMC.However, improved production is supposed to bring down tomato prices from mid-August and September.According to sources in the market, during last month's farmers' strike, many tillers had destroyed their standing crop as they were not sure how long the strike would go on for. Incessant rains too played spoilsport, bringing down production. However, the APMC hopes that things would improve and markets would normalize by August.Dilip Khire of Pune APMC added that incessant rains had damaged tomato crops and supply from farmers had depleted, which had caused the prices to rise over the last two months. Gadhve said that Narayangaon, which is one of the largest tomato suppliers, was seeing only 25% supply in the last two months.""There are about 70-80 villages in Narayangaon that supply tomatoes. With less production, we are only getting 200 metric tonne instead of 800 metric tonne of tomatoes during the same period last year,"" he said. He further added that the tomatoes coming from North India, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka have reduced.Meanwhile, vegetable vendor Nanasaheb Awate from NIBM Road said that since the wholesale prices of tomatoes had gone up, he can no longer afford to buy it, and so stopped stocking the vegetable at his stall.""The prices of all vegetables increased during the monsoon and tomatoes are practically impossible to get. For the last three days, my vegetable vendor has not been keeping tomatoes at his stall, so I've not been able to buy,"" said working professional Nina Shah."

Being a backward district, the farmers have been battling poverty here.""The Union government has imposed 18% goods and services tax on pesticides, which is a cause of worry for farmers as it increases the cost of the final produce,"" said Sulaiman, a farmer.The farmers also said that they were not paid the full price of their produces. ""While the tomato is being sold for Rs 90 a kilo in the retail market, a farmer only gets 50 paise a kilo in the mandi.

Though the arguments do not hold water, his customers could scarcely argue and paid accordingly.Mumbaikars were anxious that food prices would rise further once the Maharashtrian-Gujarati Shravan observances began on Monday. But vendors have refrained from escalating the prices of vegetables, which are already on the costlier side with some costing Rs 60-80 per kg, despite the onset of Shravan. Fruits too cost dear with apples priced at Rs 150-180 per kg.Vikhroli fruit vendor Rakesh Gupta of Rakesh Fruits said, ""Shravan and Ramzan are merely excuses for unscrupulous vendors to raise rates in an artificial manner.

They grow vegetables like cucumber, cauliflower, cabbage, beans, bitter gourd, brinjals, ladys fingers, tomatoes and chilly over 400 acres of land in organic manner. Around 300 farmer families are into cultivation and are supplying vegetables to different markets across the State and earning `2-3 lakh each per annum.Rama Chandra Sahoo, who grows vegetables, said farmers have been cultivating vegetables for the last 20 years. Though the district administration has been apprised about provisioning of irrigation facilities for them, the State Government reportedly rejected the proposal stating that project would be very expensive as it is a forest area. With no option, farmers depend on rain or stream water to cultivate the crops. We channelise the forest stream water, which flows throughout the year, to the farm fields to grow vegetables. Farmers cultivate the crops for almost 10 months, while treatment of land is conducted in two months, he said.Another farmer Janeswar Sahoo said earlier, market linkage was a problem, but with the construction of all-weather roads, vegetable dealers are buying the produce from the agriculture field after harvest. It is our source of livelihood and all family members are engaged in farming. We sell the vegetables to the buyers of Bhubaneswar, Athagarh, Cuttack , Dhenkanal and Angul, he added.They said some scientists from National Water Management came to the village and guided the farmers on proper use of natural stream water and better farming.

Tomatoes and spinach were priced at `50 per kg, while brinjal, plantain, ladys finger, ridge-gourd and bitter-gourd sold at `40 per kg. Ginger and garlic were selling at `100 and 60 per kg, respectively, sources said, adding that the price of green chilli came as a surprise at `80 to `100 per kg.Amid the soaring prices, sweet potatoes, cow-pea, pumpkin, radish, papaya, cucumber and some local varieties of greens were available for `20 to `30 per kg. Potatoes came as a major relief, selling at `10 per kg, sources added. Usually, by this time of the year, vegetable prices should have decreased. The crisis can be attributed to the lack of locally-grown vegetables in the markets. I hope the arrival of new vegetables to Rourkela city from Nuagaon, Bisra block, Kuarnmunda and Lathikata blocks of the district besides from adjacent pockets of neighbouring Jharkhand will bring down prices, a local vendor, Subal Barik, said."

The price of almost all vegetables has crossed the Rs 70/kg mark, with the majority now in three figures, in the retail market. Prices of vegetables have increased considerably over the last fortnight , even at wholesale markets.Tomatoes cost Rs 130 per kg in retail and were selling for Rs 85 in the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) complex in Jamalpur. Prices may rise further if demand increases.Several vegetables are have touched the Rs 100 mark or are nearing it. Brinjals are now retailing for Rs 60 a kg. Ladies' fingers, cluster beans and green beans are retailing at around the Rs 100 mark.Deepak Patel, APMC secretary, says, ""The prices of vegetables are skyrocketing because of the heavy rains in the city. Whenever there is a long spell of rains in the state, vegetable prices increase.Once water levels recede in the fields, the prices will stabilize again.""Patel further said that the state at present is banking on tomatoes from Maharashtra and south India. About 25% of the crop has been washed away, and hence there is a shortage in the market. Demand is also increasing, and consequently, so are the prices, said Patel.Against a demand for about 500 10-tonne vehicles, the city is getting only 150 vehicles a day. This is not even one-third of the normal supply, and hence prices are increasing even at the APMC complex. Farmers in the state did not get good prices for their produce earlier this year, and as a result they were forced to throw their crops on the roads. Ghanshyam Devgadia a trader in Memnagar says that prices are likely to further increase in August and September."

The reason they cite is illegal occupation of some sheds in the wholesale market because of which several tomato traders have been sitting on a dharna.""We have been protesting for the past six days and met labour minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday, asking that the illegal occupation of our sheds be stopped. However, we have been given no assurances and on Friday, we will go on strike,"" said Anil Malhotra, general secretary of the vegetable traders' association.On Tuesday, about 2,000-2,500 tonnes of tomatoes arrived at the mandi against a normal arrival of about 12,000-16,000 tonnes. Sources said there was a country-wide shortage of tomatoes due to heavy rain in several states and only produce from Himachal Pradesh was reaching Delhi. ""Tomatoes sold for Rs 70-80 per kg in the mandi on Tuesday, which means that in the retail market, one can expect prices to rise to Rs 110 or even Rs 120 in the coming two-three days,"" warn a trader.While the shortfall was expected, the agitation by tomato traders has resulted in an even lesser arrival of tomatoes, said Metha Ram Kriplani, another trader. ""On July 20, APMC issued notices to companies that have illegally occupied seven tomato sheds and two sheds of mausambi. That is a clear acknowledgement that their occupation of the said sheds is illegal. Despite that, no action has been taken against them till now,"" said Kriplani. ""We want our sheds back and want action against officials who have colluded with the encroachers. Unless the encroachment is removed, we will continue with our strike on Friday.""Minister Rai said that he met representatives of both camps on Tuesday and the best solution that he had for this problem was to reallocate the sheds. ""If one camp is claiming that the other has occupied sheds illegally, then this is how sheds have been occupied in the mandi for years. I have spoken to officials as well and now the allotment will be on the basis on payment of market fees. Space will be allocated in proportion to market fees paid. The same exercise had to be carried out with the potato and onion traders as well,"" he added."

""The Biju Mahila Janata Dal (BJD's women's wing) will stage protest in all district headquarters against the anti-woman move,"" he said. Pramila Mullick, the BJD women's wing president, said the government undertook publicity campaigns to ensure that maximum women use LPG leaving behind firewood. When it became a habit for them, the government now is suddenly withdrawing the benefits so that the oil companies can make money. ""There can't be a worse form of deceit by the government,"" she said. ""We will announce dates of our agitation on Wednesday,"" she said.The BJD members on Tuesday joined the opposition in the protest against the LPG price hike move in Rajya Sabha. BJP spokesperson Sajjan Sharma said the BJD is trying to make political capital against Dharmendra though the Centre's decision will not affect any poor and deserving family. ""Only the rich people who are getting undue benefits of subsidy, like the MLAs, MPs and bureaucrats will have to pay the actual price.""Political insiders feel the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), the subsidized cooking gas scheme for economically weaker sections, is a major reason why the saffron party has been able to made inroads into newer territories at the grassroots. Now, the decision to withdraw subsidizes from the middle class may boomerang, they feel. ""It may become a setback to the momentum gained by the saffron party in Odisha after its impressive performance in the panchayat election in February,"" an analyst said.For the BJD, the move comes as a godsend political weapon. ""It will help bring Dharmendra to a spot of bother at a time when there is constant media scrutiny of BJD's poll expenditure,"" he added.The Samajwadi Party state unit said the Centre's move to hike domestic LPG cylinder price by Rs 4 a month is contrary to the Centre's slogan of 'clean energy and healthy life of women'.

While rates of common vegetables and tubers including tomatoes and potatoes increased by 50% in supermarkets in the city, rythu bazaars too witnessed a 30% hike in prices.On Monday, tomatoes price in a Punjagutta-based hypermart was at Rs. 70 per kilo, while the corresponding price at rythu bazaar was Rs. 60 per kilo. The price of tomatoes in the last week of July was Rs. 50 per kilo. Similarly, baby potato was priced at Rs. 45 per kilo whereas it was Rs. 30 per kilo for the regular variety.Vegetables including ladies fingers and beans were very costly on Monday, with the former priced at Rs. 69 per kilo and the latter Rs. 112 per kg. Onion price, however, was at a constant of Rs. 30 per kilo in supermarkets and rythu bazaars.The weekly budget of most households have gone up, thanks to the price rise even as families tried to minimise spending. In July, there was a sudden price rise which dipped marginally in the last week. But again in August, prices have gone up with essential vegetables costing more than their prices in July, said Venkat Reddy, a resident of Rethibowli, who came to shop at rythu bazaar in Mehdipatnam.Homemakers who manage the household budget said that they have had to make do with lesser vegetables to balance out. We end up buying more tubers than fresh greens. It causes inconvenience to ageing parents who need vegetables more than protein rich tubers, said Vanaja Laxmi of New Mallepalli Colony.Farmers, who brought their produce to the rythu bazar, however, said that their returns declined with consumers buying less than usual.There is a shortage of tomatoes and beans due to poor rains. And then with rains, transportation and storage became a problem, said N. Nagamani, a vegetable seller in Mehdipatnam.Due to fall in prices at the procurement end, several farmers had to dump their produce including rich harvest of tomatoes last month, she said.As the month progresses, the prices are expected to dip as more produce will come from other states including Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, agriculturists predicted.Usually the month of August is when the prices dip with fresh harvest coming in.

All the students are said to be stable now.The girls who consumed hostel food in the evening started vomiting around midnight and they were immediately shifted in 108 ambulances to area hospital by the hostel authorities. It is learnt that they reportedly consumed potato and tomato curry with rice for dinner in the hostel mess after which they began to show signs of uneasiness.Parents of the girls, who reached the hospital after learning about the incident, alleged that the students had been complaining about the hostel mess' poor quality of food for a long time but the management ignored their complaints.According to sources, the students of the gurukul are not happy with the hostel mess food and in the past too such incidents have taken place, but of a lesser magnitude, and the matter was kept a secret. Students told reporters that though they have been complaining about the poor quality of food to the school principal, no action was taken to improve the quality.""Worms are found in the food often. We complained about it to the principal many times but he did nothing. The cook always makes unhygienic food,"" a student said.Though the students were rushed to the area hospital for treatment there were not enough doctors to attend them.

Joint collector and DEO, who also reached the hospital to take stock of the situation, expressed displeasure over the way the hospital was functioning. They pulled up the hospital superintendent for non-availability of doctors in the hospital during night hours.Deputy chief minister Kadiyam Srihari, who also holds education minister's portfolio, expressed anger over the incident and directed his department officials to immediately cancel the contract of the caterers.

5a0dbaa99855b76bf13d115c,Demonetisation and visible hand of market,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/621860/demonetisation-visible-hand-market.html,2017-07-09,,Deccan Herald,"Demonetisation and visible hand of marketKaushik Basu, International New York Times, Jul 9 2017, 23:59 ISTlong term side-effects: Demonetisation failed to do what it was supposed to do, and although the immediate disruption it caused was less severe than feared at first, the policy's impact is turning out to be more protracted than initially expected. nytIn 1776, Adam Smith described the power of the markets invisible hand. Although some economists have since overstated this power, dismissing the role of government regulation, its true that the market, when left to itself, often manages to meet a societys economic needs in ways that no one fully understands. Its a mistake for the state to disrupt it wantonly and for bureaucrats to try to do its job. And thats just the mistake India made last fall.On November 8, 2016, the NDA government suddenly declared that as of midnight that night all bills in denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 would cease to be legal tender. Demonetisation, as the policy is called, applied to 86% of the value of all currency in circulation. It was a state intervention of historic proportion.The goal, the government said, was to eliminate fake Indian currency notes, force people to bring out wealth they had hidden to avoid paying taxes on it  so-called black money  and help India switch from cash to digital money. To counter the criticism that erupted, the government later pointed to other countries that had adopted similar measures in recent times, including Iraq, North Korea and Venezuela.Nearly eight months later, a lot of data is now available to help us assess what demonetisation has actually wrought. Here it is, in a word: demonetisation failed to do what it was supposed to do, and although the immediate disruption it caused was less severe than feared at first, the policys impact is turning out to be more protracted than initially expected.Very little black money has been caught. The truly corrupt hold their black money not as money at all, but as real estate and bank balances abroad. The government had authorised people to trade in up to Rs 4,000 in the cancelled notes, so some parcelled their Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 bills into small bundles and got multiple agents (money mules) to change them, no questions asked. The governments freshly minted Rs 2,000 notes promptly became the new stash currency of choice.In the first weeks, even months, following demonetisation, there was visible chaos. Soviet-era-style queues snaked in front of banks and ATMs. The informal sector  mostly small traders, farmers and small unregistered businesses, which often dont have bank accounts  reeled from cash shortages.But the immediate damage caused, though large, was not as large as some of us had feared. GDP growth in the last quarter of 2016 was 7% and manufacturing activity continued to grow. On the other hand, there may be greater long-term side effects than expected.The problems appeared unexpectedly, when agricultural products arrived on the market. In January, with cash shortages in full swing, demand plunged and food prices collapsed. By February, potato prices in Uttar Pradesh were just over half of what they had been during most of 2016 (at around Rs 350 per quintal, instead of over Rs 600 per quintal).Tomato prices were less than one-third. Onion prices in May were half of what they had been a year before. The cost of onions in India is notoriously volatile  and often influenced by politics and elections  but the likeliest culprit for this years drop was demonetisation.The outcome was curious: Widespread suffering in the midst of plenty. Incomes crashed and distress mounted among farmers, a group in India already affected by high suicide rates because of mass indebtedness. And the downturn has hit more than the farming sector.The Indian economy was on a good trajectory until last year, and the government deserves credit for that. It had taken major steps to cut the costs of doing business and unify taxes on goods and services. With, in addition, the drop in world oil prices (which meant huge savings for India, an oil importer) and the rise of labour costs in China (which made Indian manufacturing and exports more competitive), there was every reason to believe that the Indian economy would soon get back to where it was before the 2008 world financial crisis: growing at over 9% per year. Instead, Indias growth in the first quarter of 2017 was 6.1%, down from 7.9% in the fiscal year 2015-16.Telltale signsAn economy is a complex machine, and there is no way to be absolutely certain that the cause of all this is demonetisation. But there is a telltale sign: Much of the slowdown originated in the financial sector. Rural loans increased by only 2.5% between October 2016 and April 2017, compared with 12.9% a year before. The rate of growth in overall bank credit declined.The growth in industrial output in April was a paltry 3.1%, down from 6.5% the previous April. In the first quarter of 2017, the construction sector actually shrank, by 3.7%, over the previous quarter.All this augurs poorly for the months to come: as the agriculture sector slows down in response to low crop prices and the credit shortage begins to bite, overall growth will likely fall further. The state-engineered shock of demonetisation will continue to course through the economy.Demonetisation did boost the use of digital money, which is more efficient than paper money. But the government didnt need to put 86% of the currency out of circulation to achieve that. Demonetisation was too coarse an approach, and it accomplished too little while causing too much collateral damage.Indias economy has enormous strengths  such as high rates of savings and investment  and this crisis will pass. But just as sailors heading to sea disregard the winds and waves at their peril, economic policy makers cannot ignore the laws of economics, and intervene in the market with a blunt and heavy hand, without risking shipwreck.(The writer, the C Marks Professor of International Studies and professor of economics at Cornell University, was chief economic adviser to the government in 2009-12 and chief economist of the World Bank in 2012-16.)"

At Krishnagiri, the hub of tomato cultivation, bright red ones that filled expansive fields during the abundant harvest shrivelled and died in front of farmers eyes. They had no choice as the market offered just Rs 80 for a 25kg crate (Rs 3.2 per kg).Last Sunday, at the same wholesale market in Krishnagiri, the price had shot up. A 25kg crate was sold for Rs 1,600 and as it made its way through large distributors to wholesalers and finally retail traders, the price hovered around Rs100 per kg for consumers in distant cities.It is the cascading effect of the crisis that had hit farmers at the start of the year that is being felt in kitchens across the State seven months later. It was brought about by a variety of events including glut in the previous season, which was worsened by demonetisation, which led to a severe cash crunch in the market in those months. There was not enough currency available to make any purchase other than essentials.After the drastic setback in winter, many farmers simply refused to cultivate during the next cycle. Few like L Vijay from Rayakottai in Krishnagiri, who went ahead on a half-acre piece of land were hit by the water crisis. He had dug two borewells that went as deep as 1,200ft but found no water. I was forced to buy water at Rs 700 per 6,000 litres, which was used on alternate days to protect my crop.Vijay managed to get a considerable yield but that is a rare success story. Because, as he said, many farmers left without sowing seeds.The effect of this reduction in cultivation was felt in the markets across the western region immediately. At Krishnagiri market, the arrival has dipped to 10,000 crates per day against 40,000-50,000.The sharp fluctuations in price are clearly affecting farmers, markets and consumers, with none having any certainty on how the price would behave at the end of a crop cycle, even if it is only 60-70 days long.There are tomato processing units in Krishnagiri, Kinathukadavu and Tiruchy that the State government is running in association with the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU), said vice chancellor K Ramasamy.According to him, farmers did not follow the announcements that the university made, and sowed without considering the climatic condition and water availability. Such individual cultivation would not help to ensure profitable farming, he said.From this year, following a recommendation by the TNAU, the State government has decided to shift the cultivation method to seedling plantation from sowing seeds. So we hope the cultivation can be streamlined into a systematic manner under the guidance of the State horticulture department.The government is also considering another suggestion by the university on creating 10 marketing societies across the State and introducing mobile processing units to collect the excess produce from the farm itself, he added."

While such an event may not need any medication, it tends to make us spin our gears trying to pinpoint what made us so miserably sick. Reading the clues might reduce risk in the future. NYTIt happens like a bolt out of the blue. One minute youre fine, and the next you begin to sweat as crippling cramps move wavelike through your belly. You vomit or have diarrhoea, or both, fearing you wont live to see another day. And then it goes away. Youre back to your old self, maybe after a day or two of binge-watching Netflix, chasing dry crackers with ginger ale.The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention estimates this scenario, known as an acute gastrointestinal event, happens to all of us at least once a year. The bouts, while extremely unpleasant, usually dont occasion a trip to the doctor or require any medication.But such events tend to make us spin our gears trying to pinpoint what made us so miserably sick. While its hard to know for sure, there are clues that might help you determine the source and reduce your risk in the future. People tend to blame the last thing they ate, but its probably the thing before the last thing they ate, said Dr Deborah Fisher, a gastroenterologist and associate professor at Duke University School of Medicine.It takes the stomach around four to six hours to empty a full meal, and then the small intestine takes about six to eight hours to squeeze out all the nutrients and empty into the colon. The remains linger there for another one to three days, fermenting and being formed into what ultimately is flushed down the toilet. The so-called bowel transit time varies significantly from person to person, but gastroenterologists said you can easily find out whats normal for you by eating corn and watching for when the indigestible kernels appear in your stool.Gross, perhaps, but with that baseline, the next time you get sick, youll be better able to estimate when you might have eaten the offending meal. For example, if you throw up something and dont have diarrhoea or roiling further down, it could be that what made you ill was something you ate within the last four to six hours. If you wake up in the middle of the night with cramps and diarrhoea, its more likely something you consumed a good 18 to 48 hours earlier, depending on the results of your corn test.Most food-borne illnesses are caused by viruses or bacteria, such as norovirus, Staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter, salmonella, E coli and Bacillus cereus. So in addition to figuring out the correct time-frame of consumption, also consider what foods are more likely to be contaminated. Items cited frequently on the Food and Drug Administrations food recall list include leafy greens, culinary herbs, melons with textured surfaces like cantaloupe, fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, jalapeo peppers, nut butters, shellfish, frozen peas, cheese and ice cream.Also suspicious are any foods left out for several hours, like the classic potato salad at the family picnic or fried rice at a Chinese buffet.Restaurant food tends to be riskier in general not only because more hands are involved in the preparation but also because the ingredients are ordered in bulk. A fast-food hamburger could have meat from a hundred different cows, Fisher said, and it takes only one with a pathogen to make you sick. The eggs in your two-egg omelette were poured out of a carton so it could have come from 50 different chickens, she said.Similarly suspect are freshly made juices and smoothies which are extracted from pounds and pounds of produce. Just one speck of contaminated dirt in your detox drink could upend your gut. And think of all the hands that necessarily touched the produce from the time it was picked in the field to when it was chopped and crammed into the Vitamix.Lets not forget about germs on your own hands if youre not diligent about washing them with soap and water. Did you eat or otherwise put your fingers in your mouth after gripping the pole on the subway or after throwing a slobbery ball for your dog? Did you put your mobile phone down on the table at a coffee shop  or on top of the toilet-paper dispenser in a public restroom  and then put it up to your mouth to take a call? Germs that make it into your digestive tract dont always come from food.And sometimes your gut distress isnt caused by a germ at all. It could be an overdose of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, known in public health circles as Fodmaps. These are essentially carbohydrates that, eaten in excess, are not well absorbed in the small intestine and then make their way into your colon to cause all kinds of trouble. They include myriad things were encouraged to eat including broccoli, brussels sprouts, radicchio, asparagus, avocados, mushrooms, peaches, whole grains and legumes.People are trying to eat so healthy these days, but a lot of those things are high in Fodmaps, said Dr Scott Gabbard, a gastroenterologist at the Cleveland Clinic. You could always eat a lot of salad, but on that certain day, that certain combination of fruits and vegetables in your salad was just high enough in Fodmaps that it overrode your systems capability to absorb those carbohydrates and you ended up with something almost like a purging.Gastrointestinal eventsDrugs are also a common source of acute gastrointestinal events. Fisher mentioned the story of an otherwise healthy and active patient who had bouts of GI distress every few months or so. After many tests came back negative, she finally determined it was the ACE inhibitor he was taking to control his blood pressure.A side effect of the drug is that it causes swelling in the intestines so he would get these temporary, partial obstructions, Fisher said. He would vomit and skip a meal and then the swelling would go down. It went on and on until we took him off that drug and now hes fine.Medications used to treat depression, allergies and gastrointestinal reflux can also make you more vulnerable to intense, short duration attacks of vomiting or diarrhoea, or both. Recreational drugs could also be the culprit. Were starting to see more cyclic vomiting syndrome called cannabis hyperemesis because THC content of marijuana now is so high, Gabbard said, referring to psychoactive component of marijuana.Finally, theres stress. Whats going on in your head has an enormous impact on your gut and vice versa. The human brain and nervous system is very intimately mixed with another nervous system that is present in the walls of the intestine, said D Santhi Swaroop Vege, a gastroenterologist at the Mayo Clinic.So instead of something that you ate, it could be youve swallowed your fear, anxiety, anger or sadness and its wreaking havoc on the nerves, chemical secretions and microbiota that keep your bowels operating smoothly. Gastroenterologists as well as psychiatrists said its not uncommon for acute gastrointestinal events to cease or become less frequent after a patient quits a bad job or leaves a bad relationship. Thats why, when making a difficult decision, you might just want to trust your gut."

The current price spiral is remarkable for its suddenness.First, it was tomatoes and now it is onions, whose prices are soaring, much to the discomfort of consumers and policymakers. The current price spiral is remarkable for its suddenness. Only two months ago  that too, during peak summer  tomatoes were retailing at an all-India average of Rs 15 per kg. That rate has quadrupled since, even scaling Rs 100 briefly in some places. Even more striking is that onion, till as late as July 21, was selling below Rs 7 per kg at Lasalgaon in Maharashtra. But today it is quoting at over twice that level in the countrys biggest market for the bulb. The second point to note about the price flare-up now is that it follows a protracted period of low rates for producers. Leaving out the last 10 days or so, onions have been trading in Lasalgaon at below Rs 10/kg since February 2016. Tomato growers were similarly battling Rs 5-6/kg prices from November right through mid-June; they have hardly benefitted from present wholesale prices of Rs 40-plus.There are two reasons for prices going up. The first is the monsoon. Rainfall this time, although normal on the whole, hasnt been as good and well-distributed as in 2016. While Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and even the Marathwada and Vidarbha regions of Maharashtra are facing drought-like conditions, Gujarat and Rajasthan have borne the fury of floods. This has led to delayed plantings or even necessitated re-sowing of the kharif crop in many areas. The immediate impact is being felt in onions and tomatoes, but the effects on other crops  maize, jowar, groundnut, soyabean, cotton  cannot be ruled out. The second explanation may have to do with un-remunerative realisations, post-demonetisation, in most crops until recently. There is evidence, at least in tomatoes, of farmers cutting back on production as a result. The price of that is now being paid by consumers.Going by past record, the Centres most likely response to rising prices would be to impose restrictions on exports (not allowing shipments below a minimum price) and holding of stocks by traders/processors, alongside allowing duty-free imports or even contracting these through government agencies. We saw this in 2014, 2015 and even 2016 in respect of onions, potatoes, pulses and sugar. While being sensitive to the interests of consumers may be a good thing  and also in consonance with the Reserve Bank of Indias inflation-targeting goals  this clearly cannot be at the expense of producers. Like its predecessors, the Narendra Modi government has shown little commitment to the principles of free trade and liberalisation when it comes to agriculture. Hopefully, the promise of doubling farmers incomes by 2022 will lead it to respond differently this time round.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Archive) Summer tomato, harvested between May and July, sees bigger investments by farmers who expect better price realisations. (Express Archive)Speaking of tomatoes, excuse me, why arent we speaking of tomatoes? Theyve reached Rs 100 per kg. Or why arent we crying over the price of onions which has, apparently, spiraled 119 per cent in 10 days (ABP News)? These are seasonal (vegetable) problems, were told. Perhaps. But theyre of far more immediate concern to the public/viewer than politicians who are men and women for all seasons. And dont you remember that Delhis BJP government was brought to tears at the hustings in 1998 by onions?Why not also discuss, debate, expose the abysmal condition of public hygiene and sanitation? When was the last time you didnt see a male or female perform (ablutions) in public  and when, if ever, have you heard a discussion about toilets or garbage disposal or the menace of plastic? The PM cries foul but why doesnt his Mann Ki Baat or the Swachch Bharat advertisements on TV and radio on such fundamental issues make breaking news, headlines or (super) prime time debates? If the price was right, wed throw a few tomatoes at them.Lets not throw any at ABP. On Monday, at prime time, it went on the onion trail from Alwar to Nasik and onto Madhya Pradesh where it found them rotting. They bit into tomatoes too and tried to explain the price rise in both. It was a detailed, in- depth report. Odd that they should be recognised for doing what ought to be routine. More, please.Someone who was pretty red-faced under his skin but did a good job of hiding it is Nitish Kumar. The newly sworn-in chief minister of Bihar for the nth time, was at a televised press conference on Monday, bleeding, sorry, pleading, almost for understanding of the impossible position Lalu & Sons had placed him in. By the time he proclaimed Modi as the winner of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, he looked somewhat crumpled, as if someone had sat upon him.Flashback to October 2015 and recall his stirring campaign speeches we watched during the Bihar assembly campaign when he challenged the PM to beat him in the state. On Walk the Talk (April, 2016, NDTV 247), soon after calling for a Sangh mukt India, he spoke of the BJPs ideology that was potentially poisonous as it divides society; of the need to set aside differences to fight the BJP, etc. What a difference two years makes in politics.If all this worldliness in politics is distasteful and soul destroying, never fear, help is near. Double digit spiritual/religious TV channels are available to salve your disillusioned heart. There are some 20-odd such channels on Tata Sky, including its own devotion channels. More than a dozen of these are related to Hindu spiritual discourse, with Lord Buddha TV, Shalom TV, God TV, Goodness TV for religious diversity. Didnt see one devoted to Islam, which only means that they are not on the popular bandwidths because they do exist.And what on earth is YO TV? No clue, after watching it. Speaking of Tata Sky, it has a bouquet of its own channels which offer education with entertainment and exercise: Tata Sky Fitness, Tata Sky Dance keeps you on your toes, Tata Sky Comedy plays old sitcoms for a laugh, Amitabh Bachchan promises you can learn to act (like him?) on Tata Sky Acting, theres Classic Cinema for those who want to remember when Sunil met Nargis, Tata with Javed Akhtar for the poet in you, Tata Sky Gurus to teach you a few lessons, etcetra, etcetra. Some of it is far superior to what entertainment channels offer.What one of them is offering just now is Pehredaar Piya Ki (Sony TV) in which nine-year-old Prince Ratan marries a woman twice his age, Diya. The age difference would be an emancipating thing for TV soaps but for Ratan being a child groom. They marry in order for her to protect him  again a liberating idea  but decidedly odd and disturbing since surely there are other ways to protect a child? Especially, when Ratan is besotted by her. Its all very absurd, trying to attract viewers by its bizarre premise.On news TV they scream, insult, and say even fake things, to get us to watch them; on entertainment channels they now exploit twisted fantasies.

5a0ddcc59855b76bf13d1a1f,Misplaced Cut,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/rbi-repo-rate-cut-monetary-policy-committee-4785404/,2017-08-07,,Indian Express,"It was the former RBI governor C. Rangarajan who once said: Central banking is an art. It was the former RBI governor C. Rangarajan who once said: Central banking is an art.The decision by the RBIs Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to cut the policy repo rate by 25 basis points, from 6.25 per cent to 6 per cent, marks the first such reduction in eight months. The policy action has received subdued enthusiasm from the market based on expectations that the cut could have been 50 basis points.This has been the way the game is played out in recent times. As a policy date nears, demands are raised and a market expectation is built in favour of a cut that, it is expected, would eventually help lower the lending rate, boost investment and revive growth. However, what is often missed out is that the key link in this chain is the transmission of the policy repo cut to the bank lending rate, a link that by the RBIs own admission stands broken. This is what the RBI has flagged in its statement issued alongside the MPC resolution of August 2. The statement announced the setting up of an internal study group for improving the monetary transmission and exploring linking of the bank lending rates directly to market determined benchmarks.If this is the picture today, the question needs to be asked: Where does the rate cut of 25 basis points lead us? The question is important particularly in light of sustaining the growth rate of 7.3 per cent projected by MPC for 2017-18 (against 7.1 per cent in 2016-17) and keeping headline inflation close to 4 per cent on a durable basis. The growth data for 2016-17 show that Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) recorded a growth rate of 8.7 per cent while the Government Final Consumption Expenditure (GFCE) increased by 20.8 per cent. This tells us that the growth is essentially led by government consumption.The higher consumption expenditure of the government is also seen in the first quarter of 2017-18 in data released by the Controller General of Accounts. For example, revenue expenditure accounted for 31.7 per cent of total budgeted revenue expenditure against 26.7 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year. This resulted in a marked increase in the share of revenue deficit (119 per cent) and fiscal deficit (81 per cent).On the other hand, the private sector is suffering from weak investment demand. This is reflected in a broad based loss of speed in manufacturing, excess inventories of coal and near-stagnant output of crude oil. The problem worsens with lack of traction in the implementation of stalled projects coupled with deceleration in the output of infrastructure goods.Thus, the picture is of continued weak private investment not because loanable funds are not available but because corporate balance sheets are not in a position to fire new capex plans. Banks are themselves straddled with NPAs and have no appetite for corporate lending, particularly at a time when the road ahead with a new insolvency law and the proposed fast-track resolution of NPAs remains unclear. Retail inflation fell to a historical low of 1.54 per cent for June 2017 as a result of two factors: Vegetables (which showed a decline of 16.53 per cent) and pulses (down by 21.92 per cent). One has to only head to the market today to know that these are transitory factors, and vegetable prices are already headed high, led by tomatoes at Rs100 per kg.In sum, the perception that inflation is low, growth is on track and the time is right for a rate cut, is flawed. The letter of the MPC resolution recognises this but the spirit has been one of sailing with the wind of market sentiment and some government pressure. This is seen in the change in stance by the MPC members who voted against the cut in June 2017 but switched this time to a 25 basis points cut. The switch reflects an approach that is inconsistent.It was the former RBI governor C. Rangarajan who once said: Central banking is an art. And it is not surprising that the only career central banker on the MPC is the one who voted not to cut the repo rate this time.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Tashi Tobgyal Azadpur mandi, the largest in Asia, wore a deserted look on Monday. Tashi TobgyalThe usually busy and crammed streets of Azadpur mandi wore a deserted look on Monday evening as a section of fruit and vegetable traders shut shop. Complaining of corruption in the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC, Azadpur) and encroachment of some sheds by new traders, a group of old-timers sat in protest under a tent. Tomato trader Puran Chand, 59, said, Ive been in this business for 30 years. On June 20, my area was illegally occupied by another firm Im suffering major losses. Another tomato trader, 50-year-old Tilak Raj, recounted a similar tale: I have barely bought two boxes of tomatoes since June 20 Ive told the labourers to find a job elsewhere because I have no work to give.While some of the traders organised a dharna on July 19  with a few sitting on a two-day hunger strike  many closed their sheds on Monday in protest. Stating that closing the mandi meant incurring a loss of Rs 30-40 crore daily, Anil Malhotra, general secretary of Azadpur Vegetable Traders Body, said, We demand that the sheds be given back to those who won the bid We also demand insurance for wage labourers and a proper security system, as well maintaining cleanliness in the area.He added, Initially, they (the committee) would accept cheques for market fee payments. Now we can only pay online Every trader is not well-versed with this; how can they force us? Sources in the Delhi government, meanwhile, maintained that the vegetable mandi was in fact open, while the fruit mandi was partially shut. A source said, This was a politically motivated non-strike the Delhi government will not bow down to blackmail.Reacting to accusations by the traders, Satnam Singh, secretary, APMC (Azadpur), said, The issue is of allotment This faction did not let the new allotment of sheds happen in 2016. They dont want reform, which is why theyre also against online payment of market fee. The country is moving towards digitisation but they dont want to. He added, As far as cleanliness is concerned, this is a 24X7 mandi and we do our best. The corruption charges are also baseless.While the traders have called off the strike as a meeting is scheduled with the APMC on Tuesday, they added, If our demands arent met, well shut down all four mandis of Delhi, go on a hunger strike and block Adarsh Nagar Metro station.For all the latest Delhi News, download Indian Express App"

With the aim of teaching gardening skills and waste management, this group has conducted more than 1,500 workshops. We help people start gardens on their terraces, and also train them in how to maintain these gardens through visits and consultations, says 25-year-old Mani, a software engineer.When asked what made him take up gardening, Mani says, It was back in 2012, we were witnessing a new era in gardening. Everything was polluted and contaminated, from the food we consume, the air we inhale, the water we drink and the soil as well. My passion started with several unanswered questions, such as, how to grow an organic garden? Which season is best for more yield? Can I grow vegetables by myself?He adds that they make a difference in the way urban citizens think about gardening, only when there is passion, is when we start questioning and start learning. We started My Dream Garden, as part of Imagine Enterprises and Marketing Solutions, with a passionate team to make people aware and encourage them to grow organic plants, he says.Mani says he mainly grows vegetables, herbs, fruits and a few flowering plants. He says that his favourite plant to grow are tomatoes, as they are beautiful and because its life cycle resembleshuman life.He says that he doesnt like to grow plants that arent suited to Indias climatic conditions, but that he likes to experiment anyway. One vegetable that he has been wanting to grow is lettuce, as it makes the garden beautiful and is healthy for meals as well.He adds that no one has inspired him as such, and that nature itself has been a source of motivation. Nature itself has inspired me the most. My childhood was spent with plants in my native place in Mulbagal, Kolar, he says.Sharing some useful tips on how to maintain a good terrace or kitchen garden, Mani says, Make sure plants get enough sunlight, that the containers are appropriate, that watering is done via sprinkling until germination happens, application of vermicompost or home compost once a week is a must, the use of bio nutrients such as plant meal, bio enzymes, seaweed extraction make for better crops, an organic pest management solution using chili, onion, garlic and ginger paste is ideal, he says.Mani adds that regular pruning and crop rotation is essential."

The country is in the midst of a severe food oversupply, say experts, and farmers are selling their produce for prices less than what they spent growing them.It is also a reflection of demonetisation, when farmers did not have cash to buy seeds for Rabi season. The lack of resources, borrowed money, bumper crop and low demand reflect todays inflation numbers and farmers distress, says economist Arun Kumar.Painting a further grim picture of the economy, factory output for the month of May grew at a meagre 1.7 per cent, compared to 8 per cent last year.The subdued growth in manufacturing is worrying as some major sectors like capital goods, automobile and textiles have shown degrowth. This underlines the need for major reforms to improve the investment climate, said industry body FICCI secretary Didar Singh.It was food prices, that have a weightage of 49 per cent in inflation calculation, which brought the overall numbers down. Vegetable prices are in negative territory for the 10th straight month and pulse prices for the 7th straight month on yearly basis, says Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Adviser, SBI in report.Low inflation is not necessarily a good sign in the long run, says Seema Sharma Economist at IIT Delhi. More so because current numbers fall below the Reserve Bank of Indias tolerable levels that ranges between 2 and 6 per cent.It is a bad sign RBI will not be guided by June numbers, but by what happens in July, because it is the first month of GST and it will try to examine the impact on economy. Its likely that RBI may hold current rates, said Kumar, indicating that the new tax regime might make a repo rate cut unlikely.The government, however, has a different perspective. It feels these are reflections of a consolidation process in the ongoing macroeconomic activity. The number of 1.54 per cent is historically low and reflects the firm and ongoing consolidation of macroeconomic stability, Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian said.Tomatoes, however, defied economics with prices skyrocketing above `90 in Chennai. Traders blamed it on demand in Andhra and Karnataka."

Chanho circle officer Pravin Kumar Singh said the death is being investigated by police and that the victims family was handed Rs 3,000 in cash by the BDO as per the norms of a family benefit scheme.He was the sole earning member of our family. He was very worried for the past one month as he did not have money needed to carry on paddy cultivation on our 2.5 acres of land. He was also worried for having no money to pay for the education of his sisters, said Chandu Munda, the victims differently-abled father.Sanjay, the only son of his parents, had been funding the education of his three teenage sisters from his meager income from agriculture and odd jobs. The eldest among the sisters, Ritu, is a first year BA student at a local college. Their mother, Phool Kumari, expired two years ago.He grew tomatoes, cabbage and other vegetables this year, but was distressed as he did not get proper price for the produce. We see no hope for our lives without him around, said Ritu.Opposition Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik) (JVM-P) leader and former CM Babulal Marandi visited the grieving family and urged the Raghubar Das-led government to take steps to prevent more farmer suicides. Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) general secretary Vinod Pandey demanded that the government should ensure free education for the victims three sisters.It is still under investigation whether this death is a suicide or murder, said Deepak Prakash, general secretary of Jharkhands ruling BJP.On June 26, debt-ridden farmer Domna Oraon, of Lohardaga district, committed suicide by consuming pesticide. Baldeo Mahto, a farmer from Pithoria block in Ranchi district, killed himself by jumping into a well on June 15. Kaleshwar Mahto, another debt-ridden farmer from the same block, hanged himself from a tree on June 10. Rajdip Nayak, a farmer from Ormanjhi block, killed himself by consuming pesticides on July 2 allegedly due to harassment by bank officials for repaying loans."

The restaurant has introduced a new menu that includes signature Italian dishes and exotic ingredients. For starters, we were served Fungi misti e Formaggi, Chicken crostini and Calamari, acciughe e fritti di Gamberi.Fungi misti e Formaggi is a platter of mushrooms mixed with fresh greens, walnuts, broccoli and cheese. It has the nutty flavour of walnuts, bitterness of blanched broccoli and the earthy flavour of grilled mushrooms, and comes with an Italian dressing. The Chicken crostini has grilled pesto chicken, olives, onions, bell peppers on a crunchy Tuscan bread served with mixed greens. The olives neutralises the cheese. Smothered in a creamy, basil pesto, it brings out the char-grilled taste of the chicken. It serves as a comfort food.The Calamari in Calamari acciughe e fritti di Gamberi is crunchy and chewy. The crispy soft prawns in the platter goes well with the dip. It is served with french fries and salad. To cleanse our palate, an intermediate course of fruit sorbets topped with mint leaves are served. Next comes the main course. The Risotto aifunghi misti e porri has mushrooms blended with leek risotto prepared with truffle oil. Warm and starchy, it is healthy and makes you feel good. It's a dish that you can have during the rains. The Chicken scaloppini has thinly sliced chicken breast with truffle-flavoured mushroom wine butter sauce, grilled mushroom, tomato and buttered creamy spinach.The platter has garlic mashed potatoes and rosemary grilled veggies that includes broccoli, beans and cauliflower. The mashed potato is a favourite. Even people who do not prefer potatoes, would love it. It has a dominant pungent taste of garlic.The Burro di Dory e aranciapan is a fried polenta crusted John Dory fish with lemon couscous, spaghetti of vegetables, tomato salsa and orange butter sauce. The dish is not bad but it did not meet our expectations.The fish looks crunchy but is not. The vegetables in the noodles adds crunch to the dish. It has grainy Mediterranean khus khus. The desserts are the highlight. The Salted Vanilla Cheese Cake is the best of the lot. It looks so colourful and appealing that you don't want to disturb the presentation. Served with ice cream, the cheesecake platter also has strawberry sauce. Most Americans prefer to have the cheesecake topped with this sauce.But, people here might not take to it and, hence, it is served on the side. The Chocolate, Banana crepe is nice. The thin crepe is smooth. It is caramelised right. The chocolate sauce does not overpower the taste of the banana. It is served with almond Praline and Vanilla ice cream. The Strawberry and Chocolate Ganache Tart has crumbs of red velvet. It is buttery. The outer layer of the tart, made of bisuits, adds a creamy crunch to it. Cost for two: `1,500"

The edible portion of the plant consists of the flower buds before the flowers come into bloom. These are inedible in older, larger flowers.Today, cultivation of the globe artichoke is done only in a few countries and the main European producer is Italy. Apart from its use in food, the globe artichoke is also an attractive plant for its bright floral display, sometimes grown in herbaceous borders for its bold foliage and large purple flower heads.While working for Celler (The Fusion Restaurant) Civil Aviation Club - Dubai, we were trying many ingredients, finding Jerusalem Artichokes was very difficult and hence we landed with Italian Artichokes which turned out to be very relishing and refreshing. We made a salad out of it called as Braised Artichoke Salad, ingredients were artichokes, roasted green tomato, arugula, snow peas, feta cheese, roasted pine nuts, dressed sherry vinegarette.The flavour of the Italian Artichoke is mild, tastes a little nutty and is quite tangy. It is also soft, tender and juicy. The challenge is the ingredients itself, as there is no cultivation in our country but it is available online.

The new menu, which is for only a month at Smoke House Deli, offers six varieties of meats. There is the one Roasted Chicken and Classic Sauce Supreme and Potato Cake, which is served with potato, mushroom, tomato, cream and cheese. Chicken is juicy, abounding in creamy flavours of mushroom while the skin remains delightfully crisp.The potato cake layered with thin slices and sandwiching cheese and egg oozes, when cut, to compliment the fibrous chicken. Boiled tomato gives the meal an acidic twist. Grilled Rib Eye steak, with beef, is served with carrots and asparagus tossed in butter. The ribs are directly grilled without marination so the mild flavour of the meat is retained. Sauce Robert, a brown mustard sauce, is poured over the beef and the brown sauce tastes sharply of onion and butter, the two primary ingredients of Sauce Robert.The meat is hard and chewy, with a sour cream topping the taste balances out. Now onto the Pan Grilled Quail served with Spaghetti Chicken Bolognaise; expect an attractive presentation. The roasted quail nestles on classic spaghetti. The first bite is smoky and bitter and the taste lingers to turn sweeter. Quail tastes like chicken but the flavour is stronger. Minced chicken tossed in spaghetti and harmonised with zesty red wine makes this delectable.Almost similar in style but distinct in flavour is the Pan-seared breast of Duck and Soya Chilli Noodles that bursts with flavours of chilli and garlic. The tangy orange sauce has been tossed with noodles along with chunks of orange. Over this is placed glazed and juicy duck meat. The salad served to the side has lettuce, barley and duck feet, a refreshingly new combination.Besides the bird variety, Crumbed Lamb Cutlets and Mint Pesto is another surprise because this is the only meat in the menu that is fried in butter and not grilled. Caramalised, juicy and crisp, the lamb is cooked to perfection. Grilled Fresh Pork Chops with Home-made Hash Brown is shallow-grilled pork ribs and is medium-rare. The chewy and salty flavour of the pork meshed well with smokey cake-like Hash Brown. Cost for two: `2,000"

Kolkata is known for its trademark roll, a sumptuous snack where chicken or mutton pieces sauted with onions and masala are rolled inside a layered and flaky paratha, and served wrapped in thin paper. The snack was conceived by a small restaurant named Nizams near Hogg Market, Kolkata about eighty years ago, arguably as food to be consumed on the go.Initially it was known as kathi roll, because kebabs inside the rolls were charcoal grilled on wooden sticks or kathi. However, over the decades, as the snack became increasingly popular and roll centres mushroomed all over the city, partially cooked meat finished on a tawa started mostly being used instead of kebabs. A large variety of rolls have evolved in the last couple of decades with eggs added to the paratha, and a vegetarian version using potato or paneer as stuffing. The trend of using tomato or chilli sauces in the filling have also become common, much to the dismay of a puritan like me. One of the reasons of popularity of this street food is that it can serve as a utility lunch, evening snack or dinner. You can customise your roll by adding more layers to it, starting from a simple chicken roll and scaling up to the double egg double chicken version.It is fascinating to see a Kolkata style roll being prepared right in front of you. Freshly rolled out layered and flaky paratha is fried in oil on a tawa. For an egg roll, egg is added on the paratha while frying. The filling is prepared separately with meat, onion, optionally veggies like capsicum or cucumber, and a masala  for the last one many shops have their own proprietary versions. Then the paratha is deftly rolled with this filling, and sauces, lime, chopped chillies and dry masala added as per customer specification.In Hyderabad, the Kolkata style rolls have been popularised by Roll Call, that started as a kiosk selling rolls in Madhapur from 2002. They now have roll centres all over the city. Jayeeta Majumdar Singhee, one of the partners at Roll Call mentioned that apart from the authentic rolls from Kolkata, they have also introduced spicy versions like Chicken and Paneer 65 rolls for the local Hyderabadi palate. Overall, they have around 30 variants of rolls with versions like cheese rolls, seekh kebab rolls and reshmi kebab rolls and the rolls are also easy on the pockets priced at `50-100 range. Roll Durbar in Gachibowli, Amantran in Domalguda and Kolkata House in Kondapur are some other places to enjoy Kolkata style rolls."

The BKRG comprises of a group of Kochi natives, engaged in different vocations, who intervene in public related issues and aim to make the city a better place. We have decided to spread this campaign to Thiruvananthapuram and other parts of the state as well, said Gopakumar.He said their campaign was inspired from a Japanese movement in which the people boycotted anything that shows an unnatural increase in price.The campaign which started on July 22 is likely to continue till August 15. Till we see a decline in the price of tomatoes to Rs 50 per kg. The campaign waspropagated through Whatsapp. A similar price hike is seen in other food items like green chillies and chicken as well, he added.Gopakumar said Kochiites should either completely stop or minimise consumption of tomatoes just for a few weeks.This will have a demoralising effect on those hoarding the vegetable. It will in turn bring down the price within a week or two. If we stand united, we will be able to ensure the campaign is a huge success, he added.Meanwhile, the price of tomato came down to Rs 85 on Monday from last weeks price of Rs 110 per kg. While many have turned to other alternatives some still buy tomatoes, though in smaller quantities. Tomatoes are an essential ingredient in every dish we make whether its is sambar or rasam. The price hike last month has affected the middle class, said Jisha K, a housewife.Recently, the Union Government had pointed out that the price hike of tomatoes is only a seasonal phenomena. It also warned the state government to conduct regular inspections to prevent artificial storage and supply of stock. The vegetable vendors said the supply from the northern states has dropped sharply due to rain. It is estimated 70 per cent of the tomato crop has been damaged due to excess rain."

Since more than two decades, places like Universal Bakery as well as King and Cardinal in Himayatnagar have had loyal clientele feasting on their indigenous Hyderabadi burgers. A significant twist in the local burgers is that they usually have no patty in between the buns, instead there is minced meat, dollops of mayo, tomatoes and cabbage.However, it is the vegetarian tawa burger from a small outlet in Ranigunj which is recently making waves in the twin cities. Premium Tawa Burger from Shalimar Tiffin and Snacks is so much in demand that people travel from Hi-Tec City all the way to Secunderabad for it. The patty-less cheesy burgers prepared on a tawa use a totally indigenous recipe, and are extremely mouthwatering. And to top it all, it is light on the pocket costing only `90.The burger recipe is a brainchild of Dilip Mor, the proprietor of this pure vegetarian tiffin center, located opposite the well-known City Lights Bakery. While his shop is more than two decades old, he started selling burgers only in 2011. Three years back, he began making the Premium Burger, and ever since then there is no looking back for him. He uses a proprietary recipe with a special mystery chutney prepared by the family. Also once stuffed, the whole burger is finally rolled in a buttery masala giving it a special taste.You can see the burger being prepared on a tawa right in front of you.A lot of vegetables like capsicum, tomatoes, coriander leaves and chillies, as well as abundant paneer and cheese is sauted on the tawa with a specially prepared proprietary red chutney to make the stuffing. Two kinds of cheese are used  processed and cheddar. This filling is then stuffed inside a soft bun, but unlike conventional burgers the process does not end here.A second round of cheese based masala is again prepared on the tawa, with butter, a dry powder having garlic and ginger as well as the special chutney. After this the burger is actually rolled in this greasy masala, for a buttery look. As you dig into the burger, it gives a right balance of spices and flavours, and of course a lot of cheese.Shalimar also has a regular burger priced at `60 with the stuffing of mashed potatoes. They also recently introduced a mini version of the premium burger for those with a small appetite. The burger does not get soggy even after a few hours, and such is the reputation of this place that customers carry it to other Indian cities and even Dubai, and this street food center has a special flight packaging for this.

My chauffeur Tim had a lovely dog Brady, who insisted on taking the ride with me. We raced on the streets, as Bradys fur gently caressed my cheek. We drove past the Castle of Good Hope (built in the 17th century, it is the best-preserved example of a Dutch East India Company fort), Houses of Parliament and the Companys Garden (created in 1650s by the first European settlers, it is a park and heritage site).Then we headed to Sea Point, Cape Towns most affluent and densely populated suburb. At Camps Bay, another affluent suburb, we took a break to enjoy the scenic ocean vistas as Brady ran and played on the beach sand.Then happened Bo-Kaap. It is the prettiest neighbourhood in Cape Town with houses that are swathed in loveliest colours, standing on romantic cobbled streets from the 18th century. It is neither upmarket nor is it a posh quarter of Cape Town filled with mansions.But it seemed to be the most photogenic place where houses were like colourful birds perched in a row. The Bo-Kaap, formerly known as the Malay Quarter is situated on the slopes of Signal Hill above the city centre. It is the traditional home of Cape Towns Muslim population since the second half of the eighteenth century. The houses are a mixture of Cape Dutch and Cape Georgian architectural styles and this, combined with the Islamic faith, culture and eastern origin of the majority of its inhabitants, give the Bo-Kaap a setting that visitors find both captivating and exotic.Descendants of indentured labour brought by the Dutch from various Asian (mostly Malaysia and Indonesia) and African countries, during the 16th and 17th centuries, these slaves were generally called Cape Malays, though not all of them were of Malaysian origin. When the British took over Cape Town from the Dutch in 1795, the slave trade was abolished. When their slavery ended, they acquired religious freedom and the newly emancipated slaves formed a new community at Bo-Kaap. The founders of this community were the first to bring Islam to South Africa.Intermarriages between slaves from East Indies with those from India, Madagascar, and native African groups created a distinctive Cape Malay culture. It is said that many local women converted to Islam and married Muslim men, as they are teetotallers and made trouble free husbands. People in the Cape Malay community speak mostly Afrikaans and English, with Malay words and phrases thrown in. Bo-Kaaps multifaceted heritage is reflected in its music, dance and food too.Adaptations of traditional foods such as tomato bredie, bobotie, sosaties and koeksisters which are the staples in many South African homes originated from Cape Malay cuisine, which in itself is a fusion of many cuisines.Bo-Kaap Kombuis (Kitchen) is a place everyone recommends for an authentic Cape Malay meal. Their starters reminded me of home: samosas (just like our alu samosas), rolls, dalchies (similar to Indian spinach and moong dal pakoras), and patatawaras (like our batata wada back home). The Indian influence in the main courses too is evident due to generations of widespread intermarriage and union between the two communities.Yusuf Larney runs the joint with his wife Nazli who is a third generation Indian from Gujarat while Yusufs great grandfather came from Ireland. His forefathers married people from the Eastern countries and were integrated into Cape Malay culture. Speaking of Bo-Kaap, he said 90% of the population here is Muslim while the other 10% are Christians, Hindus and Indians. We all live with absolutely no conflict, it is the safest area in the whole of S A. We welcome inter marriages. We respect each other: we believe in sitting across the table and talk to each other first to sort out problems than first go and kill each other.I took a stroll down the road, feasting my eyes on every house. As we walked along, JP threw light on the brightly coloured houses on either side of the street, which, he said, is a recent innovation that celebrates the districts Muslim identity. In earlier days, all the houses of Cape Town were painted white. Then the residents of Bo-Kaap began painting their houses in vivid colours in preparation for the celebration of Eid. Neighbours would often agree on what colours to use so as not to have a clash of shades - in fact, the colours complement each other and act as landmarks as well. But sometimes, to outdo others, some clever residents paint their house a different colour overnight and surprise the neighbours!Of course, the last statement seemed a big joke, his own fiction, like most guides of his ilk. His jokes were often followed by his huge guffaws and gurgling laughter, hinting us to take the cue. JP made our Cape Town visit a huge fun, in fact, as huge as his enormous frame!(The author is a documentary filmmaker and travel writer; she blogs at ijayaprataptravelandbeyond.com)"

As a south Indian, it felt home on taste-buds.The desserts included chocolate delice, pistachio ice cream and poached pears.The Dubai Food Festival saw immense participation from food vendors and foodies alike. Among the most popular stalls was Kaak Al Manara, a Lebanese joint on Jumeirah Road. Its most sought-after dish was Kaak, a bag shaped, dairy free, vegan bread made of wheat flour and sesame. Its founderZiyak Ayaz was the first to introduce Kaak in Dubai two years ago at the Ripe Market and has diversified the simple bread into various flavours of which the authentic pickle and spread salty cheese topped with sumac was our favourite.Other dishes on demand include Polish sauteed mushrooms on a bed of tomato sauce topped with cheese. Not to be bowed down, the Emirati dishes were making their presence felt during our journey with servings of lugaimat, a sweet delicacy with soft filling inside and a crisp doughnut like crust on the outside, and a master class by Queen of Arab Kitchen, chef Manal Al Alem, who took us through the preparation of fireed (vegetables cooked in meat broth), majboos (rice and chickpea with a whole chicken fillet), and a deep-tasting shrimp soup namedrubiyan and of course fruit salad with custard.

Except for apple and orange, other fruits and vegetables are procured from these groups.""The stall that opens at 11 am has many takers. The fruit bowl has pieces of kiwi, pineapple, orange, apple, pomegranate, mango and papaya. The stalls also provide vegetable cut pieces too, says Rageela F, one of the stall keepers. ""The response is good as many of the women employees buy not only fruit bowls but also vegetables needed for avial and sambar. Plantain stem and bitter gourd are also available here at a reasonable price. We have also received a request to provide a salad set which will include cucumber, carrot, onion and tomato,"" adds Rageela.Harikishore says they have a plan to expand the project to include other districts also besides adding new types.

Outside food , cigarettes and tobacco packets are being taken inside the jail with impunity.When this reporter visited the district jail premises on Tuesday evening between 4.30pm and 5.30pm, which is a visiting hour, the visitors were seen carrying all sorts of food items. Interestingly, each visitor was carrying food items in huge quantities which can be served to at least four to five people.One person had come with pundi (rice dumpligs), parottas and chicken sukka. Another person had come with mutton dry, parotta, dosa, fish fry and rasam. Three youths carried a bag containing several kilograms of potato, tomato, cabbage, onion, beans, cucumber and huge amount of spices and masalas inside the jail. However, one thing that was common among all the visitors was that each one of them was carrying packets of cigarettes and other tobacco products. The guards present at the gates allowed these items only after a thorough inspection.A guard, who was present at the jail entrance, pointed out that supply of outside food and number of visitors has increased substantially after the Bantwal communal incidents.""No food items can be taken inside the jail premises as per the prison manual, and tobacco, alcohol and cigarettes are a big no no,"" says S P Chengappa, senior advocate and president of Mangaluru Bar Association.He adds that certain foods can be served to a convict or undertrial only if the court permits it on the recommendation of the doctors. He added that officials in the district jail have not learnt a lesson even after several untoward incidents including murders took place. ""The situation inside the jail has gone out of control. Prisoners possess mobile phones and are in constant touch with the outside world,"" he added.A retired jail official, who served in various capacities in Mysuru and Bengaluru jails, pointed out that ganja smuggling was rampant inside the jail and no officer could stop it till date.When TOI contacted Vijay R, in-charge jail superintendent of the district jail and drew his attention towards food and tobacco products being taken into the jail, he remained tight-lipped. ""We are trying to curb tobacco supply inside jail in a phased manner,"" he said.Currently, the district jail houses over 400 persons including a dozen female undertrials as against its capacity of 210. There are many factions among the prisoners and they often clash with each other."

He grows more than 10 varieties of vegetables and fruits, including beans, tomato, bitter gourd, snake gourd, pomegranate and guava. He runs a retail outlet for organic products (Iyal) and says that the number of stores selling organic products in the city has increased by 25 % in the last three years.For the stores in the city, organic fruits and vegetables also come from places such as the Nilgiris, Kannivadi, Pudukottai, Dharapuram, Hosur, and Erode.Though awareness and consumption are relatively higher in cities such as Chennai and Bengaluru, it has increased here too, he says.According to Shantha Ramasamy of Sreevatsa Organic Farm Products, organic produce normally remain fresh for a longer time. The cost depends on the weather of the location where the produce is grown. Not just fruits and vegetables, even value-added products are going organic. When the demand for organic products increase, the farmers stand to benefit, she says.A.R. Selvaraj, an organic farmer who also runs a store, says that organic fruits and vegetables from this region are sent to cities such as Madurai, Trichy and Chennai too. For the last few months, awareness has improved about organic milk, he says.Awareness among people regarding the health benefits of organic foods has escalated in the past five years, says Rajesh Keerthi, who runs an online organic store. Though the cost is on the higher side, customers go for it considering the health benefits.Availability and affordability are the main drawbacks when it comes to buying organic vegetables and fruits regularly. Small local farmers often use organic methods but sometimes cannot afford to get their farms certified as organic. If the prices reduce, sales and consumption would increase and it would benefit the farmers, says S. Manoj, a regular customer of organic products."

Gomathi of Periyar Nagar in Erode. Dependence on non-vegetarian food has increased in the past one month from weekly once to thrice. We have to work on cost cutting measures for a balanced budget, she says.From tomatoes and small onions to even the fresh greens, prices of most vegetables are up across the region. It is the result of a combination of factors, say farmers, traders, and officials. Failure of monsoon last year and demonetisation had an impact on sowing, they say.Dharmapuri, Salem, Namakkal, Coimbatore and the Nilgiris are among the main horticulture crop growing centres in the State.Over 3,500 hectares are under tomato crop in the blocks of Mecheri, Kaadayampatti, Omalur, Pethanayakkanpalayam, Attur in Salem district. Small onion is raised in more than 4,000 hectares in Namakkal district and about 700 hectares in the Kolathur, Vazhappadi and Gangavalli blocks in Salem district.Repeated failure of monsoon resulted in standing crops withering in many parts, leading to fall in the arrival in the uzhavar santhais and open markets, say officials in Salem and Namakkal.Three kg of tomato was priced at Rs. 10 in May and now it is Rs. 60 - Rs. 64 a kg. During the peak season period, the uzhavar santhais used to receive about seven tonnes of tomatoes every day. Currently, about five tonnes of tomatoes reach the market.Following the commencement of small onion harvesting season in Salem District, there has been reasonable increase in the arrival of onion stock from the villages. The price of small onion which stood at more than Rs. 100 per kg last month, has come down. The price of good quality small onion stood at Rs. 84 and the second quality onion at Rs. 80 at the Salem Uzhavar Santhai on Sunday. The prices of tomatoes and small onions are expected to stabilise in the Salem wholesale markets once arrivals start from the nearby cultivation pockets.The shortage of rainfall and demonetisation seem to have played into the cropping area in Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts. Bathalahalli is the largest wholesale market that attracts traders from across the State and sends vegetables to Kerala too. The general fall in production of vegetables in Thally, Denkanikottai, Hosur and Rayakottai  whose farmers are the largest suppliers of cabbage, tomatoes, beans, carrots, beets, is one of the reasons for the price rise. The supply has fallen, but the demand has increased, say traders.President of Traders Association of Bathalahalli market Raja Reddy says the number of trucks loading vegetables is between 80 to 100 tonne on any day and it has remained almost the same, subject to availability of vegetables. The price of most vegetables range from Rs. 50 to Rs. 60 per kg. Beans has been going at Rs. 50 per kg for the last 6 months, he says. This year, tomato cultivation fell significantly. Its price at the market is Rs. 70 per kg, he adds. Normally, June- August witness a rise in tomato prices largely coinciding with the fall in the vegetables production in other growing regions of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.The 70-day crop was hit right when demonetisation came. Farmers, who were already mid-way into the crop and awaiting harvest, were hit. To cut down on costs, the area of cultivation was also reduced, says a Rayakottai-based farmer.In the Nilgiris, though the prices of vegetables such as potatoes and tomatoes remains extremely high, English vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, beans and beetroot, which are produced in large quantities in the Nilgiris, have not seen a steep hike in prices.According to Raja Mohammed, a wholesale vegetable supplier, the wholesale rate of broccoli currently is Rs. 130 per kg., while carrots are sold for anywhere between Rs. 35-40 per kg. depending on the quality and freshness of the produce. Beetroot is also selling for between Rs. 28 to Rs. 35 per kg., which is the usual price that these vegetables are sold for during this season.The price of English vegetables increase only during the wedding season, when they are purchased in large quantities for feasts, he says. Though the prices of vegetables such as tomatoes and potatoes are still high, there has not been a major demand for cheaper alternatives, said other vegetable sellers in the Ooty Municipal Market.(With inputs from Syed Muthahar Saqaf in Salem, P.V.

However, in HOPCOMS, small-sized average variety is being sold at Rs. 53 a kg.The quantum of arrivals to the wholesale market has further dropped because of fall in production. Tomato is largely grown in fields having borewells. Many have completed planting recently and harvest is expected only next month or early September. Until then, prices may not fall drastically, but there is a likelihood of little drop in prices till early next month, sources in the APMC market said. Tomato yield is less this year compared to last year. Lack of rain and drop in groundwater table are among the reasons.

He said with the Income Tax Department warning against cash transactions of over Rs. 2 lakh, saying that the receiver of the amount would have to cough up an equal amount as penalty, wholesalers had been buying less from farmers.GST impactThis is the way business has been happening for years. Transporters charge us certain fee and then show smaller amounts on bills. Similarly, wholesalers make up this amount in some other area. Thats how we make profits.

Its no wonder then that its most popular wine is a ruby red from Rioja (pronounced ree-oh-hah), usually made with Tempranillo grapes.While in India, we have been familiar with the Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah (Shiraz) varieties for a while thanks to our homegrown wine industry, but Tempranillo is still a fairly new grape to us. Federico Lleonart, global wine ambassador for Pernod Ricard Winemakers was in India recently for the launch of Campo Viejo, one of the premire Rioja brands in the world, which recently dbuted in India. We spoke to him to help demystify the Tempranillo.The regionRioja is by far the most traditional, prestigious, and famous wine region in Spain. It has a DOCA appellation (qualified designation of origin), the highest regulation of quality and geographical origin for Spains products. Its largely a red wine region; but a small amount of white wine is made here too, mostly from the Viura grape, the white counterpart to the Tempranillo. As with many regions in Europe, wine production in Rioja started in the Roman times, so the region has more than 2,000 years of winemaking history, says Lleonart. Rioja rose to fame in the mid-19th century when the French producers arrived to seek an alternate wine-growing region after a severe blight destroyed the Bordeaux vineyards. Located in northern Spain, Rioja is a diverse region with three very different sub-regions. Theres the Rioja Alta, which is at a higher elevation and is known for its old-world style of wine. The Rioja Alavesa in the northwest and the smallest sub-region, which produces full-bodied wines with high acidity. Finally, the Rioja Baja, is influenced by a Mediterranean climate, leading to deeply coloured wines with a high alcohol content.The grapeRiojas signature grape is the Tempranillo. Its a very versatile grape that can produce a young, fruity wine as well as a Grand Reserva wine that has been aged for five years, says Lleonart. The range of flavours that you can get out of Tempranillo is very hard to get from other varieties. Tempranillo grapes smell like red fruits such as cherries, plums, and raspberries. Because of its versatility, it pairs well with different types of foods from meat and poultry to seafood and cheese.The brandCampo Viejo started in 1959 when three winegrowers from the region got together with the idea of producing high-quality Rioja wine. We are not the oldest or the largest winery in the region, but we are certainly the number one Rioja brand in the world. Campo Viejo exports to more than 60 countries, says Lleonart.The current winery was built in 2001 and is located just outside Logroo, the capital of Rioja. Our winery was certified as carbon-neutral five years ago. We use sustainable practices and also teach them to the winegrowers who work with us; sustainability is the only way to move forward, declares Lleonart.The winesWhile Campo Viejo has a large portfolio, it makes its debut in India with two wine variants, one red and one white, and both of them fall in the category of vin joven or young wine that isnt aged much, if at all. Campo Viejo Tempranillo is a red wine made with 100% Tempranillo grapes. Its a very fruit-forward wine, very smooth and easy to drink. Theres a smell of red fruits, a touch of liquorice, and because the wine is aged for four months in American oak barrels, theres also a hint of vanilla and coconut, explains Lleonart.It tastes fruity and fresh with low tannin. The drinkability of this wine is the key to its success in India; its a wine that will appeal to most consumers, elaborates Lleonart. The second wine is Campo Viejo Blanco, a white wine made with a blend of Tempranillo blanco and Viura grapes, that is not aged. This wine is super-new; we launched it only last year in the UK and later in Sweden, and now its in India. It is mainly made with Viura grapes but also has Tempranillo blanco, a white mutation of Tempranillo that appeared back in the 80s, says Lleonart.For a young market, and given the Indian penchant for wines that are sweeter and lighter, debuting with two fresh, fruit-forward wines seems like the right strategy for Campo Viejo. India has a great market potential and Campo Viejo is growing well around the world, so it made sense to expand into India, concludes Lleonart.Campo Viejo wines are priced at Rs. 2,000 in Mumbai."

Also, production has been less this year. In 2016, the prices hovered around Rs. 10 per kg in the wholesale market as tomatoes had been grown on a large scale, said Mr. Das.He, however, expressed hope that prices would crash in the next fortnight, when supply poured in from Bengaluru and Nashik.Vendors, meanwhile, are selling tomatoes at Rs. 80-90 per kg.The skyrocketing prices of the indispensable vegetable have also become the butt of jokes on social media.Pls dont misunderstand. I am not trying to show off...but we had...tomato soup along with tomato rice for lunch today [sic], read a Facebook post.Not just tomatoes, onion prices have also been showing an upward trend, with an average increase of Rs. 1 per kg over 10 days.Rajendra Prasad Sharma of Sharma and Company said the supply of onions had been disrupted due to heavy rain.Onion is supplied from Nashik, where heavy rain has disrupted supply. Prices have increased from Rs. 10 per kg to Rs. 20 per kg in less than 10 says, said Mr. Sharma.He, however, refused to speculate on far the prices might go up in the near future.Common phenomenonThe prices of seasonal vegetables, such as bottle gourd, bitter gourd and okra, have also doubled over the past fortnight.Hemant, a commission agent who deals in vegetables, however, argued that the rise in prices of vegetables was a common phenomenon during this part of the year.Crops are damaged due to heavy rain during monsoon, which in turn affects supply. The prices will continue to remain high for another two months, said Mr. Hemant.However, before the vegetables reach the kitchen, the prices go up by another 30-40%, making them unaffordable for the common man.Ram Pal, a squatter near Shani Mandir in Sector 37, argued that despite selling the vegetables at a rate 30-40% higher than the wholesale price, he ended up making only a marginal profit.I need to make up for the damaged and unsold vegetables and also recover the transportation cost. So, I end up making just Rs. 3-4 per kg after a hard days hard work, said Mr.Pal.Potato prices, however, continue to hover around Rs. 4-5 per kg on account of overproduction this year."

Mandi officials said that business of Rs 30-40 crore was hit as arrival of fruits and vegetables dropped significantly.The strike has been postponed after the government called the protesting traders for a meeting on Tuesday. ""An official from the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) called us at 2pm and asked us to meet the development minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday. If our demands are accepted, we will call off the strike, else, we will go back on strike later this week,"" said Metha Ram Kripalani, a trader.Sources said the supply of fruits was more affected than vegetables and over 90% of work at the mandi was held up. ""We had informed the farmers about the strike, so most of them did not come here. A slight shortage may continue on Tuesday but, if we decide to call off the strike, the situation should stabilise by Wednesday,"" said a trader.The reason for the unrest was a decision by the government to reallocate tomato sheds. A section of traders had complained to APMC about some unauthorised people who had occupied their sheds.""APMC later issued showcause notices to these traders but the response was not satisfactory. So, teams have gone there on a couple of occasions to remove them but traders have threatened self-immolation. On Monday a final notice was issued and appropriate action will be taken soon,"" said a senior official.Despite the eviction, government officials said, reallocation of sheds would still be done.

To bring about some order, we will have to carry our reallocation based on market fees paid by traders over the past three years. We have already asked for applications and the process has started,"" said an APMC official."

Around 400 tonnes of onions are imported from Maharashtra this season alone and another 10 loads every week by Anakapalli traders, sources said.With the farmers in Maharashtra staging protests demanding the government for loan waiver, traders started stocking up huge quantities of onions which led to shortfall in supplies.A trader at Anakapalli S Seetharam said: ""We don't have any proper facility to store onions in huge quantity.

Only Maharashtra and Karnataka produce Kharif season potatoes.Sahane said some diseases tend to affect vegetables during a dry spell.

He added that if the government rejected their demands, the city could face a shortage.The traders also reiterated old demands such as the agents be allowed to collect 6% commission charged from farmers, something that was scrapped following a High Court order three years ago.They also questioned why the Delhi government opted for online payments and did not allow cheque payments. The issue of deteriorating law and order situation in the area was also brought up.Personal reasonsThe section of traders opposed to Mr. Malhotra accused him of calling the strike as he wanted to be the one in-charge of allotting Parhs and wanted to control the entire tomato trade for his Tomato Traders Association (TTA).The Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) has a criteria that those who run businesses worth over Rs. 5 lakh or more be allotted a Parh.

The June number was the lowest since CSO started publishing the new retail inflation data in 2012. Separate data showed the annual rate of inflation, based on the monthly wholesale price index, stood at 1.9% in July compared to 0.9% for the previous month and 0.6% during corresponding month of the previous year.The increase in WPI inflation was largely led by vegetables, minerals and some food items. Vegetable prices rose an annual 22% while mineral prices shot up 25%. Robust monsoon rains are expected to have a sobering impact on prices but floods in some parts may put some temporary strains on supplies.""As expected, CPI inflation rebounded to 2.4% in July 2017 from the series low of 1.5% in June 2017, on account of rising vegetable prices, the revision in HRA (house rent allowance) and, to some extent, higher GST on various services,"" said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ratings agency ICRA.Some economists said the data showed that fears of an increase in prices post introduction of GST and implementation of Housing Allowances on headline inflation are rather limited at this point. According to Soumya Kanti Ghosh , group chief economic adviser at SBI, the July inflation number should ""thus be a transient one purely contributed by tomato prices.""Core CPI inflation recorded a marginal uptick to 4% in July 2017 from 3.9% in the previous month. Nayar said prices of various vegetables have displayed a month-on-month hardening so far in August and in addition, a reversal of the favourable base effect could result in retail food inflation rising further in the ongoing month. She said the staggered impact on the housing index, of CPI of the HRA of central government employees, is likely to push up housing inflation further over the coming year.""As the favourable base effect unwinds, vegetable prices record a seasonal hardening and the impact of HRA pushes up housing inflation further, we expect CPI inflation to ramp up over the next few months, and cross 4% by October 2017. Based on this anticipated trajectory, and the recent commentary by the Monetary Policy Committee , we see a low likelihood of further rate cuts in FY-18,"" Nayar said.In its latest monetary policy review earlier this month the RBI had cut the repo rate to 6% but kept the monetary policy stance at neutral, flagging possible return of inflationary pressures. While the government has been eyeing a sharp cut in interest rates, RBI has maintained its cautious stance."

The price of goat meat ('mutton', in local parlance) has gone down in the past month. And you can thank the friendly neighbourhood chicken seller for providing stiff competition, which has caused the price dip.While goat meat is selling at Rs 520 at Manicktala and Rs 530 at Rahmania in Kidderpore, it is as low as Rs 480 and even Rs 450 at markets in Gariahat and Behala. Till last month, the price was upwards of Rs 550.Meat traders blame chicken, which is selling for prices as low as Rs 120 across markets. Also, during monsoon, goats tend to develop fatal diseases (pneumonia, enterotoxemia and foot-and-mouth disease) and so, most sellers try to get the goats sold as quickly as possible.Food-loving Bengalis are overjoyed at the uncharacteristically 'downwardly mobile' prices.""At a time when all vegetables  from tomatoes to onions  are getting pricey, chicken and mutton prices have suddenly gone down. We are eating mutton at least twice or thrice a week these days. Earlier, mutton was only a Sunday treat,"" said Gariahat resident Arup Chakraborty Meat sellers at Gariahat said the price of goat meat was Rs 530 till end-June. Since then, there was a gradual decrease in the price, and now it's selling for Rs 480. ""The price has gone down since we are getting goats cheaper. Goat sellers are selling off the animals quickly fearing the animals would contract fatal diseases,"" said Md Asif, a seller at Gariahat.At Rahmania in Kidderpore, the price was hovering near the Rs 570 mark, but it has now come down to around Rs 530.However, 'reyaji mutton (goat meat with just the right amount of fat)', a delicacy and a speciality at their shop, is still priced at Rs 550. ""There has been a slight drop in price across the city. Apart from the cattle disease, another reason is stiff competition from chicken,"" said an employee at the shop.To make the most of the occasion, families of would-be brides and grooms in the upcoming wedding season are in a hurry to change their chicken platters with mutton items. ""We have been receiving requests to alter our price or change chicken items with mutton, but we have told our customers that the current price cannot affect our rate chart in any manner, as when we actually buy the meat, the prices are definitely going to rise again. We have a fixed rate chart and are charging our clients accordingly, irrespective of the changing prices,"" said Dwaraka Dutt of Diamond Caterers.Restaurants across the city, too, are following the same norm but some roadside eateries have slashed the prices of mutton rolls and mutton keema by around Rs 2 to Rs 5 to lure more customers. Industry sources said the prices are sure to increase a week before Viswakarma Puja on September 17 and again before the start of the wedding season.During monsoon, goats are prone to acquiring a number of parasite and bacteria-borne diseases that remain dormant during dry season. With arrival of wet weather, the parasites get the upper hand and their populations explode. The common diseases being pneumonia, foot and mouth disease  fatal contagious disease on the hoofs and mouth  and enterotoxemia  a disease that occurs due to toxin produced by bacteria of clostridium species."

This has led to a shortage of the vegetable.""Patel said it was difficult to make any prediction about the next season, but prices will most likely continue to rise. ""In Shravan, people refrain from using garlic and onion in Gujarat, but once Shravan is over, there will be a spike in demand accompanied by increase in prices,"" Patel said, adding, ""We expect onion prices to stabilize by last week of October or the first week of November, when the new crop arrives.""An office-bearer of APMC, Ahmedabad said that it was not just onion prices, but all vegetable prices have increased. Brinjals, according to quality, cost between Rs40 and Rs100 per kg in wholesale. At this time last year, tomatoes cost about one-fifth of what they cost now. Officials said vegetables in the retail market usually cost double or more than those in the wholesale market.APMC officials said that a good sign was that in the last couple of days prices had stabilized to a certain extent. Tomato, which had crossed the Rs80 mark was now down to Rs50 in the wholesale market, and has plateaued out, hopefully."

The YSRC will continue to confront you and question you over the promises you renege on. We will keep asking what punishment should be given for cheating the people. Since you are used to deceiving people for political gains, we will keep saying that there is nothing wrong if you are hanged, the YSRC chief lashed out at Naidu.Meanwhile, Jagans second outburst evoked a rash of protests from the Telugu Desam Party.

We have already lodged a complaint with the Returning Officer, she said.Agriculture Minister Somireddy Chandramohan Reddy said it was time the EC took a very serious note of the Opposition leaders remarks that had crossed all limits of decency.

Retail inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index was revised downwards to 1.46 per cent for June.It is also a reflection of monthly kitchen costs, which continued to remain soft, with prices showing gradual improvement at (-) 0.29% from (-) 2.12 per cent in June against 8.35 per cent in the same period last year.The fall in food inflation has been brought about by disinflation in the prices of mainly pulses and vegetables, which is assessed to be a stabilising factor.Vegetable prices fell by (-)3.57 per cent in July compared with (-)16.53 per cent in June, prices of pulses fell (-)24.75 per cent, against (-)21.92 per cent in June. Prices of foods and beverages became costly by 0.43 per cent against (-)1.17 per cent growth. While fuel inflation was 4.84 per cent in June, against 5.46 per cent in May and data shows that housing inflation remained nearly flat, growing 4.98 per cent in July from 4.7 per cent in June.Higher food articles and vegetable prices have pushed up wholesale inflation for July by 1.88 per cent, compared to 0.9 per cent in June. Wholesale inflation was low in July last year at 0.63 per cent.Food prices of pulses, potatoes and onions experienced a free fall as a result of a supply glut. Vegetable prices were up 22 per cent in July as a result of a hike in tomato prices.The heavy rains and delay in crop arrival to the mandi/markets made it costly for the consumers as the prices grew by 25.47 per cent in June. However, the broad conditions for agri-prices remain conducive given normal monsoon in most parts of the country and stable global commodity prices. This outlook is also corroborated in the second part of the Economic Survey released last week, said Pankaj Patel, president, FICCI.The wholesale price index data shows the doubling in the rate of inflation in July was mainly on account of a turnaround in prices of food article, especially vegetables."

With the Centre turning back to the statehood demand, the Mamata Banerjee administration has also continued with total isolation of the hills by cutting off Internet.IN PICTURES: Gorkhaland protests in DarjeelingLPG cylinder prices have touched high of Rs1,800 per cylinder and availability of food in markets have touched new low. Food supplies from the plains have been stopped by Bengali organisations of Siliguri, allegedly supported by the police.Though GJM has often distributed eatables to residents of tea gardens where cultivation does not take place, it has never been sufficient.However, one word has kept the indefinite strike going is indigenous knowledge.The indigenous knowledge orally passed down through generations has allowed the consumerism-struck residents of the two hill districts to fall back to their roots.This indigenous knowledge has enabled the residents to scourge the correct locations in the forests for shoots and roots and cultivate indigenous varieties of crop after supplies from the plains stopped. The indefinite strike has also led to increased cooperation between people -- including age-old barter system -- which had faded away as consumerism crept in.""Many of us had started to depend on rice from the plains and stopped cultivating our locally-grown indigenous varieties. Now, many farmers in our village and neighbouring villages are cultivating maize and local varieties of rice and are also fetching bamboo shoots and wild mushrooms from the forests. Many are also preparing fermented soyabean, a must with every meal that was earlier available in the markets, at their homes,"" said Man Bahadur of Yokprintam village, 25 km from Kalimpong town.The soil of this part of the Himalayas also supports cultivation of a variety of vegetables including potatoes, ladies finger, brinjals, tomatoes, beans, bitter gourd among others.With currency notes rendered useless in the wake of the complete shutdown, availability of farm workers has also gone down the abyss, which has also forced people to work together at each other's farmlands.""It seems we have returned to the traditional way of cultivation that our forefathers followed when society was egalitarian. Farm workers are not available due to the strike. So, people nowadays work together in rotation at one person's farm in the village. The next day, they will all work at someone else's land. After work, all the farm workers eat at the residence of the person on whose land they worked. Nobody is small or big in this work. This has brought us closer,"" said Ramesh Rai of Samalbong village in Kalimpong district.Besides this commune-type work, villagers are also sharing their meat. ""Just today, a big chicken was slaughtered at my house. While we kept 1 kilogram, we gave the rest to our neighbours. They would do the same when they slaughter their chickens,"" said Suren Tamang of Seokbhir Khani village of Kalimpong district.However, one crop that has taken a beating due to the strike is ginger. ""While 40 kg of ginger costed Rs 6,000 last year, it has reduced to only Rs 800 per 40 kg due to the strike,"" said Mangal Tamang of Takling village, equidistant from both Darjeeling and Kalimpong towns."

The hike in onion prices is burning a gaping hole in the pockets of middle class, which is forcing many to cut down consumption of onion. Prices in the wholesale and retail markets have more than doubled in just one week and are expected to increase more in the coming days.Onion prices in the city are ruling anywhere between `40 and `50 per kilo on Friday, as against `10 to `15 per kilo last week. Rythu Bazaars are selling them for `28 per kilo.Last time it was tomatoes and now it is onions, both are essential ingredients. With the rise in the prices we are forced to increase our monthly vegetable budget, Y Sujatha Reddy, a homemaker from Mehdipatnam, said. As per the data maintained by onion wholesale market in Malakpet, the city has a supply of nearly 12,000 bags ie 6,000 quintals per day. And the sudden increase in the prices can be attributed to low production and supply from Maharashtra and other neighbouring states.Almost 90 per cent supply comes from Maharashtra and 10 per cent from erstwhile Mahbubnagar district and some parts of Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh, said J Ananthaiah, selection grade officer at Malakpet wholesale market.And if wholesalers are to be believed, big traders in Maharashtra are deliberately holding up the stock for weeks in cold storage, which is resulting in the huge hike. To get more profit, traders are holding the stock and creating an artificial scarcity.Actually, compared to past years, production of onion is very high in Maharashtra this year, said a wholesale dealer in Malakpet. Meanwhile, prices of tomatoes have come down drastically compared to last few months. On Friday, tomatoes were being sold at between `43 and `50 per kilo as against `90 per kilo in July."

That's why our shawarma is distinctly Damascene,"" Abulezz said proudly.""We even add a Damascene marinade to the roasted chicken -- a secret recipe that no one knows here.""The blend hails from his family's restaurant in Daraya, one of the first towns to revolt against Syria's government when protests broke out in 2011.At the time, Abulezz left university to join rebels defending Daraya, which soon came under crippling government siege.But in August 2016, he was among thousands of fighters and civilians bussed out of the town to opposition-held Idlib after a settlement with the regime.'Good old days of Daraya'Tens of thousands of people have been displaced to Idlib province under similar ""reconciliation"" deals ending government siege and bombardment in exchange for rebels and other residents leaving.About two months ago, Abulezz opened up Sultan Daraya in Idlib city.He now boasts seven employees: five from Daraya, another from third city Homs which the government also recaptured after rebel evacuations, and Abu Ali, from Eastern Ghouta near Damascus.As he shaved chicken slices from the spit, 25-year-old Abu Ali crooned a nostalgic ode to Damascus.""Most of my customers are people from Madaya, Zabadani, Daraya, and Moadamiyet al-Sham,"" Abulezz said, listing towns around Damascus under ""reconciliation"" deals.""Everyone from the capital's suburbs has chased these Damascene specialties,"" he said.Indeed, Daraya natives were flocking to Abulezz's restaurant on the day of AFP's visit.Abu Hamdan, a furniture seller living in Atmeh near the border with Turkey, said he eats at Sultan Daraya ""just to remember the smell of Damascus.""""Coming to these restaurants reminds us of Daraya, of its people and their food. Being displaced is like sucking the soul out of the body,"" the 50-year-old said.Carpenter Abu Imad, 50, is also a regular visitor.""I come to Idlib city every time I need to buy some merchandise, so we drop by friends from our hometown,"" Abu Imad said.""I don't have a favourite dish. I come here to remember, to go back to the good old days of Daraya.""Daraya-style falafelAlong the same street lies Ibad al-Rahman's Damascene Delicacies, which dishes out hummus, fava beans drizzled in olive oil, and deep-fried falafel.The owner, 22-year-old Mohammad Nuh, also imported his succulent recipes from his family's restaurant in Daraya.""When I was 10, my father had a restaurant in Daraya. My brothers and I used to work there, which is where I learned the trade,"" he told AFP.""I prepare the food here the exact same way.""Inside, his three employees are cubing fresh tomatoes, chopping parsley bouquets, and dipping mashed chickpea mixtures into sizzling olive oil to make falafel.""I had to go into debt to open up this restaurant. It took a lot of hard work, but finally I have my own place,"" Nuh said.""It was a coincidence that we all ended up on this street. Most of us didn't know each other before, but we opened several different businesses,"" he said.Just like Sultan Daraya, Nuh's restaurant attracts customers whose palates are used to Damascene flavours.""Idlibis love hot sauce so much -- they put it on everything. This ruins the food,"" Nuh said.""We're introducing them to new recipes so they can actually taste the dish and its ingredients.""One regular is Abu Mukhtar, who hails from Madaya, another town near Damascus that has been evacuated.""We Damascenes are known for our love of good food, which we always found in local restaurants in Daraya, Madaya, or other areas in the suburbs,"" said Abu Mukhtar.The lanky, silver-haired Syrian teamed up with other Madayans to establish a supermarket named after their beloved hometown.""We decided with neighbouring businesses also owned by displaced people that we'll shop at each others' places for mutual benefit."""

TGI Fridays is now hosting VEg Fiesta, that features exotic American and Tex-Mex delicacies.Thankfully this casual dining restaurants idea of vegetarian food festival did not mean binging on paneer. FYI to pubs in Bengaluru, replacing chicken with paneer doesnt exactly cut it.The menu includes Mexican Vegetable Platter  an assortment of cauliflower wings, balsamic grilled mushroom veggie skewers, vegetali tostados, served with garlic bread and New Orleans Corn Cob and choice of side from Pasta Puttanesca and Caesar Salad.Portobello, Bean and Quinoa Burger is well seasoned, with flavours of spiced bean and quinoa patty and the really soft bun making it a delicious bite. I am definitely going back for the buttery rich Multigrain Brioche Bun and the pan seared Portobello mushroom. What a burger!The crunchy Franks Red Cauliflower Wings is my idea of the vegetable fried with spicy batter. However, this one a bit too sour to my liking and was served with a sauce, which too was sour. I would pass on this one.The Sizzling Portobello and Aubergine Fajita was one juicy succulent bite to dig into. Okay, now lets talk about this delicious bite, shall we? It has the grilled marinated Portobello mushroom with grilled spicy eggplant served on a skillet of roasted onions, red and green capsicum.The fajita has a dose of the good carbs with flaky tomato flavoured rice. Yes, I would go back for the fajitas. Any day. Pico de gallo and guacamole were offered as toppings.The Funghi Trifolati Truffled Pizza too has marinated Portobello mushroom slices cooked in Truffle oil. The pizza is a thin crust one, topped with olives, cherry tomatoes and a dollop of mozzarella. It is pretty decent on the taste part. I was too busy fishing mushroom slices off the pizza.Am I a mushroom fanatic? Well, may be.Milkshake paradiseThe restaurant is also has a new Franken Shakes menu where shakes go wild on Fridays. We tried the Whole Lotta Cho-co-lat and boy, was it beyond our imagination delicious. The decadent chocolate milkshake topped with whipped cream is topped with brownie, chocolate doughnut and chocolate sauce. Yup, this drink should in fact be illegal. And I am not even done describing it yet. The glass in which the shake is served is covered with frozen fosting with chocolate chips and Hersheys Kisses embedded on it. It was sinfully delicious and yes, I asked my colleague if she could help me down the stairs after this shake.Cost for two: `1,000 (approx.)"

The ambience is set in green and white palette with box lights hanging from the ceiling. You are most likely to be surrounded by techies and a family crowd at this restaurant that also has a pool table and couch set in the lobby.The Lamb Seek Kabab is minced well and is topped with fresh coriander, the Prawns Tempura falls on the crunchier side and the Chicken Tikka was well marianted with flavours of the charred grill in the soft meat pieces. In the vegetarian part of the starters menu, the croquette were equal parts crunchy on the outside and goeey delicious on the inside.Among cocktails, the whiskey infused in tea, served chill was an interesting combination, but did fall back on the blend and the alcohol punch. The Hot Toddy is warm and soothing, but missed a brandy punch.And now that you have read through the starters, lets take a minute to talk about the bhindi, shall we? The Bendakaya Pulusu is hands down the best bhindi with tamarind curry combination I have had so far. The tamarind based gravy has the typical Indian curry texture with the sourness of the tamarind and tomatoes. And the ladies finger pieces soaks in the spicy tamarind curry flavours and makes for a delicious bite with naan. Save butter garlic naan for the non vegetarian curry, Id say.The Murgh Musallam, a Mughlai style chicken curry in the restaurant is rich and creamy. The onion based gravy underplays the spice tadka in the dish and tastes buttery instead. No complaints though.The aromatic Mutton Rogan Josh has rich Kashmiri flavours with delicate lamb chunks. The Chicken Biriyani came in as a colourful ensemble of rice cooked well, but was served cold. The Dal Makhani on the other hand was another star on the dinner table.The red kidney beans and black gram cooked with plenty of butter and spices was really smooth, creamy on the palate and yes, I asked for a second serving of this delicious Punjabi dal that stuck true to its roots.The cheesecake served with a side of blueberries sauce has balanced flavours of cream and cheese and has a chocolate chunk topping that adds crunch to the dessert.Place: Nook - Aloft Bengaluru Cessna Business Park, BellandurCost for two: `2000"

Moshe was two years old when the attack happened.""Ahead of the visit, both countries have prepared a roadmap of joint economic undertakings,"" the Haaretz reported on June 29, 2017. ""The Israeli cabinet approved a 23-page document continuing scores of bilateral measures and a budget of 280 million shekels (about $79.6 million or Rs 514 crore)  a bigger sum than Israel has ever set aside for China, Africa and Latin America combined. No fewer than 11 ministries were involved in preparing the programme.""Here are five things that define the India-Israel relationship today:India is Israel's top destination for arms exports, buying 41 per cent of export between 2012 and 2016, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, an independent global conflict and arms-research institute.Israel is India's third-largest source of arms, with a 7.2 per cent share of imports between 2012 and 2016, next to the US (14 per cent) and Russia (68 per cent).The earliest signs of collaboration came during the 1962 Sino-Indian war, when Israel provided India military aid. Israel also assisted India during two wars with Pakistan in 1965 and 1971.India reciprocated during the six-day war in 1967 by providing Israel with spare parts for French-made Mystere and Ouragan aircraft as well as AX-13 tanks (also French-made).The highlight of the partnership was Israel's supply of artillery shells during the Kargil war in 1999 when India faced a shortage.In the late 1990s, a crucial defence deal was the Indian purchase of Barak 1, an air-defence missile, bought specifically for its capability to intercept US-made Harpoon missiles deployed by Pakistan.India's imports of unarmed aerial vehicles (UAVs) have almost all been from Israel. Of 176 UAVs purchased from Israel, 108 are Searcher UAVs and 68 are Heron UAVs.In April 2017, India and Israel signed a $2 billion deal for an advanced medium-range surface-to-air missile system, which will provide the Indian army the capability to shoot down aircraft, missiles and drones at ranges of up to 70 km.In September 2016, tests were conducted of the jointly developed Long Range Surface-to-Air Missile with a range of 70 km, intended to equip three guided-missile destroyers of the Indian Navy.India successfully tested the Israeli-made SPYDER quick-reaction surface-to-air missile in May this year. The Indian Air Force (IAF) is planning to deploy this system on its western border.India and Israel also closely cooperate on counter-terrorism issues through a joint working group on counter-terrorism.Several ministerial and high-level official visits to Israel preceded Modi's tour. These included visits by then Home Minister LK Advani in 2000, former President APJ Abdul Kalam in 2008, Home Minister Rajnath Singh in 2014, President Pranab Mukherjee in 2015 and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj in 2016.Three Indian naval ships, destroyer INS Mumbai, frigate INS Trishul and tanker INS Aditya, made a goodwill visit at the Haifa port in May 2017 to mark 25 years of full diplomatic relations between the two countries.An Indo-Israel agriculture action plan for 2015-18 is operational, and 15 of the proposed 26 centres of excellence in agriculture are being developed in India with Israel's help to showcase the latest technology to Indian farmers.Phase-I (2010-12) and phase-II (2012-15) of the agreement are complete, according to a reply to the Lok Sabha.India has benefited from Israeli technologies in horticulture mechanisation, protected cultivation, orchard and canopy management, nursery management, micro-irrigation and post-harvest management, particularly in Haryana and Maharashtra.Every year, more than 20,000 farmers visit the Agricultural Centre of Excellence at Gharaunda in Karnal, Haryana, where a nursery produces hybrid seedlings  including tomatoes, cherry-tomato, colored capsicum, cucumbers, eggplant and chilli pepper-grown in small, individual cells, ready to be transplanted into containers or a field.There was a five-to 10-fold increase in crop yields with an accompanying 65 per cent reduction in use of water and noticeable decrease in the use of pesticides and fertilisers, according to a December 2014 report on the Indo-Israel Agriculture Project.On June 28, 2017, the Union cabinet approved a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Israel on the National Campaign for Water Conservation in India.Technologically-adept Israel has developed water-management technologies, located as it is in a semi-arid region with limited sources of fresh drinking water.India and Israel had earlier signed an MoU on water resources management and development cooperation in November 2016.Israel was India's 38th-largest trading partner, with trade of $5.02 billion (Rs 33,634 crore) in 2016-17, down 18 per cent over 2012-13. The trade balance stood in India's favour at $1.10 billion (Rs 7,370 crore) in 2016-17.Mineral fuels and oils are India's leading export to Israel, worth $1.01 billion in 2016-17.India's major imports from Israel in 2016-17 included natural or cultured pearls and precious stones, worth $1.11 billion.Trade in diamonds accounts for nearly 54 per cent of the bilateral trade. Nearly 40 diamond dealers from India have opened offices at the Israeli diamond exchange in Ramat-Gan. Some of these dealers have been active in Israel for nearly 30-40 years.The Israeli government has proposed measures such as ""offering export insurance, liberalising the aviation sector and granting longer-term visas"". The aim is to boost Israeli exports to India by 25 per cent over the next four years and tourists to 80,000 annually.""Relations with Israel are significant for India because of cooperation in agriculture, defence and science/technology,"" Uttara Sahasrabuddhe, professor of international relations at the University of Mumbai, told IndiaSpend.""Israel has been giving key weapons systems to India, including missiles; it has given us those weapons which we could not directly buy from the US for ideological reasons; cooperation in counter-terrorism from information sharing to techniques/doctrine of counter terrorism,"" Sahasrabudde said. ""It is also an important source of foreign investment, if tapped with care. The visit of the Indian PM will indicate that New Delhi has come out of the old mindset."""

There is a hybrid mango tree, a six-ft tall drumsticks tree, tomatoes saplings, bottle gourd, green chillies, peas, radish, beetroots, and more. ""My forefathers from Andhra Pradesh were into agriculture. After migrating to a metro like Chennai, where we rarely get to live in spacious homes. So, it is not possible to think of agriculture.

She starts her day at 5am and spends an hour dabbling in her favourite hobby , gardening. The family consumes everything they grow in their kitchen garden After being a part of an NGO, Archana Stalin realised the importance of conserving nature and finding a way to bring plants inside her home. So, she, along with her husband Stalin Kalidoss, launched `myHarvest' project that is helping city dwellers grow their own chemical-free green vegetables and fruits in their homes.In her 1,000-sq-ft terrace garden in KK Nagar, they have been growing vegetables like eggplants, spinach, bittergourd, beans, cabbages, okra, peppers, green chillies and other vegetables for the past three years now. "" After working with organic farmers and experts who understand how kitchen terrace garden works, we decided to venture into something that helps others eat fresh and healthy like we do. This is how `myHarvest' started. Once someone approaches us, we go and visit their place to understand what kind of vegetables they can grow in their space. Then the customer purchases a package that contains soil, seeds, fertilizers and other necessary equipment required for setting up a terrace or kitchen garden. Our job is to set up the garden in their house and guide them how to take care of it,"" explains Archana.They prepare the soil and fertilisers like panchagavya , source seeds from the local suppliers and organic vendors in Chennai. They are also working with schools, colleges and corporates to make them understand the concept of growing their own veggies.For 54-year old Christie Manohar, agriculture is not new. She has grown up watching her parents growing their own vegetables in their backyard, using organic manure. Recalling the childhood memories, Christie shares, ""My mother used to pluck vegetables and cook for all of us."" It was in the month of May this year when she came across an advertisement in a newspaper that said the state government was selling saplings, manure and sack bags at concession price. ""This is just a start, if it goes well, we will try organic farming in our five-acre land in Padappai town. All of us in the family are interested in gardening.We use neem oil, soapy water and plain water solutions to spray on the plants to keep them insect-free. To start your own kitchen garden, one need to invest a minimum of `600 to maximum `1,500,"" she shares.There's tender okra, tomatoes, green chillies, radish, eggplants and bitter-gourd in her 200-sq-ft terrace garden in Shanthi Colony, Anna Nagar.

From Rs. 110 a kg, the price came down to Rs. 55 and below a few days after hundreds of groups shared the message, said architect S. Gopakumar of Better Kochi Response Group. The campaign titled No Tomato Week began on July 22 and went on till July 30 in the initial phase. Mr. Gopakumar said the initiative was on the lines of a tradition followed in Japan, wherein they stop consuming commodities whose prices go up exponentially. This leads to a fall in their prices, he said.The WhatsApp group message urged all members to either stop or minimise consumption of tomato just for a week or 10 days. The aim was to demoralise hoarders. Members said the prices had slumped within 10 days of the start of the campaign. This group activity to check price rise can be implemented on a long-term basis, Mr. Gopakumar said.Meanwhile, residents associations here are also using social media to instantaneously circulate messages on relevant issues. A. Ajithkumar, general secretary of Ernakulam District Residents Association Apex Council, said at least seven WhatsApp groups were active at the zonal level.Residents have formed groups to share photographs and news on poor infrastructure in their respective localities.

Rain that wreaked havoc in Gujarat and Maharashtra has affected the supply to the city, traders said.Onions were priced at Rs. 40/kg in retail market on Wednesday and this may further go up, note traders.The Koyambedu wholesale market receives only half of the normal onion loads of 65 trucks daily. The city mainly receives its stock from Maharashtra and Gujarat apart from Karnataka.With the floods damaging crops in those States, less than half of the produce is reaching the city. Moreover, stocks from Karnataka are also being diverted to other places in north India like Delhi and Mumbai where the demand is high, traders said.Onions are priced up to Rs. 35 per kg in the wholesale market due to the increasing shortage, said P.Sukumar, joint secretary, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants Association. Cabbage, a vegetable that is usually cheap, has become dearer as truck loads are being diverted to north India.Price of tomatoes downThough cost of tomatoes is steadily dipping, it still remains out of reach for many consumers and is priced up to Rs. 68 per kg in retail stores. S. Chandran, a wholesale merchant, said the market has started getting fresh supply of tomatoes from Hosur belt and this has brought down the price. But, we may have to wait till December for the onions to cost less as produce from Andhra Pradesh may arrive only then. Cost of onions may even go up to Rs. 60 a kg in retail market, he said.The supply scenario at Koyambedu wholesale complex is significant as several small markets in Chennai and other places such as Tindivanam, Cuddalore and Vandavasi depend on this wholesale hub for their supply. The sudden surge in prices of vegetables and off-season for weddings have also contributed to dull sales in the market. It may one or two months for sales to pick up, traders said."

Rajendran, president of Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants Association.The wholesale price of tomato is Rs. 40 a kg, small onion Rs. 70 a kg and big onion Rs. 30 a kg. Beans, carrot, yam and okra are all Rs. 40 a kg. In the case of chilli, it is Rs. 50 a kg. The prices of tomato and small onion are expected to come down and that of big onion go up, he says.Poor rainfallThe main reason for the spiralling prices is poor rainfall, say vegetable traders.There is no shortage in availability of vegetables and the demand has not reduced much because of the prices. Even in places where the rain has been good now, it will take three months for arrivals to start from these areas.Most of the arrivals to Coimbatore now are from other States.Further, there are restrictions to avoid overloading of trucks and transport costs are up, adding to the prices of the vegetables, Mr. Rajendran says.Hoteliers, domestic consumers and bulk buyers are affected equally. Even a domestic consumer needs four or five varieties of vegetables a day. Tomatoes and onions are essential. If the prices continue to remain high, it will bring down the volume of purchase.Usually, prices are down during this period. Arrivals from different parts of the State are not there now and most of the vegetables come from other States. Though hotels buy directly from farmers, availability is down this year because of monsoon failure, says D. Srinivasan, president of Coimbatore District Hoteliers Association. The volume of vegetables used cannot be reduced and there are no substitutes to replace some vegetables. Hence, hotels are finding it difficult to manage. Business is down 30 % since the implementation of GST, he says.The demand for vegetables will go up next month as the festival season starts and this might lead to further increase in prices, adds Mr. Rajendran."
5a0f51649855b76bf13d7e3f,are vegetable prices soaring?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/are-vegetable-prices-soaring/article19527329.ece,2017-08-20,,The Hindu,"What happened in July?July saw a rise in inflation at the wholesale level to 1.88% from 0.9% in June, with the spiralling tomato prices, along with other food items, contributing significantly to this rise. Tomatoes saw a sharp inflation of over 209.5% in July against contraction of 29.4% in June, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. Brinjal registered a rise in inflation to 21.1% in July, from Junes contraction of 3.1%. The prices of tomato, onion and potato have increased in recent months owing to disparity between demand and supply on account of a drop in production because of unfavourable weather, a rise in transport costs, seasonality and supply chain constraints.Why is supply low?While the rise in the retail prices of tomato is being associated with low supply from key growing States, including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka following heavy rain in a few regions that damaged the crop and hindered transport as well, onion prices have seen a rise on account of low supply from the southern States.The fluctuation in vegetable prices, which is commonly referred to as seasonal, is associated with the economics of demand and supply. The Centre maintains that seasonal fluctuations in market arrivals have hit supplies. The other reasons for the fall in supply are adverse weather conditions and imperfections in marketing channels. However, the clash of interests between the consumer, the producer and the middlemen is a key factor that policy-makers must urgently address.Where is the problem?For years, the consumer, the producer (farmer) and the middleman have had a clash of interest when it comes to agricultural commodities. While the consumer wants to buy a commodity at the lowest price, the producer (farmer) desires to sell the produce at the maximum price. The middleman, on the other hand, wants to maximise profits. Striking a balance among these stakeholders could possibly address the issue of price fluctuation to some extent. Vegetable producers, especially small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. As vegetables find their way to the market, the cost of packaging, grading, transporting and fees, besides the margins of the middlemen, are some of the elements that determine the final price the consumer has to bear.Will better storage help?Agricultural commodities with a short shelf-life are prone to price fluctuation and hence require better infrastructure for marketing.Economists like Prof. M.S. Sidhu at Punjab Agricultural University believe that improved transport and upgraded storage infrastructure will keep a check on price volatility. Indias cold storage capacity at present is nearly 3.5 crore tonnes, which is short by 30-40 lakh tonnes, and it needs to be increased. Besides, cold storages need to be upgraded, equipping them to store fruit and vegetables at right temperatures so that they stay fresh.Also, the high cost of transport needs to be addressed. In the case of perishable vegetables, the government could consider promoting low-cost refrigerated trucks and weigh the option of freight subsidy.According to an estimate, there are 7,000-8,000 refrigerated trucks plying in India, mostly transporting pharmaceuticals and dairy products. Transport of perishable vegetables in refrigerated trucks could be one of the options that would help in better supply and availability of the produce.What about the supply chain?The mismanagement in the supply chain is another reason for the huge gap in prices that growers sell perishable agricultural commodities for and what the consumer pays. Creation of co-operative groups and societies are probably an alternative that could assist in minimising the marketing channel. They can work in tandem across the States and supply vegetables from surplus regions to places where the produce is in demand.Most farmers in India have small landholdings. Nearly 85% farmers are small, who have less than 2 hectares. Cultivation has become unviable for these small farmers, but through cooperative groups and societies even a small quantity of crop produced by the farmer can be marketed. This will stabilise prices and benefit consumers.VIKAS VASUDEVA"

To spread this message and to encourage people to go green, we are holding workshops for kids where they can learn how to make clay Ganeshas,"" said Sowmya Reddy, a civic leader from Bangalore Political Action Committee (B.PAC). It had earlier conducted green Ganesha workshops in seven wards and is set to hold them in five more wards.Meanwhile, a group of four friends has taken the concept of green Ganesha to the next level, by coming up with an idol which, on immersion, sprouts a plant. The Sasya Ganapathi kit, developed by Sudhakar M, Bharath Srinivas, Punith Kumar and Vivek N Kumar, includes an idol made of clay, potting mix and organic fertilizer and is painted with natural colours. There's also a terracotta-coloured plastic pot, a nutrient block which expands up to 10 litres of soil, and a packet of organic seeds (tomato, lady finger or holy basil).During the ceremony, the pot must be filled with water and the idol placed in it. The nutrient block should also be added to the pot. In a day's time, the soil block would have expanded and covered the pot. Once this happens, the seeds can be sown, ensur ing over time the Ganesha transforms into a plant.Each kit is being sold for Rs 1,501 and they are being shipped across the country.""When we started this year, we thought we'd only be able to sell 250-300 kits. However, we have sold 1,000 kits across India,"" said Sudhakar.Then there is Green My Life, an online garden store which too sells idols that, on immersion, grow into plants.""Along with the idol, we are giving the buyer a grow bag, coco peat and a packet of seeds. This way , the Ganesha can stay with you in your home,"" said Gitanjali Ramani, founder and CEO.The online platform is also selling do-it-yourself Ganeshas.For Rs 550, you can get the clay, a pot, natural paint and an instruction manual to create your own Ganesha. ""Last year, we got about 2,000 orders for green Ganeshas. As we hadn't expected so many orders, we couldn't meet the demand. We have increased supply this year,"" said Gitanjali.""Since last year, we have been using clay Ganeshas.We immerse the idols in a big drum within the apartment premises and the water is then used in the garden,"" said B S Raghavendra, a member of the Forthouse RWA, Kodigehalli.JP Nagar 6th Phase too seems to be going green. "" Aware of the harmful effects of PoP idols, people in our area have switched to clay and mud Ganeshas,"" said Dhananjaya Padmanabhachar, a resident.Meera Arun, who lives in Banashankari, has been organizing workshops for the past two years on the importance of switching to mud and clay idols and how to make them. ""We've stuck posters in the locality, telling people to say no to plasterpaintedglazed idols. We are urging them to get clay idols not more than 3ft tall, and immerse them in buckets in their garden itself. We'll also speak to street vendors, asking them not to leave festival waste on roads. They should pile them up neatly on the sides for BBMP workers to clear it the next day,"" she said.At a time when the government and civic bodies are facing flak for the city's degenerating waterbodies, it's the citizens and their collective efforts in the right direction that could make a lasting difference.Growing awareness about the ruinous effects of Plaster of Paris idols on lakes is driving Bengalureans to opt for greener versions of the elephant god.Even better is the concept of clay idols that could sprout plants later. While the authorities pass the buck to cover up their failures in saving Bengaluru's lakes, it's heartening to see a proactive citizenry cheerily lead by example."

Lot of plantain trees were destroyed due to drought in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, and as a result there is huge scarcity of bananas, especially Nendran variety, which is mainly sourced from Mettupalayam.""Though there are plantation cultivations in Wayanad, Thrissur and Ernakulam, it is not sufficient to cater the needs and demands of shopkeepers and customers,"" said A Siddique, secretary of banana market stall association.In addition to Onam, Chingam is a season of weddings.

This has been made possible by introducing sale of vegetables in cooperation department fairs, Supplyco fairs and Kudum bashree outlets, the director pointed out.Among the 1,500 stalls to be run directly by the department in association with Vegetables and Fruits Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) and Horticorp are 51 eco-shops selling its own brand of organic vegetables 'Kerala Organic', which had hit the market last Vishu . ""All other outlets too will be selling organic or GAP-certified vegetables at a price that is bit higher,"" Sunil Kumar said.Locally grown vegetables will be procured from farmers by Hor ticorp at a 10% higher price, while the farmers will get 20% high price for GAP-cer tified products. At the stalls, the con sumers can buy them availing 30% and 10% discounts respectively. ""Be sides vegetables, the stalls will be selling the fa mous Marayoor jaggery, coconut oil and honey,"" the agriculture director said.The department is hoping to procure 150 tonnes of best qual ity garlic with great medicinal value from Kanthalloor-Vatta vada belt. The area famed for vegetable cultivation will provide a significant volume of cabbage, potato and cauliflower, for which the state has been depending heavily on neighbouring states.Majority of the vegetables to be purchased by Horticorp from other states are the ones not grown in the state. Kerala grows only around 15 types of vegeta bles out of 50 in demand. ""The cultivation of tomato, which was widespread in Palakkad district, has come down, and we need to procure it from outside,"" Sunil Kumar said."

Improvements in performance at the mining and electricity sectors buoyed the index, with expansion in the mining sector at 4.8%, up from 0.4% in June.The electricity sector grew 6.5% in July, accelerating from 2.1% in the previous month.Manufacturing, however, grew only 0.1%. Still, this was an improvement from Junes 0.4% contraction.Not out of woodsAlthough the IIP has improved compared to the previous month, the level is still very low, so it cannot be taken as a symptom of a turnaround in the economy, said D.K. Srivastava, chief policy advisor at EY India. The electricity and mining sectors are largely driven by the governments own demand. Some improvement was expected because of the governments own expenditure.And if you combine this with the fact that CPI inflation has also started to rise, the economy is still not out of the woods, Mr. Srivastava added.With retail inflation now edging closer to the Reserve Bank of Indias upper bound for price gains, economists see reduced prospects for any immediate interest rate cut by the central bank.Notably, core and non-core inflation gauges have jumped in the month, driven by higher transport, housing and possibly transient impact from price changes due to the GST roll-out (eg. health), Radhika Rao, India Economist at DBS Bank, wrote in an emailed statement. With August headline inflation on the higher end of the central banks 2-3.5% target for the first half of the current fiscal year, any lingering expectations for an October rate cut were likely to be doused, she wrote.While the uptick in CPI inflation was in line with expectations, the broad-based rise in core CPI inflation was a cause for some concern, according to Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ratings agency ICRA.However, some food price gains were likely to moderate this month relieving some inflationary pressure, Ms. Nayar wrote in an emailed note.Prices of various vegetables such as tomatoes and, to a smaller extent, potatoes, have eased in month-on-month terms so far in September 2017, which would contain the uptick in food inflation in the current month, Ms. Nayar wrote. In addition, prices of onions, while still high, have retreated from the peak recorded in late-August.The fuel and light segment witnessed a marginal quickening: at 4.94% from 4.86% in July. The housing segment saw an acceleration in inflation to 5.58% from 4.98%.The staggered impact on the housing index of the CPI, of the revision in HRA (house rent allowance) of central government employees, is likely to continue to push up housing inflation further over the coming year, Ms. Nayar wrote.While the overall primary goods category of IIP grew 2.3% in July, rebounding from a contraction of 0.2% in June, the capital goods sector continued to contract, shrinking by 1% in July following Junes 6.8% contraction. Consumer durables, too, contracted in July, by 1.3%, compared with a contraction of 2.1% in June.Weak demandIndustrial output remained weak despite the possible positives from restocking showing demand impulses still remained subdued, wrote Richa Gupta, senior economist, Deloitte.The big ticket manufacturing sector has continued to underperform, she wrote. Investment demand remains weak as capital goods production continued to contract. While the festival season could see some demand revival, any meaningful recovery may take longer to take hold, Ms. Gupta added."

Tomatoes cost `35 and while onions, which are priced at `23 in rythu bazaar, are being sold at over `50 in retail markets. The most important item during the festival- coconut is priced at over `20.As most people prefer to buy fruits and flowers just before the festival, serpentine queues were seen at market places on Thursday.

5a11065b9855b76bf13dbb53,Farm livelihoods: beware of RCEP,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/629065/farm-livelihoods-beware-rcep.html,2017-08-20,,Deccan Herald,"By Devinder Sharma, Aug 20 2017, 23:08 ISTIt was always known, but when a United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) report in 2003 explained in detail how devastating cheaper imports of agricultural commodities and products have been to domestic production, and presented a chart detailing out how a surge in imports acted as a strong blow to the local economy, I thought the world would sit back and take notice.On the contrary, international trade negotiations have now taken a more aggressive stance. More and more opening up of the trade barriers has destroyed millions of livelihoods in the bargain.Lets examine what is at stake. Over the past few decades, especially after 1995 when the World Trade Organisation (WTO) came into existence, the effort has been to force developing countries to remove trade barriers and import duties.According to FAO, when imports of tomato paste increased by 15 times in Senegal, local production declined by 50%; when vegetable oil imports doubled in Jamaica, it recorded a 68% cut in domestic production.In India, too, when imports of vegetable oils surged between 1993-94 and 2015-16 following a systematic reduction in import duties over the years, India turned from a position of self-sufficiency to become the worlds second biggest importer of edible oils.What was attempted initially through the WTO was aggressively pushed under bilateral Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and regional trade pacts. While numerous studies have shown that India has hardly gained from the opening up of the domestic market, the damage done to agriculture has been enormous.As if this is not enough, a Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) treaty, which concluded its latest round of negotiations in Hyderabad in July, is considering removing import duties on 92% of all traded commodities. Worse, it is believed that a draconian provision whereby the import duties that will be reduced to zero under the treaty cannot be raised later, is being considered, a provision that even the WTO did not impose.In other words, the RCEP treaty, if India agrees to sign, would open up the Indian market for zero import duty for all times to come. It will take away the right from India to protect and ensure the livelihood security of its 600 million farmers. The treaty is being negotiated between 16 countries, including South Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and China.Surprisingly, every time India enters into a trade negotiation, it seeks greater market access for its services, including easier norms for its professionals to move across borders for short-term work.While this is certainly important, one fails to understand why agriculture is being deliberately sacrificed in the bargain. After all, domestic agriculture, which entails the livelihoods of 600 million farmers, cannot be placed on the chopping block of international trade.Grim prospectsTake the case of the dairy sector. According to Jayan Mehta, senior general manager of Amul dairy cooperatives, the livelihoods of 150 million people engaged in dairy farming will be severely if RCEP negotiations continue on current lines.India is the biggest producer of milk in the world. Presently, the import of milk and milk products are allowed with an import duty ranging from 40% to 60%. This provides enough protection for the local dairy industry to build its competitiveness.Opening up the flood gates will inundate India with cheaper milk flowing in from Australia and New Zealand. Let us not forget that while Australia, with only 6,300 dairy farmers and New Zealand, with 12,000, are pushing aggressively to protect the economic interests of their small dairy farming communities, India is willing to sacrifice the livelihoods of 150 million dairy farmers.Since India has a huge domestic demand for milk, it doesnt have the kind of export surplus that Australia and New Zealand have. Just because those countries are willing to provide greater access to Indian IT professionals, should India jeopardize the livelihoods of 150 million dairy farmers?Dairy is not the only commodity for which the market is to open up. India will have to open up for all kinds of fruits, vegetables, pulses, potatoes, spices, plantation crops, seeds, silk, processed foods, etc.Although India is still insisting on allowing zero tariff import on only 80% of the traded goods, and is seeking a three-tier structure, the negotiations are led by the dominant and aggressive stance of countries like China, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea, which will eventually have their say.It has taken so many years for the world to understand that the WTO was designed to serve the commercial interests of only the top 1%. The RCEP treaty, being negotiated without drawing any lessons from the WTO experience, would strike a much severe blow. What was negotiated in the Hyderabad round of talks has not been made public.

It also cut its GVA growth forecast to 6.9 per cent from the earlier 7.2 per cent.Stating that the RBI may go for a rate cut at the December review of the policy, BofAML said, ""Although inflation is turning up to 3.1 per cent in August on rising tomato and onion prices and 4.6-4.9 per cent in 1H18, it is still well within the RBI's 2-6 per cent inflation target.""HSBC said there are ""downward risks"" to its growth forecast of 7.1 per cent, while Japanese brokerage Nomura cut its calendar 2017 forecast by 0.20 per cent to 6.7 per cent.""The key question is how soon the economy will recover from the GST-led disruptions,"" Nomura said. The brokerage, however, said that the RBI will hold rates.Analysts at Morgan Stanley said they continue to see a recovery, but the data release poses downward risks to its growth forecasts.""The key risks to the outlook are the impact of weaker monsoon on agricultural output; the pace of NPL resolution, which would affect credit growth; and private capex and global trade conditions,"" it said.India's GDP grew slower at 5.7 per cent during April-June -- the lowest in three years of the Modi government while lagging China for the second straight quarter -- as manufacturing slowed ahead of the GST launch and note ban impact lingered.Gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the first quarter of 2017-18 was lower than 6.1 per cent of the preceding one and 7.9 per cent in the same period last fiscal.China recorded 6.9 per cent growth in January-March as well as April-June quarters.Expressing concern on the GDP numbers, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said manufacturing growth rate seems to have bottomed out as GST has been implemented and destocking of pre-GST stocks is almost complete."

Some of this amount will have to be raised by the charity.Cini aims to cover 1,01,000 tribal households in four states -- Jharkhand, Odisha, Maharashtra and Gujarat -- and make them lakhpatis by 2020 by trebling their income from farming and animal husbandry to Rs 1.2 lakh per annum.In these four states, Cini covers seven blocks in five districts of Jharkhand (East Singhbhum, Hazaribag, Deoghar, Dhumka and Khunti); two blocks in one district of Odisha (Keonjhar); eight blocks in three districts of Gujarat (Mahisagar, Sabarkhantha and Dahod); and two blocks in two districts of Maharashtra (Nadurbar and Dhule).These four states are home to over 65 per cent of the nation's tribal population, Neelam said when asked why only these four states have been covered under its project.""Nearly half-way into the project, we've already created 15,000 lakhpati kisans across these four states,"" he said, adding the number of households that got lifted out of poverty through the high-value agriculture and piggery under the initiative stands at 41,313 now.Neelam said the livelihood enhancement initiative is aimed at trebling their income to Rs 1.2 lakh a year and is based on a four-pronged strategy - high value farming; livestock (primarily piggery and goats); non-timber forest produce like lac and horticulture.The initiative seeks to invest Rs 65,000 into each household of which the Tata Trusts will invest Rs 20,000 each and the rest will come through other agencies, including government grants but arranged through/by the Trusts.He sounded very confident of meeting the overall target of creating over 1.1 lakh lakhpati farmers (by 2020) as the traction in terms of adoption of their methods has been gaining better momentum.""Having already sown the seeds of change among a large number of farmers, who have become the brand ambassadors of the project, our work has become much easier now.""Total households engaged in agriculture stands at 45,740, who do at least two seasons now, while the total additional area brought under irrigation is about 4,973 acres, he said, adding total market-linked vegetable production clusters created stands at 53.While on a recent visit to the tribal-dominated Jharkhand, where Cini seeks to cover over 30,000 households, Cini state manager P Sirshendu said the success of the scheme has so far been beyond their expectation.He said in FY17 alone, more than 27,310 tribal households, spanning 429 villages and consisting of over 2020 self-help groups (SHGs), have benefited from the project.This agency has visited five villages in the Khunti district and met with dozens of farmers who do soilless farming of tomatoes and some other green vegetables.In a village in Khunti, there already are seven lakhpati farmers - all women-- who earn more Rs 1 lakh from farming and piggery. They said before they joined Cini initiatives, their lives were miserable and fully depended on the mercy of rain gods and middlemen.In another village, which is Christian-dominated and whose residents are into cultivation of lac - a natural adhesive used in industries - farmers said their lives have changed very radically after joining the Cini project.At another village, a farmer-turned-entrepreneur runs a hi-tech polyhouse nursery to grow soilless veg saplings.The farmer said he has invested Rs 7 lakh in setting up the nursery of which Rs 1 lakh was his contribution and the rest funded by the project with a condition that first he has to meet the demand from nearby villages only. He said within two years, he has recovered his investment.Cini also involves irrigation (drip and mulching), setting up solar pumps for irrigation, education and sports, especially hockey which includes a world-class hockey training academy at Jamshedpur.The academy has set a target of selecting at least 4-5 kids from the region to play in the Hockey Junior World Cup to be held in 2020.Its education initiative has resulted in dropout rate at Cini schools falling to 2-5 per cent against the state average of 12 per cent, while attendance has shot up to over 80 per cent."

Today she has more than 200 varieties of different plants. I started off with flowers such as the hibiscus and acanthaceae for my pooja room and then one day as I was washing spinach, which I got from the shop, I found a lot of mud and dirt in it. That is when I thought of growing spinach myself, and that became the first vegetable in my garden, she says.Sujatha then went on to grow other vegetables such as green chilli, ladies finger and brinjal. It was only after she came across a group called the Organic Garden Foundation, through a friend of hers, that she started taking terrace gardening seriously. My friend added me to this group and I would see how the members would post pictures of their jasmine, cabbage, carrots and so on. I was really fascinated and this motivated me to expand my garden, she says with a smile.Sujathas terrace offers a scenic beauty with various plants such as pumpkin, tomatoes, carrots, papaya, rudraksh and betel, standing fresh and tall. I treat them like my own children. I talk to them, play music for them and even compliment them, she says, adding, you need to give them back what they give to you.She says that there is immense support and help she gets from her family, friends, and people around her. In my absence, my daughter-in-law sends me pictures of my plants to show me how much they have grown, she says. Similarly my friends, watchman, driver and ironing man, all help me with my garden and get me natural composts such as fruit and vegetable peels, egg shells, ashes from the charcoal, and so on. And it is only with all their help that my garden stands so beautiful today, says Sujatha, adding that she uses only organic compost that is made from kitchen waste, for her garden.Sujatha who lost two of her plants, a fig and pomegranate, says while seeing the struggles of our farmers due to crop failure on the television, we may not feel much for them. But the day I lost two of my plants, I really felt the pain. She has also started the Terrace to Table project. In this, she clicks a photograph of the vegetable from her garden and then a photograph of the dish that she has cooked with it, and then posts it on her organic garden group."

This is where I first ventured into seafood specialities. From 1999 to 2008, I worked in Karavalli, a coastal restaurant in Bengaluru. Karavalli specialised in Goan, Kerala, Mangalore, Karwar and basically coastal cuisines and I took it as an opportunity to polish my skills with seafood. I have participated in food festivals across the country like Taj Bengal, Calcutta in 2003, Taj Banjara, Hyderabad in 2005 and other esteemed establishments like Blue Diamond, Pune and Taj Residency, Delhi. In 2009, I joined Raintree, Anna Salai and I am the sous chef there.My speciality is coastal cuisines and seafood from Kerala, Goa and Mangalore. My favourite dishes that I make best arecrab porichathu and Syrian Chicken curry. But I vote steamed neer dosai with coconut milk as my comfort food. Neer dosai is a popular breakfast in the rural areas of Mangalore. I love to cook for my family, especially my children. I am happy when my customers compliment my dishes andask me to teach them the recipes. I do everything in my capacity to ensure that the guests feel at home and they get what they request.I feel that the use of molecular gastronomy is not a bad thing at all. It has got some negative publicity due to isolated incidents that happened due to incomplete knowledge and inadequate assistance. It creates an entirely new and fun experience for the customers so if there is enough information, why not? Although I would suggest to avoid letting very young kids try it.I am very particular about wasting food and ensure that I discuss with my customers before cooking and always cook according to portions to avoid wastage. To people who are new to cooking, I would a saystart slow and gradually move on to more advanced techniques.

Being from Odisha, my speciality naturally became Odiya cuisine. But I prefer to call myself an Indian chef because I can cook specialities across the country. I acquired my culinary education from IHM, Chennai and started my career at The Residency, Karur. Later, I worked at Accord, Puducherry and now I am at the Paprika cafe in The Courtyard by Marriot, Teynampet.I have been an Oriya speciality chef in all of these establishments. Although I make specialities from across the country, like dal makhni, rogan josh and Awadhi biriyani, I personally prefer Oriya dalma as comfort food. It is made from yellow moong dal and a melange of vegetables. I also like kakhara poi ghanto which is made from plenty of vegetables like pumpkin, spinach, raw papaya, drumstick and potatoes. Maccha besara which is made from fish and other vegetables is also my favourite.Odiya cuisine also features some unique desserts such as chenna pudo, which is a cottage cheese-based dessert sweetened with sugar syrup. Then we have goja which is maida and sugar syrup based dessert. Khassa laddu, which is black sesame seed with jaggery is served after special ceremonies in Odisha. I am against food wastage. Therefore, we cook according to the reservation. Its better to make more if necessary than to end up with excess food.Since we are a business class hotel, the guests tend to stay longer. This gives me the opportunity to build a cordial relationship with them and I try my best to go out of my way to fulfil their requests. If anybody is tired of North Indian cuisine, I make South Indian food for them. I also take custom requests on how they want their food prepared. Recently, a US navy team stayed with us and before they left, they specially asked to meet me. I was hugged and appreciated by all of them for the food and experience we provided them. This is why I love my profession.

I have been an entrepreneur throughout my career, with startups in the food and manufacturing industries. After my stints in the corporate world, I decided to take a leap of faith and decided to pursue my passion for food and cooking.I am a self-taught chef. I do not have any fancy cordon bleu training but I know that our kitchens are, in many ways, the most vital and important space for discourse of all sorts. We learn at the kitchen table. We argue, we affirm, we try to figure things out.As a chef, it is important to know our ingredients, understand them and know how best to use them. One of the ingredients that has intrigued me the most is vinegar. Vinegar has been used is various cuisines for thousands of years. There are records of Egyptians using vinegar to preserve food. Vinegar in dishes improves the flavour, is often used in salad dressings, used in marinades. For me, I love the acidity that vinegar adds to a dish. It gives a complexity and new layer of flavour. No dish better illustrates the virtues of vinegar than a classic gazpacho.To make this cold soup the traditional way, mash chopped tomatoes, red bell peppers with seeds, seedless cucumber, minced garlic and one-day old bread in an earthenware or glass bowl. Place a fine-mesh strainer over a separate bowl, then, working in batches, use a flexible spatula to push the mashed mixture, including its liquid, through the strainer. If you want to save time, use a hand-cranked food mill or a high-powered blender to make your puree. After extracting as much moisture as possible from the solids, discard them. Stir the oil into the strained gazpacho. Taste, add salt and/or vinegar, as needed. Transfer to an airtight container; refrigerate until ready to use. Garnish with diced tomatoes, red and green bell-pepper and white onions and small croutons.The journey from cooking as a hobby to passion and to a full-time profession has involved many such interesting experiments.- Chef KanishkaChef will be curating a menu at the Chef Social Event at Little Green Caf, Museum Road today."

For a few years now, ecologically conscious individuals have been thinking of alternatives for this, and that has resulted in Ganeshas being made with wool, coconut fibre and many other natural materials. Lately, after the popularity of seedballs for afforestation purposes, seedball Ganeshas can be seen doing the rounds. One such green buff, is Ganeshram, who is selling seedball Ganeshas to Bengalureans.The Bengaluru-based naturalist spends most of his time travelling for projects related to water conservation, sustainable food production and conservation of indigenous flora. This is an idea that has been in the air all the while, but with very few people acting on it. I am being helped by my brother and a few friends, and this is my second year at it, he says, adding that the city has really taken to this idea, as the response to his Ganeshas has been overwhelming. I have been swamped with queries for the past few days, and Im glad to see that youngsters and older people alike are opting for these idols. Most are curious to know how it works, and what seeds these idols have, says Ganeshram.They sell Ganeshas of different sizes, ranging from 4 to 12. The 4 idol costs `80, and that, he says, is the one that has been selling the most. The Ganeshas prepared this year by him have a mix of different vegetable seeds such as tomato, brinjal, chilli, ladies finger, mustard and greens such a fenugreek. We have been instructing people to not dump the idols into lakes or ponds, but to submerge them in water vessels at home and pour the mixture into a pot or onto soil. Alternatively, to place the idol in a pot containing soil, in an area receiving a good amount of sunlight and water it everyday, he says. He works along with a potter family near Frazer Town that makes these idols. This system has been working economically for them too, he says.Telling us a bit about the harmful effects of PoP on the environment, he says, PoP does not dissolve in water. Another issue is with various dyeing agents/ paints used on Ganesha idols these days. Many of them are heavy metal-based, and are toxic not just to smaller lifeforms, but also to the humans coming in contact with them. He adds that the food webs and interconnections between various organisms are so intricate in nature that more often than not, we really dont know how it affects the environment. All our anthropocentric inventions solve human needs/wants in the short term, and are generally not oriented towards sustainability or ecology, he says.

The spice mix in the rice is a brilliant blend to say the least. The dish completes itself with peanut butter sauce, fried papad and vegetable satay on the side.The dish is part of ""World Street Food Festival"" at My Fortune, Bengaluru.

The sour cream and salsa dip, both score high on taste and technique.The Chicken Satay with Peanut Butter Sauce is an unusual combination for an Indian palate, but once you dig in, you wouldn't stop with just one bite. The chicken is grilled right with Indonesian spices and the peanut butter sauce adds a tinge of sweetness to the dish.The Eggplant and cheese Fritters are extremely crunchy on the outside and has smooth cheesey texture on the inside with well-cooked aubergine slice layered in. It is served with cumin and olive oil induced pimento sauce. The jalapeno stuffed in the patties lifts the flavour of the ensemble. The Garlic Chicken Wings served as an Italian twist to a Chinese preparation. The meat has chilli flakes on top, is roasted well and has a strong flavour and aroma of olive oil. It isn't too spicy and will suit the taste buds well.The Paneer Khurchan Kathi Roll is a maida roll stuffed with onion, tomatoes and paneer chunks. The fish and chips served on the table was another winner of the evening. The batter fried fish melts in your mouth. The Basa fish is light and the corn flour batter adds crunch to the dish.

Sunnis are feeling lost, unsure what their place will be in the country's future and worried that the Shiite majority and the Kurds aim to change the demographics of some Sunni areas to impose their own control.Sunnis have been barred from returning to their homes in numerous villages and towns that the Kurds seized during fighting with Islamic State militants in a belt of territory across the north stretching down to Iraq's eastern border.Kurdish officials cite security reasons for not allowing residents back, even though IS was driven out of the area late last year. At the same time, the Kurds have repeatedly said they intend to incorporate the captured territory into their own self-rule zone  even as they plan a referendum for outright independence later this month. That raises questions over the future of Sunni Arab villages like Hassan Shami.Further south, Iranian-backed Shiite militias that captured mainly Sunni territory have also kept Sunnis from returning to strategic areas between Baghdad and the Iranian border or other areas Shiites consider vital.Sunni Arabs, meanwhile, are faced with the depth and magnitude of their plight. The fear among Iraqi authorities and the Sunnis themselves is that new militant groups could take root unless the community's situation is improved.Their cities and towns lie in partial ruins from the fight that drove IS out of most of the territories it seized in 2013 and 2014, from northern Iraq through the country's center and across the Sunni heartland of the western Anbar province. Thousands of Sunnis languish in detention for alleged links to the group.The community has suffered massive displacement. Currently, 3.2 million people are displaced, the overwhelming majority Sunni Arabs. Another more than 2 million were displaced previously but have since returned home, according to the International Organization of Migration. Together that would be a staggeringly high proportion of the country's entire Sunni Arab population, which is generally estimated to make up 15 to 20 percent of Iraq's 37 million people.Those who have returned  mainly to Anbar  must rebuild homes and communities, so far with little help from the government. Those still displaced either scramble to find housing or jobs or languish in camps. More than 400,000 of those displaced in nearly a year of fighting to liberate Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, are housed in 19 camps around the north.Sunni Arabs have struggled since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, which brought down Saddam Hussein and opened the door for the Shiite majority to gain power through elections. Sunnis were relegated to second-tier status, igniting an insurgency that brought years of violence and gave rise to al-Qaida and its successor, the Islamic State group. Over those years, divided Sunni politicians were ineffectual, and many Sunni professionals and businessmen left the country.Some Sunnis talk of trying to form their own self-rule region like Kurdistan. But many are wary, knowing the Sunni-majority areas have far fewer resources.""We Sunni Arabs are the weakest link in Iraq today. But trust me, this country will not be stable and strong again unless we assume a leading role in how the country is run,"" said Adnan Abu-Zeid, a school teacher from Mosul.But this kind of bravado masks a widespread despair.""Back in 2003, we wanted democracy and freedoms. Look where that got us,"" said an embittered Ghazi Hamad, displaced from Mosul. ""We have now lowered our expectations. Any government is good for us, as long as it makes us feel safe. We will happily live on the sidelines.""Hossam Ahmed, a 24-year-old student displaced from Mosul, spoke nostalgically of Saddam, though he would have only been 11 when the autocrat was ousted. ""I love Saddam Hussein. When he was in power, we, the people of Mosul, enjoyed full security,"" he said. ""Iraq was finished when he left.""In a sign of resignation and distrust of Shiites, some Sunni Arab tribal chiefs in the north are even publicly campaigning for their areas to join the Kurdish region. The Kurds are overwhelmingly Sunni, but suspicions and divisions run along ethnic lines with Sunni Arabs.The Baghdad government routinely says it wants the displaced to return, and official media celebrate when Sunni Arabs go back to their areas. Officials cite security concerns and lack of basic services as reasons why some do not return.But Sunnis worry over signs of forced demographic change in particular strategic areas.For example, Sunnis have had difficulty returning to parts of Diyala province, which borders both Iran and the Iraqi Kurdish autonomy zone.A recent IOM survey found that nearly 80 percent of Sunnis displaced from two sampled towns in Diyala had tried to return home but were prevented, whether by Kurdish forces or Shiite militiamen.Sheikh Iyad al-Laheibi, a local Sunni tribal chief, said he believes Shiite militias are engineering demographic changes in Diyala to secure a direct route from the Iranian border to Baghdad through the province.""Who gets to return home has become a random practice,"" al-Laheibi said. He also pointed to frequent kidnappings of the Sunnis who remain, believed to be aimed at intimidating them into leaving.In neighboring Salaheddin province, nearly half of those displaced from towns around the provincial capital Tikrit  Saddam's hometown  said they had been blocked from returning by Shiite militias, according to the IOM survey.Southwest of Baghdad, thousands of Sunni Arabs have been unable to return to Jurf al-Sakhar, a Sunni pocket in mainly Shiite Babel province that controls the gateway to the Shiite holy cities of Najaf and Karbala further south. Shiite militias drove IS militants from the area in 2014.Sunni politicians' repeated calls for Sunni residents to be allowed back have been ignored. Last month, the Babel provincial government threatened legal proceedings against anyone demanding their return.Infuriated Sunni lawmakers accused Babel of seeking to change the area's demographics. The U.N. said the Babel government was trying to intimidate politicians into silence.In Khazir camp, Fawaz Ahmed, once a Health Ministry employee, spoke of his secret trips back to his home in Hassan Shami village. Kurdish fighters guarding the village don't allow visits, so Ahmed and others obtain permits to leave the camp, ostensibly to visit relatives elsewhere, and then sneak into their homes.""My heart keeps telling me to go back and look,"" he said, squatting on a large rock at the edge of the camp facing his village. Below, in a ravine running parallel to the Khazir river, youths played soccer on dirt fields as the sky grew darker.""There is only one question on my mind: Why can't I go home?"" he said.In Irbil, Naseradeen Saeed Sindi, the Kurdish official in charge of ""Kurdistani areas outside the region,"" had no direct answer. He said security concerns prevent return for the moment. He also suggested that such captured areas would be made part of the Kurdish self-rule region.""Turkmen, Christians and Arabs will have rights equal to those enjoyed by the Kurds under the region's law,"" he said.In Khazir and other camps, residents languish, dealing with sizzling heat and long hours of boredom in tents lined up in monotonous rows. They talk longingly of ""awda""  Arabic for ""return.""""One's village is like his mother. You can never abandon her,"" said Ahmed Hassan Khalaf, another native of Hassan Shami and a father of 13 who is in his mid-70s and in poor health. ""We used to grow tomatoes on the land on which this camp is built,"" he said, grapping a fist-load of pebbles from the ground outside his tent.Then he murmured, barely audible in despair, ""Oh God, oh God the compassionate."""

Swiss offer insect burgers of mealworm larvae,http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2017/sep/11/yuck-or-yum-swiss-offer-insect-burgers-of-mealworm-larvae-1655390.html,2017-09-11,,The New Indian Express,"GENEVA: Swallow deeply, pinch the nose and repeat the mantra: ""Tastes like beef, tastes likes beef."" Then bite into the burger of rice, chopped vegetables, spices and mealworm larvae.The Swiss supermarket chain Coop, to a bit of domestic hoopla, has begun selling burgers and balls made from insects. It's being billed as a legal first in Europe, a continent more accustomed to steak, sausage, poultry and fish as a source of protein.The goal is to convince leery consumers to try a nutritious, if unusual food that ""preserves the planet's resources,"" Coop says.About one-third of the burger is mealworm larvae. A burger weighing 100 grams (3.5 ounces) has about 10 grams of protein in it  about the same amount found in a child's-size beef burger.For now, only seven of Coop's nearly 2,500 stores in Switzerland are serving up the critters concocted by the Zurich-based food startup Essento. The chain says the insect products have been flying off shelves during their limited rollout in the Alpine nation and a broader launch is planned by year's end.Insect promoters say Switzerland isn't the first European country to allow retail sales, just the first to have those sales so clearly authorized. A change in Swiss law in May allows the sale of three types of insects: mealworm larvae, house crickets and migratory locusts.""It's the first time that a state has authorized human consumption of insects in such a firm, explicit way in Europe,"" said Christophe Derrien, chief of the International Platform of Insects for Food and Feed.Insects can be found on the shelves in Belgium, Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands, but that's due to a ""legal void"" in European Union rules, he said.New legislation taking effect in January will smooth the way for bug burgers to turn up on picnic plates across the EU, however.The chain says it has a policy of not releasing sales numbers, but spokeswoman Andrea Bergmann said the insect burgers and balls ""have been very successful from day one and have been sold out quickly everywhere.""The burger itself has little white specks of rice inside with traces of carrot, paprika, chili powder and pepper. After a hesitant bite, the main flavors that come out are the spices. The texture is curious, a bit like a meaty falafel with a crunch. An aftertaste lingered  but maybe that was just my subconscious playing tricks.The insect burgers, like the meat variety, can be accompanied by buns, tomatoes and lettuce. The insect balls  a mixture of mealworms with cilantro, onions and chickpeas  seem to fit best in pita bread, perhaps with a spoonful of yogurt.The U.N.'s Food and Agricultural Organization has promoted insects as a source of human food, saying they are healthy and high in protein and minerals. The agency says many types of insects produce less greenhouse gases and ammonia than most livestock  such as methane-spewing cattle  and require less land and money to cultivate.Still, there's no telling how long a true conversion in consumer tastes from beef to bug burgers might take  if it happens at all."

""The state produces only one-fourth of its onion requirement. Whatever onion has been produced this year in the state has been exhausted. Now, we are depending on other states such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh,"" food supplies and consumer welfare minister Surya Narayan Patro told The Telegraph. The government had announced on August 2 that it would make onion available at select outlets at Rs 17 a kg and had even threatened to take action against hoarders. It had said that the sellers should not charge more than Re 1 above the purchase price. ""There has been crop failure in Madhya Pradesh, while the crop has not been harvested in Andhra Pradesh. So it is not just Odisha, the entire country is depending on Maharashra at the moment. This crisis is not specific to Odisha. The entire country is facing the problem. At some places, onion is selling at Rs 35 a kg,"" said Patro. The minisyer said the purchase price at the source point was now between Rs 26,000 and Rs 27,000 a quintal. ""After taking the transport cost into account, the selling price in Odisha comes to around Rs 30 per kg,"" he said, adding that he had asked his department officials to sell onion at the government outlets at a price not above Rs 30 a kg. The rise in onion prices following the soaring price of tomato has hit the consumers hard. Last week, tomato was selling at between Rs 80 and Rs 100 a kg in the retail market. ""We have no role to play in the rise in onion price. The price of onion has increased at the source points,"" said secretary of Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda. Traders apprehend that the current high prices would continue till November. ""The winter crop from Nashik will reach the state in November. Besides, onions grown in various parts of the state will also enter the market in the winter and only then will the price stabilise,"" said Panda. Both farmers and traders said the state was suffering because of the lack of adequate cold storages. The state had witnessed distress sale of onions in March. However, the state government had attributed distress sale to over-production."

Ambur Biryani from the erstwhile princely state of Arcot is one of them. The biryani is especially in demand in the northern part of Tamil Nadu as well as parts of Karnataka around Bangalore city.Ambur, a small town in Tamil Nadu known for its leather industry, is located on the way to Bengaluru from Chennai close to Karnataka border. It is said that about a century ago, Hasin Baig, a bawarchi from the kitchens of the Nawab of Arcot relocated to his hometown Ambur and started preparing biryani there with a similar recipe as the Arcot biryani.While the biryani at Nawabs court was prepared in basmati rice, Baig started making his Ambur version for the masses using cheaper seeraga samba rice. The biryani (spelt briyani in Ambur) which was initially sold on bicycles, became so popular that a small shop was set up and people from even outside the town started to flock to this shop. Over the years, this recipe, now known as Ambur Biryani, has spread to parts of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu where it is hugely in demand. Bangalore and Chennai, for example, has many eateries offering this version of biryani.Apart from the variety of rice (seeraga samba rice is known as chitti mutyalu in Telangana), there are other differences Ambur Biryani has with its Hyderabadi counterpart. The meat here is cooked before putting the biryani on dum, and tomatoes are used frequently in the recipe. Also, in the biryani more of spices like cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and green chillies are used yet it is not as spicy as the Hyderabadi variety. Moderate use of tomatoes, coriander and mint leaves gives a uniform colour to the dish.While preparing Ambur biryani, the meat is first pre-cooked with onions, ginger, garlic, tomatoes, curd and whole spices. Separately cooked rice and this meat are then layered in a degh and topped with ghee before putting on dum. In some places the rice and meat are mixed together instead of layering. The biryani is preferably eaten with an eggplant gravy known as kathirikal pachidi.In Hyderabad, a small place in the bylanes of Madhura Nagar near Ameerpet is perhaps the only place serving Ambur Biryani. Pondy Parottas is a 12-seater eatery run by Raja Subbiah and Judith May, a couple from Pondicherry. Known for its Tamilian and Sri Lankan parottas, the outlet introduced Ambur Biryani about a year back and since then there has been no looking back. According to Raja, Ambur Biryani has become the fastest selling dish drawing a steady flow of local customers. He offers variants of this biryani in chicken, mutton kheema, and prawns. Enthused by the response he is planning to start his second outlet in Hi-Tec City soon. Sabyasachi is a food enthusiast and blogs at www.foodaholix.in"

With Bakrid preceding Thiruvonam by two days, on September 1, the trade fairs too began slightly earlier this year, aimed at tapping into the demand of the twin celebrations. ""At a time when the prices of essential commodities are increasing in the general market, the trade fairs really are a boon to the common man; they could aptly be termed 'the people's market',"" said K V Thomas MP, speaking after launching the Onam Trade Fair set up by Supplyco on the Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium premises in Kaloor.Thomas said agencies like Supplyco play a key role in preventing the price hike of essential goods. ""There was a time when wholesale traders use to collect goods from FCI warehouses. But most of them would in turn keep the stock in their own godowns, resulting in increasing number of cases related with the hoarding of goods. They later sell these goods in the black market. This prompted the then government to introduce the Food Safety Bill.This helped government agencies like Supplyco play a major role in providing supplies to the common man,"" said Thomas. The MP said the government is taking a favourable stance towards Supplyco godowns. ""Supplyco should use these favourable conditions for the benefit of consumers,"" said Thomas. ""A new programme named Karshakamithram, mooted to attract more students towards agriculture, will be launched in schools soon. One lakh curry leaf saplings will be distributed on September 11.""THE HIGHS AND LOWS OF ONAMKochi: Every year, the weeks leading up to Onam season are marked by the soaring prices of vegetables. This year, with only about a two week-countdown left for the festival, it is not easy to assess the price trend in the market. Some of the essential vegetables are priced high, but the prices of others, which hit an all time high last month, have come down. For instance, the price of shallots saw a record high price of D140 per kg in July. This month, however, it has come down to D85 per kg. The main reason for the price hike in shallots was the drought in Tamil Nadu from where the produce reaches Kerala. Now, the wholesalers are getting more supply from Andhra Pradesh which is reflected in the reduced price, said N Rajan, a vendor in Kaloor market.However, customers complain vegetables sold cheaply in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka become costly when they cross the border into Kerala. The price increases three or four fold when it reaches here, said Prasanth Jacob, a customer. Raw banana costs only D30 per kg in Coimbatore. However, a customer here has to pay a minimum of D70. Likewise, tomato which is available for D15 per kg in Tamil Nadu gets a weightier price tag here, costing D60 to D70 per kg. The other items that witness a hike in price in August are beetroot, amaranthus, beans, cow pea and drumstick. The price of green chilly and carrot have reduced slightly. ""The prices were fluctuating during the first two weeks of August. However, it is likely to go up by the end of this month, added Rajan.The where and when of fairsSupplyco fairs will be organised in all taluks in Ernakulam. Essential commodities, including red chilly, coriander, black beans, bengal gram, tur dal and vegetables will be available at prices lower than the market price. The trade fairs will function from August 20 to September 3, a day ahead of Thiruvonam. ""There will be special festival offers and gift coupons for consumers,"" said marketing manager R N Satheesh. Every customer making purchases of more than Rs 2,000 will be issued a gift coupon for a lucky draw. The first prize winner will get one sovereign gold, while the state-level winner will get five sovereigns of gold. The vegetable stall at Supplyco fair is set up by Vegetable and Fruits Promotion Council of Kerala. Vegetables like carrot, potato and cabbage are brought from Kanthalloor, Vattavada and Munnar.

And it seems the airline companies have finally understood this universal truth.All the companies are scrambling their menu cards to provide their customers with the ultimate food experience as they fly towards their destinations. The cuisine being offered range from the oriental, continental etc to the local flavours.Among the airlines, Kochi-headquartered Air India Express has gone the extra mile and are giving their passengers the choicest of Malabar food, mainly Malabari poratta and chicken curry from their customised ala carte.Air India Express claims they are the only company in the country which serves complimentary snacks, both the veg and non-veg variety, in the domestic and international routes.We have added varieties like Malabar chicken, meen vattichathu, poratta and chicken to our lunch and dinner menus. These dishes can be ordered only online up to 24 hours prior to the departure of the flight. Bar snacks and starters such as chicken tangri kebab with mint chutney, chicken 65 and chicken nuggets with tomato ketchup rosemary chicken with caramelized onion in multi cereal roll and jeera rice served alongside butter paneer and aloo gobi with salad and gulab jamun are potential enough to tickle the taste buds of passengers, said the spokesperson of the AIE.AIEs inclusion of non-vegetarian dishes in its menu assumes significance considering the fact that Air India, the parent company of AIE, had recently discontinued the supply of these dishes in the economy class its domestic flights as part of cost cutting. The national carrier had also been in news a couple of times for mixing up veg and non-veg orders.According to a report tabled in the Parliament by the Civil Aviation Ministry officials, Air India had mixed up orders three times. Also, the airline had received as many as 44, 27 and 48 complaints in the last three years, regarding the quality of food and catering service. The multiple complaints forced the airline to take appropriate action against the caterer as per the contractual terms.Cost cutting measuresAir India stopped serving non-vegetarian meals in the economy class of its domestic flights as part of cost cutting measures. It also launched various cost cutting measures like a change in menu, meal schedule, rationalisation of dry stores and ancillary items as per current trends.The annual savings which are expected to be made from these measures is Rs 20 crore, said the officials while replying to a query. The annual savings from the discontinuation of non-vegetarian meals in the economy class of Air India domestic flights are expected to be around Rs 8 to Rs 10 crore, said Ministry. Apart from saving cost, it will reduce wastage, improve service and also prevent any chances of mix-ups.This doesnt mean the national carrier is dragging its feet in improvising the airline menu. The airline company has taken steps to improve its catering services by introducing new improved menu, doing away with food items not preferred by passengers, has began training chefs at its international stations on Indian cuisine, taking up passenger and crew feedbacks with the caterers aggressively and monitoring the quality or presentation of meal service closely and making surprise visits to the caterers often. Further, follow ups will be taken for rectifications if a deficiency in the caterers service is noticed, said officials.Local flavours a hitAround 95 per cent of air passengers from Kerala prefer to have local dishes onboard, said Gunasekaran Chandrasekaran, chief chef with Casino Air-caterers and Flight Services, Kochi.Today airlines are putting more emphasis on including as many deshi dishes as possible in their menu. And there has been a good feedback regarding the local cuisine. We have received orders from three major airlines to provide special Onam dishes for its flights to Kerala, he said.Though he refused to disclose the dishes since the airlines are planning the menu as a surprise for their passengers, a senior AIE officer said those flying with Air India Express will be greeted with a special Kerala sweet dish onboard the flight.Experts associated with the flight kitchens also maintain there has been a considerable increase in foreigners who visit the state and nearly all of them prefer to savour the best of the local flavour."
5a1150e19855b76bf13df594,Congress lines up oil 'loot' protests,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170916/jsp/nation/story_173499.jsp,2017-09-16,,Telegraph,"New Delhi, Sept. 15: The Congress has lined up a nationwide campaign against rising prices of petroleum products and food items, accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of squeezing money out of the common man's pocket to fill up government coffers. While there will be a demonstration at Jantar Mantar in Delhi on September 20, at least 10 lakh signatures will be collected for a memorandum to be submitted to the Prime Minister. The signatures will be collected from people at petrol pumps for three days from Sunday. All Congress state units have been asked to devise their own programmes against the rising prices of petroleum products and food items like onions, tomatoes, some pulses and other vegetables. While onion and tomato prices have shot past Rs 50 a kg, some pulses are selling at over Rs 100 per kg even as arhar prices crashed after crossing Rs 200 last year. Congress leader Ajay Maken said at a news conference today: ""If petrol or food items sell at higher prices because of unavoidable circumstances, we can understand. But this government indulges in profiteering by looting ordinary citizens. Petroleum products are a case in point. The domestic prices have soared as international crude oil rates have gone down."" Maken added: ""While the government has given absurd reasons like 'Hurricane Harvey and Irma' for the increase in petrol and diesel prices, it has dealt a devastating blow to the savings of the common people by increasing central excise 11 times in the past three and a half years - 133.47% on petrol and 400.86% on diesel. The government has also robbed 18.11 crore LPG consumers by increasing the prices of subsidised cylinders by Rs 75 in the past three years."" Pointing out that international crude oil prices have come down more than 52 per cent since the Modi government took over on May 26, 2014, Maken said: ""If you take petrol of Rs 100, Rs 51.78 is going to the government in the form of taxes. In diesel worth Rs 100, Rs 44.40 is tax. This is dacoity. Which government punishes citizens to make up for its own (revenue) shortfall caused by wrong economic policies? This is not only insensitive, this is loot."" Maken declared that the Congress ""shall fight this battle to reduce taxes on every available forum"". ""We dare the BJP to come out with a white paper on taxes on fuel and the total gains. The Congress demands immediate withdrawal of excessive central excise duties and other taxes."" Maken stressed that the government had adopted a devious strategy to mislead people by raising prices in small instalments. ""18.11 crore customers purchase subsidised gas cylinders every month. The government decided to increase the price of every cylinder by Rs 4 every month until the subsidy is wiped out. In the last three years, the hike on a gas cylinder was Rs 75. This is done when international price is so low. The UPA government was paying a subsidy of Rs 449 per cylinder to provide relief to the common citizen."""

A long break in rain has heightened prospects of soya crop failure and portends a big trouble for farmers reeling under heavy debt.In past one year, they faced back to back losses, notwithstanding bumper crops of orange and onion. Post-demonetisation, onion was sold for Re 1 before the government stepped in. ""The government woke up too late and started procuring onion at a rate of Rs 8 per kg. By the time the procurement started, thousands of farmers had already sold lakhs of tonnes of onion,"" said farmers in Agar Malwa bitterly.""It should rain soon or the soya crop may damage,"" they said. The district in western MP is known for producing good quality orange, onion and soyabean. Grown over almost 50,000 acres of land, orange crop was hit by demonetisation when traders did not turn up to buy the produce. Availability of onion at dirt cheap rate dealt another blow to growers.Poor rain in the district led to stunted growth of the soya crop. This is happening when many farmers are under debtfrom Rs 1 to Rs3 lakhdepending on the land area under cultivation.A farmer, Roop Narayan is trying hard to save his soya crop. Narayan, who sowed soya between rows of orange plants on 10 bighas of land, says, ""I incurred a loss of Rs 1.5 lakh after spending Rs 3 lakh on onion crop. I had no other option, but to borrow more money from the cooperative societies. I am just praying nothing goes wrong this time.""He said the government should have ""reacted early"" to procure onions from farmers. The decision was taken after more than 15 days, he said. Another farmer Devi Singh could get barely Rs 90,000 by selling onion at Rs 2/ kg. He said the government, which talks a lot about the farmers, should actually do something concrete for them.Jain Singh, another farmer of the region, says, ""We need warehouses for onion and yields like tomato and orange cultivated in the region.""Minister for agriculture Gaurishankar Bisen, however, said, "" Onion procurement benefited 99% farmers. The government also procured urad and moong from farmers. We will always be around to help farmers."""

However, there was disinflation in the food basket.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which factors in CPI for arriving at its monetary policy, had earlier this month slashed the key interest rate (repo rate) by 25 basis points to 6%.Separately, skyrocketing tomato prices propelled inflation at the wholesale level to 1.88% in July from 0.9% in June, with the food category overall contributing significantly to the uptick in WPI terms.Inflation in the food segment of the primary articles category in July came in at 2.15%, snapping a two-month contraction.

Brinjal, too, witnessed a sharp acceleration in inflation to 21.1% in July, from the previous months contraction of 3.1%. Okra ( Bhindi ) saw inflation at 32.4%.What we have to recognise is that these are seasonal influences and are therefore temporary in nature, D.K. Srivastava, chief policy advisor at EY India, said. We must look at core WPI inflation and see if there are any factors pushing it up. Otherwise, this increase will subside shortly. As far as fuel is concerned, there has not been any significant movement in crude oil prices, so that wouldnt put any pressure in either direction, Mr. Srivastava said.The index for Food Articles group rose by 6.2%... due to higher price of fruits and vegetables (29%), peas/chawali (6%), ragi (4%) and condiments & spices, barley, poultry chicken and paddy (1% each), the government said in its release.

5a127ca29855b76bf13e0a61,On a cool jaunt inside an eco-friendly house,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/on-a-cool-jaunt-inside-an-eco-friendly-house/articleshow/60145034.cms,2017-08-21,,The Times Of India,"A cool breeze ruffling your hair on a scorching afternoon in Chennai... not even a fairy tale will ever begin like this. But what if this was a reality? Well, it is, at this four-decade-old, eco-friendly house on Vasu Street, Kilpauk, that runs on solar panels and biogas, follows rainwater harvesting, and grows fresh green vegetables on its terrace-cum-kitchen garden. The terrace is so lush, that you can hear birds chirping even on a hot, still afternoon, and the rustling leaves ensure a cool breeze all day long. That the house belongs to the 73-year-old revolutionary, D Suresh , popularly known as 'Solar Suresh', is the secret here. Suresh, popular across India for his efforts to 'green up' the country, grown eggplants, tomatoes, ridge gourd, lemons, ginger, curry leaves, mint, broad beans, green chillies, radish, cauliflowers, beans, potatoes and bittergourd on his roof. And after successfully implementing all his natural resources project, the man is now ready to come up with a wastewater recycling project that will be capable of treating toilet, household, bathroom and kitchen wastewater into safe potable water right in his home.""It all started when I got to travel to Germany 20 years ago. It stunned me when I saw every house having its own rooftop solar plant. This left me thinking, if a country like Germany, that has a little sunshine, is successfully living on solar energy, why can't a big country like India? Especially if you look at Chennai, we have sunlight throughout the year, imagine how much energy we could produce and utilise in the areas where there is no electricity at all,"" begins Suresh.The IIT-Madras and IIM-Ahmedabad graduate, after working for 18 years in a company that manufactured auto electrical components, decided to give shape to his innovative idea all by himself  at his home. The first move was to approach major companies in Chennai for sponsorship, but none showed any interest. So, he decided to walk down the path all by himself. Says Suresh, ""I'm not a businessman and we need to stop looking at this as 'Return-on-Investment'.""Do you think twice before splurging on movies, shopping or partying? He believes this is one investment that has a larger impact. ""There are many misconceptions about installing solar panels. People think these do not work when it rains, and changing the mindset of people to get them to adapt to this lifestyle change is a major challenge. To prove all the misconceptions wrong and present a successful project to the public, I decided to do it myself. I want to eradicate the problem of solid waste management and if we all install biogas, half of garbage dumping problems will be gone soon,"" he shares.So far, he has installed around 40 solar panels and biogas plants in Chennai, Hyderabad and Bengaluru in various schools, residential areas, old-age homes, hospitals and factories. He works closely with three local vendors who help him set up solar panels, biogas plants and kitchen garden in houses, schools and commercial areas. He ensures that he inspects the places before and after the installation.Suresh installed 1 kilowatt (kW) solar power plant at his home in January 2012, and later in June 2015, he added 2 kWs. In his independent home, everything  from fan, tubelights, computer, mixer-grinder, washing machine, water pump and TV  runs on solar energy. ""I only pay around `600 as my electricity bill for AC and the inverter. Solar plants depend on the UV rays of the sun and not the intensity of the heat. So, even during rains, or when it is drizzling, the UV rays are available. It works perfectly fine during monsoons, too,"" he says witha smile.The simple and low-maintenance method of resource optimisation required `40,000 as a one-time investment in setting up a 1 cubic meter biogas plant that can process about 10kg of waste each day to produce around 40kg of gas per month. Biogas plant requires organic waste like cooked, uncooked, leftover food, vegetable peels, spoilt vegetables and fruits. Suresh collects these from his home, neighbourhood and nearby vegetable shops and hotels. The organic waste is fed to the plants in his kitchen garden as manure. About 20 years ago, he installed an organic filtration tank in his house. ""The rainwater is collected from the terrace and is purified through the organic filtration plant. It is completely potable; the plant consists of layers of pebbles, charcoal and sand. The water can be stored and used for various purposes in our house,"" he explains.Suresh starts his day in his garden  he can be seen with gardening tools in his hands, scraping the manure he prepares with coco peat and sand in equal proportions. ""I am keeping the dry leaves on the top of the soil to retain the moisture  it is called mulching,"" he tells us, and continues doing what he loves the most  gardening and in turn, help saving the nature."

Households, particularly, are groaning under the burden of ever-rising vegetable prices. If it was tomatoes that were making people shed tears a few weeks ago, it is bananas that are now burning a hole in the common mans pocket.Bindu, a homemaker, said banana prices had registered a steep increase and the household budget was being stretched like never before, but they could not do without bananas.The most sought-after nendran variety of bananas cost Rs. 80-Rs. 85 a kg in vegetable outlets on Saturday, as against Rs. 50 a kg a month ago.The Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam on Friday listed the retail price of nendran at Rs. 70, and the wholesale price at Rs. 65.It is not only the price of nendran variety that is going north.A vegetable vendor at Eenchakkal said njalipoovan (rasa kadali) cost Rs. 90 a kg while palayamkodan cost Rs. 50. The robusta variety cost Rs. 45 a kg, and poovan, Rs. 40-50 a kg. The retail price of the kappa variety was Rs. 72 a kg, said a vendor at Karamana. Prices will only increase as Onam approaches, he said.Sadasivan Sugathan, who runs a beauty parlour near the airport, said he bought bananas fewer times a week than earlier.It is not possible to eliminate it altogether because children have to be given fruits as part of their diet. Prices are likely to keep going up in the days to come, he said.A vegetable vendor said he was forced to make do with small-sized rasa kadali from the Chala maret as the average-sized ones were not to be got from the market. Another vendor said the palayamkodan variety was hard to come by.Abdul Rashid, a wholesale dealer at the Chala market, said the wholesale rate was around Rs. 70-74 a kg for nendran.In short supplyThe supply of Wayanad variety of nendran that had been reaching the market for the past couple of months had nearly stopped.We have some stock and are selling it for Rs. 64, he said.A retail vendor in the Chala market said the matti variety of banana used for payasams and other desserts cost Rs. 200 a kg.Even raw plaintain cost Rs. 50 for half a kg, another vendor said.At a Horticorp outlet at Poojappura, the nendran variety cost Rs. 80, and rasa kadali, Rs. 110 a kg. Palayamkodan, which usually could be bought for Rs. 30 a kg, was priced at Rs. 50 a kg.The vendor said once the government intervened in the market in time for Onam, the prices would come down in the open market too."

Road, in Malleswaram and other areas.The KSPCB had first banned PoP idols and their immersion in waterbodies in 2014. The ban was reintroduced in 2016, but stating a delay in communication, idol makers approached KSPCB with a plea to permit sale of idols that had already been manufactured. The KSPCB temporarily relaxed the ban on the condition that the idols be scientifically disposed. It reiterated that a complete ban would come into effect this year.Lakshman, chairman, KSPCB, told The Hindu , The board had directed the BBMP and other municipal corporations to ensure that the ban is followed in letter and spirit. It is their responsibility to ensure enforcement by conducting raids and inspections. But this was not done. If the direction is not followed, KSPCB will take appropriate action against the bodies.Stating that the authorities concerned have not done much to enforce the ban, N.S. Ramakanth, member, Solid Waste Management Expert Committee, BBMP, said, The KSPCB has conducted half a dozen meetings in this regard, but has not been able to achieve anything. As citizen representatives, we recommended placing boards at waterbodies stating that immersion of PoP idols will not be allowed. Except near Yediyur lake, this has not been done anywhere else. With PoP idols already making it to the markets, we foresee lake pollution this year as well.An eco-friendly messageAround 150 civic leaders trained by Bangalore Political Action Committee (B.PAC) have been conducting awareness programmes in their respective neighbourhoods. Apart from this, we are conducting make your own clay Ganesh workshops in 20 wards. We have already covered 11 wards, including B.T.M. Layout, Koramangala, Shanthinagar, K.R. Puram, and made around 2,500 clay idols. In the next two days, we will be covering the remaining wards, said Sushma Mahabala, programme head, B.PAC, which has roped in artists from Karnataka Chitrakala Parishad to conduct the workshop.From Ganesh to a plantA Ganesh that grows into a plant remains a popular eco-friendly innovation. Sasya Ganapathi, a company started by four friends this year, has created and sold 1,000 such Ganeshs.Ganesh Chathurti is something that most people celebrate. We thought we could spread a green message through the festival. Thus was born Sasya Ganapathi, says co-founder Bharath Srinivas.The kit includes a 1 ft clay Ganesh idol, which is filled with fertiliser and a potting mix. Pot and seeds are provided separately.After the festival, people can immerse the idol in the pot. When it dissolves, the fertiliser mixes with the soil, following which seeds can be added. We offer tulsi, ladies finger and tomato seeds, said Mr. Srinivas. A year of experimenting preceded the launch of the product.Another start-up  GrowShareSustain  has come out with a similar concept where a clay Ganesh idol is a seed ball. After the festival, the idol can be immersed in a container. As the idol dissolves, the seed balls merge into the clay and soil. With enough sunlight and water, saplings will sprout within a week."

The reason? All kinds of veggies required for Onam, whether it be tomato, ladies finger, chilly, brinjal, cucumber or varieties of spinach, are ready for harvest at their own vegetable garden, located in their office complex!The initiative, launched by the secretariat officials under the agriculture department's scheme Onathinu Oru Muram Pachakkari , envisages mass cultivation of organic vegetables. And, it has turned the secretariat officials, including seniors, into 'green volunteers'. The small stretch of land near the Durbar Hall at Kerala Government Secretariat complex has around 500 grow bags while more than a 1000 grow bags have been placed on the terrace of the secretariat annexe-II building complex.But it is not just about the vegetables but also about the joy of farming, says Satheeja VR, convener of the Kerala Secretariat Employees Association Vanitha subcommittee. ""The majority of the employees working here in the various sections are not Thiruvananthapuram natives. We live in rented apartments or houses and don't get the time or space for cultivation. But the sight of the tender vegetables sprouting from the grow bags set makes our day,"" says Satheeja.During breaks, plants are the subject of discussion. ""The main enemies of vegetables are the green caterpillars, which eat the leaves. I used to squash them with my fingers while tending the plants. The employees were disgusted with that but now they are so concerned about the plants that they have started to do it themselves. Agriculture minister VS Sunil Kumar has been our greatest support,"" says N Suresh Kumar, secretariat garden supervisor.The first harvest, of the vegetables planted a month earlier, was in the first week of August. ""We put up an organic vegetable counter at the secretariat garden office, which opens at 4 pm every day. Public have to pre-book if they want to buy the fresh organic veggies from the secretariat garden. We sell them in small vegetable kits, at nominal prices. The next harvest, including that of leafy vegetables, will be done in the coming weeks,"" adds Suresh.The employees have formed an active social media group named 'green volunteers'. Suresh says, ""The group has around 100 members, and they share photos of the veggies grown in their houses, while some post queries on pest attacks. Instant remedies are suggested!""Organic farming is also a means by which government employees can exercise their social responsibility, observes Kerala Secretariat Employees Association general secretary M S Bijukuttan . ""It sends out a message to the public to make organic farming part of their lives. We have kept a vithupetti or seed box which anyone can access. We consider this a beginning to re-establish the farming culture and to make available safe-to-eat vegetables,"" Bijukuttan says."

The two are inseparable for him. He talks about sustainability and growing the business with equal zeal. Seven years ago, when he visited India and set a target of doubling the business while halving the environment footprint, it was considered audacious. Ask him for a scorecard and he is happy to share the numbers. Unilever's Indian subsidiary, Hindustan Unilever HUL ) has doubled its business during this period, while also delivering on some of the goals on inclusion, which are more long term and moving.But Polman, a Dutchman who previously worked with Nestle and Procter & Gamble, believes there's enough to be done. The Rs 35,000-crore maker of Dove soaps and Surf Excel detergent , in which Unilever holds 67%, looks for an encore.""I am prudently confident of the opportunity to double our business in India in the next 7 years. What we have done in the past 7-8 years is created the same business of what we have created in the previous 100-plus years. Now we are going to do that again. We think the country gives us that opportunity and, actually, we are part of creating that opportunity. So it's a wonderful symbiosis,"" Polman tells TOI, in an exclusive interview, amid a hectic schedule that included visits to consumers in some of Mumbai's slum areas, business review meetings and a town hall for Leverites at the FMCG major's head office based in the western suburbs.While Polman appears to be satisfied with HUL's performance, nagging competition from new players like Patanjali Ayurved has forced the FMCG giant to become more reactive. It hurriedly launched a full range of Ayush in nine months  from conceptualisation stage to national launch  in an attempt to stop Patanjali in its tracks.Couldn't HUL have been more proactive? ""If Ford knew what the car would do to a horse buggy, he would have introduced it earlier,"" says Polman, exhibiting a rather nonchalant demeanour. ""It's not important to be first, it's important to be right. All I see is making it big. Our business has doubled. We clearly saw priorities and we had opportunities in tea, ice cream, food, personal care and home care. We have had a great run to create another Hindustan Unilever. We are not dissatisfied the way the business went. Ayush has good potential in India.""There couldn't be a better endorsement for the newly launched Ayush toothpaste. Polman is a new convert and has taken back tubes of Ayush toothpaste which he sampled while in Mumbai. To that extent, Polman chuckles, he's already taking the brand ""global"". ""But we need to build the brand (Ayush) here where there is so much potential. If we see the success here, I have no doubt other countries will pick up on that. Pureit (an Indian innovation in water purifier) is a big brand in China and it's getting into other countries as well,"" says Polman.Local innovations certainly excite Polman who believes those days where consumer trends could be picked up from US and Europe to predict what would happen in markets like India, are gone.""Innovation can come from anywhere and usually from developing markets because people are more entrepreneurial here. There's also a younger population outside Europe and US. In China, the internet is far advanced than in the US. In India, Ayurveda is taking off and is an enormous opportunity. These markets are much quicker to leap frog to the best and often premium products. Here, hair care is moving towards premium more than developed markets,"" he says.On Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP), Polman says it's on track. ""If you look at our business (Unilever global), the hard numbers our share price and our returns to shareholders have been three times in this period of nine years. So our USLP is well on track and delivering on the stretched targets that we have set for ourselves. We have over half of our materials that are now sourced sustainably, 100% of tomatoes in India and about 45% of our tea is sourced sustainably, all of our factories are zero waste and we are moving quite rapidly to green energy. I think for many of these aspects because we had set ambitious goals, we have made a difference.""However, Polman, who came close to becoming a priest before he plunged into the depths of the business world, claims he is no oracle of Delphi. But some of his predictions have been bang on. When he took over as CEO of the Anglo-Dutch multinational in 2009, the developed markets were reeling under a recession. He then said 75% of Unilever's growth would come from market development, 75% will come from personal care and that developing and emerging (D&E) markets would contribute 75% to Unilever's turnover by 2020. Of these, Polman has managed to get the first two predictions right. But D&E markets are still at 60% of Unilever's turnover.""The reality is, actually more of our growth has come from the emerging markets because Europe and US have not performed that well. I was hoping we would have 75% of our business in emerging market in ten years - so I still have about 2-3 years to go on that. But we are at 60% despite having done M&A activity in developed markets (Alberto Culver, Dollar Shave club, Seventh Generation). We made these acquisitions to increase our footprint in Europe and US. If you take those acquisitions out, we would be higher than 60% (D&E percentage of total),"" he says.With weakening currency and other economic factors, emerging markets began to feel the pressure and slowed down. But the goal remains the same. ""Since 80% of the population is going to live outside of Europe and US, the bulk of the growth will come from the D&E markets. We will have the bulk of our business in D&E. When I started, D&E was 45% and now it's at 60%. You will see urbanisation continuing to be a driver in developing markets. So if we do our jobs well, we will definitely have 75% of our business in ten years in D&E,"" says Polman.Altruism comes naturally to Polman. In a world where CEO salaries are only going northwards, Polman's has remained unchanged. He believes leaders shouldn't work for money.""The moment I came into the company, I made it clear to my board that despite Unilever results, I don't want to get paid more. The reality is since I joined the company 9 years ago, I have the same salary. I get paid enough and have a great lifestyle. Salary for me is not a driver. Contrary to what people think that CEOs work harder if they get paid more is a load of baloney. All CEOs when they become CEOs already have enough money to retire. So we are volunteers,"" says Polman, who turned 61 this year and talks about his retirement have already begun.Will his successor continue with the same strategy? Polman, who had succeeded Patrick Cescau, who first talked about 'brand imprint', is not worried about USLP (Unilever Sustainable Living Plan), which he says, is by now ingrained in the DNA of Unilever. ""From the moment I joined this company, I had to think about succession. We have a much stronger bench and team leaders. We have people here like Sanjiv (Sanjiv Mehta, MD & CEO, HUL) who have incredibly challenging assignments. We have a cadre of people who could step into my job any time and continue to do successful things,"" he says.He, however, holds on to his strong views and rejects business models meant merely for ""a few billionaires"". This year, Polman successfully staved off a surprise $143-billion bid by US food company Kraft Heinz , controlled by billionaire Warren Buffet and private equity firm 3G Capital, to acquire Unilever.He believes business can actively make a positive contribution to society. ""Unfortunately, we have too many businesses only staying around now for shorter terms. The average length of a publicly traded company in the US is 17 years. It used to be 60 years,"" says Polman. The reason, according to him, is because they are just narrowly focused on shareholder and have totally forgotten what it is all about.""I would hope, as I move on, that people would say that Unilever is a model that shows business can be run differently. That it doesn't have to be to the benefit of a few, that its value and values is to the benefit of the billions and not billionaires, that you can have business play a key role in creating a sustainable and more equitable world, that business can play a key role in alleviating poverty,"" says Polman, who personally went to the White House to convince them to be part of the Paris climate deal.""We didn't succeed but I would have felt worse had we not tried,"" he says."

Soon, a group of Patidars followed them to the police station and forced cops to release them. The rioters were also booked for damage to public property, wrongful confinement, mischief by fire or explosive substance and assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty.The trouble began when around 300 Patidar members gathered outside BJYM event on Vallabhacharya Road, where the outfit's president Rutvij Patel was present. They started pelting stones and hurled eggs and tomatoes at police too.

First, he bought one acre of land to augment his familys 0.75 acres (30 guntas) in Sanganakeri village of Gokak taluk in Belagavi district, and then chose an elite variety of tomato, the Arka Rakshak, to cultivate.The young man, who was ridiculed by seasoned farmers for chasing his dream, is now a household name. He made nearly Rs. 10 lakh in four months. I have harvested a bumper yield of 43 tonnes and am expecting another 8 to 10 tonnes from the remaining crop, which is a record in this region, says Mr. Sunil, whose mantra in farming is determination and application of scientific practices.In honour of his success the Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR) organised a field demonstration day at his farm to popularise scientific methods of cultivation of this high-yielding variety.IIHRs Vegetable Division Head A.T. Sadashiva, who headed the team of scientists that developed the Arka Rakshak, says this variety has resistance to three major diseases besides having a long shelf-life. He also believes this variety, which yields 18 kg a plant, can bring financial stability to small and marginal farmers.

Travelling from one place to another means arriving in the particular culinary pleasures offered by that destination, but it also means that a new sector of deprivation opens up simultaneously. If you happen to be visiting somewhere for a short period, then this is fine: you enjoy the local foodings in all their pomp and peculiarity, and then you move on before the lack of this or that makes itself felt. The problem arises when you go somewhere for a stretch, say, for a couple of months, and bits of your taste-bud operating system begin to experience small glitches.Within India, coming home to Calcutta, I can find some of the best variations of north Indian dishes, the vegetarian items as well as the biryanis, kebabs and the meat and chicken gravy dishes, but I can never find the perfect naan or lachha parantha that I get in Delhi or its environs. Vice versa, there was no question of getting decent Bangla food in either Delhi or Bombay, barring enclaves like Chittaranjan Park. This much is easy to understand: while some taste-things manage to travel from their home base, others dont. While some foods drop roots (including supply chains for ingredients that need to be brought from the original territory), others find it impossible (example, think how idli-dosai have become equally authentic all over India).Half a mealThe next thing thats also more or less understandable is what happens when you carry with you some precious food to eat far away from its point of origin. So, you come home to your warm tropical city and quickly refrigerate the four kinds of French cheese youve brought back. You call friends over, they bring wine, bread, crackers, and you open the cheese. There is the pleasure of serving and eating foodstuff that are once again rare, but theres something missing. Maybe its the exact bread that goes with the cheese or maybe its the taste of the wine, but you end up feeling that youve had a sort of half or three-quarters meal, with bits missing in the middle.Flip it around and things abroad can get similarly strange. There is the well-worn joke which starts with the question, Hey, where do you get the best Indian food in Paris? The answer goes: Head for Gare du Nord, take a Eurostar train to London Kings Cross, come out and turn right. Drummond Street with its desi eating joints is right there. Paris may have some of the best food in the world, but a cosmopolitan hub of international cuisine it is not, especially as far as affordable subcontinental food is concerned. If Paris is lacking in this regard, Berlin is even worse. The city is now full of boards proclaiming Indisches Restaurant, but if youre a desi, you want to avoid most of these. Spending some time in Berlin, I got lucky: around the corner from where I was staying was a small Indian restaurant run by a Bangladeshi man who spoke fluent, idiomatic Hindi. We struck up a cordial relationship and my friend would make sure the dishes he served me and my companions were as fresh and non-industrial as possible. While far from great desi khana , coupled with my own cooking this was good enough to tide over my home food cravings.Germany, a cornucopia of foodHowever, as I kept sternly reminding myself, I wasnt in Berlin to miss Indian food. Germany has some of the best bread, great cheese and sausages, and, along with the Czechs and Belgians, simply the best beer on the planet. Besides, the huge Turkish presence means a wealth of doner and kebap shops; other West Asian and Asian populations provide a whole variety of reasonably priced non-European grub. Added to this, there are, of course, the usual suspects of variously priced burger joints and purveyors of pizza and pasta. If you want a change from the beer, European and non-European wine is widely available at much cheaper prices than in the U.K. and certainly back home. All in all, Berlin (and a couple of other parts of Germany that I visited) is a cornucopia of food and drink. Nevertheless, after nearly two months, I began to feel some some sense of missing that I couldnt quite place.Coming back from Berlin to London, one of the first things I found myself buying were sandwiches from the supermarket: egg and cress, bacon, lettuce, and tomato, and even the very Germanpastramiandsauerkraut. Among the first places in which I found myself eating out were my favourite pizza joints. Despite coming from one of the worlds best pork-producing countries, I found myself loading packets of English bacon for breakfast at home. Soon, I will come away from all this foreign food. At home await both ghastly pizza delivery fraudsters and the wonderfully chilli-hot Chinese sausages from Kalimpong, both extortionately priced Indian wine and the winter gifts of sarson ka saag and missi roti , both the crap psuedo Chinese and Thai food and Gujju Bajri no rotlo and gawl (gur) and the Bong luchi and kosha maangsho . No doubt after a month of so of quaffing aloo parantha in Delhi, or idli-dosai all over the home country, Ill find myself double missing the sandwiches in London and the lovely, dark bread, cheese and salami in Berlin."

I can imagine what her dining table would look like  laden with some of the best known dishes of Bengal, from fish and mutton preparations, to fries and cutlets, stuffed vegetables and chutneys.Being a card-holding feminist  let me remind new readers that I protested in front of a Miss India pageant many years ago  I do not belong to that school of thought which states that the best chefs are always men. Though some of my best friends are men who cook, and rather well, I hold with high regard women who have been cooking delicious stuff  and writing about it, too. Consider all these names from Bengal  Bunny Gupta, Jaya Chaliha, Minakshie Das Gupta, Chitrita Banerjee, Satarupa Banerjee. I rely on their books whenever I want to try out something interesting from Bengal.And now I think I need to get some recipes out of Iti Aunty, who is based in Kolkata and is known to wield a mean ladle. I had a special thaala  thats thaali in Bengali  curated by her at the Monkey Bar the other evening, and have been licking my fingers ever since. The festival  on from tomorrow (September 24) to September 30  is a Puja special that also seeks to celebrate what is called pate puja in Bengal, or worshipping the stomach.I am, as you know, very fond of the Monkey Bar. The CP outlet has shut down, but the one in the Vasant Kunj Market is so full of life that I feel years younger whenever I am there. Theres loud music, no doubt, but the lights that glitter from funky chandeliers, the great menu and the friendly staff all make for a very happy meal.And I had a very, very happy meal when I was invited to try out Iti Auntys Pujor Special Thaala. There are three kinds of platters on offer  with fish (Rs. 1299 plus taxes), with chicken (Rs. 1199 plus taxes), and vegetarian (Rs. 999 plus taxes). Every thaala has in common aloor dom, a Bengali variation of dum aloo, flavoured with cumin and other spices, begun kasundi, which is an eggplant dish with a sharp mustard flavour, plastic chutney, cooked with raw papayas, and tomato chutney.I opted for the fish thhaala which also included fish kachori, bhoona khichri with fried mourola fish, steamed prawns wrapped in pumpkin leaves, fish cutlet and kamala bhetki. Each one was delicious.The gravy in the kamala bhetki was lightly flavoured with oranges, so it was mildly sweet, as Bengali food can be. The prawns were sharp with mustard and the fish cutlet  with mashed boneless fish mixed with potato, crumbed and fried  was just right.I have had various kinds of kachoris, or Bengali kochuris, but the fish kochuri was one of a kind, with a filling of mashed bhetki. The kachori, soft and puffy like a puri, was absolutely superb. I enjoyed the khichri immensely, too. It had been cooked with the fragrant gobindo bhog rice and moong dal, flavoured with ghee and topped with fried onions and fried mourala fish.Mourala is a small fish that I think is best eaten when fried with just a coating of salt, chillies and turmeric. Here they had put a besan batter around the fish. The problem with the fish is that it has to be eaten fresh off the kadhai, because if kept out for a while, it goes limp in this weather.The kasundi  a strong and mildly bitter mustard sauce  gave the begun kasundi a nice kick and I happily finished off the plastic chutney  so called because of its light, translucent look.The chicken thaala includes mughlai porotas, flaky, fried bread that Calcutta is known for, bhoona khichuri with chicken meatballs, chicken chop, chicken kosha and omelette curry, which is a great Bengali favourite of omelette pieces in a light gravy.The vegetarian thaala has luchi, or maida puris, parwal stuffed with cottage cheese, dhokar dalna, steamed dal cakes in gravy, sukto, a light vegetable mix, mildly bitter and sweet, steamed rice, apart from the four common dishes.The platter didnt come with a sweet. I told Chef Himmat, the man on the spot, hed have a mini Bengali rebellion at hand if there was no dessert. I got a call yesterday to say that mishti doi has now been added to the platter  which I think is a great idea.This may sound corny, but I have just two words for the festival  De taali.Address: Plot No 11, Pocket C 6 & 7, Commercial Complex Vasant Kunj; Tel: 011 41095155; Open from noon to midnight (those under 25 years are only allowed till 6:00 pm)"

I hope it rains well the years prediction is 96 per cent average rainfallWill we surpass last years production figures?That depends on the progress of the monsoon. Last year was good with 1,456 mm rainfall. The total production of paddy was over 50 lakh tonneYou deal with agro-meteorologyYes, agro-meteorology is the study of the impact of various weather parameters like temperature, rainfall, humidity, cloud cover, moisture and evaporation on agriculture. The idea is to use the information to enhance crop productionHow does it help farmers?It is a part of the Centres Grameen Krishi Mousam Seva run by the Indian Meteorological Department. It issues forecast and farm advisories through bulletins every Tuesday and FridayHow helpful are the bulletins?Farmers get advance information about the weather. The bulletins reach farmers via SMS, emails andpersonal contactHow do the advisories help farmers plan farm strategy?IMD also issues long-term forecasts about expected rainfall. Farmers can plan strategy using that advisoryThe state government dug a large number of dobas (farm ponds) last year. Did these help?They helped recharge ground water levels and supported farming.AS TOLD TOAchintya Ganguly"

A look at how Darjeeling is coping: Long marches Hill residents are walking the extra mile, literally, to keep their hearth burning. A vegetable trader who didn't want to be named said he woke at 4.30am every day and walked 10km to Jorebungalow, and then walked back carrying 30kg to 40kg of vegetables to sell in Darjeeling. ""At night, villagers from various places bring vegetables that are stocked at Jorebungalow,"" he explained. ""Earlier, all we did in the morning (in Darjeeling) was unload the vegetables from the trucks. Now, with no transport, we need to do a lot of legwork. It takes us between one hour and 90 minutes to make it from Jorebungalow with the load."" Today, the trader and his friends carried back cabbage and squash. The shortage has raised vegetable prices by Rs 10 to Rs 20 a kilo. But it's not just the traders - almost every Darjeeling resident is walking a lot more. It's become an unwritten rule that at least one member from each family should attend the Gorkhaland rallies being held every day. ""Attending the rallies is the least we can do for the cause,"" said Sharmila Tamang, a regular. Once the rallies are over around noon, the hunt for vegetables and other rations begins: which means some more walking up and down the hills. Almost every third woman one sees on the town's streets is carrying a shopping bag. ""The bag is always with me these days - who knows when I might chance upon some vegetables?"" a woman said. A resident of Darjeeling's Raj Bari neighbourhood said: ""How long can one watch TV or stay indoors? After the rallies, my friends and I often walk as far as 10km to the town's outskirts, searching for vegetables, mutton and any other edibles."" Rare bird Chicken, most of which used to come from the plains, has virtually vanished off the tables. ""Mutton, pork and beef can be sourced from the countryside but chicken, which used to be the most easily available meat in town, is a struggle to find,"" a resident said. An official at the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park said: ""We need 70kg to 80kg meat every day for the animals. While we are getting mutton and beef, there's no chicken; so we can't rotate the menu like we did."" Among vegetables, the choice is limited to squash and its tendrils, watercress, cabbage and potatoes. ""I have occasionally been able to find beans. My family wasn't too fond of watercress before, but nowadays they don't grumble much,"" a woman said. New nightlife Darjeeling was known to sleep early and silent. Now it's making a beeline for the markets after dark. The night is when food stocks mostly reach the hills, clandestinely - eluding what many allege are the authorities' efforts to stall food lorries at Siliguri to spite the agitation's spearheads. ""The moment the rations come and we open our shop, the stock vanishes,"" a shopkeeper said. Samaritans Hardship has kindled the spirit of humanity. ""With likeminded friends, I have formed a loose group called the Darjeeling Initiative (DI). We are distributing free rations in the villages,"" said Arbin Subba. Pooling their own money with donations from the well-off, Subba and his friends are buying food stocks from the plains, where they have contacts, and distributing packets containing 10kg rice, 500gm lentils and edible oil in hill villages. ""Since July 5, we have reached 224 households covering 14 villages in Okayti, Durpin and Thulung Gaon in Mirik subdivision. Today, we reached out to at least 100 households in Nagri,"" Arbin said. A Darjeeling district court lawyer who lives in Lebong, around 7km from town, said: ""I come to court with my bag full of vegetables and other foodstuff for my friends and acquaintances in Darjeeling every day. Sadly, I have run out of petrol for my two-wheeler from today."" Disconnected The Internet ban imposed since June 20 - officially, to prevent rumour-mongering; allegedly, to prevent mobilisation of agitators - has virtually cut most hills people off from the outside world. ""I can't connect with friends and family members outside the hills. I even have to ration my phone calls; who knows when I might have the next chance to top up my phone credit?"" a college girl said. ""Outstation friends have recharged my credit but you can't ask them to do it again and again."" The Internet ban and lack of transport has left many students struggling to apply for admission to colleges outside the hills. Even local TV channels have been barred from airing. Local news is a trickle now, adding to the day-to-day frustration. Some are attempting to beat the Internet blues. ""Sikkim and Nepal are helping us cheat the Internet ban, but we need to climb up the hills to vantage points to receive signals from Sikkim towns. The data speed is slow and, today, we had no signals from these towers, either,"" said Akash, a college student. On the plus side, social bonding is improving. ""People are now stepping out to socialise. We all gather at one of our neighbours' place in the evening, discuss the agitation and share meals,"" a resident said. ""This is a spirit Darjeeling had lost but is reviving now. Our neighbourhood is turning out to be one big family in this hour of crisis. 'Class' divide The children are probably the happiest lot. With the schools (and colleges) closed since June 15, it's been all play for them, with just a little studying at home. Darjeeling, which hardly offered children any open spaces, has turned into a vast playground, with cricket and football having free run of its streets. The parents are worried, though. ""My son will be taking the ICSE exams next year: I'm concerned how long this strike will last and whether his school will be able to teach the full syllabus,"" a parent said. A group of 11 teachers and some local youths are holding classes for 150-odd students at Takdah. ""Since June 18, we have been teaching them free of charge at the Sirigaon forest community hall and the Tiny Angels School, from 10am to 2pm every day,"" said Trideep Basnet, a teacher. Silver lining A homemaker said the shutdown had opened a window of opportunity for her. ""Every morning, my milkman now delivers not just milk to me but also vegetables, cereals and other foodstuff from his village,"" she said. ""I have begun selling them in front of my home at a small profit. My stock of ginger, garlic, tomatoes and chillies sold out in no time today."""

Picture by Uttam Kumar Pal Naveen gesture NCC cadets take part in a tent pitching competition during a training camp in Rourkela. Picture by Uttam Kumar PalnArch-rivals BJD and BJP welcomed the NDAs presidential candidate Ram Nath Kovind in Bhubaneswar on Friday. However the BJD, despite its support for Kovind, sought to maintain a distance from the BJP and interacted with the NDAs nominee separately at the conference hall in the Assembly. Nevertheless, when it came to the photo session, chief minister Naveen Patnaik held and raised the hand of not only Kovind, but also J.P. Nadda, Union minister and senior BJP leader who had accompanied the former. Though some BJD leaders might have frowned at this, it was widely seen as a gesture of courtesy that drew praise. Predator mess Forest and environment minister Bijayshree Routray is said to be unhappy with his officers, who are yet to catch the animal attacking sheep at Niali and in other areas of the state. Aware of the rising public anger against the authorities on the issue, he is learnt to have given the top mandarins of the department a piece of his mind, but they appear to be helpless. We have stepped up our vigil at Niali and in other areas, where the attacks have taken place. We can catch the predator if it is sighted. When no one has seen it properly, how can we hope to trap it? said a hassled forest officer on duty at Niali. Too costly Tomato prices have gone through the roof leaving consumers in a tight spot. They are fuming at the governments alleged insensitivity with neither agriculture minister nor the food supplies and consumer welfare minister coming to their rescue. While agriculture minister Damodar Rout washed his hands off the price rise blaming it on lack of marketing facilities which, he said, did not fall within his departments purview, food supplies minister Surya Narayan Patro has sought to downplay the issue describing tomato as a non-essential commodity and the price rise a nationwide phenomenon. They dont realise how it has affected the middle class with tomato prices soaring to Rs 80 a kilo from Rs 8 a kilo a month ago, said a homemaker. Open secret Though now it is more than obvious that UPA presidential nominee Meira Kumars visit to Bhubaneswar to meet state Congress MLAs was cancelled because of the continuing tug of war between the Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee (OPCC) and the Congress Legislature Party, some party leaders have sought to make light of it. Party chief whip Tara Prasad Bahinipati, who shares a strained relationship with OPCC president Prasad Harichandan, raised many eyebrows when he described Kumars visit as unnecessary because party MLAs were going to vote for her anyway. Its true that party legislators will vote for her but we all know what scuttled her visit, said a senior Congress leader. Lonely leader Former minister Bimbadhar Kuanr, who had ended his old ties with the BJP to join the BJD three years ago, seems to be ploughing a lonely furrow in his adopted party. If sources close to the leader are to be believed, the veteran from west Odisha, who had held many important positions during his time with the BJP, is hardly ever seen in programmes organised by the ruling party.However, since he had quit the saffron outfit accusing its leadership of ignoring him, he will find it hard to make a comeback. Besides there has to be some excuse for going back. At the moment he cant think of anything, said a sympathiser of the beleaguered leader. FOOTNOTE Damodar Rout Back in the game Criticism of his rather loose tongue notwithstanding, agriculture minister Damodar Rout continues to enjoy the confidence of chief minister Naveen Patnaik. In fact, he seems to be having a great run of luck. During Naveens last ministry rejig, he benefited the most by bagging the plum agriculture portfolio coveted by many colleagues. His importance within the ministry has also gone up with him being allotted the seat next to Naveen in the Assembly. Critics had written him off. But he has proved all of them wrong, said a BJD leader. Ashutosh Mishra"
5a1466b39855b76bf13e3e96,A tale of the flying tomato,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170717/jsp/jharkhand/story_162279.jsp,2017-07-17,,Telegraph,"The story of the tomato is one of rags-to-riches in Ranchi. Farmers had been forced to destroy tonnes of this edible fruit - rich in the healthy antioxidant pigment lycopene - in January this year when the supply-demand mismatch dragged down prices to as low as Rs 2 a kilo. By mid-July, the tomato is back with a bang - a rare relish with a premium tag of Rs 100 a kg. President of Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FJCCI) Vinay Kumar Agrawal blamed the monsoon for the abnormal rise in tomato price. ""Increase in rates is not unusual in the rainy season because local farmers depend on import from Bangalore and Nasik. And this year, the supply is also poor; hence, the price is hitting the roof. There will be no relief till the end of monsoon (September),"" he said. It goes without saying that homemakers in the state capital are grappling with their kitchen budget. Pinky Sharma of Upper Bazaar quipped that a curry with tomatoes had become a status symbol. ""I was buying half a kilo for Rs 50 from a vendor and people were looking at me as if I were some maharani (queen). It gave me such complex that I settled for 250gm,"" she chortled. Saraswati Devi, who works at a computer accessories store, said she had switched to bottled ketchup. ""I noticed the price skyrocketing last (Saturday) evening and decided to shift allegiance. While a kilo of raw tomatoes was being sold at Rs 80-100 per kg, a 1kg bottle of ketchup is available at Rs 100-130. The latter is cost-effective because it lasts longer,"" she added. Madhvi Mishra, a resident of Vidyapati Nagar, recalled how an acquaintance had to deal with his 12-year-old daughter's tantrums because he did not buy tomatoes for her birthday party. ""The little girl loves the tangy taste of homemade sauce and couldn't come to terms with the fact that there were no tomatoes on her birthday menu,"" Mishra said. On January 30 this year, farmers of Bundu, protesting against the dearth of cold storage facilities and food processing plants, had destroyed tonnes of tomatoes. Similar protests had taken place at many other places on the outskirts of the capital. Farmer Keshwar Sahu on Sunday said a proper storage and supply plan could alone put a check on abnormal pricing of perishable items. ""Otherwise, the story will be same every year. Tomatoes will sometimes be down to earth, literally, as it happened a few months ago; and sometimes they will be too pricey for consumption like now,"" he summed up.

Picture by Ashwinee PatiTomato prices have soared in the past month, from Rs 25 per kilogram to Rs 100-Rs 110 per kilogram in Bhubaneswar. Lelin Mallick of The Telegraph speaks to traders, residents, and experts to find out the rationale behind the price rise The problem Tomato was being sold at Rs 25 a kilogram in various city markets just a month ago. The state's tomato farmers resorted to agitation in March and dumped quintals of the fruit on the roads to protest against distress sale. The price of the crop had even dipped to Re 1 per kilogram in Keonjhar, Angul and Bargarh during the summer, spurring the Opposition Congress and the BJP to demonstrate against the government. Reason behind the price rise The city is dependant on Karnataka for supply tomato with 20 trucks arriving daily. It has come down to three to four trucks over the past few days. Traders said the city's daily requirement was 100 tonnes of tomato, the supply of which has come down by almost 80 per cent. Traders fear that the price would touch Rs 100 in a couple of days. The city is reliant on Bengal, Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh for the crop. Low yield in Bengal led to a stop in tomato imports to the city. Besides, fresh crop from Karnataka reaches the city in a week. Traders said the state capital never depended on locally grown tomato during monsoon. Price difference The wholesale price of the fruit is Rs 60 per kilogram but when it reaches the retailers, the price rises by Rs 20 (around 30 per cent). Traders attributed the difference to the crop's perishable nature. They also said the crop couldn't be stored for long. Improvement likely Traders said the situation was likely to improve in a week or two. ""We have to wait for fresh produce, either from Karnataka or Himachal Pradesh, which may take another one to two weeks,"" said secretary of the Raw Vegetable Merchants' Association, Kabiraj Swain. State's role The state government attributed sale of tomato at throwaway prices in various districts to over production of the crop. But it had failed to set up adequate cold storages to store tomato, which has been witnessing frequent price rise along with onion. Public opinion ""The crop used to be sold at cheaper rates in the summer, but the state government failed to arrange proper facility to store the crop. If the government had managed to store the crop properly, the price might not have skyrocketed during the rains. Tomato has become a luxury even for the middle class,"" said Deepak Panigrahi, a sales executive and resident of Bhubaneswar."
5a1474bb9855b76bf13e4592,...tomato prices shoot up,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170727/jsp/calcutta/story_164075.jsp,2017-07-27,,Telegraph,"July 26: Rs 40 a kilo in late June, Rs 80 in early July and now a new high of Rs 120. The price of tomato is shooting up faster than the Sensex. The buzz in the markets is that a dip in production across the country has led to a shortfall in supply, coinciding with the season when local produce is not available. The price of tomato has increased by almost Rs 40 a kilo in the Maniktala market since Metro first highlighted the upswing on July 11. The produce currently available in Calcutta markets is mostly from Karnataka. Tomato becomes dearer between late June and early or mid-August, when the city becomes dependent on supplies from Karnataka. The markets are flooded with produce from within Bengal for around five months before that. Several retailers said the price rise this year was abnormal. College teacher Debayan Basu, who lives in Maniktala, bought tomato for Rs 120 a kilo last week. ""I do not remember when I last paid so much for this vegetable,"" he said. Compared to Maniktala, the price of a kilo of tomato is at present lower in New Market (Rs 80) and Lake Market (Rs 90). Abhijit Kumar Nandi, head of the department of agricultural economics at Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswa Vidyalaya, linked the abnormal price rise to less than normal production in the last crop year (July to June). ""During the 2015-16 crop year, tomato production in India was very good, because of which farmers did not get the price they expected,"" he said. After taking a price hit in the 2015-16 crop year, wary farmers apparently scaled down production in the subsequent year, which meant less supply to markets like Bengal. ""The total area under tomato cultivation was smaller in 2016-17 because farmers did not want a rerun of 2015-16. They preferred growing other crops instead. They feared that they may again incur losses if supply of tomatoes is higher than demand,"" Nandi said. The second factor in the price rise is that produce from Bengal has long disappeared from the markets. Tomato is grown in the state in winter. During that period, the price of the vegetable plummets because of abundant supply. Besides farmers reducing the area of cultivation, climatic conditions have had a role to play in the quantity of production this year. Tomato being essentially a cold crop, the shortening of winter is having an effect on productivity."
5a1477d49855b76bf13e47aa,"Wholesale, retail prices firm up",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170815/jsp/business/story_167318.jsp,2017-08-15,,Telegraph,"New Delhi, Aug. 14: Retail as well as wholesale inflation turned sharply higher in July, but remained far below the RBI's comfort level of 4 per cent, adding noise to the clamour for lower rates. Retail inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), jumped to 2.36 per cent in July on a yearly basis after easing for three straight months. The rise in the CPI was driven by hardening of prices in sugar and confectionery items, pan, tobacco and intoxicants. However, there was disinflation in the food basket. The RBI, which factors in CPI for arriving at its monetary policy, had earlier this month slashed the key interest rate (repo rate) by 25 basis point to 6 per cent. However, the industry expects a bigger rate reduction. Another macro-economic indicator for July showed that the wholesale price index (WPI) inflation rose sharply to 1.88 per cent - the first rise in five months - as some food articles turned dearer even as the industry pitched for a cut in interest rates citing weak industrial activity. With the prices of tomatoes jumping up sharply in July, WPI inflation in vegetables shot up 21.95 per cent. According to CPI data released by the Central Statistics Office, food inflation saw deflationary pressure at (-)0.29 per cent in July against (-)2.12 per cent in June this year. While vegetable prices in July were 3.5 per cent lower than the same month last year, they have been rising on a sequential basis. The RBI had noted this in its bi-monthly policy review. ""There are now visible signs, however, of the usual seasonal price spikes, even if with a delay and especially in respect of tomatoes, onions and milk,"" the RBI said. However, India Inc believes that there is room for further rate cut by the RBI to boost investments from the private sector and revive industrial growth. Industrial output had hit a four-year low and contracted 0.1 per cent in June, mainly on account of a decline in manufacturing and capital goods sectors. ""Given the trend and outlook for inflation, we see clear space for a more accommodative stance in the monetary policy. This is all the more important, given the state of industrial sector where growth is anaemic,"" said industry chamber Ficci. The mid-year economic survey tabled in Parliament last weak had said that with inflation ruling low, there was scope for reducing the RBI's key policy rate by 25-75 basis points. On the inflation data, economic affairs secretary Subhash Chandra Garg in a tweet said: ""Both WPI and CPI inch up in July at 1.88 per cent and 2.4 per cent year on year. But still below the comfort level of 4 per cent."""

Homemakers rue that the rates are fluctuating from not just market to market, but from vendor to vendor. While Saraswati Singh of Piska More was lucky to purchase tomatoes for Rs 60 per kg at Naga Baba vegetable market on Tuesday, Babita Sharma of Upper Bazaar had had to pay an additional Rs 20 at the same market a day before.

Nisha said few people had the time and energy to hop markets for a reasonable price. ""We are suffering because the government hasn't implemented its order."" The vegetable market at Sector-II in Dhurwa seemed to be the most reasonable one. Rajni, a local resident, said she struck gold at Rs 60 per kg. Sudama Sahu, a farmer who sells vegetables on Kanke Road, admitted that the price of tomato hadn't stabilised. ""Vendors in posh areas like Ashoknagar and Morabadi are charging more,"" he said.

Picture by Ashwinee Pati Bhubaneswar, Aug. 2: The state government today resorted to market intervention by fixing the price limit for onion, which is now selling at Rs 25 a kg in retail market. Food supplies and consumer welfare minister Surya Narayan Patro today asked the traders to sell onion within Rs 17 per kg and warned stern action in case of hoarding the commodity. Patro said the department had been instructed to keep close watch over the price situation. Officials will purchase onion from the source and sell it at fair price shops of the government named as ""Maitree"" at reasonable price. In the first phase, it will be sold in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack. The department has been asked to keep a token of Re 1 profit margin per kg and sell it to make the retail price affordable for the consumers. However, consumers have been left high and dry as onion price is now selling in the city at Rs 25 per kg. The price of onion was Rs 15 per kg early last week. The rise in onion price following the soaring of tomato price has hit the consumers hard. Last week, tomato was selling at Rs 100 per kg in retail market. The state needs nearly five lakh tonnes of onion annually of which it produces nearly three to 3.5 lakh tonnes. Odisha produces onions mainly in Kalahandi, Balangir, Boudh and Angul districts as well as a few areas in the state's western districts. Odisha depends mainly on Maharshtra, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh for procurement of onions. Wholesalers said the recent floods in Nashik and crop loss in Andhra Pradesh had led to the price rise. ""The price of onion has increased at source points. The city is getting the normal supply of 10 to 15 trucks of onion on daily basis, but as the price has increased in the procurement areas, it has its impact in the state as well,"" said Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha secretary Sudhakar Panda. Traders apprehend that the current price would prevail till November. ""The winter crop from Nashik will reach the state in November. Besides, onions grown in various parts of the state will also enter the market in the winter and then the price will stabilise,"" said Panda. Farmers and traders said the state was suffering because of lack of adequate number of cold storages. The state had witnessed distress sale of onions in March. However, the state government had attributed distress sale to the over-production of the crop. ""However, the state government is yet to come up with adequate cold storages to ease the problem,"" said Abhiram Jena, a farmer. On the other hand, consumers are still bearing the brunt of price rise. ""The consumers have been badly hit by the skyrocketing prices of vegetables during rains. In this circumstances, price rise of onions will definitely put burden on us,"" said Nirakar Pradhan, a consumer."

The general secretary of Chantar Bazar Byabsayi Samiti, Pijush Das, said crops have been damaged across the state because of floods this year, pushing up the prices of vegetables, and it would take some time for circumstances to return to normal. He added that vegetables are being sold at rates equal to other markets in Chantar Bazar market and that vendors here do not fleece customers. Narrating the plight of lower middle class and poor people because of unethical practices adopted by a section of vendors, Abdul Bakkar, a retired grade IV government employee, said people are already facing extreme financial troubles because of the floods and the skyrocketing prices of vegetables/commodities added insult to injury. crisis of having vegetables in the district In summer, farmers of Karimganj district grow vegetables like okra, ridge gourd, bottle gourd, pointed gourd, bitter gourd, cucumber and others. In winter, vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower, turnip, carrot, capsicum and others are grown, he mentioned. Nearly 2,300 hectares of cultivable land, where vegetables are grown, have been damaged and more than 30,000 farmers have suffered losses because of floods this year. Sources said vegetables are being brought to Karimganj from Tripura, Shillong and Barpeta district, among others. However, since floods have affected those places too, the problem has been aggravated."

Thats how at Firdaus, Taj Krishna, the ongoing Gujarati Food Festival focuses on a variety of items from the state with tastes that are slightly sweet and flavoured with coconut and sesame seeds roasted ground and added to the dishes for that exquisite taste and aroma. The star hotel has partnered with Gujarat Tourism for the food promotion.We began with Hondvo, Methi Na Muthiya and Petis Corn Tikka. We liked the muthiya as the besan batter was nicely mixed with spices like Shepherds Purse, black salt and dry fenugreek leaves. Petis Corn Tikka was crispy and at the same time filling because of potatoes. To go with the starters, were an array of pickles such as green chilies pickle, mango pickle both in sweet and sour variety. In the main course, what we liked was Sev Tamatar: a preparation of tomato curry to which crispy crunchy sev was added. It tasted really well with Bajre Ki Roti and Thepla. We also tried Gujarati Kadhi with Bardoli Ki Khichdi. Gujarati Daal was a bit sweet like other dishes. Executive chef Nitin Mathur from Ahmedabad along with few other chefs curated the menu.For the desserts we recommend Moong Daal Ka Sheera and Mohanthhal: a halwa of yellow lentils with fried nuts. Mohanthhal was a sweet besan cake. The food festival is on till September 30. For dinner and lunch. Price: For one thali `2,300++"

Owing to the religious beliefs that hanging the vegetable during the festivities at ones doorsteps would ward off evil, ash gourd has become a cash machine for vendors.On a Normal day, a medium sized ash gourd fetches between `50 and `60, but vendors in the city markets are now making a quick buck selling the same at a whopping price of `200 to `250 for a medium sized piece due to high demand.A record arrival of 600 quintals of ash gourd was witnessed at the Bowenpally Market Yard here on Friday, which is almost 35 percent increase in the arrival registered the previous year. The production of this vegetable has increased considerably over the year and most of the stock arrive from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, said a senior agriculture marketing officer. However, even after an increase in the production and supply, the prices are on the rise this year. During Dasara last year we received close to 400 quintals of the vegetable and the price was also stable, the official said. While there is a hike in the retail price, farmers are paid only `6 per kg, which is not low and we are unable to get back our investment and labour, said K Koteshwar Rao, a gourd farmer from Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh.Rao on Thursday has supplied approximately 12 tons in a truck and the transportation costs him `14,000 from his place in Guntur.We have to come here or go to Chennai for selling our produce, as there is no scope in AP, he said, adding that he would not earn more than `5,000 in this trip after clearing all his debts. Only vendors are happy selling the gourds, while, both farmers and customers are not, Rao said.Vegetable prices skyrocketThe price of orange pumpkins has skyrocketed and on Thursday. About 683 quintals of pumpkin arrived at the Bowenpally market A kilogram of lemon was sold at `50 and tomatoes are priced at `14-`16 per kg and least quality of tomatoes are sold at Rs 2 - Rs 5 per kg"

Declaring Nargund of Gadag district the first open defecationfree (ODF) taluk in Karnataka on Tuesday, Naidu said over 2.45 lakh villages, 1,300 cities, 200 districts and five states have been declared ODF so far. All the villages along the banks of the Ganga have been declared ODF.He pointed out that over 5 crore toilets have been constructed in rural and urban areas in the last couple of years. There is still some distance to cover and the nation is committed to achieving open defecation-free status by October 2019, he added. Appreciating the performance of Karnataka on this front, the Vice-President said the household sanitation coverage in the state was only 30 per cent in 2014. Since then, the state has showed a remarkable progress in achieving over 72 per cent coverage today.The programme called Shouchalayakkaagi Samara (Crusade for Toilets) is being implemented across Karnataka as a peoples movement to stop open defecation. I compliment the Government of Karnataka on the same. I am sure Swachhta Hi Seva campaign will give a big thrust to Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan, he said. He said: Sanitation is more important than freedom. It is not the programme of either the Congress or the BJP, but of all people. Ram Rajya is incomplete without gram rajya. If villages are clean with good roads, doctors, tractors and actors will come. Otherwise, nobody will care. Dont worry about who has done it whether (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi or (Chief Minister) Siddaramaiah. It is the collective effort of all the GP members, officials and villagers.Naidu counts achievements of Karnataka* Teenager Lavanya had observed a three-day fast demanding toilets in each house in her village.

5a1483029855b76bf13e50f3,Just right for the day,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170926/jsp/opinion/story_174961.jsp,2017-09-26,,Telegraph,"The first thing you eat and drink in the morning is hugely important. The beverage and food provides fuel to a body that has, usually, not ingested anything for a good few hours. The quality and quantity, the taste and the 'rightness' of the first meal also go a long way towards shaping the start of your day and possibly the whole day itself. Furthermore, that first intake also fits in with a whole cluster of morning rituals that define who you are, ethnically, culturally, socially and class-wise. Or, horror of horrors, it doesn't actually gel with your usual habits and needs, creating its own misregistration between you and the day. Or, then again, the change of morning alimentation could provide a delicious challenge to an intrepid, unprejudiced and curious traveller. In my family of three, breakfast didn't actually exist. My parents would drink tea in the morning ( desi style, CTC, milk and sugar), while listening to the radio and reading the newspaper. Watching them, I used to think the crackling pages were actually their morning nashta, though they would also snack on some non-oily, non-spicy chevdo and some biscuits. The real meal would only come in the shape of an early lunch around 11 am. They could afford to stick to this very Gujju routine because my father ran his own business and my mother taught in a college where she never had early classes. On the other hand, I had to be given fodder before school and so strategies were developed, involving fruits, Bournvita, Ovaltine, Cadbury's Hot Chocolate and toast. My Madrasi friend who lived down the road came to school having quaffed lovely home-made idli, vada and dosai, which I thought was hugely unfair. At some point, eggs and I were introduced to each other by my mother, but outside our strictly vegetarian home. By and by, I discovered the illicit, taboo-joy of meat, which meant bacon or sausages along with the eggs. There was an epiphanic moment at age 15, on the first day of my first trip to the West. Travelling with my father on a strict budget, we found ourselves in a small hotel in Paris, confronting the all-important free breakfast that came with the price of the room. I sipped on magical hot chocolate, the likes of which I'd never tasted before, and simultaneously discovered this flaky, buttery, airy thing called a croissant and the French jams that go with it. At that age I knew a tiny bit about French painting and sculpture but this breakfast was the first time I encountered Gallic culture viscerally, haptically, through touch, smell and taste, and I was left flabbergasted - no wonder they painted so brilliantly after such a breakfast. Later, I came across the comment of the great film-maker, Jean Renoir: ""the quality of the day's shooting depends on the taste of the first cup of coffee in the morning."" By this time I'd graduated through my first encounter with the French petit djeuner and had had close dealings with all sorts of different breakfasts. There was the ghastly 'dead omelette' and banana at boarding school, variations on the same theme on the Indian railways, and, in contrast, the winter joys of stuffed paranthas, achar and dahi in roadside dhabas in north India. Filming in rural Bengal, you realized that 'breakfast' was as alien a concept here as in a middle-class Gujju household, often consisting of lal chaa accompanied by chirey or dry muri with green chillies and mustard oil. Travelling in Rajasthan, the tea came with dry rotis and pickles. South India was a heaven of different kinds of home-made dosai, upmas and utthapams. In Maharashtra, the sweet Gujju tea was tweaked just that little bit with spices that made it undrinkable for someone like me, but the pohey were a revelation. In various parts of the country, people with a little bit of money were also able to bombard their stomachs, first thing in the morning, with deep fried samosas, filluries and bhajiyas. Upon travelling, all sorts of categorizations would attack the mind that was just waking up. Breakfasts were cold or hot, heavy or light, centred around sweet tastes or savoury, expansively vegetarian, with a small non-veg presence or a truckload of meat with some tiny vegetable alibis on the side; there were summer breakfasts in hot countries and then summer ones in cold countries; winter breakfasts in the tropics and winter breakfasts with icicles hanging from the window. The one hugely unhealthy thing that became a constant for far too many of us was the coupling of a cup of tea or coffee with a cigarette; this would be first thing we would touch in the morning before space was created, biologically and mentally, for any solid food. At some point in a wintry Paris very different from the one I first visited, working on finishing the post-production of a film, I was introduced to the 'French working man's breakfast', which added a shot or two of cognac to the already formidable coffee and cigarette combination. In contrast to the gut-scouring sparseness of this lunacy were the examples of extreme morning excess. At a certain young age in America, it seemed to me and my pals a fun idea to put away a stack of pancakes, two kinds of egg, sausages, bacon and hash browns plus coffee and juice, all in one eating frenzy in some diner. Across the Atlantic, the 'Full English' was no less bruising: eggs, mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, all the aforementioned pig variations plus black pudding (for those who don't know: a delicious, dark biscuit of dried beef blood). As a change from this, one thankfully came across one standard Middle Eastern breakfast which consisted of olives, hummus, various other pastes, roasted and raw vegetables, salad and pita bread. Speaking of a 'Full English', I recently found myself watching a documentary titled Secrets of the Royal Kitchen, where one got to see two kinds of breakfast being made in the British royal kitchens. One was a 'normal' breakfast for Her Maj, elaborately eviscerated discs of brioche were lightly fried to make cages for poached eggs, which were then served with sausages. The other was a reconstruction of the wedding brekker made for the union of Charles and Diana in 1981, a meal eaten by the royals and a hundred and twenty of their closest friends. Starring on the menu were quenelles of brill with a lobster sauce and a breast of chicken stuffed with a lamb mousse, coated with brioche breadcrumbs, a minted cream sauce and samphire. Somewhere else in the film it says Queen Elizabeth never travels without crates and crates of her own English bottled water. No matter where in the world, the royal tea is always made with this same water. Watching this food porn I felt no twitch of lust for all the expensive, elaborate food that was being made and displayed. One of the things that put me off was when they said no garlic at all was allowed into the royal kitchens. As one grows older the realization hits the gut: eating some things in the morning makes you happy while eating other things, no matter how delicious, can destroy your day; if you eat healthily most of the time you can indulge occasionally; a croissant is a confection of genius but it is essentially a very small, fluffy lachha parantha that's been rolled up; muesli, fruits and raw nuts are not just a fad; garlic is one of the healthiest things you can eat raw in the morning. Another realization also lands, perhaps only partly true, but I'll venture it anyway: you can mess with a person's eating habits for lunch and dinner far more easily than you can with their breakfast. Just as the first language you learn, your mother tongue, is said to be stored in a different part of the brain from all the subsequent languages you pick up, I suspect the construction and taste of one's basic breakfast is also stored in a special place. This is perhaps why I find myself craving a sada dosa or a plate of luchi-alu while looking at artisanal brioche being carved into twee little medallions."
5a1484829855b76bf13e5217,Canned food got you in a pickle? Here's how you can opt for healthy ready-to-eat...,http://www.hindustantimes.com/fitness/canned-food-got-you-in-a-pickle-here-s-how-you-can-opt-for-healthy-ready-to-eat-meals/story-69mV8NyIUMsBFC4D0osBzK.html,2017-10-01,,Hindustan Times,"Theres nothing more satiating than relishing a traditional home cooked meal after a tiring day at work. But, thanks to our lifestyle, cooking after work feels like a tiresome chore. And, this is the reason why we are increasingly opting for ready-to-eat processed Indian meals, packaged chutneys and pickles. The appeal of these processed products is simple. You dont have to cook; they go straight from spoon to mouth. However, we conveniently ignore the fact that these processed foods come laden with preservatives that are extremely unhealthy and ecologically unsustainable. To combat the rise of packaged unsustainable Indian foods, many food enthusiasts are popularising homemade Indian sustainable products, which include pickles, condiments and ready-made meals. I love cooking traditional South Indian meals. Every time I used an age old recipe, I struggled with getting authentic masalas. The ready-made condiments available in the market lack authentic flavour and aroma. Thats when I decided to make my own masalas. I make gunpowder, sambar powder and tamarind rice mix at home. They became so popular among my friends that they prodded me to launch my own range of masalas. We use traditional recipes to make preservative free, fresh, natural, and healthy products, says 50-year-old Sudha Raj. She started her venture last year in August, under the name of Zing, along with her 58-year- old sister, Sushila Srinivasan. Sudha says its a myth that homemade masalas and condiments have a very short shelf life. The shelf life of these products can go up to one year, depending on the product. Her products start at Rs150.Preserving our rich culinary traditionApart from being healthy, sustainable food products help preserve our rich culinary tradition. Our recipes have been handed over through generations. I dont think you can enjoy authentic Indian food if you club processed product to your food. What we make at home is free of chemicals and added colours. Our raw papaya, tomato and garlic relish and pickles such as adrak ka achar and hari mirch ka achar are very popular . The starting price of one jar is Rs100,says 34-year- old chef Chandrashekar, who has been making homemade preservative-free pickles for 4 years now.Economic ChallengesMango chilli jam available at Rummy Kitchen .Despite various benefits that come with sustainable products, economic challenges are a barrier to making it a preferred choice for consumers as compared to packaged products. Organic, fresh ingredients are expensive to acquire. Competing with big brands that produce in bulk and sell at low cost, is difficult. Consumers also prefer buying off-the-shelf products. And convenience and pricing become the determining factor, says 45-year-old Inderpreet Nagpal, who started her food venture Rummy Kitchen, three years ago.Inderpreet makes organic pickles and jams. Her range includes chicken, surmai, pork, prawns, keema pickles and jams such as mutton chilli jam and bacon jam. The starting price for one jar is Rs200.Apart from the expensive ingredients, getting a license to market homemade products to grocery stores is also a challenge. You need to register and get a license to market your product. To get a license to sell, you need to show a turnover of at least Rs12 lakh minimum. This is why our products dont make it to grocery stores, says Sudha Raj.Aloo Goli available at Just 2 Eat.So, how does one deal with the economic challenge? 42-year-old Manmohan Singh, who started his venture Just 2 Eat, six months ago, believes that one can deal with economic hindrances by mass producing sustainable food items. We produce packaged Indian food without using preservatives. Through our NGO Singh Educational Welfare Association along with the help of KVIC (Khadi And Village Industries Commission), we impart culinary skills to children above the age of 16 years in rural places. The advantage of this is that we are able to produce mass quantities of sustainable Indian food. These kids acquire the necessary skills to start their own small venture in the near future. Also, it stops rural migration of the children to metropolitan cities, says Singh. His products start at Rs90 and include ready-to-eat dishes such as Aloo Gobhi, Rajma Chawal, and Chicken Biryani.Expert opinion on preservativesPreservatives contains chemicals such as formalin and sodium metaborate. They are high in sodium content. In the long run, they can harm our internal organs such as heart, liver and the kidneys. They also cause high blood pressure and obesity. Packaged products that have a very long shell life are risky, as they contain too many preservatives. Preservatives can make us feel lethargic and irritated. - Dr Mohsin Wali, cardiologist and former honorary physician to the President"

Picture by Ngangbam Indrakanta Singh Imphal, Sept. 21: The 24-hour strike imposed across the state by Co-ordination Committee (CorCom), a conglomeration of several outfits of Manipur and Manipur Naga Revolutionary Front (MNRF), today hit normal life. The strike was called to protest the merger of Manipur with the Indian Union in 1949 on this day. The outfits alleged that Maharaj Bodhachandra Singh, the then king of Manipur, was forced to sign the merger agreement with the government of India and the state formally became a part of India on October 15 the same year. The Coalition for Indigenous Rights Campaign (Circa) also recalled the Manipur merger agreement and organised the National Repentance Day at Sana Konung (royal temple), here. Shops, business establishments and educational institutions were shut as a result of the strike. The roads wore a deserted look. Work in the government offices almost came to a standstill. However, a few women vendors at Khwairambandh Bazar continued their business as usual on the roadside. Basic services like medical and fire services were exempt from the purview of the strike. A woman vegetable vendor at the market here said, ""Whenever there is a bandh, we suffer a lot. All my rice, beans and tomatoes could not be sold today and tomorrow nobody will buy them as they will be almost rotten. Any form of protest should not affect poor people like us."" On the occasion of the repentance day function, Angom Ningthou, an executive member of Utra Sanglen, said Manipur had various issues which remain unresolved. ""We realised that the issues can be solved only when Manipur regains pre-merger status. We recall that this day Maharaj Bodhachandra was forced to sign the merger agreement. We take it as the most unfortunate day among those historic events from 1947 to 1949,"" he said. Paosing Golmei, a co-convener of Circa, said, ""Although the people of the state are aware that Manipur was a sovereign state, they seem to have completely forgotten that it was forcibly merged with India. Most people do not take it seriously. The original culture and traditions of the state became weak due to the intervention of external forces."" Manipur's ""national flag"", which bore the emblem of lord Pakhangba of the Meiteis, was flown half-mast at the event. Two-minutes' silence was also observed. The repentance day event was attended by various civil organisations and members of students' groups."

The driver was wounded and the truck stopped, the ministry said in a statement.A Western security source told AFP that each 20-litre drum contained ammonium nitrate, which is also used to make fertilizer. The containers were connected by yellow electric cables, photographs showed.The only thing missing was the device to detonate the explosives, he said.Security in the Afghan capital has been ramped up since May 31 when a massive truck bomb ripped through the citys diplomatic quarter, killing about 150 and wounding around 400 people, mostly civilians.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack -- the deadliest in the city since 2001 -- that Western officials say was caused by more than 1,500 kg of explosives packed in a sewage truck.The government has blamed the Taliban-allied Haqqani Network for the bombing. Taliban militants rarely claim responsibility for attacks that kill large numbers of civilians.Following outrage over the attack authorities increased the number of police checkpoints in the diplomatic zone and installed special barriers to prevent trucks from entering the centre of the city.Scanners to check lorries wanting access to the area where embassies and international organisations are located were also being used.In August Afghan intelligence seized a truck in Kabul carrying more than 16 tonnes of explosives hidden in boxes marked as poultry feed.But despite the enhanced security measures insurgents have continued to carry out carnage in the capital.In the most recent major attack a suicide bomber disguised as a shepherd blew himself up near a Shiite mosque in Kabul last month killing six people.Ordinary Afghans have borne the brunt of the 16-year insurgency, with more than 26,500 civilians killed and nearly 49,000 wounded as a result of armed conflict since January 2009, according to UN figures.Suicide and militant attacks have been particularly deadly. Between January and September 1,584 civilians were killed and wounded in such incidents, the UN says, accounting for 20 percent of casualties over the nine-month period."

He was the first to find the location and altitude of Lhasa .He mapped the course of Tsangpo river and the trade route between Nepal and Tibet.The Doodle, designed by Hari and Deepti Panicker, portrays Rawat as he might have looked on his travels  solitary and courageous, looking back over the distances he had walked, rosary beads in hand, and staff by his side, reads Googles description of the explorer.Rawat, who was recruited by the British for mapping, used to disguise as a Tibetan monk and walk as far as Kathmandu in Nepam, Lhasa in Tibet and Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh. He concealed instruments like a compass in his prayer wheel and hid his travel records as prayers. His pace during his travels remained uniform and he measures his steps using a rosary.Rawat was also recruited by German geographers, the Schlagintweit brothers, in 1855, according to an NDTV report.He was awarded the Patrons Medal in 1877 by the Royal Geographical Society for his explorations. British Colonel Henry Yule advocated for awarding Rawat and spoke about him during the medal presentation ceremony. He said the explorer is not a topographical automaton, or merely one of a great multitude of native employees with an average qualification. His observations have added a larger amount of important knowledge to the map of Asia then those of any other living man, a Frontline article said.A book on Rawat titled Asia Ki Peeth Par (On the Back of Asia) was published in 2006, illuminating the writings and life of the 19th century Indian explorer.Rawat died of a heart attack while visiting Jagir, a village gifted to him by the British, in 1895.Google marks significant events and honours the achievements of people from different walks of life.

The National Institute of Plant Health Management (NIPHM), a body under the Union agriculture ministry, is conducting the three-year study in collaboration with Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana. The study began in October last year.Use of proper techniques, giving the correct amount of dose at an appropriate time and increased awareness among farming community has led to the positive results.The first-year results of the study are encouraging. Things are not as bad as we think. We couldnt find as much pesticide residue as has been publicised. In none of the tomato samples, did we detect pesticides above the prescribed MRL (Maximum Residue Limit), said Dr G Jayalakshmi, director NIPHM, adding that pesticide residues couldnt be detected from samples taken from organic and Integrated Pest Management (IPM) fields. IPM is a method by which soil is worked on to make it better prepared for pest management.Some fruit samples drawn from conventional farmers fields showed the presence of residues of mancozeb, profenophos and triazophos, but these were also below the MRL levels and thus safe, she added.The methodology of the studyTwo crops were studied in both kharif and rabi seasons. To distinguish between fields, samples were also taken from organic and conventional fields. Specifically, samples were collected from one-acre fields in Swal village in Sultanpur Lodhi, Kapurthala. The organic field selected was from Dvyagram village, Nurmahal, in Jalandhar. For conventional fields, 10 villages in Kapurthala were chosen to take samples.Pesticide consumption has dropped: PAU studyAs if to support this theory, a PAU study found that the consumption of insecticides in Punjab has declined from 3,800 metric tonnes in 2001-02 to 2,344 metric tonnes in 2016-17, a drop of around 40%. Another PAU study on status of pesticide residues in Punjab done on 5,224 food crops from 2011 to 2017 also shows that almost 92% of crops were free of pesticides. This signals a significant trend reversal as a similar study on 1,507 crops done three decades ago from 1981 to 1990 showed only 22% within the safe limit.

Youre going to get some inside information now, so listen close. Did you know that even with a very superficial understanding of how press previews work, you could make a fairly accurate prediction about how a movie will ultimately be received?You did? Then feel free to skip ahead. The rest of you, gather round.Allow me to illustrate with three examples, all from 2017: Edgar Wrights Baby Driver, the upcoming Thor: Ragnarok, and the reason behind this blatant procrastination, Geostorm.A large part of Baby Drivers marketing highlighted its (then) phenomenal 100% Rotten Tomatoes score. Sony premiered the film at the South by Southwest Festival, more than three months before its worldwide release. During the weeks leading up to its release, they encouraged everyone whod seen it to talk about it online, and no embargoes were enforced on critics reviews. So when the time finally came for the world to watch what Wright had made, the buzz was firmly in place.Its been a similar story for Thor  and, you will notice, most Marvel films  which held its first press screenings two whole weeks before release day. Its currently the highest-rated MCU movie ever, with a 99% score on Rotten Tomatoes. That number will go down for sure, but the fact that it has become a talking point illustrates what Im getting at.Geostorm, meanwhile  lets just get this over with  was not screened for the press in advance. The first batch of professional reviews appeared online a day after its release. If you take a look at its RT page, youd see only a handful of them - a suspiciously small number - all presumably written by journalists whod paid to see it.The point being, despite what they tell you in trailers and advertisements, studios usually know exactly what they have on their hands. And in the case of Geostorm, the latest in our scheduled biannual abusive appointment with Gerard Butler, Warner Bros saw a cut back in 2015, decided it wasnt up to the mark, had the director unceremoniously booted off the project, spent millions on reshoots, and still delivered one of the worst movies of the year.Its a personal rule to avoid reading/watching opinions about a film before having seen it myself, but its so difficult to resist a signature Mark Kermode rant. I think its the stupidest film I have ever seen, said the Observer critic, slouched on his chair with an appearance of a man forced to reconsider everything hes believed in.And thats the overall emotion Geostorm leaves you with  oddly introspective. Not only does it make you question your life  why do you love movies at all, why did you waste precious moments of your youth yelling This is Sparta at your friends, whatll it take to get Gerard Butler to stop  but it also makes you question things you genuinely adore.For example, nothing in this movie is as far fetched as your average Tintin comic  but only one of them is a timeless masterpiece. And just the fact that you had this thought at all is a testament to the soul-sucking evilness of this movie.Watching it  or more accurately, enduring it, and surviving it  will make you want to undergo an exorcism, or a lobotomy. Itll leave you wondering if being frozen alive, or being pelted in the face with football-sized hail, or being crushed under an airliner dropping out of the sky  all honest-to-god things that happen in this movie  would be such a bad idea after all.Without wasting much time  because, lets be honest, most people have gone already; they saw that rating  heres taking a stab at the insane plot: After a series of calamitous events caused by climate change, a group of international scientists lead by Jake Lawson (Butler), builds a system of satellites called Dutch Boy designed to control weather disruptions. Soon, however, Dutch Boy is hacked into, hijacked, and weaponised. Temperatures plunge in Rio, the heavens burst open in Hong Kong, and the oceans rise in New Orleans  and this is just the beginning, Jake prophecies. Its all leading up to an apocalyptic event, a Geostorm. Cue the dramatic music and cheesy sound effects.Its all utterly ridiculous, of course. But that doesnt necessarily have to spell disaster, pun not intended. 2012, The Day After Tomorrow, and Armageddon were each borne out of central ideas that were equally, if not more, outlandish as anything in Geostorm  but theyre all a blast. Its how the filmmakers choose to treat these ideas is what really matters  the tone they take, the pacing of it, how the actors pitch their performances, and whether or not we care about the characters.And Geostorm, for close to two agonising hours, routinely makes the wrong choices. Its dull, too earnest for its own good, and like Gerard Butlers 2016 gem Gods of Egypt, completely unaware of its own silliness. For Gods sake, its a movie in which a Scotsman, an Englishman and an Australian play Americans, an Irishman plays an Englishman, an Egyptian plays a Frenchman, and an American plays an Indian.Come.

While the total area under horticulture crops in the block is 2,000 to 2,200 hectares, 70 per cent of the land is under tomato cultivation.Wilt disease in the tomato crops was first reported from Sorda gram panchayat (GP) a fortnight back and now the disease is spreading to newer areas. Nuagaon Assistant Horticulture Officer (AHO), Soumya Pathak, and Assistant Agriculture Officer (AAO), P Mandal, visited some of the affected areas and confirmed the spread of the disease.Pathak said from symptoms in the affected plants, it appeared to be viral wilt disease and 25 to 30 per cent of the late kharif crop was affected. He said during inquiry, farmers admitted to repeating tomato cultivation on the same piece of land which increases chances of virus contamination and fungus attacks. He said tomato crops requires less labour with high returns, luring farmers to opt for it.An affected farmer, Nath Samad of Golatoli hamlet under Sorda, said he had invested about `1.25 lakh on growing tomatoes over three acres of land but a majority of the standing crops has been damaged by the wilt disease. Farmers such as Ganju Oram of Banki village in Chitapedi GP, Anil Ekka of Barilepta GP and Soma Lakra of Sorda GP have similar stories to tell.Pathak said they have asked the affected tomato farmers to immediately remove the plants which are affected by the disease to save healthy plants and avoid repeating planting the crop on the same piece of land. He said from an acre, farmers get 50 to 60 quintals of indigenous tomato varieties, while the yield is 250 to 300 quintals per acre for hybrid tomato crops.Panposh Assistant Horticulture Director (ADH) S P Nayak said spraying of pesticide was taken up by some farmers, but it did not work. It is impossible to contain the spread of the disease with any form of treatment, including pesticide application and the only viable option is to remove affected plants, he said, adding that a study would be conducted soon to assess the total crop damage.Nuagaon caters to bulk tomato requirement of Rourkela city and at present, the vegetable is priced at about Rs 50 per kg. Last year too, the tomato farmers of Nuagaon had faced loss in the shape of distress sale due to bumper crop."

Locals claim that the prices have gone beyond the budget of commoners as no vegetable is available at a rate below `60 per kg. The highest price is of tomatoes, which are selling at `80 per kg in Baripada town and nearby haats. The situation is no better at Rairangpur, Karanjia and Udala sub-divisions . Prices of locally-grown vegetables have also increased, locals said.The traders have linked the price rise to poor supply of vegetables from other States due to erratic rainfall. Contradicting traders, sources, however, claimed that local businessmen have created an artificial shortage of vegetables and managed to hike the prices, taking advantage of the huge demand for vegetables in the holy month. Meanwhile, commoners have apparently cut down their vegetable consumption.The price rise of vegetables has come as a major shock for my family, said Sumati Singh, a housewife. Almost all the vegetables were priced between `30 and `40 per kg three months back. Now, the prices of most of the vegetables have been doubled. Nowadays, a small family has to spend at least `500 to `600 for vegetables for an entire week. Earlier, we used to spend only `300 to `400 for a weeks consumption, said Manoj Sethi, a resident of Purunahatsahi Ward No. 6.At least 20 to 30 per cent vegetables demand is usually fulfilled by vegetable growers of Khuntapal, Kuliona and Pratapur from Barasahi area. The rest is met by supplies from other States. Now, the vegetable sellers of Gopiballhavpur in the neighbouring State of West Bengal and Tata in Jharkhand have been sending supplies to Baripada market and the three sub-divisions of the district, said a vegetable wholesaler.Locals, however, alleged that unscrupulous traders have hiked the prices in the absence of a proper market regulation mechanism.

Now, I feel compelled to include non-vegetarian food in the menu to retain my customers.According to local traders, the vegetable market here depends on neighbouring States such as West Bengal, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh. Due to hike in prices of vegetables there, the market here has been affected, they said.The demand for vegetables has increased in the wake of marriage season and this is another reason for the price hike, said Valu Khanaa, a vegetable vendor. Sources in the Regulated Market Committee said vegetables worth Rs 7 lakh are sold in Bhadrak town daily. The sales double during marriage season.Sources said vegetable farming is being hardly given any importance in the district with over 95 per cent of vegetables being imported from other States.

Today, he is reaping rich dividends from it. Apart from paddy cultivation, the father and son duo grows vegetable as well as fruits with help of two deep bore wells and are also into pisciculture.Prior to joining of Bismaya, Laxminarayan was cultivating paddy in only over five acres of land till 1999. He started vegetable farming in 2000 and cultivated pointed gourd (potal) in over half an acre of land and even managed to earn a profit of `20,000 in the first year. Subsequently, he ventured into cultivation of pumpkin, tomato as well as brinjal and expanded vegetable farming to over one and a half acres of land. Currently, the father-son duo earns a profit of about `50,000 per annum from vegetables only.Later, on being informed that pisciculture offers good returns, Laxminarayan dug up a tank in one acre of land with subsidised loan amounting to `90,000 from the Fisheries department. He spent `1.27 lakh to start pisciculture and released fish spawns of Rohu, Common Carp and Catla into the tank.Now, the father and son harvest around eight quintal of fish annually and earn a profit of about `50,000 per annum.After making up his mind to join his father, Bismaya decided to devote his entire time to farming activities and began banana cultivation in over one acre of land with support from National Horticulture Mission.Bismaya said they spent about `1.20 lakh to start banana cultivation with help of drip irrigation. In the first year of harvesting, they managed to recover the total expenditure. The saplings were provided free of cost by the Horticulture department along with subsidy on drip irrigation, he said.In the second year, the father-son duo earned a profit of `1 lakh after incurring an expenditure of `20,000. They have already earned a profit of more than `50,000 during the current year and the financial gain will cross `1 lakh, he said.Altogether, they earned a profit of about `2.5 lakh per annum, including profit of `50,000 from paddy cultivated over 10 acres as sharecroppers besides their own 3.5 acres of land.Buoyed by the profit from banana, Bismaya has planned to expand its cultivation to one and a half acres of more land from the next kharif season besides potal in over another half an acre.Bismaya said they face no problem in selling their produce as traders come to the village to procure it. I am happy after taking up farming as a profession and this decision of mine has proved to be a success, he added."

(Above): Workers in the final stages of pack gherkins with acid preservatives and vinegar in Ranebennuru in Haveri district, Karnataka. (Below) The gherkin is a demanding crop; even a one-day delay in picking the fruit makes it unviable. A farm hand in Ranebennuru, Haveri district.Sudhakara JainManzoor, a farmer barely in his 20s, picks up a small prickly fruit. He scrapes at its rough green skin, which is covered in hair. I know for sure you cant eat this, he says. He speaks of a large company, whose local agents contacted him with seeds, contracts and promises earlier this year. It is actually medicine, he adds, with some confidence. When he puts it down, he washes his hands thoroughly, and uses a stone to exfoliate the fingers. Pesticide, he says, corrodes the skin, turning it rough and whitish.Neat rows of strings and poles divide his one acre farm into grids. Water marks the channel in the middle, and the creepers clinging desperately to strings are beginning to wilt with disease.Manzoor is astonished to hear that people in other parts of the world eat the medicine that he grows. No one has told him that in the West, pickled gherkin is a condiment, as common on dining tables as pepper. Confounded, he calls his neighbours, who have been growing gherkins in their village Thimmapura in Haveri district, close to the River Tungabhadra in Central Karnataka. They laugh. No, it cannot be. When our children come here, we have to keep an eye on them. If they eat it, they will fall sick. It fills the stomach with gas, says Rajappa, another young farmer who has been growing gherkins for the past five years.The recent rains have transformed the undulating plains into a quilt of green. In these chequered fields sliced up only by roads and irrigation canals, rice, maize, sugarcane and millets have been the traditional crops. Its only over the past decade that the gherkins have slowly established a foothold.But the bad news is that this seasons crop has been washed out by unseasonal rains. The three gherkin crops in a year are typically grown from April to June, August to October, and December to February.Discussing gherkins with farmers inevitably leads to narratives of agrarian distress, migrations, and failed bore wells. Amid the vinegar flavours of gherkin processing centres in Karnakatas agro-processing zones spread across eight districts, managers and exporters list out their concerns. These range from the Goods and Service Tax, which shrinks their working capital, to the international outrage over Russian military aggression, to even the weather in Vietnam. A bumper crop in that country could affect the fortunes of the crop back home in India, and thus the lives of Manzoor and Rajappa.A crop like no otherWith little domestic demand, the foreign crop is like no other in the State, and perhaps in the country. Seeds sealed in neat packets are brought in all the way from Europe. Export companies engage farmers through contracts, and it is in the unpredictable agrarian environs of Karnataka that the alien fruit is birthed.The fruit, however, undergoes a series of chemical treatments before being shipped thousands of miles again, with its final destination ranging from the restaurants of Madrid to the supermarkets of Manhattan.In the 1990s, as information technology (IT) and the outsourcing boom transformed Bengaluru, a few hundred kilometres away, exporters found in the relative warmth of districts such as Kolar and Bagepalli the perfect conditions for the cultivation of gherkins. Just like the IT boom, this one, too, was founded on cheap labour.For more than a decade, this sector saw on average an annual growth rate of 20%. Export companies popped up like mushrooms in food parks and SEZs. While banks announced special loans, agriculture policies dangled special incentives, and gherkin contract farming spread across the State. The gherkin revolution has turned many impoverished farmers into lakhpathis, stated a 2006 report by the Institute for Social and Economic Change (ISEC) in 2006.By 2014, over 1.31 lakh farmers in southern India were engaged in gherkin cultivation. The sectors exports touched Rs. 1,200 crore, an impressive feat considering that a decade ago, exports were barely worth Rs. 180 crore.When it was dropped into the State two decades ago, the fruit did not have a local name. Now it goes by the odd term medicine cucumber. Most say that it is a corruption of the Kannada word,midi, meaning small. Farmers in areas where gherkins are just making an entry into the landscape think that the name is on account of it being made into medicine (some believe it cures piles), or, perhaps, because the fruit leaves a bitter aftertaste, like a tablet.Karnataka, where gherkin cultivation covers 20 out of the 30 districts, accounts for more than 60% of Indias production, with the neighbouring States of Andhra Pradesh, Maharasthra and Tamil Nadu chipping in.Similar to the dynamics in the IT sector, where a policy announcement on the other side of the world tends to echo through the air-conditioned corridors of Bengaluru, the gherkin industry is also highly vulnerable to the headwinds of global events.The Russia problemIn 2014, parts of central Karnataka saw copious monsoon rains even as large parts of the State battled drought. The perfect conditions yielded a bumper crop. But just a few months before the monsoons arrived, something unexpected happened: Russian soldiers took over the courthouses and government buildings of Crimea.The Russian annexation of Crimea had begun. Despite international outrage, a referendum was conducted. Eventually, a pro-Russia government was installed to govern the peninsula where no gherkins are grown.As Russia faced sanctions from Europe and America, suddenly, Indias largest importer of gherkins found itself unable to afford the fruit. Thousands of miles away, in nondescript villages of Karnataka where news from the outside world is hard to come by, company agents were suddenly obsessed with the Russia crisis.A conversation in Hemodre, a village in drought-prone Sira taluk near the Andhra Pradesh border, triggers an impromptu gathering of curious farmers. Beeresh, 30, the local agent, is called in to explain the dynamics of gherkin cultivation in the village.Beereshs job is to talk to farmers, perhaps even give loans (sometimes from his own pocket), so that they shift to gherkin cultivation. He has to ensure enough produce to meet the targets, which are decided by the companies based on the export orders they have received. The credit he gives to the farmers is later deducted from the payments made for the gherkin produce.I used to contract 250 farmers. But due to the Russia problem and other issues, we were asked to cut down on acreage as demand dipped. Now there are 150 farmers, but they dont do it regularly enough, he says. With the cut in supply, his commissions have dropped. He is now in a debt of more than Rs. 2 lakh, which he hopes to pay off when the market stabilises.About 200 km away, in a recently refurbished factory that sticks out incongruously in the maize and sugarcane fields of southern Ballari district, the air smells of the acid preservatives in which gherkins are stored.Srinivas R., the factory manager, explains what happened when Crimea was annexed. In 2014-15, the factory handled 14,000 tonnes. We prepared for a bumper crop, and suddenly the orders dipped. The rouble had crashed, from 38 to 83 roubles to a dollar. The Russians were no longer able to buy gherkins in bulk from here. We had tonnes of gherkins with no buyers, he says. Within a year, the acreage sown in the area reduced by 40%.The setback reverberated through company balance sheets. Exports to Russia came down from Rs. 234 crore in 2014-15 to just Rs. 90 crore in 2016-17. Russia remains the key, for it is the only importing country that takes lower-grade gherkins which are often rejected by European buyers.The crisis devastated the industry. At least five companies with significant investments  some owned by hotel, telecom and steel tycoons  have folded up. These are difficult times, compounded by international and domestic problems, says Mune Gowda, who heads Exotic Agro Pvt. Ltd., and is the Treasurer of the Indian Gherkin Exporter's Association. Even the U.S. has started importing from Mexico, while Vietnam is catching up in gherkin production, he says. In the past three years, a quarter of the gherkin farmers have stopped production for various reasons, estimates the association. Production has dipped by over 70,000 metric tonnes. Making up for the loss of the Russian market by tapping the European one proved difficult as the latter is choosy and has strict compliance norms and certification requirements.The foreignerDomestically, cultivating gherkins comes with its own problems. Unpredictable weather takes a toll on the crop. The gherkin itself is a demanding crop that takes its pound of flesh from the land on which it is sown. It acts like a foreigner who lives here, says Ranganath at Hemodre village. He is relatively less enamoured of the cucumber. He is not taken in by the promise of high yields. If the wind changes direction for an hour, it falls sick, he says.Gherkins need constant care, which isnt easy given the harsh realities of farming in India: monsoons are erratic and prone to failure; rural distress has sparked large-scale migrations and reduction in the availability of labour; tropical diseases sweep across large tracts; and groundwater reserves are dwindling. This constant battle has made the farmers christen the fruitkiri kiritarakari(irritating vegetable) andsoutekaye savasa(problematic cucumber).A little more than a month after the seeds are sown, gherkins pop out of the base of the flower, yielding fruits incessantly for the next two months.It is here that the trouble begins. If it is not picked within a few hours of flowering, it grows exponentially in size, and for the farmers, the bigger it is, the smaller their returns. The gherkins are graded according to their size and there are five grades in all. The smallest gherkins (160 of them can fit in a crate) could fetch Rs. 32 per kilo. The biggest (less than 30 in a crate) fetch just Rs. 2. If transportation of the plucked gherkins is delayed, up to one-third of the produce could be lost.We need 15 labourers a day just to pick the fruit. Most of the youth have gone to Bengaluru or Hyderabad for jobs. If we delay the picking by one day, the gherkin grows and becomes unviable for us, said 41-year-old Siddarameshwara in the remote Udramappanahalli village of Sira taluk. His crop this year has been ravaged by mildew, which sets upon gherkins when it rains.Its because of these reasons that despite his success with the crop in the past 10 years, he has confined gherkins to just 0.5 acres of his 12-acre farm. As white, stringy fungus envelops the gherkin, he hopes that the winter crop can compensate for his loss. However, in the slight chill of the winter lurks the melon fly which, farmers say, no quantity of pesticide can effectively contain.More disconcertingly, the crop guzzles water. If the field is not irrigated daily, gherkins become shrivelled and bent, unsuitable for export. For the 50 days or so that it flowers, farmers have to draw water from their borewells. If maize needs water thrice in two weeks, the gherkin needs it every day. Maize is grown twice a year; gherkins thrice a year. For all the three seasons to yield sizeable profits, it needs more than 150 days of irrigation.The guru of gherkinsEight years ago, it was the sight of a group of Spaniards inspecting gherkins in Bagepalli, just 100 km from Bengaluru close to the Andhra Pradesh border, that enthralled villagers. Taking them around the clusters of gherkin villages was B. Srinivas, whose company acted as a conduit for the bigger companies and farmers. The Spaniards had told the gherkin growers that the produce here was the best they had seen.Having taken to the gherkin sector in 1998, it was he and a small band of agents who persuaded farmers to try this new crop. Agents and company facilitators propped up. Bollywood-style films on gherkin management were shown to farmers to attract them to the crop. Gherkins, it was believed, could lift the region out of poverty.Srinivas remembers the gherkin rush. Farmers would line up for seeds. We could even do large swathes of 30 acres in each village. Things were easy back then.Over 1,000 acres of gherkins  a limit constrained only by the volume of the companies export orders  were sown in 2006-07. Money flowed as advances to farmers, agents kept a steep commission from the output, and for farmers, gherkins did translate into money.Then the inevitable happened. By the late 2000s, the rains started failing, and one by one, the borewells went dry. Groundwater dipped in places from 400 feet to more than 1,200 feet. In places where the borewells ran through the summer, they now stopped two months before the rains, and later, didnt function even in the winter. Gherkins, with their immediate need for water, were the first to be affected.By 2011, the number of red farmers  those with debts  rose dramatically, and the agents had to look farther for suitable land, with some going as far as Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh. It just didnt work out. We would get half an acre in one village and a couple of acres elsewhere far away. The debts kept rising. I had to get out, Srinivas says.In the hustle of the Bagepalli market, the man who many farmers and agents say was the guru of gherkins in the region now runs an agro-business focussing only on traditional vegetables and maize seeds. Just three agents operate now, and struggle to cumulatively cover 50 acres.Cycles of debtDrought and international price fluctuations have left behind a cycle of debt  unpaid loans for field agents and gherkin farmers, who, in turn, have to pledge a greater share of future gherkin production.In the past decade, the prices of the seeds, all imported, went up from 6 paise to 68 paise per seed. If tomato seeds cost Rs. 700 for 10,000, the cost for gherkins is up to Rs. 10,000. The returns, however, havent kept up. In the same period, the price of premium gherkins has gone up from Rs. 8 to Rs. 32 per kg.In some areas, agents have racked up debts of more than Rs. 50 lakh. Agents like Gangappa in Bagepalli who claims to have nearly Rs. 70 lakh in debt from farmers in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, have pinned their hopes on the recent rains that have filled up tanks. They hope that these farmers can repay the debt by cultivating gherkins again.The rains have indeed given life to the dry lands of Bagepalli, Sira and central Karnataka, which glimmer now in various shades of green. There is slight optimism in the corporate offices of exporters too: a steady year can blunt Indias reputation as an uncertain producer that frequently misses shipment dates. But is it possible that, somehow, the U.S. and Russia would normalise relations and bring Indian gherkins back on Russian tables?Well, the fruit is fickle and vulnerable, and uncertainties loom, much like the dark vestigial monsoon clouds that threaten to wash out this seasons crop.I used to contract 250 farmers. But due to the Russia problem and other issues, we were asked to cut down on acreage as demand dipped. Now there are 150 farmers, but they dont do it regularly enough.BeereshA local agentEven the U.S. has started importing from Mexico, while Vietnam is catching up in gherkin production.Mune GowdaHead, Exotic Agro Pvt.

Even those not knowing the language are sure that I am singing from my heart, he explains settling down for a quick lunch at The Parks Fire restaurant. When I sing in other languages, I do it phonetically but am unable to put my soul behind it. This gets translated to the audience as they know kuch toh fake kar raha hai, he quips.After a quick look at the menu, Raghu asks for Caesar salad with lots of lettuce, kothamalli pestro, baby mozzarella and cherry tomatoes while agreeing to try Andhra quinoa and beetroot, suggested by the staff. Back to the point, he observes, Before singing, I always explain the lyrics. The language barrier is only for the first few minutes then it takes a back seat as audience feel assured with our passionate singing. The other day I sang for 150 people with just my guitar and other accompaniments. Yet, I made people sing Kannada songs.He maintains lyrics are the prime reason for his bands success in India and abroad as the songs have philosophical and positive messages. I dont do it deliberately as they are already embedded in the poems on which I compose music. He explains with examples. In Gudugudiya Sedi Nodo, poet Santa Shishunala Sharif asks how does one feel after smoking hookah in which materialistic pursuits are burnt in a chillum called faith. Youngsters realising the poems gravity remark, That is really deep. Similarly, the song Lokada Kaalaji Maaduthinanthi, by the same poet says, dont worry and be happy in life. Relatable, the audience connect to it. He feels even if two out of 10 are drawn to know about these poets and their writings, he feels happy. Today, as soon as we release a new song, my hardcore fans immediately want to know the meaning.Colourful attireThe colourful and printed lungis and dhotis of band members also make Raghu Dixit Project stand out. It is a take off from what I learnt in Bharatanatyam. Its aharya abhinaya relates to costumes and make-up. I incorporated these dresses to highlight who we are. I wear bells on my feet as it is rhythmic. Moreover, the dress gives us a unique look which is unlike other groups who perform in jeans and T shirts.The Caesar salad is laid out. It is fresh and light, he remarks. Not very fussy about food, he prefers Southern cuisines like Manglorean and Chettinad. I like rasam, sambar, idli, dosa, bisi bele bath, yengai and puliyodharai. In fact, curd rice can carry me anywhere in the world. What about Andhra food? As it is spicy, I dont eat it regularly but do so when suffering from severe cold. Believe me, one meal and it simply vanishes, he jests.Describing himself a decent cook, the singer reveals he learnt the art during his bachelor days. I would call up my mother in Mysore and ask for recipes and directions. Hit and trial and pots of luck made me learn this art which though similar to singing is much tougher. Elucidating, he explains: Both need ones heart and soul and they have to be done for joy and not for commercial gains. The two help in building lasting human relationships. On our tours, fans invite us to share lunch and dinner with them. Once desperate to have rasam in New York, I posted a request on the Facebook. I instantly received 30 invitations!Surprisingly, Raghu doesnt follow a strict diet. I eat everything vegetarian, including street food, like gol gappe, chaat, dahi bhalle, vada pav and misil pav. Perceiving my surprise, he explains, The throat should get used to everything to make it immune to ill-effects. Now he is speaking like a microbiologist. For the uninitiated, Raghu is a post graduate in Microbiology and worked for years in Belgium before moving to singing. Trying the Andhra quinoa and beetroot, he reveals, I learned Bharatanatyam for 18 years and once wanted to be a professional dancer. It was a challenge by a friend to do something macho like singing and playing guitar instead of dancing that made me turn to music. I learnt to sing 500 Miles Away From Home with a guitar in two weeks flat much to the friends surprise. Then I realised what a beautiful thing it is to play an instrument and sing. I became aware I had a voice and it is nice to sing. Felt like breaking barriers and do whatever I wanted to.Appetising journeyStill stage performances, cutting albums and composing for films like Chef , was a distant dream. Working in Belgium, Raghus landlord asked him to lend his recordings. I gave him a CD of songs I had written and sung in India which he sent to Radio 21 . It was well received and I was flooded by calls and mails asking for more . That set me thinking. If I could impress people who did not understand a word of what I am singing, then things could be better. Ten days later he quit and returned to India. I had been collaborating with my friend Bhaskar and had no band. So I quickly put together one. Named Antragani, we played in front of an audience of 40000. What an experience! relates Raghu.The group was later disbanded and he formed Raghu Dixit Project which cut albums, Raghu Dixit Project and Jag Changa. The project is a novel initiative as it is an open house for people to join to collaborate and continue till they wish to. It is a fluid arrangement and outfit and is working well, he reveals.With filmmakers opting for independent musicians to score for movies, Raghu got his chance. Besides Kannada and Tamil, he composed music for Mujhse Fraaandship Karoge and Bewakoofiyaan . His latest is Saif Ali Khan-starrer Chef for which he composed and also sang songs with Shugal Laga Le becoming quite popular. Initially, director Raja Menon asked me to compose one song which I disagreed as I wanted to compose the entire score. He gave me the script and I produced scratches which he liked immensely. Describing composing for movies challenging, Raghu says, Film music is bound by its storyline, characters and situations unlike independent music. The upshot is you can reach a wider audience. The group also appeared in the film. Calling it fun, he says, Raja asked us to fly to Mumbai to perform Shugal Laga Le. Saif was absolutely cool during shooting and the scenes and song were shot much to Rajas satisfaction.One assumes Chefs popular appeal will ensure more filmy collaborations. Live performances are and will be my first preference, he sums up before rushing for rehearsals."

But the country still has some distance to cover in terms of exports as post-harvest wastage of produce in India is high.In 2015, the Modi government started project CHAMAN  acronym for Coordinated Horticulture Assessment and Management using geo-informatics  to prepare a comprehensive horticultural plan. Using remote sensing technology to study soil conditions, land use, weather and cropping patter, the Centre has chosen 185 districts across the country where seven selected crops are being promoted.Once complete, the findings of the project would be shared with all states to give to boost to cultivation of horticultural crops.States put into groupsDifferent states have been divided into different groups to grow banana, mango, citrus fruits, potato, tomato, onion and chilli.Sharing the progress of the project CHAMAN at a press briefing, Mr Singh said the Centre would convene a meeting of the northeastern states by January next year as the report on horticulture development for this region was ready.This sector provides nutrient rich crops to the people and better remunerative prices to the farmers and increases their incomes, Mr. Singh said.Under CHAMAN, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat and Maharashtra have been identified as the major banana-growing states. Mango cultivation is being promoted in Andhra, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana, while onion is the focus for Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh."
5a14dd5d9855b76bf13e89b3,Air raid shelter turns into urban farm in London,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/635636/air-raid-shelter-turns-urban.html,2017-09-30,,Deccan Herald,"Air raid shelter turns into urban farm in LondonAgence France-Presse, Sep 30 2017, 23:01 ISTUnder an anonymous back street in south London lies a vast underground air-raid shelter that has been turned into a pioneering urban farm supplying supermarkets and restaurants in the capital. The World War II shelter in Clapham, which could protect up to 8,000 people from Nazi German bombs, consists of two large tunnels that were intended to one day become an extension of the London Underground.That never happened and the shelter lay abandoned for 70 years until two entrepreneurs, Steven Dring and Richard Ballard, decided to grow broccoli, coriander, fennel and a host of other vegetables as so-called micro leaves, also known as micro herbs, grown from seedlings but harvested early when the first leaves form. We need to create these new fertile spaces to meet increased demand from a growing global population, Dring said on a visit to the Growing Underground site -- some 33 metres below the road.The vegetables are grown with hydroponics, using nutrient solutions in a water solvent instead of soil. The technique can also be used to grow a wide range of produce, including tomatoes and baby peppers, Dring said.The only other ingredient required is light. The tunnels have no natural light and are illuminated with pink LEDs, giving them a futuristic look.The intensity of the light changes to imitate daylight, but with one major difference -- the lights are dimmed during the day and shine brightest at night, as electricity is cheapest then. We predominantly grow micro herbs, which are standard herbs, from different seeds. But what we do is we grow them to a very small stage, before the first true leaves start to come out, Dring said.The micro herb broccoli takes between three and five days to grow before being packaged up in the shelter and sent off. Fans enthuse about the intensity of the flavours of the produce.Dring and Ballard latched onto the concept of vertical farming -- producing food in vertically stacked layers -- which was developed by US biologist Dickson Despommier in his 2010 book The Vertical Farm: Feeding the World in the 21st Century.The operation takes up some 200 metres of the 1,000 metres available in the air-raid shelter tunnel, half for growing while the other half is used for packaging. Their request to use the air-raid shelter in Clapham was eagerly taken up by the owners of the space, Londons public transport company.This type of farming is 100 times cheaper than setting up an urban farm on the surface, Dring said.Experts say vertical and urban farming could be ways not only of facing up to population growth but also growing urbanisation worldwide as well as climate change.The Growing Underground project sends its data on humidity, temperature and plant growth to Cambridge University to try and improve efficiency. What these guys are doing is modelling for us which one is the optimum environment for each product, Dring said. Every day is the same in the underground farm and there are no seasons, or unpredictable British weather."

To ensure better price for such farmers, a separate market was indeed necessary. As there would be huge demand for organic products, it is necessary for farmers to be transparent and committed.There is also the possibility of farmers deviating from the responsibilities and getting into the routine farming to meet the demand for supply using pesticides and fertilisers. Officials should be thoroughly invigilating and ensure that the organic farm products are only supplied in the market.He urged the farmers to take up organic farming to keep people away from diseases like cancers.District admin supportDeputy Commissioner Priyanka Mary Francis said Savayava Santhe will be held on Sundays. Non-certified materials should not be permitted. The produce would get better price and all marketing facilities will be provided by the district administration. The area would be made an organic hub. Around two tonnes of organic vegetables and fruits were sold out in barely two hours in the first market, she added.The Savayava Santhe had organic vegetables, foodgrains and fruits from Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Chikkamagaluru districts. Six organic farming clusters are established in Udupi district and 632 farmers have been practising organic farming on 655 hectares of land since 2013-14 under the Savayava Bhagya Yojane introduced by state government. The clusters include Hirebettu, Kadur, Kattingeri in Udupi, and Belinje in Karkala and Japti and Yelajith in Kundapur. Under the project, a Dakshina Kannada, Chikkamagaluru and Udupi Districts Regional Cooperative Organic Farmers Associations Federation is set up.The farmers in these clusters grow organic rice like Rajamudi and Kempakki and other products like rice flakes, organic jaggery, pulses, millets like navane, sajje, baragu, ragi, oodhalu, harake, organic vegetables and fruits, including tomato, ladies finger, gherkins, elephant yam, green chilli, leafy vegetables, bitter gourd, ash gourd, pomegranate, chikoo, beans, bananas and spices like onion, garlic, cardamom and pepper.There are 200 members in Dakshina Kannada, Chikkamagaluru and Udupi Districts Regional Cooperative Organic Farmers Associations Federation. Under the Federation, there are six organisations in Udupi, 11 in Dakshina Kannada and 27 in Chikkamagaluru. There are 3,000 hectares of farm land in the three districts earmarked to grow organic products.Farmers who grow organic products are certified by the organisation based in Bengaluru. There would be three years observation, after two years, the farmer can apply for the certification.The farmers are also into organic farming under the Paramparagatha Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) of the Union government in nine villages in Udupi district since 2015-16. As many as 292 farmers are following organic farming in 108 hectares of land under this scheme."
5a14e3fa9855b76bf13e8ceb,Wilderness on a,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/wilderness-on-a/article19904074.ece,2017-10-23,,The Hindu,"Every time Prateek Sadhu, executive chef at Mumbai-based restaurant Masque, pays the mountains a visit, he returns with close to a 100 kg of sea buckthorn, a modest Himalayan shrub with numerous medicinal benefits. Typically used by locals to construct fences, he converts the plant  also known as the Leh berry  into flavourful concoctions like citrusy-creamy sea buckthorn with black pepper mousse. Since Masques launch in 2016, exotic culinary delights  with seasonal foraged veggies like fiddleheads, wild cherries and tree tomatoes  have become top favourites among food enthusiasts. When you have such amazing produce, ideas come easily. The focus of Masque is to scale up the farm-to-table concept in India, and with people open to experimenting, the concept has caught on. Initially, our audience was restricted to Mumbai, but now travellers from across the globe recognise us as a dining destination, says Aditi Dugar, CEO, Masque.Inspired by Rene Redzepis (of Copenhagens Noma) foraging exploits, food lovers across Indias culinary landscape are bringing wild produce such as mud crabs and ghingharoo berries to city kitchens, and the trend is here to stay. According to Mumbai-based food writer, Vikram Doctor, the monsoon serves as the perfect season to forage, especially for tribal and farming communities. As they cant fish or farm, foraged food comes to the rescue of many communities who face a food crisis during this season, he says.For Pooja Pangtey and Teiskhem (Tei) Lynrah  the folks that started Mumbai-based pop-up restaurant, Meraki, last year  the art of foraging allows them to present unsuspecting Mumbaikars with a glimpse into the culturally rich kitchens of the Northeast. The knowledge handed down from our village folk has kept us connected with our culture, says Pangtey, who has introduced dishes with timila (wild figs) and kafal (red bayberries). In typical community-style dining, every edition of Merakis pop-ups follows a storytelling format where dishes like Wa khapa (Garo ginger pork) are presented coupled with a brief anecdote about their ingredients. When you read a book, you imagine what the author is trying to say. We wanted to create a similar experience, and were happy to see a change in the way locals think about what they grow, forage or eat, and what the city folk think about this type of food. Perceptions like people from the Northeast just eat a lot of meat are also changing, says Pangtey.Culture popForaging in India is anything but a new-age phenomenon, explains Doctor. We have a very long tradition of using foraged foods, and even today, women from tribal communities harbour most of the available knowledge on such edibles. Urmila Pawar, a Dalit writer from Konkan, writes about how women in her community would look for oysters on the coast; a treat they relish, he says. Foraging has also remained an integral part of religious rituals across the country. In the Angalaamman legend in Tamil Nadu, the goddess cooks a dish fromAgathileaves and chicken blood. Apparently, this dish is still prepared in certain temples as an offering to the deity, he adds.Beyond kitchensThe potent exercise of foraging isnt simply restricted to the kitchen. Kush Sethi, who heads digital communications for the Delhi Walk Festival, conducts foraging walks (between September and February). Venues include Lodhi Garden to discover edible plants  like wild amaranth and common mallow  that have been labelled weeds. Sethis motivation stems from his interest in studying weeds in an urban landscape, free from interventions like fertilisation and irrigation. Labelling a plant as a weed renders it useless and encourages people to litter in such spaces. But if someone promotes a particular plant as medicinal, the whole perception changes, says Sethi.Mumbai-based travel company, Kipepeo, also incorporates foraging walks in all its community-based tour itineraries. The idea stemmed from a conversation the founder, Piran Elavia, had with a tourist; and what followed was the creation of a product that puts the emphasis on local cuisine of the Northeast. I was surprised by the kind of vegetarian food people there forage and consume. They boil produce like the stinging nettle and flowers of the Nakima plant with rice, herbs, and some even add meat, says Elavia, who conducts foraging walks every six months.Fresh experimentsThe flavour these wild edibles lend to dishes and their presentation is what makes foraging a much-loved activity for chefs. Dugar, for instance, talks about their experiments at Masque with chestnuts. We foraged them along with the thorny shell and now have a range of dishes, like the chestnut brle served inside a chestnuts shell, chestnut and cacicovallo cheese (from Andhra Pradesh) and wild wood sorrel, explains Dugar. This foraging philosophy often finds its way to their bar as well. The bartender will try to use the same ingredients the kitchen is working with. For instance, while getting the sea buckthorn back in a carton, a lot of the juice had settled at the bottom. The bartender sieved it with a muslin cloth and infused gin-based drinks with it.Pangtey, who interacts with botanists who connect her with locals, explains how being well versed with local traditions is important, especially when exhibiting facets of a lesser known culture. In Uttarakhand, for example, there are close to 230 varieties of kidney beans. A lot of this produce is consumed by the families who grow them.Tracing the tightropeForaging, as enriching and lucrative as it sounds, presents its practitioners an equal share of challenges. The biggest being the short shelf life of the edibles.Countering this uncertainty, the people at Masque avoid getting a standard menu printed. The menu is often planned according to ingredients that reach the kitchen table. While there is a wishlist and its disappointing if we are not able to get that produce, we love the uncertainty that comes with foraging, says Dugar. For Sethi, explaining a seemingly unknown concept like foraging to commoners in order to get permissions to conduct walks, is the biggest hurdle. But weve got our secrets to deal with it! he says.Meanwhile, food historian and critic, Odette Mascarenhas says foraging demands a fair share of responsible execution. Our new-generation palate has been more open to exploration, and chefs are catering to that. But the preparations authenticity must remain intact, she insists. Though everything is subject to experiment, being the traditionalist that she prides herself to be, for her its imperative that something of the past is retained.You can reach Masque at022-2499 1010, Meraki at meraki.bombay@gmail.com,Kush Sethi, www.delhiwalkfestival.com and Kipepeo, www.facebook.com/kipepeo.india/When you have such amazing produce,ideas come easily.

Sreenivasa MurthyPeople who wanted to get back to their routine diet after Deepavali festivities were in for a rude shock. A steep increase in vegetable prices have ensured that there is no post-festival cheer that is usually the phenomenon when it comes to the prices of fruits and vegetables. Buying greens, especially, could burn a deep hole in your pocket.M. Vishwanath, managing director, Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS), said there had been a 20 to 40% increase in the prices of vegetables compared with last week.The steepest rise has been in the price of tomato, which costs Rs. 52 a kg now, and greens come at Rs. 150 to Rs. 200 a kg. Coriander, for example, costs Rs. 160 a kg now, he said.Prices of most vegetables are being reported to have nearly doubled in a month. Venkatesh G.M., manager at a supermarket chain, said the rates of tomatoes, for example, was up from Rs. 20 a kg last month to Rs. 45.The copious rainfall in Bengaluru and places around it such as Kolar, Chickballapur, Nelamangala, Malur, and Doddaballapur received in the last few weeks is said to be one of the contributing factors, mainly affecting the greens. In the wholesale market, coriander costs Rs. 160 to Rs. 180 a kg (from Rs. 100 about a fortnight ago), spinach Rs. 110 kg (from Rs. 60) and fenugreek Rs. 140 (from Rs. 60). Even beans costs Rs. 60 a kg, up from Rs. 40. During the festival, the rate had gone up to Rs. 80 and it should have normalised by now, said Mr. Venkatesh.The continuous rain since mid-August is said to have affected the late crops, as well as the new crops. The prices are expected to stabilise in about two months.We will have to wait for three months to get enough vegetables, said K. Srinivasa Gowda, a farmer in Kolar.Though vegetable prices in Kolar, a major centre of supplying vegetables to Bengaluru, have gone up owing to low yield following the recent rains, the rainfall is likely to help boost farming in the long run, with farmers having ample water for the summer months."

Prices that shot up after recent rains continue to remain high, deterring customers, the sellers say.K.V.S. GiriK.V.S. GIRIVegetable prices in the city continue to remain perched at increased rates despite monsoon withdrawal from the State nearing completion.Prices in the city increased during the first few days of October even as supply was affected. Vendors attributed the poor quality and high price of some commonly consumed vegetables to rains. A check of prices in government retail as well as wholesale markets suggested prices continue to pinch the common man.High quantityThough the quality and quantity has improved, the prices continue to be high. Customers have cut down on their purchase, said Venu Naik, a vegetable seller in Sainikpuri. The effect of rains in grower regions continue to affect prices.For instance, at the Bowenpally vegetable market, the arrival of hybrid variant of tomato had nearly doubled since the start of the month, accompanied with a three-time price increase. The variant was selling for a maximum price of Rs. 48 per kilo in the wholesale market. In retail markets however, the price was about Rs. 75 per kilo.The local variant of tomato is selling over Rs. 65 per kilo while the wholesale price stands at about Rs. 32 per kilo.Different pricesWhile potato and onion prices did not register a high, the cost of carrot continue to remain higher than its price last month. A kilo at Bowenpally market was listed at Rs. 55 on Tuesday. Carrot price in Rythu Bazars was around Rs. 70 with the private retail market demanding about Rs. 5 higher.The price of French bean at around Rs. 100 in the local private market, also remains higher than that of last month."

Only potato is available for Rs 13 per kg, giving a sigh relief to consumers. Even coriander leaf has become dearer by Rs 32 while green chilly is being sold at Rs 30 per kg.""I was shocked to see the prices of vegetables at Rythu Bazaar. Tomatoes which were being sold at Rs 13 per kg a week ago is now priced at Rs 30. Brinjals, which were being sold at Rs 18 a kg a few days ago, is now being sold at Rs 34 per kg, said S Dhanalakshmi, a homemaker.The exorbitant prices will continue for another two or three weeks till the end of Karthika Masam, claim traders. Till then, people have to bear the brunt of sky-rocketing prices.The month is famous for Vanabhojanam and Deekshas and many other traditions in the Hindu calendar. People observe fast and consume only vegetables, said N Veerababu, a trader at Rythu Bazar. When contacted, Rythu Bazar officials said the market procures vegetables from the neighbouring villages of Krishna and Guntur district on a daily basis and all those areas have seen bumper productions.They claimed that vegetable farmers would not suffer much loss as vegetable crops are harvested in phases. After a fortnight, the prices would stabilise bringing relief to the growers, they said."
5a14fe979855b76bf13e9b4b,"Fiscal recipe for growth: cut taxes, push up public spend",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/637237/fiscal-recipe-growth-cut-taxes.html,2017-10-10,,Deccan Herald,"Fiscal recipe for growth: cut taxes, push up public spendBy Ajit Ranade, Oct 10 2017, 23:59 ISTThe most important thing is to acknowledge the economic slowdown. For the past six quarters, the growth rate has steadily gone down from 9.2% to 5.7%. Investment as a share of GDP has been declining for five years. Job creation may not be just at a standstill, but sliding backwards. To some extent, this can all be viewed as the price to pay for the structural transformation of the economy. The price is paid in terms of political capital. Long-term measures have been undertaken, which have short-term costs, and can prove costly in electoral terms, too.A unified tax structure, direct linkage of farmers to buyers, attack on black money, determined effort to widen the tax net, financial inclusion, the move toward a less-cash economy are all steps toward a stronger and more efficient economic system in the longer term. But the government might be guilty of completely neglecting the here and now in pursuit of the long-term vision. After all, some of the jobs lost now are lost forever.Meals not served in restaurants during demonetisation wont come back in the future.When prices of perishables like tomatoes crash to Rs 3 a kilo, that is not compensated by better prices in the future. Many daily wage labourers who didnt find a job lost that livelihood, even if temporarily. Statistics confirm that all four basic drivers of growth (and spending) are sputtering: consumer spending, foreigner spending (that is, our exports), investment spending, and now even government spending.Economic revival is as much about psychology as about macroeconomic policy. Rising consumer and business confidence feeds off itself, and can lead to a virtuous cycle. The government and its spokespersons have as much responsibility to restore and enhance that confidence as to actually implement growth-enhancing policies. It helps to have credible promises and action plans, not just platitudes that all will be ok, this pain is only short-term.In times like these, it helps to refer to the eminent modern guru of economic policy, John Maynard Keynes. He understood that investors and consumers are as much moved by psychology as by economic incentives. Indians by nature are optimistic, as revealed by many global surveys, but that is not helping in the current times. The 80-year old wisdom of Keynesian economics still holds, despite many attempts to malign or discredit it. It is also no use being alarmist on Indias already high fiscal deficit ratio. Indias debt to GDP ratio is middling, and eminently sustainable. The pause in fiscal restraint fits in well with the new conventional wisdom put forth by worthies like the IMF in the wake of the European debt crisis.There is, of course, a price to pay for fiscal loosening. That price could be in terms of higher taxes in the future (to pay for new debt), or higher inflation. Both of these are acceptable costs. The unborn generation will bear a lower per-capita burden of taxes because of our demography. We can afford a slightly higher inflation rate, given that it has undershot even the RBIs target band.Finally, it is unfair to pin all our hopes on monetary loosening, and ignore the fiscal possibilities altogether. We need a well thought-out, well designed and implemented fiscal push now, not later.Revival packageSo, here is a list of fiscal options recommended as a much-needed timely fiscal package. First, recapitalisation of public sector banks. Burdened by NPAs, they are simply not in a position to extend new loans. This has caused credit growth to fall to the lowest in decades. The incremental credit-to-deposit ratio is deeply negative. Of course, we need not give the banks a blank cheque, so to speak. The recapitalisation could be tied to conditions and milestones, such as a time-bound resolution of top 10 NPAs, or speedy decisions on haircuts on stressed loans.The second area of fiscal priority is lower taxes. The corporate sector awaits the lower rate of 25%. More importantly, the excessive excise taxation on petrol and diesel must be reversed. Granted, it is in the domain of state taxes and that it lies outside the ambit of the GST council, but we need urgent relief on petro taxes. These are indirect taxes; they hurt the poor more than the rich, are regressive, do not give GST offset credit, and feed into generalised inflation through higher logistics and energy costs. Theres no point in filling the coffers of the governments and oil companies, and denying the benefits to the citizen.The third area is affordable housing. That will need a subsidy, mostly in land cost and interest subvention. The land should be acquired by governments (thats where thesubsidy comes in), and housing loan interest rate can be reduced. The state of Kerala has a successful pilot which can be emulated. Maharashtra is also implementing a large project, which includes rental housing, too.The fourth priority is a wage subsidy, especially for labour-intensive sectors like textiles (weaving, spinning, garment-making), construction and tourism. The state of Odisha has successfully innovated a scheme for garment makers which can be emulated. The NREGA can be extended to the textile sector. Wage subsidy and national accreditation should be given to apprentices, too, because most of the skilling is actually done as on the job training.A fifth priority is exporters. The issue of delay in GST refund has already been flagged. An expansion of the MEIS and SEIS schemes could be looked into. The fate of manufacturing and the export sector are interlinked.The sixth priority is farm incomes. Raising the MSP is a much-politicised issue. But there are crops outside the ambit of MSP. The government must examine ways of providing floor price support, although this helps only farmers with surplus to sell. There are many other specific measures to address the immediate need to rev up the economy. A fiscal push, in terms of lower taxes and higher government spending is an imperative.(The writer is an economist and senior fellow, Takshashila Institution)(The Billion Press)"

They were served rice, pulses, and a soyabean-potato curry; policemen provided for Santoshis familys security following threats from villagers. (Express Photo by Ratan Lal) Children eating mid-day meal at the school Santoshi was enrolled in. They were served rice, pulses, and a soyabean-potato curry; policemen provided for Santoshis familys security following threats from villagers. (Express Photo by Ratan Lal)Her hair brushed back, a comb tucked in her bun, Gudiya (26) is at ease this Tuesday afternoon. People from the administration are hovering around her, while six policemen keep a vigil on visitors. Officials from Jaldega block in Jharkhands Simdega district, a Naxal-dominated area, have come to the house in Karimati village to help the family encash a cheque of Rs 50,000 given by the administration to Gudiyas mother, Koyli Devi (45). They escort her to the bank located at Jaldega, where Koyli is told she can withdraw the money next week.Breastfeeding the youngest of her children, a two-and-a-half-year-old boy, half-an-hour later, Koyli talks of all she can buy with the money. Or could have bought for Santoshi. On September 28 night, her 11-year-old daughter died  Koyli says of starvation  seven months after the family stopped getting their rations as their Aadhaar wasnt linked to PDS. Later, the familys name was struck off the ration card list. Santoshi was the third child Koyli lost; the other two died of illness.Read | Santoshi died of starvationApart from the Rs 50,000 cheque and the Rs 15,000-odd in aid given by visiting leaders, Santoshis death has brought the family 75 kg of rice from the government and other benefactors, 20 kg of potatoes, two litres of edible oil, adequate kerosene oil, 10 soap bars, some green vegetables and tomatoes. Koyli is planning to stock up on more vegetables and pulses at the Wednesday haat.Then, once the cheque is encashed, Koyli will make other purchases. Family members are saying I should get a mobile phone. Also, we need things for the house. We will buy a box (suitcase), she says. The family, including Koyli, husband Tatya Naik, daughters Gudiya and Chando Kumari, and son Prakash, lives in a mud house, with mud-baked tiles for roof. The house comprises a large room, with a small area partitioned off as kitchen.The rest of the money she would keep in the bank, Koyli says, as saving  a new luxury for her.Earlier that day, Koyli indulged in another small luxury. When Chando, 8, asked for something to eat, she gave her Rs 10 to buy coconut biscuits. She likes fancy things to eat and was crying, Koyli says, with a faint smile.Santoshi was never fussy about food, the 45-year-old adds. She only kept asking for rice, but there was not a single grain at home.***************Rice for breakfast, rice for lunch, rice for dinner. Thats been Hemanti Kumaris routine all 10 years of her life. She is in Class 5 of Upgraded Primary School, Karimati. Santoshi cleared Class 5 from here too early this year, but never went on to the middle school (Classes 6 to 8), in the nearby Pangur hamlet.A sprightly girl, barely over 3 ft in height in her slippers and school uniform, Hemanti is happy as today has been a special day. In the morning, she made herself two chappatis and boiled some potatoes  that will be her evening snack, a rare fourth meal.Read | After starvation death case: Jharkhand minister scraps top state officials order on Aadhaar-PDS linkHer mother Padma Devi sits next to an earthen chulha, dug in the verandah of their mud house. She has placed twigs as cooking fuel, and from time to time, stirs a potato curry with tomatoes on the chulha.Hemantis father Gurucharan Mahato works as a labourer, taking up odd jobs. Padma cant do much work as both her legs are amputated. They live at her brother Nareshs home, and are grateful they have only two children to raise. Most families here have five to six children.Describing a regular day, Hemanti says she and her friends eat rice gruel in the morning, have rice with pulses and a seasonal vegetable for mid-day meal at school, and rice gruel again for dinner, sometimes supplemented with guda (a local shrub eaten raw). Only the mid-day meal sees variation, mostly in the form of papad and pickles on Saturdays, fruits three days a week, and eggs once a week.Shiv Nath Singh, a student of Class 3 in Hemantis school, has not gone to school. Mother Rukmani Devi remains silent when asked why. Putting plain rice before him for lunch, the 40-year-old says potatoes cost Rs 10 a kg. We cant get potatoes daily. We have pulses, but we only cook them sometimes.Ask what they consider a good meal, and she breaks into a laugh. Yahi sab na bhaat, daal, sabzi (Its all this only rice, pulses, vegetables). Once in a while, for a feast or a family function, villagers buy chicken or mutton.PDS doesnt provide more than 150-250 gm of rice per person per day on a ration card (see box). With their large sizes, families struggle to feed mouths. In the open market, rice of similar or lower grade costs at least Rs 22 a kg, while 2.5 litres of kerosene that they are also entitled to under PDS comes for Rs 75. Families cant afford these rates, and even buy their ration in bits and pieces as they never have enough money to buy in bulk.As per the October 2017 figures on the Jharkhand governments portal, 2,212 people in Karimati are under the PDS. Villagers claim almost every household has one members Aadhaar linked to their ration card.After Santoshis death, officials suspended the licence of the PDS dealer and Block Supply Officer for failing to ensure uninterrupted ration supply to her family, despite non-matching of Aadhaar. On October 21, Jharkhand Minister for Public Distribution System and Consumer Affairs Saryu Roy annulled an order by Chief Secretary Rajbala Verma to delete ration cards not linked with Aadhaar.***************I know families in Karimati who just scrape through, says Sudama Kachhap, a para-teacher heading the Upgraded Primary School. Santoshi used to be his student.Kachhap says Santoshis mother had promised to send her to middle school. But she didnt They are just so poor, he says.Even in this village of mainly daily wage labourers and farmers with small fields and poor yields, Kachhap adds, there was no family in as pitiable a state as Santoshis. Agar is gaon mein koi antim vyakti ya antim parivar hai, to yahi hai. Inse buri sthiti kisi ki nahin hai (If there is that last man or last family in this village, they are the one. Nobody is in as poor a condition as them), the 40-year-old says.(Express Photograph by Ratan Lal) (Express Photograph by Ratan Lal)As part of his duties, Kachchap also supervises the mid-day meal at the school.For the allocated Rs 4.13 per child per day, a mid-day meal is supposed to provide 450 gm of calories and 12 gm of proteins to children at the primary level. Children in middle school (Classes 6-8), are entitled to Rs 6.18 per day, for 700 calories and 20 gm proteins. Additionally, at Rs 4 per child per day, egg or seasonal fruit is given to the students on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.If the school remains closed for, say, four days, more than 90 per cent children would have eaten only rice those days, says Kachhap.The rations for the mid-day meal are sourced from the PDS block godown. The cost of the cook, appointed locally, comes out of the money allocated for children. Kachhap says the money is too less, going by the prices of eggs and vegetables that they have to buy from the open market, but they manage.There is another reason Kachchap is closely linked to Santoshis case. Till September last year, this para-teacher was also the Booth Level Officer (BLO) of Karimati, responsible for ensuring that villagers got themselves enrolled in Aadhaar, and got ration cards made. But, following an order that para-teachers should not be engaged in non-teaching works, his name was struck off.Read | Jharkhand starvation case: Girls family heckled out of village, now back homeHowever, since Kachchap knew the people, he continued to do the work. We have got complaints against him and are inquiring, says Jaldega Block Development Officer (BDO) Sanjay Kongari, referring to charges that Kachchap took money to get ration cards made. Kachchap denies the allegations.Hirawati Kumari, 17, claims he demanded Rs 1,600 from the family for a ration card. Her father Chhotu Ram died 18 months ago and her mother Keriyo Devi sustains the family working as a help in houses or through odd jobs in fields, earning around Rs 50 per day.Without a ration card, the family depends on the PDS Chhotu Rams elder brother gets. Giving a break-up of what it costs to buy from the market, Hirawati talks about last Wednesday when the family got 10 kg rice from the haat for Rs 22 per kg. Mother took an advance from a person she works for. She will now work four-five days without any reimbursement to pay back. She spent an additional Rs 30 to buy 3 kg of potatoes.Its a week later, and the family of four is left with only some rice, potatoes and guda. Hirawati says they have run out of sugar, tea and kerosene.She is lucky though, the 17-year-old amends. Thanks to her enrolment at Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya, 7 km away, where she studies in Class 8, she gets regular food. These schools were set up to ensure quality education for girls, predominantly from SC/ST, OBC and minority communities, in difficult areas, and admit children after a test. Hirawatis younger siblings, aged 10 and 4, depend on help from relatives.***************At Karimatis anganwadi centre, K D Chaudhary, the in-charge of the Jaldega Community Health Centre (CHC), is holding a health check-up camp. That is another thing Santoshis death has brought to Karimati. Chaudhary admits he does not remember the last time such a camp was held in the village, though a mobile medical van does the rounds every three-four months.Accompanying him is Dr Binod Oraon, the single man responsible for 174 primary schools and 132 anganwadi centres in Jaldega under the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram. It is an initiative under the National Health Mission for early intervention for children from birth to 18 years to cover 4 Ds  Defects at birth, Deficiencies, Diseases, and Development delays.Ask when he last visited Karimati, and Dr Oraon tells you to do the math. There are 365 days in a year. You add 174 and 132. Plus, there are several other issues to be looked into. How many times can I come in a year?Chaudhary is despondent about what he has seen so far at the health camp. Alcoholism is rampant. Their livers are weak, eyes are damaged, many have lost their senses. Jaundice, Hepatitis, TB There is severe lack of awareness, he reels off.As for malaria, the official cause of Santoshis death, Chaudhary says it is common, though not endemic. In fact, no malaria deaths have been reported from here in the last few years.***************Its easy to slip out of the net, like Santoshi and her family did. BDO Kongari claims it was technicalities that led to their name being taken off PDS list.Koylis husband Tatya, who also went by the name Tetwa, had a ration card. A few years ago, the government policy was changed when it was felt that ration cards should be in the name of women heads of the family, as they were more sincere. Ideally, in Koylis case, Tatyas name should have been replaced by Koylis. But, somehow, it got transferred to the name of Balmati Devi, Tatyas mother. The problem is that Balmati died 10 years ago, he says.In 2016, the Point-of-Sale (PoS) machine system was introduced, for biometric identification through Aadhaar of ration card holders. It required the Aadhaar number of at least one member of the family to be linked to their ration card. Both Koyli and Gudiya had Aadhaar since 2013. But nobody from the family got their Aadhaar linked to the ration card, as a result of which Balmatis name finally got deleted, says Kongari.Right to Food Campaign activist Tara Mani Sahu, who had raised the issue of Koylis ration card when Santoshi was alive, says, I tried to raise the matter at the district level, but nothing happened. We also get constant complaints about beneficiaries getting less than entitled ration. Dealers cut 1-2 kg, giving one or the other reason.There are also cases of members of families left out of ration cards. In the case of Lal Card holders (see box), the amount of ration a family gets will be less, points out Sahu.Kongari, however, maintains that the process of Aadhaar seeding with schemes has been smooth, and that nearly 100 per cent of the work is done in his block. New people will be added, but for all the programmes using direct benefit transfer (DBT, cash being transferred into accounts), Aadhaar seeding is almost complete, he says.But some villagers complain about MNREGA payments being irregular. Dupatti Devi worked under MNREGA a year ago and should have got over Rs 3,500. But she has got just Rs 800, she claims. Her husband Bideshi Baraik, she says, is a pagla  a euphemism for a chronic alcoholic in these parts. With four children to support, Dupatti is desperate. Only I know how I run my house, she says.District Supply Officer Nanki Ram admits there are problems. But we are trying to put in place a system where beneficiaries get payment without middlemen. Some names may have got left out. We are launching campaigns to get them enlisted, he says.PDS minister Saryu Roy says, What I mentioned in the order (annulling the order of the Chief Secretary), the same thing has now been said in a circular of the Government of India. It is very clear-cut (that non-linking of Aadhaar should not be used to deny benefits).Further, Roy says, he has asked the department to provide him month-wise and reason-wise break-up of the 11.3 lakh ration cards deleted after the PoS system was introduced. In the same period, the department has added nine lakh beneficiaries. I want to be sure that any deserving candidate has not got his name struck off, he says.***************Among the villagers, Santoshi or Koyli find no sympathy, with the people backing officials assertion that she died of malaria. Aaj ka jug mein koi bhookh se mare hao (Does anybody die of hunger in this day and age)? questions a woman.With Tatya unable to work, Koyli and Gudiya support the family through odd jobs at Lachragarh, or collect wood from the jungle and sell it at Rs 30-Rs 40 per bundle. The day-long task of picking up the twigs, bundling and selling them fetches only a little more. Labourer jobs, for around Rs 200 a day, are few and far between.None of the villagers was around to witness Santoshis slow descent to death, Gudiya recalls. Koyli had not been going to work. There was no rice for 15 days and, in the last eight days, the family went without a meal. Let alone rice, there was no salt, sugar, kerosene, not even a match-stick.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

That results in a per capita investment of $406.73 this year. Thats a drop in the bucket compared to the assets under management that are expected in the Robo Advisors category in India between 2017 and 2021, with a compound annual growth rate of 97.4%. Experts readily agree that the total value of assets under management with Robo Advisors in India will be worth approximately $100 million by 2021. Additionally, some 200,000 traders and investors are expected to be using Robo Advisors by that time. Compared to the USA, where Robo Advisors are adopted across the board, the total value of assets under management is some $182.505 billion.Why Are Robo Advisors So Popular in Canada, the US and Europe?Part of the problem with investing is understanding the investment terms, investment phraseology, investment landscape, and investment dynamics. These complicate the process of making investments in stocks, commodities, indices, currency pairs and the like. Financial services have evolved  thanks to innovative financial technology (FinTech)  to allow regular investors to dabble in the markets. People have long been seeking do-it-yourself-style investments, and one of the simplest ways to do this is a Robo Advisor.The technology is sufficiently advanced today to make it possible for individuals to successfully implement trading and investing activity via this high-tech platform. A Robo Advisor is not a robot; it is a financial advisor offering a full range of services to clients. They are not automatons  they simply exclude human beings from stock selection. The fact of the matter is that humans are not adept at choosing stocks for clients. If they were, we would all have a much higher success rate in the financial markets. Fortunately, Robo Advisors are managed and controlled by human beings, meaning that all customer service interactions will be conducted with real human beings.Robo Advisors Dramatically Cutting Costs in IndiaTraders across India get to enjoy the same Robo Advisor benefits from these services, like in Canada. Today, Robo Advisors are used for managing increasing components of personal financial portfolios. There are many benefits to using Robo Advisors in your day-to-day operations. For starters, these resources can provide up to 98% of the data, knowledge and information-based resources that are needed to begin trading and building a financial portfolio.There are many other benefits including Light Advice (information varies from one company to the next), improved investment options over mutual funds, an easy and effective way to invest your capital, easy to implement contribution methods, and the like. The websites that provide Robo Advisors are equally appealing to users, meaning that its click and pick functionality for the layman.Some financial writers have likened Robo Advisors to set and forget ways of investing. It should be stressed that Robo Advisors are not an impersonal way of taking money from you through robotic mediums of exchange. The FinTech Enterprises offering Robo advisor services are geared towards making it easier for anyone to invest money through smart technology. Its a DIY option for those who eschew big banks, financial corporations, and brokers in their ivory towers.You can conduct purchases of exchange traded funds, stocks, bonds, Forex, indices and commodities at your leisure.

5a15126a9855b76bf13ea9b6,Let’s start at the very beginning,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2017/oct/24/lets-start-at-the-very-beginning-1682002.html,2017-10-24,,The New Indian Express,"CHENNAI: This week, we will cover about seed germination and transplanting.Seeds, where it all begins!There are various types of seeds  heirloom (naati), open pollinated (o/p), hybrid. However, heirloom or o/p seeds have the highest germination rate. A seed packet marked as F1 are hybrid varieties. A very common question asked by newbies is, the seed packets have Poison mentioned on the packets, is it safe to use them? They are completely safe to use for sowing purposes. The seeds are coated with a very thin layer of chemical so that the seeds do not rot or decay and have a longer shelf life.For plants such as methi, dill, etc seeds from the kitchen cupboard work but the germination rate is low, as they are processed for kitchen use. Most folks start off with buying seeds initially. Once they form a good network of gardening enthusiasts, they exchange seeds at meets and events. There are quite a number of green events held in Bangalore, which have stalls dedicated for selling seeds and saplings.GerminationOne can invest in a seeding/ germinating tray. A basic one costs about `50. Else you can also reuse/recycle egg shells, coconut shells, milk packet, juice cartons, curd cups etc. The most basic need for a seed to germinate is moisture. For making a germinating potting mix, you can take a few handfuls of cocopeat and compost, with some neem powder.The quantity of the ingredients need not be exact, since it will house the plant for just about 1-2 weeks. Germination time depends on various reasons like climate, source and health of the seeds. On an average seeds of bushy vegetable plants like tomato, brinjal, chilly take roughly 10 days. Methi seeds sprout in just 3-4 days.- Fill the germinating container with the above germinating potting mix.- Moisten the whole tray, by spraying water gently.- Make a small hole in the middle of each slot, with your finger/pencil, just a few millimeters deep.- Place the seed in the hole. Its a good idea to place 2-3 seeds so that at least one will germinate. Also there are sometimes lots of seeds in a single seed packet, which eventually one does not end up using. Use your own judgement !- Cover the holes with the potting mix around the slot, then give a very gentle press.- Place the tray in a bright but shaded place, away from direct sunlight.Sapling / TransplantingWhen you are transplanting from the seeding tray to the final container, make sure you are not doing it under direct sun. Do it around 6-7 am or 5-6 pm. Use extreme caution when taking out the sapling. Make sure that the stem along with the root structure and soil around the roots come out as a whole. Before taking the sapling out, you can gently press the outside of the seedling tray slot or container. You can use a spoon/fork to take out the sapling. Over a period of time, you will master this trick. TIP: If you plan to have, say, five tomato plants, then its a good idea to sow 10 seeds, just in case you loose some during the sowing, germinating or transplanting.In the final container make a hole in the middle, wide and deep enough to hold the sapling. If you have some cow dung, you can place it in the hole, before placing the sapling, so that the young plant gets some extra nutrition to sustain its initial days.Once transplanted, keep the container in a shady place. This will enable the sapling to bear the transplant shock. Water the container carefully, so as not to harm the sapling, as mentioned in the tips above. If at the initial stage (after transplanting), you feel that your plant needs support, you can stake the plant for support. Staking is placing a thin but strong piece of wood (similar to pencil). Insert it into the pot near the seedling, but not too close to the roots. Use a thread and tie the sapling loosely to the stick. This will give some support to the plant for the first few weeks of its life.Enjoy watching your plant grow from a seed over a few weeks and months!"

We caught up with the Delhi-based writer, painter and travel enthusiast ahead of the launch of her debut novel She and He in the city on November 25. Love and relationships define our very being, yet sometimes we forget its significance in our lives. We live very mechanical lives these days. My book is a reminder for this generation that love is everything, she smiles.A self-admitted hopelessly hopeful romantic, she says that the book focuses on the many facets of the man-woman relationship - both the simple and difficult. I have compared it with Yin-Yang and Siva-Sakti, where one is incomplete without the other. You cannot spark a dialogue on one aspect, without talking about the other. It is symbiotic, organic yet complex, she laughs.So what exactly prompted her to explore the dynamics of this puzzling bond? All that I have written is a reflection of my own experiences with relationships, and also those of my friends and family. I think personal anecdotes tend to make the narrative stronger and make people connect with the story better, she avers. I am an engineer with a mass communication degree, but writing has always been on my mind. From the 15-year-old about to touch the flames of love for the first time to a senior citizen, who has endured what life has thrown at him or her, I believe that everybody will be able to relate to the plot.Though this is the first time that Astha has penned a book on the subject, it is not the first time that she has tried to creatively express the dimensions of the man-woman relationship. As I am an artist as well, I had already come up with an exhibition of paintings based on the same theme in 2015. I also plan to do a She and He cookbook, featuring simple recipes with flavours that marry well. For example garlic bread and tomato soup, and even a short story series soon, she grins.Word of adviceAfter being turned down by publications, Astha decided to just go for it and self-publish her book. She recommends the same to aspiring writers.She & He is available on Amazon and is priced at `500"

My motive behind gardening is to give my family and neighbours chemical-free food, says 53-year-old Poonam Bhide, who lives at Viman Nagar in Secunderabad.Started gardening in 1979, she says that we should let Nature the way it is and not tamper with it. She had never thought of gardening until she came across Facebook groups promoting organic gardening. Out of curiosity she joined the groups and went on to discover the beauty and benefits of gardening. Inspired by gardeners across the country, from just a flower garden she has now developed an organic garden. This garden is spread out in an area of approximately 175 yards. Currently, she is growing vegetables like brinjal, cucumber, snake gourd, tomatoes, chilly, drumstick, and potatoes. She says, I have not bought vegetables from the market for the past two years. The produce from the garden is self-sufficient and I also give the extra to my neighbours. Fruits include guava, papaya, pomegranate and coconut. From her produce, she makes jams, chutneys and healthy drinks.Adding to the list, she also specialises in terrace gardening. She does not use any kind of container for the plants. Layers of fertile soil are developed directly on the slab. The making of soil layer is a four-month-long process. Slab beds with dimensions 12 by 3 feet using a mix of leaf litter and soil. She also grows 26 varieties of leafy vegetables. She not only specialises in growing indigenous plants but also exotic plants. Exotic plants include passion fruit creeper and vengeri brinjal. She takes extra care of the exotic plants and has successfully grown 10-feet tall plant of vengeri brinjal variety. Apart from this, medicinal plants are abundantly found in her garden. In a city where there is water scarcity, she is trying to promote the idea that throughout the year, soil needs to be covered with mulch. This helps prevent evaporation of water. Outdoor burning of waste and leaf litter is not advisable. So composting and mulching comes to the rescue.Composting is a microbial process that converts plant materials such as grass clippings and leaves to a more usable organic soil amendment or mulch. Gardeners have used compost for centuries to increase soil organic matter, improve soil physical properties, and supply some of the essential nutrients for plant growth. Mulching refers to the practice of applying a layer of materials such as compost, leaves, or grass clippings to the soil surface in order to modify soil temperature and moisture as well as control weeds and soil erosion, she explains. She traps rainwater in and around her residence to water her plants. Gate valves are switched to direct water from washing machine and bathrooms into garden pipes which are directed into soil and specific plants. Kitchen waste water is also stored to water plants during summer.Poonam is a theatre and Hindustani music enthusiast. Gardening gives me peace of mind. I love to be in tune with nature."

My whole family felt safe there. We were content with nature, with the birds and the squirrels, and we all ate idlis together in my garden, recalls Lakshmi Venkatasubramaniyan, with tears in her eyes. CE spoke to her about her 1,200sqft garden and the techniques she follows to maintain it. The 45-year- old has been terrace gardening since 2002, starting with flowering plants.Lakshmi Venkatasubramaniyanin her gardenHer garden, with 5ft trimmed trees such as red guava, chikku, star fruit, custard apple, varieties of drumstick, tamarind, herbs such as stevia (good for diabetics), Thai and Italian basil, krishnar tulsi, flowering plants such as jasmine including ramabanam and ramar malli, adeniums (dessert rose), thazhampoo, vegetables such as multivitamin spinach- all vitamins, bay leaf constituting to more than 300 plants, shows her passion for plants.Those days, my father grew ladys finger and tomato and my mother plucked flowers from our own plants. It was a part of our life. Thats how I started, she says. However, she was new to terrace gardening when she began. The BSc Math graduate gained knowledge from Namaalwar books, videos, facebook pages and a lot of other books on gardening techniques. I struggled to change from traditional pot mixes, which contained, red soil, river soil and cow dung, to the modern method of adding coco pete to the soil, she says. Coco pete or coir pith is a spongy medium that when mixed with soil, can retain water in it and makes the pot mix loose and lightweight for terrace gardening.One blunder she talks about is blindly following books that instruct people to 'pluck leaves that are infected'. Each day, I plucked one leaf of peerkanga and one day only the stem remained, she laughs.When space hinders gardening, she suggests beginners to do plant companion planting where a tree, herb and creeper can be grown together. Grow kaaramani, fenugreek and thatta payiru as companion plants with other plants, as they are nitrogen fixating plants. Vertical garden can be opted for if there is no space. Customised pots are available to be fixed on the wall, she says.If spending for plants hinders gardening, dont worry, she has solutions for that too. Replace jute bags, milk packets, aata bags, watermelon skin, egg shell or orange skin if grow bags are not affordable.I have remodeled a tire in to a container for spinach and it works out well, she shares.The right time to sow seeds is aadi maasam, she says. October- January winter vegetables such as carrot, coriander, broccoli, exotic veggies, stevia and strawberry can be grown.While all want to get rid of pests, she says that good pests follow bad pests. So we cant completely eradicate pests, but can distract them with 3G, perungayum, buttermilk, panjakavya, jeevamrithum which is made by processing cow dung, cow urine, handful of garden soil, besan flour for three days. On the fourth day, dilute it with water in 1:10 ratio to enrich the microbes in the soil.Plants in turn take nutrition from them. Strong smell of herbs such as mint, neem leaves, karpuravalli and tulsi can also distract bad pests by covering the smell of other plants.I buy red sand, seeds, cow dung and bone meal which is rich in phosphorus from the Cathedral road nursery, she says, as she believes the place is reliable. She has been awarded the 'Outstanding Gardener' award 2015 at Chennai gardens meet, organic garden foundation, and first prize in best terrace garden competition held by VGP trust in September, 2016."

And for the health conscious among us, what if the thokku was made out of bittergourd or capsicum? Will you still say yes to it? Meet Rajalakshmi Allen, who began Jhos Kitchen in January this year out of her sheer passion for food and cooking. I was pursuing my PhD part-time and had to discontinue due to health issues. So while I was at home, I thought of doing something and at the same time take care of my daughter too. So I entered this field, she explains.Rajalakshmi Allen with her motherThe venture which is named after her two-and-a-half year old daughter Joshita, she says is run by her family. I havent employed anybody from outside. It is solely run by me and my family. Every member in the family helps out and this is the result of their support, she smiles.From podis, appalam and thokku to different varieties of ready rice mix, Jhos kitchen caters to most South Indian vegetarian dishes. Their speciality however is their variety of thokku  onion, green chilli, capsicum, ginger, bittergourd, tomato, garlic, etc. I do cook continental and north Indian food as well. But, for the time being I am only selling my South Indian varieties. I try and experiment with as many vegetables as possible to make my thokku. These are the ones you wont get anywhere in the market. People often assume that bittergourd thokku will be extremely bitter and dont prefer it, but it doesnt have a bitter taste  it is a mix of flavours she points out.What quantity is the thokku sold at? I sell a minimum of 100 grams. The prices usually vary with the availability of the vegetable in the market, like the pudhina podi  when the prices in the market go down; I buy it and make the podi. I always prepare it fresh and dont store it for longer period. So is the case with the pickles too  lime, mangoes, gooseberry  it all depends on the season, she adds.Apart from the regular sambar and rasam mix, Rajalakshmi also makes the Kandanthippili rasam podi, which has many medicinal values. It is very good for curing ailments like cold, cough and fever.Although Rajalakshmi hasnt done any marketing for her venture yet, she says that the responses have been good so far. When people taste it, they come back for more. Mostly people learn about Jhos Kitchen through word of mouth. The stall at Kadaiveedhi was my first till now and I have learnt so much through this.What was the best compliment you got so far? The best compliment was that my capsicum thokku is awesome. It started with vengaya thokku, when people said that it was awesome, then it shifted to other vegetables, she says. With a set of compliments from those who buy and constant support an motivation from her family, Rajalakshmi seems all pumped up to take her venture further and even plans to introduce more varieties of thokku.For details, call: 9445614242"

As a child, I got to eat the best homemade food rich in spices. My grandmother and mother were both passionate about cooking.Her favourite dish: Majjige Huliconsecutive days. When asked to share the recipe for the same, she said: First cut the ash gourd to small cubes and put them to boil in a vessel. Then grind green chillies, cumin, coconut, coriander leaves, chana dal and moong dal. Once the ash gourd is soft, add the masala and boil. Later, add curd and cook for one boil. Oil, mustard and curry leaves could be used for seasoning. The delicious curry will be ready.Indian food in foreign kitchensHema Malini Devi has held several cooking workshops across the globe. I was once invited by Berea University to give presentation on the spices and conduct cooking workshops. I taught them the significance of spices and South Indian delicacies. Everyone enjoyed the sessions and since then, I have cooked Indian food umpteen times in foreign kitchens, says Hema. I have travelled to San Francisco, Taos in New Mexico, Houston, London and several European countries to conduct cooking workshops.

Farmers in state have already suffered successive droughts since 2015, and more rains could result in huge losses for them. Experts feel there will be a surge in post-harvest diseases if such moist conditions persist throughout October. Dr N Nagaraj, Professor of Plant Pathology, University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS) told Express that if it rains heavily during October, farmers tend to harvest their crops early.Due to such showers, it becomes a problem for farmers to dry and store the produce. As a result, post-harvest diseases such as formation of moulds will increase and hurt revenues of the farmer, he said. Quoting the example of an experimental plot of UAS, he said that the plot of land that used to give 200 kg of harvest might provide a maximum harvest of 140 kg of vegetables this year. Perishable crops like tomato are affected by diseases such as Phytophthora Late Blight. Other crops such as papaya, chillies and vegetables will be affected due to spell of rains, he said.Crops such as moong bean, maize, jowar and ragi too are not exempt from the consequences of such weather. Paddy is among the few crops that will not be affected much, he said. However, rains effect ragi, when earheads are growing in the plants. If water stands in the ragi form, the earheads will sprout, leading to loss for farmers, he said. Shivkumar Naiklal, scientist at Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Cell said that overcast conditions also effect crops which are about to flower. He said that 99% of the State had adequate moisture in soil, after two years of moisture stress due to drought."

Started by Bikash Parikh, who worked in the sports sector earlier but had a dream of starting his own place, the concept of the restaurants is driven on him wanting to break the myth that healthy, vegetarian food isn't tasty.The menu is limited, and the food is all made fresh. We don't store anything, the food is all made fresh. And because of that, if your meal takes about ten minutes more to get ready, says Parikh.We started the meal with a carrot and ginger juice and a peanut butter smoothie topped with granola. Both were delicious and just right on the sweetness factor. The Mezze Platter looked healthy, sounded healthy and was high on taste, with homemade multigrain breads, beetroot humus, chia seed humus and tahini. Next was the Raw Papaya and Soba Noodle with Som Tum dressing salad  one of the best raw papaya salads we have tried of late, with just the right amount of Asian flavours and spice. We also tried the Vietnamese Pho with Soba Noodles, the flavours hit the spot that chilly evening. Global cuisine at pure vegetarian eateries wasn't common in the city. This is something I wanted to change, and that's why you find Asian, Italian, Mexican cuisine on the menu, says Parikh.For the mains, we tried the Whole Wheat Spaghetti with Tomato Ragout and the Cottage Cheese steak with Mexican Rice. The spaghetti had a very home cooked feel to it, as did most of the food, and was loaded with vegetables. Though not a fan of cottage cheese, the steak was grilled and topped with a sauce that complemented it perfectly, and when paired with the rice and grilled vegetables, the overall experience was a satisfying one.If you want something sweet (and healthy) after your meal, ask for the special of the day. Although they didn't have any of the specials that day, as the desserts are all made with fresh ingredients, we did sample some sweet treats from the in-house bakery called The Bakehouse. We tried an oreo chesecake and a salted caramel tart, both of which tasted like they came out from your mother's oven, simple, flavoursome and comforting.The decor is also eco-friendly. The limestone and mud walls, along with the rustic artifacts and restored teak wood floors, resonate Prikh's belief of keeping things local, and that you don't have to spend exorbitant amounts to make a space look good.If you're in the mood to eat simple and healthy, then Little Green Cafe is just for you.

(Source: AP) Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses the gathering during dedication of a new Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) campus at Gandhinagar. (Source: AP)We have been great admirers of Gujarats agrarian miracle when Narendra Modi was the states chief minister from October 7, 2001 to May 22, 2014. Gujarats agri-GDP registered an unprecedented growth of 8 per cent per annum during 2002-03 to 2013-14, way more than the all-India figure of 3.3 per cent per annum (Graph 1). Gujarats agri-growth was even higher than that achieved by Punjab during the Green Revolutions heydays (5.7 per cent per annum during 1971-85). This gave Modi a big political dividend and he was returned to the CMs office thrice. It was good economics and good politics.So, when Modi became the prime minister in May 2014, one was expecting that the Gujarat model would be extended to many states  of course with the fine-tuning to suit each states requirements. But the growth of all-India agri-GDP in the first three years of NDA rule has come down to 1.8 per cent. This is less than half of what was achieved during the last three years of the UPAs rule (Graph 2). Deficient rain in 2014-15 and 2015-16 is of course one factor behind this poor performance. But there were bumper harvests in 2016-17, yet farmers suffered due to a collapse in agri-prices. The advance estimates of 2017-18 do not indicate much recovery, and the agri-growth in the first four years under the Modi government may turn out to be around 2 per cent per annum.Here we focus on how to get Indian agriculture on a path where it can have a growth rate of least 4 per cent  although it has the potential to grow at 5 per cent or even a little more; the productivity levels of Indian agriculture are very low by international standards. The promise of doubling farmers income by 2022 cannot be fulfilled if agri-growth remains subdued at 2 per cent per annum. So, what can the prime minister do at this juncture? Should he set up another expert committee or just look back at the agrarian miracle achieved under his leadership in Gujarat, learn some important lessons, and fine tune them at the all-India level?In order to answer these questions, one needs better diagnosis of Gujarats excellent agri-performance when Modi was the states chief minister. Our research at ICRIER shows that the states agri-growth was driven by four factors. First, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee governments bold decision to allow the commercial use of Bt cotton became a catalyst for change, from which Gujarat benefited the most. From nowhere in 2002, Bt cotton spread to more than 90 per cent of the area under cotton in Gujarat by 2014. Production at the all-India level increased from 14 million bales in 2002-03 to 39.8 million bales by 2013-14, as per the Cotton Corporation of India. Indias raw cotton export increased from a meagre $10 million to $4,258 million by 2011-12, making the country the worlds second largest cotton producer and exporter (Graph 3). A forthcoming study, of which Ashok Gulati is a co-author, shows that the cumulative gain from import saving, extra raw cotton export and extra yarn export  compared to the business-as-usual scenario  between 2003-04 and 2016-17 is estimated to be $67.4 billion at the all-India level. Cotton from Gujarat had a big share in these exports. If cotton export had been banned, this revolution would not have fructified. Access to the best markets is, therefore, as important as access to the best seeds.Second, it may be worth recalling that the Bt cotton seeds came from a global seed company  Monsanto  in association with an Indian partner Mahyco, and then multiplied by several licensees. In this context, it is interesting to see that while China is taking over Syngenta for $43 billion to access the best technologies for its farmers, the Centre is creating conditions that may force companies like Monsanto to quit. This government is literally reversing the benefits that the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government bestowed to farmers.The third key lesson from the Gujarat story relates to providing basic infrastructure to farmers  irrigation, power and roads enabled the easy adoption of Bt cotton, and benefited other crops and the livestock sector as well. Check dams, bori bandh and khet talavadi provided life-saving irrigation, while the Jyotigram Yojana helped improve rural electrification. Another crucial infrastructure for agri-growth is all-weather roads. Currently, Gujarat has one of the best road-network in the country, with 930 km of roads per 1,000 sq km, of which 89 per cent are pucca/surfaced roads.Fourth, good marketing institutions propelled Gujarat agriculture, especially its dairy industry. The AMUL model of directly buying milk from farmers cooperatives and processing and distributing it through millions of outlets ensures that farmers receive 75-80 per cent of the consumers price. This model is worth extending to other commodities, especially fruits and vegetables, bypassing the mandi system. It is time to launch Operation Veggies TOP (Tomatoes, Onions and Potatoes) on the lines of Operation Flood.What are the key lessons, then, from CM Modi to PM Modi? First, enable farmers to access best technologies and best markets at home or abroad; second, invest in basic infrastructure that can give access to water for irrigation, power and rural roads; and third, create AMUL type institutions for other commodities to enable farmers to access high share of consumers price. Export bans or high minimum export prices for agri-products are anti-farmer. The government should use satellites and drones to identify places appropriate for building check dams across the country and use the MGNREGA workforce to build such dams. It should ensure farmers get power either through the grid or solar panels, and supplement this with micro-irrigation (drips and sprinklers) to get more crop, per drop.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Heavy rains that lashed the state in the past two months have pushed up the prices of vegetables. While the price of tomato has gone up from Rs 20 to Rs 40 per kg in the retail market, it has jumped from Rs 22 to Rs 49 per kg at HOPCOMS. Similarly, the price of chilli has doubled from Rs 40 to Rs 80 per kg in the retail market. Coriander, that must ingredient, is out of reach: it has jumped from Rs 25 to Rs 50 per bunch in the retail market. And this trend is likely to continue for another 15 days.Vegetable prices have soared in Mysuru, Hubballi and Mangaluru too. Market experts say that the unusual pattern of rainfall is to be blamed for the price rise. Vendors said that since the crops have been destroyed in rain-abundant districts, prices have skyrocketed. G R Srinivas, former president, HOPCOMS, said, Wherever rainfall has been more, crops have been damaged. It will take another month or two for the next crop to be successfully harvested. Till then the prices will see an inflation.Russell Market Traders Association General Secretary Idrees Chaudhury said, Farmers say the situation wont improve for another 15 days. Customers who purchased one kilo of produce are buying quarter kilo. Sales have dropped.A vendor in Shivajinagar, Mohammed Shahnawaz, said, It is not just rain that played spoilsport. Due to the festival, farmers arent working in the field. So, we have no option but to hike prices.Nagabhushana K S, a resident of Kengeri who shopped in KR Market on Thursday, said, Local variety of beans costs Rs 80 per kg, while brinjal costs Rs 60, the prices of both vegetables are steep. The prices of most of the fruits have also gone up."

Well, what else would you expect from a curry place, you ask? Well, at Coyla Cababs and Curries, Whitefield, I was pleasantly surprised, having found myself indulging in a heartwarming and the most comforting loaf of an aristocratic naan that pledges its allegiance to a royal pedigree. I got a taste of Taftan, a leavened flour bread that traces back to Persia.Coyla , Four Points by Sheraton offers Makhanwala Ghar Ka Paneer, Amritsari Pindi Chole, Sarson Ka Saag, Succulent Nalli Nihari and the traditional Kukkad Makhanwala among other desi preparations.The Paneer Tikka Angare has the fluffy cottage cheese grilled in a tandoor, leaving you with a taste of roasted spices and a moist paneer. The Jhinga Dum Nisha has the prawn coated in spices. The Gosht Chapli Cabab on their menu comes highly recommended. The meat is minced well, blended with spices employed with thorough cooking.The Makhanwala Ghar Ka Paneer has a smooth buttery tomato gravy that isnt too heavy on the spices, neither is it as oily as conventional paneer sabjis are. The Baingan Bharta too is less oily than what I am used to at home, but I guess the kitchen is adapting to the healthier lifestyle of its guests. The Kukkad Makhanwala is the traditional buttery chicken curry; the meat is well cooked and tastes of a richer version of the conventional Indian masala curry based in tomato puree.I would also like to give a shout out to the Methi Cherra Aloo on the menu. The dish is simplicity personified as deliciousnes. The chef has let the methi and aloo bring its own flavour to the dish, by keeping the spices on check. What a beauty, this was! I would highly recommend you to try this sabji if you visit Coyla. The Dal Makhani is rich and creamy.But if I havent made it more obvious yet, it was indeed the Taftan that stole my heart at this restaurant. It was light, flaky, bubbled well on the corners, soft and just served as the perfect soul food for a rainy evening. The Gulab Jamun was warm, soft and not overtly sweet, topped with pista flakes.So, if you are looking for some soothing comfort food to keep you warm on a rainy evening, head over to Coyla and order yourself some Taftan and Methi Cherra Aloo, Id say.Cost for two: Rs 1,700 (approx)"

(Source: PTI) Narendra Modi wields a broom with NDMC workers to launch Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. (Source: PTI)The neurologist, Antonio Damasio, once wrote, A brain that cant feel, cant make up its mind. Examples abound where ostensibly rationally thinking human beings with perfect information and foresight choose collectively to defy the fundamental tenet of classical economics. They tend to succumb when the dessert cart trundles by, to the great consternation of economic theorists and clairvoyants. We all break our diets.My own experience with policy and its delivery allows me to cite a few more such scenarios where pure economic policy-making crumbled at the event horizon  the policy was of little use to communities it was designed to help. As an implementer, I found programmes requiring normative behavioural change distressingly difficult to deliver, and admittedly, success was moderate.Lets take the case of Swachh Bharat, a proverbial horse and water scenario. Building toilets and creating infrastructure has not proved to be enough to make people use them. Naming and shaming has met with limited success to change preferences here. In the absence of social disincentives with everyone indulging in the same behaviour, and the practice being a collective habit perfected over the years, something more than building toilets (mostly without water supply) needs to be done here.Another of many such examples is the win-win-win incentive whorl created by our agricultural policy owing to the MSP guarantee to a limited number of crops, mainly rice and wheat. Its a winning scenario for farmers growing crops underwritten by the MSP. Fertiliser subsidies encourage more use and productivity in the short term  a win-win for both farmers and suppliers. Government procurement further fortifies overflowing FCI godowns, adding to our confidence of being sufficient in grain, adding the third win. In this system of self perpetuating incentivisation, where is the scope to wean away farmers from cereal crops towards cash crops and ensure a better agro-climatic fit?So what is that new perspective? Lets understand through a few examples again. Singapore is so spick and span, they say, you could eat out off the road. Locals file at the Tokyo metro entry and exit in perfect straight lines like automatons without a prompt, every single day of their commute. In fact, Japan is so low on public misdemeanour, more force and resources are deployed for the community service bureau than the crime bureau in the National Police Force. People behaving well save these governments billions in enforcement costs. In another example of a government harnessing normative insight, the British government called in game theorists to help design auctions for 3-G mobile telecoms operating licences in 2000, and ended up raising a cool $35.4 billion, exploiting the competitive gaming behaviour of the bidders. In short, understanding strategy requires a perspicacious look into social norms and habits, and into human behaviour guiding such norms and habits. Policy needs to be informed thus.Guided by such principles, the British government now has a full-fledged Behavioural Insights Team (BIT) also called the Nudge Unit working with the Cabinet Office. The two mantras informing all policy are: If you want to encourage someone to do something, make it easy (here is a case for simplifying tax returns), and we cant do evidence-based policy without evidence (perhaps a case for more decentralised planning tailored to local needs). Their five-year old What Works Network to encourage the government to test new ideas is already available in some manner in an indigenous avatar of the PMOs website welcoming crowdsourcing of ideas for better insights and policy design. Another stellar example to emulate is the public connect network established by the Gujarat government through BISAG (the Bhaskaracharya Institute of Space-Applications and Geo-informatics), the brainchild of our prime minister. The institute has done great work in sustainable development and inclusive growth through communication, information and direct public connect.The US too has an SBST Team (Social and Behavioural Sciences Team) in the White House, which conducts randomised controlled trials to test the effectiveness of federal policy. It has helped veterans make choices for better pension plans. It has also helped people to pay off their educational loans and also helped the IRS to increase tax compliance using simple nudges instead of hard (dis) incentives.Policy design in India thus stands to gain by being behaviourally-informed especially in the realm of policy outcomes like clean India. Working in a normative space with communities, instead of an antiseptic economic sphere, shall ensure the achievement of desired policy outcomes in the long run while minimising costs to the exchequer. This calls for the inclusion of their choices and preferences in policy and using nudges, that is continuous subtle suggestions and subliminal prompts, so that behaviours that are beneficial are reinforced and those which are damaging are extinguished.Remember, in the long run, we are all humans.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Flax seeds has been consumed as food for around 6,000 years. It could very well be the worlds first cultivated super food. Their benefits help you improve digestion, rejuvenate the skin, lower cholesterol, reduce sugar cravings, balance hormones, fight cancer and most definitely promote weight loss. Often called linseeds, they are the richest source of plant based omega-3 fatty acids, called alpha linolenic acid.There are many ways to add this super seed into ones diet. I prefer to add them into muffins, flat breads, breads and cookies. However, the best way to consume them is in its sprouted form. Soaking flax seeds and then sprouting them eliminates phytic acid and may greatly increase mineral absorption.

(Source: Reuters) K Srikanth beat Viktor Axelsen 14-21, 22-20, 21-7. (Source: Reuters)Viktor Axelsen is 63. Its an imposing 63 that maxed its advantages two months ago in beating the best of China  Chen Long and Lin Dan, as the tall Dane won the World Championships. Its also where Indian coach Pullela Gopichand watched a tad heartbreakingly as PV Sindhu  a near 6 footer  was brought down literally by Nozomi Okuhara  5 feet and a little more. The enduring image of that womens singles final was the ribbon like long slashing frame of Sindhu bent low, in clearly what is an awkward retrieving stance for the tall Indian.On Friday, it was an Indian slightly shorter than the towering Axelsen, who magnified the perils of being tall in pursuit of a dipping shuttle.Kidambi Srikanth caused mental mayhem for World Champion Viktor Axelsen in beating the Dane 14-21, 22-20, 21-7 on Friday to make the semifinals of Denmark Open. Winner of two Super Series titles this season, Srikanth had gone off the boil at the World Championships where Axelsen picked his maiden crown. But Srikanth pounced on the net often and was assured in his attacking play at Axelsenss home event, to record a major upset in front of the partisan crowd.It was Srikanths ability to cut off all that altitude on his strokes and keep the shuttle flat and low, that literally brought down the high flying Dane who has been in the form of his life these past few months. Like a kite runner, slashing off and bringing down rival kites, Srikanth killed the flight on the shuttle successfully to deny the world champ Axelsen a home semifinal.Srikanth is both intuitive in badminton and boasts of shots that can make use of his fast-processing shuttle smarts, to implement plans that his coaches sketch out. Against the long and looming Axelsen, the plan was to take the vertical advantage out of the equation.Theres nothing tall players hate more than bending low. Gopichand knows this particularly well because its the biggest challenge he faces when putting together Sindhus game. Tall players have a natural high centre of gravity that wrecks havoc with both balance and low defense. This low defense can turn nightmarish as was exploited by the 24 year old Indian against his opponent, a year younger and many inches taller.Srikanth would stub the height in the shuttle, displaying immense control in limiting the field of play to very close to (and just above) the net.So his famed attack was channelled towards keeping the shuttle as low as possible, denying Axelsen any freedom to start wheeling his long arms. Tosses and lifts were kept to a bare minimum to nip every attempt of an Axelsen smash. And as the game progressed Srikanths feet moved fast, picking the shuttle early and ensuring that it stayed low piling the discomfort of retrieving by bending and lunging on the Dane.High shots went near missing by the time Srikanth shrugged off the first set deficit and a 21-7 scoreline in the decider pointed to how effectively Srikanth had cramped Axelsen for height on a near perfect day.The 24-year-old Indian unleashed a flurry of down the line smashes deep on Axelsens forehand in overturning the first set deficit. The offense was potent in both pace and precision, but Srikanth gained confidence for what was a whiplash of a decider after some gritty retrieving of his own in the second set.It was while trailing in the opener that Srikanth had made his intent clear with some angular cross court flicks at the net. They didnt yield him immediate points as he struggled with the drift, but he was chipping away at the home contenders confident striding with some devilish deception of the wrist.Viktor  a defensive automaton helped by his massive reach, was wrong footed twice and even got himself into a tangle and landed awkwardly midway through the mid set. Srikanth, seeded 8th, would then stay in the match keeping the margins narrow snapping at the heels of the 23-year-old second seed.Coach Gopichand till then sitting for the HS Prannoy match would hop into the coachs seat soon after the opener, and guide Srikanth through what was a mental battle. Srikanth would first come up trumps in the battle of the net with his tight dribbles and then push the attack to the rear putting Viktors forehand defense to deep scrutiny. Playing the lines and upping the pace, Srikanth would expose a vulnerability and then twist the knife deeper widening the lead in the third.Axelsen fell apart under the sustained pressure and exited his home tournament, collapsing in a pile of errors. Srikanth looks good to make the Denmark finals and resume his Super Series title conquests this year. Slow to start he might ve been, but this wasnt down to him being inconsistent. Once he got a measure of the tosses and lifts in the windy stadium, and killed off both, Srikanth was right on top of the best retriever currently in world badminton.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

While many suggested to halt the train at that given spot, a few even reached to pull the chain in the train, he said. We had just left Ratnagiri railway station when the incident happened. The next halt was at Chiplun railway station, at least two hours away. After giving the required medication to a few passengers who complained of nausea, we realised nothing was going to work on them till they get the required medical care in a hospital. So, we tried our best to convince the passengers that the train needs to run till we reach a specific halt, added Nimbalkar.The father-daughter doctor duo added that they did not have their stethoscopes or other accessories with them as they were returning from a four-day holiday in Goa. By checking the pulse of ill passengers and through analysing their symptoms, Nimbalkar said, they tried to identify the problem and spread a word of caution to others. We saw the relatives of passengers were surrounding those who were ill, suffocating them further. This was followed by switching off the air-conditioner in the coach as many complained of the vomit smell that had spread across coaches. We asked them not to surround the ill passengers and allow them to breath freely, said Nimbalkar. While a few of those taken to the hospital blamed the food served in the train, which they claimed was smelly, the Nimbalkars claimed they were satisfied with the quality of food that was served to them.After the train halted at Chiplun station for two hours, we resumed the journey at 2.30 pm. I had my lunch at around 4.30 pm without having any issue with the quality of food served. Many other passengers too had their lunch, said Nimbalkar. I am not a judge to say whether there was any problem in the food. However, with a less than two minute halt at each station in this train which has automatic doors, passengers can not take a chance to step out at stations and eat. Few of them opt to carry lunch with them. Many will thus opt to eat in the train, hoping the food served is suitable to the price we pay, he added.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Forty of the 294 passengers, travelling to the city from Karmali in Goa on Sunday, were rushed to the Life Care hospital in Chiplun after the train was stopped there. Twenty-four of them had to be admitted to the hospital. But on Monday morning, all of them were discharged and transport arranged to send them to Mumbai, said railway officials.According to senior railway officials, the committee spoke to passengers, the AC mechanic, the train conductor and ticket examiners to find out the reason for the passengers throwing up as the initial suspicion was on the food served on the train. Food on Tejas not reason for passengers taking ill: RailwaysIt emerged that two groups of tourists were travelling in the affected coach, one from Himachal Pradesh and the other from Kolkata. Two children travelling with the group from Himachal Pradesh first vomited in the coach. The smell and sight caused uneasiness among the other passengers and then two more children threw up. Then two more children vomited, triggering a vomiting spree in the compartment, railway officials said.The IRCTC has served a showcause notice to catering contractor J K Ghosh. The area officer of the IRCTC at Madgaon and the onboard manager too were placed under suspension. The inquiry on them is still under way. The caterer has been supplying food in the premium train for three months.A committee comprising the senior divisional commercial manager of the CR, additional chief medical superintendent, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and additional general manager, IRCTC (Western zone), was formed to inquire into the episode. Feedback about the quality of food was taken from passengers, almost all of whom said the food served was satisfactory. Food samples were found to be within their expiry dates, said a statement from the railways.Of the 294 passengers onboard the Tejas Express, 230 were served breakfast consisting of omelette, cutlet, tea, coffee and juice at 9.30 am followed by tomato soup at 12.30 pm. Passengers reported not feeling well from 12.30 pm onwards.The railways statement quotes the tour manager of the group from Kolkata, Kajal Chakravarti, who said there was no problem with the food quality. As many as six passengers of the 16 from the group from Himachal Pradesh and six others from the group of 23 travelling from Kolkata fell ill on the train. Food poisoning could have been caused by food eaten days in advance or by bacterial infection, which can develop days later. This may have triggered the first two cases of vomiting. The uneasiness and smell caused the other passengers to throw up, said a member of the committee.It is true that food poisoning could be caused by bacterial growth after consumption of stale food over a period of days. The same is referred to as gestation and the poisoning may be triggered after consumption of other meals. However, as many as 40 passengers feeling nauseous due to the air-conditioning in the coach is something which should be checked, said Manish Deliwala, a general physician based out of Chembur.The Food and Drug Administration of Maharashtra said they were not sent any food samples from the meals served on the train for testing. The railways has not asked us for any inspection. As per protocol, they have their own food safety officer to test the food samples, said Maharashtra FDA Commissioner Pallavi Darade.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

It said two children vomited first after eating hilsa (fish) which a group of passengers had cooked and eaten before boarding the train; the rest felt nauseous due to the smell and started throwing up.But the inquiry committee hasnt completely ruled out any problem in the quality of the omelette and soup and suggested they be tested. The report says, While the actual reasons are yet to be established, it appears the cases of vomiting and uneasiness could have been triggered by one of the following reasons: (a) quality of omelette served in breakfast, (b) quality of soup served before lunch and (c) stench in the air-conditioned coach after two children vomited.Officials said the two food items were included in the probe report after some passengers complained about them. The food test lab in Dadar will check the quality of the items.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

They first shot the guard and then entered the building. They started throwing grenades and firing, said Shamshad TV reporter Faisal Zaland, who escaped through a back door.Shamshad TV, a Pashto language station that broadcasts nationwide, was transmitting a holding image instead of its normal programming.Zaland told AFP that security forces were in the area of the Shamshad compound in the Afghan capital trying to bring down the attackers. Many of my colleagues are still in the building, he added.Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid denied the militant group was involved in the attack in a Twitter post. The interior ministry told AFP that t was investigating the incident but had no further details.Kabul has been rocked by a series of deadly attacks in recent weeks as the Taliban and Islamic State insurgents step up offensives against security installations and mosques.Last Tuesday a suicide bomber, believed to have been as young as 12, struck Kabuls heavily fortified diplomatic quarter and killed at least five people, showing that militants can still hit the heart of the city despite tighter security.Security in Kabul has been ramped up since a 31 May truck bomb went off on the edge of the so-called Green Zone, killing around 150 people and wounding 400 others. Special truck scanners, barriers and permanent and mobile checkpoints have been rolled out across the city.The last major assault in Kabul was on 21 October when a suicide attacker hit a busload of Afghan army trainees, killing 15. On 20 October a suicide bomber pretending to be a worshipper blew himself up inside a Shiite mosque in the city during evening prayers, killing 56 and wounding 55.Earlier this month Kabul police stopped a lorry carrying 2,700 kilograms (nearly 6,000 pounds) of explosives hidden under boxes of tomatoes, averting a potentially deadly blast."

(Source: Reuters) A vendor sorts her tomatoes at a market outside of Harare. (Source: Reuters)Zimbabwe banned fruit and vegetable imports on Tuesday to preserve its dwindling reserves of hard currency, drawing immediate warnings of food shortages. The order, which followed a ban on maize imports in June, alarmed retailers and street dealers in the capital Harare who get much of their produce from neighbouring South Africa. The shutdown, which Agriculture Minister Joseph Made said was immediate, underlined the scale of the economic crisis in what was once one of southern Africas agricultural heartlands, in the build-up to next years national elections. Made told the Herald newspaper that veteran President Robert Mugabe had made the order himself to stop the imports because they waste much needed foreign currency.This means that the importation of fruit and vegetables will be stopped immediately. We are finalising on the exact list of foreign-produced fruits that are occupying shelves in shops, Made said. The order would let local farmers increase output, he added.The minister declined to give further details when contacted by Reuters. It cant be a blanket ban since we are not producing as much fruit and vegetables to adequately supply the local market, said the head of the Confederation of Zimbabwe Retailers, Denford Mutashu. We would need to review this.GRAPES, MANGOES, PLUMSShopper Erica Juma said she doubted Zimbabwe would be able to satisfy local demand by itself. If we can produce enough there is no problem with the ban. But I doubt we are able to, Juma said, while picking up South African grapes in Pick n Pay supermarket for her lunch in central Harare.At a busy road intersection, street hawker Sam Nyandima said the ban would hit his supplies. We survive on selling fruits to motorists. If they go ahead with this ban it will badly affect our livelihoods, he said, as he sold pawpaw, mangoes and plums in the blazing sun.The country dumped its currency for the US dollar in 2009 because it was wrecked by hyperinflation but it is now running short of dollars as well as quasi-currency bond note introduced last year to ease cash shortages.Zimbabwes latest currency crisis is blamed on low export earnings, increased government domestic borrowing that has increased money supply not matched by dollar inflows and high govermnment spending, 90 percent which goes to salaries.Commercial agriculture has not recovered from the hit it took after 2000 from Mugabes seizures of land from white farmers. Last year Zimbabwe spent more than $80 million on fruit and vegetables imports, according to national statistics agency Zimstat.Many Zimbabweans keep stashes of USdollars at home, or resort to buying hard currency on the black market when they want to travel or pay for imports.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

5a155b8c9855b76bf13ed94f,Eating Bengal,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1171001/jsp/opinion/story_175573.jsp,2017-10-01,,Telegraph,"For the non-Bengali like me, Puja tourism is about food. In the early Nineties, when I first began visiting pandals in Chittaranjan Park, I was baffled by the non-doing nature of the main enclosure that hosted the pratima. We seemed always to get there before or after the aarti so to the uninitiated outsider, the setting felt like a prelude to something that never happened. The first time the pandal and the pratima made sense to me as performance was years later while watching the film, Parineeta, when I saw a particularly energetic version of the dhunuchi dance. Except that the principal dancer was Sanjay Dutt and while I'm used to suspending disbelief at the pictures, it was hard to take in Munna Bhai in this new bhadralok avatar without giggling. I think one of the reasons people inspect the pratima so closely is that for the most part, there's so little else to do. I used to pay particular attention to the slain (or in the process of being slain) Mahishasura for the same reason that people watch action movies: for the gore. The first year that I toured the pandals, the Mahishasuras were small, pitiable figures, notable mainly for the bloody wound that Durga's trident had made, but I later encountered large, heavily muscled versions. What they had in common was a haplessness that was oddly moving. Durga herself seemed oblivious to the asura she had killed, as she looked into the middle distance, remotely smiling. It was her lion that seemed properly involved in the slaughter, his bloodied teeth and claws dug into Mahishasura's body which was often a bilious green and who can blame him? The saddest figure in the composition was the discarded buffalo, supine and hollowed out at the base of the tableau, like a filmi extra. My disenchantment with the tableaux had something to do with the fact that the first one I saw had Durga as a dead ringer for Hema Malini. The prig in me was offended: I had come looking for Bengali iconography and had found a still from a Bombay mythological instead. Looking back, though, I can see the point of the likeness: if the artist had been looking to model beatific blandness, he couldn't have done better. It was in the food stalls that I found consolation, in the deep fried, keema-stuffed porotas made out of maida. As someone born and raised in Delhi on first-rate Punjabi parathas, after that first taste of the Bengali version, I couldn't understand why north Indians bothered with aata when maida's elastic chewiness was self-evidently better. The same principle holds for pooris; why not, in a frank, manly way acknowledge superiority and eat luchis instead? The first time I encountered festive Bengali food was in 1983 when I travelled up to Calcutta for a friend's wedding. We stayed with the groom in his parents' house for several days and on the first day we settled down to eat lunch at a very long table flanked by benches. It was a catered meal and I still remember the name of the caterer: Bijoli Grill. We were served rice and dal and mashed potatoes which, in retrospect, I recognize as alu makha but at the time I thought was a kind of alu bharta. The dal was excellent and the sharpness of the mustard oil mixed into the potatoes was a new and adventurous taste. As someone who had been raised a vegetarian before going over to the dark side, I understood dal, chawal and alu and I made a meal of it. I was a little surprised at the plainness of the food, but it was barely noon so I decided it was meant to be a kind of brunch and there were after all, dozens of people to be fed. After stuffing myself, I made to get up and leave. This was awkward because I was sitting on a running bench so the thin young man to my right had to get up as well to make space for me to lever my legs out from under the table. I was midway through this manoeuvre when Mrs Sarkar, Abhijit's mother, materialized in front of me looking concerned. ""Where are you going?"" she asked. ""Is there something wrong with the food?"" I said it was wonderful but I had eaten enough. ""Enough?"" she repeated, baffled. ""But we have just begun!"" I had never eaten a desi meal in courses before. Where I came from you ate your staple - dal, roti, paratha - surrounded by the sabzis and chutneys and raitas and pickles that constituted the meal. An amused Hyderabadi friend once described this to me as 'your katori culture'. So when I was nudged back into my place on the bench, I realized that the wedding guest in Bengal needed to be a long-distance runner. After that initial course, we ate two kinds of fish, rui and ilish. This was followed by a mutton curry which I know now was kosha mangsho. All of this was accompanied by several servings of rice. After we had done with the meat, we moved on to chatni, a tomato chutney mined with dates, raisins and other sweetness that I wasn't sure I liked till I combined it with rice and then it was magical. I was feeling faintly sick by then because I had never eaten so much before and I hadn't paced myself. This was around the time that I began to attend to the thin young man to my right. He was extraordinarily thin, in that hipless, hollow-cheeked way that's special to India. He was virtually two-dimensional. And yet, he made his way through the rui, ilish and mangsho like a human tapeworm, helping himself more than once to each sort of fish and then the mutton and now he was doing a steady free-style through the chatni, never pausing to breathe or burp. We finished with three kinds of mishti; I use 'we' loosely, because I had fallen by the wayside by then. My participation was vicarious; I just watched my neighbour do the treble with ease, this Abebe Bikila of the six-course meal. We ate like this every day, twice a day, for three days. But this, I was assured, was nothing; the pice de rsistance according to the gourmands who surrounded me, was yet to come. These were the king prawns that would be served at the bou bhaat, the reception dinner the day after the wedding. I never got that far; I only ever heard Abhijit's king prawns described because by the evening of the wedding reception, I was a broken man, running a shuttle service to the nearest loo, my digestion destroyed by a regimen of gluttony that asked for more endurance than my north Indian constitution could supply. There is a reason why Abhijit, like many Bengali men, always carries a little pink bottle of Gelusil or its alternative, the orange Aqua Ptychotis. No culture can eat like this without chronic heartburn. But eating was never the same again after that 1983 wedding. I learnt to eat my way through fish heads as they squinted at me, to tease hair-thin bones out of ilish, to lay by enough room for the sweet at the end. When my niece declared the other day that she was going pandal-hopping with friends, I told her to skip the pratimas and home in on the porotas. She was kind enough to report that I was right. It's a simple truth that I learnt three-and-a-half decades ago: Bengali culture is basically food."

I just want the truth to come out.""Mr Banerjee has to report for questioning again tomorrow.He was accused by the woman, a resident of north Bengal, of promising to marry her, cohabiting with her and then dumping her. Her police complaint, filed on October 10, alleges rape. Earlier, she had filed a police complaint at her hometown, Balurghat, and then gone public with intimate photos of the two of them and tweeted to India's vice president, the minister of women welfare and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for help.Mr Banerjee had, however, filed a police complaint on September 6, stating that he had merely tried to help the woman get a student loan and she had tried to blackmail him. He filed an FIR on October 9, a day before she did.In September, just before the case hit the headlines, Mr Banerjee was expelled by his party, the CPM, for a variety of 'personal indiscretions'. His party suspended him in June after it received 19 complaints about alleged ""sexual misconduct"".After the woman's FIR, the CID, given charge of the case, summoned Mr Banerjee twice but he failed to show up. Finally, with the threat of arrest looming over his head, he sought and got anticipatory bail and reported to the police today.The woman is not backing off. Her Twitter status reads, ""Ritabrata is a rapist, womanizer, liar and full of s***. Next time you see him, throw rotten eggs n tomato at him.""Such public exchanges about personal indiscretions are unusual in India, certainly in Indian politics. Though he has been expelled by his party, Mr Banerjee is still a member of the Indian parliament. His term as an 'Independent' ends in 2020."

We are, therefore, purchasing only 50% of what we used to earlier.Many vegetables to Puducherry are transported from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. We get onions, capsicum, brinjal, ladies finger from Chikkaballapur and Bengaluru and tomatoes and cucumber from Andhra Pradesh. We were buying five loads of onions from Bengaluru. It has now reduced to three, he said.Ms. Devi states that the other major reason for the hike in prices was the drastic fall in the vegetable farming in Puducherry. Thengaithittu, Ariyankuppam and many villages surrounding Puducherry were known for their vegetable farming. Ladies finger, greens, brinjal, pumpkins were grown locally. With the conversion of agricultural land to residential plots, the production has fallen. Now, we have to depend on other states for vegetables, she says."

A platter of tapas  Spanish finger-food  arrived, with pulled chicken, mustard and scallion herb fish, garlic prawn crostini, caprese, marinated olives, pickled gherkins and fried chillies (Rs. 695).The first dish to arrive was a prawn preparation  gambas al ajillo  prawns sizzled with garlic, chilli, parsley, olive oil and lemon (Rs. 425). Then came the pollo al ajillo  pan-seared garlic chicken thigh, sausages and wings (Rs. 375). And then there was coca-Catalan flatbread  oven-roasted vegetables, roasted tomatoes and fresh herbs (Rs. 325).The tapas were good, and I enjoyed the pulled chicken, the caprese  a piece of soft mozzarella and tomato stick  and the garlic prawn crostini served on a piece of small flat bread.The platter included some basa fish, which I politely refused. Basa, in my opinion, is the fish worlds paneer.The main prawn dish was served on a small slice of lemon, which gave it a nice tangy taste. The main flavours for the chicken and prawn dishes were similar, except that the chicken was chilli-hot. I enjoyed both.I liked the Catalan flatbread quite a bit. One, of course, because of the developments in Catalonia, and, two, because it was a crispy thin-crust bread with some delicious roasted toppings.It is almost like a pizza, but without the mandatory tomato sauce. It came with yellow and red roasted peppers, broccoli, zucchini, aubergines and tomatoes. The veggies were juicy, the bread was crisp, and the two complementary textures jived well together. And what added to the taste was the basil, which left its characteristically piquant flavours on the toppings of the flatbread.It was quite a nice meal, and since I was in The Beer Caf, I had some Belgian beer to go along with the food.However, since the caf has a vast wine collection, I think they should tone down their spices so that the food can complement the wine, and vice versa.But the menu is interesting, the place is comfortable and the food, enjoyable. Muy buen, Id say."

Part of a group of seven inmates who received their licence, Rupa also appeared for her Class 10 equivalency examination the day before her release. She was also very active in other activities in which the inmates are trained. Once Rupa eases back into her life outside the prison walls, she can use her driving skills to earn a living and stay away from crime, hopes jail superintendent O.V. Valli.The Attakulangara jail has space to accommodate 107 women inmates, but currently has only 60. As a correctional facility, it has been training inmates in various skills to provide them an opportunity to turn their life around when they walk out of here.The food unit at the jail, for instance, churns out nearly 40 products made by three inmates. These include cakes, sweets, munchies, instant snacks, and pickle. For the inmates here, the day starts early  at 2 a.m. By 6 a.m., idli and sambar cooked using traditional idli thattu are ready. The inmates are paid Rs. 48 in wages for their work.Artistic talentWelfare Officer Rekha P. Nair is in charge of the sari design and nettipattam (ornamental caparisons) unit.The sari design unit began by screen printing on Kerala saris, and then moved on to cotton colour saris in December last. The prisoners also make nettipattams and thidambu in various sizes. Some of the inmates are very talented, and their artistic skills and eye for colour are reflected in the products they make, Ms. Rekha Nair says. Owing to the low cost of production, these are available at cheaper rates than those in the market. The sales too are good, she adds.The jails garden boasts of muringa, papaya, plantain, ginger, colocasia, long-podded cowpea, yam, chillies, tomato, brinjal and mushroom cultivation, all tended to by the prisoners. With 700 recently arrived growbags, the cultivation has been expanded further. We believe the veggies here grow especially well because of the care and attention provided by the inmates, the officials say.A teacher trains the inmates in cutting and stitching. The unit has 11 sewing machines. Six prisoners here transform running material into salwar sets, tops, nighties, and underskirts, for sale at the jail and the Free Fashionista counter at the Central Prison. There is also a soap and lotion unit, umbrella unit, and a paper bag unit. Some inmates use the time inside to complete their Class 4 and 7 equivalency courses of the Kerala State Literacy Mission Authority under the supervision of a teacher, while others study even further, the officials say.Joy of readingThe jail has an extensive library with over 6,500 books, and many an inmate is a voracious reader. An FM radio and a television are other sources of entertainment. Not only do the activities keep the inmates occupied, it is often what keeps them looking ahead during their days here.Inmates who are used to keeping busy come asking for work, the officials say. Once an initial batch is trained in some skill, they train a few others too.However, because there are very few inmates who are here for long periods, training remains an ongoing process. Ms. Valli says there are many who have used their skills to earn a steady income once they are released.B. Pradeep, Deputy Inspector General of Prisons (South Zone) and Director, State Institute of Correctional Administration (Thiruvananthapuram), says driving and handicraft making were two good initiatives launched recently for prisoners. Some of them are very creative, and we are trying to help them hone their skills so that they can look forward to a self-reliant life once they return to the world out there, he says.Some of the inmates are very talented, and their artistic skills and eye for colour are reflected in the products they make.Rekha P.

5a1579309855b76bf13ee537,Bhog for Pujo: It's time to dine with the goddess!,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bhog-for-pujo-its-time-to-dine-with-the-goddess/articleshow/60871765.cms,2017-09-29,,The Times Of India,"'Head to Congress Bhavan. They have the best chingri maach. Also, the kosha mangsho at Bhosale Nagar is to die for!'During Pujo, besides festive pleasantries, we can bet that the next most important topic of discussion among Bengalis is what one can eat and where - such is their love for food! Be that as it may, the real charm, however, lies in the simple 'bhog' (an offering to Ma Durga) served during the festival.Close to lunch hours, it's common to see people partaking in the meal on sal leaf or dona plates as dada-boudis and elderly kaku-kakimas attend to them. An honest celebration of community, we couldn't think someone better than 68-year-old Moni Das to tell us more about this divine meal.We meet Moni, the head cook of Pune Kali Bari (one of the city's oldest pujas), in a makeshift mandap beside the pandal. Sporting a checked gamccha, he oversees his team that readies the day's bhog . They stir enormous steel patilas of food, as myriad aromas arise and engulf us. ""We've been cooking since 5 am,"" he tells us. While Moni captains the ship, he has 15 men assisting him, and an additional 10 men packing food parcels for visitors who won't be eating at Pune Kali Bari.Having used over 40 kilos of paneer, 40 kilos of peas, 50 kilos of potatoes, 200 kilos of rice and about 200 litres of milk, Moni assures us that the food will be more than sufficient. ""10 people can have a kilo of bhog'er khichuri. Going by that estimation, we cook according to the day and its expected footfall. Ashtami and Navami see maximum attendance. That's when we cook for 3000-plus people,"" Moni adds. Clearly, catering for so many has become second nature for him, given that he has been cooking for Pune Kali Bari since 1979.The quintessential meal is a simple one, merely representing a lavish Bengali meal for everyone to partake in. Moni tells us that the line-up usually comprises, but isn't restricted to, flavoursome bhog'er khichuri (prepared from special Gobindobhog rice, moong dal and vegetables; except onions and garlic), labra (Bengali-style mixed vegetable), a sweet-tangy date and tomato chutney, beguni (a fried brinjal savoury) followed by payesh (rich Bengali rice kheer). On Saptami, Pune Kali Bari served devotees a Bengali-style pulao, chana dal, aloo-mattar-paneer, chutney and payesh. Today's menu will be the aforementioned standard one.Moni says, ""Panch phoron (five-spice masala) is most important for preparing khichuri, labra and chutney. If it is prepared here, the flavours don't match up to what you get in Bengal. Hence we source the masala and Gobindobhog rice from Kolkata."" Another key element is the bhaja masala gudi (dry-roasted and ground masala) that's added to the khichuri along with ghee before serving.Besides Durga Puja, Moni is busy during other pujas at Pune Kali Bari, namely amavasya puja, Annapurna puja, Saraswati Puja, Laxmi Puja and Kali Puja, to name some. Besides seeking Durga's blessings, he is also reason why many love visiting  to tuck into the familiar, homely meal they look forward to. Rest assured, when you visit today, the taste and flavour will be just like what you relished last year.According to consulting Indologist Urmi Chanda-Vaz , socially, Durga Puja in its present form was started in the early 16th century by Bengal's rajas and zamindars. ""They instituted the festival in their palatial homes as a show of authority or autonomy against the British. Gradually, it became an opportunity to flaunt wealth and social status. They would organise grand feasts and committed acts of charity. The grander the feast, the more the social prestige,"" she says.But the gastronomic excesses are also justified with an emotional narrative. Rina Pradhan, a member of Anandam Association, explains, ""We liken Ma Durga's visit to the arrival of a married daughter to her parent's house. Her spending these five days with us brings immense happiness. She is thus pampered with the most delectable traditional food in the form of bhog."" According to Urmi, the offerings in West Bengal are mostly vegetarian, but the East of Bengal (now Bangladesh) offer the goddess non-vegetarian fare, including meat and fish.'Bhog' means an offering to the goddess. Once she has ritually 'eaten' it, it becomes prasad. And it is this prasad that people eat. It's a misnomer when people say they are going to eat bhog.

Balakrishna, employee of a private organisation, was surprised to see the empty beverages counter during the intermission of a cinema at a multiplex a couple of days ago. With limited options available at the counter, all he could get is an overflowing tub of tomato-chilli popcorn for Rs. 250 before settling down to watch the rest of the film.The experience of watching movies in swanky and ritzy world of multiplexes comes at a price even for those who enter the cinema halls with loaded wallets. A small family of three members is sure to shell out Rs. 4,000-Rs. 5,000 for entertainment in a multiplex cinema hall a month.Every time, I end up emptying my wallet paying dearly for a range of snacks served at the counters as my wife and daughter cannot do without indulging in munchies and refreshments, said K. Ganababu, who works in a private hospital. However, what came as a relief to movie-goers is that they can now get refreshments at maximum retail price as Collector Pravin Kumar directed multiplexes not to charge them above theMRP.The well-stocked racks at the counters now wear a empty look as the multiplexes have stopped selling water bottles, popular beverages and packaged food stuff sourced from select channels. Products procured from select channels have been returned to the respective dealers and fresh stocks are yet to arrive from the makers, said a multiplex theatre manager.Cine-goers heave a sigh of relief as they can now settle for some edible stuff at an affordable price in the multiplexes. Asked whether the drop in price is also applicable to pizzas, samosas and sandwiches available at the counters, a multiplex theatre manager said there was no clarity on rates of such snacks.According to divisional vice-chairman of National Consumer Rights Commission M. Vyas Goud, the order was issued following constant representations by people who expressed their concern over dual pricing of snacks and beverages at the multiplex theatres.Assistant Controller of Department of Legal Metrology P. Sudhakar asked consumers to be aware of their rights and report to the authorities if they come across any deviation in rules on MRP."
5a1598079855b76bf13eeddf,Are vertical farms the way forward for Bengaluru?,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/are-vertical-farms-the-way-forward-for-bengaluru/articleshow/60982425.cms,2017-10-08,,The Times Of India,"Pollution and space restraints  something that Bengalureans tackle every single day. Scarcity of water and erratic climate changes have become unfortunate realities, but we still carry on leading our lives in traditional ways that were meant for a plentiful world. It is said that by 2050, there will be well over nine billion people in the world, and 70% of them will live in urban areas. As a result, there is bound to be food shortage and food security issues. This is why 23-year-old Rutusha Nagaraj Kapini , a fresh graduate of The Oxford School of Architecture , picked vertical farming as the topic for her thesis, which, she says, is the way forward in an urban metropolis like Bengaluru. And such was her research into the topic that she received two awards for it  Zonal Winner, Council of Architecture National Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Architectural Thesis 2017 (top 10 in Zone 4) and Archi Design Best Thesis of the Year Award 2016 (Student of the Year Award  national level).For her thesis, Rutusha had to find an innovative solution to the following problem: 'Increasing population has drastically reduced farming lands. Raw food, such as vegetables and fruits, are loaded with toxic chemicals and pesticides'. Having attended the All India Convention of Architects in 2008 (both her parents are architects), Rutusha was inspired by Dr Dickson Despommier 's speech  he is considered the father of vertical farming. ""He spoke about how vertical farming can be beneficial in urban populated cities in India, as it can produce nutritious food that one can access within the city. He is the reason I picked this topic,"" she says.So, what did Rutusha discover through research for her thesis? She found that vertical farming could be an innovative model through architectural design intervention, which minimizes land usage, while still feeding the population. The environmentally-conscious and ecological design is conceived as a network of facilities, with training centres for farmers, and creating bioclimatic buildings of the future  Verti Farms. Throwing more light on the topic, Rutusha says, ""Bioclimatic buildings are those that respond to climate; verti farms are inside these buildings. The buildings create an artificial environment within them and are not completely dependent on natural resources. So, design plays a big role. For e.g., they will have solar tubes through which natural sunlight enters the building. There will also be LED light farming (certain LED lights help plants grow). Each of the planters will be placed on rotational carousels within the building. There will be mirrors on the walls that will reflect the natural sunlight (the buildings will not be completely closed and the openings will be protected with stainless-steel meshes). The carousels will be placed in stacked heights; there will be one water inlet source, and since the platforms rotate, the water will be drained out at a single drain pipe, which will lead to the central service core that will be connected to a sewerage treatment plant."" Through this method, she adds, only 5% of water is required for five times the yield. Also, changes in weather will not affect the crops much as the environment within the building is controlled.To get a better idea of how verti farms work, Rutusha went to Singapore for a live study of the Sky Greens there. Having done sufficient research, she has identified a vacant plot of land near Lalbagh that can be put to productive use by setting up India's first vertical farm there. ""The government already has HOPCOMS set up in many places; similarly, they could allot land to verti farms. These can serve as interactive spaces for the public, which would encourage them to adapt it on smaller scales, such as at apartment complexes and private layouts. It can even serve as local marketplaces, where the produce is sold fresh,"" says Rutusha. But wouldn't this harm the income of farmers? ""No,"" says Rutusha, explaining, ""Farmers will be required to work on verti farms. Each building will have training centres for the farmers  it will be a free course. Crops often fail due to erratic climate changes, but verti farms reduce that risk, since they are not completely dependent on natural forces. So, farmers will actually be able to generate a steady income.""What is interesting is that verti farms cater to city-specific needs. This reflects in the plants that can be grown in them  fruits and vegetables that we use for daily consumption. This includes tomato, peas, brinjal, curry leaves, basil, lettuce, mint, cauliflower, spring onions, okra, cucumber, lemons and broccoli, among others.The organic building that Rutusha has proposed will be expensive initially, but, she says, costs will breakeven after five years, after which it will be profitable. ""A 10-acre site in Lalbagh can accommodate two high-rise verti farms. On the same land, I have proposed the setting up of training and research centres, a local market and an interactive space. All this can be built at an estimated cost of Rs 200 crore,"" says Rutusha.The young architect wants to continue research on the subject through a Master programme, apart from creating a startup to convert her thesis into a viable business model. If her efforts come to fruition, Bengaluru could very well be home to India's first vertical farm."

Under the scheme, Rs 8,000 per acre will be directly credited to bank accounts of farmers who have grown tomato crops. Officials will inspect farms 45 days after tomato seeds are sown, following which the amount will be credited to farmers' accounts.Tomatoes are currently being sold at Rs 50-80 per kilo in Gurgaon and other NCR cities. Seeds for the crop are sown in January and February, and the fruits are ready for harvest by April-May. The agriculture department has set a target of 400 hectares to grow tomatoes in the coming season.On Wednesday, Abhilaksh Likhi, principal secretary to the agriculture department, said a monthly plan should be prepared for the new scheme, and soil testing done at the earliest. ""We've set a target to collect and check 12,707 soil samples in Gurgaon by year-end.

Picture by Prashant Mitra Inundation of several roads and bridges is threatening to snap the supply of essential commodities, including fruits and vegetables, to Ranchi and jack up prices in the wholesale and retail markets. Sources in the transport circuit said a bridge over Koel river in Basia, Gumla, went underwater on Wednesday, leaving 100trucks bound for the capital stranded at various locations. Similarly, rainwater flowing over a bridge near Bero in Mandar block has halted the supply of essentials coming from Lohardaga and Daltonganj (Palamau). ""The Ranchi-Simdega road, which extends till Odisha, is out of bounds for traffic since the Koel bridge was inundated. We have suspended all buses (around 30) to Simdega and beyond. At least 100trucks bringing supplies from different states are stranded,"" said Kishore Mantri, the general secretary of Ranchi Bus Owners' Association. Mantri added that vehicular movements on Ranchi-Lohardaga and Ranchi-Daltonganj routes were as badly hit. Suresh Kumar, who drives a bus on Ranchi-Daltonganj stretch, said a portion of a small bridge near Pakhria in Chanho on NH-75 was witnessing erosion. ""Portions of the bridge have become very narrow, leading to long snarls. More rain can snap this link too,"" he said. On Ranchi-Hazaribagh-Patna route (NH-33), a landslide threat has emerged near Chuttupalu valley in Ramgarh after heavy rain loosened boulders. The Ranchi-Bokaro road via Sikidiri and Ranchi-Silli road are also out of bounds owing to flooding of a bridge and road cave-in in Silli two days ago. Sunil Chauhan, vice-president of Ranchi Goods Transporters Association, said consignments from Bengal had remained affected for two-three days. ""Potatoes, vegetables and flowers come from Bengal and other states to Ranchi via Baharagora, and this link has taken a beating. Vegetable prices are likely to rise,"" Chauhan said, adding that roughly 100 trucks brought essential items to Ranchi and more than 50 were stranded. A senior official of a retail supermarket chain said for three days now, they were facing crisis of vegetables. ""Our stocks come from Silli and Gola, but many roads and bridges have been washed away along the route, and there is no supply. In Brambe (on Ranchi's outskirts), where we do bulk procurement, local markets are closed owing to incessant rain. We are somehow managing with vegetables bought from Pithoria,"" he said, adding that almost all their outlets in Ranchi and Jamshedpur were facing the crunch. ""For our 50-odd stores in Ranchi and Jamshedpur, we require 10 tonnes of vegetables a day, but are doing with less than half the stocks."" The humble potato will soon be too hot to handle, the supermarket official warned. ""Potatoes mostly come from Bengal. As per norms, they are first dried after being taken out of cold storage before being dispatched. Heavy rain in Bengal has hit stocks,"" he said. In retail markets, the price of tomato has shot up to Rs 120 notwithstanding the state food and civil supplies department's order to FJCCI to cap the rate at Rs 80. Green vegetables like beans and cauliflower are acting pricey too. Beans are selling at Rs 30 per 250gm while a small cauliflower also has a price tag of Rs 30.

What is a garden without insects ? Its like life without problems! The most common insects that can create havoc are mealy bugs, aphids and spider mites.Leaf Miner: These minute insects form lines on the leaves. They usually dont harm the plant much, but its advisable to discard the leaves, else they can affect the whole plant.Mealy bugsThese are soft cottony looking insectsAphidsThese are tiny dark coloured insects.Aphids and mealy bugs can spread very quickly if not detected at an early stage. They are sap sucking insects and are mostly found on the stem and branches and at the back side of the leaves.Spider mitesAre extremely tiny insects and usually found on the underside of the leaves. They form web like structure and make holes through the leaf.Some common remedies are described belowAlthough organic pesticides are tempting, water jet spray and wiping with hand is a better option to clean off the insects from the plant. A jet spray from the watering hose pipe is very effective compared to spraying from a bottle. Give the affected part of the plant a complete wash. Wait for a few days and see if they come back. Give a second wash if necessary. Following are some alternative options in case the pests returns:Neem oil : Add 20 ml of neem oil and 5 drops of liquid handwash to 1 litre of water. Mix it well and spray generously all over the affected parts of the plant. The liquid handwash helps the neem oil to stick on the plants and protect it.3G formula : Grind 100g each of ginger, green chillies and garlic to paste. Take 5 ml of this paste and mix with one litre water and spray. Use once in 10 days.Wood Ash : Sprinkle wood ash on the plant, preferably from wood that has not been chemically treated. You can also sprinkle homa ash on the affected leave and around the top soil of the pot.Once you have an attack of aphids and luck shines upon you, a very friendly visitor, the ladybug or lady beetle may appear to feast on these aphids. Other insects / reptiles such as lizards and grasshoppers also help in controlling the pest population in a garden.Another indicator of an aphid infection is the presence of ants on the plant. Ants do not directly harm the plants, but they help spreading and protecting the mealybugs and the aphids. The mealybugs and aphids take off nutrition from the plants and the ants then feed on them. So once you see ants on your plants, there is a good chance that there is something buggy going on. Most of these insects will be on the back side of the leaves, so it is difficult to spot them.Some gardeners spray the neem oil mix (as mentioned above) on a regular basis. But this is usually not a good option since it works like taking a paracetamol in advance to prevent from falling sick. Instead , it is suggested to spend time on making the soil rich enough that it has good amount of nutrition to keep the plant healthy and be able to fight pests.Just like humans and animals fall sick, so do plants. This usually happens when plants are weak due to lack of nutrition or care. Providing nutrition on a regular basis helps the plant growth. For example, a tomato plant takes about 1.5 months to start flowering. Till this point of time, the nutrition present in the initial potting mix is used up. The plant needs more nutrition during the flowering and fruiting period. So starting from the flowering stage, provide additional nutrition to the plant. Some methods of enriching the soil are below:Leaf MinerThese minute insects form lines on the leaves. They usually dont harm the plant much, but its advisable to discard the leaves, else they can affect the whole plant.Stem/shoot/fruit borerThese insects basically lay their eggs in the stem or the fruit of the plant. As the caterpillar develops, it destroys the fruit/stem. Most commonly seen on gourds and brinjals. Phermone traps can be used to trap these insects.Different types of CompostRemove approx 1 inch of the top layer of the soil and 1-2 handfuls of compost and cover with the soil again. General recommendation is to do this once in 2 weeks. Make sure that you do not disturb the root structure.Liquid fertilisers like Panchgavya (PG) and Jeeva Amrut (JA) help in quick nutrient absorption from the soil. PG and JA are usually available with folks who have cows (preferably desi cows) in their farms. Making them is a rather long process and the ingredients are not easily available for an average urban gardener. Hence they usually prefer to buy these instead of making them on their own.TIPWhen opening the PG bottle for the first time, make sure you direct the opening away from you and slowly twist open the cap in an open place. Else it may fizz out like a cola drink! For first timers, PG smells can be intimidating.Jeevamruta (JA)is similar to PG, but with lesser ingredients viz, cow urine, cow dung, jaggery, besan (bengal gram) powder and untouched top soil. The microbial activity n JA is at it peak around the 3rd/4th day of preparation. Check with supplier for when to use & dilution details.Panchgavya (PG) : is made out of five ingredients and hence its name  cow dung, cow urine, cow milk, ghee and curd. Bananas and jaggery are also added. To use PG, one needs to dilute 20-30 ml of PG into 1 liter of water and water the plants with this diluted mix. There might be slight variation in how PG is prepared, so check with the supplier about dilution details and its life. On an average, one can use it once in a month."

Their bright plumage fanned out regally, they strut about without the fear of being trapped or killed. The area has turned into a safe haven for the national bird and perhaps has the largest concentration of these birds at one place in the state. ""Though a scientific survey of the birds has never been conducted, but ocular estimates put their number around 1,500,"" said Ghumsar south divisional forest officer Bijay Ketan Acharya. With the forest officials and the local peacock protection committee, a volunteers' body, taking care to ensure that peacocks are not harmed in any way, the birds feel completely secure at Pakidi, a protected forest area spread over 480 hectares. The birds frequently descend from the hill and roam about at the periphery villages feeding on leftover food and drinking water from the artificial tanks constructed by the committee. ""So far, we have not come across any case of intentional killing of these birds. People residing at 20 villages around the hill love peacocks and will not harm them,"" said Acharya. At Chermaria, one of these villages, located about 8km from Aska town, the forest department has set up an eco cottage, where tourists can stay and enjoy the scenic beauty of the hill and the surrounding. Local peacock protection committee president Samir Pradhan said the forest department co-operated with them in protecting the peacocks. ""The birds love ripe tomatoes and red chillies, which are found in abundance at our villages. Sometimes we have to protect the crops from them, but no one ever harms the birds. We also keep pots filled with water for the peacocks to slake their thirst,"" Pradhan said. However in 2011, 10 peacocks had died at Pakidi after feeding on cotton fields sprinkled with pesticides. The issue had led to a confrontation between the forest and agriculture departments with both pointing accusing fingers at each other. ""However, things have been fine since then. The birds are perfectly safe at Pakidi,"" Acharya said."

Visitors kept away from the market which was inundated by Monday's rainfall.Traders blamed the water stagnation on the failure of the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) to clear the path for rainwater to drain into the Cooum river. Rainwater from the market complex drains into the Cooum through a channel near Daniel Thomas Matriculation School on Poonamallee High Road ""Despite repeated requests, CMDA refused to clear the water channel. Even worse, about four acres of land near the school has been bought by a restaurant chain which has blocked the area. If the restaurant is allowed to come up, it will permanently seal the channel,"" said advisor to the Koyambedu Vegetable Market Wholesale Traders Association, V R Soundararjan. ""Footfall reduces every monsoon due to poor maintenance of the market complex. Authorities must ensure that traders dump vegetable waste only in bins. Fogging must be carried out regularly to control mosquito breeding in the market complex,"" he said.Traders said prices of vegetables have gone up due to heavy rainfall that damaged crops in Karnataka and western Tamil Nadu . Only the price of potato, which costs Rs 15-18 per kilogram, has remained stable since the last few weeks. The price of tomato rose from Rs 20/kg to Rs 40/kg while that of beans has gone up from Rs 30/kg to Rs 50/kg. Carrot, which was sold for Rs 30 two weeks ago, is now being sold for Rs 50/kg.

Some of the specialties are seasonal, but the rule doesnt apply to all seasonal produce. The mango sandwich, for instance, is available round the year. They also serve toasted sandwiches with a simple filling of tomatoes and cucumber.The area where the Jain Coffee House is located has a colourful history. It was a red-light district during the Mughal era. Serious-minded city explorers, however, visit the area to photograph crumbling old balconies and try delicious streetside, vegetarian-only snacks such as aloo tikkis, gol-gappas and bedmi puri.If you dont have a taste for fruit sandwiches, you might like the savoury namkeen sandwich layered with paneer, tomato slices, pomegranate seeds, and flavoured with coriander leaves and light spices.The dimly lit coffee house is owned by a family of grain merchants from north Delhis Kanhaiya Nagar. A few assistants spend the day placing sliced tomatoes on slices of white bread. Its founder, Lala Shambhu Dayal Jain, had migrated to the city from Shikarpur in western Uttar Pradesh.The coffee house also serves fruit shakes.

For representation purposeA miniature toy, kept in a snack pack to lure children into buying the packet, turned out to be fatal for a four-year-old boy who mistakenly swallowed it in Eluru town of Andhra Pradesh's West Godavari district.Meesala Nireekshan, who unsuspectingly chewed and swallowed the plastic toy along with tomato rings in the packet at his home in Eluru last evening, choked to death, a police official said on Thursday.The tiny toy was stuffed inside the snack pack and, after a few bites of the tomato rings, the boy consumed it as well mistaking it for an eatable, he said.""He then started vomiting and froth oozed out of his mouth when his mother saw him. Stuck in the throat, the toy caused the boy to choke as the efforts to pull it out failed,"" the official said.The boy was immediately rushed to the government hospital where he was declared brought dead, he said.The boy's parents later filed a police complaint with the Two Town Police against the snack manufacturer, he said.A case under relevant sections pertaining to unnatural death was registered in connection with the incident, the official said."

Indeed, in the case of movies like Darren Aronofskys mother! and  Ill never forget this  2007 Best Picture Oscar-winner No Country for Old Men, that wait never ended.But another thing happens in the weeks you spend in anticipation of a new film: You read about it online. Theres no avoiding it. Tweets, hourly updates on Rotten Tomatoes scores, tweets about hourly updates on Rotten Tomatoes scores; they hound you like injustice hounds Hercule Poirot. So while Ive successfully managed to stick to my rule of not reading professional reviews before having seen the film, I could not avoid some of the more colourful headlines.While most of them were evidently quite pleased with Kenneth Branaghs film, one of the recurring observations however, was that he didnt seem to have introduced enough new ideas to justify another adaptation of Agatha Christies celebrated novel. After all, they pointed out, Sidney Lumets 1974 adaptation is still held in the highest regard.Having finally seen the new Murder on the Orient Express  eagerly, hungrily, as a lifelong fan  I cannot disagree more. Not only has Branagh retained the old-world charm and the exotic romanticism of Christies novels, he has found dimensions to the Dames stories that I  despite having read all her books to the point that they were under physical threat of disintegration  had never expected, and honestly, never even thought of.And Branagh begins his deviation from tradition from the first scene of the Murder on the Orient Express, in which he establishes a new sort of Hercule Poirot. We already know of his famous moustaches and his legendary grey cells (he never shuts up about them, does he?), but have we ever wondered (or even felt the need to learn more) about him as a human being?As masterful as Christies writing was  it is said that such was her genius that she could knock a new mystery out in a week  it was always cool and clinical, oddly unsentimental and emotionally distant. She was always deliberately vague about revealing too much about Poirot, too. He is an enigmatically peculiar man, remembered more for his distinct physical appearance, his idiosyncrasies and eccentricities than anything else  not unlike Sherlock Holmes, James Bond or Tintin. We know nothing about his motivations, and even less about his past.Perhaps he operates out of ego  that is the most likely solution to his mystery. After all, Christie once described him as a detestable, bombastic, tiresome, ego-centric little creep. But in the opening scene of this film, after Poirot has, with trademark theatricality, pronounced a lawman as guilty of a crime, he turns away and immediately steps into a pile of dung. He glances down at the damage with an expression as blank as his character has been for more than a century, and in one innocuous move, alters it forever. Instead of cleaning the soiled shoe, he sinks his other, pristine foot into the dung as well.There is right, there is wrong, he declares to the utterly bamboozled man assigned the difficult task of escorting him to the Istanbul train station, in what is surely his attempt at an explanation. There is no in between.Branagh  despite having a head that isnt in the least shaped like an egg, and moustaches that (while being undeniably grand) arent at all like Christie described in the books  comes as close as any actor has come to capturing Poirots spirit, perhaps even more than Albert Finney, Peter Ustinov, or fan-favourite David Suchet. In his OCD, he finds the morality that drives him.And as he did with his Jack Ryan adaptation, Branagh (rather shamelessly) hogs the limelight, and delivers a performance so overwhelming that it threatens to derail most everything else. As Lumet did in his 1974 film, he assembles an all-star cast  Daisy Ridley, Michelle Pfeiffer, Penelope Cruz, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe and Johnny Depp step into their snazziest outfits and paste the gravest expressions on their faces to play suspects in what has to be, undeniably, the mother of all locked-room murder mysteries.By the way, heres the premise (in case youre still, even after 83 years, unfamiliar with it): While being snowed in during an overnight storm, a man is (brutally) killed on board the luxurious Orient Express, and only one of the 13 passengers on the first class compartment could have done it. Fortunately, through sheer luck, The Greatest Detective in the World also happens to be present, and is compelled  now we know why  to bring balance to this world.Branagh translates what is, by definition, a very stagey story through good, old-fashioned filmmaking. His direction is  elevated by Haris Zambarloukos stunning cinematography and Patrick Doyles lush orchestral score  as flamboyant as his performance. The same 65mm cameras that framed his stoic face in Christopher Nolans Dunkirk waltz around him in Murder on the Orient Express, alternating between intricate tracking shots, omnipotent overhead angles, and careful close-ups.There are however, some nagging issues  like every train journey youve ever been on, after the excitement of departure has died down, and before the eagerness of arrival has set in, there is a palpable lag during the second-act; and despite populating his cast with such splendid faces, theres little they are given to do to fuel the proceedings. Another cause for concern is how the films ending will play for those whove never experienced it. A lot relies on the reveal  its when Poirot is in his element, after all  and I wonder if Branaghs decision to simplify Christies labyrinthine plotting will affect the film in any way.But all these are minor quibbles. When the moment finally arrives  the suspects seated before him in a tableau reminiscent of the Last Supper, and the Orient Express looming large in the background  Branagh delivers his most moving surprise yet.As his impeccable hair falls out of place, and fresh snow sticks to his coat  a matter that would have at any other time caused him more pain than a bullet wound, and as Patrick Doyles score reaches crescendo and his voice quivers with emotion weve never heard before, Branagh unleashes a wallop of raw, unexpected sentimentality thatll strike you with the force of a steam engine.Broken souls are mended, old wounds are healed and order has been restored to the world; the Orient Express, is back on track. As the train finally arrives at its destination - thematically, and literally - Hercule Poirot is summoned to his next adventure. For our sake, lets hope were invited for the ride.Watch the Murder on the Orient Express trailer hereFollow @htshowbiz for moreThe author tweets @RohanNaahar"

It also was 69% less than what the movie brought in over its first weekend, a larger drop than usual for major blockbusters.The Last Jedi is slowing down at the box office, said Gitesh Pandya of Box Office Guru.

Photo: ReutersLos Angeles: The Force is strong with this one, too.Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the latest instalment of the epic sci-fi adventure series now owned by Walt Disney Co., met the high expectations set by movie fans and analysts with an opening weekend of $220 million in the US and the Canada.The results, based on estimates released on Sunday by ComScore Inc., put the film squarely ahead of last years spin-off movie Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which took in $158 million in its opening weekend. It will likely establish The Last Jedi as the top-grossing picture of 2017. The new film reaped $230 million in other countries around the world, except China, where it will open next month. Disney had expected $225 million overseas.Disney set a high bar for itself. The first chapter in the latest trilogy, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, took in an all-time North American record of $255 million in its opening weekend in 2015. Independent forecasts for The Last Jedi had run as high as $226 million from the Hollywood Stock Exchange and $210 million from Box Office Pro. Disney predicted the film would take in about $200 million.This just speaks to the power of Disney storytellinghow they are able to get their movies right time after time, said Geetha Ranganathan, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Especially this year when we have so much concern with sequilitis or franchise fatigue.The strong performance of The Last Jedi will reassure investors in Disney, which has at least five more Star Wars films in the works and last week made an even bigger commitment to the film business through its $66.1 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox Inc.s entertainment assets.The Last Jedi was well received by critics, with 96% positive reviews from top critics, according to aggregator RottenTomatoes.com. As they did for previous Star Wars films, fans began lining up outside theatres days before the debut. The film took in $45 million Thursday evening shows in the US and Canada, an amount bested only by The Force Awakens two years ago.To have a movie do $220 million domestically is an extraordinary thing and to be as close to the phenomenon that was The Force Awakens is certainly more than we expected, Dave Hollis, Disneys global head of distribution, said in a telephone interview on Sunday.The movie picks up where that film ended, with Rey, played by Daisy Ridley, seeking out Mark Hamills Luke Skywalker to encourage him to take up his light saber and fight with the Resistance. Carrie Fisher returned as Princess Leia. Fishers death in December 2016, after filming was complete, probably brought fans in to see her final performance.Younger actors, including Adam Driver as bad guy Kylo Ren, and John Boyega and Oscar Isaac, reprising their roles as Resistance fighters Finn and Poe Dameron, no doubt drew in a new generation of devotees.Some viewers have posted negative comments about the movie on RottenTomatoes, while other measures of audience reaction from Cinemascore and ComScore have been positive.Any online debate over the movie is just another reason to see the film, Hollis said. It turns conversation into fuel that ultimately drives people back into movie theatres, he said.Disney didnt disclose the budget of the film. The Force Awakens cost $245 million and brought in $2.07 billion worldwide over its theatrical run, including $936.7 million in North America.Fox offered the only other wide release this weekend with the animated film Ferdinand. It generated $13.3 million while coming in second. The story of a kind-hearted bull trying to find his way back home scored 75% positive reviews from top critics on RottenTomatoes. It had a production budget of $111 million and was projected to place second with $17 million on its debut, according to Box Office Mojo. Bloomberg"

The agriculture ministry thinks so and is hunting for commercially viable proposals in 12 pre-identified areas.The Narendra Modi governments Startup India scheme, which has a Rs10,000 crore war chest managed by the Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi), is seeking to incubate farm-solution startups through a contest called Agriculture Grand Challenge.I urge young entrepreneurs to participate in our newly launched Agriculture Grand Challenge and join forces to make agrarian sector technologically sound and commercially viable, farm minister Radha Mohan Singh said. The idea is to enable entrepreneurship and innovation, he said.A handful of startups for the rural economy are already a part of the growing ecosystem. India has more than 19,000 startups, led by consumer Internet and financial services apps, according to the Economic Survey 2015-16.From 220 in 2014, the number of startups funded in the first 10 months of 2017 stood at 482, according to data from Tracxn.As of December 2015, eight Indian startups belonged to the so-called Unicorn category, a club of ventures valued at $1 billion or more. Yet, fewer than 10% of these cater to the farm or social sector, according to Tracxn.A government document, which Hindustan Times has reviewed, states that private-sector startups could offer viable interventions in an array of areas, notably linking farmers to markets and offering extension services. It seeks to rev up an emerging niche area thats being dubbed as farming as a service, or FAAS.Proposals are being invited for simplified, sensor-based quick testing of soil samples as well as real-time assaying and grading of food commodities in electronically linked eNAM markets. The government has linked 470 mandis electronically but many of them lack crucial infrastructure: food labs to test samples being brought to these markets. The prospective app should preferably enable sample tests under two minutes to promote online trade.The government is interested in apps to connect food processors with agripreneurs and growers, an official said. To help price discovery, the ministry is looking at price forecast apps for pulses, oilseeds, potato, onion and tomato at the time of sowing since these crop are vulnerable to price volatility.According to the document, the success of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Indias main farm insurance scheme, depends on accurate yield estimates at village and farm levels for which it wants to incubate digital technologies.Another priority area is custom hiring of farm machinery and cheaper disposal of crop residue that has become a major reason for pollution in the national capital from neighbouring states during winters.Under the programme, commercially viable ideas will be incubated at the governments expense for three months. The last date for applications is January 15, 2018.Given the high penetration of Internet-enabled mobile phones, this is a good idea that can drive down cultivation costs, said Ashok Duggal, one of the promoters of VentureIndia Labs.A crop of startups aimed at harnessing the rural economy has made inroads already. AgroStar, a Pune-based mobile-commerce firm, directly sells farm inputs to farmers in Maharashtra and has raised more than $4 million. Farmers need to give a missed call to access its services.EM3, another firm, offers farm-labour services at Rs 2,000 an acre of wheat, which it claims is half of what it normally costs during peak season.The government document said it would prefer solutions that are scalable and can reach small farmers.The average size of farm holdings is 1.15 hectares. This means nearly 85% farmers are small and marginal. India has 120 million agricultural land holdings."

Barely three weeks back, 30 to 40 per cent of tomato crops were reportedly damaged.With low-pressure induced overcast condition prevailing in the region for the past five to six days, the temperature variations have enhanced the breeding capacities of pests and fungus. Due to this, vegetable plants are witnessing rotting of leaves and stems, horticulture officers said.While tomatoes, brinjal, cabbage and cauliflower plants have been witnessing the initial stages of fungus and pest attacks, so far reports of attack on capsicum havent cropped up, they added.I have cultivated cauliflower and cabbage over half-an-acre and tomato on another acre. However, signs of pest and fungus attacks have been detected on the standing crop, Manuel Xalxo, a farmer of Karimati village, said.Panposh Assistant Director of Horticulture (ADH) S P Nayak said the the department was keeping a close watch on the situation. We are advising farmers to start blanket spraying of pesticide and fungicide twice a week and later reduce it to once a week, he said.Nuagaon Block Chairman Maklu Ekka, who himself is a farmer, said spraying of pesticide and fungicide would not help until there is adequate sunlight.Small and marginal farmers are facing the real problem as after investing in kharif paddy crops, they have turned to vegetable crops. However, they do not have money for spraying pesticide and fungicide, horticulture officials added.The Block Chairman said areas including Joketa, Goldaru, Karimati,Barilepta, Garda, Sorda, Katepur, Banki, Jhariatola and Limda were reeling under incidents of pest attacks on tomatoes, cabbages and cauliflower crops."

With rain pouring down the streets, I knew I couldnt travel long distances. And the streets were either choked with traffic or blocked by collapsed trees.By afternoon, information had trickled in about cyclone Ockhi and I knew we had to be prepared for the worst.

The prices of the states leading crops - from pepper to cardamom, rubber to nutmeg and cocoa - are on a free fall while the prices of its vegetables, eggs, chicken, and fish, which Kerala depends on the neighbouring states, are shooting through the roof. Experts said the situation is alarming, and the way out of it is key policy changes by allowing farmers the freedom to bring in capital and technology to grow a fruit/vegetable he wants in vast areas of land.Right now, the rules allow only plantation crops, especially rubber, to be grown in over five acres of land, restricting farmers the freedom to farm crops that yield better returns. While pepper prices have fallen below Rs 400/kg compared to Rs 730-735/kg in the same period last year, cardamom prices have slipped to Rs 1,000/kg from Rs 1,500/ kg in May-June this year.Nutmeg prices declined from Rs 350/kg last year to Rs 200/kg while nutmeg flower prices have come down by Rs 1,350/kg to less than Rs 1000/kg in the same period. Clove prices fell from Rs 1050/kg to Rs 600/kg and cocoa from Rs 230-235 to Rs 160/kg. The only exception to this is coconut with prices ruling at Rs 30-35/piece, a two-year high, but low production means no big gains for farmers. In contrast, the prices of vegetables, which the state relies on neighbouring states, mostly Tamil Nadu, are skyrocketing.Small onion prices have gone up from Rs 40-50/kg to Rs 130/kg, tomatoes are ruling at Rs 60/kg, doubling from Rs 30/ kg some months ago, cabbage going up from Rs 18/kg to Rs 60/kg.

It has also started cultivating vegetables in the tribal settlement areas and equipping them to do so.While consulting experts, we realised the tribal people were in a bad shape due to lack of consuming enough vegetables, said Kothamangalam block panchayat vice-president Wilson Illickal, who inaugurated the project at Variyam, a tribal settlement area near Ernakulam-Idukki border.To begin with, Uriyam Petty, Variyam and Thera colonies in the Kuttampuzha panchayat were selected. Saplings of tomato, cauliflower, ladies finger, cabbage, brinjal and chilli were planted in about one acres of land. In the second phase, it will be extended to Thazhamkandam and other parts.Ten group of five people each have been formed to plant the saplings. The block panchayat has also set aside Rs 5 lakh, which will be distributed as an incentive for cultivating vegetables, said block panchayat member Santhamma Pious, who works closely with the tribal people.Price of vegetables and scarcity in tribal areas have also stopped them from consuming vegetables.

Manimegalai, a home maker from Puliyakulam whose family budget is dependent only on her husbands income, increase in the price of some of the vegetables has led to changes in the daily expenditure.The weekly Uzhavar Santhai used to be a boon for mid and low income families. Now, farmers who sell vegetables directly have also increased prices citing changes in retail market. Hike in the price of coconut has forced us to replace thengai chutney with sambar or thakkali chutney . Luckily, price of tomato has not increased as much as it shot up in July, said Ms. Manimegalai. Quoting some of her neighbours, she said families are buying vegetables in bulk and storing them in refrigerator when prices are low.A vendor from a neighbourhood grocery store near Sivaram Nagar said that sale of vegetables has come down as as she was, with no option left, already selling them at a few paise/rupee higher than the price of vegetables at bigger retail stores.For vegetable buyers in the city, prices of small onions, coconuts, and tomatoes have shot up during the last few days, making many reluctant to buy these. Even in the weekly markets, the prices are high. I have stopped buying small onions, says Jothimani, a resident of Ramanathapuram.Prices of small onions is expected to hover around Rs. 120-140 for another two to three months and prices of tomatoes will come down in a fortnight, said M.R. Palanisamy, Deputy Director of Agriculture Marketing here.According to M. Rajendran, president of Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants Association, small onion prices might touch Rs. 200 a kg in the retail market. This is mainly because of drought last year and recent heavy unseasonal rains in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Farmers are not benefiting from the price rise.The wholesale price of small onions is about Rs. 140. If we used to get 2,000 bags of small onions in the market a day, it has dwindled to 200 bags now. Coconut prices are up because trees dried in Pollachi area and many have cut down the trees because of drought earlier this year. It will take another three months for arrivals to pick up.Prices of most of the vegetables are above Rs. 50 a kg. It will take one or two months for the prices to stabilise. Farmers who cultivated small onions on about 950 hectares in Thondamuthur area saw a bumper crop this season. They did not get a good price last month.Traders and farmers who had stored small onions were getting good prices now, said trade and official sources.The prices were between Rs. 60 and Rs. 100 last week and increased to Rs. 115 to Rs. 120 now in the wholesale market.The retail price at Uzhavar Santhai on Wednesday was between Rs. 130 and Rs. 135. Bulk buying by the traders for exporting to Middle-East countries might also be a reason for the price rise, said Mr. Palanisamy.However, the prices of country tomato which was just about Rs. 30-a-kg last week has increased to Rs. 35- 38 per kg in Uzhavar Santhais on Wednesday. The prices of tomato is expected to come down in a fortnight, when farmers in Madukkarai block will begin harvest. Tomato was cultivated in 370 hectares in Madukkarai block and 80 hectare in other blocks in Coimbatore district, he said.Farmers Association (Tamilaga Vivasayeegal Sangam) secretary P. Kandasamy said farmers decided when to sell produce based on their needs than on market price.Most often the market intelligence reports were of little help to them as they did not, so far, factor in movement of produce from other States to the city.Having seen prices crash in local markets due to arrival of vegetables from other States, the local farmers had begun taking their needs into account to sell produce.The Government should ensure farmers get a stable price throughout the season, Mr. Rajendran said.(with inputs from R.

Even the price of tomatoes has remained on the higher side, with the selling price hovering around Rs. 40 a kg, he said.Datta, manager at a HOPCOMS procurement centre, said there has been a drop in supply of onions from the major onion markets in north Karnataka and Maharashtra. This is following a fall in production owing to untimely rains.We have no agreement with the farmers on onion procurement. Therefore, we procure them directly from the wholesale dealers at the APMC [yard].

He said the Centre was keen to launch some pilot projects in the State going by its impressive track record in implementing several schemes.

This is precisely what the worldwide tour Bhairav Se Bhairavi Tak being undertaken by renowned vocalists, Pandit Rajan and Sajan Mishra, which commenced from Varanasi recently, signifies. We were seized of the ongoing violence and terrorism world over, which only harms humanity without serving any purpose. Wondering what to do, we decided to propagate peace and brotherhood through our music, explains Rajan Mishra as we settle down for a quiet lunch at Shangri-Las Eros Hotels Tamra restaurant. Agreeing Sajan Mishra, adds, music has tremendous power to move human hearts.We ask for green tea to be followed by som tam, the Thai papaya salad. The staff suggests tomato and bocconcini sandwich to which they readily agree. As in music where we keep exploring ragas, we also experiment with food too, quips Sajan Mishra.Power of musicOne wonders as to how music can help? The entire planet and nature is enveloped in music. Our voice is sound or swara and the heart and pulse beats are layas. Nobody is beyond music as it strikes a chord with all living beings instantly. In fact, the whole cosmic energy moves in rhythm. We have formed rapport through music with even those who do not know our language. In Paris, the audience approached us for autographs with tears rolling down their eyes. Such is the power of melody, relates Rajan Mishra.Sajan Mishra cites the example of their concert at Maastricht, Holland, where audience did not clap. Wondering what went wrong, we were later informed by them that they did not want to disturb the harmony created by the music. That is one of the best compliments we have been paid ever.Has singing given them tranquillity? Besides name and fame, it has given a spiritual dimension to our life making us at peace. Be it riyaaz or concert, we remember Goddess Saraswati and our forefathers and seek their blessings and start. Closing our eyes we are lost and sing to our satisfaction ensuring the audience follows and they do. Recently at Delhi Universitys Shivaji College, we sang for three hours without any student leaving the hall.Driving home the point, Sajan Mishra recalls that once they rushed from a Ganesh Utsav recital at Pune to Mumbai to catch a flight to Malaga in Spain for another show. We did not sleep a wink. Reaching the venue, we splashed water and changed into fresh clothes. We were bone tired yet on the stage with tanpura and tabla as accompaniments, we felt no fatigue and gave a memorable performance.So will this whirlwind tour involve long concerts encompassing all ragas from Bhairav to Bhairavi. Sajan Mishra expounds: We are talking about the whole spectrum and bouquet of ragas and not necessarily from early morning to evening. In lots of places, there are issues concerning audience, auditorium, timings, or security and so keeping those in mind we have worked out various permutations and combinations to bring fore the flavour of ragas. In Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Delhi and Bengaluru, we are doing two concerts, morning and evening just as in Houston. In London we will start at 1 p.m. Adding Rajan Mishra says, Bhairav is an important raga which is sung at dawn just when sun rays start dissipating darkness, has mircotones of Rishabh and Dhaiwat being used. There are several types of Bhairav like Lalit, Ahir, Bairagi and Nat. Bhairavi, a ragini of Bhairav, uses many surs and shudh surs and brings down curtain on a performance. His short demo of the two have heads turning around in awe and admiration.With sandwich and salad being laid, we take a break. Tasting them, the two approve much to the delight of the staff. Bahut achha hai, remarks Rajan Mishra, who loves food and is eager to taste all things new. I like almost all regional cuisines, be it Gujarati, Rajasthani, Uttar Pradesh, Punjabi or South Indian. My favourites include dal-chawal, khichdi, khandvi, undhiyu, rohu fish, bhaat-jhol, dosa, idli, paniharam and appam. Food like music is a labour of love and brings happiness, satisfaction and peace to one making as well as eating. Sajan Mishra, prefers food from UP, Rajasthan and Punjab. They are rich in taste. These regions offer great variety like dal bati choorma, kachhi methi ki and sangria ki subzis, different parathas and dahi.When asked if he cooks, Rajan Mishra replies promptly: Mujhe toh nimbu bhi katna nahi ata. He quietly lets it slip in that Sajan Mishra is a fabulous cook reputed for his dal and chicken preparations. I never had formal training and dont depend on recipes. Having observed my mother and chachi, I started out when we had to fend on our own in Delhi many years ago. Recalling what I had observed, my first attempt yielded delicious dal and gobhi subzi. The bhindi I did not realise had to be washed before being cut. It didnt get cooked despite several helpings of ghee and oil. Our friend sarod player, Ashok Roy and his wife, dropped in. They enjoyed dal and gobhi and quietly ate the bhindi without any comment, quips Sajan Mishra.Such is his love for food that at Vlodrop, Holland, during a tour organised by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, on finding the food placid, Sajan Mishra, decided to use some tadka in the dal and vegetables. I purchased ginger, garlic, chillies and other condiments and decided to use the electric kettle. About to start, Maharishis nephew Girish dropped in unexpectedly. Getting the fragrance, he remarked, Can we also have some of this, and I said join the party. Once, Ritesh, my nephew, requested for kadhi, which I had never made before. With everything ready, I used the curd in the fridge and later the whole place was filled with a strong aroma of strawberry. Investigating I found myself staring at the red kadhi as I had used strawberry curd. Quietly, I dumped it far away. No wonder, they say, raag rasoi pagdi kabhi kabhi bandh jaye (music, food and pagdi sometimes turns to be excellent), he chuckles loudly.On a serious note, Rajan Mishra, is appalled with the burden of studies on children these days. In our time, we studied, played, indulged in pranks and also bunked to watch movies. They couldnt be serious. We had been caught and punished too. Our gurus, grandfather, Bade Ram Das Ji Mishra, father, Hanuman Prasad Mishra and uncle, Gopal Prasad Mishra insisted that sports is required to keep fit and healthy. They insisted on complete concentration, singing with heart and soul instead of treating it as a drill. That helped us to do well in studies too. While Rajan Mishra has a masters degree in sociology, Sajan Mishra graduated from Banaras Hindu University.With great masters at constant attendance, it must have been advantageous. Yes, we were helped by nature and nurture but they never favoured us. The taalim was without fear or favour. They instructed us to listen to other great masters and imbibe their qualities. So we learnt the grasp on sur from Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, while Ustad Vilayat Khan, sitar maestro taught us that the tempo of laya and taan should always synchronise, replies Rajan Mishra.New generation singersTalking about the new generation of singers, Rajan Mishra says, They are extraordinarily talented. All they need is stay away from diversions like mobile, television, internet and computer. Forgetting about updating Facebook, they need to concentrate on studies and music. Rajan Mishra loves to teach while Sajan Mishra fills in his absence. Main unko workout karata hoon, bhai sahib daud lagwate hain (I give workout while brother makes them run), he jests making Rajan Mishra smile.With the brothers declining desserts, one wonders if is a precautionary measure? No, we love khoye ki mithai, sandesh, Banarasi jalebi and sohan halwa, replies Rajan Mishra, and as for precaution, you will be surprised we eat everything. Finding me surprised, he says, Eating is closely related to psychology. The moment you think gol gappa pani will affect the throat, it will. We eat everything bindaas  chutni, aachar, papad, chaat, bhel puri, dahi bhalla, pav bhaji, sev puri, ice creams and drink chilled water. It has never affected our voice. Sajan Mishra adds, Riyaaz cleans up everything. Did you know Begum Akhtar used to eat paan and drink ice water but her voice remained golden.Nobody is beyond music as it strikes a chord with all living beings instantly. In fact, the whole cosmic energy moves in rhythmRajan Mishra"

Traders said tomatoes cost Rs. 40 per kg due to shortage in supply, while onions were at Rs. 35 per kg. Rising prices of both vegetables over the past four weeks has inconvenienced both consumers and sellers alike, traders said.Officials at the APMC said both crops were hit by unseasonal rain, pushing the wholesale prices of tomato to between Rs. 30 and Rs. 40 per kg, and to between Rs. 50 and Rs. 60 in retail outlets. Onion prices, too, went up, selling in retail for Rs. 50 to Rs. 60, depending on quality and location.

Around 245 trucks of onion arrived on Thursday and Friday, pushing prices down. Were expecting a fresh stock of onions on Monday. This will bring down the rates further. Within a weeks time, rates will regularise to Rs. 15 to Rs. 20.Tomato, which usually costs between Rs. 18 to Rs. 25 per kg, was being sold at Rs. 45 per kg at the APMC on Friday. Shankar Pingle, former director, vegetables division, APMC, said. Usually, the tomato season starts by mid-October, bring prices down. This time, the tomato crop has been affected by rains in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh in September. During the same time last year, tomatoes cost Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 per kg.Anil Rai, who is among the top tomato dealers in the market, said, On an average, 100 trucks would come to the APMC, each bearing 10 tonnes of tomatoes. This would be distributed across Mumbai Metropolitan Region. However, no supply at all from Karnataka has affected us the most. Whatever is coming to the market is from nearby districts including Nashik, Pune and Satara, but it isnt enough. As per APMC records, the vegetables division received around 40 vehicles of tomatoes on Friday.Mr. Rai added that as the tomato crop cycle is of 90 days, farmers have sown again and this produce is expected in the next 15 to 20 days. This will bring down rates further."

The farmers said that the elephants had been seen in the vicinity of of Agasthya Foundation zone during the last three days, despite the efforts of the forest personnel to drive them back deep inside the forests.The villagers said that the herd camped in Mallappakonda hillock region in Gudupalle mandal, criss-crossing the borders of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Farmers, who grow the crops of tomato, beans and ragi, are a worried lot.The forest personnel have tracked the movement of the herd, which would reconnoiter the fields at nights. Trackers were also arranged in an effort to prevent them from invading human habitations at the forest fringe villages.Divisional Forest Officer T. Chakrapani said that the forest officials from Kuppam rushed to the spot, and drove back the elephants.Meanwhile, heavy rains in Koundinya wildlife sanctuary in Chittoor district, and in the thick forests of V.Kota, Ramakuppam in Kuppam constituency and its adjoining Maharaja Kadai forests in Tamil Nadu in September and October have resulted in sufficient water sources and fodder to the wild elephants criss-crossing the tri-State junction.The forest officials said that during the six months, the problem has been reduced to a minmum, thanks to congenial climate to the wildlife. All the check-dams and ponds in the reserve forests abutting the tri-State junction are brimming with water. The question of fodder crisis will also unlikely to arise in the near future.In spite of the satisfactory scenario in the deep forests, the elephants are known for raiding crops, lured by the paddy and sugarcane fields. Three years ago, the officials counted the figure of wild elephants in tri-State junction at 34. In 2015, three elephants, including a calf, died due to electrocution and confinement. Generally, the movement of wild elephants criss-crossing Kuppam, Ramakuppam, Gudupalle and Shantipuram towards neighbouring Karnataka and Tamil Nadu becomes a phenomenon between November and January, with reports of extensive crop damages."

One such project is the Madurai-Bodinaickanur broad gauge conversion project.The Railways has started work on building subways and bridges on this 90-km line that passes through Usilampatii, Andipatti and Theni. The Madurai-Bodi line is one of the two metre gauge lines in the State yet to be converted to BG, the other being Thiruthuraipoondi-Agasthiampalli line.When the last MG train was operated on December 31, 2010, commuters and villagers gave an emotional farewell to the train right from Madurai to Bodi and back. At that time, these people had fond hopes of one day soon travelling on direct trains to Chennai, Bengaluru and other cities without travelling all the way to Dindigul or Madurai.But, in the following years, their hopes were dashed when the project was put on cold storage while the Southern Railway concentrated on Shencottah-Kollam, Dindigul-Palakkad/Podanur and Karaikudi-Tiruvarur BG conversion projects.But for vociferous protests by trade bodies, elected representatives - former and current - in Madurai and Theni districts, the Bodi project could have been shelved as non-viable.When I was posted in Bodi, I used to take my family by train from Nagamalai Pudukottai station often. Our Brownie would travel in the dog box. Everybody used to enjoy the journey, said T.S. Rajaiah, former Joint Director of Agriculture. He recalled that when Pandiyan Roadways Corporation took over the reins from TVS and increased the fare to 35 paise from 5 paise, 10 paise tickets, people switched loyalty to the Bodi train to travel to Madurai.A. Michael of SS Colony, retired Locomotive Pilot who drove the last MG train from Madurai to Bodi and back, said there was a certain bonhomie on this route. The crew and the season ticket holders used to chat and joke and though the train was slow, it catered to students and office-goers.According to B. Velmurugan, secretary of Bodi Merchants Association, Students and employees of Theni Collectorate, Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar College in Usilampatti, Arul Anandar College in Karumathur and Madurai Kamaraj university used this train every day, he said.A large number of migrant workers from Theni district, especially in Information Technology industry, travel regularly to Chennai and Bengaluru. In the absence of affordable and comfortable train travel, people are forced to travel by the 129 omni buses being operated from Cumbum, Bodi, Theni, Chinnamanur, Uthamapalayam, Thevaram, Periyakulam and other places, Mr. Velmurugan added.S. Muthuramalingam, a silk cotton merchant, said that more than the passenger traffic, this region had huge potential to transport cardamom, silk cotton, grapes, tomatoes, plantains, mangoes, pepper, tea and coffee. A bale of cotton that costs Rs. 250 to transport to Gujarat by train costs Rs. 750 when sent by lorry. Moreover railways gives concession for bulk consignments, he said.M. Sampath, a cardamom and pepper merchant, said, About 80,000 kg to 1 lakh kg of cardamom is sent by road from Bodi to New Delhi, Kanpur, Kolkata and Mumbai on an auction day. But it incurred pilferage, corruption and delay. Bodi traders used to send goods from Erode so as to avoid transhipment, if sent from Madurai or Dindigul. If the Madurai-Bodi line is expedited, it will be a win-win situation for both the traders and the railways.The traders want Bodi station to be a terminus with all facilities such as pit lines for maintenance of coaches so that long distance trains could be operated.

Its impact will continue to hurt people for some days yet. As residents rushed to stock up on vegetables after the rain largely kept off during the day, they realised that not much was available in the local markets or Chala.Whatever little was available was a few days old. If at all new stock was available, it was of poor quality.A retail vegetable seller in Karamana said prices of some vegetables had risen steeply. Carrots, for instance, cost Rs. 110 to Rs. 130 a kg, depending on quality. Some vegetables are not available. There are no curry leaves to be had. Lemons too are difficult to come by, the vendor said. Picking up the thundan chilli variety, he said those were starting to rot though they had just been bought. These cost Rs. 140. A few days ago, large thundan chillies cost Rs. 120.A wholesale dealer in Chala market said they had last received fresh stock two days ago, but had run out of those. To meet their commitments, including that to supermarkets, they are forced to buy vegetables from within the Chala market. We have placed orders, but our suppliers in Tamil Nadu say they are not getting enough vegetables. We are selling tomatoes at Rs. 60, but there is almost no stock left. Drumstick, he said, cost Rs. 200 a kg.A wholesale plantain dealer said he sold the nendran variety at Rs. 32, but prices would go down further owing to large-scale damage to plantain crop in Parassala, Kaliyikkavila and growing areas in Tamil Nadu.A retail vendor said prices, which had just started to stabilise, would rise in the aftermath of Ockhi. Some vegetables are not available. Others such as tomato, the price of which had just dipped to Rs. 55 a kg, will now shoot up. On Sunday, tomato cost Rs. 80 a kg.Horticorp chairman Vinayan said supply from other States had not been affected, but Ockhi had inflicted damage in areas where crops such as carrot, cabbage, and cauliflower were grown in the State. There is harvested stock for now, but whatever had been sown has been lost, and the real impact will be felt in a couple of months."

As the BJP tries to win back its loyal supporters, Gujarat Deputy Chief Minister Nitinbhai Patel speaks in the midst of hectic campaigning in Mehsana.The Patidar factor or their anger seems to be your biggest challenge. Whats your assessment?When the agitation began, there was more support. However, we have been able to address the issues by starting new schemes for non-reserved categories, including Patidars.For example, when a boy or a girl who takes admission to a self-financing college or a government institution, the Gujarat government pays 50% of the tuition fee. It covers engineering or medical colleges.When a rural student stays in a hostel, the government now pays up to Rs. 1,200 of the food bill. From primary to Class 12 students, books and uniforms are given by the government. Earlier, these used to be given to only students of SC and ST but we have done away with the distinction.After Congress leader Kapil Sibal offered a formula for reservation to PAAS leaders, your comment that a foolish formula had been offered to fools became controversial, as insulting your community.I had said the Supreme Court, through various judgments, has made it clear that there can be no reservation beyond the existing ceiling (50% reservation limit). Despite knowing this, a well-known lawyer like Kapil Sibal had offered a formula. He himself knows that it will be struck down in one appeal. But to take political advantage, he misled everyone. The Congress, even till this minute, has still not made the formula public.When such a big lawyer, after knowing Supreme Court judgments, offers a formula, then it is making fools out of those fellows who are part of their [PAAS] core group. I didnt say anything insulting about our community.The Congress has also questioned your development model and has alleged that vikas has gone mad. Your response?If they are fighting an election, they have to say something for campaigning. You are travelling around the State and you must have seen how good the roads are. Look at our power situation, look at our water supply or our agriculture. We have the best of best infrastructure in Gujarat. Whether it is a tribal village or a remote part of the State, every part has good connectivity and good infrastructure.Rahul Gandhi is campaigning hard in Gujarat this time. His rallies are being well attended and it is being said that people are listening to what he has to say. How do you view it?Even in this small village, people of all ages have come  from children to seniors. So people come to see him as well but it does not mean that they will vote. And the Congress also gets people from outside to fill its meetings. When a leader or an actor comes, people come to see them but it doesnt mean they will get support. Even during Indira jis time there used to be people. Sonia Gandhi also used to come to Gujarat frequently yet we have been ruling the State for 22 years. In recent times, they have lost eight State elections and more recently, they got wiped out in Uttar Pradesh. Last week, in civic polls, they lost even Amethi that has been with them for the last 50 years.Mr. Gandhi hasnt said anything about that. It is clear that people these days want to see work and not go by name alone.The Congress and Mr. Gandhi have raised the issue of price rise or monghvari in Gujarati and people are connecting with the issue. Whats your take?Price rise has two aspects. A farmer wants good price for his produce and the consumer wants the same at minimum price. As a government, it is our responsibility to manage both. Many a time when there is a temporary surge, it naturally applies to all equally. It is not as if prices have gone up because there is a BJP government in Gujarat. In Karnataka, there is a Congress government and tomatoes, potatoes and onions would be similarly priced. Or in Kerala where there is a Communist government, prices of vegetables would be similar.How many seats will the BJP get in these elections?We have already accepted the challenge of 150 plus seats. We have done good work and peoples faith and support are with us.You dont think there is anti-incumbency?We dont have anti-incumbency as we have delivered. Governments that dont work start feeling anti-incumbency but our ministers, MLAs, workers all go and work among the people. Nobody can tell us that we have come to the people after five years. We firmly believe that we will get 150 seats.If they [the Congress] are fighting an election, they have to say something for campaigning"

More significantly, the economy clocked a growth of 6.3% in the second quarter of this year, after slowing for at least four quarters. But official data for the third quarter (October to December) so far suggest that the economy is still not entirely out of the woods and fresh headwinds, such as rising oil prices, could upset the fragile recovery. Manufacturing growth, driven by restocking by producers after the rollout of the goods and services tax, was a major factor in the second quarter growth pick-up. After two months of robust 4%-plus growth, industrial activity however slipped in October, with the Index of Industrial Production reflecting just 2.2% growth. October was a festive month but consumer durables production contracted by nearly 7%, mining was virtually stagnant, and manufacturing growth moderated to 2.5% from 3.8% last year. This coincides with exporters seeing a 1.1% slump in shipments in October, after growing at an average of over 13% in the second quarter. It is also borne out by the nearly 10% drop in GST collections that month compared to September. The IIP has now grown just 2.5% in the first seven months of 2017-18, compared to 5.5% in the same period last fiscal.If the spectre of slower growth with weak exports at a time when global trade is recovering is not worrying enough, with job creation still to pick up, the latest inflation data set too is cause for concern. Prices at the consumer level rose at the fastest pace in 15 months this November, with inflation touching 4.88%, up from 3.6% in October and just 1.5% in June. This reflects a broad-based price rise under way, although it is led by fuel inflation (at 7.2%, from 6.1% a month ago) and food inflation (4.4%, from 1.9% in October). Within food, rising onion and tomato prices pushed vegetable inflation to a 16-month high of 22.5%; inflation in egg prices quickened from 0.8% in October to 8% in November. While some of this food inflation could wane in the coming months, there is greater concern about the rise in core inflation (excluding food and fuel) and inflation imported through high global prices. On Tuesday, oil prices breached the $65 a barrel mark for the first time in over two years. The government faces difficult choices. Slashing fuel taxes could calm inflation, but it would hit revenue collections that are already uncertain owing to GST deadline extensions. Not doing so would leave less room for the central bank to lower interest rates. As the Economic Survey said, oil at $60-65 could hit consumption and public investment and dent private investment further. That is not a path to a sustained revival."

(Express Photo: Gurmeet Singh) Rural India has lagged behind the cities since the 1991 economic reforms. (Express Photo: Gurmeet Singh)Bharat vs India, a phrase coined by Charan Singh to describe the conflict between villages and cities, remains relevant. This is evident from the Kisan Sansad (farmers parliament) that met in Delhi last month. More than 40,000 peasants belonging to 180 farmers organisations came together to form the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC).Rural India has lagged behind the cities since the 1991 economic reforms. According to the National Sample Survey, the average Monthly Per Capita Expenditure (MPCE) in 1993-94 was Rs 281 in rural India and Rs 458 in urban India. It rose to Rs 772 (up 174 per cent) and Rs 1,472 (up 221 per cent) for rural and urban India respectively in 2007-08, which means that the gap between rural and urban jumped from 63 to 91 percentage points. The gap diminished somewhat between 2007-08 and 2011-12, with rural MPCE reaching Rs 1,430 (up 85 per cent) as an average and the urban rising to 2,630 (up 79 per cent), but it remained more than 20 percentage points higher than what it was in 1993-94 at 84 percentage points.This is partly due to the slow growth of agriculture over the last decade. Between the years 2005-06 and 2011-12, the average annual growth rate of industry at constant 2004-05 prices has been 7.5 per cent, while services grew at an ever-quicker pace, 9.95 per cent. However, agriculture lagged behind at 3.8 per cent. In the following three years, 2012-2015, the average agricultural GDP growth rate was 1.7 per cent. In 2014-15, the growth rate of agriculture was negative at  0.2 per cent. It was only 1.1 per cent in 2015-16 and, thanks to a good monsoon, about 4 per cent in 2016-17, the growth rate the five-year plan considered as necessary to ensure food security.Different factors are responsible for these changes. First, the size of holdings has shrunk over the years: The average land owned by peasants fell from 0.725 ha to 0.592 ha between 2002-03 and 2012-13. As a result, the proportion of those owning less than one ha increased from 79.7 per cent to 82.8 per cent. Since a farm household needs at least 1 hectare of land to make ends meet, over half of the farmers are in debt: The average loan amount for a farm household in India today is Rs 47,000. Second, irrigation has stagnated with less than half of Indian farmland irrigated, partly because of the groundwater crisis: Water tables fell by 65 per cent in 10 years. Third, peasants suffer from one obsession of the government: The price of food. To neutralise any risk of inflation on that front, the growth rate of rural wages has been limited  in 2015, it was the lowest in 10 years (and lower than the inflation rate). That was related to the squeezing of the MGNREGA programme, which was blamed for rising rural wages. But more than wages, food prices were targeted. To spare urban consumers, they were kept low and the government even precipitated food prices deflation by allowing imports. Soyabean is a case in point, when this year market was flooded with cheap soyabean oil imports. Though the government can impose duty up to 45 per cent, but it kept the rate at 12.5 per cent.In 2017 summer, farmers across India started agitating for better prices. They wanted the M.S. Swaminathan Commission report, which recommended minimum support prices, to be implemented. Maharashtra farmers demanded better prices for onions and other pulses; in Himachal Pradesh, it was for tomatoes; in Punjab and Haryana, it was potatoes and maize; in Rajasthan, garlic; in Gujarat, groundnuts; in Madhya Pradesh, soyabean; in Andhra, Telangana and Karnataka, chilli and so on. In June, when Maharashtra farmers, who were on strike, took out a march to Mumbai, the BJP government agreed to a Rs 30,000-crore loan waiver. The protest spread to Madhya Pradesh, where five people were killed in Mandsaur district in police firing. Farmers mobilised also because of demonetisation, which badly affected rural India.Though the agitation fit the traditional pattern of kisan politics, the mobilisations, unlike in the previous decades, achieved little. Loans were waived for peasants, mainly in Maharashtra and UP. However, this measure didnt help much. The procedure to receive reimbursement is bureaucratic and the amount waived is sometimes minimal (Rs 10 to Rs 500). Besides, only a third of the small and marginal farmers have access to institutional credit: Banks do not lend money to the poor. The others turn to money lenders, who do not waive loans. Besides, loan waiver is only a temporary relief.Why did the peasant mobilisations achieve so little? The reason could be the urban consumer bias of the BJP, the new political hegemon. The party has turned its back to the Gandhian dimension of Deendayal Upadhyayas Jana Sangh and is focussed on urban development, as evident from the smart cities flagship programme. It sees industrialisation as the best way to modernise India and create jobs. More urban dwellers supported the party than villagers in the 2014 election  by 10 percentage points, according to the CSDS-Lokniti survey. The urban bias of the government was obvious in its attempt to amend the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2015 in favour of industrialists. When the Opposition forced the government to backtrack, Prime Minister Modi invited the states to reform and the BJP-ruled states were the first to change the law.Budget cuts have reduced the spending on the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana and the Integrated Watershed Management Programme and Accelerated Irrigation Benefits and Flood Management Programme. In this context, it isnt surprising that 40 per cent of Indian farmers do not like to farm any more. Hence the demand among young Patels, Marathas, Jats and Kapus for reservations in the (urban) public sector.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

But after reaching the market, he was disappointed in the wake of the extremely low prices he got for his greens.A couple of months ago, he sold the same quantity of greens for Rs. 1,000. However, this time, he had no choice but to accept Rs. 300 for his produce.The crash in the prices of vegetables in the market here has, on the one hand, brought cheer among customers as they are buying greens and vegetables at a cheaper price, the farmers, on the other, are extremely disappointed as they are unable to retrieve even the cost of cultivation and transportation.Sunday, when the main vegetable market functions in the district, witnessed vegetable being sold at the lowest price in the last three months. While a small bunch of coriander cost Rs. 10-Rs. 15 sometime ago, on Sunday customers bought five such bunches for a mere Rs. 10 in the retail market.Other green vegetables are also being sold at such low prices allowing customers to buy more vegetables for a small price.Tomatoes, which were sold at around Rs. 60- Rs. 80 per kg till about three months ago, are now available at Rs. 7- Rs. 10 per kg.Besides the general public, hotels and restaurants owners are delighted as they are able to buy huge quantity of vegetables at small prices.The farmers believe that owing to good monsoon, many farmers have cultivated vegetables in their fields, because of which prices have sharply declined.In the summer, only those farmers who have irrigation facility cultivate vegetables; therefore, the prices go up owing to limited cultivation of vegetables.But post-monsoon, since most of the fields have adequate moisture, farmers use the opportunity to cultivate short-term vegetable crops. When most of them do the same thing, the prices obviously come down in the market, said an official in the Horticulture Department.While the prices of a majority of vegetables have dipped sharply, the onion farmers are in a good mood because of a better price their produce is fetching  Rs. 40-Rs. 50 per kg. Onion was sold at about Rs. 20 per kg a couple of months ago."

Tomatoes have been withdrawn from McDonalds items because, according to the company, there have been quality issues with the produce.In Maharashtra, most of the the winter crop of tomato comes from Niphad and its adjoining talukas in Nashik district, while the Junnar tehsil in Pune provides the summer crop. Multi-national chains usually follow a farm-to-fork model, under which growers directly supply the produce to their stores.Selected stores of McDonalds follow the same model in Maharashtra. Confirming that McDonalds outlets in the state have stopped serving tomatoes since last week, a spokesperson of the fast food chain said, We have observed certain quality issues in tomatoes and the current supplies are not meeting McDonalds stringent quality standards. So, we have decided against using the ingredient in certain cities.The spokesperson added that the chain was monitoring supplies on a daily basis and would start serving tomatoes as soon as the produce met their quality standards. On the other hand, growers lamented that heavy rain in Nashik during the fag end of monsoon season had affected the produce. Santosh Gorade, a farmer from Takli village in Niphad taluka, said heavy rain had washed away almost 80-90 per cent of the crop. The crop was almost market-ready, but the rain destroyed it.

Besides the poor arrivals, marriage season added to the supply-demand gap in carrots as many consumers bought vegetables directly from the wholesale markets in bulk quantities. Those who visit rythu bazaars hardly come forward to buy carrots and a few end up buying 100 to 250 grams, says P. Rameshwari, a farmer from K. Kotapadu.Consultant of Horticulture Department Y.

However, the production is comparatively low even in these areas. The arrivals are likely to improve in the coming weeks with the harvest of the crops sown by local farmers, he observes.Main rythu bazaars such as Gopalapatnam, Kancharapalem, Akkayapalem, MVP Colony and Seethammadhara used to get one to two tonnes of carrot a day.

But the calm is misleading as the electoral battle in Vadodara reflects the larger contest in the State with the Congress trying to break into this BJP fort.For the BJP, it is a prestige battle for repeating its clean sweep of all 10 seats in the district in the 2012 Assembly elections. After Mr. Modi vacated his Lok Sabha seat preferring Varanasi, the partys nominee won with a handsome margin in the byelection.Dropping marginThe margin of our defeat in every Assembly segment during the Lok Sabha polls was 50,000 or more. But this dropped to 15,000 in 2015, when the civic elections were held. We lost the seats, but our votes went up, says Ami Ravat, an urban planner who became a Congress municipal councillor two years ago. She is now a ticket hopeful for the Sayajiganj Assembly seat.Her husband, Narendra Ravat, a general secretary of the Congress in the State, too is a contender. Though he lost the Lok Sabha bypoll in Vadodara, he says the absence of Narendra Modi as Chief Minister has made a big difference now.The Congress in Gujarat has popularised a social media campaign, Vikas Gando Thayo Che (Development gone crazy), and is banking on the anger among voters who are now willing to ask questions to the BJP government.In Vadodara city, people agree that the Congress has registered a strong presence this time, but is still not a threat to the BJP.Yes, the Congresss central leadership is campaigning extensively in Gujarat. I have seen that people are going for Rahul Gandhis rally, but they have nothing to offer except their anti-BJP stance, Yogesh Bhai Patel, a six-time MLA, says.There is a drinking water problem. The Congress wont tell you what it will do but will simply criticise us, says Mr. Patel, who avoids giving a clear answer on the impact of the Patidar agitation.My sense is we are not affected here in central Gujarat; you please ask me questions related to Vadodara, he says.But barely 30 km out of the city, people are more forthcoming with their views.At Fartikui, a model village with a predominant Patel population that boasts a government school, a dispensary, a milk collection centre and filtration plant for drinking water, the mood is split down the middle.Village elders, mostly Patidars, sitting under a banyan tree at the main chowk (centre), say there is no water to irrigate the fields of cotton and tur dal. Prices of diesel and fertilizers are rising.Vegetables such as onions and tomatoes are out of reach of the common man. Earlier, they would blame the Congress government at the Centre. Now they cant do that, Mahindra Bhai Daya Bhai Patel, a farmer, says.Asked about the Patidar demand for reservation, he wonders, How can any party offer it if the Constitution doesnt allow it?This group says that while the Congress candidate Sidharth Patel (son of the former Chief Minister Chimanbhai Patel) is a local, his BJP rival, Shailesh Mehta, is an outsider and Brahmin.The story repeats itself in Dabhoi on the outskirts of Vadodara and in other constituencies in Vadodara district. Padra, Savli and Vaghoria are among the seats where the BJP is battling dissidence and open defiance against the partys official nominee.No, these are not serious issues, only internal differences. That will get sorted out on its own, Mr. Yogesh Patel says."

But these days she is faced with a tough choice, whether to add onions to the food items or not. That's because the price of onions is steadily climbing the charts and has reached Rs 50/kg in the retail market, up by Rs 10 from last week. And if market insiders are to be believed, the cost could go up further.The spike in onion prices, along with the rise in the cost of vegetables are burning a hole in the pocket of the common people. Even the state government's assurance to deal with the price rise by importing onions from neighbouring states have failed to yield results.""Usually I require around 2-3 kg of onions every week to cook food for my family of five. After the price rise I am trying to manage with 1kg. I am finding it very difficult to cook non-veg food,"" said Pati, a housewife.""For the past two months onions are being sold at Rs 40 per kg and above. Last week it suddenly increased to Rs 46 and today it has gone up to Rs 50 per kg. How can a family manage with such stiff hike of essential commodities?"" asked Manisha Behera, another homemaker.On october 28, food supplies and consumer welfare minister Surya Narayan Patro had said that the prices would come down within one week after the new harvest.""The new harvest will arrive in the next one week after which the situation is likely to improve. I have also requested the Maharashtra government to supply onions to us first as our consumers are facing inconvenience,"" Patro had said.On Thursday, when asked about the prevailing situation, Patro said: ""Now procurement of all agriculture products will be made through e-procurement. So once fresh procurement orders are placed the prices are likely to drop.""Traders said the main reason behind the hike in onion prices was the loss of crop due to bad weather and the cost being high in the source states. ""On Thursday wholesale price at Nasik mandi was Rs 4,200 to Rs 4,500 per quintal. After adding transportation cost, the price in Odisha will be more than Rs 5,000 per quintal,"" said Sameer Das , a wholesale trader at Unit-I market.The prices of vegetables too are moving up. Tomato has been selling at Rs 60 per kg, broad beans at Rs 80/kg, okra for Rs 60/kg, drumsticks at Rs 200/kg and green peas for Rs 100/kg.

A kg of good quality onions now costs Rs 65-Rs 70 in Bengaluru's retail markets Decreased supply and increasing demand have sent the prices of onions and shallots (small onions) soaring, say farmers and traders. Even shallot prices have doubled; they range from Rs 160 to Rs 170 in the open market. Such a steep hike has not been witnessed in many years, say some farmers from North Karnataka, which is a major onion-producing region.On an average, Bengaluru markets receive 80 to 100 truckloads of onions daily. Now only 20 to 25 truckloads of onions are being supplied from Hubballi and parts of Andhra Pradesh, which is one-fourth of the daily requirement, according to an office-bearer of the Bangalore Onion Traders Association . As a result, a kg of onion which was available at Rs 30-40 just a week ago now costs Rs 70. And in another one week, it may cross Rs 80, fear traders.In the wholesale market, onion prices are up by 25% in the past five days at Hubballi APMC, Asia's largest wholesale market for onions. Modal prices have been hovering at Rs 3,000-Rs 5,000 per quintal depending of the onion quality, due to a delay in arrival of the fresh kharif harvest.North Karnataka districts, including Dharwad, Gadag, Koppal, Belagavi and Raichur, were meeting 75 per cent of Karnataka's onion demand. The state gets the remaining 25 per cent from Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.""Normal supply of onion is possible only after farmers take up rabi cultivation and after resumption of road communication, which may take another one or two months,'' said Wahab Mulla, general secretary, Onion and Potato Merchants Association M K Patil, a senior horticulture officer said the prices of onions are expected to stabilize as the Centre has decided to impose a minimum export price (MEP) of $850 per tonne on onions to increase domestic supply and check rising costs. They have also asked public sector body Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation (MMTC) to import 2,000 tonnes of onions in order to check prices in local markets.Market sources expect a further increase in onion prices as the supply from North Karnataka is unlikely to be resumed soon. Other vegetables whose prices have shot up during the past couple of days include carrot, coriander leaves, cauliflower, cabbage, beans and tomato."

The States need to adopt similar legislations, he pointed out.New technologiesThe legislation would also help infuse new technologies into farming so as to reduce pre and post-harvest losses.This will help whenever there is surplus production with timely storage, mainly for perishable commodities, for a short time and their transportation to places where good price is guaranteed, he said, and pointed out how onion farmers of Nasik in Maharashtra and tomato growers of Madanapalle in Andhra Pradesh were being forced to resort to distress sale whenever there was a glut situation in the market.He said NITI Aayog, the think tank of the government, had undertaken studies on how to optimise price realisation for the farmers, and praised Madhya Pradesh for its success in the implementation of price stabilisation for the farmers with timely market intervention.Value additionReferring to the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, he said the focus of the programme was to inculcate innovative spirit among the farmers, the backbone of the country, and encourage them for value addition and take up entrepreneurship by forming into a network of small farmers for collective marketing.Immense potentialAsked to comment on the future of startups in giving a boost to the rural economy, he said under the Atal Innovation Mission, a comprehensive ecosystem was being created to convince educated youth from all parts of the country to explore immense potential of warehousing, transportation, cold storage, call centres, weather forecast, and timely supply of quality seed, pesticides, and fertilizers.We are seeking the opinion of stakeholders, after which the draft Act will be enacted.

5aeb6f9f9855b73f522c996f,Rain shadow on veggie prices,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rain-shadow-on-veggie-prices/articleshow/61730261.cms,2017-11-21,,The Times Of India,"KOLKATA: Unseasonal rain that had hit Bengal last week may have receded but its impact is still being felt across Kolkata markets. While the showers are responsible for pulling down prices of a handful of vegetables , it has adversely affected the stocks of others, thereby burning a hole in consumers' pockets.Over the last few days, prices of cabbage and cauliflower have dropped sharply, thanks the low-pressure triggered rain. Wholesalers have resorted to distress sale to clear the cabbage-cauliflower stock damaged by the rain.But buyers are not so lucky when it comes to other vegetables. Prices of some staple vegetables have remained consistently at or above Rs 50/kg. This is bit unusual if you look at previous years. By this time last year, vegetable prices nosedived sharply.According to sources, rain has delayed harvesting of winter vegetables in Bengal, forcing the state to depend on other states. Consumers, subsequently, are bearing the price burden. ""Most of the winter vegetables we are now getting is coming from outside. Peyajkoli (Scallion), which is coming from Karimpur in Bangladesh , remains pricey. Tomato from Purulia has just started arriving. So, tomato price is likely to crash in two-three days,"" said Kamal Dey, Koley Market vendors association president and Bengal government's market task force member.But the showers have spelt doom for potato. After last year's bumper crop, this year was predicted to be a lean year. But the untimely rain can make it far worse. ""So, potato prices might shoot up unusually,"" said Dey.But what is most striking is the gap between wholesale and retail prices. ""Around 20% is the reasonable gap between wholesale and retail prices, if you take into account transportation cost, waste and local market levy by trading associations. But in case of most of the vegetables, the difference is between 60% and 80%,"" said Anubrata Chatterjee, an agro-retail economist.The government should put up a board at every municipal market to publicize wholesale prices so that a consumer knows whether the retail vendor is asking for too much, advised Dey. An aware consumer can always bring down the price of vegetables at a reasonable level.Last week's rain has hit the prime vegetable producing districts like South 24 Parganas, East, Bankura, Hooghly and Howrah hard. In South 24 Parganas, 8,242 hectares have been affected, followed by East Midnapore (6,984 hectares), Bankura (4,380 hectares) and Hooghly (1,544 hectares),"" said an agriculture department officer."

On Monday, onion prices increased to Rs 50 per kg at the retail market, while the wholesale price too rose to Rs 225 for 5 kg, which could further spike retail prices.Both housewives and fast food joints are at their wits' end as they are finding it difficult to get any substitute. Homemaker Pushpa said, ""Onions make us cry in the kitchen when we cut them.

5aeb75099855b73f522c9b80,"To get best spots, hawkers pay up to Rs 20,000/month to ‘seths’",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/to-get-best-spots-hawkers-pay-up-to-rs-20000/month-to-seths/articleshow/61732320.cms,2017-11-21,,The Times Of India,"MUMBAI: Whether you're a businessman buying a 2,000 sqft flat or a hawker renting 20 sqft of space illegally, nothing matters more in this city than location. Profits can vary drastically depending on where a hawker is located while fruits and vegetables sell fast in largely vegetarian localities, items like 'Chinese bhel' are a big hit around schools and colleges. And in a business district like Fort, mobile cases and earphones are always in demand.In an effort to deconstruct the world of street peddling, TOI interacted with several hawkers from across the city. Most of them admitted to paying a premium to squat illegally on a prime spot. On Bandra's Linking Road , for instance, which boasts department stores, fast-food chains and hordes of pedestrians, hawkers are willing to pay as much as Rs 20,000 per month.This money isn't used to bribe a BMC official despite the fact that the hawker is squatting on a public footpath. Instead, explains a local politician, it finds its way into the hands of local 'seths' and 'sahabs' with political connections, who have ""captured"" this location illegally and are now sub-letting it for a fee. The more the footfall in an area, the more those controlling the space demand. If a hawker is unwilling to pay, the space is immediately given to the next person in line.Irfan Chand (name changed), who sells maxi dresses, found this out two years ago when the BMC evicted him from his original spot outside Jogeshwari railway station. ""I started searching for another space, and I found this spot at Andheri , but I was told that it belongs to someone already,"" says Chand. ""I now have to pay him Rs200 every day for doing my business here.""Hawkers dot the footpaths outside railway stations because commuters have to walk to and fro, providing them with a captive clientele. BMC officials have been trying to clear these areas to reduce congestion but have found it to be an uphill task. ""The lakhs of people who travel by local trains prefer picking up fruits and vegetables on their way home instead of heading to a market,"" says a BMC official. ""This makes our job even more difficult as people patronize these hawkers."" On the other hand, hawkers complain that the BMC's eviction drives negatively impact their business.Some, however, do brisk business anyway, making as much as Rs50,000 a day. Dharmen Gupta sells imported fruit outside Santacruz railway station and earns Rs40,000 per day though he claims his profit is only Rs2,000-4,000. He explains that this is because fruits are perishable and so if they don't sell, he has to offload them on another fruit seller at the wholesale price.Food items often sell in places where there are many schools, colleges and restaurants. These lanes often become unofficial 'khau gallis'. Bandra corporator Asif Zakaria says that the KFC lane, off Bandra's Linking Road, has seen a huge spurt in the number of hawkers selling fast food even though cooking on the road is strictly prohibited. But hawkers are willing to break the law because of the spiking demand. Babloo Raja, who sits outside Dadar's St Paul's High School, remembers selling 'Chinese bhel' for Rs5 just five years ago. Now, a plate is Rs15.The price of goods and their quality also varies in different locations. At Kurla market, for instance, tomatoes sell for Rs55-60 a kg but they can't match the quality of those sold at Andheri's Lokhandwala market for Rs70. And in residential localities, hawkers have loyal customers. ""Ours is a family business. Therefore most of our customers are old- timers from the locality, says Jeetendra Tripathi, who sells fruits at Vile Parle market.(This is Part 2 of a series on hawking in Mumbai. Tomorrow: In Part 3, we tell you about the 'protection' involved in the business and the money which exchanges hands)"

CM Manohar Lal Khattar unveiled the scheme  which will be initially extended to famers growing potato, onion, tomato and cauliflower  in Karnal.Haryana director general of horticulture Arjun Saini said the schemes aim was to help farmers in distress and ensure they recover input costs. For example, if a farmer has spent Rs 400 on producing 100kg potato, he is free to sell it at any price to reap profits. However, if he fails to recover his input cost due to drop in rates, the department will compensate for the difference, he added.Saini said the cost of horticulture produce would be determined by experts from the Haryana Agriculture University, department of horticulture and Kisan Ayog. It is different from minimum support price (MSP). With this, distressed farmers growing vegetables in Haryana will no more have to throw their produce on roads in the event of a crash in prices. The idea is to encourage them to resort to diversification of crops, he said.The department clarified that farmers would be compensated only if they registered themselves on the portal and the produce was sold through the market committees using J-forms. A separate fund would be constituted by the state government for the scheme.Speaking at the inauguration of scheme, Khattar said compensation at the rate of Rs 400 per quintal would be given for tomato and potato, and the amount would be Rs 500 per quintal for onion and cauliflower.Terming the scheme as a big sham and a huge fraud on the farmers of the state, Haryana Congress legislature party leader Kiran Choudhry said the state government should fix MSP for vegetables and procure those if it was keen to help them.She added that the scheme seeking to offer input cost for four crops  potato, onion, cabbage and tomatofrom January onwards, consciously puts the cost of growing way below the cost price so that the government was not made to pay anything."

Skipping dinner and choosing to stick to just snacks is also a no-no. Avoid rotis and rice and limit your alcohol consumption to less than 100ml for a healthy start to the new year, they say.According to Debashish Saha , consultant, AMRI Hospital , green salad, non-oily snacks and non-greasy meat are perfect for having a blast on December 31 without weighing your system down. The tendency is to consume oily snacks like kebabs, fish fingers and cheese balls along with alcohol. It kills your appetite, making you skip dinner. That results in indigestion and hangover. Rather, one should pick salad or fruits if they are available. In case they are not, limit your alcohol consumption and make sure to have your dinner sans carbohydrates, said Saha.It could be a challenge to restrict alcohol consumption at a New Years party, so make sure you have the right kind of stuff to limit the negative effects, says microbiologist Irfaan Akhtar. It is important to know your limits. While its important not to consume alcohol on an empty stomach, dont stuff yourself with food either. Dry snacks and non-spicy dishes should be chosen. Diabetics and cardiac patients should avoid whisky and opt for red wine instead. It is important to go slow on starters since one often ends up having too much protein in a short span of time. This could affect the kidneys, said Akhtar.However, more than the food or drink, it is often hand hygiene that leaves party-hoppers sick the next morning, points out Arindam Biswas, consultant, RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences.Biswas added that some myths about preventing hangovers needed to be busted. Cheese or lime water doesnt help. In fact, it could lead to severe indigestion the next morning. Rather, take peanuts, lettuce, cabbage leaves, tomatoes and cucumber. Make sure to have plenty of water the next morning and you should be ready to swing into action, he says."

But whats happening in Pune is real.The ride from my home in Anandnagar to SNDT College was a troubled one, said 22-year old Shivani Mirajkar It was not the usual traffic mess that was testing her nerves but was the small insects that were getting into her eyes throughout the ride. I had to stop several times on the way to rub my eyes. It occurred to me after sometime that I could prevent the insects from getting into my eyes by pulling down the visor of my helmet, she said.For the past two days, the tiny insects are clouding thoroughfares such as Sinhagad Road, Paud Road, Congress Bhavan road and F C Road.Mangesh Kavtekar said the constant bumping of the insects on his helmet visor not only annoyed him, but also was a major distraction during his ride from Paud Road.It felt like someone was spraying my visor with dot-like objects. It was annoying and a big distraction. I constantly wondered what they are. I also had to slow down, as I could not pay attention to where I was heading to, he said.Senior zoologist Hemant Ghate identified the distraction as aphid  a tiny greenish translucent-winged insect.The insects are seen around in a minor swarm. Aphids are plant bugs. The insects usually take to the wings when the temperature is warm, particularly during winter. There are hundreds of species of the insect and it is not easy to identify them in a short time, he said.Various species of aphids affect crop plants such as soybean and tomato. In nature, there are also predators of these tiny insects. Ladybird beetles feed on eggs and the wingless forms of the aphids, Ghate said, adding that the presence of these insects will be felt for the next two days."

Almost 49,000 children are affected by malnutrition in the district. The district which adds immensely to the overall sugarcane produce has been lagging in production of cash crops like pulses and vegetables, forcing the farmers to procure it at higher rates from the market.In the new scheme of things, department will promote mixed farming with impetus on farming of vegetables and pulses in tandem with sugarcane. On pilot basis, 22,000 hectare has been identified where mixed farming is being practiced.According to statistics, provided by district programme office, there are around 3.39 lakh children in the district. Of these, while 49,000 are malnourished and around 20,000 children are acutely malnourished. These kids are from 0 to 5 years old. Besides this, women are also suffering from anemia.According to official, it is because of increase in sugarcane cultivation area. In west UP, including Bijnor , farmers had almost sidelined other crops. Most of the farmers are growing only sugarcane.The district cane officer OP Singh said, We have assigned a target of sowing 22,000 hectare intercrop in sugarcane. Earlier, Bijnor district is a hub of sugarcane crop. Farmers have adopted it as a main crop as it is a cash crop and does not require much labourer. On our suggestion, the farmers have started growing some crops like cauliflower, bringal, tomato, capsicum, radish, salgum, gram, ourad, mong, masoor with sugarcane crop.Director of agriculture department, JP Chaudhary , said, The initiative will help improve the health of malnourished kids and women in the district. We are holding meetings in every village and motivating the farmers. Efforts will start bearing fruits soon."

We get raw or rotten tomatoes mixed with good quality ones, she pointed out.Till August, tomatoes prices kept rising and hit Rs 100 a kg. Until two weeks ago, they were sold for Rs 40-50 a kg.Rates at Hopcoms (Horticulture Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society) stores were at Rs 10 a kg on Sunday.The reason behind the drop in prices is good rain that the state received this year. This led to a larger crop, said wholesalers. The supply has increased from tomato-growing districts like Chikkballapur, Kolar and Mandya. We cant store the crop as it is a perishable commodity. We expect the prices to remain the same for the next two weeks, said R V Gopi, president, City Market Vegetable Merchants Association.Tomato is grown on about 59,000 hectares across state. Kolar district grows tomato on 17,000 hectares of land.Mohammad Manjur Ahmad, a vegetable vendor from Munireddypalya, said, The increased yield leads to wastage of stock. We cant store them and we are not able to sell all of it in a day. We buy it at Rs 15 a kg from wholesalers but are forced to retail at Rs 10 a kg.Another vegetable vendor from Shivajinagar, Imran Khan said, Though tomatoes sell more than any other fruit or vegetable, the high supply has pushed the prices down.

An equivalent of this popular scene from Yash Chopras Kala Patthar (1979) is playing out simultaneously in a car at a drive-in theatre with don Raees (Shah Rukh Khan) ordering a mill owner to give the neighbourhood workers their rightful wages.Its a scene that puts in a nutshell one of the many things that Rahul Dholakia is trying to do with SRK in Raees  making him play a version of the Angry Young Man of the 70s and the 80s. Quite like Big Bs Vijay, Raees is anti-establishment, an outlaw and also a Robin Hood figure.Raees is the Vijay of Gujarat where business is so paramount that even prohibition leads to its own illicit trade shoot-offs, where bootlegging is a strong commercial force thriving on a political nexus. The subversive streak is visible right from the start when the voiceover says  pabandi bagawat ki shuruaat hoti hai (imposing restrictions leads to rebellion). Where there is a will there has to be a way. So you have alcohol-shot tomatoes on sale and liquor consumed in tea cups.Along with all of this, Dholakia also channels the early dark avatars of SRK  in Baazigar and Darr . But what is most interesting is how he sets up Raees within a religious and community context.In Raees, SRK and Dholakia would rather dare than play it safe. The character, ostensibly based on the life of criminal Abdul Latif, walks on the razors edge. Its a complicated portrayal. Some would complain of a whitewash regarding the alleged Dawood and Mumbai blast linkages. But it is in line with grounding SRK in his faith, and making him rise above it.We begin with a person who puts business above religion and doesnt intend to harm others. Betrayals lead him to cross over to the dark side. More severe transgressions  like encouraging rioting and violence  follow. Yet he is also the  masiha  (messiah) who feeds the needy and affected.He is parallel government to the community. Yet he is not a superman, a man who uses the system as much as he is used; who kills yet cries at his failure to provide housing to his community. Raees is more of a Shakespearean tragic hero, so is his fall. The moral compass remains intact; transgressions are not denied. There is no escaping guilt either.  Mohalla bachate bachate shehar jala diya (In trying to save the neighbourhood I set the town afire, he says.The adversary, cop Jaideep Ambalal Majmudar (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), gets an equal play. Its a cat-and-mouse game between equals. In fact, with his poker-faced humour, sharp lines and Michael Jackson entry, Siddiqui gets to play to the gallery more than SRK himself and remains one up on him throughout. There are some nice touches, like Majmudar snooping on the love chat between Raees and his wife. He is human after all. The supporting cast shines. One only wishes there was more of Sheeba Chaddha and Loveleen Mishra.If it is Gujarat, can Gandhi be far behind? Early on in the film, there is a lovely scene of Raees stealing a pair of spectacles from the Gandhi statue because he cant afford to buy a frame for himself. The doctor asks him to put the glasses back on the statue and gives him another pair, a pair that eventually comes to stand for entirely the opposite of Gandhis vision of non-violence. A messiah lost to the people, the state and a nation.

That will barely cover the transport, hammali (porter) and mandi charges, said Hukumchand Makwana, a farmer from Piplu village, about 70 km from Indore.We have to pay labourers and also need money for paying interest on debt besides running our households. So we have no option but to sell our produce at low rates, said farmer Shantilal Chawra who has been staying at the mandi premises for past three days to sell his green peas, whose prices have come down to Rs 5 per kg, less than the input costs.The demand-supply equation has also turned against the farmers as production of seasonal vegetables has increased whereas people have tightened their purses.When asked about the support provided by the mandi administration after demonetisation, commission agent Ashok Bhilware said they have been left to fend for themselves.Commission agents act as a link between farmers and wholesale traders to keep the vegetable supply chain running and often lend money to farmers.Small farmers need cash for their daily requirements. Nowadays, there is liquidity crisis but farmers supplying vegetable do not accept cheques, he said.Officials told HT that no directive to provide special facilities to vegetable farmers has come from Bhopal.We have not received any such directive (to talk to the banks about providing cash vans or give transport subsidy) so far from the state government, Praveen Verma, deputy director, MP State Agricultural Marketing Board, Indore region, said.Choithram mandi in-charge B B S Tomar could not be reached for comment despite visit to his office, repeated calls and text messages.WOES MOUNTPrices of potatoes, onions, and seasonal vegetables including tomatoes and green peas have crashed.Transportation costs are increasing due to rise in fuel costs. On top of that farmers have to pay to hammals (porters) and also pay mandi charges. So in some cases, they have been unable to recover even the input costs.Facilities announced by the government including cash vans and transport subsidy have not been implemented"

The village has a population of 320 people and they are dependent only on agriculture.Villagers complain that in the past one decade or so, attacks by monkeys and wild boars in their agriculture land have made things difficult. We keep guarding fields from monkeys during day and from wild boars during night, said Negi.Farming in hills is shrinking fast and farmers losing interest in it. Besides attacks by monkeys and wild boars, farmers facing problem due to lack of irrigation facility. Farming in hills is rain fed and canals are limited to some pockets.In Doon Dwara, villagers have either stopped or growing limited crops like millets, oats, vegetables like cucumber, tomatoes, potatoes etc.Shyam Singh, another farmer, said monkeys destroy vegetables while wild boars destroy potato fields. We are left with very little options, Singh said.Farming in hills has become a non-profitable entity. Government figure shows that agriculture land came down from 7.91 lakh hectares in 2009-10 to 7.41 lakh in 2011-12.Half of the states agricultural land falls in four districts of Dehradun, Nainital, Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar in plains and rest is shared by nine hill districts.Prakash Dimri, another farmer, said: 2,200 is the average cost that comes on sowing in an area of 0.02 hectares or 1 nali while the return is not more than 1,500.The land holdings are tiny and which are getting further fragmented over time. 87% farming in hills is rain fed while only 13% has irrigation facility, said Vijay Jardhari, an agro expert.Change in the climate pattern is also a big concern, rain cycle is no more regular thus farmers are left with little choice, he said.Jardhari said farmers must continue with millets since it survives drought like condition and give handsome returns. He, however, is clueless on providing solutions to farmers who were not growing millets owing to threat from wild animals.Due to growing population of monkeys, acres of arable land left untilled and agriculture activities have almost reduced to vicinity of houses in the villages.Villagers in Thano in the outskirts of Dehradun are trying to grow crops such as ginger, turmeric, bitter gourd and lady finger that usually monkeys dont eat.People in Balori village that falls in Pauri district have passed a resolution asking the district administration to either drive away monkeys or vasectomise them.The forest department is entrusted with the task of catching monkeys but it is confined to urban areas. In February 2016, the department gave permission with riders to kill the wild boars affecting farming in hills.Killing wild boars is not an easy task. In the absence of trained hunters, the order is meaningless said Ratan Aswal of village Mirchoda."

The programme started in December last year and germination has begun in the area, the state horticulture department said. It added that the crop will be ready by February.Usually, this area gets vegetables around April, but by using this technology we can get vegetables by February. This will also meet the demand (for vegetables), said Deen Mohammad Khan, district horticulture officer, Gurgaon.The horticulture department said it has plans to extend the programme to crops affected by a bad monsoon too. It could stabilise the prices that go up every year around the time due to disrupted supply.Under this method, tunnels are dug within five to six feet of each other and soil preparation is done before sowing, which started in December.We have sowed cucumber, melons, watermelons, bitter gourds, squashes and snake gourds that are easy to grow in these tunnels. The low tunnels get better sunlight, ventilation and get water through drip irrigation. The tunnels are suitable for growing tomatoes, cucumbers and melons, said Khan.In one acre, a farmer can earn Rs2.5 to Rs3 lakh per harvest and the setup can be used for three years without tilling the land, he added.The mulching procedure involves simple techniques to create the tunnels. Bamboo sticks are tied to plastic sheets in a semi-circular structure to support the growing vegetable. Another plastic sheet is then placed on the structure to trap sunlight inside and create an optimal temperature for the crop to grow. The covered layer also reduces water loss and eliminates growth of weeds.At present, 160 farmers are with us in this programme. Our target is to increase this number by five times to serve the entire population of Gurgaon, said Khan."

As a result, prices of vegetables will be high till Durga Puja, said a member of Hatibagan Bazar Byabsayi Samiti advisory committee, Abhijit Saha, to The Indian Express.Saha also said procuring vegetables from wholesale markets has not been easy in recent days.We are not getting enough vegetables from wholesale markets. Farmers who have already stored the vegetables are unable to send them due to the flood, he added.The price of tomatoes is hovering around Rs 90 to Rs 100 per kg, rising from Rs 60 to Rs 70 a few days earlier. The price of brinjal (eggplant) has gone up to Rs 40 to Rs 50 per kg, while earlier it was around Rs 20 to Rs 30. The price of cucumber went up to Rs 60 per kg, which vegetable sellers had earlier sold at Rs 30 per kg.During monsoon season, the prices of vegetables get higher, and there was no exception this year. However, the recent flood in several districts has forced prices to go up further. With the situation persisting, the prices of vegetables will not come down soon, said Rabindranath Koley, general secretary of Forum of Traders Organisation of Paschimbanga (FTOP).The general secretary of Maniktala Market, Prabhat Das, agreed with the prediction.In this kind of situation, the prices of vegetables go up automatically, he said.

Madurai Central Market Association secretary G Thiagarajan said that the tomato supply was high this year due to the good rainfall during the cultivation season. If there is no rain this winter during the harvest season, not just tomatoes but even onions, which have been hovering at more than Rs 100 per kilogram for the last six months, will come down to about Rs 20 or less, he said.President of the Central Market Association, R S P Sekhar said that the supplies had dropped to about 4,000 boxes of 15 kilograms each in November this year, but suddenly there was a surge and on Friday, when 7,000 to 8,000 boxes of tomatoes arrived at the market.A box of 15 kilograms was sold at Rs 70 on Friday and is expected to go down further, he said. The wholesale price for the tomato is Rs 5 to 6 based on the quality of the fruit. Traders say that a cold storage facility would help them to conserve the fruits at least for a day or two when there is excess supply, failing which they have to throw away the damaged or crushed fruit, which will start rotting immediately.While the market had depended on supplies of tomatoes and onions from the other states about a month ago to meet the demand, now local supply has become plentiful. K Palaniyandi a farmer from Dindigul said that there was a good harvest this time, but it would not fetch them a good profit, as they had to sell the picked fruits and traders named their price.Meanwhile, retailers are selling tomatoes at Rs10 a kilogram, in many parts of the city. We need a margin of atleast Rs 4 otherwise we do not make any profit, said Sankarapandian of Anna Nagar."

MukeshOUT OF ORDER: The defunct cold storage at Tamar near Ranchi. Picture by Manob ChowdharyRanchi: The shabby building on the edge of NH-33 in Tamar block of Ranchi is a cruel reminder of what the state government could have done to help residents of what is called the vegetable bowl of Jharkhand.It is meant to be a cold storage facility. Only, it never worked. If it did farmers would not have to routinely dump their produce, primarily tomatoes, on the highway every year between January and March because of low demand and poor prices.""Last year, I had to throw away over 40kg of tomatoes on the road. Wholesalers were offering me a meagre 50 paise per kg while tomatoes were selling in retail markets for more than Rs 7 a kg,"" Jagdish Mahto, a farmer from nearby Bundu, told The Telegraph.Mahto, who threw away his produce in utter frustration and even staged a protest in Ranchi along with other farmers, said he did notice the building. ""I have been seeing it for the last six years but the cold storage never worked. It would have been a boon for us had it started.""Built on 10,000 sq feet on the banks of Kurkuri river in Tamar, around 60km from Ranchi, today, the facility peeps out of trees, frozen in time; a symbol of government apathy towards farmers. The local BDO had no idea and the agriculture department was quick to dismiss suggestions that it had anything do with it.Finally, after being redirected to various departments, The Telegraph zeroed in on Ranchi district welfare officer Arun Manjhi who conceded they were the custodians of the defunct cold storage in Tamar. But he couldn't throw any light on its future.Tribal welfare commissioner Gauri Shankar Minz vaguely recalled its construction, but couldn't say why it wasn't working. ""I will have to check the files. I will take appropriate action,"" he promised.BDO Maruti Minz said he was new to Tamar. ""I have been posted at Tamar for two years but the cold storage was built earlier. I don't have the files, hence don't know anything,"" he said.Chairman of the horticulture department at Birsa Agriculture University K.K. Jha said a cold storage in Tamar would have helped farmers of Ranchi, Seraikela-Kharsawan and East Singhbhum districts who also grow cauliflower, cabbage, beans and ladyfinger.""A cold storage is particularly helpful for tomatoes as these don't last more than a day or two. Tomatoes are grown across Jharkhand, often produced in excess,"" he said.State horticulture director Rajiv Kumar said Jharkhand produced 40 lakh tonne vegetables against an annual requirement of 28 lakh tonne.""We are focusing on cold storages,"" he said. ""Last year, we sanctioned one each in Dhanbad, Bokaro and Giridih. Two more have been proposed in Sahebganj and Deoghar,"" he said."

As the government will not be in a position to announce a waiver at least for a few months, it has swung into action to ensure the indebted farmers are not hassled in getting a loan for seeds, fertilisers and pesticides essential for sowing, which will begin in first week of June, immediately after monsoon sets in. The government is thinking of purchasing seeds and fertilisers and distribute them with the help of NGOs and social organisations.The Opposition has been batting for a loan waiver for farmers similar to the one given in Uttar Pradesh. The Congress, NCP and four smaller parties boycotted proceedings of the Assemblys budget session for three weeks to push the demand. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had declared that his government, too, was in favour of the waiver, but at an appropriate time. He said his government was studying the UP model of a waiver. He also said that rather than a waiver, the thrust would be on sustainable development of agriculture.To reduce expenditure on farm labourers, the government is mulling funding them from the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS). We have not been able to fully utilise the central funds allocated under NREGS, but on the other hand, the cost of farm labourers is unbearable for farmers. By funding farm labour, we can extend a great relief to the farmers helping them to reduce cost of production. Similarly, on other fronts, too, we are tapping the possibilities to extend the benefits to the farmers, said an official from the agriculture department.The cooperation department is planning to restructure the loans given to the farmers to enable them to get fresh loans for the kharip season. The government is also considering health, education and housing schemes in the package so that the socio-economic burden is reduced.It will be a package of various schemes by 3 to 4 departments to ensure farmers are heavily subsidised to bring farming to the level of affordability. Right from testing of the soil health, sufficient supply of water, power supply at subsidised rates to effective marketing of the agriculture products, we are planning to do everything that will minimise the gap between the production cost and the rate in the market, Subhash Deshmukh, cooperation minister, told HT.The government is also tapping the idea of bring about 22 crops in the list of produce with minimum support price. It will bear the cost of difference between the market price and the MSP, particularly for crops such as tomato, onion and grapes, whose rates have fallen this year. Our aim is to bring cost of production to zero for about 1.07 lakh farmers who hold less than 5 acres of land. Instead of giving them money, the government will purchase the things required to cultivate and distribute with the help various organisations working in the sector, the officer said.According to rough estimates, the schemes will cost around Rs10,000 crore if implemented. But the estimates are primary, and depends on the feasibility of the all schemes being tapped. The schemes could be implemented if the government wins over the demand of the loan waiver, which is expected to cost Rs30,500 crore. But it succumbed to pressure for the waiver. It will have to cut short the schemes, another official from the cooperation department said.Read: Sangharsh Yatra: Waive loan before farmers lose patience, say Maharashtra opposition leadersMaharashtra Opposition intensifies attacks on govt, kicks off second Sangharsh Yatra for farm loan waiver"

Students are given lectures thrice a week on how to maintain the garden by urban farming groups like Start Upcycling Now (SUN) and iKheti, which helped the school to set up the garden.The project started in July 2016 after Father Gregory, the schools manager, roped in 240 students of Class 8 and explained the idea. Fascinated by the idea of having their own garden, the students immediately swung into action. Each class is divided into four sections and each division was assigned four gardens each.In a concrete jungle like Mumbai, a terrace garden awakens a sense of environmental consciousness and becomes a forum for knowledge. It also provides a variety of organic and fresh vegetables right at your doorstep, said Father Gregory.He added that a special period has been dedicated for the students to do the gardening work, which includes watering the plants, planting new vegetables, adding soil and compost or removing saplings, everything is done in the Work Experience period once a week.To execute the project, students created soil beds using clay bricks. A plastic sheet was spread on the brick base to prevent water from seeping through. Later, seven inch thick soil layer is spread on the plastic and is mixed with mulch comprising shredded cardboard and dry leaves. This helps soil to retain moisture even on the hot days.We should not just teach students phrases, but also make them apply those in real life. This is their real education. Now, they are so involved in it that they even utilise their recess time nurturing the plants, said Gracy Solomon, principal, OLPS.StudentspeakCommenting on the initiative, Razeen Sayyed, 13, said, We (each division) get 30 minutes with our respective gardens during which we must ensure that everything is fine with the crop. If everything is okay, and we are left with some time, we make self-irrigation bottles.The terrace garden produces brinjals, tomatoes, ladies fingers (okra), lemon grass, lemons and carom seeds (ajwain), which is appreciated not only by their treachers but also the monkeys who visit the garden in search of fresh vegetables.Monkeys eat our entire tomato crop. So to keep them at bay, we installed a scare crow, said Aaradhya Patil, 13.On each patch of garden, there are boards with information on the plants and their uses. For example, pentas plant is used as a popular medicine in malaria and lime to relieve asthma.Kids should understand how the plants are grown from scratch and that even a day of not watering can take away all their hard work, said Priyanka Shah, founder, iKheti, adding In this way, they also learn to respect food and become sensitive towards the environment.Organic fertilisersThe compost that they use in the garden comes from the waste created in the school campus. The school has eight drums in a set of four for each division where they dump organic waste, which is later used as fertiliser.Students do all the legwork they can for the environment. Aerobic composting is something that you just have to dump it and almost everything else is taken care of the microorganisms. The students of the school make sure that no waste goes out to the dump yard from the school, said Natasha DCosta, SUN founder.After the crop comes to fruition, the saplings are handed over to the students. Sanket Gauri, a student of Class VIII, said, We showed it to our parents and friends, and now even they want to be a part of it. My neighbours liked it so much that they want to start gardening on our terrace as well.The students are not just young environmentalists, but they are exceptional in studies as well. They recently won a Science Club Competition last year.My favourite subject is Maths, but this [terrace gardening] is Science, Chemistry, Geography and all other subjects put to practice, said Essakkimuthu Konar, 14, as he held his self-irrigation bottle with his name labelled on it.Also read: Teen powers change, helps buildings, schools recycle 350 kg of batteries"

Ask Those Who Voted for Modi",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/where-are-the-achhe-din-ask-those-who-voted-for-modi/story-zSkharcZSfHdLRtDtwd5UJ.html,2017-02-05,,Hindustan Times,"Rocking the youngest of his five children in his arms, street vendor Daata Ram watches his wife tend to two sick cows whose milk once supplemented their meagre income.The 66-year-olds family of seven survives on what he now makes by selling small quantities of puffed rice in Pandra Sikanpur, a one-street, hardscrabble town of 5,000 in Uttar Pradesh.I took a loan of Rs 30,000 to buy those cows but I think they are no good now, says Ram, who uses a fourth of his monthly earnings of Rs5000-6000 to repay the local moneylender.Across the street from Rams thatched hut is the sprawling house of Neeraj Kumar Singh, a well-off sugarcane farmer who lost multiple crops to back-to-back droughts three years ago, and then suffered when farm prices crashed last year.It takes two harvesting seasons to recover the loss of one, says Singh who wants his sons to find jobs outside farming so that their lives wouldnt be held ransom to the vagaries of nature.But his four children have found no jobs, and the 60-year-old farmer is angry that he must now divide his 10 acres of cropland to secure their future.Daata Ram and Singh sit on different points on the countrys income spectrum but, in their collective discontent, the two symbolise the rising pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to deliver on his emotive election vow to bring achhe din, or good times, to Indians.The Feb. 1 budget was a chance for Modi to unveil measures that would fulfil his 2014 guarantee of growth and more jobs, a task made all the more tough by his abrupt decision to drain out 86% of all cash in the economy in his fight against illicit wealth.Its also a challenge that is urgent, given that Modi has already crossed the halfway point of his tenure.Read | Budget 2017: Akhilesh says BJP could not fulfil promise of achhe dinTo his admirers, though, Modi has already made great strides  from reinvigorating the ossified hand of a government system that hobbled progress to biting the bullet on tough decisions needed to pull Indias economy out of a dangerous morass.Many of his moves on inclusive, accountable governance and a freer hand to bureaucracy have resonated well with Indians tired of a rudderless government mired in corruption scandals and whose indecisiveness had left more than 700 major industry projects in limbo.Rambir Rathi , a Uttar Pradesh farmer at home (Vipin Kumar/HT PHOTO)Growing economySome of that good work is showing.The countrys annualised retail inflation is below the mid-point of the central banks target; public finances are better than before with higher income from taxes, monsoon-sown grain production is the highest in at least 14 years and the economy is more open to business than it has ever been. In its first two years, the government cleared more economic reforms  including deregulating diesel prices, cutting cooking gas subsidy and making it easier for companies to exit business  than in the last five years of the previous government. Millions more have been brought into the countrys banking system and the government has pushed digitisation.In the latest budget, the government also announced incentives to labour-intensive sectors such as clothing and leather along with spending more on projects like roads, railways, low-cost housing and irrigation.I will give the Prime Minister two out of 10. Even 2 seems two much. I feel like giving only one. Modis foreign policy is good . The one point is just for that.But Modis critics say much of this is old wine in a new bottle, minor cosmetic tweaks that havent put India on the path of a paradigm shift the prime minister had promised.Economic growth hasnt created enough jobs because of lack of investment, income inequality has grown, farm distress has soared and the cash ban has only worsened the economic outlook in the immediate term. Credit to industry remains flat and, despite higher farm credit target, disbursement levels have dipped as banks seek to avoid bad loans.Even for some Modi fans like Rambir Rathi, a sugarcane farmer in Uttar Pradeshs Baghpat, the dream of achhe din is coming unstruck.I voted for Modi. Farmers like us were promised Rs 500 for a quintal of sugarcane instead of the Rs 315 we were receiving then. I believed in him, says the father of two.They told us our dues would be paid by the sugar mill owners but look what has happened. The rate is the same. Our dues remain unpaid.Asked to rate Modis governance of more than two years, Rathi gives the prime minister two on 10.Do bhi jyada hai. Mann toh nahin karta hai ek bhi dene ko (Even two is too much. I dont feel like giving him even one), he says, adding Modi had only done well on dealing with Pakistan.But farms in distressWith mounting debt, poverty, increasing health cost and other ballooning farming-related expenses, farm incomes dropped 50%-70% over the past years. And just farmers hoped to claw back from two years of back-to-back drought, the government ordered a disruptive currency ban that squeezed the largely cash-only agriculture sector.Farm prices crashed as farmers dumped tomatoes and potatoes onto the streets, fed unharvested crop to cattle and farm hands sat idle. A farm loan write-off for two months after demonetisation hardly helped, some economists say.Februarys budget raised the farm credit target to by 11.1% to Rs 10-lakh crore in 2017-18 but, in reality, bank lending to farmers has dropped and the distribution of credit has focussed on a handful of relatively better-off states.Expenditure on agriculture is seen rising marginally to Rs 2.06-lakh crore in 2017/18, but this in real terms might signal a decline.Fewer jobsSigns of distress are clear in cities as well. Sharp rises in education and healthcare costs in the last two years have hit Indias burgeoning middle class hard, denting Modis popularity among the relatively well-off.Today, India stands before a unique moment in history: It could choose to squander its immense potential with its antiquated socio-political system, corruption and flighty business rules or build on its cultural heritage, democratic values and a young demography to transform the lives of its 1.25 billion citizens.To begin with, two decades on, nothing less than a $10 trillion economy will secure Indias future, says a recent study by Pricewaterhouse Coopers( PwC). It will have to create jobs on a scale that can absorb 10-12 million people who join the workforce every year, including members of the emerging middle class  a billion strong by 2034.Read | Achhe din will come only after 2019, Cong working on it: Rahul GandhiBut only 135,000 jobs were created in 2015 -- the lowest total in seven years and 67% lower than the number created in the last year of the previous government. In one quarter of 2016-17, for which official data is available, only 77,000 jobs were created  and of these 50,000 were government jobs.The gloom is affecting the youth.Chartered accountant Omprakash Sethia in Bhopal.

It seems there is no monitoring system in the country. I am hugely disappointed, says Omprakash Sethia of Bhopal.I thought there would be a boom on the job front but despite emphasis on digital India I dont see many job avenues, says Subhanshu Sethia, a commerce student in Bhopal.The demonetisation move worsened the plight of the vulnerably placed in the labour market in several ways, the most stress arising out of closure of establishments in the informal sector.Back in Pandra Sikanpur, Singh says he will think twice about voting for Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the next general elections scheduled for 2019.That view is far from universal, but is already on the radar of a government, which swept to power with promises of economic reforms and pro-business policies that appealed to aspirational Indians living in big towns and cities.Modi has already started turning his attention to the hinterlands. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley this month said the government will spend a record amount on rural areas and farming to help double farmers income by 2022.But Singh is unimpressed.Narendra Modi stressed on jobs during his speeches in general election. Where are those jobs? he asks.I know how I feel is how many many more Indians feel.(With inputs from Ranjan Srivastava and Sumanta Ray Chaudhuri)"

The commission also expected a status report within six weeks on supply of piped water, especially at the villages, where incidents of the kidney diseases had been identified.The number of the diseased will be known once the government submits the status report.The commission has, in its order, further directed the state health department to report within four weeks as to whether dialysis machines have been provided to the hospitals at the blocks with all infrastructure facilities.Official sources said the district administration had, in February 2011, conducted investigations in the blocks with rural water supply and sanitation wing twice following media reports. But, the cause behind the incidents of kidney diseases could not be ascertained.Investigations by the Indian Council of Medical Research's Regional Medical Research Centre had indicated that contamination of land by minerals and industrial effluents or fertilisers and pesticides could possibly be the reason behind the disease.A team from the centre had, in April 2012, undertaken epidemiological investigation into the reported cases of kidney failures.""People at these villages depend on farming for their livelihood. Since the villages are situated adjacent to the Mahanadi riverbank as well as foothill areas, the land is likely to have minerals and industrial effluent contamination via river water from the upland areas. Besides, people grow vegetables such as cabbage, beans, brinjal, tomatoes and legumes. Consumption of pulses and legumes is apparently higher. Use of fertilisers and pesticides are also prevalent risk in this area,"" the centre report had said."

Its good to dump our crop on the road, he said.While some farmers blamed it on demonetisation and cash crunch, Shajapur mandi secretary Rajesh Mishra dismissed the allegations, saying high supply and low demand had caused the prices to fall.The Madhya Pradesh government had announced facilities such as cash vans and transport subsidy for farmers to face cash crunch, but farmers claimed they are yet to receive them.According to sources, the daily supply of tomatoes at Shajapur mandi is around 200 to 300 crates as many farmers are sending their crop directly to Bhopal and Indore markets.They claimed that the rates were decent at Indore and Bhopal mandis."

Farmers of Bhandra, Kero, Kuru and Senha blocks of Lohardaga district and in Ranchi and other parts of the country Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradeshhave been dumping their tomatoes, onions and French beans.Huge dumps of vegetables were seen along Ranchi-Tata highway (NH-33) near Bhuinyadih vegetable market in Ranchis Tamar block after having been forced to sell their produce at throwaway prices because of bumper crop and cash crunch.The National Institution for Transforming India (Niti) Aayog in a recent paper admitted to the slump in vegetable prices, but attributed it to the bumper crop and not demonetisation of Rs 500/1000 notes.We are in catch-22 situation.

West Bengal traders are not coming to buy vegetables from Jharkhand at this time, said Nakul Mahato, a vegetable grower from Ranchis Pithoria area, who also sells vegetables to West Bengal.State horticulture director Rajiv Kumar said Jharkhand recorded bumper crops this year. So, it is natural the demand will fall.

The trend will continue till Chhath as many people will only consume vegetarian dishes during the course of the festival.Residents, however, are feeling the pinch of the price rise - a pair of cauliflowers available for Rs 50 now costs Rs 100. Similarly, bottle gourd, which was available for Rs 20 a piece, now costs Rs 40 per kg. Even the price of onion has gone up from Rs 20 per kg to Rs 45 per kg.Be it pointed gourd, bitter gourd, sponge gourd, ladies finger, brinjal, tomato or potato, the price of all the vegetables have soared. The most expensive among them is coriander which now stands at Rs 400 per kg.On the sudden price rise, Bablu, a vegetable seller at Rajapur Pul vegetable market, said: ""The price of vegetables has increased just before Diwali and it will continue till Chhath. It is not in our hands as we are also purchasing it at higher prices so we do not have any option but to sell at higher rates to make up the margin.""People who are involved in wholesale business are responsible for charging unnecessary money as they know very well that residents have no other option but to purchase at higher rates.Residents, naturally, expressed pain over the price-rise.Richa Kumari, a housewife at the Boring Canal Road locality, said: ""Pointed gourd which was available at Rs 20 per kg now costs Rs 40 per kg. Similarly, the price of sponge gourd and ladies finger has equally jumped. In the winter season, we love coriander sauce and it is really expensive; a little bit of coriander is not enough to make sauce. God knows when the prices will come down.""Agriculture department deputy director and agriculture expert Anil Kumar Jha, however, said the reason behind the sudden rise in vegetable price is the transition period.""This is the time when summer is on its last lap and winter is approaching. Because of this, the seasonal vegetable is getting over and fresh vegetables are coming into the market. It is actually a transition period when the supply of vegetables is less. Once winter vegetables fully reach the market, the prices will automatically go down."" Jha told The Telegraph.He also admitted that the traders intentionally increase the price to make more money during the festive season specially Chhath as many people abstain from eating non-veg."

Picture by Anirban ChoudhuryAlipurduar: A project funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) to boost collective farming systems for marginal and tenant cultivators by focusing on improved water management and irrigation practices has started yielding results.The project, started by the Uttar Bongo Krishi Vishwavidyalaya in 2014 and covering women among the marginal farmers, identified two villages in north Bengal - Dhaolaguri in Cooch Behar and Uttar Chakoakheti in Alipurduar district.Another highlight of the scheme was to minimise crop damage from elephants. The researchers suggested the cultivation of mustard, something the jumbos do not like, and now large numbers of farmers have taken to the crop.Each village is divided into three sites under the project to promote collective farming and mutual benefit-sharing. As part of the scheme, social mobilisation is also fostered through a series of community meets, group discussions and gender-awareness sessions held from time to time.An annual review meeting of the project was held on Tuesday in Alipurduar. Twenty delegates from four countries, including scientists from Uttar Bango Krishi Visya Vidyalaya, were present at the review.Addressing a news conference, Rupak Sarkar, a professor of the Krishi Vishwavidyalaya, said: ""The ACIAR provided (Australian) $82,000 for the five-year project. The project was started in 2014 and we identified these two villages (Dhaolaguri and Chakoakheti). In the eastern Gangetic plains (which covers Bengal), marginal and tenant farmers play a crucial role in ensuring food security and socio-economic uplift,"" Sarkar said.""A big challenge is to empower such marginal and tenant farmers by improving water-use efficiency. The project mainly helps farmers to produce crops during the dry season and teach them how to use water scientifically for cultivation,"" Sarkar added.According to the professor, the project also promotes ""protected cultivation"" and last year, farmers cultivated vegetables in polyhouse - enclosures made of transparent hardened polythene sheets - successfully and profitably. Crops under the project include summer paddy, wheat, maize, mustard, winter vegetables like potato, cabbage, cauliflower, garlic, chilli, and tomatoes.""We are creating awareness among villagers regarding the benefits they could enjoy from government schemes. We have given shallow tube-wells with pumpsets and polyhouses. More important, in three sites, we have set up pumpsets run by solar energy. They are cost-effective. Otherwise, the villagers have to carry diesel over 7km (from the nearest fuel outlet),"" Sarkar said.Mustard crops have helped too. ""Last year, we saw that elephants do not eat mustard and this year many farmers are cultivating it. At the same time, we will intimate forest officials (about crop damage) as elephant depredation is on the increase.""Erik Schmidj, the project in-charge from Australia, visited the area on Monday. ""We are initiating similar projects in Bihar (Madhubani district), Nepal and Bangladesh. We are satisfied with the progress of the project (in the two north Bengal areas) and we have another two years to go (for the five-year pl;an). Our plan is to motivate the villagers to get the benefits,"" Schmidj said.""Famers are innovative and it is a community-based project. Our plan is to spread the benefits from the two villages (Dhaolaguri and Chakoakheti) to other areas. Now the villagers can cultivate three to four crops in a year instead of only one in a year earlier,"" Schmidj added.Suren Chikbaraik, a farmer of Uttar Chakoakheti, said he and others "" earlier cultivated only rice"". ""But from last year, we are cultivating at least four crops in a year.""Chikbaraik added: Elephant depredation was a daily phenomena in the village and they used to damage crops. Last year, we cultivated mustard. We saw that the elephant damage wheat plants but do not touch the mustard in the adjacent field. Now we cultivate vegetables in polyhouse and even in winter also."""

To begin with, there are these walkers, invariably chattering on their cellphone, as they keep rambling all over the walkway, like uncontrolled wheels, trundling from a hilltop. Actually, there are many like them, who, like slithering serpents, walk in zigzag manner, blocking themselves and others, too.Then there are those, splaying hands and flailing their arms sideways, reminding you of birds, ready to take off on flights. Some try walking, flapping only their fingers, as if they are drumming on invisible dholaks. You also see those walkers with hands stretched skyward, looking like they would pull and pluck some green foliage from low-hung tree branches anytime.And then, there are those running with random handclaps, as if they are into swatting of menacing mosquitoes. Some try racing on reverse gear, too, running backward. Heaven help if they slide into booby traps, in the form of deluding pits slickly covered by dry leaves. Then you see those, running with rhythmic forward thrust of their clenched fists, as if parrying attacks by imaginary muggers. Some run with closed fists, too, constantly criss-crossing on their chest, looking like chest-thumping patriots.Next, you have those uber amicable walkers, full of beans and brio, with beatific smiles and bountiful warmth. Of course, some walk like automatons, too, with impassive eyes, fully transfixed on ground below, that you fear the earth would open a chasm anytime. In fact, many strollers walk with such singular seriousness, sporting that staid/stoical look that you feel they are managing a massive mountain on their head.And then, there are those with lackadaisical gait, walking with such languor and lassitude as if lugging behind a load of bricks. If some walkers have their hands swinging like oscillating pendulums; some have their derrires swaying, walking like sassy ramp models, sashaying on runways. In contrast to this, there are those with waddling gait, walking like penguins.There are those who seem like they are making great leaps with vigorous limb movements. But they'd be stuck in same spot, sans any progress, like the huffing and puffing static train, refusing to budge. In contrast, you have those with bounding strides, as if they are bouncing out of a building on a blazing fire.Finally, I too have my own whacky jogging style.

I did not sleep a wink that night, the night before I had to fly to my new home in USA.Thirty-two years since I left my childhood home, I wonder at the huge changes yet everything seems frozen in time in Bangalore. The moon winks at me in the dark night but my jet-lagged body reminds me of pangs of lunch hunger. The airports have changed but it is still the same warm moist air enveloping me as I walk out of the jet way. The long line of taxis is competing with the Olas, Ubers and luxury coaches ready to ship my tired body home.

My wife composed this mantra, mostly because of her fear of coming in contact with any of those items in a non-Indian restaurant.It was kind of assumed that the Indian restaurants in the US also had two kitchens to cater to the vegetarian and non-vegetarian eating customers and also understood the seriousness of serving a non-vegetarian dish to a vegetarian customer! Of course, we never checked if any of the Indian restaurants did have two kitchens.We are vegetarians but not vegans (vegans do not eat and/or use animal products). So, meat was completely ruled out. The restaurants would then take extra precautions and ensure that the dishes would not come in contact with meat and did not have any meat products in them.Even the sauces being used in the Mexican and Asian dishes, some of which are oyster-based, would be replaced with vegetarian options. The pizza cutters would be cleaned with soap before being run over our pizzas. Of course, we would generously tip the stewards and sometimes the chef too, for their extra attention to these details.My wife became suspicious once when she was served a funny looking 'tomato' slice at a leading pizza joint in Hawaii. She had placed the order with a 'no meat' instruction. But when the pizza arrived, the 'tomato' slice not only looked stale but smelt horrible, too. (No offense to all the meat lovers!)In most cases, I would be asked to play the role of a guinea pig to taste the food for quality checks. With this pizza, however, I did not muster the courage to be one; what if that piece was from a pig? Strange it would have been then - 'a pig for a guinea pig'!My wife's dislike for eggs is mostly psychological and goes back to her childhood days. In order to make her strong and healthy, she was offered eggs (as recommended by the family physician), much to her dislike. She would, however, throw it up after few minutes. That feeling must have stayed with her ever since, for even now, a cookie with the slightest hint of egg is rejected at the plate itself.With regard to her dislike for mushrooms, the story is less complicated. Since it is a fungus, it has been easily placed in the 'do not eat' list.Cut to present. Having relocated to India, I have not heard that mantra for a long time. She has, instead, come up with a modified version to suit the environment here. ""Is this chutney made from RO Water?"" She is also a SPOC; no, not a 'Single Point of Contact' but a 'Sanitiser Point of Contact'!"

As soon as the pan hit the heat, he added a generous portion of melted butter. Simultaneously (multitasking with much ease), he broke in a couple of eggs into a bowl, followed by an array of not-so-finely diced ingredients, and his secret ingredient black pepper. With an up-and-down as well as back-and-forth motion, he then beat the hell out of them until there was no strand of white or yellow.""This is going to be the perfect omelette,"" I thought to myself. After a long leave that I had happily sanctioned my cook, soon after which I fell sick, our kitchen had turned into a dismal wasteland. But the man of the house aimed to do something productive in the kitchen that day.But it was when the eggs produced a loud satisfying sizzle on the pan, that I critically questioned my insights. ""Wait a minute! Tell me you didn't tell me that you 'don't know how to cook'!"" I exclaimed. He smirked extravagantly wriggling his elbows and body, and then drawling to me he said, ""Don't know, yah.""After five years of sharing our lives, I had just come to terms with the fact that he's probably never going to make the kitchen a romantic place to be. And yet, here he was, regaling in harmony amid broken egg shells and inedible onion skins.Whilst I coughed away to glory, he gracefully plated up a perfect, bright-yellow, butter-doused omelette with a sprinkle of pepper and a burst of colourful veggies that looked warm, earthy and inviting.Unwittingly following the pattern of a triangle as we sat at the dining table, the three of us began consuming the omelette effectively. As my husband and I recounted the story of ""I don't know how to cook"" and laughed out loud, while also praising the newly discovered sneaky chef, it was obvious that our three-year-old daughter didn't like this kind of commotion at the table. She preferred her mother giving her the fullest attention. I then cut a perfect triangle and speared a morsel of omelette into her mouth and asked, ""Happy now?""Of course, while I can't say enough good things about our new chef's debut performance, one thing is certain.

In just one village, Parsuli, an estimated 100 quintals was either fed to cattle or left to rot in the crop fields. After a relatively better marketing season that lasted till the first week of January, retail prices plunged.Far away, farmers in Erode district in Tamil Nadu were a worried lot after the retail price of cabbage crashed. From Rs 12/kg last year, it dropped to as low as Re 1 per kg. In Chhattisgarh, too, tomato prices crashed, leaving farmers in the lurch.Not fetching more than Rs 2 per kg, farmers simply abandoned the tomato harvest. The deplorable price they get in the market is not even enough to meet the plucking and harvesting cost.This is primarily because of higher production. Whether it is cabbage, tomato, potato, onions or any other crop, the higher the production, lower is the price. A higher production enables middlemen to form cartels and manipulate prices, often to the extent of exploitation.T Rajaganesh, a farmer in Erode district, asks: ""Farmers spend at least Rs 45,000 per acre a month to cultivate cabbage. Add to it the cost of labour, maintenance and fertiliser, and the cost shoots up to more than Rs 50,000 a month.Since it takes almost three months to yield, we have to spend at least Rs 1.5 lakh per acre before harvesting. How can we realise a profit with a farmgate price of Rs 1 per kg?""In the case of tomato too, average cost of production is about Rs 90,000-1 lakh per acre for small farmers. For the big farms, the production cost is a little higher, at Rs 1.25 lakh per acre.Till the first week of January, when I travelled to meet tomato farmers in Durg, the prices were much better - about Rs 1,000 per crate of 25 kg. But, with the advent of tomato crop from Karnataka, the supplies swelled, and prices slumped.Now, let's take the case of chana. According to news reports, chana prices are ruling at about Rs 3,600 per quintal, against the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 4,400 per quintal, a drop of 20% in the retail price.With production expected to increase to 10 million tonnes this year (from 9.33 million tonnes last year), prices are expected to dip with arrivals picking up. Even wheat price has remained below MSP by 6-8% in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, where early crop harvest hit the mandis.In February last week, market price for tur dal was ruling at Rs 4,500 per quintal, against the procurement price of Rs 5,500 at Tandur market in Telangana.Meanwhile, reports of tomato being dumped on the streets in Chhattisgarh poured in again in early March. This is the third year in a row when tomato prices have crashed to Re 1 per kg. In fact, this is the third year in a row when prices of almost all agricultural commodities have crashed across the country.Karnataka modelAfter two years of drought in 2014 and 2015, production picked up after a favourable monsoon in 2016 and 2017. While the increase in production has brought cheers to the government, the drop in prices has added to the misery of farmers.It is here that I see the relevance of a very timely suggestion made by Dr TN Prakash, chairman of the Karnataka Agricultural Prices Commission. He has called for making the Minimum Support Price of crops to be legally binding. He said: ""Consumers have legal protection if produce is sold above MRP and can approach the courts. But, even after 70 years of Independence, farmers don't have similar protection.""For the third year in a row, prices of almost all commodities are at 20-45% lower than MSP in various parts of the country. At times of glut, traders ruthlessly exploit farmers. Even the introduction of the Unified Market Platform in Karnataka, which led to the expansion of 585 eNAM (National Agricultural Market) throughout the country, farmers have not gained.The concept of model price, which is based on the average of the day's trading, is in reality a distress price and needs to be dispensed with. eNAM in reality is a nationwide platform being created to make it profitable for spot trading.In addition to 23 crops for which MSP is announced every year, state governments must work out MSP for highly perishable commodities like tomato, potato, onion and other vegetables.Many states already have a Farmers' Commission, which has more or less become retiring rooms for political appointees.The immediate need is to convert them into State Agricultural Prices Commission, with the mandate to provide higher income to farmers, similar to that in Karnataka. If Karnataka can ensure procurement of 14 crops at prices much higher than the MSP announced by the Centre, I see no reason why other states cannot."

Community organic farming is finding popularity among the working class of the Millennium City, who are not averse to getting their hands dirty in the mud and engage in farming. Currently, over 100 families from across the city are engaged in the practice on leased farms in Badshahpur in a project started by the District Horticulture Department and supported by a local NGO, Green Leaf Initiative.The project was started in October last year by the Gurgaon District Horticulture Officer Deen Mohammad Khan, and was expanded after it gained popularity.

(Source: PTI Photo) Arun Jaitley, along with Union Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan, Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog Arvind Panagariya and CEO, NITI Aayog, Amitabh Kant releasing the book India: Three Year Action Agenda at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi. (Source: PTI Photo)Last month, the NITI Aayog released the Three Year Action Agenda (TYAA) for the government, a roadmap for reforming the various sectors of the economy. Here we look at its agenda for the agriculture sector, and how best it can rescue the sector whose growth has plunged to just 1.8 per cent annually in the first three years of the NDA government.In doing so, we also touch upon the recommendations of some important committees constituted by the current government in the realm of agri-food. These are the High Level Committee (HLC) on Management of Foodgrains and Restructuring FCI (headed by Shanta Kumar, January 2015), the Task Force on Agriculture headed by the Vice-Chairman of the NITI Aayog (May 2016) and the four volumes (out of 14) of the Committee on Doubling of Farmers Income (August 2017). The government, thus, has ample reference points for reforming the food and agriculture sector.The TYAA basically talks of action pertaining, first, to increasing productivity of land and water, second to reforming agri-markets on the lines of e-NAM, third, reforming tenancy laws, and finally, relief measures during natural disasters. There is nothing new  and nothing wrong  in these recommendations; they have been made by the committees cited above. The TYAA, however, does not prioritise policy actions, nor does it talk about the role of trade policy in agriculture, or reforming the massive system of food and fertiliser subsidies. Nevertheless, the hard question is whether the government is ready to bite the bullet.We think urgent action is needed on five fronts and list them in order of priority. First, the government needs to improve the profitability of cultivation by getting markets right, second, it needs to invest in water to fulfil its slogan of har khet ko pani and more crop per drop, its third priority should be Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) of food and fertiliser subsidies to the accounts of targeted beneficiaries, which can release resources for investments, fourth it should ensure that the new Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) delivers compensation to farmers in time, and finally, it should free up land lease markets. Let us elaborate on these points a bit.By now it is clear that the policy of minimum support prices (MSPs)  and the promise of 50 per cent profits over costs in the BJPs election manifesto of 2014  has not improved profitability of cultivation in the last three years. In fact, farmers returns have gone down in the case of most crops. The situation is worse for producers of basic vegetables like potatoes, onions and tomatoes. Prices of these crops during harvest time plunged to about Rs 2 per kg in the last season while the consumers were still paying Rs 15 to Rs 20 per kg. Attempts to reform the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) markets on the lines of the model act of 2003, and now through the Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing Act, 2017, have not achieved much success.However, India has shown in the case of milk, through Operation Flood  a la the AMUL model  that farmers can get 70-80 per cent of the price paid by consumers. Why then cant we have Operation Veggies on similar lines? A beginning can be made with at least onions, potatoes and tomatoes. That would require buying directly from farmers groups (FPOs), setting up logistics from grading, storage to movement, and linking them to organised retail (including e-retail), large processors and exporters. But to do all this, the government will have to commit not only enough resources as it did for Operation Flood but also change certain laws, including the Essential Commodities Act (ECA).The e-NAM scheme, which is supposed to create an all India market, in order to ensure better prices to farmers, has not succeeded in its endeavour so far. Software is still being installed in mandis to enable them to switch auctions from the shouting platform to the electronic ones. Inter-mandi and inter-state transactions are very rare. However, an easier way to improve farmers profitability is to open up exports of all agri-products, without any restrictions, and allowing private trade to build global value chains, keeping the ECA in abeyance. This would require a change from the current pro-consumer approach to one that is focussed on farmers.Second is the issue of investments, especially in water. The Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana is mandated to complete 99 irrigation projects by 2019, which will bring 76 lakh ha additional area under irrigation. NABARD, with Rs 40,000 crore as Long-Term Irrigation Fund, is to help states in completing these projects. It would be a commendable achievement for the government if it can complete these projects as planned. But open canal systems with flood irrigation dont give high water-use efficiency.It is time to accord higher priority to micro-irrigation (drip and sprinklers) to achieve the objective of more crop per drop. Israel and the US could be good examples to follow: Israel has the highest proportion (99 per cent) of its irrigated area under micro-irrigation while the US has largest absolute area (15 m ha) under micro-irrigation (See graph).The third area for action should be DBT of food and fertiliser subsidies. The HLC has already provided a roadmap in this respect. Rs 30,000 to Rs 50,000 crores can be saved each year, which can be invested in water resources and upgrading marketing infrastructure.The fourth area is ensuring that the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) delivers. Currently, several states dont pay premium in time, dont conduct crop cutting experiments, and as a result, farmers suffer long delays in getting any compensation. These lacunae can be fixed through modern technology and better governance, provided there is a champion in the government to deliver.The last suggestion would be to free up land lease markets for long periods. China allows land lease for 30 years so that corporate bodies can work with farmers, bringing in their best expertise, inputs and investments.

To start with, they seem to be concentrated in the relatively more prosperous agriculture belts  the stretch from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune to Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur in Western Maharashtra and Neemuch, Mandsaur and Ratlam in MPs Malwa region. Farmers here grow a range of commercial crops. They are also largely from progressive agricultural communities such as Marathas and Patidars. These farmers  unlike their brethren in drought-prone Marathwada, Vidarbha or Bundelkhand, who are largely into subsistence agriculture, and often resort to seasonal migratory employment  have seen good times, particularly through the first decade of this century till about 2013. This was a period of remunerative prices for most crops on the back of a global agri-commodity boom and domestic demand fuelled by rising incomes.The first setback to the above party came towards mid-2014, with the collapse of world commodity prices, leading to both falling exports and rising imports of farm products from the country. The current crisis, however, has to do more with domestic headwinds that may have some link with demonetisation. In virtually every crop marketed since November  whether soyabean, green gram, pigeon-pea and potatoes or tomato, onion, garlic, red chili, fenugreek, grapes and pomegranates  farmers have experienced huge price declines. The government claims this is mainly due to bumper production. But there is also a demand side. Produce trading in India is predominantly cash-based. The body blow this traditional agro-commercial capital has suffered due to demonetisation  and the inability of formal finance to fill the gap  may explain the apparent lack of liquidity in the markets now. With nobody really to buy and stock up, the speculative capital that used to buoy commodity prices has practically ceased to exist. And its farmers who have taken the ultimate hit.This situation is unsustainable, both politically and economically. But the solution cannot lie in farm loan waivers. Indebtedness is only the symptom of the actual disease, which is one of low prices and demand for produce. What the farm sector desperately needs is liquidity, which can come from institutional finance, modern agro-processing and organised retail, both domestic and foreign. While a zero GST rate on most primary farm produce is a welcome move, it needs to be supplemented with the removal of all restrictions on stockholding, domestic movement and exports. There is also a case to impose higher import duties, especially on pulses and edible oils, as a temporary measure. If there can be anti-dumping duties and minimum import prices on steel or float glass, why not for products from the farm  more so, in todays troubled times?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5b5061f69855b70b4a41aa49,Back to waste basics,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/back-to-waste-basics-solid-waste-management-swachh-bharat-4767068/,2017-07-26,,Indian Express,"Rag pickers look for reusable materials at a garbage dump littered with polythene bags in Lucknow. (AP Photo/Rajesh Kumar Singh) Rag pickers look for reusable materials at a garbage dump littered with polythene bags in Lucknow. (AP Photo/Rajesh Kumar Singh)The challenge of solid waste management in Indian cities is now receiving belated but welcome attention and about time too. Rising incomes and changing lifestyles are generating more waste and of a different kind, but we are yet to set up systems to deal with the build-up. Swachh Bharat Mission provides an opening, but much more needs to be done on the ground.Waste was not such a problem in India until the 1970s. In our rural areas, food discards were returned to the soil. Food leftovers were fed to animals and the cattle-shed wastes were thrown in a pit to decompose and become manure for the next planting season. This returned both NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) nutrients as well as micronutrients to the soil for healthy crops.Urban food discards were also recognised as a potential resource, not a waste. In Portuguese Goa, bullock carts would move from bungalow to bungalow, collecting kitchen leftovers for on-farm composting. This was the earliest Indian version of doorstep waste collection. In big cities like Bangalore, farmers would bring their produce to town for early-morning auctions, then move to the cement-ring waste bins at street corners and empty them to take back home and produce manure. In fact, they would fight over collection rights for this fertile resource. This age-old practice kept Indian soils rich in carbon, up to 4 per cent.All this changed with the beginning of the plastic era in the 1970s. Some readers will recall how plastic bags were initially cherished as a useful item for hoarding in our homes, carefully taken out for re-use when needed. As the bags became more common, poor quality, and disposable, we began throwing them away into our kitchen waste-bins. When farmers took such mixed waste to their farms, the fields wore a non-biodegradable plastic film, preventing rain from entering the soil and keeping seeds from germinating through them  an example of negative urban-rural connectivity.Two useful resources, biodegradable waste and plastic, when mixed together, became waste and remained uncollected. Add to this the mixing of other dry waste and the debris from construction and demolition down the supply chain of waste, and this assorted mixed waste presents a major management challenge for the municipal authorities.City managers forced to deal with this growing waste began collecting and dumping the same outside the city limits. Since nearby farms and villages did not want this mixed waste either, it often ended up along the sides of roads leading out of town. These convenient ribbons of no mans land were not managed or defended by anyone. When even these filled up with ridges of waste, cities found larger areas outside to create mini hills of mixed waste.These rotting heaps of waste, denied oxygen from the air, emit methane (CH4) which is over 21 times more potent as a heat trapping gas than carbon dioxide. They generate ammonia which smells like dirty urinals and nauseating hydrogen sulphide which smells like rotten eggs. The airless heaps also produce leachate, a black liquid oozing out from the waste. Imagine a rotten tomato in a plastic bag which turns to a smelly liquid, unlike a similar rotten tomato which is left in the open air and dries to powder. This example illustrates the importance of aerating the waste heaps.Waste heaps without adequate exposure to air take 25-30 years to slowly decompose, continuously releasing methane and leachate. This leachate seeps down into the soil and contaminates open wells and after a longer time even reaches and pollutes bore wells through deep natural water channels. When waste is dumped in low-lying areas or quarry pits, the hydrostatic pressure of so much water-logging forces the leachate into water veins even faster. There is no way to treat this deep underground contamination, which makes wells and bore wells unfit for drinking and even for irrigation for decades.Households need to be made to stop mixing biodegradable waste with dry waste (paper, plastic, glass, etc) and keep hazardous domestic waste completely separate. The segregation of waste at source into wet (compostable), dry (recyclable) and sanitary (disposable diapers and sanitary napkins) categories is now compulsory for all citizens of India in the Solid Waste Management Rules 2016. However, residents typically complain that the waste is mixed again in the door-to- door collection process. While demanding high standards for door-to-door collection, we must continue with our discipline at home.In 2003, Suryapet in Andhra Pradesh was the first Indian city to process its wet waste, recycle its dry waste and leave nothing for landfilling. Vengrula in Maharashtra and Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu are the latest of over 20 urban local bodies to achieve near zero waste to landfill. The wet waste needs to be collected and processed daily, either composted at home or taken to nearby locations for decentralised composting or biogas production or taken to centralised plants. At the very least, the waste needs to be stabilised as described below. The correct way to manage fresh waste is to expose as much of it to air as soon as possible. Worldwide, the standard way of doing this is to unload the waste in windrows, not high heaps.Windrows are long low parallel heaps of waste, not more than two metres high, which are designed to achieve the best conditions for aerating the waste. Only parking-lot type management is required to guide incoming vehicles on where and how to unload their waste, moving slowly forward and leaving the waste behind in a long row. Enough space is left between rows for a lifting tractor or earthmover to drive through and turn the waste in the windrow.The outer aerated waste should form the inner core of a new windrow, and the airless centre of the old heap now on the outside. Weekly turning of the waste, repeated at least four times, ensures that all parts of the waste are fully decomposed, like leaves on a forest floor, turning dark brown and with a sweet earthy smell. The process can be speeded up by the addition of composting bio-cultures (fresh cow dung or substitutes available in the market).Fresh waste windrows heat up inside, to about 55C to 60C in three to four days. After four turnings, there is about 40 per cent weight loss as moisture content declines and also about 40 per cent volume reduction. After this, no leachate or methane or smelly gases are released, and this fully stabilised waste is called compost, rich in microbes as well as humus, both wonderful for soil vitality.This bio-stabilising of biodegradable waste makes a city fully compliant with the SWM Rules 2016. Screening makes it more farmer-friendly and helps move useful fractions offsite to ensure continued long-term use of the same site for waste processing. The recycling of existing waste management space is one of the biggest advantages of waste stabilising and frees local bodies from the constant search for new sites to pollute and new urban rural battles over locations for waste processing.Ahluwalia is chairperson, ICRIER, Delhi, and former chairperson of the high-powered expert committee on urban infrastructure and services.

But a section of farmers in the state are beginning to respond to farmer producer organizations (FPOs) attempt at marketing as an alternative to the traditional direct selling. The move is also expected to help farmers break the what-paddy cycle and take to growing vegetables.A study sponsored by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has found that the 69 FPOs in the state with 2,991 farmers as members have facilitated a shift towards crops without minimum support price (MSP). Twenty-nine more FPOs will be added in the ongoing financial year.The report makes out a case for integration of FPOs into the agriculture policy of the state by providing them agricultural produce marketing committee (APMC) licenses.In the case of wheat, out of 74 sampled farmers, 73 continued to sell their produce directly even after FPOs were formed. However, out of 21 pea farmers, 11 switched to FPOs. For other vegetables (except tomato, potato and peas) too, half of the 20 sampled farmers shifted to FPOs.Not just that, eight other farmers who were growing other crops too shifted to growing vegetables on a part of their land and sold it through FPOs.

Besides, peas grown over 70% of the land, was sold through FPOs. The area under other vegetables post FPOs has grown marginally to 12 acres from 9.60 acres. It depends on the functioning of each organisation. The FPO concept is yet to evolve to be really beneficial for marginal farmers. For instances, some FPOs are still relying on commission agents as licenses are still hard to come by, said Kiran Singh, a small farmer from Pathankot.However, the shift doesnt seem that easy as it turns out that even in case of matured FPOs, the area under cultivation of vegetables as well as sugarcane in kharif season was high but the farmers continued to sell all their produce directly. But this area has shifted from cultivation of paddy, which is indicative of some crop diversification taking place in the state. A subtle trend seems to be underway towards growing of produce basket crops, particularly vegetables, added Verma.The agricultural produce marketing committee (APMC) Act in Punjab makes it mandatory for farmers to sell their produce only in government organised markets through commission agents. These markets are manifested with several imperfections leading to asymmetric information that harms the interests of farmers, says the report.Counter ViewThere are farmers like Capt Amarjit Singh Bhattal, who grows organic vegetables on Ludhiana-Ferozepur Road, isnt satisfied with the FPO model. Integrating consumers to spell out his requirement is one thing but the concept of cooperatives hasnt worked in the state. I take my produce up to retail level.

While warming of a status quo till end of January, officials of the Telangana states agricultural marketing department attribute the abnormal price rise to the excessive rains in onion-growing states such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and West Bengal.They predict a price correction by February.Late rainfall in September and October damaged the onion kharif crop in Telangana also. Due to this, the supplies are now coming in only from Maharashtra, said Padma Harsha , deputy director of department.Predictably, J Ananthaiah, selection grade secretary, agricultural market committee at Malakpet , said that the daily procurements have dropped from nearly 40,000 bags per day to 10,000-15,000 onions bags per day, thus pushing the rates northwards.The steep jump in costs has adversely impacted traders in other markets whove stopped selling onions. We cannot purchase onions at such a rise price. Hence, we are clearing our old stock. If the situation continues, we may be forced to keep our shops shut, said Mohammed Abid , a vegetable vendor at the Erragadda Rhythu Bazaar.Not just onions, prices of other vegetables such as tomato, cabbage, carrot too have registered a more than 200 per cent rise in price rise as compared to the last winter season. While one kg of tomato cost 8 in December 2016, the price has now shot to 26 per kg. The price of carrot has increased from 16 to 50 per kg.Onions and tomato are basic vegetables. With the price rise, we are now forced to purchase these vegetables in lesser quantities, said Vijayalaxmi, a housewife from Kokapet. The steep rise in cost of vegetables has driven inflation to an eight-month high of 3.93 per cent."

Weather will remain dry the rest of the time.Moderate to dense fog is likely to occur at isolated places on December 13 and 14. Weather is likely to remain dry for the next two days. Maximum and minimum temperature is expected to hover between 16 and 21 degrees celsius and 5 to 12 degree celsius respectively. Maximum relative humidity is expected to remain between 78% and 90 % and minimum between 42% and 68 % during these days. Farmers sowing the gram crop are advised to use 36 kg seed per acre. They should treat the seed in termite-infested soil with Dursban 20 EC (chlorpyriphos) @ 10 ml per kg seed. Under December sowing, transplanting of gobhi sarson is more profitable than direct sowing, say experts. Farmers have also been advised to use 60-day old seedlings of gobhi sarson (GSL-1), 35-40 day old seedlings for gobhi sarson hybrid Hyola PAC 401 and 30-35 day old seedlings for GSC 6.As clear weather is expected during the next 3-4 days, wheat crop cv. PBW 658 and PBW 590 should be sown. Farmers are advised to spray weedicides.

Farmers have been warned against treating seed a month before sowing as it hampers germination.They should manage rodent pests in wheat crop sown with Happy Seeder by burrow baiting with 2% zinc phosphide twice at an interval of 10 to 15 days after sowing of crop (a week before or after irrigation) during this period. Farmers are also advised to spray magnesium sulphate in deficit soils where the wheat crop is 24 to 25 days old.They are advised to conduct regular surveillance of their fields for late blight of potato and if symptoms appear, spray the crop with Indofil M-45/Markzeb/Kavach @ 500-700 g in 250-350 litres of water per acre. For judicious use of pesticides, follow DSS for management of late blight of potato. If there is curling of leaves, farmers should uproot plants or damage infected plants. To control rust in pea, spray 500 g of Indofil M-45 in 200 litres of water. It is the optimum time for transplanting of nursery of tomato and brinjal and sowing of European varieties of radish, turnip and carrot should also be completed.Its time to protect fruit plants, particularly young ones, from low temperature and prepare thatches on young fruit plants. Ensure irrigation to ber trees as fruit is in developmental stage. Spray Karathane (0.5ml) or Bayleton (0.5 g) or Wettable Sulphur (2.5 g) per litre water to check powdery mildew in ber. To check physiological fruit drop in ber, spray Naphthlene Acetic Acid (NAA) @ 15g per 500 litres of water per acre. Dissolve NAA in alcohol before mixing in water.New-born calves need special care in the cold as they are susceptible to pneumonia. They should be fed well-chaffed berseem mixed with wheat straw to avoid tympany (Aphara). Do not feed parali (rice straw) alone to animals because it is rich in silica and causes diarrhoea.

Some traders said monsoons played the spoilsport, some others heaped the blame on demonetisation and GST.With the onset of winter, when prices of vegetables are lower, consumers are shelling out as high as Rs 50 per kg for many vegetables. Take for example onions till the time of filing this report, the price of onion in the local markets for Rs 50-Rs 60 per kg, this when price hike has eased considerably. I purchased onions a few days ago for Rs 80, said Rajesh Kumar Saxena, a government official.Tomatoes were available at Rs 8-10 per kg last year. Till Tuesday evening, it was at steep Rs 60 per kg. On Wednesday, tomato prices somewhat cooled. Vendors say it will take at least a week to 10 days for prices to come down.WHAT THE VENDORS SAYDemonetisation effect could be the reason for this hike in tomato prices, say some vendors.Good quality tomatoes take 50-100 days to grow depending on the variety. Usually people begin sowing in May-June after the summer harvest. By winters, tomato is ready. However, this year there is less quantity of tomato this season. Small farmers who sell their produce directly in the market have been removed from the process this years, said Shri Kant, a local vegetable vendor in Bagsewani vegetable market, adding that there was a disruption in the production cycle induced by demonetisation.According to Abdul Raqib , president of Aloo Pyaaz Wholesaler Association , ill-timed monsoons resulted in wastage of many crops this year. The monsoon was unpredictable this year. There were no rains for better part of the monsoon season, but there were flash rains in the end. This lead to a crop failure in many parts which is why, there is less supply this season and more demand leading to push in prices. Raqib, however, said hike in tomato prices is likely to ease in coming days and have already seen a drop since Wednesday. The retail prices of vegetables are around 35-50% higher than the wholesale rate, due to wastage of perishable goods in winter. For example: The wholesale price of onion is Rs 30 per kg, whereas in market Rs 60.Other perishables like potatoes, cauliflower, peas, green onion, green leafy vegetable, pumpkin, brinjals are also seeing a price fluctuations because of the same. Vendors, however, say prices of seasonal vegetables will stabilise in the next two to three days.WHAT THE RESIDENTS SAYThis has been troubling Bhopalis as they have to make do without an essential vegetable in their winter platter. Tomatoes and onions are used in almost every Indian dish. These are essential products which cannot be substituted for anything else. This hike in prices upset my daily grocery budget, said Natasha Matani , an engineer, working with a private company. This pattern, however, is not limited to Bhopal alone, but is a nationwide phenomenon. According to government data, inflation based on consumer food price index rose to 4.42% from 1.90% a month ago and 2.03% a year ago, whereas vegetable prices have increased to 22.48% in November from 7.47% last month.This despite the fact that Madhya Pradesh saw a bumper onion crop this season.Some residents feel the government is also to be blamed for this. Every day we read in news that onion has been rotting in the open. In a country where people are still struggling for daily meals, government should have not let so much food get waste, said Matani. There were others who said that the administration should intervene as the prices are burning a hole in the pocket of common people. Maladministration and crop wastage lead to such a situation. The government should intervene to ensure easy distribution of vegetables in markets so that we do face loss due to poor administration, said Reeta Prakasham , an educationist.WHAT THE EXPERTS SAYAfter initial slim pickings of food crops in few months post-demonetisation, many farmers were forced to terminate their summer crop due to which there is shortage of tomato supply in the market this season. Experts say during this time last year with demonetisation, the sapped currency supply lead to sudden decrease in prices. The farmers needed money and traders did not have it, which is why they had to sell their products cheap which eventually lead to less sowing in the next season. The effect of which is becoming apparent this winter.B L Sharma, an economist in the Madhya Pradesh Planning Commission, says as the winter intensifies, prices of perishables will drop. Prices are expected to come down in coming few days after the winter intensifies. Perishables are dependent on weather and also on the demand supply gap. When demand goes up, vendors stock supplies to take advantage of it, further pushing prices.State horticulture director Satyanand said, The rise and fall in prices is due to market forces, which balance themselves on their own. When there is a gap between harvest and sowing new crop, this problem comes up, which will get solved as soon as the new stock arrives.However, there are many, who blame demonetisation and GST for the same. Indias perishable market is a cash-based mandi dependent system. Even though cash has come back in overall circulation, it is yet to be efficiently circulated in the mandis. Over a year has gone by, but payments are still being done in cashless method, which is not convenient to small and medium farmers, said an expert seeking anonymity.The surge in prices is also due to delay in reaction to the supply and demand. Due to disturbed production of perishable goods this year, the market is not very flexible to demand and supply changes this year. For example, if demand increases for a vegetable, it will take time for market forces to adjust themselves to accommodate the rise in demand with the supply, since the mandis and wholesale markets are still not running efficiently as compared to previous years, the expert said, adding that another week might give the market enough time to adjust with the demand leading to a stable rate."

The video went viral on social media on Tuesday.Someone had told me that you cannot eat what Modi eats every day because it is not the poor peoples food. I asked him what kind of food does he (PM) eat? The person told me Modiji eats mushrooms. I told him what is the big deal in this, as mushrooms are available here also. He then told me that Modi does not eat what you people eat here. He gets imported mushrooms from Taiwan. The mushrooms which are imported from Taiwan cost around Rs 80,000 each. I was amazed. He went on saying Modi Saheb consumes five mushrooms a day, says Alpesh in the video.Alpesh further said in the video that to a query, he was told by the person that Modi has been eating mushrooms since he was CM (of Gujarat).Now, I know the reason why he became so fair as he was as dark as me earlier.

The retail price, however, has remained more unchanged.While green peas prices have spiraled to Rs 40-45/kg in wholesale market from Rs 25 on Wednesday, pushing the retail price to Rs 70-80/kg from the earlier Rs 50-60, the low supply of capsicum from Palghar due to the recent unseasonal rain has pushed up the wholesale rates to Rs 30-35 a kg from 25-30. Capsicum is currently retailed at Rs 60-70/kg from Rs 50-60 earlier.However, tomato prices have dropped to Rs 20 from Rs 25-30/kg in the wholesale market, bringing down the retail price too to Rs 40-50/kg from Rs 50-60 on Wednesday. It was sold at Rs 40-55 in Andheri.Onion prices rose in wholesale market despite the arrival of 125 trucks on Thursday, said potato-onion wholesale trader Ashok Walunj. APMC received just 30 trucks on Wednesday as against 110 trucks on Tuesday. However, the prices had remained unchanged with poor turnout of retailers. The rates are expected rise further and then stabilize in the next couple of weeks. While red onions were retailed at Rs 45-50/kg at Andheri-Versova, old onions were sold at Rs 55-60.Experts say the recent showers may have affected the quality of onions. Even a days non-seasonal rain can cause a lot of damage to the crop that is being harvested. The quantum is yet to be ascertained; a clear picture will emerge by next week, said Manohar Totlani, a trader. The harvest may get delayed by almost a week due to wet ground conditions, where farmers avoid collecting the crop.Early this week, wholesale onion prices had dropped to Rs 25-30/kg from Rs 30-35, attributing to arrival of fresh crop armed with the Centres cap on export by raising the minimum export price. But after the unseasonal showers on Monday and Tuesday, the prices have shot up yet again. Vegetable prices will remain uncertain till this weekend. The picture will be clear by Monday when the quantum of damage crop is expected to come to fore, said Balasaheb Badade, a trader.Mumbaikars are worried about the rising prices. Kandivli resident Abhijeet Thakur said, There has been no relief from expensive vegetables for the last few months. We have reduced the quantity to adjust the kitchen budget. The prices of other vegetables have remained mostly unchanged despite only 450 truckloads arriving in the APMC compared to the usual supply of 500-600 trucks. After a spell of inflation, vegetable prices were normalizing, but rain played spoilsport. A small bundle of coriander costs Rs 20 against the earlier Rs 10, said Mahim resident Rekha Sharma."
