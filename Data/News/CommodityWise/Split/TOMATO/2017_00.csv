Its good to dump our crop on the road, he said.While some farmers blamed it on demonetisation and cash crunch, Shajapur mandi secretary Rajesh Mishra dismissed the allegations, saying high supply and low demand had caused the prices to fall.The Madhya Pradesh government had announced facilities such as cash vans and transport subsidy for farmers to face cash crunch, but farmers claimed they are yet to receive them.According to sources, the daily supply of tomatoes at Shajapur mandi is around 200 to 300 crates as many farmers are sending their crop directly to Bhopal and Indore markets.They claimed that the rates were decent at Indore and Bhopal mandis."

It had also planned transport subsidy for vegetable growers.However, when HT visited Laxmibai Nagar and Choithram mandisthe largest in the regionthe promised facilities were not available.People buying vegetables at Choithram sabji mandi on Monday. (Shankar Mourya/HT photo)Farmers were getting poor prices for a range of vegetables and in some cases, such as green peas and tomatoes, they were not getting enough to even cover the input costs.Our condition has gone from bad to worse due to cash crunch and demonetisation. Today (on Monday) we are getting Rs 50-60 for a crate (25 kg) of tomatoes. That will barely cover the transport, hammali (porter) and mandi charges, said Hukumchand Makwana, a farmer from Piplu village, about 70 km from Indore.We have to pay labourers and also need money for paying interest on debt besides running our households. So we have no option but to sell our produce at low rates, said farmer Shantilal Chawra who has been staying at the mandi premises for past three days to sell his green peas, whose prices have come down to Rs 5 per kg, less than the input costs.The demand-supply equation has also turned against the farmers as production of seasonal vegetables has increased whereas people have tightened their purses.When asked about the support provided by the mandi administration after demonetisation, commission agent Ashok Bhilware said they have been left to fend for themselves.Commission agents act as a link between farmers and wholesale traders to keep the vegetable supply chain running and often lend money to farmers.Small farmers need cash for their daily requirements. Nowadays, there is liquidity crisis but farmers supplying vegetable do not accept cheques, he said.Officials told HT that no directive to provide special facilities to vegetable farmers has come from Bhopal.We have not received any such directive (to talk to the banks about providing cash vans or give transport subsidy) so far from the state government, Praveen Verma, deputy director, MP State Agricultural Marketing Board, Indore region, said.Choithram mandi in-charge B B S Tomar could not be reached for comment despite visit to his office, repeated calls and text messages.WOES MOUNTPrices of potatoes, onions, and seasonal vegetables including tomatoes and green peas have crashed.Transportation costs are increasing due to rise in fuel costs. On top of that farmers have to pay to hammals (porters) and also pay mandi charges. So in some cases, they have been unable to recover even the input costs.Facilities announced by the government including cash vans and transport subsidy have not been implemented"

The village has a population of 320 people and they are dependent only on agriculture.Villagers complain that in the past one decade or so, attacks by monkeys and wild boars in their agriculture land have made things difficult. We keep guarding fields from monkeys during day and from wild boars during night, said Negi.Farming in hills is shrinking fast and farmers losing interest in it. Besides attacks by monkeys and wild boars, farmers facing problem due to lack of irrigation facility. Farming in hills is rain fed and canals are limited to some pockets.In Doon Dwara, villagers have either stopped or growing limited crops like millets, oats, vegetables like cucumber, tomatoes, potatoes etc.Shyam Singh, another farmer, said monkeys destroy vegetables while wild boars destroy potato fields. We are left with very little options, Singh said.Farming in hills has become a non-profitable entity. Government figure shows that agriculture land came down from 7.91 lakh hectares in 2009-10 to 7.41 lakh in 2011-12.Half of the states agricultural land falls in four districts of Dehradun, Nainital, Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar in plains and rest is shared by nine hill districts.Prakash Dimri, another farmer, said: 2,200 is the average cost that comes on sowing in an area of 0.02 hectares or 1 nali while the return is not more than 1,500.The land holdings are tiny and which are getting further fragmented over time. 87% farming in hills is rain fed while only 13% has irrigation facility, said Vijay Jardhari, an agro expert.Change in the climate pattern is also a big concern, rain cycle is no more regular thus farmers are left with little choice, he said.Jardhari said farmers must continue with millets since it survives drought like condition and give handsome returns. He, however, is clueless on providing solutions to farmers who were not growing millets owing to threat from wild animals.Due to growing population of monkeys, acres of arable land left untilled and agriculture activities have almost reduced to vicinity of houses in the villages.Villagers in Thano in the outskirts of Dehradun are trying to grow crops such as ginger, turmeric, bitter gourd and lady finger that usually monkeys dont eat.People in Balori village that falls in Pauri district have passed a resolution asking the district administration to either drive away monkeys or vasectomise them.The forest department is entrusted with the task of catching monkeys but it is confined to urban areas. In February 2016, the department gave permission with riders to kill the wild boars affecting farming in hills.Killing wild boars is not an easy task. In the absence of trained hunters, the order is meaningless said Ratan Aswal of village Mirchoda."

Trap them.""In one protest last month, dozens of taxi drivers posed as would-be passengers, flooding the app with requests before forcing the Uber drivers from their vehicles, much to the bemusement of onlookers.The management of taxis in Morocco normally falls to local government. The transport ministry has so far kept quiet as to why Uber continues to operate in the streets of Casablanca.- 'Illegal and unauthorised' -""Our position hasn't changed,"" a senior official from Casablanca's local administration told AFP. ""We see (Uber) as an unauthorised and illegal company.""Local media said recently that as many as 30 separate protests against app drivers had been held, ranging from threats, car chases and even ambushes such as the one in DecemberUber Morocco director general Meryem Belqziz insisted these were ""isolated"" incidents.""There were no injuries. It was more harassment,"" she told AFP, admitting however that Uber drivers had been ""shaken"" by some protests.There are now more than 250 taxis working for Uber in Casablanca, Belqziz said, and the app has enjoyed 15,000 unique users in the last three months.Business has boomed for Uber since it launched in San Francisco in 2011.But the smartphone app has faced stiff resistance from traditional taxi drivers the world over, as well as bans in some places over safety concerns and questions over legal issues, including taxes.Uber says it is not a transport company like taxi firms, and that it simply connects drivers with passengers.While many drivers have been tempted by Uber's model, many more operators of Casablanca's estimated 18,000 taxis continue to denounce the app's ""unfair competition"", while passengers still heavily rely instead on local ride startups such as Careem and chauffeur.ma.The recent opening of a new tram line in the city has also siphoned off some of the local drivers' traditional clientele.""The tram has already eaten up an important part of our market, and things are getting worse with Uber, which operates without constraint,"" said Abdelouahed.Belqziz insists that Uber and local taxis can operate side-by-side, but admits her firm's legal status ""needs clarifying"".""With every important change you meet resistance, but with time people get used to new modes of consumption,"" she said."

(PTI File Photo) NCP president Sharad Pawar. (PTI File Photo)NCP President Sharad Pawar on Thursday described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a smooth talker while taunting him over the note ban decision and wondered if he would now go after the gold ornaments worn by people. The former Defence Minister took potshots at Modi and highlighted the problems faced by common people following his decision to scrap the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes.WATCH VIDEO | President Pranab Mukherjee Warns Modi Government Regarding DemonetisationPeople told me: The next step (after demonetisation) is that the Government will check the gold ornaments we are wearing. This is how things are now. That means this is our last term as Parliament members. People will never elect us again, he said at a rally in Pimpalgaon near here.People told me: You speak to him (Modi) about the problems caused by demonetisation as you have good relations with him. They said when Modi came to an event in Pune, he praised me, saying it was I who guided him in politics, Pawar said.I said, this is it. I brought him into politics. He (Modi) is a smooth talker. He speaks in such a powerful manner that the person hearing him believes there is something to the manthat he must be having a 56-inch chest, he said.The Maratha strongman noted that BJPs own ally Shiv Sena had opposed the currency scrap exercise and it should now decide what punishment should be given to the PM for the failed drive.Modi said give him 50 days and (if demonetisation didnt succeed, he was willing to bear any punishment people gave him. Shiv Sena is their ally. I read (Sena chief) Uddhav Thackerays speech where he said in which public square should Modi be made to stand (to accept punishment), he said.The former Agriculture Minister said people are bearing the brunt of the note ban exercise which has caused collapse of remunerative prices for vegetable growers.The promised 50 days are over. Prices of all items have collapsed, be it onions or tomatoes. I had two acres of brinjal crop in my farm. A fortnight ago, I went home and asked my associate who handles the farm work about the earnings from the brinjal crop.When he gave me the receipt, I said it shows even the transportation cost was not recovered. If this is the plight of a person like me, what will be your situation? wondered the veteran Parliamentarian.Modi had heaped praises on the NCP chief at an event in Pune in November where he was invited by Pawar. I have personal respect for Sharadrao. He helped me walk in politics by holding my finger. I feel proud to pronounce this publicly, the PM had stated.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(K Giri Babu | EPS)Rucksack on my back I stepped down at the Tirupati railway station early one morning last week, and found that something was amiss. I ought to have heard the passenger ahead of me, peaceable until now, break out into a full-throated Govinda, Govinda! slogan by now. At this time of the year, the station is normally packed with devotees either going to the Venkateshwara temple on Tirumala hill or returning from from there. But the platform was sparse with the odd peasant family from the interiors lolling on a bedroll on the bare floor and bleary-eyed returnees picking up their luggage and briskly making for exits. Even the man at the kiosk outside the station yodeling to passengers to buy bus tickets to Tirumala was not being very successful. Was this the demonetisation effect, I wondered.After refreshments, I drove out of town into Rayalaseema's parched hinterland of hillocks and precarious rock formations that threaten drama but never deliver. Rayalaseema lends itself to both cynics and poets. The former call it Rallaseema (country of rocks) and latter Ratanalaseema (country of rubies). The cynics are winning right now. A timeless drought has taken grip of this region, enveloping everyone, businessmen, small-time traders, farmers, students, poets, cynics, in an indolent stupor.I first stopped at Srinivasa Mangapuram, which lies on one of the two routes taken by trekkers to reach the big temple on Tirumala. This town too is sacred, having its own temple to the same god, but presented as the Kalyana Venkateswara. Hymns recited by priests in the temple wrapped the area in a spiritual aura. The first man I met said he was a tailor from Keelapatla, a village 75 km in the interior. He and his family had walked the distance to go to the Tirumala temple and decided to do the mandatory Srinivasa Mangapuram detour. He said he wasnt happy. I have had no business in the past two months, Prakash said. We are going to Tirumala to pray so that we may have something to live for. My family needs at least Rs 200 per day. Im not making even that. As proof of his determination, Prakash showed me the blisters on the soles of his feet. They had been trekking for two days with a four-hour break at Kanipakam, another holy stopover on the Tirumala pilgrim circuit.I stepped over to a juicers stall to see if he had it any better. B Guravaiah repeated to me the tailors story in much the same manner, doleful but hopeful at the same time. I am not making even Rs. 200 a day, said the vendor. The devotees are coming but no one comes to me for a drink.I continued my journey along the ghat road skirting the Seshachlam forests, home to rare red sanders woods and smugglers of the wood and hunters of the smugglers. In 2016, the troika made for a dysfunctional ecosystem that kept journalists like me busy reporting their skirmishes but now as 2017 beckoned, the forest was an inviting diversion. The scene from the window of my taxi was sylvan and the green canopy seemed to awn over all the difficulties of the past two months.When soon the woods parted company with me, I decided to break at Bhakrapet and walked over to a group of youngsters on bikes who had stopped by the roadside. They were students of Sri Venkateswara Ayurvedic College in Tirupati. They were on their way to Talakona to see the waterfall there. How had the past year been?It was good. In fact, very good. My sister and my brother got married in May and August. And Ill get married in 2017, said one of the happy boys.Does he love her? Oh no, my parents settled the match. I believe in arranged marriage, he said, breaking out in titters.He said his name was Balakrishna and his home was Mahbubnagar, Telangana. He is studying for an MD degree in ayurvedic medicine and his hope for 2017 was to set up a practice in his native town.Another of the bikers, Dr Chakaradhar, said he was looking forward to his wedding too, next year. Im engaged. And after marriage I will set up a clinic at home in Kadapa, he said.A few miles out of Bhakrapet, I was back in the droughtscape of Rayalaseema with the happy conversation with the bikers still on my mind. At Kalagada on the Kadapa-Chittoor border, I stopped to eavesdrop on a roadside argument. It was a farmer cursing strangers passing by. After the assembly had dispersed, I asked him his name. Riaz Ali Khan was a tomato farmer. He said he had lost seven lakh rupees on his last crop. I sowed three acres. Last year I sold for Rs 500 per box. Now they are offering me Rs 30 per box. Id rather let the fruit rot on the plants. I wont throw them on the road because I have respect for tomatoes, he said to me, still indignant.If it is your livelihood, you should respect the crop, right?Back on my route, the Veligalla reservoir suddenly appeared on the horizon and I looked for a tinge of green in the landscape around me. The land was barren. I stopped to talk to a farmer on a farm adjacent to the canal. He was working a kerosene-fuelled pump to irrigate his eight-acre groundnut crop. Im quite happy, he said to my surprise. Last year was fine. And the new year promises to be good too.How had demonetisation affected him? He managed, he said. I have a problem in getting small notes to pay my labourers, though. If I get good crop, Ill get a good price. I invested Rs 40,000 per acre and I should easily get Rs 80,000.He had a vermilion teeka on his forehead, so I asked him about Narendra Modi. If he waives crop loans, it will be good. he said.I moved on to Kadiri in Anantapur, Andhra Pradeshs drought district, as dusk descended. The town was dusty and the lights had not come on in the shops. I stopped to ask a watch repairer if there was a power cut. There is supply, sir. But traders are not switching on the lights because there is no business for them, the man said.His name was Zebi and he wanted to talk. Show me one shop with any customers. Look at my shop. Its only 5.30 and I am getting ready to close. Everyone wants to save money on power.Kadiri, in his telling, was a cursed town: no industries, no rains and no crops. We get drinking water for one hour once in three to four days and it has very high flouride content. If they dont do something, this town will die, Zebi declared.I then ducked into a basket weavers shop on the main street of Kadiri. Eshwaraiah did not have great expectations for the new year either. Bamboo baskets are on the way out. People are buying plastic baskets and tubs. Many basket weavers have moved to Bangalore to work as labourers."

The trend that started after Onam is expected to continue until March if not for any unexpected natural event.Of the 23 items under the tubers and vegetables category in the ESD list, 17 have lower prices than previous January with some like carrot and tomato showing over 40 per cent dip. Exceptions are elephant foot yam, tapioca, colocasia, cucumber, banana and plantain which recorded 4-56 per cent hike in prices.While the milk price is stable, a dozen white leghorn eggs now cost Rs 1.40 less. V P Jayakumar, a vegetable trader in Chalai market and a former office-bearer of the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi, said now there was a surplus supply of vegetables from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, unlike previous years.Prices are down after Onam and the situation is likely to continue until March, he said.Cereal is one category that survived the downfall trend and firmed up. Except Chamba rice, all other rice varieties showed an upward trend, 7-18 per cent growth from previous January. Sugar too recorded a 23 per cent growth. According to Satheesh R N, Supplycos marketing manager, the new governments decision to sell 13 commodities at the same rate during its tenure has helped control the prices of major cereals and pulses.The 1,400-odd outlets of Supplyco help our consumerist state to control food prices. Commodities other than the 13 classified items are sold at prices 40-50 per cent less than the market rate. FMCGs are sold at 2-30 per cent discount, he added."

A lot of problems in the agriculture sector are due to floods and droughts caused by climate change, Swaminathan said, adding focus should also be on providing convenient loans to women farmers to encourage participation.Right to Food campaigner Dipa Sinha dubbed the Budget a continuation of disappointments, especially for women and child welfare. There is focus on maternity benefit, which is good, but the funds allocated for it will not be sufficient for its universal applicability, she said. She was surprised that the finance minister chose to give malnutrition a pass, particularly after it was sharply brought to focus recently with several tragic deaths in Maharashtra."

Students are given lectures thrice a week on how to maintain the garden by urban farming groups like Start Upcycling Now (SUN) and iKheti, which helped the school to set up the garden.The project started in July 2016 after Father Gregory, the schools manager, roped in 240 students of Class 8 and explained the idea. Fascinated by the idea of having their own garden, the students immediately swung into action. Each class is divided into four sections and each division was assigned four gardens each.In a concrete jungle like Mumbai, a terrace garden awakens a sense of environmental consciousness and becomes a forum for knowledge. It also provides a variety of organic and fresh vegetables right at your doorstep, said Father Gregory.He added that a special period has been dedicated for the students to do the gardening work, which includes watering the plants, planting new vegetables, adding soil and compost or removing saplings, everything is done in the Work Experience period once a week.To execute the project, students created soil beds using clay bricks. A plastic sheet was spread on the brick base to prevent water from seeping through. Later, seven inch thick soil layer is spread on the plastic and is mixed with mulch comprising shredded cardboard and dry leaves. This helps soil to retain moisture even on the hot days.We should not just teach students phrases, but also make them apply those in real life. This is their real education. Now, they are so involved in it that they even utilise their recess time nurturing the plants, said Gracy Solomon, principal, OLPS.StudentspeakCommenting on the initiative, Razeen Sayyed, 13, said, We (each division) get 30 minutes with our respective gardens during which we must ensure that everything is fine with the crop. If everything is okay, and we are left with some time, we make self-irrigation bottles.The terrace garden produces brinjals, tomatoes, ladies fingers (okra), lemon grass, lemons and carom seeds (ajwain), which is appreciated not only by their treachers but also the monkeys who visit the garden in search of fresh vegetables.Monkeys eat our entire tomato crop. So to keep them at bay, we installed a scare crow, said Aaradhya Patil, 13.On each patch of garden, there are boards with information on the plants and their uses. For example, pentas plant is used as a popular medicine in malaria and lime to relieve asthma.Kids should understand how the plants are grown from scratch and that even a day of not watering can take away all their hard work, said Priyanka Shah, founder, iKheti, adding In this way, they also learn to respect food and become sensitive towards the environment.Organic fertilisersThe compost that they use in the garden comes from the waste created in the school campus. The school has eight drums in a set of four for each division where they dump organic waste, which is later used as fertiliser.Students do all the legwork they can for the environment. Aerobic composting is something that you just have to dump it and almost everything else is taken care of the microorganisms. The students of the school make sure that no waste goes out to the dump yard from the school, said Natasha DCosta, SUN founder.After the crop comes to fruition, the saplings are handed over to the students. Sanket Gauri, a student of Class VIII, said, We showed it to our parents and friends, and now even they want to be a part of it. My neighbours liked it so much that they want to start gardening on our terrace as well.The students are not just young environmentalists, but they are exceptional in studies as well. They recently won a Science Club Competition last year.My favourite subject is Maths, but this [terrace gardening] is Science, Chemistry, Geography and all other subjects put to practice, said Essakkimuthu Konar, 14, as he held his self-irrigation bottle with his name labelled on it.Also read: Teen powers change, helps buildings, schools recycle 350 kg of batteries"

Photos: P.K. Badiger and SANTOSH SAGAR: Farmers of two districts marked the new year in an unusual manner. Utter frustration and helplessness drove cabbage growers of some villages in Belagavi district to feed their fresh crop to cattle, while tomato growers in Raichur distributed the produce for free.The crash in prices is being attributed to a glut in the harvest as well as the shortage of cash caused by demonetisation. This has resulted in traders refusing procurement, or quoting low prices.The price of cabbage crashed to Rs. 1 to Rs. 1.2 a kg in some of the wholesale markets in Belagavi district whereas in November, it was selling at Rs. 700 to Rs. 800 a quintal.Tomato growers in Raichur are also in dire straits. When a few farmers brought their produce to the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee yard in Raichur, commission agents and traders refused to offer them more than Rs. 1 a kg. Helpless, they began giving away nearly six quintals of tomatoes for free in the Teenkandil locality of the city.Such a low price does not even meet the cost of cultivation, let alone transportation expenses, said a farmer. There is no point in taking the produce back home as not only is tomato a perishable commodity, it will also incur more transportation charges.A bountiful yield has hardly brought cheer to these farmers. Lakshmanagowda Kadgamdoddi, district president of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, alleged that the price crash was a strategy of APMC traders and commission agents, who purchase from tomato growers in other regions and States on credit.

The farmers say that traders were unwilling to buy because exports to Pakistan have stopped.""Exporters usually came in large numbers. But this year only a few showed up,"" said Ramesh Patel a trader from Kalyanpur. ""These are traders from Delhi, Haryana, and Punjab. Earlier, two trucks were loaded for Delhi, Punjab, and Pakistan daily, but this year only one truck is loaded every two days for Haryana and Punjab.""Interestingly, while farmers were finding it difficult to sell their produce even at Re 1 per kg, the wholesale price in the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), Ahmedabad, |ranged between Rs 2 and Rs 5 per kg. However, the retail price ranged between Rs 10 and Rs 20 per kg.Patel said that farmers of the area want the government to come forward and purchase the produce at about Rs 4 per kg so that farmers are able to get the basic cost if not profit. Patel said that on Tuesday no fewer than 20 tractors had come to sell their produce but traders, locally known as kantawalas, were not willing to buy. Rajesh Patel, another farmer from the area, said, ""Following tension on the border, purchase by traders has halved. Earlier, we were not willing to sell tomatoes to Pakistan, but now we hope that tension eases and we get some money."" Kaushik Patel, also a farmer from the area, said: ""The situation was so bad that farmers are now replacing their tomato crops with bajri."" Patel said that in his 7 bigah of land he gets around 6,000 kg per bigah of tomato. This year the crop was good compared to the previous years, he said."

Satyanarayana, medical officer attached to the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Fluorosis (NPPCF).Dental fluorosis and skeletal fluorosis are common in the western parts of the district, as the groundwater in over 1,100 villages has high fluoride content. So is the incidence of fluoride-induced CKD, especially in the mandals of Kangiri, P.C. Palli, Chandrasekarapuram and Pamur, where fluoride contamination is above 5 parts per million (ppm), he said in a conversation with The Hindu .The problem is severe in the villages of Bommireddipalle, Vengalayapalli, Neredepalli, Peddagogulapalle, Vaggampalle, Bandlamudi, Naidupalem, Lakshmipuram, Manchikalapadu, Bodavada, Narsapuram, Dharmavaram, Rajupalem and Balijapalem. Even in these villages, it is the vulnerable section of people who are suffering from CKD, while those taking a nutritious diet and without blood pressure and diabetes are not affected. Diet rich in calcium and magnesium like milk, leafy green vegetables, carrot, radish, raisins, peaches, apricots and dates and tomatoes can make a difference as it helps excrete fluoride through urine and bowel movement, he explains. According to the data available with the district officials, 345 people died of CKD since January 2015, while over 2,000 patients with white ration cards are undergoing treatment under NTR Aarogyasri in different hospitals.Fluoride toxicity increases following malfunctioning of the kidneys causing further damage to the kidneys, bones and other organs, explains Machiraju Ramachandra Rao, Resident Medical Officer at Sanghamitra hospital.Five per cent of the patients need dialysis and their lifespan can be increased by five to six years on an average, adds S. Sridhar Reddy, consultant nephrologist at the hospital.Drinking surface water is advised in view of contamination of groundwater with different types of minerals, says K. Krishnarjuna Rao, Medical Officer at the dailysis centre at the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences(RIMS), where 140 patients undergo dialysis twice a week.Lone demandA dialysis centre at Kanigiri is our only demand, says Sk. Mastan from Kangiri, while undergoing haemodialysis at the RIMS here.Visiting Ongole twice in a week along with an attendant means an additional expense of at least Rs. 4,000 per month for me, adds another patient M.

Cattle were also being fed with cauliflower, coriander leaves and brinjal among others on Saturday. A bumper production has led to the situation where the rates of vegetables especially tomato have nosedived. The perishable commodity in abundance was sold at Rs 10 a crate containing 10 kg in Bina, said Sunderlal Patel a farmer.""The middlemen or adhatiya in local language has been exploiting the farmers who has not been able to pay the transport charges to ferry the produce from farmlands to mandi,"" he said. He said the middlemen were also making small payments of Rs 100 by cheque. Patel said, it is better to feed the cattle with the fresh vegetables rather than sell it at throw away polices. In return, they may give more milk.Farmers would load tractor trollies and unload the produce before the cattle at home. Some villagers take them away for their cattle as well, said another farmer Babloo Kushwah, resident of Khimlasa village, 18 kms away from Bina. He said, ""I had spent Rs 25,000 on seeds, manures and maintenance of the crop to ensure a good crop. I did not expect such a low price, which does not even meet the cost of cultivation, let alone transportation expenses""In Ashoknagar, situation is even worse.

This ground reality appears to contradict the optimism expressed by the finance minister that increased sowing this year was an indicator of farmers' ""support"" for demonetisation.In Aligarh, Mathura and Agra, normal wheat sowing is done in the first fortnight of November. Because of the sudden note ban , it was delayed by 15-20 days, said farmers at Managarhi village in Mathura district. ""We used stored grain for sowing since there was no cash for buying. Other expenses are pending. Now the worry is, how to water this crop and arrange for fertilisers?"" said Raj Kumar, who has sown about five acres.The same worry haunts farmers in Etawah and Auraiya, although their normal sowing time is in the first week of December. Sadan Kumar from Ekghara village in Etawah has also used stored grain as seed and plans to use less fertilizer. Irrigation is a bigger concern because mostly pumps are used and this requires cash for diesel. For those who don't own a pumpset, buying water is a major expense at Rs 4,500 per acre, said Kundan Singh in Mathura.That the rabi crop is not getting required inputs of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides or fungicides is confirmed by traders. Sanjeev Yadav in Saifai and Ram Khilona Mishra in Bakewar are vendors of agri inputs. They told TOI that ""sales were down 30- 40%"" despite them offering some credit facilities.From Mathura in the west to Auraiya in central UP, growers of cauliflower, brinjal, potato, chillies, tomatoes, etc told TOI that vegetables sold for one fourth to one tenth of expected prices after note ban.""We have never seen such a time,"" said 80-year old Saudan Singh from Mitholi village in Mathura who sold his brinjal harvest for just 80p per kg and tomatoes for Rs 3 per kg in November.In Ankodia village in Etawah, Anoop Kumar said that cauliflower went for just Rs 5 per kg while potatoes dropped to Rs 2-3 per kg. While the kharif harvest of paddy and pulses like arhar was sold for lower prices in mandis, transactions were mostly done in the old notes till December end.As long as petrol pumps were allowed to accept the old notes, farmers would use payments from wholesale traders to buy diesel, said a trader in Etawah.But across the Chambal river near Etawah, in Bhind, MP, where the main crops are less water-requiring bajra, moong, urad and til, the mandi wears a haunted look as farmers are not selling their produce because they don't want to be paid in cheques. E-transactions are virtually absent.Says Akhtar Khan of Khanpur village in Auraiya, ""I haven't sown my four bighas. It is located near a forest area and requires a lot of care. Where will Iget the cash for all that?"""

While the district had set a target for including 20,000 farmers under the Indo-Israeli agro project, it received 60,000 applications.But things were not as rosy when the system was introduced with many farmers being apprehensive in adopting the method. ``Now, many have come forward to take it up'', said K Srinivasan, project officer for Centre for Excellence for Vegetables, Reddiarchathiram. As of now, there are about 30 farmers who had plumped for the method in the district.Polyhouse cultivation is a protected cultivation where the crops are safeguarded against natural influences like too much sunlight, rain or drought. The major water source for polyhouse or green house cultivation is micro drip irrigation, which ensures that the plants get adequate water.The farmers have to invest approximately Rs 10 lakh for a quarter acre, but they can get back the invested money in just two years as far as the hybrid variety of cucumber is concerned, according to Srinivasan. They initially started the cultivation with tomatoes and moved on to cucumber which is being cultivated in large areas.G Kathirvel Murugan from Kalikampatti panchayat in Dindigul has now started cultivating chrysanthemums in polyhouses and started seeing good returns. The ones that he planted in July have now started flowering. He had invested Rs 30,000 on the plants and Rs 44,000 on setting up the polyhouse. Compared to those grown under open cultivation which start fading from the third day onwards, flowers under protected cultivation have thicker petals and remain fresh even for five to ten days.On an average, plants on 1,000 square feet yield about 80 kilogram during peak season and sell at Rs 100 per kilogram. Srinivasan said that a farmer could earn about Rs 7,000 per day and quality chrysanthemums for two years.Hybrid cucumbers with a 130-day cycle would yield 20 tonnes per acre and the fruits would be ready for harvesting 35 days after sowing. A farmer can make a profit of up to Rs 25 lakh per acre in a season with the vegetable selling for Rs 22 per kilogram. A farmer in Bodikamanvadi near Battalagundu has reaped 27 tonnes per quarter acre in the last season, creating a record of sorts. A polyhouse once constructed can be used for twenty years, according to him.Polyhouse Versus Open field farmingPolyhouse - Open field1.Crops protected from natural weather - They are exposed to nature and conditions like excess sunlight and rain2.Drip irrigation enables water supply - Drought can lead to water scarcity3.They are protected from pests - Can be affected by pests4.Crops produce 60 % more yield than under open conditions5.Suitable for hybrid varieties - All traditional varieties are cultivated this way6.Assured returns - Returns depend on climatic conditions."
58e532c37be9e05a951f57d1,Glut and cash crunch spawn a tomato torment,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1170107/jsp/nation/story_129016.jsp,2017-01-07,,Telegraph,"Nagpur, Jan. 6: The monsoon was good this year, the climate perfect and the yield bumper. Sandeep Thavkar, 28, thought his tomatoes would fetch a tidy sum. Used to growing the traditional soybean or cotton, he had gambled on tomatoes on an acre and a half of his four-acre farmland after seeing the crop fetch better returns for his neighbours in Virkhandi, 65km from Nagpur, last year. But the prices crashed even before he had begun harvesting his tomatoes, a local variety, in mid-December. Last week, 25 crates of his tomatoes, each with 25kg of the vegetable, fetched just Re 1.20 a kg. At that price, he said, he could not recover even the labour charges, let alone the cost of transport and carting and the market agent's commission. Not to mention his input costs and family labour. After returning home on December 27, Sandeep borrowed his cousin Sachin's tractor. He drove it over his standing tomato crop on which he had toiled round the clock with his wife, an elder sister and an aunt for four months: planting, weeding, watering, standing guard against pests. He did it partly in despair and partly to cut his losses. ""Tomatoes are harvested till March. I have already spent Rs 50,000 and needed to spend another Rs 20,000 on pesticides and labour to maintain the rest of the crop,"" Sandeep said. ""That would have meant more losses. I could see the prices won't rise. I'd rather gamble on another crop today and harvest it by March-April to make up some of my losses,"" he said. Sandeep, who says a price of Rs 10 a kg would have merely helped him break even, insists the prices began tumbling after the November 8 note recall announcement. But local traders in Bhiwapur and Umred towns, 20km on either side of Virkhandi village, wouldn't blame the demonetisation entirely. ""A bumper crop resulted in the price crash,"" Banti Chakole, 38, said at Umred mandi. ""Vegetable prices do fall in November-December-January every year, and this year tomatoes are in abundance."" But he conceded that the prices nose-dived after November 8. ""I have to say I have never seen the situation this bad in my 20-year career."" ""Vegetable prices go down around this time of the year because of seasonality but perhaps cash shortage has been an additional factor,"" wrote Dr Ashok Kumar Lahiri, former chief economic adviser to the Indian government, in a recent paper on demonetisation, part of a series published by the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy. Data from Nagpur's agriculture produce market committee show a sharp difference in prices before and after the demonetisation. Before November 8, Bandu Ghormade of Chicholi, 50km from Nagpur, sold his tomatoes at Rs 8 a kg - a little low, perhaps because of the glut. Yesterday the price stood at Re 1 a kg. In 2015, tomato prices in December-January averaged Rs 15 a kg for the desi variety and Rs 37.5 for the export (hybrid) variety. But between November 1 and December 25 last year, the hybrid prices fell from an average Rs 29 a kg to Rs 5.50 a kg in 29 big markets across India, the National Horticulture Board's data show. In Raipur, hybrid tomato prices fell to Rs 4 a kg. The desi variety sold at 50 paise a kg in Chhattisgarh's Jashpur district, prompting farmers to dump several tonnes of tomatoes on highways in frustration. In Wardha town, 80km from Nagpur, farmer Pramon Ranit parked his tempo in the middle of a busy square on December 27 and gave away 400 kg of his tomatoes free in four hours. The nine-acre farmer had grown tomatoes over three acres, expecting to double his Rs 1 lakh investment. But when the traders offered Re 1 per kg, he decided to earn goodwill through charity instead. On January 2, news agency ANI reported that a group of farmers, members of the Yuva Pragatisheel Kisan Sangh, gave away about one lakh kilograms of vegetables, including tomatoes, free in Raipur in protest against the demonetisation. In Virkhandi, Sandeep is wondering what to plant on his forlorn patch, freshly flattened with a tractor. Should it be the guar (a kind of bean), the Indian round gourd (tinda in Hindi) or okra? Whatever it is, what's the guarantee it will fetch a profit? ""I'll need to check the market prices and take a gamble,"" he smiles wanly."

But in the past, Blumhouse Productions (founded by Jason Blum) has given us great scares in the form of horror series like Paranormal Activity , Insidious and The Purge . In fact, the company is responsible for The Hush , a 2016 horror thriller film that has an impressive 100 per cent holding on Rotten Tomatoes. Unfortunately, the company has hit a speed-bump by the name of Incarnate , perhaps the least scary possession film to ever grace a big screen.Wheelchair-bound Seth Embers (a thoroughly wasted albeit sincere Aaron Eckhart) can enter the subconscious minds of victims possessed by evil spirits. Hes handicapped after a car accident  caused by an inexplicably vindictive demon  that killed his wife and son. For years, hes been hunting Maggie as the evil entity has come to be known. Now shes taken a young boy hostage  one that looks eerily similar to his own deceased son  and Embers must evict the spirit from the boy. Theres also the Vatican involved in the form of a supremely attractive papal agent Camilla (Catalina Sandino Moreno), an unnecessary addition among many. Oh, and Lindsay, the possessed boys mother is played by Game of Throne s Carice van Houten. She so stoic, she barely tears up after witnessing the death of her estranged husband.To say Incarnate is derived is an understatement; there have been countless films with demon possessions. This writer didnt sleep for days after watching The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005). Yet, slumber was oh so sound after Incarnate , in fact perhaps even induced by the film. Lets spell it out in case there was any doubt: this film is a crashing bore.Why Eckhart would deign to waste his talent after films like Thank You for Smoking (2006) and Sully (2016) is something we will have to live with forever. Thats not to say the actor did not give it his best shot. Its just that everything is against him.When a director, in this case Brad Peyton (whose only credit is disaster film San Andreas ) hooks you up with the two assistants who look like theyve been ousted from a concert for being too wannabe punk, theres little a protagonist can do.Then theres Embers ability to enter other peoples subconscious, wheres hes got full use of his legs and dressed to the nine, nonetheless. Its all so convenient and cheesy. You see the process is not religious, so it cant be termed exorcism. Embers uses science to evict a spirit from a body with several monitors and medical equipment to trace the movements of the parasite inside a host. Basically, its tripe. Last and definitely not least are those possessed with their black eyes; more amusing than scary. Incarnate has no scares, thrills or chills and a glaring lack of originality. What little gore has been incorporated will be censored. So give it a miss, if you value your time and money.DEBORAH CORNELIOUS"

File photo: C. VenkatachalapathyWith the start of a new year, affordable prices are something that many consumers would look for. For a week now, mixed prices are prevailing in the vegetable markets, as traders say that the price of few vegetables have shot up, while the cost of a few have dropped, and these rates are here to stay for at least another week.The last week of 2016 saw the price of some vegetables such as onions, beans and broad beans (avarakkai) shoot up due to various reasons, according to A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam.The rates of beans and avarakkai have increased in the last two days. This is primarily because the quality of vegetables is good but the supply is less. Many consumers are purchasing the two vegetables and this has hiked the prices. These vegetables are supplied from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, he said.From costing Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 earlier, the rate of one kilo of beans has doubled toRs. 30 now, while the price of avarakkai has gone up from Rs. 15 to Rs. 25.All is not well with onions too. Mr. Balu said the onions supplied from Andhra Pradesh that were of medium size and even smaller used to be sold for Rs. 5 or Rs. 6 in Vellore.Now, the supply from AP has stopped, and onions from parts of Maharashtra such as Pune and Ahmednagar have started to arrive. Those procuring the stock have to pay Rs. 5 per kilo on commission and toll. So, onions are sold at Rs. 15 to Rs. 20 to fetch profit, he said.He added that it would take at least a week for the price of onions supplied from Maharashtra to stabilise.Drumsticks rate has also gone up as the mist affected flowering and yield. It was sold for Rs. 80.The rate of peas, which are usually priced high, could come as a surprise.

58e53ec07be9e05a951f65ea,MORE THAN JUST COMMUNISM,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1170101/jsp/nation/story_127948.jsp,2017-01-01,,Telegraph,"In India, the Russian Revolution and communism have come to be synonymous. But there was a time when it was not so, and a centennial year is an occasion when it is worth remembering the more complex story of inspiration and legacy that came of the events of 1917 in Russia. True, this is not easily done. By the time of Soviet disintegration in 1991, in India as in much of the world, remembering the Russian Revolution was a communist ritual, dutifully conducted on November 6. This has continued to the present. The Indian communist party press  New Age, Deshabhimani, Navayug, Ganashakti and many others  produced the striking red-edged supplements with a somewhat benign-looking Lenin staring at the world to mark the occasion. Inside, there have figured assemblages of the grand narrative of the 20th century  the rise of Soviet power and the global projection of the communist challenge, suitably adjusted to tell the nations story of communism from S.A. Dange and Muzaffar Ahmad to E.M.S. Namboodiripad, with sharp asides on which party had failed to observe which line. Meetings have tended to take place at Lenin statues through the country. The celebrations have mainly followed at Ajoy Bhavan or the communes off the Asaf Ali Road in Delhi or in places of congregation on a par with Bhupesh Bhavan in Calcutta. There would be CPI cha on offer  without milk and with a touch of lemon  a throwback to the Russian traditions that M.N. Roy, the Indian Comintern leader, noted in Moscow in 1920. This was the normal fare at Indo-Soviet communist meetings along with plates of cucumber, tomato and cheese delicately sliced with salami thrown in for non-vegetarians. Through all the fanfare, the events marked a further year of solidarity during the Cold War, and after 1991, everything that was left behind. This was solidarity built not only on political parties and trades unions but one that permeated a larger ambience. Communism and stories of the Russian Revolution were associated with the illustrated output of Soviet presses and the Peoples Publishing House that were distributed in schools  with the strains of communist marches and melodies of the communist cultural movements that were passed around on Melodiia records, magnetic tapes or CDs. The more fervent followers of communism listened to the Bengali services of Moscow Radio and the odd broadcast from the Peoples Republic of China, the former introduced by the telltale lilt of the popular song Evenings in Moscow. After 1991, the old faithful continued to look back with nostalgia. Significantly, there were marked divisions. The Revolution was celebrated independently in China and the Soviet Union, who had their own take on the occasion. In India, different parties had their own stories and legends to pass around  whether the SUCI or the RSP, CPI, CPM or the CPML. Outside the communist fraternity, newspapers docketed the experience and restricted themselves to noting one more year of the observance of its origin by the communist world from Cuba to Korea  the ritual, not the event, attracting comment. American Sovietologists pored over who was seen closest to whom at what podium in Moscow, where all spontaneity had been wrung out of the event by the heavy bureaucracy of the Soviet communist party. This harked to a complexity to the way the Revolution was received in the past but one that seldom attracted comment in the present, least of all in the USSR, which barred its own citizens let alone foreigners from free access to the archives dealing with the foundations of the Soviet state. In India, it was an unusual story. Socialism, let alone communism, attracted little discussion before 1917 and the Bolshevik uprising of October 25 (by the Julian Calendar). True, on October 23, when the now-forgotten Indian revolutionary, Virendranath Chattopadhyay, the villain of Somerset Maughams Ashenden stories, made contact with the Bolshevik establishment, he had already made interventions in socialist circles in Stockholm. But he was a true-blue nationalist who had a smattering of reading on the Left  his awareness not much off that of Har Dayal, who authored a book on Marx. For them, the Russian Revolution produced a sense of liberation  taking place as it did in the largest country in the world and one of the major powers of the day. Admirers of Russian revolutionaries, Indian revolutionaries were deeply moved by the fall of the Tsarist autocracy in February 1917. But Russias Provisional Government refused to provide even tacit support to the Indian revolutionaries based in Kabul (Mahindra Pratap, Mohammad Barkatullah and others). Bolshevik power re-ignited the magic. Not because it was a communist revolution but because it held out promise for national emancipation and, most emphatically, from its early days committed Bolshevik Russia to a quest for Indias freedom. A number of Indian revolutionaries rallied around Bolshevism during the Russian Civil War, appearing at the Baku Congress of the Workers of the East in 1920. Communism threatened to overlay nationalism on the Bolshevik agenda for India, after M.N. Roys formation of the Communist Party of India in October 1921 in Tashkent. And many duly left the ranks of fellow travellers, most well known being the revolutionaries Abdur Rab and M.P.B.T. Acharya. But, once again, the development of a Soviet civilisation model during the 1920s and 1930s, for all its inner tragedy and oppression, drew the attention of Rabindranath Tagore, Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose and, significantly, the future Swatantra Party leader Minoo Masani. As planning came to shape Indias industrial growth after 1947, the economists of the Indian Statistical Institute and the finance ministry in Delhi engaged with Moscow and Beijing to draw on their experience. The language of the Second Five Year Plan declared its socialist character  though the socialism would be home-grown and forged against the background of conflict with the CPI in Andhra and Kerala. From all this emerges the solid fact that Indias modern national ethos evolved in the shadow of the Russian Revolution; the symbols and practices of the October Revolution that was born from it entered the pattern of Indias state construction. Before and during the Cold War, the legacy of the revolution symbolised global alternatives and provided support to nationalism in an era where the countrys liberationist urges had only popular enthusiasm to back them: where a new crop of national leaders sought to be more than understudies to the great powers of the day. For India, the Russian Revolution was more than communism. It deeply marked the countrys coming of age.

58e543017be9e05a951f6b66,Vegetable spoilage? Try solar cart,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1170102/jsp/nation/story_128080.jsp,2017-01-02,,Telegraph,"New Delhi, Jan. 1: India's roadside vegetable vendors may soon get a chance to turn to the sun for reduced drudgery and a bit more take-home money. Scientists in New Delhi have designed a solar-powered vending cart that may help increase the shelf life of vegetables and alleviate the vendors' grind of sprinkling water on their vegetables on hot days. The solar power panels atop the cart generate electricity to evaporatively cool a closed chamber just beneath the vending platform, lowering the temperatures inside by 8C to 11C, the scientists at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) said. In field tests during summer, the evaporatively cooled cart - which requires about 20 litres of water a day - was able to keep fruits and vegetables fresh for two to five days compared to conventional carts where most vegetables spoil in less than two days. ""The evaporative cooling of the chamber is similar to the way desert coolers work,"" David Samuel, an agriculture engineering specialist at the IARI, told The Telegraph . The solar electricity powers a battery to run a fan blowing cooled air in the lower chamber that stores vegetables. Crop scientists estimate that about 35 per cent of India's annual fruits and vegetables harvested is lost through spoilage, primarily because of poor storage, and that much of these losses occur at roadside vending carts. Street-side vendors typically keep their vegetables on or within wet gunny bags or repeatedly sprinkle water on the vegetables on hot days. While this has a cooling effect, it also contributes to spoilage, with green leafy vegetables, tomatoes and cucumbers among others lasting only two days. When fruits or vegetables lose about 10 per cent of their weight through heat-driven moisture loss, they wilt, look bad and keep customers away. Vendors are forced to lower prices as vegetables approach spoilage and discard spoilt produce, losing income. The field tests by the IARI research group suggests that the evaporatively cooled vending cart can help maintain the freshness of vegetables, assessed through colour, texture and coarse appearance, for an average of five days, even longer for some vegetables - cabbage remained usable for 10 days and cauliflower and carrots for seven days inside the cooled chamber. ""The solar power vending cart is ideal for hot and dry weather,"" said Pramod Sharma, an agricultural engineering researcher who led the field experiments. The IARI scientists have published the results of their field tests in the journal Current Science. The IARI team estimates the solar-powered vending cart could be made available for about Rs 30,000, and the umbrella-like solar panel atop the cart's platform, the fan-and-cooling system, and the battery would increase the cart's weight by about 5kg to 8kg."

But in the past, Blumhouse Productions (founded by Jason Blum) has given us great scares in the form of horror series like Paranormal Activity , Insidious and The Purge . In fact, the company is responsible for The Hush , a 2016 horror thriller film that has an impressive 100 per cent holding on Rotten Tomatoes. Unfortunately, the company has hit a speed-bump by the name of Incarnate , perhaps the least scary possession film to ever grace a big screen.Wheelchair-bound Seth Embers (a thoroughly wasted albeit sincere Aaron Eckhart) can enter the subconscious minds of victims possessed by evil spirits. Hes handicapped after a car accident  caused by an inexplicably vindictive demon  that killed his wife and son. For years, hes been hunting Maggie as the evil entity has come to be known. Now shes taken a young boy hostage  one that looks eerily similar to his own deceased son  and Embers must evict the spirit from the boy.Theres also the Vatican involved in the form of a supremely attractive papal agent Camilla (Catalina Sandino Moreno), an unnecessary addition among many. Oh, and Lindsay, the possessed boys mother is played by Game of Throne s Carice van Houten. She so stoic, she barely tears up after witnessing the death of her estranged husband.To say Incarnate is derived is an understatement; there have been countless films with demon possessions. This writer didnt sleep for days after watching The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005). Yet, slumber was oh so sound after Incarnate , in fact perhaps even induced by the film. Lets spell it out in case there was any doubt: this film is a crashing bore.Why Eckhart would deign to waste his talent after films like Thank You for Smoking (2006) and Sully (2016) is something we will have to live with forever. Thats not to say the actor did not give it his best shot . Its just that everything is against him.DEBORAH CORNELIOUS"

How are things? I asked the man selling Prasad. Very bad, Hukum (Sir), he replied in a feeble voice. By this time of the year, thousands of people should have arrived here. The tourists are just not coming! Although by the time December 25 ended, the tourists began arriving and the hotel occupancy was full again.Tanot is a place where the Pakistani army dropped dozens of bombs during the 1965 war. Several of these bombs also dropped in the temple complex, but miraculously none of them exploded. The locals attribute this to the blessings of the Devi and that is why the temple is always thronged by local and outstation tourists. But at the time I visited it, the temple was deserted.The situation was not very different at the clock-tower located in the heart of Jodhpur. Here, vendors have set up stalls to sell handicrafts. My wife stood before a tribal lady selling junk jewellery. We were her first customers of the day. According to the lady, during winter, by the end of the afternoon, most people return home after selling their stock. The afternoon was almost over, but the stalls selling handicraft hadnt got too many buyers.Read: Demonetisation: Window to deposit banned notes nears end as Modi eyes key electionsThe decision on demonetisation has wreaked havoc on farmers, labourers and those who live on the margins. A research-based report in Hindustan Times this week talked about how farmers around the country were forced to sell their vegetables at wholesale mandis at minuscule prices.Onions sold for just Rs 1 per kilogramme in Madhya Pradeshs Mandsaur and tomatoes for Rs 3 a kg in Karnatakas Kolar. Cauliflower sold for Rs 3 per kg in Patna, peas for Rs 3 in Chandigarh and potatoes for just Rs 2 in Farrukhabad.Clearly the farmers are likely to spend the next few months in deprivation.Small industry has also been hit hard and forced to cut jobs. The government in Uttar Pradesh has even doled out a compensation of Rs 2 lakh each to 14 families whose loved ones died while waiting in ATM queues. Opposition parties say the number of people whove met an untimely death in this manner is more than hundred. The 50-day time limit that the prime minister had sought has ended. But people are still awaiting relief from cashlessness. When I passed through the village Bharol in Uttar Pradeshs Ferozabad district, I saw dozens standing in queues to draw money from an ATM. It was the 50th day of demonetisation.Because of these reasons, the Opposition, which had been in a semi-unconscious state for the last two and a half years, has suddenly found an opportunity to become aggressive. As 2017 begins, they want to put up a united front and evolve a combined strategy to corner the prime minister.So many aspersions wouldnt have been cast on the Union government had a few bank officials and their cronies hadnt found ways to dispense the new currency to turn their black money into white. It was highly unfortunate that at a time most bank employees were working day and night to alleviate the side-effects of demonetisation, some of their colleagues were busy sullying the image of the entire banking system. At one time, George Fernandes had said that wherever multinational banks had gone, they had encouraged corruption. Years later, his comment is ringing true. Most of those tainted were private bank employees. Employees of public sector banks also alleged that a larger number of currency notes were made available to private banks.This is an allegation that needs to be investigated.Read: We are with the Prime Ministers demonetisation drive: JD(U)Over the last few days, crores of currency has been recovered in raids across the country. The prime minister has been repeatedly warning at public forums that those still sitting on heaps of illegal currency should mend their ways. In 2017 no mercy will be shown to them. One hopes the government has set its sights on the big fish. The people still have confidence in the prime minister. And the man on the street is with him.Those who jump to hasty conclusions believe the PM has failed in his ambitious endeavour. Is that true? To find an answer, we return to the lady selling junk jewellery in Jodhpur. I asked her if she knew who had taken the decision to demonetise currency. Modiji, she replied. Is that a good thing or bad? The lady anxiously waiting for her first sale had her answer ready: Its good. Similarly workers engaged in repairing the Khama Fort near Jaisalmer said they were poor people. Theyd braved odds all their life but were confident that Mr Modi will set everything right.Clearly the common mans confidence in Modi hasnt been shaken. To keep it going, the Centre will have to make a Herculean effort. A lot will also depend on the manner in which the Indian economy responds. Assembly elections are due in five states including Uttar Pradesh in the next few months. Apart from a verdict on the incumbent governments in these states, these elections will also be a referendum on this bold initiative. If the prime minister and his colleagues can overcome this challenge, his popularity will rise more than any of his predecessors. If that doesnt happen, hell have to spruce up his politics once more, since the assembly polls of 2017 could well script the prologue to the 2019 general elections.Last, but not the least, greetings for the New Year! Indians exhausted of playing a Holi of political mudslinging can nurture a small hope in 2017: That this year brings with it a lot of things that make us feel cleaner.Shashi Shekhar is editor-in-chief, Hindustan"

(Hardeep Singh) The humble litti of Bihar-Jharkhand is on the roast for bon vivants from across the world. Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), the event manager of the Global Investors' Summit (GIS) in Ranchi, has roped in grub start-up GoLitti for the GIS food court in Hotwar on February 16-17 and the latter hopes to take the desi litti places with its trendy Chinese and Italian range of the traditional atta-sattu preparation. GoLitti - the state's lone branded litti joint that opened shop at Eastern Mall on Dangratoli Road only last month - is the brainchild of three friends, two of them BIT-Mesra alumni and the third a chartered accountant who left a plum job with Goldman Sachs in Bangalore to realise a big dream out of a small dough. Recalling his amazing culinary journey along with school friends and businessmen Kamal Bagla (23) and Sameer Kataruka (24), chartered accountant-turned-food manager Ankush Raj (23) told this newspaper how the inherent desire to make the homemade litti popular like the samosa or momo gave birth to GoLitti. ""A few years ago, when I moved to Delhi for my CA studies, I missed our litti-chokha, which is basically a super healthy baked dough ball stuffed with sattu (chickpea flour) and served with roasted and mashed potatoes, tomatoes, onion, chillies and spices. I shared my cravings with my Bridgeford School pals Kamal and Sameer one day, months later, and all of a sudden we had the idea,"" said Ankush. Raising a brand from a drawing room idea was no easy task. ""But, if there's will, there's a way. I quit Goldman Sachs in September last year and came to Ranchi. My businessmen friends, who are BBA graduates from BIT-Mesra, backed my dream while my mother Rita Sinha (49), a great cook, helped us rediscover litti in many avatars,"" Ankush said. GoLitti was born on January 15 this year, and is already a hot favourite with local residents and visitors alike, which includes representatives of the CII. ""We sell litti under two categories - evergreen and trendy. The first comprises the traditional baked variety along with Jain (no onion and garlic) and ghee-fried. The trendy menu boasts manchurian, schezwan, shashlik, corn, paneer, dahi, matar and mixed vegetable varieties among others,"" Ankush said, adding that officials of CII liked their preparations so much that the invite to join the GIS food court was almost immediate. And all this for just Rs 40 to Rs 95 a plate! ""We wanted to make litti loveable for all and we did it. Nothing pleases us more than when customers exclaim 'wow' after tasting our food. We will open a second joint in Ranchi in April. We are keeping fingers crossed and hoping that the summit will help us take GoLitti global,"" Ankush added."

Telegraph picture Balipada, Feb. 14: The small weekly village haat in Govindpur gram panchayat of Kantapada block in Cuttack district was buzzing with excitement today when Odia film stars reached here to campaign for Independent candidate Prashant Mohanty aka Jhallia Bhai for the panchayat poll. While the BJD has roped in all the big names among film stars for campaigning, those who have not joined the BJD today chose to campaign here for Independent candidates. The election to the gram panchayat will be held on February 17. As soon as the film stars reached the haat, people from all corners of Govindpur village - which has traditionally been considered a BJD bastion - flocked to the weekly market to catch a glimpse of them. The small-time traders of the haat also rushed to hear what all the film stars had to say, leaving their work behind. Film stars Amulya Patnaik, Debidatta Barik, Leena and Sabita, visited the Govindpur haat today. Asked why they had joined the campaign, Debidatta Barik said: ""We film stars are part of society. We joined the campaign to tell people that they should elect the right candidates. We are campaigning here for Jhallia Bhai whose son is a major in the Indian Army and is busy protecting our motherland. It is our duty to support him. We are not taking any money for this."" As soon as Barik completed his speech, the villagers rushed to shake hands with the actors. ""We have watched them in various films and serials. We are happy to see them in person here,"" said Bachhana Mallick. Even though the sarpanch seats are not contested on the party lines, people have a fair idea about the candidates whom the major parties are backing. The BJP, which has not been able to make substantial inroads in the coastal belt yet, is now slowly gaining ground. BJP flags were noticed in many villages in Govindpur and other parts of Niali Assembly constituency. While there is a fair chance that many Independent candidates will do well in the sarpanch election, the BJD is going to face a tough fight from the BJP for the first time in the zilla parishad elections. The Congress is also making all-out efforts to make its presence felt in the state. ""We will not reveal who we are going to vote for. We will follow certain criteria in selecting the candidates. For the sarpanch, we will elect a candidate who is honest and can do something good for the villages. But for the zilla parishad, we will pick the party candidates. However, I cannot reveal who I am going to vote for,"" said tomato seller Bhibhu Das. As soon as the road show ended at Govindpur, the film stars moved to another village. ""It is really a good experience to be part of the panchayat poll campaign. My suggestion to people is that they should exercise their voting rights and take part in the election process,"" said one actor."

The school grounds turned into a fun space and students, their parents, grandparents and teachers had a good time. The games stalls put up by students and teachers kept everyone busy. Also available was an array of lip-smacking food. We danced and had a lot of fun, said Madhureem Banerjee, a student of Class VII. Principal Indrani Sanyal was happy at the popularity of the event and the increase in footfall. Its a place to enjoy. Even some grandparents dropped in and had who are enjoying their time. There is so much of joy in the air. Every one is enjoying themselves. The proceeds from the carnival will be invested in a village that we have adopted in Rajarhat. Selina Nwulu, young poet laureate for London, visited DPS Megacity for a workshop with the students. The students expected to see a poet but Nwulu turned out to be a writer and researcher focusing on social justice, politics, education and gender while also being a strong environment and human rights campaigner. She reminded the students that as poet, she has her writing to be used as a powerful tool which could effect change in a variety of fields. She captivated the students for an hour and a half. THE BSS SCHOOL Melange 2016, the annual fete of The BSS School, was an occasion to bond over good food, music and games. Students, former and current, and their parents joined the happy celebrations. Game stalls included hunting for objects from a bucket full of sand and taking aim with a ball to topple a pyramid made of plastic glasses. While these activities kept visitors engaged, the fare at the food stalls ensured that they did not go hungry. Quetzal Club whipped up tomato and sweet corn soup and butter corn, while cupcakes from Calcutta Cupcakes provided the perfect sweet ending. A guest performance by Samantak and Mates was the cherry on the cake. This is my first year at The BSS School and I was quite nervous as I had to shoulder quite a few responsibilities. However, I am happy that everyone loved the arrangements, said Sriroopa Dutta, a Class XI student. Text: Samabrita Sen, Farah Khatoon, Sarthak Ganguly, Tanisha Bagchi & Chandrajit Mitra; pictures: B.

PHOTO: N. BASHKARANN_BASHKARANA 25-year-old female elephant was shot dead by two men in Ulipandaa village on the fringes of Jawalagiri reserve forest on Monday night.The animal was found dead with two bullet injuries on her forehead on Tuesday morning by the locals, who alerted the officials. The elephant was part of a small migratory herd from the North Cauvery Wild Life Sanctuary that stretches from Karnataka to Tamil Nadu.The accused, whose identity was not known, were from the same village and had allegedly indulged in wild boar hunting in Ulipandaa in the past. Hunting of wild boars is an offence in Tamil Nadu, though the Central government had declared the species to be vermin in a few States.On Monday night, the accused A.Basavaraj (34), son of Anumadhappa, and his friend T.Madesh, son of Thimmarayappa, were reportedly waiting in a tomato field. Basavaraj had taken the land adjoining the tomato field on lease for cultivation.The duo and three other men were waiting for the wild boar, when they spotted the elephant grazing afar. Basavaraj allegedly used his country-made gun to shoot down the elephant.On Tuesday morning, a team consisting of officials from the Forest Department, including Conservator of Forests, Dharmapuri, Ashish Kumar Srivastava, District Forest officer, Hosur, Rajendran, along with Hosur Sub Collector Senthil Raju, accompanied by the police reached Ulipanda on receiving the alert from locals.The Forest Department has booked the men under Section 9, 39 and 51 of Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, and under Section 25(1)(A) of the Indian Arms Act 1959; and under Section 9 B (1) (b) Indian Explosive Substance Act , 1908.The police arrested Madesh and picked up two others in the village, while the prime accused, Basavaraj, is not traceable.Firing unprovokedMr. Srivastava told The Hindu that the accused could not have shot the elephant in self-defence as there were no signs of aggression.A Revenue Department official similarly, said the the accused had taken time to aim at the head of the elephant that was grazing at a distance.A parallel report will be submitted by the Revenue Department to the government.The three-tonne elephant could not be shifted along the difficult unmotorable terrain of the village. Hence, an autopsy was carried on the spot and was buried at the same spot.Quite a few instances of shooting with illegal country-made guns in Thally and Denkanikottai area have been reported over personal enmity."

Prakash Kammardi. This situation has arisen as there is a bountiful harvest of various crops because of good rains in other States as well as countries. Either the cheap crops from other States are entering our markets or there is no demand for our produce in other markets because of glut in their own areas, he said.It is like rubbing salt into the wound of farmers who have already suffered crop losses owing to serious drought or floods as they may have to not only suffer reduction in yield, but also crash in the prices, notes the The Perspective and Forecasting report by the KAPC.According to the commissions report, what has complicated the matter is the impact of demonetisation. This has prevented the recovery of prices of some crops besides leading to a dip in the price of others owing to poor cash flow in the markets, Dr. Kammardi said.The commissions report has pointed out that the prices of tomato and onion have crashed by 84 per cent and 70 per cent respectively, when compared with the earlier level; and that of copra and arecanut have seen a dip of 47 per cent and 7 per cent respectively after demonetisation.The commission has suggested to the State government to take up the issue with NABARD as well as the Union government to increase the daily money withdrawal limit for farm traders in agricultural produce marketing committees (APMC) in the interest of farmers.Pointing out that the norms related to monetary withdrawal limits from banks were relaxed for tea growers of some areas, Dr. Kammardi sought similar benefit to be extended to APMCs as nearly 41 per cent of the trading of farm produce takes place in these markets.This is one of the worst harvest seasons for farmers in terms of prices in the last several decades. This has resulted owing to glut in production in other States/countries coupled with the impact of demonetisation.T.N. Prakash Kammaradi, Chairman, Karnataka Agriculture Price Commission"

A tomato vendor waits for customers at Urma in Purulia. Picture by Mita Roy Farmer Balaram Kisku, who has cultivated around 100 quintals of tomato in Purulia in November-December, has been feeding a part of his produce to cattle instead of letting it rot in the fields. Agriculture department officials said the demand for tomato was all the more hit because people in eastern India can do without the fruit-vegetable in the kitchen, unlike potato or onion. According to the officials, around 1,000 tomato farmers had been hit in Purulia and Bankura. ""I sold tomato at Rs 20 a kg between October and November. The demand started falling in the middle of November and with it, the price too came down. The situation has come to such a pass that I am being forced to sell a bucket of tomato (around 20-22kg) for only Rs 10 to the wholesalers,"" said Kisku, a resident of Hatinada village on the Ayodhya hills. The vegetable trade has been hit hard in rural Bengal, where wholesalers depend on cash and digital transactions are still a hard nut to crack. ""The cash crunch has left vegetable farmers in serious trouble. The situation is worse for tomato growers because people can do without tomato for days. If people have cash, they would rather spend on potato than tomato,"" an agriculture department official said. In Purulia and Bankura, farmers usually grow tomato between October and March. Officials said the dry climate in the two districts and the hilly terrain are conducive to growing tomato. In the last season, about 3,000 tonnes of tomato had been supplied to various parts of the country from Purulia and Bankura. But this time, the demand has plunged several notches. Ramesh Pandit, a Dhanbad-based tomato wholesaler who owns a warehouse in Purulia's Balarampur, said around 150 quintals of the fruit-vegetable were lying unsold with him. Sources in the agriculture department said a good production this time had added to the trouble of tomato wholesalers in Bengal, which has very few multipurpose cold storage and processing units."

But as the week proceeded, and the alliance talks got stuck, jubilation turned into despondency  especially among Muslims, the community that has driven this alliance more than any other.In Bareilly, barely 24 hours before the SP-Congress alliance was officially announced on Sunday, a young Muslim journalist who writes for local Urdu papers, said: When Akhilesh got the cycle, there was great excitement; today, there is a sense of hopelessness in the community. The alliance must happen.In western U.P.s 125 Assembly constituencies, the Muslims are the single largest bloc, roughly 38 per cent of the population (across the State, it is 18 per cent).For Muslims, the Modi government has heightened its sense of insecurity, with the free run it has given RSS outfits to run campaigns targeted against them  from love jihad and ghar wapsi to cow protection vigilantism. There is a determination, therefore, in the community to use its numbers to influence next months poll results.Community divisionsClass, educational backgrounds and even caste may divide the community, but an overwhelming majority is rooting for Akhilesh Yadav and a SP-Congress alliance, from lawyers in Muzaffarnagar, to madrasa students in Bareilly, to businessmen and artisans alike in Moradabad, to tomato farmers in Sambhal.Their reasons vary: if students and young farmers see Akhilesh bhaiyya as emblematic of their aspirations, Urdu scholar Murtaza Iqbal in Moradabad says, The SP is the flip side of the BJP, with its politics also helping to polarise votes. But Akhilesh, unlike his father Mulayam Singh, is seen as non-partisan. And if the Congress joins the alliance, it will have a moderating influence on the SP.For the SP-Congress alliance, there is, of course, one major obstacle, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), that has a major advantage in western UP  the Jataav vote that is about 14 per cent in this belt and which is going to turn out in full strength for it.In addition, with the most backward castes having largely deserted her, BSP supremo Mayawati has been promoting the idea of a Dalit-Muslim alliance in this election. She has given 97 seats to members of the community, with 36 from this region of the State.This poses a challenge to the SP, for whom the Muslims are the base vote in western UP. But as I travelled through the districts of Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Saharanpur, Bijnor, Moradabad, Bareilly and Badayun, it was clear Muslims will only vote for the BSP when they find the SP-Congress candidate cannot defeat the BJP.Of course, there are instances such as in the Swar constituency, where SP strongman Azam Khans rookie son Abdullah is pitted against the BSPs Kazim Ali Khan, the Nawab of Rampur: the Muslim votes could get divided here.As for the Congress, its eight per cent votes will come in handy for the SP, as it is likely to chip away at the BJPs upper caste votes.People are not prepared to give it a starring role in Battleground UP, but feel it will play a competent supporting role.As a young government in Badayun said, We want a milijuli sarkar (a coalition government); enough of these Hitlers."

I will be filing a PIL against the Prime Minister as to why criminal procedures not be initiated against the PM for crippling the rural economy,"" Raina said, adding he was consulting his lawyers. Raina, the president of the Haryana Agro Forestry Farmers' Association, said the note ban had crippled the wood industry in the BJP-ruled state and resulted in huge lay-offs. He claimed the industry had to shut down for a month after demonetisation while potato, tomato and fruit growers were hit so hard that they had been forced to sell their produce below cost. Raina, who hails from Kurukshetra, claimed he had been an active member of the BJP since 2006 and was working with the Muslim Rashtriya Manch, led by RSS leader Indresh Kumar. The Manch describes itself as an association of ""nationalist Muslims and functionaries of the RSS"". BJP leaders claimed they did not know Raina and declined comment on his assertions. ""Anybody can claim he is a BJP member. How can one react to somebody's claim?"" said a BJP national secretary, refusing to be quoted on record. Kumar, the Manch leader, could not be contacted. Raina, however, said he was a ""responsible citizen"" and came from an ex-servicemen family where many had won bravery awards. He claimed many in the BJP and the RSS felt demonetisation had wrecked the nation's economy but were not speaking out because of personal reasons. Raina said he had written a letter to the Prime Minister and sought his resignation, allegedly over deaths caused by the note ban. He repeated the demand today and called upon the BJP to elect a new leader. ""All over India, the situation is catastrophic and frightening due to demonetisation...The Prime Minister has to take the onus of these deaths and step down with immediate effect. Let the BJP members of the Lok Sabha take a decision to elect another Prime Minister,"" Raina has said in the letter. A copy has been sent to L.K.

Picture by Ashwinee Pati Bhubaneswar, March 4: A group of farmers today spilled milk and throw vegetables on the road to protest against the government's apathy leading to their crop loss and distress sale. The farmers' wing of the state BJP led the agitation near the Assembly and mobilised the peasants to protest against the ""apathetic attitude"" of the state government on the concluding day of the first phase of Assembly session. The protest, however, failed to make a mark as was evident from agriculture minister Pradeep Maharathy's speech in the House. Maharathy today said Hadu Bagarti, the Bargarh farmer who recently committed suicide due to alleged crop loss, died because of family feud and not crop loss. Making a statement in the House, Maharathy said: ""I have received the district collector report, which says Hadu Bagarti had consumed poison following a bitter quarrel with his wife."" It was alleged that Bagarti committed suicide by consuming poison on Monday following crop loss. But, the minister said: ""There was no crop loss. But, he had an altercation with his wife as to whether manure and pesticide should be given in the land."" While Opposition members decried the government version in the House, hundreds of farmers gathered at PMG Square and spilled milk and dumped vegetables on the road. They had demanded compensation for crop loss and establishment of adequate cold storages where they could preserve their produces. BJP Krushak Morcha president Shivaji Mohanty blamed lack of storage facilities and marketing opportunities for the crop loss and distress sale. ""This forces farmers to sell tomatoes at 25 paise per kg and brinjal and cabbages at Re 1 per kg,"" said Mohanty. He said the financial condition of the state's farmers was deteriorating rapidly, forcing them to commit suicide. ""Dairy farmers are another neglected lot. They do not have storage facility and government apathy is contributing to loss for them,"" said Mohanty. This is not the first time that farmers dumped their produce on roads to mark protest in the state. Earlier this month, the farmers had also dumped tomatoes in front of the Keonjhar collector's office. Last year, dairy farmers had spilled gallons of milk on roads in Bargarh and Puri. ""The government is not bothered about our situation. They only claim that they are pro-farmer, but the ground reality is different. They are not providing us necessary inputs and the lack of cold storage forces us to sell our produces at lower rates,"" said Bimbadhar Jena, a protesting farmer. On the other hand, dairy farmers reiterated their demand to include milk as an item in midday meal. ""If the government includes milk in the midday meal scheme, it will not only provide nutrition to students, but also help us sell our produce. The government should revise the sale price of milk to Rs 30 a litre,"" said dairy farmer Jhagadu Yadav. Social workers and activists also backed the protest and urged the government to address farmers' plight. ""We are an agrarian state and there should be special emphasis on this sector. The government had decreased budgetary outlay for agriculture this year, which is not good. If we don't care about our food providers, we will die of starvation,"" said social worker Alok Mohanty. ""The government should not be so insensitive to the farmers' cause. Bagarti had taken loan from the co-operative bank. He was shaken following the crop loss. Now, the government is trying to paint it otherwise,"" said BJP MLA Pradip Purohit."

NDDB chairman Dilip Rath told the media this evening that the unit was being set up by Mother Dairy Fruits and Vegetables, a wholly owned subsidiary of NDDB, at an expenditure of Rs 82.77 crore. ""It is being set up in two phases. The first phase comprising an IQF (individual quick freezers) freezing line with an annual capacity of 5,650 tonne will be commissioned tomorrow,"" he said. Products of this facility will be marketed under Safal, the brand used by Mother Dairy. Mother Dairy managing director S. Nagarajan, who was also present at the briefing, said civil construction of the second phase comprising a pulp processing unit of 17,700 tonne capacity was also nearly complete. It would be commissioned by the end of the year. In the first phase, freezing of vegetables, particularly green peas, would be taken up, while in the second phase, processing of tomatoes would be done. ""But quality of tomatoes available locally is not of processing variety. Hence, its quality needs to be upgraded,"" Nagarajan said, adding they had already engaged their procurement team for motivating farmers to use high quality seeds for getting the desired yield. ""The turnover of the facility in its full capacity is pegged at Rs 150 crore with around 45 per cent likely to be transferred to farmers,"" NDDB chairman Rath said, adding that the unit would also spur massive direct and indirect employment in ancillary services like supply chain, logistics and transportation. NDDB got the clearance from the state government in December 2015 for setting up the fruit and vegetable processing plant on a plot measuring about 27 acres in Nagri. Besides retail sale of vegetables, it also plans to prepare sauce and pulp concentrates using fruits such as banana, guava, mango, papaya and litchi. Jharkhand is among the six largest green peas and tomato producing states. NDDB chose Jharkhand for its ecology, considered ideal for horticulture landscaping. Besides, the use of pesticides is also less in Jharkhand compared to other states north India."

Sarma made the statement in the Assembly after BJP legislator Ganesh Kumar Limbu drew the minister's attention to an increasing number of cancer cases in the state. Cancer cases in the state rose from 24,846 in 2011, to 25,119 in 2012, 25,391 in 2013 and 25,663 in 2014. The minister said an excessive use of pesticides and chemical fertilisers by farmers is taking a toll on the people's health and causing diseases like cancer. Scientific studies have proven this. Sarma proposed the formation of an inter-departmental committee of the health and agriculture departments to address this problem. ""As Assam imports many food items from other states, we require a national policy to regulate the use of fertilisers and pesticides. We will bring it to the notice of the Union health ministry,"" he said. Harmful chemical fertilisers and pesticides are being used to grow crops and artificial ripening agents such as calcium carbide are being used to ripen fruits like mangoes and bananas. Artificial colours are being used in fruits such as watermelon, papaya, pomegranates and vegetables such as capsicum, carrots, tomatoes and so on. These chemicals are said to be carcinogenic and also interfere with the digestive system, causing peptic ulcers. BJP legislator Pranab Kalita today raised the issue of the alleged use of formalin, a toxic and carcinogenic chemical commonly used to preserve bodies in mortuaries, to prevent fish from decomposing during transportation. ""It is a major cause of concern for us as Assam imports a large quantity of fish from other states. Moreover, some other harmful chemicals are also reportedly being used to grow more and bigger fish,"" said Kalita. He sought an inquiry into this matter and fisheries minister Parimal Suklabaidya agreed. Suklabaidya said Assam imported 14,825 metric tonnes (MT) fish during 2015-16. He said the figure was 12,830MT in 2013-14 and 12,531MT in 2014-15. He said Assam imports fish mostly from Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. He said a restriction has been imposed on fishing during the breeding season, which is from April 1 to July 15, to increase the number of indigenous fish species in waterbodies and rivers of the state. ""In the budget, the establishment of a live gene bank has been proposed in coordination with State College of Fisheries at Raha for the conservation of local species of fish,"" the minister said."

Set up by Mother Dairy Fruits and Vegetables, a wholly-owned NDDB subsidiary, at a cost of Rs 82.77 crore, the plant has come up on a 27-acre plot 40km from the capital. Processed products would be sold under the well-known Mother Dairy brand Safal. Union minister of state for agriculture and Lohardaga MP Sudarshan Bhagat, state agriculture minister Randhir Kumar Singh, NDDB chairman Dilip Rath, chief secretary Rajbala Verma and Nagri farmers were also present. In his address, the chief minister said this plant was in line with their mission to make Jharkhand self-sufficient in the agro sector. In the coming days more such units would be set up. ""This plant won't just directly procure fruits and vegetables locally to process them and sell within and outside the state, but will also generate lots of employment,"" he said to a crowd of around 500. ""Around 70 per cent of total jobs generated by the plant will get jobs immediately when the first phase of the plant starts now. When the second phase is ready for launch and operations by this year-end, more jobs will get created,"" he added but did not specify how many direct and indirect jobs would be generated. Asked for an idea of the kind of numbers they were looking at, B.S. Khanna, managing director of Jharkhand Milk Federation, which NDDB runs, said they estimated ""500 direct jobs"" when the plant operates fully, while indirect jobs would be ""at least double"". Set up in two phases, the first phase of the plant comprises an IQF (individual quick freezer) with an annual capacity of 5,650 tonne which will start immediately while the second will have a pulp processing unit of 17,700 tonne annual capacity, civil works for which are also underway. In the first phase, freezing of vegetables, particularly green peas, would be the focus. The second phase would be geared mainly around tomato processing. The total annual turnover of the plant in its full capacity is pegged at Rs 150 crore with around 45 per cent likely to be transferred to farmers,said state agriculture department officials. The chief minister maintained that the government was working out plans to make farmers adapt progressive and organic farming. ""We have signed a few MoUs for skill-building centres in agriculture sector during the Global Investors' Summit which will soon see the light of day,"" he said. Advising farmers to take up flower cultivation, Das said if the floriculture sector started blooming, the government would start planning units to convert flowers into various end products. ""We earmarked Rs 700 crore in 2017-18 budget only for skill mission and there is lot of potential in agriculture and animal husbandry,"" he said.

58f50a057be9e018510a210a,Making electric sense,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170108/jsp/opinion/story_129076.jsp,2017-01-08,,Telegraph,"When young students first start to study art history they often make the elementary mistake of putting different movements and artists into quite rigid chronologies, forgetting that people and events in history - like colour on a canvas - often bleed and dribble into each other. For a long time there was a certain accepted progression that mid-20th-century Western art followed: before the Second World War there were the Europeans who were important, Picasso, Matisse, Klee and the Surrealists, followed by the shift of power from Paris to New York, when Abstract Expressionism was arrived at and the great Abs Ex painters exploded across the art firmament; then, counter to the Abs Ex gang came the Pop Art wallas, Rauschenberg, Johns, Warhol, followed by a whole host of others, themselves followed by the various art movements of the 1960s and then the 1970s and so on, forming a neat and orderly graph. Convenient as this was, to put on a timeline in a book, reality was somewhat different. Kandinsky and Rodchenko, and then Klee, and then the Bauhaus crew, and the soon overlapping Georgia O'Keeffe had all pushed the envelope of non-representational painting well before the 1940s. Marcel Duchamp and the Dadaists had already challenged the gallery-oriented, market-oriented narrative of the 'maestro' and 'masterpiece' with great verve and humour, Man Ray had exploded (among many other things) the fetish of the 'painterly hand', well before Pop Art spilled out from a quickly cut open can of Campbell's tomato soup. Abs Ex may have gained traction only after WW2, but people such as Arshile Gorky and Josef Albers were already pushing the next generation of young painters into jettisoning cubist distortions of actual organic and inorganic forms and going for 'pure' abstraction, for undiluted mark-making. Even as the New York art establishment began to recognize and champion Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Willem De Kooning and others, already an only slightly younger generation was starting to tug at the carpet under the feet of the Abs Ex painters. By the early 1950s, Rauschenberg was hanging out with composer John Cage and his partner, choreographer Merce Cunningham, at Black Mountain College in North Dakota and opening up his mind in ways that were very different from what the Abs Ex people were thinking. By the mid-1950s, several different pots of artwork, some of them highly 'experimental', were bubbling in different dilapidated kitchens across America and a western Europe still licking its wounds from the ravages of the war. While the Abs Ex painters were in full flow, so were the duo of Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, later joined by Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, James Rosenquist and Claes Oldenburg, all of whom loosely formed what is labelled American Pop Art. In West Germany, Joseph Beuys and associated artists had already begun to change the game with the first Documenta show at Kassel. People who would do huge public works such as Christo, massive earthworks in landscape like Robert Smithson, and the single parent of video art, Nam June Paik, were all about to start their dialogue with the (then largely Western) public. I could have seen the big Abstract Expressionist retrospective at the Royal Academy at several points over last autumn but, as luck would have it, I managed to make it on one of the last days of the show, with a trip to Tate Modern to catch the newly opened retrospective of Robert Rauschenberg just a few days later. To be able to immediately compare and contrast these two connected but opposed bodies of work was a piece of great good fortune. The show at the RA repeatedly reminds us that it is the first big UK retro of the Abs Ex painters since 1959. This fact is startling and it leads to a bifurcating conclusion, one that eats its own tail, so to speak. On the one hand, it speaks of ubiquitousness of Abs Ex as the canonical narrative of post-war art internationally, the grand scale, the primacy of colour, the heroic (usually male) painter making these feverish or highly meditative marks, leaving layered pigment spoors of his body on the canvas, this 'model' that has been the most copied by artists outside the Western world over the last 60-odd years; in other words, who needs to see another Pollock, Rothko or De Kooning when they are so present everywhere and when there are so many sub-abstractionists about? On the other hand, it also speaks of the insularity of the UK art establishment, an insularity that (till the early 90s at least) is not uncoupled with an inferiority complex vis--vis the brash, loud, indefatigably inventive art cousins from across the pond; that is, why should we big up this dated form of picture-making when we have so many great artists of our own, doing everything from modern figurative to abstraction to Pop to dodgy suspended sharks and soiled beds? Whatever the logic for the 57-year-long ignore, the RA show makes some amends with its size and spread. It's a great pleasure to be confronting Pollock's manic splatter, entire canvases, rectangular islands encrusted as if by deliberate coloured bird-droppings from very intelligent avian beings, to be immersed in the chroma- dhrupad of Rothko, to let the eyes be led a dance again by the starkly beautiful black and white slashes and whorls of Franz Kline and Robert Motherwell. The curators of the show make the case that these painters were painting at a time of great anxiety for the human race, when the Cold War and the various mid-century upheavals held us hostage from many different directions, and that a great humanist vision actually comes through the most controlled Ad Reinhardt as it does in the craziest Willem De Kooning. I love this work, but I'm far from sure about this argument. Whatever its beginnings, after a while Abs Ex provided yet another closed club, yet another notional, canonical top table, with all the suspect money and power of the millionaire collectors attached. Sure, most of the brilliant painters in this show retain a sense of play, and of great meditative gravitas, but ultimately they could not stop Abstract Expressionism from becoming what it did - a fetishistic commodity art divorced from the reality around it. For the connection to the real, to the immediate, to the thorny, barbed wired daily experience of mid-20th century America, for the belly laughs and a very different meditation you have to go to Robert Rauschenberg. The eye, the sheer joy and intelligence of this man, one of the greatest artists (and not just of the 20th century), is hard even to outline in the space available here. But let me just recount one thing that struck me when I first discovered Rauschenberg as a young art student in late 1970s America, that of all these mostly white and mostly male painters who made up the American Art All-stars of the 50s, 60s, 70s and the 80s, RR was the one who seemed to have internalized the chaos and craziness of street Calcutta without ever having been there. The trousers stuck to the canvas and painted over, the goat with a tyre around its middle, the combine painting Bed, splattered with paint and gestures brazenly hijacked from the Abs Ex guys yet taken to another level with the iconic pillow and the quilt, the controlled pictorial noise of the big silk screen 'collages' all, still, make electric sense in today's world, and light up connections across widely different cultures. There is the poetry of chance married to rigorous looking, great hedonism of material leavened by monkish self-denial of any self-indulgence. Looking at contemporary art, Indian or otherwise, I'm often struck by what I call 'strategic visual amnesia'. The works presented often make no acknowledgment of their debt to what has gone before: it's as if people like Claes Oldenburg or Cindy Sherman - to mention just two artists - had never existed, never produced any work. Looking at Rauscehnberg's huge range, from the all black canvases of the early 1950s to the gossamer constructions of the Hoarfrost series, the spiky combines, the hypnotic silk screen blow-ups, the performance and video art, the textile based work made in Ahmedabad in the mid-1970s, you realize here is someone who is at once so open and generous about the debts he owes his predecessors and yet such is his discipline and inventiveness that so many people who've followed him will have no choice but to acknowledge how much he opened their eyes, hearts and minds. As I leave the Rauschenberg show, I get word on my mobile that John Berger has died at the age of 90. A friend who loves Berger's writing sends me this line which makes so much sense in the context of both the shows I have just seen: ""The function of the work of art,"" Berger sums up (Max) Raphael, ""is to lead us from the work to the process of creation which it contains."""

Several tropes from the Vijay films are replicated here  the precocious childhood, the early initiation into the world of crime, the abiding influence of the Mother figure, the bonding within the community of crooks, the loyalty for the mentor and the eventual breaking away and establishment of ones own power centre. And, of course, the wordplay in dialogue after dialogue. My favourite is the mother saying that she doesnt want to give her son to acquire udhar ka nazariya (borrowed point of view) but to have his own chaukas nazar (a sharp insight).Yet theres more to the film. If Vijay addressed the angst of the day and the prevalent cynicism against the system, Raees, though lot less intense and brooding and more brassy and overstated, is also rooted in a specific point in time and a place.

Wholesale traders noted that the market received only 220 truckloads of vegetables against its daily share of 300 lorries on Monday. This had led to short supply of vegetables such as carrot, brinjal, beans and beetroot.Lorries mainly from southern parts of the State refrained from transporting goods even though the Tamil Nadu State Lorry Owners Federation had announced that essential goods supply would not be affected. Dry weather and drought conditions in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka were also cited to be another reason for the steady increase in the cost of some vegetables.P.Sukumar, joint secretary, Koyambedu Fruits, Flowers and Vegetables Market, said on Monday, some vegetables, including cabbage, carrot, beans and broad beans were costlier by 25% than last week due to short supply. Vegetables such as brinjal and carrot were priced between Rs. 30-Rs. 40 a kg. The prices doubled in the initial two days of the strike as residents bought more to stock owing to strike. However, prices of onion, tomato and potato remain stable. They are sold at less than Rs. 25 a kg in wholesale market as most of the stock is procured from Maharashtra and other parts of north India. Meanwhile, about 200 traders participated in a demonstration in support of the farmers demands for loan waiver and drought relief fund."

There too, the Kutch Asmita Manch members waved black flags when the rally was passing through the town. They also shouted slogans against the Congress party However, because of heavy police deployment, altercation between the two groups was avoided.When the rally reached Bhuj, Vaghela held a press conference where he alleged that BJP wants to transform Kutch into Bangkok. ""They (BJP) want to convert Kutch into a sex hub,"" he added.During the press conference, one woman member of Mandvi taluka panchayat, who is a member of the BJP, alleged that she was raped and mentally tortured by BJP leaders. ""When I lodged rape complaint, many of the top leaders tortured me mentally and asked me to withdraw my complaint,"" said the woman who had come with her face covered. ""I have come to this Congress programme to seek justice for myself,"" she added.Later, when the rally reached Gandhidham in the evening, members of the Kutch Asmita Manch shouted slogans against the Congress party and some even threw tomatoes on the rally. This agitated the Congress members who entered into a fist fight with the Kutch Asmita Manch members. However, police quickly swung into action and separated both the groups."

Those conquistadors  the Spanish and the Portuguese  sailing in on their schooners, clippers and frigates, touched down in India and brought with them these fruits of labour from the New World. With the infusion of these vegetables  especially the chilli  Indian cooking techniques were never the same again.While that's history for you, here is a lesson in statistics. India produces the highest quantity of chillies in the world. We are also the world's biggest exporter and consumer of the product. Over one-third of the country's chilli is produced in one region  the Andhra Pradesh-Telangana belt, which also gives us one of our most prized peppers, the diabolically hot Guntur chilli.From Kashmir to Kanyakumari, Nagaland to Rajasthan , our soil produces some of the world's most bewildering variety of chillies. Take the examples of the Kashmiri mirch (flavourful yet zingy) or the byadagi from Karnataka (pungent and eye-watering). And then there are those northeast bombshells  the dalle from Sikkim and the dhani lanka from Meghalaya, Tripura and Bengal.And finally, above all else, is the bhoot jolokia. Cultivated across the northeast, especially in Assam , Nagaland and Manipur, it is also called naga mirch, u-morok and ominously, the ghost chilli. Consistently proven to be one of the hottest peppers in the world, it was at one time being considered for use in tear gas shells. A bite of the bhoot jolokia can numb your mind and transport you into an otherworldly zone of intensely painful euphoria. It's not for the faint-hearted. All of this is to point out that whether the chilli came from Mexico or wherever else, nowhere is it as celebrated as in India. From curries and pastes, to pickles and salads, there's some mirchi in almost everything we eat. Chillies are a rich source of Vitamin C and are loaded with antioxidants that help fight cancer. They act as digestives and have no calories. It's time we stopped being apologetic about our hot and pungent food and embraced its fiery goodness. After all, what's life without a little mirchi?This is amma's special recipe from the kitchens of Andhra and its not for the faint-hearted. Andhra cuisine is famous for its spicy dishes and mamsam guntu, as the name suggests, uses the eye-watering Guntur chilli in liberal doses. Made with chicken or mutton, this delicacy really rubs it in with a pungent mix of chillies and ground condiments and also a generous helping of green chillies to top up the heat. As you bite into the succulent pieces of meat, be sure you'll shed tears. Whether these are of joy or regret depends on your capacity to weather hot food. You can try this dish with steamed rice and a dollop of ghee. Trust us, it will be an unforgettable experience.Taco is a traditional Mexican dish composed of a corn or wheat tortilla folded or rolled around a filling. This chicken tinga taco's filling has shredded chicken, slow roasted tomato salsa and chipotle chillies. These blazing hot chillies turn the predictable tacos into loaded, sizzling time bombs. Chipotle chillies are imported from Mexico. Since they come as dry chillies, they are first reconstituted to make a sauce, which is used in this spicy taco.Here's something for the vegetarians. This starter is a Vietnamese speciality of potatoes tossed with herbs and hot Sriracha chilli sauce. Sriracha chillies come from the coastal city of Si Racha, in Chonburi Province of eastern Thailand . The beauty of this dish is that the hotness of the chilliesexplode in your mouth before dissolving in a haze of piquancy.This is a Spanish prawn dish cooked in a spicy peri peri sauce made from fiery red and ripe bird's eye chillies. The prawns are fried in olive oil with garlic and cloves and then cooked in the spicy sauce. It is served with Spanish seafood paella rice sauted withsaffron to balance the hotness of the prawns.This oh-so-hot starter is prepared with lantern chillies, ginger and green onion. These chillies come from China and are used for not just its flavour but also for the special heat they add to the dish. The chillies are revered for their intense pungency and take the typical chilli chicken to a zone of untasted white-hot flavours.One of the staple dishes of Kerala, mutton pepper dry has boti pieces of mutton roasted with crushed Malabar pepper and Kerala spices. The tadka also consists of dhani chilli powder, which adds to the spicy taste of the dish. The dhani or bird's eye chilli is tiny but packs a punch in terms of spiciness. It is used not only for cooking but also in chutneys and pickles.It will set fire to your taste buds, but is worth a try.

Ema is chilli and datshi means cheese. It is made from different types of hot chillies (green, red or white) and cheese (datshi, the local Bhutanese cheese). This hot stew of chillies and cheese is unique and can be had as a soup or a dip. The melted cheese and the punch of chillies leave a beautifulaftertaste. It is a big hit with youngsters and vegetarians who throng this restaurant. A word of caution: if you are not used to hot spices, you might want to have a fire extinguisher handy, or some other form of quick relief, when you try this out. Also, The Blue Poppy's momos are as famous as its momo sauce. The extremely spicy momo sauce has a pinch of dalle chilli (from Sikkim) paste  one of the hottest chillies of the northeast known for its sting and flavour.Laal maas, which literally means red meat, is a traditional Rajasthani dish that combines royalty with hotness. Succulent pieces of lamb are cooked only with roasted dry red chillies (locally called tikha laal), pounded in desi ghee and fragrant whole spice mixture or khada masala. It isprepared in a huge handi by simmering for hours together, letting the spices penetrate the chunks of meat and allowing them to be perfectly cooked. It is indeed not for the faint-gutted! The Rajputs used to have this with makkai ki roti, but you could even try it with roomali rotis or jeera rice.This is a Spanish prawn dish cooked in a spicy peri peri sauce made from fiery red and ripe bird's eye chillies. The prawns are fried in olive oil with garlic and cloves and then cooked in the spicy sauce. It is served with Spanish seafood paella rice sauted with saffron to balance the hotness of the prawns."

However, in retail markets all vegetables are sold in the range of Rs 10-Rs 20 per kg,"" he maintained.Sethi said farmers' worst period started during demonetization when there was no cash flow in the market and they were forced to sell their produce at any price. ""Hoping to get the best price as had happened in the past year, farmers had brought a large portion of their fields under vegetable cultivation and also got bumper crop, but demonetization played the spoilsport. Now, with the glut of crops, the only hope now is to export vegetables to Pakistan, which is struggling with their supply,"" said president of association Ravinder Singh.Jamhuri Kisan Sabha president Satnam Singh Ajnala blamed the government for not fixing MSP for vegetables and its inability to set up vegetable-based agro industries in Punjab. ""Since there is no MSP, farmers are being exploited by commission agents and the government is not doing anything,"" he said, adding that the MSP of vegetables would at least ensure that farmers wouldn't be at loss. Besides, he opined that the government should have a dependable transportation network to immediately supply vegetables where there was a deficit."

But farmers now face a new challenge: washed-out roads that will make it difficult to get their crops to market.As harvesting time for tobacco, maize and other crops approaches, fears abound that roads made impassable by rain will not be repaired in time.Some farmers, particularly those growing fruit, already find themselves stuck with produce ready for market but no way to get it there.""There are no roads. They were washed away by the heavy rains,"" said Liberty Kuhudzai, a farmer in Chipendeke, about 70 kilometres south of the city of Mutare.""We have potatoes which are ready for the market but we can't take them. And soon, the maize and other crops will be ready for the market too,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.Chipendeke is one of the most vibrant small-scale farming areas in the province, in far eastern Zimbabwe. Farmers at the moment have potatoes, groundnuts, maize and various vegetables in the ground; in winter they grow wheat, beans, tomatoes and other vegetables.But their main market is in the city of Mutare, and their farming area is connected to the main Mutare-Masvingo highway by a gravel road that snakes along the treacherous edges of the Chitora River.Near Chipendeke Primary School, sections of the road are missing after heavy rain. In other areas, bridges are broken or what remains of the roads are muddy and slippery.""We have tried to repair the roads using our own resources but as soon as we finish the heavy rains come again and wash everything away,"" Kuhudzai said. ""We don't even know what to do. Without the road we are stuck.""LOSING 'A LOT OF MONEY'Catherine Nyakunuhwa, a banana farmer in Honde Valley, said the poor state of the roads meant some of her harvest was lost, affecting her business.""It's now taking too long for us to reach the market with our bananas and we are losing a lot of money. Right now most of my bananas could not reach the market because they rot before they were ferried,"" Nyakunuhwa said.""We are now appealing to the government to help us repair the roads,"" she said, as she sifted through a big basket of rotten bananas to see if any good ones remained. ""Farming is our only source of livelihood and we need good roads to take our crops to the market.""Nyakunuhwa said some farmers have lost more than $100 worth of bananas in a day - a lot of money by local standards.""It's a big loss,"" she said.Zimbabwe's Meteorological Services Department in late February said Manicaland was one the province that has received the heaviest rains - ""in some cases record-breaking rainfall,"" the agency noted.The situation has been made worse by Tropical Cyclone Dineo which hit some parts of the country at the end of February.EFFORTS TO REBUILDTransport and Infrastructural Development Minister Joram Gumbo said his ministry was working with the Ministry of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing to rehabilitate bad or dangerous roads in both urban and rural areas throughout the country.Responding to a question from Francis Mukwangwariwa, a member of parliament from Zvimba East constituency, Gumbo said on live television from Parliament earlier this month that the government needed $100 million to rebuild bridges and the road networks.Mukwangwariwa wanted to know the measures the government had put in place to repair roads and bridges washed away by heavy rain.""We are now in the tobacco selling season and people need to take their tobacco to the tobacco auction floors,"" Mukwangwariwa said.Gumbo said the Ministry of Finance had set aside $15 million to rebuild roads and was trying to acquire about $50 million in loans through the Zimbabwe National Road Authority.""This was done considering that farm produce will need to be taken to the market,"" he told Parliament.Gumbo later told journalists in Harare that major bridges had been affected by the heavy rains in a variety of provinces. In some of the areas, farmers and other residents have been using makeshift bridges to cross flooded rivers.Kuhudzai, the farmer from Chipendeke, however, said he was not convinced that the government would move fast enough to make repairs.""Do you think the government will start with our road?"" Kuhudzai asked. ""We pray so because we don't even know what to do.""

But supplies are falling even from this centuries-old Arabian sea route that is one of the last lifelines to a country on the brink of famine.A two-year-old civil war has severely restricted the flow of food into the main Yemeni cargo ports of Hodeidah and Salif on the Red Sea, where all the large grain silos are located.The small wooden boats sailing from souks in the UAE are moving small but vital supplies by making for the smaller ports to the south coast that are of little use to larger vessels - and often sidestepping military inspections that choke traffic by dropping anchor at secluded coves nearby.The deals originate in the sprawling Al Ras Market, a collection of dusty alleyways near the Dubai Creek where an array of food and spices are on display including colourful sacks of Pakistani and Indian rice.The dhows - plying the ancient trade route that once carried the likes of pearls, frankincense and myrrh - supply 14,000 to 18,000 tonnes of foodstuffs a month to Yemen, according to traders. That represents a drop of about 30-40 percent over the past year because of problems with payment, as well as adverse sailing conditions.""The Yemeni currency is destroyed, sometimes we can't get paid enough. We can only go once a month because the seas are too rough,"" said trader Mohammed Hassan, at a docking station at nearby Port Khaled in Sharjah""Sometimes we have to wait 40 days.""The volumes of food carried on this route represent a small fraction of the supply to Yemen, which relies on imports for 90 percent of its food. But it has become increasingly important as fighting has raged, the economy has collapsed and Yemen has needed all the help it can get.PORT DAMAGEThousands of people have been killed in the civil war pits the Iran-allied Houthi group against a Saudi-backed coalition - which includes the UAE - fighting to restore the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.The conflict has choked imports. Sixty percent of Yemenis, or 17 million people, are in ""crisis"" or ""emergency"" food situations, according to the United Nations.While vessels seeking access to Houthi-held areas must face inspections for smuggled weapons, the government-controlled south has less restrictions.Food imports into Hodeidah have fallen relentlessly, with only a few ships arriving each week - compared with dozens before the war - and more shipping lines pulling out due to the growing risks, according to aid and shipping sources.In recent weeks damage to infrastructure in the neighbouring port of Salif has also cut food deliveries, aid officials said.""The country is living on its reserves,"" said Robert Mardini, International Committee of the Red Cross regional director for the Near and Middle East in Geneva this week.""There is a lack of liquidity, no payment of salaries, which means that the spending power has collapsed and that the price of food is soaring whenever it is available.""'PAY THUGS'UAE-based dhow captains avoid these snarl-ups by steering clear of the big Red Sea ports and instead ply their trade to the south, often docking at informal inlets.The average journey takes about five to eight days, with the boats capable of taking up to 2,000 tonnes of goods, still small fry compared with cargo ships that could provide more relief to one of the poorest and most unstable countries in the world.Trader Ali Mahdani ships his goods out of Dubai to the southern Yemeni ports of Aden, Mukalla or Mokha, goods worth 4-6 million UAE dirhams ($1.1-1.6 million) per month, around 2,000 tonnes of mostly rice, spices or cooking oil. To avoid payments in the battered Yemeni currency he gets paid in Saudi riyals.There are few issues upon arrival. That's a sharp contrast the scrutiny that any vessels hoping to access the north would be subjected to as the Saudi-led coalition search for weapons which may be headed into Houthi hands.""You may have to pay thugs every once in a while but otherwise it is all good to go,"" said Mahdani, dressed in a flowing white robe.Trader Amin Baghersh ships powered milk, tomato paste, sugar and rice from Al Ras to Yemen, selling about one million UAE dirhams worth per month.He and others rely on hawala, an informal trading system through exchange houses based on trust and personal ties.Most of his goods make their way to Mukalla and Aden and surrounding areas. But he, like others, has taken a heavy hit from the Yemeni currency crisis and payment problems caused by the war.An Iranian trader had similar complaints.""I used to transfer about 2,000 tonnes of food a month,"" said the trader, who declined to give his name. ""In the last three or four months people asked me for supplies but I am reluctant to deal with them.""($1 = 3.6724 UAE dirham)(Additional reporting by Jonathan Saul in London and Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva; Editing by Pravin Char)"

Celebrated since 3,000 years, the festival occurs on the first day of the first month of the Fasli calender. For Mumbai's minuscule peace loving Zoroastrian community comprising 50,000 odd Parsis and Iranis, Navroze is celebrated with a lot of fervour.The numerous Parsi baugs dotted along the city come alive with the cheerful greetings of 'Navroze Mubarak' after which the faithful make a trip to the neighbourhood agiary or atash behram  most of them in south Mumbai  to pray and offer sandalwood to the holy fire that burns inside. The agiaries have been scrupulously cleaned in the days leading to Navroze and decorated with beautiful divas and fresh flowers. Some Zoroastrians have jasans  thanksgiving prayers performed by priests  at home while some make a trip to the Iranshah at Udwada  the holiest place of worship for Zoroastrians.Houses are spruced up, the most expensive China and fancy linen is brought out, colourful intricate rangoli is made at the entrance and colourful bead and glass torans are hung across thresholds. According to ancient customs, the Iranis lay down a special table, where the Khordeh Avesta (holy book) is placed along with a lamp or candle, sprouted wheat or beans, a bowl with a silver coin, flowers, sweets, rosewater, mirror and bowl of water. Seven food items beginning with 'sh' in Persian  wine, sugar, milk, sweet meat, honey, sweets and syrup  are placed along with fruits, dried fruits and nuts. Signifying prosperity, wealth and happiness among other things, the table is considered an auspicious part of celebrations.The highlight of the day, of course, is the food  no Parsi occasion is complete without a scrumptious meal. The day begins with the tempting aroma of frying vermicelli or sev in ghee with sugar, almonds, raisins and charoli. Some homes make the rava, which is white and has almonds and raisins on top. Breakfast also comprises the Parsi poro, an omelette of tomatoes, green chillies, onions, kothmir or the akuri, which is scrambled. Lunch could be Sali Boti, Dhan Dal Patia or Mutton Dhansak. Dessert is jalebi, sutarfeni, falooda or kulfi.After the indispensable afternoon siesta, it is time to host a get-together at home, meet old friends at the Parsi Gymkhana or spend the evening watching a play or the latest movie, followed by dinner at a fancy restaurant. While the naataks are nowhere as popular as they used to be during the time of the late Adi Marzban , known for his outrageous Gujarati plays, there are still plenty of other choices. Navroze Mubarak to all!"

While Msquared of Technopark now has a plot filled with various fruit trees and vegetables, UST Global of Infopark and Prakruti group of Trivandrum have been into in-campus vegetable farming for the past few months. Kochi Times takes a walk down these IT campusesThe employees of UST Global, Kochi, took up farming on campus as a means to break out of the home-work-home rut. Dipin Varghese, who coordinates the farming activities in the company, says, ""In order to engage in something else other than just work, we had started an online offshoot of the Ernakulam Public Library in our office eight months ago. The library also had a krishi club. Inspired by the same, one of our farming enthusiast employees, Srinath, asked why can't we too start a vegetable garden in our campus.""Many other employees were also interested in the same and the techies decided to try their hand at cultivation. They earmarked about 20 cents of land in a plot near their office. ""We grew only peas and ladies finger at this phase and hardly knew anything about farming, but produced veggies costing nearly `12,000! We sold it off in the campus around the time of Onam and also took a handful, home! That was a huge motivation to continue with it,"" says Akash Viswom, another techie-farmer.Similarly, the employees of Msquared in Technopark, Trivandrum, started farming after seeing the success of farming on a land near their Ranni office. ""Inspired by the same, we decided to devote a little time and identified about 30 cents for cultivation on our Trivandrum campus,"" says Jinu Jose, CEO of the company, pointing at the farm which is now full of fruit trees.Prakruti, a group of green enthusiasts in Technopark, has also been into in-campus cultivation on 15 cents of land for the past two months. ""We tried farming on a land near to the campus first, and the success motivated us. Our farm has veggies like bottle gourd, bitter gourd, brinjal and more growing well, now,"" says Biju Sundaran of the group.All of these techies spend a major chunk of their time in their workplace, but that doesn't stop them from taking out some time to take care of their garden. Biju says, ""We take turns to water and weed the saplings in the mornings and evenings, and also during the break time. Sometimes, we also drop in during weekends to tend to the plants.""As for the UST Global folks, they had to turn the rocky terrain into fertile land, all by themselves! Lekha Chandran from the company says, ""That did not deter our spirit. From a plot of land nearby, we gathered enough of soil and levelled the area, all by ourselves. We also filled growbags with soil and cow dung on our own and planted some saplings. This time, we graduated to five vegetables - peas, tomato, ladies finger, broad beans, green chili and brinjal. And what's more, many of us also started cultivation at our homes, alongside!"" The saplings have just started growing and the joy of watching it is something else and also a stress buster, say these techies.These techies ensure that they use only organic manure in their farms. Dipin of UST says, ""We have bought cow dung from local farmers and as the next step, we are trying to set up a waste water treatment facility using water from our cafeterias."" The cultivators of Prakruti are also preparing pesticides on their own, mixing green leaves and cow dung. The techies also take training from various governments agricultural services, to sharpen their farming skills."

The NRDC said on Tuesday it was evaluating the next steps in its legal fight.Government scientists said the delay, part of a standard review, was not expected to affect the insect's conservation, Interior Department spokeswoman Heather Swift said in a statement on Tuesday.The agency ""will work with stakeholders to ensure collaborative conservation among landowners, farmers, industry, and developers in the areas where the species is native,"" she added.Bumble bees pollinate wildflowers and about a third of U.S. crops, according to the Xerces Society. A recent study by the Center for Biological Diversity found that more than 700 of the 4,000 bee species native to North America and Hawaii may be inching toward extinction.

Styled much like a British gentlemans club, it is situated on the ground level at Peninsula Redpine Hotel in the busy neighbourhood of Marol, which straddles the commercial with the residential.Its pretty much mandatory to go thirsty to a cocktail tasting, especially one that requires you to stir, shake, and get down to the dirty. We are at The Stables to attend a masterclass conducted by the bars mixologists. The bar/pub is is all done up in dark wood, and antique style with eye-catching chandeliers. Photographs of famous horses like The Secretariat dot the walls along with trivia, some examples of which are: Did you know the Seattle Slew had a habit of tiptoeing before a race, a move that came to be known as the war dance, and The Secretariat had a heart, two-and-a-half-times the size of a normal horse.Mixologist James Birch, who has come from the bars Dubai outpost, begins the workshop with two cocktails. The first one is Wind Suck (Rs. 400), a vodka-based drink, with fresh cucumber, lemon juice, honey, orange juice and lemonade. It is cool, refreshing and has a prominent kick (pun-intended). Wind Suck is so named as it is what the horse does when it is happy. It sucks in wind, he says, taking another empty glass to stir Stables Grog (Rs. 300), a drink named after Franky, a famous jockey. He is an ex-Godolphine club member, one of the biggest derby clubs in the world, owned by the Sheikh of Dubai. He once requested for a rum-based drink, which he grogged in under two minutes! exclaims Birch.Play on the palateNext up is mixologist Stephan Jovanovic who whips up the Oscar sangria named after yet another award-winning derby horse. The bright blue drink has a mash-up of Merlot martini, brandy, gin and orange curaao. While the backstory and ingredients sound promising, we dont like the drink for its jumbled mess it creates on our palate, its just too dry and sour. We pay keener attention to the last drink, Cribber Ascot (Rs. 450) made with white rum, dark rum, orange curaao, orange juice, lemon juice, grenadine syrup  all of which has a smoother play on the palate.Experts Birch and Jovanovic are done showing us their skills and it is time for us to try our hand at making Stables Grog. It isnt easy as it looks  we throw in Jamaican rums, pineapple juice, lemon juice, passion syrup and Angostura bitters, topping up the mixing glass with crushed ice and give it a good shake.But shaking cocktails is hard work and we discover that we need some sustenance, which comes in the form of the perennially busy popcorn machine; Loaded Nachos (Rs. 300), guacamole, sour cream, beans and cheese, and crisp potato skins (Rs. 300) topped with cheesy. The Portobello Mushroom Burger (Rs. 325) has marinated button mushrooms and tangy tomatoes sans a patty with freshly baked bun. Highway 55 (Rs. 400) is a wholesome, cheesy baguette sandwich with pork loin, with onions and mushrooms. The BBQ chicken pizza (Rs. 450) has juicy strips of grilled chicken and sweetened red onions.Since we are not indulging in a full menu tasting, and are concentrating on the drinks, we must mention the Smooth Mouth (Rs. 700), which looks like a cold coffee. We are not fans of milk-based drinks, solely because a shoddy rendition can ruin the night. We eye this one with contempt, though one sip and we claim it a stunner: its loaded with vodka, Amaretto, Baileys, Kahlua, brandy, orange curaao, milk and fresh cream. The comfort of Amaretto, the citrus punch from orange and the creamy Bailey makes it a comforting drink likely to get repeat orders. Dessert is a wholesome brownie (Rs. 399), drizzled with a thick, caramelised toffee sauce, with a vanilla scoop melting alongside its warm companions.The Stables, Peninsula Redpine Hotel, Andheri East; 40912345"

Here, you will find visitors slipping token into vending machines to collect boxes of their 'pret-a-prasadam', prepared with precision in the automated temple kitchen.K Sri Sridhar, a herbal oncologist who helped set up the temple, says his idea to serve up desserts and sandwiches as part of the temple prasadam has rustled up quite a bit of interest among locals and tourists. ""The idea was to show that anything that is nutritious and prepared in a clean kitchen with a clean mind can be served to God. It doesn't have to be only traditional dishes,"" says Sridhar.A few months ago, the temple even introduced the 'birthday cake prasadam' for its devotees. ""We maintain a computerised register of their birth dates and addresses and door deliver a cake prasadam to them. It's a hit among the elderly devotees, because coming from the temple it adds a special touch to the occasion,"" says Sridhar.On Saturday, for instance, 81-year-old Subbulakshmi was more than pleasantly surprised when she received a cake prasadam. ""It was so pretty with flowers and icing,"" says the 81-year-old, adding it was her first surprise cake ever. ""And it came with an agar deepam (a traditional oil lamp) instead of candles which was so nice. Just like they light at the temple,"" she adds.

In a statement in the assembly, Maharathy said favourable weather conditions had helped tomato production in the district to go up, resulting in a fall in prices. Quoting the wholesale price index, he said nationally the price of vegetables was lower than that of last year.The minister, however, was silent on setting up of infrastructure, particularly cold storages, a factor widely seen responsible for the distress sale of vegetables across the state. Official sources said Keonjhar has only one cold storage facility with a capacity of 5,000 tonne.Maharathy said Keonjhar district collector N Thirumala Naik visited certain tomato growing villages and initiated discussion on setting up of a committee through which farmers could sell vegetables directly to retailers. The minister claimed he has also instructed authorities of the integrated tribal development agency (ITDA) to ensure purchase of tomatoes directly from the growers for residential schools. ""Due to the intervention of the administration, local traders have been buying tomatoes directly from farmers since March 3 at Rs 120 per crate,"" he said.The farmers' wing of the BJP, which organised a massive protest here during the day, was far from impressed with the minister's statement.

In return, I get satisfaction,"" Shobha said.Krishna's rooftop garden spreads across 5,000sqft, which she had reared with equal love and dedication for the past eight years.""Earlier I used to grow flowers like roses, sunflowers and petunia in small pots.

Farmers hurled the tomato harvest to the ground, demanding access to cold storage facilities and compensation for losses.Later, they submitted a memorandum to the additional district magistrate, Sangram Keshari Swain . ""We have received their demand letter and have asked the horticulture department for an inquiry. We will take necessary steps after we get the report,"" said Swain.Farmers alleged that they have been unable to sell their produce and have not been able to store them either, without cold storage facilities. Most of them had taken loans from different banks and SHG groups and have not been able to repay them, as a result. ""While earlier, traders from Sambalpur, Rourkela and Khurdha procured tomatoes to avoid distress sales by farmers, after the intervention of district administration, this year no agencies have done that,"" said farmer, Debabrata Mohanta.While the rate of tomatoes per 30 kilograms is about Rs 30, the plucking wage is about Rs 10 per 30 kilos. ""Hence, we could not engage labour to pluck the tomatoes as there is no market to sale. Tomato on acres of land is gradually rotting,"" Debabrata said.Processing units like Bilati Orissa Limited used to procure the major bulk of tomatoes earlier for production of sauce. Problems started after the closure of the firm.Worst affected are farmers from villages like Mahadeijoda, Tikarpada, Salarapenth, Naupada and Dalimapur, which cater to the district's vegetable market.""If the tomatoes could be stored now then they could be saved and after about one month, we could get their value. But there is no cold storage here to store vegetables and other products,"" said farmer Sarat Mohanta of Mahadeijoda.""We are making an investigation on the quantities of production and the causes of distress sale. Due to favourable climate all over the state, no one has been coming to these villages to buy tomatoes,"" said the Keonjhar deputy director of horticulture, Ranjan Kumar Das Mohapatra . ""Farmers can process the tomatoes by setting up a small scale processing unit with an investment of Rs 2 lakh. We can provide technical support if they need. They can preserve the extract of tomatoes for weeks this way,"" Mohapatra added."

As local harvest of vegetables including tomatoes, chilli, lemon, coriander and bottle gourd is likely to go down, prices are likely to shoot up. Prices of vegetables are all time cheap since January due to extremely good local harvest. However, wholesale traders are expecting scarcity of vegetables as local harvest gets exhausted from March.Presently, homemakers are enjoying vegetable shopping as prices remained cheaper in January and February. Tomatoes in wholesale are priced at Rs 5 to Rs 10 per kg where as it is selling at Rs 10 to Rs 15 per kg in retail market.

Water hyacinth has covered the river on both sides of the weir. Thousands of fish have died in the river and can be seen upon moving the hyacinth. A foul smell persists in the area.Indrayani river flows along the northern boundary of Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits. In 1997, Talawade, Chikhli, Moshi, Charholi and Dudulgaon, located by Indrayani river, along with another 13 villages were merged into the municipal corporation limits.82-year-old farmer Govind Saste , who owns an agricultural plot near the weir in Moshi, said, ""Earlier, the river was so clean that we would drink the water and swim in it but the water started getting polluted about 10 years ago. The crop yield has reduced by 20% due to the polluted water. Tomatoes and brinjals drop from the plants before maturity and cauliflower does not grow to full potential, reducing the yield.""According to farmers in the area, the groundwater in areas up to 1,200 feet from the river has become polluted and borewells have also been affected in Moshi. Another farmer Raju Saste, who lives in the vicinity, said, ""We get drinking water from PCMC but the animals drink the water from the river when they are brought here for grazing. The water makes them ill.""Changdev Kudale, a farmer from the village, pointed out, ""Motors of pumps supplying water to the fields are located in the riverbed. We have suffered from skin rashes after we enter the river to use the pumps,"" he added.Speaking to TOI, assistant commissioner and Zone E officer of PCMC Chandrakant Indalkar said, ""We regularly remove the water hyacinth but it grows back. The health department will invite bids to allot a contract to remove water hyacinth from Indrayani river soon."" The bids could not be invited earlier due to the election code of conduct.A civic health official said, ""The domestic untreated sewage released into the river provides an ideal environment for fast growth of water hyacinth. The chemicals released through untreated industry effluents has caused the death of fish.""Sandeep Alhat, a resident of Laxminagar in Moshi said, ""We stay around half a kilometer from the river but still have to face mosquito menace due to the rampant growth of water hyacinth in the river after the end of rainy season. People who go to switch on or off the motors of water pumps in the riverbed for watering their adjacent fields have to face problems of itching and boils after they come out of the polluted water."""

The rising temperature has been affecting the flowering process of vegetables and has brought the state's production down by 50% this season, said sources from Vegetable Growers Association of India The situation is particularly worrisome in Pune, Nashik, Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur that are known to be major vegetable growing areas.Shriram Gadhave, president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India, told TOI that vegetables that are in the flowering stage have been adversely affected by the recent heatwave and the ongoing temperature conditions in parts of Maharashtra. ""The yield of all vegetables has dipped by 50% due to the current weather conditions. The high heat burns the flowers that are meant to fruit later,"" said Gadhave.He added that leafy greens, beans, tomatoes, cauliflower, pointed gourd and cucumbers, among others, have been affected. Narendra Pawar , who heads a farmer producer company with 2,500 vegetable growers from Pune, Satara and Ahmednagar, said that major vegetable growing districts -Nashik and Pune - have been most-affected. ""Water shortage and increasing temperature prevent the vegetable flowers from fruiting, resulting in a 30% to 40% drop in production and supply into markets across Maharashtra. The heat has not only been turning the leaves of vegetable black but is also hampering the growth of plants,"" he said.According to Gadhave, the high temperature conditions seem to be more conspicuous this year and the major vegetable growing belt in west Maharashtra has been affected the most. ""Though the area cultivating vegetables in Maharashtra is huge, production has not been up to the mark this season due to the sudden spike in mercury during the latter half of March and in April. Marathwada and Vidarbha are also reeling under high temperatures but the area cultivating vegetables in these regions is comparatively lesser than Pune, Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur and Nashik districts.""Meanwhile, Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) sources added that this is the hottest of several summers in the recent past and the increasing heat has already dented the supply of vegetables into Pune's wholesale market by 40%.An APMC official affirmed that vegetable supply in the wholesale market has dipped off late. ""It is not that vegetables deteriorate after arriving in the market; they are rotting in fields due to exposure to high temperature. Almost 40% of the vegetables are destroyed on the field itself owing to the heat,"" the official said.A senior official from Maharashtra's commissionerate of agriculture (horticulture) said that the shortage of water in such regions coupled with the high heat hampers the fruit-bearing process in plants, leading to a dip in production."

A few vegetables are selling at more than Rs 80 per kg in some areas.Vegetable supply in the local market, meanwhile, has dropped since March first week owing to summer setting in and shortage of water in vegetable producing regions in the state, said sources in Pune Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC).Retail prices of vegetables have gone up in tandem with wholesale prices, though the increase in latter has been less than the retail prices.A senior APMC official told TOI that the rise in wholesale prices of vegetables has been between 15% and 20% during the last few days.

""High temperature during the day, followed by chilly night temperature affects the growth and quality of leafy greens like fenugreek, coriander, spinach and even cluster beans.

Ganesh , 38, one of the farmers at Periya Muthaali village where the wall broke, said, ""The side wall of the canal of Kelavarapalli dam had broken many a times. This time, the range of loss is high as the floodwater submerged around 100 acres of fertile land,"" he said.Another farmer S Manjunath , 34, said farmers have faced huge loss due to negligence on the part of public works department (PWD). ""The right side of the canal wall had been broken a year ago. At the time, the PWD officials simply placed sand bags instead of constructing a new wall,"" he said.

The health benefit of preparing food in earthen pots was known to our ancestors, and has been an intrinsic part of the Indian kitchen. However, the tradition vanished with the arrival of steel and aluminum vessels.The canteen, in business for about 15 years now, started using earthen pot only four months ago. They serve palav for Rs 40, which includes more leafy green vegetables and rice. Healthy seeds, dry fruits, ghee, pickle and curd give the food an original taste. ""We use 35 healthy ingredients in the palav. People who are health conscious come here for their meal,"" said Narayan, the cook at the canteen.Ganesh, a customer, said, ""I have food here every day. From my experience, I bet no expensive food matches the health benefits available here. Many people think that paying more gives you healthier food, it's not so. We should prepare such food at home too, and include rural medicinal plants which are ignored.""On the health benefit of clay pots, Dr Chandra Shekhar Aithal from Udupi said, ""Clay has a porous quality. While cooking, heat and moisture circulate through the pot, unlike in metal or enamel-lined pots. Most pots are made with micaceous clay (clay containing mica flecks), which acts as a natural insulator. The speciality of these pots is that the clay is alkaline based, hence it interacts with acidity in the food, neutralizing the pH balance. Cooking in clay pots gives you calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, sulphur and several other compounds that benefit our body. It has the power to control diabetes and blood pressure.""The original Udupi fish curry is prepared in clay pots in villages. Shankari, 67, from Nellikatte, Udupi, said this fish curry can be had for three days without it spoiling. In fact, as it matures, the taste improves, and it just needs to be heated every day.""Making rice in clay pots is difficult because it should be handled with care, but curry can be made easily. I love dishes prepared in pots. These pots are naturally very acidic; hence when we cook tomato in it, it gets a natural sweetness,"" said Shankari."

The market itself is barely spread over a few acres of land and the storage facilities are extremely primitive,"" K Ayappa, a wholesale dealer from the market said.""We cannot operate beyond a particular volume on a daily basis and are forced to reject stock as the storage facilities are virtually non-existent.

Bananas do not have much shelf life like most fruits. However, there is no way of storing it. The sheds and buildings are in deplorable conditions.

""Let the government build a modern multi-tiered refrigerated storage facility for high-end fruits and vegetables. The traders can ensure that they are available over an extended period of time, handle more volumes and reduce the price. Products such as potatoes, tomatoes and even mangoes can be sold better this way. Maybe in the short run, the expenses will be high.

In spite of heavy rains and a spurt in farm productivity, the scourge of suicides continues to spread. The highest number of suicides was in Beed (23), hometown of rural minister Pankaja Munde, followed by Nanded (22), Osmanabad (19), Aurangabad (18), Jalna (14), Parbhani and Hingoli (8 each) and Latur (5). Of the 117 cases, financial aid was provided to 46 families of the deceased. But 13 were denied relief and 58 proposals are still being processed.Head of a state-level task force on farmer welfare, Kishore Tiwari, said while the government had taken various measures, the results were not visible. ""We'll have to redraft our strategy to halt farmer suicides,"" Tiwari said. ""We will have to provide remunerative prices for agriculture produce, along with market intervention. A plan needs to be worked out to provide education to farmers' children and financial assistance for healthcare.""In 2016, production of tur, tomato, onion and most vegetables doubled and even tripled but farm gate prices dipped. Onion was sold for Rs 460 per quintal as against the production cost of Rs 950. Tur farmers were paid less than the minimum support price (MSP) in wholesale markets. The MSP for tur was Rs 5,050 and traders were purchasing it at Rs 4200-4400 per quintal.However, a comparison with figures for the previous year show a marginal decline in toll. According to data, 3,052 farmers ended their lives in 2016, of which 1,053 cases were from Aurangabad, which falls in Marathwada region. The 117 cases recorded in 2017, if seen against the average bi-monthly rate for the previous year, indicates a slight downturn. Incidentally, the same trend is visible for 2015 and 2016. Against a total of 3,052 farmers who killed themselves in 2016, the toll was higher at 3,228 in 2015, which was a drought year.Leader of opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil said over the last two and half years, 9,000 farmers have killed themselves. ""We demand that Fadnavis declare a total loan waiver to protect the farmers' lives."" Patil led an opposition delegation recently which called on Governor Vidyasagar Rao to press for their demand."

What happened in the panchayat polls in 2015 when the BJP was wiped out will be repeated in the Assembly polls, Mr. Patel told The Hindu in an interview.According to him, the ruling BJP will pay a heavy price for the excesses during the agitation in which a dozen persons were killed in police firing and women beaten up. A dozen people were killed in police firing. We were sent to jail on sedition charge. Police thrashed our women in our own homes.

Like the rest of India, here in Jewar, , despite a good harvest, there are no takers for the produce.Distraught farmers blame the market meltdown on demonetisation . There's a glut, but procurement prices have crashed over the last two months. With cash flow still disrupted, farmers are selling at throw-away rates.Local vendors on carts and at roadside stalls are selling vegetables at Rs 5-8 per kg. ""What we are picking up from farmers is selling very slowly. People are not buying much. Most farmers are selling produce at Rs 1-2 per kg,"" said Baleshwar, a middleman.

He has tomatoes, potatoes, carrots and seasonal fruits on his cart. Over a week, he expected to sell the potatoes at Rs 7/kg and carrots at Rs 10/kg, giving him an average profit of Rs 2/kg of vegetables sold, and an overall profit of Rs 300-500.Some farmers claimed the crash will continue affecting them for several months, as winter is when they make a clean profit, which helps them tide over the year's uncertainties.""We're ruined.

You tend to hear about IT companies that grow and sell their own vegetables. Sasken Technologies , a Dolmur-based company, has converted a barren piece of land into an organic kitchen garden. There's cabbage, spinach, tomato, sweet corn, okra, beans, carrot, beetroot, radish, bitter gourd, and coriander, among various others veggies to pick from. Depending on the harvest, once (sometimes, twice) a week, there is a vegetable 'mandi' inside the premises where employees can buy the fresh produce at a discount. At this two-decade-old IT firm, this has become a practice for the last three months.The idea towards greener initiative came when the company found that a 4-acre land adjacent to its office (owned by Sasken itself) wasn't being utilised completely. ""A cricket and basketball ground was in use, but an acre was vacant. Our CEO (Rajiv Mody) suggested that we do something to make it greener. By and by, we decided that we would use it to cultivate something,"" says Sunil Dath , Head-Facility Management and IT Operations.Once the idea took shape, they started cleaning up the area, sent the soil for testing to a laboratory to check the pH value to determine the kind of vegetables that could be grown, after which they started planting carrots, beetroots, spinach, corn, etc.While the produce was initially given to the employees complimentary, it is now being sold at 20 per cent less than the market rate (they have a tie-up with HOPCOMS to help them determine the rate of the vegetables on the day of the mini-market), and the money received is pumped back into buying seeds, manure, setting up a rainwater harvesting plant. In fact, for this initiative, they've specifically employed two gardeners to manage the area. This is in addition to an existing five-member gardening team.""The produce is completely organic. We don't use any chemicals or pesticides. We use sheep manure instead,"" Dath says.When the initiative was announced, employees themselves were apprehensive as to whether they would be able to pull it off. ""The manpower, the quality, whether we'd be able to grow it without pesticides - these were the questions being asked. But this initiative has proven that we have been able to channelise a vacant land into something meaningful, for employees and the environment,"" says Anees Haidary Senior Manager, Business Excellence.""What I've noticed is that the spinach I buy here remains fresh up to a week because it's organic. The regular greens available in the market don't last more than two days. And 30-40 per cent of my vegetable shopping has come down since,"" he says.The market has inspired Haidary to grow his own vegetables. ""Six weeks ago, I replanted the spinach and use the crop that's grown at home,"" he says.Agrees Indira Kuppathil, Manager-Sales Operations, Business Operations has started growing vegetables in a small patch of land at her house. ""I don't throw away any peels. I've started growing beans and dhaniya. This took off from the initiative at office. And it's also pushed me towards going organic,"" she says.Employees have started connecting with nature. They are often seen heading towards the garden to see the progress of the vegetables. ""Day-to-day stress is high. An environment-friendly initiative like this acts as a great stress-buster,"" says S Patil, Assistant Manager, Facility Management."

Wholesale traders noted that the market received only 220 truckloads of vegetables against its daily share of 300 lorries on Monday. This had led to short supply of vegetables such as carrot, brinjal, beans and beetroot.Lorries mainly from southern parts of the State refrained from transporting goods even though the Tamil Nadu State Lorry Owners Federation had announced that essential goods supply would not be affected. Dry weather and drought conditions in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka were also cited to be another reason for the steady increase in the cost of some vegetables.P.Sukumar, joint secretary, Koyambedu Fruits, Flowers and Vegetables Market, said on Monday, some vegetables, including cabbage, carrot, beans and broad beans were costlier by 25% than last week due to short supply. Vegetables such as brinjal and carrot were priced between Rs. 30-Rs. 40 a kg. The prices doubled in the initial two days of the strike as residents bought more to stock owing to strike. However, prices of onion, tomato and potato remain stable. They are sold at less than Rs. 25 a kg in wholesale market as most of the stock is procured from Maharashtra and other parts of north India. Meanwhile, about 200 traders participated in a demonstration in support of the farmers demands for loan waiver and drought relief fund."

They struggle without water if monsoon gets delayed or the storage in water bodies dwindles From Cauvery to Palar and Bhavani to Mullaperiyar, every inter-state river is caught in legal battles in the apex court. This, coupled with a severe drought across the state in 2016 leading to crops drying up, has left a majority of farmers in debt. The food grain production in the state is expected to drop by at least 30% this year, compared to 130 million tonnes last year.After complete failure of the South-West and North-East monsoons last year, most districts reported fall in area under cultivation of both agriculture and horticulture crops.Experts say standard measures like improving water efficiency and staying away from water intensive crops, especially during rabisummer season should be looked into. Drip irrigation, rain water harvesting and creation of water bodies and desilting existing ones need to be taken up on a war footing. Farmers have a collective role in pond conservation, especially deepening ponds with the provision to cover the top to reduce loss due to evaporation.Farmers stress on the need for institutions to come up with more drought-resistant high-yielding varieties.At least 50 new varieties of seeds are released across crops by private companies and educational institutions every year.But farmers say 70% of them fail on the field. ""Institutions and companies, when marketing new varieties or hybrid seeds, promise high yield which they claim they got during the three-year trials,"" said president of Tamil Nadu Farmers' Association, A Kandasamy. ""But often, after the first year, the yield starts dropping, or they become susceptible to weather changes and pests,"" he said.Farmers quote the example of the CO1variety of tomato, released around four decades ago, which initially gave high yields but failed later. ""The CO1, which they said gives 25 tonnes per hectare, did give that much initially, but was found to be susceptible to heavy rains. The yield also dropped after four years,"" said Kandasamy .""All new varieties and hybrids force us to buy new seeds every time, spending Rs 10,000 per hectare. If we use the seeds from our crop, yield falls sharply,"" said an Avinashi-based organic farmer, G Ramasamy ."

The farmers also transport their own goods to avoid paying for transportation.Sadanand Mishra, one of the farmers who dumped his stock said, ""Most of us have to travel several kilometres on cycles, carrying more than a hundred kilograms of tomatoes and after reaching there we get even less than Rs 50 for a hundred kilos. Receiving so little after toiling on the farm for months is quite discouraging. As labourers we can earn at least Rs 200 per day.""Farmers claim that a defunct cold storage facility in Uldi and the government's inability to intervene is the reason to blame.Nitin Madan Kulkarni, secretary of the agricultural department said, ""The government is taking measures to set up processing plants and cold storages, but it will take time. The farmers usually send their stock for sale in vegetable markets in West Bengal but this time they have been unable to do so. There is no Minimum Support Price (MSP) for vegetables, so we cannot help the situation.""On being asked why the storage facility in Uldi is dysfunctional, he said, ""There were around ten storage facilities started by the Welfare Department which are all dysfunctional. The situation is not in our hands.""The situation that has been created near Bundu is similar to the scenario in Lohardaga district, where farmers have been forced to dump their produce a fortnight ago."

And this is only a conservative figure coming from the government. If one goes by the figures provided by farmers' associations, the number would swell to 6-7 suicides per day. The record heat and drought of 2017 could spell disaster for the farming community in the state, which has already seen 848 suicides in 2016-17, until February.Karnataka witnessed a record 1,478 suicides in 2015-16 due to severe shortage of rainfall, which put farmers in distress. They were unable to get desired prices for their produce and were neck-deep in debt with nationalised banks and private moneylenders. Regardless of what political parties may have said, the disturbing trend has proved beyond doubt that agriculture is no more a profitable venture.Getting back to governance after a fortnight full of bypoll politics, the Siddaramaiah government has a daunting task at hand of maintaining stability in the face of a severe drought. Even though the state government is trying to make agriculture profitable, estimates by the Karnataka State Agriculture Prices Commission indicate that it's far from so.The North Karnataka districts witnessed the highest suicides last year. This year, the cloud has moved over to the Malnad areas as several reservoirs here are dry since the monsoon failed and the groundwater plummeted.While Haveri district has topped the list with 86 suicides, Dharwad district witnessed 73. The coffee-growing district of Chikka-magaluru saw 70 suicides, followed by Mysuru and Mandya with 50 and 51 suicides, respectively. Both Mysuru and Mandya depend on Cauvery River for agriculture.Four consecutive years of drought are already weighing down on Karnataka's farmers. And now, reckless use of groundwater to compensate for the poor monsoon has only made things worse for them. The state budget, which made no mention of a loan-waiver, came as a huge disappointment for them.Kuruburu Shanthakumar, president of the sugarcane growers association, said: ""The government should have planned to prevent suicides. It failed to learn from last year's mistakes and the result is that even this year, there have been suicides. In less than one-and-a -half-years, as per our estimate, close to 3,000 farmers have committed suicide across Karnataka. Our only demand is that the government must stop loan recovery and waive off the loan. Shivanna (52) of Mandya district committed suicide when bank authorities slapped notices on him for the repayment of a loan of Rs 5 lakh. His entire paddy crop had perished as there was no water in the Cauvery basin this year.""While Siddaramaiah has made it clear that the Centre should waive the loan, farmers have a different understanding of the logic. ""If he (the CM) can give others, why can't he give to us? The CM claims that he cannot waive off the loan, but he has money to appoint a pay commission to revise the salaries of state government employees, which runs into several crores. If the exchequer is short of money, what was the reason for the government to procure new vehicles for presidents of zilla panchayat and taluk panchayat? What was binding on the government to increase the salary of MLAs, MLCs and ministers? Farmers and agriculture are not a priority for this government and it has been proved time and again,"" said Shanthakumar.Besides estimating that growing several crops would actually leave a farmer in loss, the Karnataka Agriculture Price Commission has attributed the continuing trend of farmer suicides to demonetisation and unscientific cropping pattern.TN Prakash Kammaradi, chairman of the com-mi-ssion, said: ""Demo-ne-tisation has literally taken money out of markets. Because of this, there is no purchase of produce in the market. When there is no purchase in market, how can you ensure profit for farmers?""""The centre should have been more proactive in this regard rather than leaving things entirely to the states. Instead, it is going in for zero duty import of pulses and sugar, which will be detrimental to our farmers.""Rather than importing, the same money should have been diverted and given to farmers as a minimum support price (MSP). Centre's policies are driven by inflation and consumer interests rather than to benefit farmers,"" he said.Prakash also opined that the unscientific cropping pattern and season-bound production of crops has also resulted in severe losses.""In some regions, farmers take to the cultivation of just one crop, resulting in excess production and fall in prices. Under favourable conditions, all farmers in Kalaburagi go after tur dal or farmers in Kolar flood the market with tonnes of tomatoes. We need to have a proper cropping plan and farmers have to stick to such rules to get effective prices for their produce,"" he said.Considering the market fluctuation until December 2016, the Karnataka Agriculture Price Commission has estimated loss and profit per acre for cultivation of each crop across Karnataka. As per the report, cultivating several staple crops would actually result in losses for farmers.Even though a few crops bring in profits, it would be insignificant. Cultivating several crops such as paddy, ragi (finger millet), foxtail millet, urad dal, sunflower, and coconut has only caused losses."

BHP, was still assessing the extent of any disruption to shipments.Queensland's top insurers, Suncorp Group Ltd and RACQ, said it was too early to put a dollar figure on the damage.Severe damage has been inflicted on vegetable and fruit crops in the Bowen and Mackay areas, with potential harm to this year's sugar crop which was due to be harvested in about six weeks' time.The wide region impacted by the cyclone contributes over A$1 billion of agricultural production annually, providing about 95 percent of Australia's winter supply of tomatoes and capsicums, said John Peters, senior economist at Commonwealth Bank.Tourism is another area that has taken a big hit from Debbie, with damage to popular resorts particularly in Whitsundays island which alone accounts for about 10 percent of Australia's tourism earnings.While a lower GDP will not be welcomed by the Reserve Bank of Australia, it is likely to look through the volatility in the data when setting policy rates. It holds its next policy meeting on April 4.The deleterious impact of the cyclone will likely be short-term with rebuilding and repair activity expected to prop up economic growth in coming months, economists said.""The State, Federal and local governments will rebuild damaged rail, roads, buildings and bridges,"" Peters said.""The private sector will also rebuild the port facilities, marinas, and tourism areas.

""Farmers come there to auction their produce to sellers from Koyambedu. Sellers in turn sell it to other wholesale dealers in Chennai in bulk boxes like 200, 100 and 50. These dealers in turn distribute to warehouses or retail shops, who in sell it to the customer. On average the produce changes hands six times and becomes that much more expensive for customers and farmers, who have to pay a commission to truck loaders,"" said Rajamohan.With E-Vegetailing middlemen are eliminated and farmers can get the full market price for their products.""We have to pay a 10% commission to truckers who pick up our goods. Going online has helped our goods fetch better prices at zero commission,"" Palaniswamy said.Another differentiater is the startup's revenue model.""We don't charge the farmers, we charge only the customers.

Made of upcycled, recycled and economised paper and other materials, it has the seed of an Agasthya (Sesbania grandiflora) tree at its bottom end. On World Environment Day 2016, the pens were handed out to a group of school children in the State who have also been using the pen.The Ganesh Chathurthi festival is always a nightmare for environmental activists owing to its aftermath - large numbers of paper mache 'Ganeshas' in the waterbodies.Last year, however, several groups across the country made news, for giving a twist to the popular Ganapathy idols. Instead of using environmentally hazardous materials for the idols which in turn pollute the water bodies they are immersed into, the new Ganapathy was way cooler and 'pregnant' with something useful and helpful for the environment. Termed Tree Ganesha or Green Ganesha, the idols were eco-friendly, made of red soil and organic fertilisers, with seeds as its base. Even when you aren't planning to immerse the idol, you can use water to disintegrate the Ganesha, which would turn into soil that nurtures the seeds.Pencils made of wood or plastic might soon be a thing of the past, if these ec-friendly pencils win more of hearts. Made from used newspapers, the pencils, called Eco-Me was launched last year in Coimbatore by an environment enthusiast. They are made of old newspapers and chemical-free, waterproof glue and are thus safe for kids, who use it like any normal pencil.No, we aren't talking about the commonly used rudraksha chain, but a variety of pretty neck pieces and bangles made by a group in Trichy. The necklaces, anklets and earrings are made by stringing together rice kernels, various medicinal plants, coral tree seeds and canna seeds. The seeds used are not poisonous or perishable, and belong to the widely available category of seeds, consciously avoiding the endangered varieties."

That has been the temple town's calling card and commerce. But foodies know that Varanasi's crowded streets and bylanes are also avenues of gastronomic delights. Many famous hawkers appear with their pushcarts in the evening. Some don't even have a signboard. Hygiene isn't their forte. But their offerings -- golgappas, rasedar pakoras, lassi - are addictive and available at a price that would buy you only a snigger in a city like Delhi.Quality street food, to anybody who pursues it like an obsessive lover, isn't just about feeling good. The best snacks take you into an unchartered zone where the taste buds groan with delight. It's like discovering an unknown erogenous zone. In their own way, the street-side hawkers of Varanasi are everyday artists in the business of producing and peddling pleasure.You might get that kind of feeling wolfing down Lalman's golgappas, or paani puris, sold from a handcart in a bylane near Lahurabir Chowk. What makes them irresistible isn't the tangy tamarind water but the filling, a slushy mix of chickpea, boiled potato and spices. He also serves a sweet version of the snack that feels almost like a dessert. Like most golgappa sellers in the city, the stuff he serves is customized to the amount of spicy heat your tastebuds can handle. Varanasi is a city of paan eaters. A long-lasting love affair with the paan makes a tongue hypersensitive to spice. This is primarily due to the use of chuna (lime), an essential ingredient for paan; hence the adjustment.Like Lalman, there are several other artistes of the palate strewn across the city, which is now Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's Lok Sabha constituency. One of the go-to places for breakfast is the late Chhanni Devi's, who sold puri-sabji and jalebis from a rundown shop in Lanka area, near BHU. Popularly known as ""Chachi"", she showered abuse on customers asking her to hurry up; the customers, in turn, were addicted to her rantings.Among the famous who graced the place was superstar Rajesh Khanna. The sabji served with the puri is made of pumpkin, potatoes and black gram. There is a rhythm with which her son Kailash Yadav flattens and shapes the dough before it is deep-fried, twice. The shop opens at 3.30 am. ""We start serving jalebis by 5 am and puri-sabji by 6. By 11.30 am, we are through,"" he says. A plate of four puris and sabji costs Rs 24.Adjacent are three shops selling lassi, all run by sons of Panna Sardar who ran the legendary original Pehalwan lassi. This is the third generation in the business. Lassis, with a dash of malai and saffron on top, are sold in clay cups. Some are so thick you almost need to chew.A kulhar (clay cup) of lassi is about beauty in minimalism. No frills; just the best of natural ingredients: curd made of buffalo milk, sugar and a hint of rosewater or saffron. It's part of the city's living heritage, created and consumed every day, sustained by a commitment to tradition. Places like these created a popular expression called 'Lanketing', going specifically to Lanka for snacks.Then there's Pappu's, the legendary tea stall in Assi mohalla that serves milk and lemon tea. The political gyan is free. The lemon tea here is flavoured with Hajmola, giving it a distinct whiff of heeng (asafoetida).There's much more. Near Lahurabir Chowk stands Jwala Prasad 's push cart selling rasedar pakora made of gram flour (besan), spinach and spices. The three are kneaded into a ball, deep fried and dipped in a fiery curry. Then it's served with a sprinkling of sohal, a salty savoury. The pakoras have two variations: sada and rangeen. The rangeen version is stuffed with bhang, a popular intoxicant generally laced with sweets.At Chetganj, Umashankar Sahu's family has been selling kachoris for three generations. As a peddler, Sahu has the smallest of stands where he keeps the kachoris, a little larger than a Rs 10 coin, garnished with shredded radish and carrot, and served with tamarind chutney.Varanasi is also famous for its sweets to which the city's Bengalis have also made a singular contribution. Shops with signs of desi and Bengali mithai can be seen. Some shops located around Pucca Mohal area along the ghats, sell their stuff only between 7 pm to 2 am. On offer are sweets suggestively named: Palangtod (Bed-breaker) and Malaipuri.One has deliberately avoided referring to the iconic Kashi and Deena Chat Bhandars at Godowlia Chowk which are more established joints. Crowds, including tourists, throng to Deena for a taste of their tamatar chaat, a rather unique snack which uses tomatoes ingeniously and which is eaten out of kullars. In the winter, chura matar, dripping with desi ghee, is the rage.Sometimes one wonders why food doesn't figure in the narrative of the holy city. Is it because it is primarily a business of yadavs and baniyas, who don't figure high in the city's intellectual story? There is no simple answer.What one does know is that there is a self-confidence to Varanasi; the way it looks at life, culture, and itself. The eternal city seems to stand a little above everything it surveys. There is a rhythm to its existence that's yet unspoiled by the ravages of time. And food is an inseparable part of it."

And, in northern Kerala, kidney stone is becoming a major health concern among workers in the Gulf.V.G. Pradeep Kumar, president, Kerala chapter, Indian Medical Association, said that over 80% of kidney diseases in the State were induced by hypertension and high blood sugar.Lifestyle changes are the main villain. The IMA has been running campaigns to create awareness on the issue. Many government hospitals now have lifestyle clinics which are addressing it, Dr. Kumar said.According to a study, around 30% of adults in Kerala are diabetic and 16% have high blood pressure. M. Thomas Mathew, former professor at Kozhikode Medical College, who is now senior consultant nephrologist at Baby Memorial Hospital here, said that those with high cholesterol levels too were at a higher risk of developing kidney diseases. The number of diabetic patients is more in Alappuzha and Pathanamthitta districts, he said.Kidney stone is another common problem found among the labourers who return from Gulf countries. It is caused by the extreme weather conditions in those countries and the contaminated water they consume. They use a lot of tomato in their food, like tomato juice and sauces. This leads to calcium deposits and later kidney stones, Dr. Mathew said.Focus on lifestyleHe said that increased focus on lifestyle changes would help prevent these problems.Regular health check-ups and screening blood and urine tests are a must. Smoking and alcohol consumption should be avoided. Control of diet, blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol and regular physical exercise will help, he said.Theme for the yearTo highlight these risks and to mark World Kidney Day, hospitals such as Baby Memorial Hospital and organisations such as the IMA are holding screening and awareness camps in the city on Thursday. The theme for this year is kidney diseases and obesity and overweight and how can it be prevented.World Kidney Day80% of kidney diseases induced by hypertension and high blood sugar30% of adults in Kerala are diabetic and 16% have high blood pressureKidney stone a major health concern among workers in the GulfIMA, hospitals to hold screening and awareness camps today"

58f96567a3d24b0b70c3f686,Charting the fascinating path that robots have taken over the years,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/Charting-the-fascinating-path-that-robots-have-taken-over-the-years/article17244710.ece,2017-02-08,,The Hindu,"Introductory speeches are commonplace at press launches, but far rarer is for one of them to be delivered by a robot. RoboThespian, a lanky, luminescent, human-like robot, who will be on display at the London Science Museums blockbuster exhibition charting the history robots, is a charismatic speaker, with the animated intonation of a confident orator, and digital eyes that focus and look around in an eerily-human way.Precisely when robots came to be created does of course depend on ones definition of a robot, and as curator Ben Russell points out there are 30 or 40 different characterisations. The exhibition links robots to our quest to recreate ourselves in mechanized form and therefore takes the starting point as around 500 years ago, when in the 16th century, the quest to understand the workings of the human body spurred the creation of mechanical devices. On display is one of the earliest such automated pieces: an automaton monk from 1560, created for Philip II of Spain, which could pray and walk across the table, moving its lips and raising its crucifix. Theres a spectacular silver swan from the 18th century that attracted huge crowds at the time with its ability to elegantly sway and pick up ornamental fish and lots of other fascinating mechanical pieces from across the world.However it wasnt till the 20th century that the word robot was coined: derived from the Czech word robota which means forced labour, and which was used by author Karel apek in his 1920 play about artificial humans, Rossums Universal Robots . It was also at this stage that robots began to take the shape that we traditionally associate with them the metallic, somewhat humanoid figures that have dominated literature and film. Theres a replica of one of the earliest  the Maria robot used in Fritz Langs film Metropolish in 1927, and Eric , one of the earliest ones made in the U.K.Artificial intelligenceIt was in the 1950s that the quest to imbue robots with intelligence and the ability to operate without remote control or a microphone began. On display is a cybernetic tortoise from 1951 that had the ability to find its own way. The exhibition also highlights the huge range of ways robots are capable of aiding human life: from those used in factories to the home, and even one capable of acting as a mediator for children with autism, helping them learn about human interaction.However, many challenges remain, as the exhibition carefully sets out. It highlights some of the current research under way, in particular efforts to create robots that are able to learn from humans and its surroundings. Theres Lucy, a British robot with 50,000 artificial neurons that over a period of years has learned to distinguish bananas and apples, and iCub, one of an Italian series of 30 robots that mimic toddlers, as they learn to discover the world around them, through their senses, learning as they go.However, surprisingly to many, the biggest challenge, lies not in artificial intelligence, but in something more fundamental, says Will Jackson, the director of Engineered Arts, the British company behind RoboThespian. Software is way ahead but the biggest challenge is mechanical, he says, noting that we are yet to have a robot capable of sustained and close human interaction and replicating the preciseness of human beings, or the strength of our muscles.The exhibition is open at the Science Museum in central London from February 8 to September 3, 2017."
