Its good to dump our crop on the road, he said.While some farmers blamed it on demonetisation and cash crunch, Shajapur mandi secretary Rajesh Mishra dismissed the allegations, saying high supply and low demand had caused the prices to fall.The Madhya Pradesh government had announced facilities such as cash vans and transport subsidy for farmers to face cash crunch, but farmers claimed they are yet to receive them.According to sources, the daily supply of tomatoes at Shajapur mandi is around 200 to 300 crates as many farmers are sending their crop directly to Bhopal and Indore markets.They claimed that the rates were decent at Indore and Bhopal mandis."

Trap them.""In one protest last month, dozens of taxi drivers posed as would-be passengers, flooding the app with requests before forcing the Uber drivers from their vehicles, much to the bemusement of onlookers.The management of taxis in Morocco normally falls to local government. The transport ministry has so far kept quiet as to why Uber continues to operate in the streets of Casablanca.- 'Illegal and unauthorised' -""Our position hasn't changed,"" a senior official from Casablanca's local administration told AFP. ""We see (Uber) as an unauthorised and illegal company.""Local media said recently that as many as 30 separate protests against app drivers had been held, ranging from threats, car chases and even ambushes such as the one in DecemberUber Morocco director general Meryem Belqziz insisted these were ""isolated"" incidents.""There were no injuries. It was more harassment,"" she told AFP, admitting however that Uber drivers had been ""shaken"" by some protests.There are now more than 250 taxis working for Uber in Casablanca, Belqziz said, and the app has enjoyed 15,000 unique users in the last three months.Business has boomed for Uber since it launched in San Francisco in 2011.But the smartphone app has faced stiff resistance from traditional taxi drivers the world over, as well as bans in some places over safety concerns and questions over legal issues, including taxes.Uber says it is not a transport company like taxi firms, and that it simply connects drivers with passengers.While many drivers have been tempted by Uber's model, many more operators of Casablanca's estimated 18,000 taxis continue to denounce the app's ""unfair competition"", while passengers still heavily rely instead on local ride startups such as Careem and chauffeur.ma.The recent opening of a new tram line in the city has also siphoned off some of the local drivers' traditional clientele.""The tram has already eaten up an important part of our market, and things are getting worse with Uber, which operates without constraint,"" said Abdelouahed.Belqziz insists that Uber and local taxis can operate side-by-side, but admits her firm's legal status ""needs clarifying"".""With every important change you meet resistance, but with time people get used to new modes of consumption,"" she said."

(K Giri Babu | EPS)Rucksack on my back I stepped down at the Tirupati railway station early one morning last week, and found that something was amiss. I ought to have heard the passenger ahead of me, peaceable until now, break out into a full-throated Govinda, Govinda! slogan by now. At this time of the year, the station is normally packed with devotees either going to the Venkateshwara temple on Tirumala hill or returning from from there. But the platform was sparse with the odd peasant family from the interiors lolling on a bedroll on the bare floor and bleary-eyed returnees picking up their luggage and briskly making for exits. Even the man at the kiosk outside the station yodeling to passengers to buy bus tickets to Tirumala was not being very successful. Was this the demonetisation effect, I wondered.After refreshments, I drove out of town into Rayalaseema's parched hinterland of hillocks and precarious rock formations that threaten drama but never deliver. Rayalaseema lends itself to both cynics and poets. The former call it Rallaseema (country of rocks) and latter Ratanalaseema (country of rubies). The cynics are winning right now. A timeless drought has taken grip of this region, enveloping everyone, businessmen, small-time traders, farmers, students, poets, cynics, in an indolent stupor.I first stopped at Srinivasa Mangapuram, which lies on one of the two routes taken by trekkers to reach the big temple on Tirumala. This town too is sacred, having its own temple to the same god, but presented as the Kalyana Venkateswara. Hymns recited by priests in the temple wrapped the area in a spiritual aura. The first man I met said he was a tailor from Keelapatla, a village 75 km in the interior. He and his family had walked the distance to go to the Tirumala temple and decided to do the mandatory Srinivasa Mangapuram detour. He said he wasnt happy. I have had no business in the past two months, Prakash said. We are going to Tirumala to pray so that we may have something to live for. My family needs at least Rs 200 per day. Im not making even that. As proof of his determination, Prakash showed me the blisters on the soles of his feet. They had been trekking for two days with a four-hour break at Kanipakam, another holy stopover on the Tirumala pilgrim circuit.I stepped over to a juicers stall to see if he had it any better. B Guravaiah repeated to me the tailors story in much the same manner, doleful but hopeful at the same time. I am not making even Rs. 200 a day, said the vendor. The devotees are coming but no one comes to me for a drink.I continued my journey along the ghat road skirting the Seshachlam forests, home to rare red sanders woods and smugglers of the wood and hunters of the smugglers. In 2016, the troika made for a dysfunctional ecosystem that kept journalists like me busy reporting their skirmishes but now as 2017 beckoned, the forest was an inviting diversion. The scene from the window of my taxi was sylvan and the green canopy seemed to awn over all the difficulties of the past two months.When soon the woods parted company with me, I decided to break at Bhakrapet and walked over to a group of youngsters on bikes who had stopped by the roadside. They were students of Sri Venkateswara Ayurvedic College in Tirupati. They were on their way to Talakona to see the waterfall there. How had the past year been?It was good. In fact, very good. My sister and my brother got married in May and August. And Ill get married in 2017, said one of the happy boys.Does he love her? Oh no, my parents settled the match. I believe in arranged marriage, he said, breaking out in titters.He said his name was Balakrishna and his home was Mahbubnagar, Telangana. He is studying for an MD degree in ayurvedic medicine and his hope for 2017 was to set up a practice in his native town.Another of the bikers, Dr Chakaradhar, said he was looking forward to his wedding too, next year. Im engaged. And after marriage I will set up a clinic at home in Kadapa, he said.A few miles out of Bhakrapet, I was back in the droughtscape of Rayalaseema with the happy conversation with the bikers still on my mind. At Kalagada on the Kadapa-Chittoor border, I stopped to eavesdrop on a roadside argument. It was a farmer cursing strangers passing by. After the assembly had dispersed, I asked him his name. Riaz Ali Khan was a tomato farmer. He said he had lost seven lakh rupees on his last crop. I sowed three acres. Last year I sold for Rs 500 per box. Now they are offering me Rs 30 per box. Id rather let the fruit rot on the plants. I wont throw them on the road because I have respect for tomatoes, he said to me, still indignant.If it is your livelihood, you should respect the crop, right?Back on my route, the Veligalla reservoir suddenly appeared on the horizon and I looked for a tinge of green in the landscape around me. The land was barren. I stopped to talk to a farmer on a farm adjacent to the canal. He was working a kerosene-fuelled pump to irrigate his eight-acre groundnut crop. Im quite happy, he said to my surprise. Last year was fine. And the new year promises to be good too.How had demonetisation affected him? He managed, he said. I have a problem in getting small notes to pay my labourers, though. If I get good crop, Ill get a good price. I invested Rs 40,000 per acre and I should easily get Rs 80,000.He had a vermilion teeka on his forehead, so I asked him about Narendra Modi. If he waives crop loans, it will be good. he said.I moved on to Kadiri in Anantapur, Andhra Pradeshs drought district, as dusk descended. The town was dusty and the lights had not come on in the shops. I stopped to ask a watch repairer if there was a power cut. There is supply, sir. But traders are not switching on the lights because there is no business for them, the man said.His name was Zebi and he wanted to talk. Show me one shop with any customers. Look at my shop. Its only 5.30 and I am getting ready to close. Everyone wants to save money on power.Kadiri, in his telling, was a cursed town: no industries, no rains and no crops. We get drinking water for one hour once in three to four days and it has very high flouride content. If they dont do something, this town will die, Zebi declared.I then ducked into a basket weavers shop on the main street of Kadiri. Eshwaraiah did not have great expectations for the new year either. Bamboo baskets are on the way out. People are buying plastic baskets and tubs. Many basket weavers have moved to Bangalore to work as labourers."

The trend that started after Onam is expected to continue until March if not for any unexpected natural event.Of the 23 items under the tubers and vegetables category in the ESD list, 17 have lower prices than previous January with some like carrot and tomato showing over 40 per cent dip. Exceptions are elephant foot yam, tapioca, colocasia, cucumber, banana and plantain which recorded 4-56 per cent hike in prices.While the milk price is stable, a dozen white leghorn eggs now cost Rs 1.40 less. V P Jayakumar, a vegetable trader in Chalai market and a former office-bearer of the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi, said now there was a surplus supply of vegetables from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, unlike previous years.Prices are down after Onam and the situation is likely to continue until March, he said.Cereal is one category that survived the downfall trend and firmed up. Except Chamba rice, all other rice varieties showed an upward trend, 7-18 per cent growth from previous January. Sugar too recorded a 23 per cent growth. According to Satheesh R N, Supplycos marketing manager, the new governments decision to sell 13 commodities at the same rate during its tenure has helped control the prices of major cereals and pulses.The 1,400-odd outlets of Supplyco help our consumerist state to control food prices. Commodities other than the 13 classified items are sold at prices 40-50 per cent less than the market rate. FMCGs are sold at 2-30 per cent discount, he added."

A lot of problems in the agriculture sector are due to floods and droughts caused by climate change, Swaminathan said, adding focus should also be on providing convenient loans to women farmers to encourage participation.Right to Food campaigner Dipa Sinha dubbed the Budget a continuation of disappointments, especially for women and child welfare. There is focus on maternity benefit, which is good, but the funds allocated for it will not be sufficient for its universal applicability, she said. She was surprised that the finance minister chose to give malnutrition a pass, particularly after it was sharply brought to focus recently with several tragic deaths in Maharashtra."

Students are given lectures thrice a week on how to maintain the garden by urban farming groups like Start Upcycling Now (SUN) and iKheti, which helped the school to set up the garden.The project started in July 2016 after Father Gregory, the schools manager, roped in 240 students of Class 8 and explained the idea. Fascinated by the idea of having their own garden, the students immediately swung into action. Each class is divided into four sections and each division was assigned four gardens each.In a concrete jungle like Mumbai, a terrace garden awakens a sense of environmental consciousness and becomes a forum for knowledge. It also provides a variety of organic and fresh vegetables right at your doorstep, said Father Gregory.He added that a special period has been dedicated for the students to do the gardening work, which includes watering the plants, planting new vegetables, adding soil and compost or removing saplings, everything is done in the Work Experience period once a week.To execute the project, students created soil beds using clay bricks. A plastic sheet was spread on the brick base to prevent water from seeping through. Later, seven inch thick soil layer is spread on the plastic and is mixed with mulch comprising shredded cardboard and dry leaves. This helps soil to retain moisture even on the hot days.We should not just teach students phrases, but also make them apply those in real life. This is their real education. Now, they are so involved in it that they even utilise their recess time nurturing the plants, said Gracy Solomon, principal, OLPS.StudentspeakCommenting on the initiative, Razeen Sayyed, 13, said, We (each division) get 30 minutes with our respective gardens during which we must ensure that everything is fine with the crop. If everything is okay, and we are left with some time, we make self-irrigation bottles.The terrace garden produces brinjals, tomatoes, ladies fingers (okra), lemon grass, lemons and carom seeds (ajwain), which is appreciated not only by their treachers but also the monkeys who visit the garden in search of fresh vegetables.Monkeys eat our entire tomato crop. So to keep them at bay, we installed a scare crow, said Aaradhya Patil, 13.On each patch of garden, there are boards with information on the plants and their uses. For example, pentas plant is used as a popular medicine in malaria and lime to relieve asthma.Kids should understand how the plants are grown from scratch and that even a day of not watering can take away all their hard work, said Priyanka Shah, founder, iKheti, adding In this way, they also learn to respect food and become sensitive towards the environment.Organic fertilisersThe compost that they use in the garden comes from the waste created in the school campus. The school has eight drums in a set of four for each division where they dump organic waste, which is later used as fertiliser.Students do all the legwork they can for the environment. Aerobic composting is something that you just have to dump it and almost everything else is taken care of the microorganisms. The students of the school make sure that no waste goes out to the dump yard from the school, said Natasha DCosta, SUN founder.After the crop comes to fruition, the saplings are handed over to the students. Sanket Gauri, a student of Class VIII, said, We showed it to our parents and friends, and now even they want to be a part of it. My neighbours liked it so much that they want to start gardening on our terrace as well.The students are not just young environmentalists, but they are exceptional in studies as well. They recently won a Science Club Competition last year.My favourite subject is Maths, but this [terrace gardening] is Science, Chemistry, Geography and all other subjects put to practice, said Essakkimuthu Konar, 14, as he held his self-irrigation bottle with his name labelled on it.Also read: Teen powers change, helps buildings, schools recycle 350 kg of batteries"

Photos: P.K. Badiger and SANTOSH SAGAR: Farmers of two districts marked the new year in an unusual manner. Utter frustration and helplessness drove cabbage growers of some villages in Belagavi district to feed their fresh crop to cattle, while tomato growers in Raichur distributed the produce for free.The crash in prices is being attributed to a glut in the harvest as well as the shortage of cash caused by demonetisation. This has resulted in traders refusing procurement, or quoting low prices.The price of cabbage crashed to Rs. 1 to Rs. 1.2 a kg in some of the wholesale markets in Belagavi district whereas in November, it was selling at Rs. 700 to Rs. 800 a quintal.Tomato growers in Raichur are also in dire straits. When a few farmers brought their produce to the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee yard in Raichur, commission agents and traders refused to offer them more than Rs. 1 a kg. Helpless, they began giving away nearly six quintals of tomatoes for free in the Teenkandil locality of the city.Such a low price does not even meet the cost of cultivation, let alone transportation expenses, said a farmer. There is no point in taking the produce back home as not only is tomato a perishable commodity, it will also incur more transportation charges.A bountiful yield has hardly brought cheer to these farmers. Lakshmanagowda Kadgamdoddi, district president of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, alleged that the price crash was a strategy of APMC traders and commission agents, who purchase from tomato growers in other regions and States on credit. Hence, there was no demand for the produce of local growers, who were being forced to sell at whatever price the traders quote, he said."

Earlier, two trucks were loaded for Delhi, Punjab, and Pakistan daily, but this year only one truck is loaded every two days for Haryana and Punjab.""Interestingly, while farmers were finding it difficult to sell their produce even at Re 1 per kg, the wholesale price in the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), Ahmedabad, |ranged between Rs 2 and Rs 5 per kg. However, the retail price ranged between Rs 10 and Rs 20 per kg.Patel said that farmers of the area want the government to come forward and purchase the produce at about Rs 4 per kg so that farmers are able to get the basic cost if not profit. Patel said that on Tuesday no fewer than 20 tractors had come to sell their produce but traders, locally known as kantawalas, were not willing to buy. Rajesh Patel, another farmer from the area, said, ""Following tension on the border, purchase by traders has halved. Earlier, we were not willing to sell tomatoes to Pakistan, but now we hope that tension eases and we get some money."" Kaushik Patel, also a farmer from the area, said: ""The situation was so bad that farmers are now replacing their tomato crops with bajri."" Patel said that in his 7 bigah of land he gets around 6,000 kg per bigah of tomato. This year the crop was good compared to the previous years, he said."

Cattle were also being fed with cauliflower, coriander leaves and brinjal among others on Saturday. A bumper production has led to the situation where the rates of vegetables especially tomato have nosedived. The perishable commodity in abundance was sold at Rs 10 a crate containing 10 kg in Bina, said Sunderlal Patel a farmer.""The middlemen or adhatiya in local language has been exploiting the farmers who has not been able to pay the transport charges to ferry the produce from farmlands to mandi,"" he said.

Some villagers take them away for their cattle as well, said another farmer Babloo Kushwah, resident of Khimlasa village, 18 kms away from Bina.

58e532c37be9e05a951f57d1,Glut and cash crunch spawn a tomato torment,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1170107/jsp/nation/story_129016.jsp,2017-01-07,"Nagpur, Jan. 6: The monsoon was good this year, the climate perfect and the yield bumper. Sandeep Thavkar, 28, thought his tomatoes would fetch a tidy sum. Used to growing the traditional soybean or cotton, he had gambled on tomatoes on an acre and a half of his four-acre farmland after seeing the crop fetch better returns for his neighbours in Virkhandi, 65km from Nagpur, last year. But the prices crashed even before he had begun harvesting his tomatoes, a local variety, in mid-December. Last week, 25 crates of his tomatoes, each with 25kg of the vegetable, fetched just Re 1.20 a kg. At that price, he said, he could not recover even the labour charges, let alone the cost of transport and carting and the market agent's commission. Not to mention his input costs and family labour. After returning home on December 27, Sandeep borrowed his cousin Sachin's tractor. He drove it over his standing tomato crop on which he had toiled round the clock with his wife, an elder sister and an aunt for four months: planting, weeding, watering, standing guard against pests. He did it partly in despair and partly to cut his losses. ""Tomatoes are harvested till March. I have already spent Rs 50,000 and needed to spend another Rs 20,000 on pesticides and labour to maintain the rest of the crop,"" Sandeep said. ""That would have meant more losses. I could see the prices won't rise. I'd rather gamble on another crop today and harvest it by March-April to make up some of my losses,"" he said. Sandeep, who says a price of Rs 10 a kg would have merely helped him break even, insists the prices began tumbling after the November 8 note recall announcement. But local traders in Bhiwapur and Umred towns, 20km on either side of Virkhandi village, wouldn't blame the demonetisation entirely. ""A bumper crop resulted in the price crash,"" Banti Chakole, 38, said at Umred mandi. ""Vegetable prices do fall in November-December-January every year, and this year tomatoes are in abundance."" But he conceded that the prices nose-dived after November 8. ""I have to say I have never seen the situation this bad in my 20-year career."" ""Vegetable prices go down around this time of the year because of seasonality but perhaps cash shortage has been an additional factor,"" wrote Dr Ashok Kumar Lahiri, former chief economic adviser to the Indian government, in a recent paper on demonetisation, part of a series published by the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy. Data from Nagpur's agriculture produce market committee show a sharp difference in prices before and after the demonetisation. Before November 8, Bandu Ghormade of Chicholi, 50km from Nagpur, sold his tomatoes at Rs 8 a kg - a little low, perhaps because of the glut. Yesterday the price stood at Re 1 a kg. In 2015, tomato prices in December-January averaged Rs 15 a kg for the desi variety and Rs 37.5 for the export (hybrid) variety. But between November 1 and December 25 last year, the hybrid prices fell from an average Rs 29 a kg to Rs 5.50 a kg in 29 big markets across India, the National Horticulture Board's data show. In Raipur, hybrid tomato prices fell to Rs 4 a kg. The desi variety sold at 50 paise a kg in Chhattisgarh's Jashpur district, prompting farmers to dump several tonnes of tomatoes on highways in frustration. In Wardha town, 80km from Nagpur, farmer Pramon Ranit parked his tempo in the middle of a busy square on December 27 and gave away 400 kg of his tomatoes free in four hours. The nine-acre farmer had grown tomatoes over three acres, expecting to double his Rs 1 lakh investment. But when the traders offered Re 1 per kg, he decided to earn goodwill through charity instead. On January 2, news agency ANI reported that a group of farmers, members of the Yuva Pragatisheel Kisan Sangh, gave away about one lakh kilograms of vegetables, including tomatoes, free in Raipur in protest against the demonetisation. In Virkhandi, Sandeep is wondering what to plant on his forlorn patch, freshly flattened with a tractor. Should it be the guar (a kind of bean), the Indian round gourd (tinda in Hindi) or okra? Whatever it is, what's the guarantee it will fetch a profit? ""I'll need to check the market prices and take a gamble,"" he smiles wanly."
58e53ec07be9e05a951f65ea,MORE THAN JUST COMMUNISM,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1170101/jsp/nation/story_127948.jsp,2017-01-01,"In India, the Russian Revolution and communism have come to be synonymous. But there was a time when it was not so, and a centennial year is an occasion when it is worth remembering the more complex story of inspiration and legacy that came of the events of 1917 in Russia. True, this is not easily done. By the time of Soviet disintegration in 1991, in India as in much of the world, remembering the Russian Revolution was a communist ritual, dutifully conducted on November 6. This has continued to the present. The Indian communist party press  New Age, Deshabhimani, Navayug, Ganashakti and many others  produced the striking red-edged supplements with a somewhat benign-looking Lenin staring at the world to mark the occasion. Inside, there have figured assemblages of the grand narrative of the 20th century  the rise of Soviet power and the global projection of the communist challenge, suitably adjusted to tell the nations story of communism from S.A. Dange and Muzaffar Ahmad to E.M.S. Namboodiripad, with sharp asides on which party had failed to observe which line. Meetings have tended to take place at Lenin statues through the country. The celebrations have mainly followed at Ajoy Bhavan or the communes off the Asaf Ali Road in Delhi or in places of congregation on a par with Bhupesh Bhavan in Calcutta. There would be CPI cha on offer  without milk and with a touch of lemon  a throwback to the Russian traditions that M.N. Roy, the Indian Comintern leader, noted in Moscow in 1920. This was the normal fare at Indo-Soviet communist meetings along with plates of cucumber, tomato and cheese delicately sliced with salami thrown in for non-vegetarians. Through all the fanfare, the events marked a further year of solidarity during the Cold War, and after 1991, everything that was left behind. This was solidarity built not only on political parties and trades unions but one that permeated a larger ambience. Communism and stories of the Russian Revolution were associated with the illustrated output of Soviet presses and the Peoples Publishing House that were distributed in schools  with the strains of communist marches and melodies of the communist cultural movements that were passed around on Melodiia records, magnetic tapes or CDs. The more fervent followers of communism listened to the Bengali services of Moscow Radio and the odd broadcast from the Peoples Republic of China, the former introduced by the telltale lilt of the popular song Evenings in Moscow. After 1991, the old faithful continued to look back with nostalgia. Significantly, there were marked divisions. The Revolution was celebrated independently in China and the Soviet Union, who had their own take on the occasion. In India, different parties had their own stories and legends to pass around  whether the SUCI or the RSP, CPI, CPM or the CPML. Outside the communist fraternity, newspapers docketed the experience and restricted themselves to noting one more year of the observance of its origin by the communist world from Cuba to Korea  the ritual, not the event, attracting comment. American Sovietologists pored over who was seen closest to whom at what podium in Moscow, where all spontaneity had been wrung out of the event by the heavy bureaucracy of the Soviet communist party. This harked to a complexity to the way the Revolution was received in the past but one that seldom attracted comment in the present, least of all in the USSR, which barred its own citizens let alone foreigners from free access to the archives dealing with the foundations of the Soviet state. In India, it was an unusual story. Socialism, let alone communism, attracted little discussion before 1917 and the Bolshevik uprising of October 25 (by the Julian Calendar). True, on October 23, when the now-forgotten Indian revolutionary, Virendranath Chattopadhyay, the villain of Somerset Maughams Ashenden stories, made contact with the Bolshevik establishment, he had already made interventions in socialist circles in Stockholm. But he was a true-blue nationalist who had a smattering of reading on the Left  his awareness not much off that of Har Dayal, who authored a book on Marx. For them, the Russian Revolution produced a sense of liberation  taking place as it did in the largest country in the world and one of the major powers of the day. Admirers of Russian revolutionaries, Indian revolutionaries were deeply moved by the fall of the Tsarist autocracy in February 1917. But Russias Provisional Government refused to provide even tacit support to the Indian revolutionaries based in Kabul (Mahindra Pratap, Mohammad Barkatullah and others). Bolshevik power re-ignited the magic. Not because it was a communist revolution but because it held out promise for national emancipation and, most emphatically, from its early days committed Bolshevik Russia to a quest for Indias freedom. A number of Indian revolutionaries rallied around Bolshevism during the Russian Civil War, appearing at the Baku Congress of the Workers of the East in 1920. Communism threatened to overlay nationalism on the Bolshevik agenda for India, after M.N. Roys formation of the Communist Party of India in October 1921 in Tashkent. And many duly left the ranks of fellow travellers, most well known being the revolutionaries Abdur Rab and M.P.B.T. Acharya. But, once again, the development of a Soviet civilisation model during the 1920s and 1930s, for all its inner tragedy and oppression, drew the attention of Rabindranath Tagore, Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose and, significantly, the future Swatantra Party leader Minoo Masani. As planning came to shape Indias industrial growth after 1947, the economists of the Indian Statistical Institute and the finance ministry in Delhi engaged with Moscow and Beijing to draw on their experience. The language of the Second Five Year Plan declared its socialist character  though the socialism would be home-grown and forged against the background of conflict with the CPI in Andhra and Kerala. From all this emerges the solid fact that Indias modern national ethos evolved in the shadow of the Russian Revolution; the symbols and practices of the October Revolution that was born from it entered the pattern of Indias state construction. Before and during the Cold War, the legacy of the revolution symbolised global alternatives and provided support to nationalism in an era where the countrys liberationist urges had only popular enthusiasm to back them: where a new crop of national leaders sought to be more than understudies to the great powers of the day. For India, the Russian Revolution was more than communism. It deeply marked the countrys coming of age.

58f4d5d060de470aa339c91f,Rural election pot boils across state,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170215/jsp/odisha/story_135772.jsp,2017-02-15,"Film actors campaign for Independent candidate Prashant Mohanty at Govindpur gram panchayat in Cuttack district on Tuesday. Telegraph picture Balipada, Feb. 14: The small weekly village haat in Govindpur gram panchayat of Kantapada block in Cuttack district was buzzing with excitement today when Odia film stars reached here to campaign for Independent candidate Prashant Mohanty aka Jhallia Bhai for the panchayat poll. While the BJD has roped in all the big names among film stars for campaigning, those who have not joined the BJD today chose to campaign here for Independent candidates. The election to the gram panchayat will be held on February 17. As soon as the film stars reached the haat, people from all corners of Govindpur village - which has traditionally been considered a BJD bastion - flocked to the weekly market to catch a glimpse of them. The small-time traders of the haat also rushed to hear what all the film stars had to say, leaving their work behind. Film stars Amulya Patnaik, Debidatta Barik, Leena and Sabita, visited the Govindpur haat today. Asked why they had joined the campaign, Debidatta Barik said: ""We film stars are part of society. We joined the campaign to tell people that they should elect the right candidates. We are campaigning here for Jhallia Bhai whose son is a major in the Indian Army and is busy protecting our motherland. It is our duty to support him. We are not taking any money for this."" As soon as Barik completed his speech, the villagers rushed to shake hands with the actors. ""We have watched them in various films and serials. We are happy to see them in person here,"" said Bachhana Mallick. Even though the sarpanch seats are not contested on the party lines, people have a fair idea about the candidates whom the major parties are backing. The BJP, which has not been able to make substantial inroads in the coastal belt yet, is now slowly gaining ground. BJP flags were noticed in many villages in Govindpur and other parts of Niali Assembly constituency. While there is a fair chance that many Independent candidates will do well in the sarpanch election, the BJD is going to face a tough fight from the BJP for the first time in the zilla parishad elections. The Congress is also making all-out efforts to make its presence felt in the state. ""We will not reveal who we are going to vote for. We will follow certain criteria in selecting the candidates. For the sarpanch, we will elect a candidate who is honest and can do something good for the villages. But for the zilla parishad, we will pick the party candidates. However, I cannot reveal who I am going to vote for,"" said tomato seller Bhibhu Das. As soon as the road show ended at Govindpur, the film stars moved to another village. ""It is really a good experience to be part of the panchayat poll campaign. My suggestion to people is that they should exercise their voting rights and take part in the election process,"" said one actor."

The elephant was part of a small migratory herd from the North Cauvery Wild Life Sanctuary that stretches from Karnataka to Tamil Nadu.The accused, whose identity was not known, were from the same village and had allegedly indulged in wild boar hunting in Ulipandaa in the past. Hunting of wild boars is an offence in Tamil Nadu, though the Central government had declared the species to be vermin in a few States.On Monday night, the accused A.Basavaraj (34), son of Anumadhappa, and his friend T.Madesh, son of Thimmarayappa, were reportedly waiting in a tomato field. Basavaraj had taken the land adjoining the tomato field on lease for cultivation.The duo and three other men were waiting for the wild boar, when they spotted the elephant grazing afar. Basavaraj allegedly used his country-made gun to shoot down the elephant.On Tuesday morning, a team consisting of officials from the Forest Department, including Conservator of Forests, Dharmapuri, Ashish Kumar Srivastava, District Forest officer, Hosur, Rajendran, along with Hosur Sub Collector Senthil Raju, accompanied by the police reached Ulipanda on receiving the alert from locals.The Forest Department has booked the men under Section 9, 39 and 51 of Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, and under Section 25(1)(A) of the Indian Arms Act 1959; and under Section 9 B (1) (b) Indian Explosive Substance Act , 1908.The police arrested Madesh and picked up two others in the village, while the prime accused, Basavaraj, is not traceable.Firing unprovokedMr. Srivastava told The Hindu that the accused could not have shot the elephant in self-defence as there were no signs of aggression.A Revenue Department official similarly, said the the accused had taken time to aim at the head of the elephant that was grazing at a distance.A parallel report will be submitted by the Revenue Department to the government.The three-tonne elephant could not be shifted along the difficult unmotorable terrain of the village. Hence, an autopsy was carried on the spot and was buried at the same spot.Quite a few instances of shooting with illegal country-made guns in Thally and Denkanikottai area have been reported over personal enmity."

Prakash Kammardi. This situation has arisen as there is a bountiful harvest of various crops because of good rains in other States as well as countries. Either the cheap crops from other States are entering our markets or there is no demand for our produce in other markets because of glut in their own areas, he said.It is like rubbing salt into the wound of farmers who have already suffered crop losses owing to serious drought or floods as they may have to not only suffer reduction in yield, but also crash in the prices, notes the The Perspective and Forecasting report by the KAPC.According to the commissions report, what has complicated the matter is the impact of demonetisation. This has prevented the recovery of prices of some crops besides leading to a dip in the price of others owing to poor cash flow in the markets, Dr. Kammardi said.The commissions report has pointed out that the prices of tomato and onion have crashed by 84 per cent and 70 per cent respectively, when compared with the earlier level; and that of copra and arecanut have seen a dip of 47 per cent and 7 per cent respectively after demonetisation.The commission has suggested to the State government to take up the issue with NABARD as well as the Union government to increase the daily money withdrawal limit for farm traders in agricultural produce marketing committees (APMC) in the interest of farmers.Pointing out that the norms related to monetary withdrawal limits from banks were relaxed for tea growers of some areas, Dr. Kammardi sought similar benefit to be extended to APMCs as nearly 41 per cent of the trading of farm produce takes place in these markets.This is one of the worst harvest seasons for farmers in terms of prices in the last several decades. This has resulted owing to glut in production in other States/countries coupled with the impact of demonetisation.T.N. Prakash Kammaradi, Chairman, Karnataka Agriculture Price Commission"
58f4f1607be9e0185109fe04,Tomato trade feels currency squeeze,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170130/jsp/bengal/story_133058.jsp,2017-01-30,"Purulia, Jan. 29: Thousands of tomato growers in Purulia and Bankura have been hit hard by the absence of buyers of the fruit-vegetable, a not-so-indispensable item in this season of demonetisation. A tomato vendor waits for customers at Urma in Purulia. Picture by Mita Roy Farmer Balaram Kisku, who has cultivated around 100 quintals of tomato in Purulia in November-December, has been feeding a part of his produce to cattle instead of letting it rot in the fields. Agriculture department officials said the demand for tomato was all the more hit because people in eastern India can do without the fruit-vegetable in the kitchen, unlike potato or onion. According to the officials, around 1,000 tomato farmers had been hit in Purulia and Bankura. ""I sold tomato at Rs 20 a kg between October and November. The demand started falling in the middle of November and with it, the price too came down. The situation has come to such a pass that I am being forced to sell a bucket of tomato (around 20-22kg) for only Rs 10 to the wholesalers,"" said Kisku, a resident of Hatinada village on the Ayodhya hills. The vegetable trade has been hit hard in rural Bengal, where wholesalers depend on cash and digital transactions are still a hard nut to crack. ""The cash crunch has left vegetable farmers in serious trouble. The situation is worse for tomato growers because people can do without tomato for days. If people have cash, they would rather spend on potato than tomato,"" an agriculture department official said. In Purulia and Bankura, farmers usually grow tomato between October and March. Officials said the dry climate in the two districts and the hilly terrain are conducive to growing tomato. In the last season, about 3,000 tonnes of tomato had been supplied to various parts of the country from Purulia and Bankura. But this time, the demand has plunged several notches. Ramesh Pandit, a Dhanbad-based tomato wholesaler who owns a warehouse in Purulia's Balarampur, said around 150 quintals of the fruit-vegetable were lying unsold with him. Sources in the agriculture department said a good production this time had added to the trouble of tomato wholesalers in Bengal, which has very few multipurpose cold storage and processing units."
