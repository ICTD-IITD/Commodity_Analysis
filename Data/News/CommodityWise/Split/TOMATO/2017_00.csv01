But as the week proceeded, and the alliance talks got stuck, jubilation turned into despondency  especially among Muslims, the community that has driven this alliance more than any other.In Bareilly, barely 24 hours before the SP-Congress alliance was officially announced on Sunday, a young Muslim journalist who writes for local Urdu papers, said: When Akhilesh got the cycle, there was great excitement; today, there is a sense of hopelessness in the community. The alliance must happen.In western U.P.s 125 Assembly constituencies, the Muslims are the single largest bloc, roughly 38 per cent of the population (across the State, it is 18 per cent).For Muslims, the Modi government has heightened its sense of insecurity, with the free run it has given RSS outfits to run campaigns targeted against them  from love jihad and ghar wapsi to cow protection vigilantism. There is a determination, therefore, in the community to use its numbers to influence next months poll results.Community divisionsClass, educational backgrounds and even caste may divide the community, but an overwhelming majority is rooting for Akhilesh Yadav and a SP-Congress alliance, from lawyers in Muzaffarnagar, to madrasa students in Bareilly, to businessmen and artisans alike in Moradabad, to tomato farmers in Sambhal.Their reasons vary: if students and young farmers see Akhilesh bhaiyya as emblematic of their aspirations, Urdu scholar Murtaza Iqbal in Moradabad says, The SP is the flip side of the BJP, with its politics also helping to polarise votes. But Akhilesh, unlike his father Mulayam Singh, is seen as non-partisan. And if the Congress joins the alliance, it will have a moderating influence on the SP.For the SP-Congress alliance, there is, of course, one major obstacle, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), that has a major advantage in western UP  the Jataav vote that is about 14 per cent in this belt and which is going to turn out in full strength for it.In addition, with the most backward castes having largely deserted her, BSP supremo Mayawati has been promoting the idea of a Dalit-Muslim alliance in this election. She has given 97 seats to members of the community, with 36 from this region of the State.This poses a challenge to the SP, for whom the Muslims are the base vote in western UP. But as I travelled through the districts of Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Saharanpur, Bijnor, Moradabad, Bareilly and Badayun, it was clear Muslims will only vote for the BSP when they find the SP-Congress candidate cannot defeat the BJP.Of course, there are instances such as in the Swar constituency, where SP strongman Azam Khans rookie son Abdullah is pitted against the BSPs Kazim Ali Khan, the Nawab of Rampur: the Muslim votes could get divided here.As for the Congress, its eight per cent votes will come in handy for the SP, as it is likely to chip away at the BJPs upper caste votes.People are not prepared to give it a starring role in Battleground UP, but feel it will play a competent supporting role.As a young government in Badayun said, We want a milijuli sarkar (a coalition government); enough of these Hitlers."

""Financial terrorism has been inflicted on this country through demonetisation. I will be filing a PIL against the Prime Minister as to why criminal procedures not be initiated against the PM for crippling the rural economy,"" Raina said, adding he was consulting his lawyers. Raina, the president of the Haryana Agro Forestry Farmers' Association, said the note ban had crippled the wood industry in the BJP-ruled state and resulted in huge lay-offs. He claimed the industry had to shut down for a month after demonetisation while potato, tomato and fruit growers were hit so hard that they had been forced to sell their produce below cost. Raina, who hails from Kurukshetra, claimed he had been an active member of the BJP since 2006 and was working with the Muslim Rashtriya Manch, led by RSS leader Indresh Kumar. The Manch describes itself as an association of ""nationalist Muslims and functionaries of the RSS"". BJP leaders claimed they did not know Raina and declined comment on his assertions. ""Anybody can claim he is a BJP member. How can one react to somebody's claim?"" said a BJP national secretary, refusing to be quoted on record. Kumar, the Manch leader, could not be contacted. Raina, however, said he was a ""responsible citizen"" and came from an ex-servicemen family where many had won bravery awards. He claimed many in the BJP and the RSS felt demonetisation had wrecked the nation's economy but were not speaking out because of personal reasons. Raina said he had written a letter to the Prime Minister and sought his resignation, allegedly over deaths caused by the note ban. He repeated the demand today and called upon the BJP to elect a new leader. ""All over India, the situation is catastrophic and frightening due to demonetisation...The Prime Minister has to take the onus of these deaths and step down with immediate effect. Let the BJP members of the Lok Sabha take a decision to elect another Prime Minister,"" Raina has said in the letter. A copy has been sent to L.K. Advani, among the BJP veterans consigned to a margdarshak mandal (advisory panel) in the BJP."

Wholesale traders recall that only 3,000 shops were planned initially when the wholesale market was set up in 1996. However, nearly 600 more shops were built during the two decades.Following the proposal to convert the vacant space near vegetable retail market, members of the Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants Association said the plan to allot 29 shops near gate number 5 must be stopped.M. Thyagarajan, a wholesale tomato merchant, said it was being used a as a space to load produce by retail merchants and also by customers who visit retail market.Aggravates congestionMembers said if additional shops are constructed, traders might be forced to share the space. This would aggravate congestion as more vehicles would visit the area. The space could be instead used to set up eateries, a post office or an ATM for the huge number of visitors.P. Sukumar, the association joint secretary, said nearly 1,000 vehicles visit the market daily. We have been demanding that the market management committee make arrangements to regulate traffic, particularly during early morning hours as the market is busy from midnight to 4 a.m. Also, we receive produce and distribute it to areas in a radius of 200 km from the city, he said.More shops would only add to the woes of congestion at the market, which is already encroached, traders said. They also complained about erratic garbage clearance.They plan to go on an indefinite strike after holding talks about various traders association if their long pending demands to improve the market are no met.Sources in the Market Management Committee said that measures would be taken to on the demands of the traders after a meeting with them."

NDDB chairman Dilip Rath told the media this evening that the unit was being set up by Mother Dairy Fruits and Vegetables, a wholly owned subsidiary of NDDB, at an expenditure of Rs 82.77 crore. ""It is being set up in two phases. The first phase comprising an IQF (individual quick freezers) freezing line with an annual capacity of 5,650 tonne will be commissioned tomorrow,"" he said. Products of this facility will be marketed under Safal, the brand used by Mother Dairy. Mother Dairy managing director S. Nagarajan, who was also present at the briefing, said civil construction of the second phase comprising a pulp processing unit of 17,700 tonne capacity was also nearly complete. It would be commissioned by the end of the year. In the first phase, freezing of vegetables, particularly green peas, would be taken up, while in the second phase, processing of tomatoes would be done. ""But quality of tomatoes available locally is not of processing variety. Hence, its quality needs to be upgraded,"" Nagarajan said, adding they had already engaged their procurement team for motivating farmers to use high quality seeds for getting the desired yield. ""The turnover of the facility in its full capacity is pegged at Rs 150 crore with around 45 per cent likely to be transferred to farmers,"" NDDB chairman Rath said, adding that the unit would also spur massive direct and indirect employment in ancillary services like supply chain, logistics and transportation. NDDB got the clearance from the state government in December 2015 for setting up the fruit and vegetable processing plant on a plot measuring about 27 acres in Nagri. Besides retail sale of vegetables, it also plans to prepare sauce and pulp concentrates using fruits such as banana, guava, mango, papaya and litchi. Jharkhand is among the six largest green peas and tomato producing states. NDDB chose Jharkhand for its ecology, considered ideal for horticulture landscaping. Besides, the use of pesticides is also less in Jharkhand compared to other states north India."

Telegraph picture Ranchi, March 7: Chief Minister Raghubar Das today inaugurated a food and vegetable processing unit set up by National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) in Nagri block, dedicating it to farmers of the state and hoping that the first-of-its-kind plant in Jharkhand speeds up rural economy and creates jobs. Set up by Mother Dairy Fruits and Vegetables, a wholly-owned NDDB subsidiary, at a cost of Rs 82.77 crore, the plant has come up on a 27-acre plot 40km from the capital. Processed products would be sold under the well-known Mother Dairy brand Safal. Union minister of state for agriculture and Lohardaga MP Sudarshan Bhagat, state agriculture minister Randhir Kumar Singh, NDDB chairman Dilip Rath, chief secretary Rajbala Verma and Nagri farmers were also present. In his address, the chief minister said this plant was in line with their mission to make Jharkhand self-sufficient in the agro sector. In the coming days more such units would be set up. ""This plant won't just directly procure fruits and vegetables locally to process them and sell within and outside the state, but will also generate lots of employment,"" he said to a crowd of around 500. ""Around 70 per cent of total jobs generated by the plant will get jobs immediately when the first phase of the plant starts now. When the second phase is ready for launch and operations by this year-end, more jobs will get created,"" he added but did not specify how many direct and indirect jobs would be generated. Asked for an idea of the kind of numbers they were looking at, B.S.

Set up in two phases, the first phase of the plant comprises an IQF (individual quick freezer) with an annual capacity of 5,650 tonne which will start immediately while the second will have a pulp processing unit of 17,700 tonne annual capacity, civil works for which are also underway. In the first phase, freezing of vegetables, particularly green peas, would be the focus. The second phase would be geared mainly around tomato processing. The total annual turnover of the plant in its full capacity is pegged at Rs 150 crore with around 45 per cent likely to be transferred to farmers,said state agriculture department officials. The chief minister maintained that the government was working out plans to make farmers adapt progressive and organic farming. ""We have signed a few MoUs for skill-building centres in agriculture sector during the Global Investors' Summit which will soon see the light of day,"" he said. Advising farmers to take up flower cultivation, Das said if the floriculture sector started blooming, the government would start planning units to convert flowers into various end products. ""We earmarked Rs 700 crore in 2017-18 budget only for skill mission and there is lot of potential in agriculture and animal husbandry,"" he said.

58f50a057be9e018510a210a,Making electric sense,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170108/jsp/opinion/story_129076.jsp,2017-01-08,"When young students first start to study art history they often make the elementary mistake of putting different movements and artists into quite rigid chronologies, forgetting that people and events in history - like colour on a canvas - often bleed and dribble into each other. For a long time there was a certain accepted progression that mid-20th-century Western art followed: before the Second World War there were the Europeans who were important, Picasso, Matisse, Klee and the Surrealists, followed by the shift of power from Paris to New York, when Abstract Expressionism was arrived at and the great Abs Ex painters exploded across the art firmament; then, counter to the Abs Ex gang came the Pop Art wallas, Rauschenberg, Johns, Warhol, followed by a whole host of others, themselves followed by the various art movements of the 1960s and then the 1970s and so on, forming a neat and orderly graph. Convenient as this was, to put on a timeline in a book, reality was somewhat different. Kandinsky and Rodchenko, and then Klee, and then the Bauhaus crew, and the soon overlapping Georgia O'Keeffe had all pushed the envelope of non-representational painting well before the 1940s. Marcel Duchamp and the Dadaists had already challenged the gallery-oriented, market-oriented narrative of the 'maestro' and 'masterpiece' with great verve and humour, Man Ray had exploded (among many other things) the fetish of the 'painterly hand', well before Pop Art spilled out from a quickly cut open can of Campbell's tomato soup. Abs Ex may have gained traction only after WW2, but people such as Arshile Gorky and Josef Albers were already pushing the next generation of young painters into jettisoning cubist distortions of actual organic and inorganic forms and going for 'pure' abstraction, for undiluted mark-making. Even as the New York art establishment began to recognize and champion Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Willem De Kooning and others, already an only slightly younger generation was starting to tug at the carpet under the feet of the Abs Ex painters. By the early 1950s, Rauschenberg was hanging out with composer John Cage and his partner, choreographer Merce Cunningham, at Black Mountain College in North Dakota and opening up his mind in ways that were very different from what the Abs Ex people were thinking. By the mid-1950s, several different pots of artwork, some of them highly 'experimental', were bubbling in different dilapidated kitchens across America and a western Europe still licking its wounds from the ravages of the war. While the Abs Ex painters were in full flow, so were the duo of Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, later joined by Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, James Rosenquist and Claes Oldenburg, all of whom loosely formed what is labelled American Pop Art. In West Germany, Joseph Beuys and associated artists had already begun to change the game with the first Documenta show at Kassel. People who would do huge public works such as Christo, massive earthworks in landscape like Robert Smithson, and the single parent of video art, Nam June Paik, were all about to start their dialogue with the (then largely Western) public. I could have seen the big Abstract Expressionist retrospective at the Royal Academy at several points over last autumn but, as luck would have it, I managed to make it on one of the last days of the show, with a trip to Tate Modern to catch the newly opened retrospective of Robert Rauschenberg just a few days later. To be able to immediately compare and contrast these two connected but opposed bodies of work was a piece of great good fortune. The show at the RA repeatedly reminds us that it is the first big UK retro of the Abs Ex painters since 1959. This fact is startling and it leads to a bifurcating conclusion, one that eats its own tail, so to speak. On the one hand, it speaks of ubiquitousness of Abs Ex as the canonical narrative of post-war art internationally, the grand scale, the primacy of colour, the heroic (usually male) painter making these feverish or highly meditative marks, leaving layered pigment spoors of his body on the canvas, this 'model' that has been the most copied by artists outside the Western world over the last 60-odd years; in other words, who needs to see another Pollock, Rothko or De Kooning when they are so present everywhere and when there are so many sub-abstractionists about? On the other hand, it also speaks of the insularity of the UK art establishment, an insularity that (till the early 90s at least) is not uncoupled with an inferiority complex vis--vis the brash, loud, indefatigably inventive art cousins from across the pond; that is, why should we big up this dated form of picture-making when we have so many great artists of our own, doing everything from modern figurative to abstraction to Pop to dodgy suspended sharks and soiled beds? Whatever the logic for the 57-year-long ignore, the RA show makes some amends with its size and spread. It's a great pleasure to be confronting Pollock's manic splatter, entire canvases, rectangular islands encrusted as if by deliberate coloured bird-droppings from very intelligent avian beings, to be immersed in the chroma- dhrupad of Rothko, to let the eyes be led a dance again by the starkly beautiful black and white slashes and whorls of Franz Kline and Robert Motherwell. The curators of the show make the case that these painters were painting at a time of great anxiety for the human race, when the Cold War and the various mid-century upheavals held us hostage from many different directions, and that a great humanist vision actually comes through the most controlled Ad Reinhardt as it does in the craziest Willem De Kooning. I love this work, but I'm far from sure about this argument. Whatever its beginnings, after a while Abs Ex provided yet another closed club, yet another notional, canonical top table, with all the suspect money and power of the millionaire collectors attached. Sure, most of the brilliant painters in this show retain a sense of play, and of great meditative gravitas, but ultimately they could not stop Abstract Expressionism from becoming what it did - a fetishistic commodity art divorced from the reality around it. For the connection to the real, to the immediate, to the thorny, barbed wired daily experience of mid-20th century America, for the belly laughs and a very different meditation you have to go to Robert Rauschenberg. The eye, the sheer joy and intelligence of this man, one of the greatest artists (and not just of the 20th century), is hard even to outline in the space available here. But let me just recount one thing that struck me when I first discovered Rauschenberg as a young art student in late 1970s America, that of all these mostly white and mostly male painters who made up the American Art All-stars of the 50s, 60s, 70s and the 80s, RR was the one who seemed to have internalized the chaos and craziness of street Calcutta without ever having been there. The trousers stuck to the canvas and painted over, the goat with a tyre around its middle, the combine painting Bed, splattered with paint and gestures brazenly hijacked from the Abs Ex guys yet taken to another level with the iconic pillow and the quilt, the controlled pictorial noise of the big silk screen 'collages' all, still, make electric sense in today's world, and light up connections across widely different cultures. There is the poetry of chance married to rigorous looking, great hedonism of material leavened by monkish self-denial of any self-indulgence. Looking at contemporary art, Indian or otherwise, I'm often struck by what I call 'strategic visual amnesia'. The works presented often make no acknowledgment of their debt to what has gone before: it's as if people like Claes Oldenburg or Cindy Sherman - to mention just two artists - had never existed, never produced any work. Looking at Rauscehnberg's huge range, from the all black canvases of the early 1950s to the gossamer constructions of the Hoarfrost series, the spiky combines, the hypnotic silk screen blow-ups, the performance and video art, the textile based work made in Ahmedabad in the mid-1970s, you realize here is someone who is at once so open and generous about the debts he owes his predecessors and yet such is his discipline and inventiveness that so many people who've followed him will have no choice but to acknowledge how much he opened their eyes, hearts and minds. As I leave the Rauschenberg show, I get word on my mobile that John Berger has died at the age of 90. A friend who loves Berger's writing sends me this line which makes so much sense in the context of both the shows I have just seen: ""The function of the work of art,"" Berger sums up (Max) Raphael, ""is to lead us from the work to the process of creation which it contains."""

The traders of Salem, Namakkal, Villupuram, and Cuddalore districts participate in the auction. With the production of tomatoes going down in the Vazhappadi and Kalvarayan hill villages due to severe drought conditions prevailing in the district, there is considerable reduction in the arrival of the same in the daily market.In contrary, tomato production is on the increase in the neighbouring States and the traders from the western districts procure the same and market them through the daily market.Due to this, the price of the local tomato variety has come down in the last few days. At present, the 25 kg to 28 kg tomato box is priced at Rs. 500 and the 10 kg box at Rs. 250.

Dry weather and drought conditions in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka were also cited to be another reason for the steady increase in the cost of some vegetables.P.Sukumar, joint secretary, Koyambedu Fruits, Flowers and Vegetables Market, said on Monday, some vegetables, including cabbage, carrot, beans and broad beans were costlier by 25% than last week due to short supply. Vegetables such as brinjal and carrot were priced between Rs. 30-Rs. 40 a kg. The prices doubled in the initial two days of the strike as residents bought more to stock owing to strike. However, prices of onion, tomato and potato remain stable. They are sold at less than Rs. 25 a kg in wholesale market as most of the stock is procured from Maharashtra and other parts of north India. Meanwhile, about 200 traders participated in a demonstration in support of the farmers demands for loan waiver and drought relief fund."

But supplies are falling even from this centuries-old Arabian sea route that is one of the last lifelines to a country on the brink of famine.A two-year-old civil war has severely restricted the flow of food into the main Yemeni cargo ports of Hodeidah and Salif on the Red Sea, where all the large grain silos are located.The small wooden boats sailing from souks in the UAE are moving small but vital supplies by making for the smaller ports to the south coast that are of little use to larger vessels - and often sidestepping military inspections that choke traffic by dropping anchor at secluded coves nearby.The deals originate in the sprawling Al Ras Market, a collection of dusty alleyways near the Dubai Creek where an array of food and spices are on display including colourful sacks of Pakistani and Indian rice.The dhows - plying the ancient trade route that once carried the likes of pearls, frankincense and myrrh - supply 14,000 to 18,000 tonnes of foodstuffs a month to Yemen, according to traders. That represents a drop of about 30-40 percent over the past year because of problems with payment, as well as adverse sailing conditions.""The Yemeni currency is destroyed, sometimes we can't get paid enough. We can only go once a month because the seas are too rough,"" said trader Mohammed Hassan, at a docking station at nearby Port Khaled in Sharjah""Sometimes we have to wait 40 days.""The volumes of food carried on this route represent a small fraction of the supply to Yemen, which relies on imports for 90 percent of its food. But it has become increasingly important as fighting has raged, the economy has collapsed and Yemen has needed all the help it can get.PORT DAMAGEThousands of people have been killed in the civil war pits the Iran-allied Houthi group against a Saudi-backed coalition - which includes the UAE - fighting to restore the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.The conflict has choked imports. Sixty percent of Yemenis, or 17 million people, are in ""crisis"" or ""emergency"" food situations, according to the United Nations.While vessels seeking access to Houthi-held areas must face inspections for smuggled weapons, the government-controlled south has less restrictions.Food imports into Hodeidah have fallen relentlessly, with only a few ships arriving each week - compared with dozens before the war - and more shipping lines pulling out due to the growing risks, according to aid and shipping sources.In recent weeks damage to infrastructure in the neighbouring port of Salif has also cut food deliveries, aid officials said.""The country is living on its reserves,"" said Robert Mardini, International Committee of the Red Cross regional director for the Near and Middle East in Geneva this week.""There is a lack of liquidity, no payment of salaries, which means that the spending power has collapsed and that the price of food is soaring whenever it is available.""'PAY THUGS'UAE-based dhow captains avoid these snarl-ups by steering clear of the big Red Sea ports and instead ply their trade to the south, often docking at informal inlets.The average journey takes about five to eight days, with the boats capable of taking up to 2,000 tonnes of goods, still small fry compared with cargo ships that could provide more relief to one of the poorest and most unstable countries in the world.Trader Ali Mahdani ships his goods out of Dubai to the southern Yemeni ports of Aden, Mukalla or Mokha, goods worth 4-6 million UAE dirhams ($1.1-1.6 million) per month, around 2,000 tonnes of mostly rice, spices or cooking oil. To avoid payments in the battered Yemeni currency he gets paid in Saudi riyals.There are few issues upon arrival. That's a sharp contrast the scrutiny that any vessels hoping to access the north would be subjected to as the Saudi-led coalition search for weapons which may be headed into Houthi hands.""You may have to pay thugs every once in a while but otherwise it is all good to go,"" said Mahdani, dressed in a flowing white robe.Trader Amin Baghersh ships powered milk, tomato paste, sugar and rice from Al Ras to Yemen, selling about one million UAE dirhams worth per month.He and others rely on hawala, an informal trading system through exchange houses based on trust and personal ties.Most of his goods make their way to Mukalla and Aden and surrounding areas. But he, like others, has taken a heavy hit from the Yemeni currency crisis and payment problems caused by the war.An Iranian trader had similar complaints.""I used to transfer about 2,000 tonnes of food a month,"" said the trader, who declined to give his name. ""In the last three or four months people asked me for supplies but I am reluctant to deal with them.""($1 = 3.6724 UAE dirham)(Additional reporting by Jonathan Saul in London and Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva; Editing by Pravin Char)"
