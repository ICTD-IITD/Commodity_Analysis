And Food Safety and Standards Authority of India certified ones at that, with manufactured, expiry and best before dates stamped on every serving.It isn't just the menu that's modern at the Jaya Durga Peetham , the service is too. Here, you will find visitors slipping token into vending machines to collect boxes of their 'pret-a-prasadam', prepared with precision in the automated temple kitchen.K Sri Sridhar, a herbal oncologist who helped set up the temple, says his idea to serve up desserts and sandwiches as part of the temple prasadam has rustled up quite a bit of interest among locals and tourists. ""The idea was to show that anything that is nutritious and prepared in a clean kitchen with a clean mind can be served to God. It doesn't have to be only traditional dishes,"" says Sridhar.A few months ago, the temple even introduced the 'birthday cake prasadam' for its devotees. ""We maintain a computerised register of their birth dates and addresses and door deliver a cake prasadam to them. It's a hit among the elderly devotees, because coming from the temple it adds a special touch to the occasion,"" says Sridhar.On Saturday, for instance, 81-year-old Subbulakshmi was more than pleasantly surprised when she received a cake prasadam. ""It was so pretty with flowers and icing,"" says the 81-year-old, adding it was her first surprise cake ever. ""And it came with an agar deepam (a traditional oil lamp) instead of candles which was so nice. Just like they light at the temple,"" she adds. ""When we set up the temple we thought we should give Gods the food we relish,"" he says. Guess nothing says that better than a butterscotch mousse."

In a statement in the assembly, Maharathy said favourable weather conditions had helped tomato production in the district to go up, resulting in a fall in prices. Quoting the wholesale price index, he said nationally the price of vegetables was lower than that of last year.The minister, however, was silent on setting up of infrastructure, particularly cold storages, a factor widely seen responsible for the distress sale of vegetables across the state. Official sources said Keonjhar has only one cold storage facility with a capacity of 5,000 tonne.Maharathy said Keonjhar district collector N Thirumala Naik visited certain tomato growing villages and initiated discussion on setting up of a committee through which farmers could sell vegetables directly to retailers. The minister claimed he has also instructed authorities of the integrated tribal development agency (ITDA) to ensure purchase of tomatoes directly from the growers for residential schools. ""Due to the intervention of the administration, local traders have been buying tomatoes directly from farmers since March 3 at Rs 120 per crate,"" he said.The farmers' wing of the BJP, which organised a massive protest here during the day, was far from impressed with the minister's statement. BJP Krushak Morcha president Sibaji Mohanty said the government has been regularly dishing out false promises."

Farmers hurled the tomato harvest to the ground, demanding access to cold storage facilities and compensation for losses.Later, they submitted a memorandum to the additional district magistrate, Sangram Keshari Swain . ""We have received their demand letter and have asked the horticulture department for an inquiry. We will take necessary steps after we get the report,"" said Swain.Farmers alleged that they have been unable to sell their produce and have not been able to store them either, without cold storage facilities. Most of them had taken loans from different banks and SHG groups and have not been able to repay them, as a result. ""While earlier, traders from Sambalpur, Rourkela and Khurdha procured tomatoes to avoid distress sales by farmers, after the intervention of district administration, this year no agencies have done that,"" said farmer, Debabrata Mohanta.While the rate of tomatoes per 30 kilograms is about Rs 30, the plucking wage is about Rs 10 per 30 kilos. ""Hence, we could not engage labour to pluck the tomatoes as there is no market to sale. Tomato on acres of land is gradually rotting,"" Debabrata said.Processing units like Bilati Orissa Limited used to procure the major bulk of tomatoes earlier for production of sauce. Problems started after the closure of the firm.Worst affected are farmers from villages like Mahadeijoda, Tikarpada, Salarapenth, Naupada and Dalimapur, which cater to the district's vegetable market.""If the tomatoes could be stored now then they could be saved and after about one month, we could get their value. But there is no cold storage here to store vegetables and other products,"" said farmer Sarat Mohanta of Mahadeijoda.""We are making an investigation on the quantities of production and the causes of distress sale. Due to favourable climate all over the state, no one has been coming to these villages to buy tomatoes,"" said the Keonjhar deputy director of horticulture, Ranjan Kumar Das Mohapatra . ""Farmers can process the tomatoes by setting up a small scale processing unit with an investment of Rs 2 lakh. We can provide technical support if they need. They can preserve the extract of tomatoes for weeks this way,"" Mohapatra added."

As local harvest of vegetables including tomatoes, chilli, lemon, coriander and bottle gourd is likely to go down, prices are likely to shoot up. Prices of vegetables are all time cheap since January due to extremely good local harvest. However, wholesale traders are expecting scarcity of vegetables as local harvest gets exhausted from March.Presently, homemakers are enjoying vegetable shopping as prices remained cheaper in January and February. Tomatoes in wholesale are priced at Rs 5 to Rs 10 per kg where as it is selling at Rs 10 to Rs 15 per kg in retail market. Onion, which usually brings tears in eyes of the common man, is sold in Rs 10 to Rs 15 per kg in the wholesale while its retail market value is Rs 15 to Rs 20 per kg.""From mid-March when local harvest of these crops would be finished, there is going to be trouble. From this period, we would be dependent on Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh for vegetables and thus supply would be less which will add to the price rise. We are expecting a rise of 15 percent to 25 percent in vegetable price from mid-March,"" said Abdul Aziz, a wholesale dealer of fruits and vegetables at Mohana Mandi which supplies major chunk of vegetables in the city.According to sources, traders are also into hoarding of onions, potatoes and ginger sensing the upcoming scarcity.""We got bumper crop this time from Bassi, Kanota, Chommu, Chandwaji, Dudu and other nearby villages due to which the prices of vegetables were cheaper compared to last three years.

Ganesh , 38, one of the farmers at Periya Muthaali village where the wall broke, said, ""The side wall of the canal of Kelavarapalli dam had broken many a times. This time, the range of loss is high as the floodwater submerged around 100 acres of fertile land,"" he said.Another farmer S Manjunath , 34, said farmers have faced huge loss due to negligence on the part of public works department (PWD).

The health benefit of preparing food in earthen pots was known to our ancestors, and has been an intrinsic part of the Indian kitchen. However, the tradition vanished with the arrival of steel and aluminum vessels.The canteen, in business for about 15 years now, started using earthen pot only four months ago. They serve palav for Rs 40, which includes more leafy green vegetables and rice. Healthy seeds, dry fruits, ghee, pickle and curd give the food an original taste. ""We use 35 healthy ingredients in the palav. People who are health conscious come here for their meal,"" said Narayan, the cook at the canteen.Ganesh, a customer, said, ""I have food here every day. From my experience, I bet no expensive food matches the health benefits available here. Many people think that paying more gives you healthier food, it's not so. We should prepare such food at home too, and include rural medicinal plants which are ignored.""On the health benefit of clay pots, Dr Chandra Shekhar Aithal from Udupi said, ""Clay has a porous quality. While cooking, heat and moisture circulate through the pot, unlike in metal or enamel-lined pots. Most pots are made with micaceous clay (clay containing mica flecks), which acts as a natural insulator. The speciality of these pots is that the clay is alkaline based, hence it interacts with acidity in the food, neutralizing the pH balance. Cooking in clay pots gives you calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, sulphur and several other compounds that benefit our body. It has the power to control diabetes and blood pressure.""The original Udupi fish curry is prepared in clay pots in villages. Shankari, 67, from Nellikatte, Udupi, said this fish curry can be had for three days without it spoiling. In fact, as it matures, the taste improves, and it just needs to be heated every day.""Making rice in clay pots is difficult because it should be handled with care, but curry can be made easily. I love dishes prepared in pots. These pots are naturally very acidic; hence when we cook tomato in it, it gets a natural sweetness,"" said Shankari."
