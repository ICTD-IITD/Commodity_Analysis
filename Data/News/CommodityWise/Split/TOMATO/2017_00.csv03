Taking the tourism buzz many notches higher, AP Tourism Development Corporation is now promoting Brand Vizag with a series of events and initiatives starting with the much-awaited Visakha Utsav from February 3 to 5.A brand new logo designed by AP Tourism Director Himanshu Shukla was unveiled at the summit. The whole idea is to promote each and every region of AP with a distinct identity such as having different branding strategies for Vizag and Amaravati. For that, we are trying to decentralise the tourism departments for the ease of administration and for easy allocation of funds. As part of this initiative, we will be recruiting a team of youngsters for the Vizag tourism office under the Regional Tourist Information Bureau who will conceptualise and implement bi-monthly cultural festivals in Visakhapatnam, head of the Regional Information Bureau K. Gnanaveni told The Hindu .As part of the branding strategy for Vizag, 3,000 college students will be sporting t-shirts with the new logo and participating in a walkathon from YMCA to Kali Temple on February 3 ahead of the inaugural function of Visakha Utsav. The walkathon will culminate in a formation reflecting the word Vizag at the venue opposite Kali Temple.Cultural festivalsThis apart, the Tourism Department is planning to host theme-based cultural festivals such as kite festival, rangoli festival, tomato festival (based on Tomatina festival of Spain) every month starting from this summer. Every alternate weekend of the month, we will host a classical and western music festival alternately. The venue for the classical festival will be Kailasagiri and will highlight the classical music traditions of our country along with craft stalls and Indian cuisine counters. The Beach Road will be the venue for the western music festival which will see a confluence of DJs and showcase world cuisine at the food stalls, Ms. Ganaveni said."

Wholesale traders noted that the market received only 220 truckloads of vegetables against its daily share of 300 lorries on Monday. This had led to short supply of vegetables such as carrot, brinjal, beans and beetroot.Lorries mainly from southern parts of the State refrained from transporting goods even though the Tamil Nadu State Lorry Owners Federation had announced that essential goods supply would not be affected. Dry weather and drought conditions in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka were also cited to be another reason for the steady increase in the cost of some vegetables.P.Sukumar, joint secretary, Koyambedu Fruits, Flowers and Vegetables Market, said on Monday, some vegetables, including cabbage, carrot, beans and broad beans were costlier by 25% than last week due to short supply. Vegetables such as brinjal and carrot were priced between Rs. 30-Rs. 40 a kg. The prices doubled in the initial two days of the strike as residents bought more to stock owing to strike. However, prices of onion, tomato and potato remain stable. They are sold at less than Rs. 25 a kg in wholesale market as most of the stock is procured from Maharashtra and other parts of north India. Meanwhile, about 200 traders participated in a demonstration in support of the farmers demands for loan waiver and drought relief fund."

""We're avoiding anything that looks like a buffet table. We got in this morning and have already had five rounds of the buffet, eating chutney. If we don't leave the table, we'll become the Supersonic `rolling' Machine!"" exclaims Fabrizio Grossi , mixer and bassist for the band.Political cor rectness be damned. ""He's from another planet, we don't know this guy! I love chicken tikka masala,"" says Billy Gibbons with a smile. He is one-third of the rock-n-roll hall of fame band ZZ Top, running his skinny fingers through strands of that iconic ginger beard that he recently got insured. Meanwhile, guitarist-lead singer Lance Lopez is debating about his next food trail, ""Vada Pao or fish?"" Grossi explains: ""We've been a big fan of Indian art, culture, a big fan of Indian art, culture, history and food. So, to be here and be a part of the reality that is Mumbai is really fantastic.""The reality has been overwhelming too. ""We had quite the culture shock. The colours, the aromas, the noise... I wonder if there's a word for it that can put this experience in perspective,"" says Gibbons, who arrived before his other bandmates and was taken by surprise when stopped by friendly passers-by and quizzed about their headlining act at this year's Mahindra Blues Fest. ""It was quite surprising and very rewarding. We've got to raise the bar and step it up,"" he says, looking at his bandmates.Clearly, the city with its sights, sounds and smells has been tripping up this magic mix of bluesmen who have joined forces to keep the American musical phenomenon from falling in stature.It was in 2012 when Lopez and Grossi hooked up in Los Angeles to work on some new ideas that led to a whirlwind day in the studio and the foundation of a new project. The third part of the core was Indiana native drummer Kenny Aronoff, who joined the family next. A list of pioneering collaborators--Gibbons, Walter Trout, Warren Haynes, Robben Ford, Eric Gales and Chris Duarte--propelled it further.Their debut album West of Flushing, South of Frisco that released in 2015 is a sprawling and emotional journey that flits through different styles that Fabrizio would rather define as ""50 shades of blues"" before his Italian genes kick in. ""Blues, it's like pasta. You can add bolognese, tomato or clams, but the main ingredient is pasta!"" Even as days fly by with each one getting busy with their own gigs, Supersonic offers a breath of fresh air, they say. ""We maintain the spirit of a jam,"" says Grossi. ""What matters eventually is whether you're enjoying every moment of rehearsing, performing and hanging out,"" says Gibbons. ""We do."""

And, in northern Kerala, kidney stone is becoming a major health concern among workers in the Gulf.V.G. Pradeep Kumar, president, Kerala chapter, Indian Medical Association, said that over 80% of kidney diseases in the State were induced by hypertension and high blood sugar.Lifestyle changes are the main villain. The IMA has been running campaigns to create awareness on the issue. Many government hospitals now have lifestyle clinics which are addressing it, Dr. Kumar said.According to a study, around 30% of adults in Kerala are diabetic and 16% have high blood pressure. M. Thomas Mathew, former professor at Kozhikode Medical College, who is now senior consultant nephrologist at Baby Memorial Hospital here, said that those with high cholesterol levels too were at a higher risk of developing kidney diseases. The number of diabetic patients is more in Alappuzha and Pathanamthitta districts, he said.Kidney stone is another common problem found among the labourers who return from Gulf countries. It is caused by the extreme weather conditions in those countries and the contaminated water they consume. They use a lot of tomato in their food, like tomato juice and sauces. This leads to calcium deposits and later kidney stones, Dr. Mathew said.Focus on lifestyleHe said that increased focus on lifestyle changes would help prevent these problems.Regular health check-ups and screening blood and urine tests are a must. Smoking and alcohol consumption should be avoided. Control of diet, blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol and regular physical exercise will help, he said.Theme for the yearTo highlight these risks and to mark World Kidney Day, hospitals such as Baby Memorial Hospital and organisations such as the IMA are holding screening and awareness camps in the city on Thursday. The theme for this year is kidney diseases and obesity and overweight and how can it be prevented.World Kidney Day80% of kidney diseases induced by hypertension and high blood sugar30% of adults in Kerala are diabetic and 16% have high blood pressureKidney stone a major health concern among workers in the GulfIMA, hospitals to hold screening and awareness camps today"
