KarunakaranM_KarunakaranArchana*, an anganwadi worker in Aminjikarai, is busy feeding a two-year-old at her centre, when a child's mother comes in and drops a carrot in a small basket tied to the window. She quickly gets up, takes the vegetable and thanks the parent.If you can, please bring two tomatoes tomorrow. We are running short, she says. Sure, the parent responds. Do you need anything else? she asks. No ma. Sujata said she would get greens the day after, Ms. Archana replies and resumes feeding the child.Every morning, as the children are dropped off at her centre, at least one parent drops a vegetable of their choice in the basket. Ms. Subbulakshmi then uses it to prepare the meal of the day.I do not have enough money to buy vegetables every month. On request, one parent drops in a vegetable of their choice everyday and I use it to cook the meal. Sometimes, the basket remains empty and I have to spend from my pocket, she pointed out.Archana has been an anganwadi teacher for the last 25 years.I have my own family to take care of, and the money I finally take home is not enough to make ends meet. I need help, she said.Delay in refundBuying vegetables is a major source of difficulty for anganwadi workers in the city. They spend from their pocket when there is a shortage, but it takes a long time to get reimbursed.We have to be refunded within four months, but sometimes it takes six months or more, said an anganwadi teacher in Poonamallee on condition of anonymity. I look after 20 children at this centre. While I do my best to look after their needs, what I take home is minimal. I have three young children of my own to look after.In 2014, the Department of Social Welfare and Nutritious Meal Programme extended their variety meal scheme to all anganwadi centres across the State. It was based on the nutritional requirements of children in the age group of 2 to 5 years. The variety meal included mixed rice, vegetable rice, lemon rice, dhal rice, boiled potatoes and eggs, among other items.The Department later increased the feeding charges in anganwadis from 56 paise to Rs. 1.13 per child for days when dal is prepared, which includes 70 paise for vegetables, 24 paise for fuel/cylinder and the rest for condiments. When there is no dal on the menu, the allocation is Rs. 1.35, including 80 paise for vegetables, 36 paise for fuel/cylinder and the rest for condiments. However, 5 paise is deducted from spices, as salt is provided by the Civil Supplies Corporation.Add shortage of essential commodities like salt and palm oil to that of vegetables. Uma*, an anganwadi worker in Royapuram, has reportedly not received salt for the last four months. There are 25 children at her centre. Here, too, the workers seek handouts from parents.Every month, anganwadi workers make a list of essentials and hand it over to the respective Child Development Project Officers (CDPO). The lists are submitted to the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation which, in turn, sends the supplies to the anganwadis. In case of delay, workers use the buffer stock at their centres.Officials say no shortageOfficials from the Social Welfare Department brush off reports of delays. We recently checked and no such problem was reported. In case a few centres are facing problems, we shall look into them,"" said a senior official.K. Shanmugavelayutham, convener, TN-FORCES, said the State should provide a contingency grant to every anganwadi centre so that they can recoup and take steps accordingly. The workers are already earning a paltry sum and making them spend from their income is unreasonable. It is the children who suffer in the end, he said.( Names changed )"

Children who successfully answered questions in quizzes held after each event were presented with seeds and saplings as prizes.In his inaugural address, Mr. Krishnamurthy said, Change can be brought about only by children, because they have to know why they should turn down junk food. More than 200 seed packets of vegetables like brinjal, tomato, chilli and drumsticks were given away to children who attended the programme. The school campus was gifted with saplings of shade-giving and flowering trees by Yugaa.As part of our youth awareness campaigns, we feel such events will help children understand the process of food production from the scratch, said Allirani Balaji, president of Yugaa. A practical exposure to planting and agricultural practices will have a more lasting impact on young minds than book-based learning, she added."

The yield is high now, and so is supply. At present, a gunny bag of cabbage consisting 50 kilos is priced at Rs. 150 to Rs. 200 in the wholesale market. During the corresponding period last year, a gunny bag of cabbage was priced at Rs. 1,000. In the retail market, cabbage is sold for Rs. 5 to Rs. 10, he added. Cabbage is supplied from Hosur and parts of Andhra Pradesh.However, Mr. Balu said that the rates of vegetables might start to increase as the mercury level rises. When the sun soars, the production will be affected and there will be water scarcity. Usually, the rates of vegetables will climb up at this time. It is likely that the costs might go up in March, he added."

The farmers invested some Rs. 42,000 for mulching process apart from setting up drip irrigation system in their farms. They cultivated tomato in another five acres in the conventional method.Low pricesBy the time the crop was ready to be harvested the price of tomato crashed. The farmers were left with no option but to leave the crop to rot in the field. At the price prevailing in the market then they would not even realise the cost of harvesting and transport to the market. All the man days they have invested in the farm, labour cost and other investments have gone down the drain.The case of Abdul Rehman, few kilometres away, is no different. He owns some four acres and he decided to take on lease another eight acres and he cultivated carrot in two acres and tomato in another two acres.Rotting in the fieldAll his efforts yielded a bumper crop and he expected good returns. The fate did not favour him and market crashed.The situation was so bad that the prevailing market price would not even cover the cost of harvesting and cleaning the crop for market. The crop has been in the field beyond 90 days and today the healthy-looking carrots have rotted inside.For drip Mr. Rehman has invested Rs. 25,000 while Rs. 75,000 subsidy was offered by the government.I made a total investment of Rs. 25,000 for each acre and the accumulated loss for the crop is about Rs. 1 lakh. Every day I have to pay Rs. 200 for labour transport as they have to come from Sangareddy or Kandi, Mr. Rehman told The Hindu .He is regretting his having chosen to cultivate vegetables over cotton."

Beans are presently being cultivated only in Malur region, where too, the crop has been severely hit.Brinjals are being sold at an unprecedented Rs. 60 plus levels a kg. The prices of greens and cucumber  much in demand during summer have also seen a big jump in their prices.

Other vegetables like ladys finger, beetroot and radish are also being sold at higher than usual rates at Rs. 38, Rs. 40 and Rs. 32 respectively. Coconut prices have been trading at the higher end of Rs. 30-Rs. 33 for the past two months and has seen no correction.A senior procurement official at a leading retail chain in the city said that the chief problem had been fall in supplies. Some of the vegetables like gourds, cauliflower, beetroot and others are of very poor quality and even if one is ready to pay more, there is no quality product available in the market, he said.S.H. Keshav, manager, procurement and marketing, Hopcoms, said the arrival of most of the vegetables have fallen by over 40% and if the pre-monsoon rain failed in the coming months, the vegetable market would only head further northwards.G. Muniswamy Gowda, a vegetable farmer from Chennarayapatna on the city outskirts said, water scarcity and rising temperature had hit the crops severely. The water levels in the borewells have fallen in the last one month and there isnt enough water available for the crops. It is for the first time in the last many years that we are not cultivating our full 8 acres of land, but only a part of it, he said.The only vegetables to be trading at affordable prices are onions and potatoes which are below Rs. 20 a kg. The climate is now apt for onions and the market is being flooded with a good supply, said a leading onion merchant at the APMC Yard in Yeshwanthpur.

But how long I am going to meet their needs, I dont knowAnnakiliVendorIn the last 10 to 15 days, there is a huge drop in the arrival of vegetables in uzhavar sandhais, much to the surprise of not only retail buyers, but even the traders and farmers themselves.Beans sold at Rs. 20 a kg till a fortnight back is being sold at Rs. 55 to Rs. 60. Shallot which was sold at Rs. 15 to 18 a kg, is now Rs. 50. Tomatoes, available for as low as Rs. 6 in January is sold for Rs. 25 to Rs. 30. Prices of drumstick and brinjal have also gone up. There appears to be a 30 to 50 per cent rise in prices of select vegetables in the citys two biggest uzhavar sandhais at Anna Nagar and B.B. Kulam.After these markets were started over a decade ago, there has been a direct connect between the farmers and the end-consumers. Despite change in governments, officials have given value-additions to these markets in the form of cold storage facility to stock the produce, electronic scales etc.The district administration is also striving to keep these markets free of plastic bags. Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao conducts periodic checks on the general functioning of the farmers markets and whether the rules laid out for the farmers were followed. All these measures have resulted in the success of the uzhavar sandhai concept.The prices of vegetables are fixed on a daily basis in sync with the arrivals at the Central Vegetable Market near Mattuthavani. There is also a huge wholesale vegetable market at Paravai, run by a private consortium.According to officials, about 200 tonnes of vegetables are sold by the two uzhavar sandhais by 400 registered farmers. Though there is a less popular  uzhavar sandhai on Anaiyur Main Road.The registered farmers, who raise vegetables on their own fields, bring them to the markets by public transport. On arrival, the officials fix the prices on a weighted average method by taking the prices quoted in central market and private chain stores, thus making it attractive for cost-conscious buyers.Reason for the dipA senior official attributed the sudden dip in arrival of vegetables to the prevailing drought conditions in the State. Every day, the temperature is rising sharply and water sources are fast depleting. Even places which are considered fertile pockets do not have enough water. As a result, a farmer who used to harvest 10 sacks of Brinjal is able to get just two sacks now. Rain alone can save the farmers, he saidIronically, though there was 84 mm rainfall in March in Madurai city and its peripheries till Sunday, against the normal average of 24 mm, the rain was abnormal and did not serve the purpose.When the farmers wanted rains, there were none. The abnormal temperature has only worsened the situation now, Valarmathi, who sells carrot and brinjal in BB Kulam  uzhavar sandhai said.After failure of monsoon, she has started getting English vegetables from Kodaikanal where her husband is growing them in a small piece of land belonging to their relative.I dont want to say no to my regular customers when they ask for specific items. But how long I am going to meet their needs, I dont know, Annakili, another vendor, said.At Anna Nagar  uzhavar sandhai, the first to be opened in Tamil Nadu by the then Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, the mood of farmers is the same.It is expected that the prices of vegetables will be volatile till the end of summer.When the farmers wanted rains, there were none.

The worst-affected were drumstick growers.Chettiyapatti, Kalikampatti, Munnilaikottai, Nadupatti and adjacent areas were major drumstick production centres in the union. Drumstick has also been cultivated as intercrop in tomato and onion fields.Several farmers preferred hybrid plant variety of drumstick to traditional variety for better yield and little maintenance.Already, several bore wells and open wells at these villages dried up owing to the acute drought, creating a shortage of water for irrigation. Residents have been running from pillar to post for water for drinking and other purposes.With no sources to maintain regular supply, horticulturists have started purchasing water from Dindigul and nearby areas to protect the standing crops.S. Palani, farmer in Kalikkampatti, said though drumstick crop was drought- tolerant, a minimum quantity of water was required to keep the plant alive.The plants should be irrigated at least once in two or three days. We had to shell out a sizable amount of money for water. Suppliers deliver water in lorries and tractors, he added.Intermittent showers in the past two days brought some relief. But it was only temporary and it would not help the horticulturists in the long run, he added.The farmers in area said already debt burden had been haunting many who had small land holdings.Several fund- starved farmers were in distress as they could not afford to buy water to protect the standing crops. Now their fate was in the hands of rain god, they said."

Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam, the price of most vegetables has gone up by Rs. 1 to Rs. 2 per kg.As Mr. Balu puts it, In the summer, many vegetables perish easily and so the cost of perishable vegetables has doubled.

From Rs. 8 a kg last month, the price has gone up to Rs. 15, and is now Rs. 20, he said.When summer is here, vegetable production will be hit and subsequently supply will be affected. With acute water shortage across the State, farmers will most likely find it hard to cultivate crops and yield a good harvest. Also, there has been an increase in pest attacks on the produce over the last few summers.Combination of factorsAll these factors, coupled with the increase in fuel prices and transportation cost have led to a rise in prices, he said.Earlier, a bag of 60-70 kg of cabbage cost Rs. 300 to Rs. 350 in the wholesale market. Now, it costs Rs. 500, he said. Onions offer some solace for customers as the price ranges between Rs. 8 and Rs. 16 in the retail market.Small onions are sold for Rs. 25 to Rs. 40, while the local variety of brinjal (thorny) is priced at Rs. 30 a kg.

He also said that such large-scale crop-loss was having an adverse effect on the agricultural biosafety which was paramount to food security.Nematodes, consisting of roundworms, threadworms and eelworms, are causing loss of crops to the tune of almost 60 million tonnes or 10-12 % of crop production every year, said Mr. Chakrabarty. He was speaking at the XIII Annual Group Meeting of All India Co-ordinated Research Project (AICRP) on Nematodes in Cropping System in the city on Friday. The farmers are still not fully aware about these potential crop-destroyers, he added.The Dean of Indian Council of Agricultural Research HS Gaur expressed his apprehension about the spread of nematode in the country. Citing the instance of a particular kind of nematode which affected plants such as potatoes and tomatoes, he said the Potato Cyst Nematode was first discovered in the Nilgiris and had now spread to various parts of the country."

Wisps of smoke rise in the air and disappear in the medley of sound and colour that this street around Jama Masjid in Old Delhi is known for. You see men, old and young, grilling kababs on their small barbecues. Crowds gather in the evenings, just as the sun sets, for an evening snack or an early dinner.The Walled City has its own rules. Lanes devoted to vegetarian food open up at dawn. Thats when you get breakfast fare of crisp kachoris and runny potato curries, or juicy jalebis and thickened, creamy milk. In other parts of the Old City, the food stalls come to life in the evenings. Thats when the grills come out, along with the skewers and marinated meat.In this street called Urdu Bazaar, there is a small counter at the end of a lane. Thats where you find Anmol Chicken Corner, where the grilled chicken is so good  and so deliciously sinful  that you dont forget it once you have had a taste of it.Untold delightsAround the lanes of Jama Masjid, you can see spot eateries with little hillocks of marinated chicken pieces or whole chicken hanging from iron rods. They are cooked in different ways  grilled in a tandoor or on a rack over an open fire or simply fried. For many die-hard chicken lovers, these lanes promise untold delights.But Anmol is different. It sells butter chicken, which is not to be confused with the butter chicken  tandoori chicken in a tomato-and-cream based sauce  that Delhi is known for. Anmols butter chicken is just what the two words imply  chicken in butter.Relatively newIn Old Delhi, where some eateries are over a 100 years old, Anmol is relatively new  they have been at the spot for the last 20 years or so. Every day, some 100 kilos of chicken are grilled and served. It has become quite a rage in the city, popular both with local residents and distant tourists and food walkers.If you are there any evening, you will find at the counter a mound of marinated pieces of chicken, boneless or with bone, in a huge wide-bottomed vessel known as a paraat. Next to is a large slab of butter. The ustad at the counter grills the chicken on a skewer over a coal fire. Once done, the pieces are put in a bowl. A masala is sprinkled over it  a mix of chillies, dried mango powder and chaat masala  and a spoonful of chutney. In a pan, a slab of butter is heated and once it melts into a golden liquid, it is poured over the chicken. The pot is given a good shake, and Anmols butter chicken  hot, spicy, buttery and juicy  is ready. It is served with sliced onions and some green chutney prepared with chopped coriander leaves and chillies.The butter softens the meat, seeping into it and giving it its own distinct flavour and aroma. Eaten there and then, hot off the grill, Anmols butter chicken is heavenly.Long after the last morsel has been eaten, the taste stays within you. And the aroma haunts you like a fragrant ittar."

They demanded a statement on the issue from Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, the Agriculture Minister and Cooperation Minister, who looks after cold storages.Bahinipati said farmers of Keonjhar district on Monday dumped quintals of fresh tomatoes on the road in front of the Collectors office after being unable to sell the produce at proper price. They even could not get 50 paise per kg of tomatoes in Keonjhar and preferred to dump them on road, Bahinipati said and added that farmers of Rayagada, Koraput and Bargarh districts had also faced similar situation earlier. He alleged that demonetisation has seriously affected the farmers financially.Speaker Niranjan Pujaris repeated calls to keep the House in order fell on deaf ears. Unable to run the House, Pujari adjourned the Assembly twice till 3 pm. The House was adjourned from 11.33 am to 11.48 am and later to 3 pm as noisy scenes continued over the issue.Similar situation continued after the House reassembled after lunch at 3 pm forcing the Speaker to adjourn the Assembly for the day at 3.05 pm.

The imported white wines Villa Antinori from Toscana and Ricossa Gavi DOCG from Piemonte and the red wine Santa Cristina from Tuscany are perfect accompaniments. The fruity Toscana wine complements the earthy starters.The other white wine from Piemonte is more citrusy and goes well with the rich, creamy texture of buckwheat pasta (which tastes like ragi). The crunchy and meaty chicken is also paired well with the sour red wine.The raw and marinated vegetables such as zucchini, carrots and broccoli served on a layer of basil cream cheese in the starter Insalata di Vergue di Prato (Lombardia) taste fresh.The menu reads the vegetables are grilled, and they been rightly done without being smoked or charred. A specialty of Lombardia, a region in North Italy known for its art and culture, the dish is healthy and filling.Then comes the soup. The La Cisra (piemonte) is a chickpeas soup served with winter vegetables. It takes us by surprise as chickpeas is an unusual ingredient in soup.The chef informs us that this soup is usually prepared with pork in Italy. As in India more people prefer vegetarian to meat, he prepared the soup with the stalk of chickpeas. The boiled carrots and onions in the soup make it chunkier and more colourful.Unlike the usual Italian pasta preparations with tomato, Pizzoccheri di Teglio (V) (Lombardia) is prepared with buckwheat fresh pasta, potato and savoy cabbage.

Skin being the most absorbent organ of the body, requires special care. With the environment already unleashing high level of toxins on our health, its time to be alert about not just our lifestyle, what we eat, drink and even breathe, but also what we apply on your body. This is where Ayurveda come to your rescue. Unlike beauty regimens, Ayurveda is ideal for all skin types.In conversation with Hyderabad Express, Dr GG Gangadharan, Director Ramaiah Indic Specialty Ayurveda, Ayurvedic advisor, Lever Ayush, reveals why it is time to throw those bottles and tubes of creams and packs, and head to the kitchen and fridge instead.We often witness college-goers wrap their faces in dupattas to keep away the pollution but it still gets to them. Suggest some skin care routine.Wash face with lukewarm water mixed with 1tsp honey and 1 tsp lemon juice twice a day (in the morning and as soon as you reach home). Massage face and neck with oil which helps in enhancing complexion like Chemparathyadi Coconut oil (based with hibiscus) and Nalpamaradi Coconut oil (Based on Nalpamara viz., Ficus family and Turmeric). These medicines are available in all Ayurvedic pharmacies. If you are used to drinking milk, boil garlic (3 gms, peeled, washed and crushed) in 1 cup of milk, filter and take it internally at bed time. Alternatives are: honey (1 tsp) mixed with 1 glass of lemon water or carrot juice mixed with orange juice. This regular routine will help clear the pores of the face and keep the skin fresh.Models and creative artistes put on a lot of makeup viz., toner, primer, foundation etc. What kind of Ayurvedic products can one use to protect skin from an onslaught of such cosmetics?Generally synthetic ingredients cannot give any textural enhancement, and some of them are even harmful to the skin if used over long periods. It is better to protect the skin on a daily basis by mild face massage with Nalpamaradi Coconut oil/ Nisoushiradi tailam/ Eladi Coconut oil and face steam with tulsi (Basil leaves) water. Doing this on a regular basis shall help to open the clogged pores and remove the impurities thereby preventing harm to skin. Later cleanse the face with any vegetable pulp (e.g., cucumber/ tomato Pulp) or fruits like orange pulp/ fresh black grapes pulp. Then wash your face with fresh lukewarm water and put face mask with fine coriander powder with coconut milk and honey. Regular maintenance with above said facial care shall help maintain the skin texture and tone.Suggest a few tips on combating the pollutants in the city traffic.To protect from the pollutants in the traffic, it is better to scrub the face with a handful of incha (bark of the climber Acacia intsia, traditionally used for bathing after Ayurveda oil massage) which is available in all Ayurveda stores. Then wash with lukewarm water and gently massage with pure coconut oil and face steam with lemon water (cut the lemon into pieces and boil in water). Then massage the face, neck, shoulder with a paste of green gram boiled in milk and honey. Along with this, hydrate face with cooked rice water. Apply, face pack with carrot, tomato pulp.Suggest some personal care across the day using five or six proven Ayurvedic tips.The best method of personal care is using regular oil bath. This routine can be done at home or at an Ayurveda centre. Oil like pure coconut oil/ sesame oil can be used. An Ayurveda doctor will be able to select a suitable oil based on your body nature and general constitution.Exercise and Yoga enables one to improve inhalation of more oxygen and thereby purifies the body. This aids cell repair (hair follicle included) and activates metabolism.Early to bed, early to rise and early morning bowel evacuation is important for healthy body and skin.Regular eye wash and application of medicated collyrium (anjana) is important to maintain eye health.Regular foot massage during bed time after cleaning feet is advisable which helps to relax the nerves of body and ensures good sleep. It also helps to protect the eyes.Wholesome food habitsProactive in performing regular, designated and rightful duties towards oneselfand for the nation.Does loose hair touching cheeks cause any harm to the skin? If yes, then what can be doneabout it?Hair is of elastic nature. Continuous rubbing can scar the skin thereby reducing the softness of cheeks. Apply a cream made by swirlingbutter in turmeric (Kastoorimanjal) and honey on cheeks.What do you think are fiveessentials that every youngster in a polluted city must consume everyday to maintain good health and clear skin?Avoid Constipation. Hydrate the body tissues by regularly drinking adequate water.Accelerate the skin peeling process by having regular bath after body massage with oil.Regeneration of body cells is essential which can be enhanced by regular intake of amalaki, ghee, honey and milk.Staple food specific to the region should be consumed. Eat seasonal fruits and vegetablesAyurveda advises to take green gram soup and horse gram soup which help in maintaining the minerals, vitamins and protein required for the body. Green gram soup recipe: Soak a handful of green gram dhal overnight. Pressure cook the same until it is well cooked.

The dish is served in a glass jar.The Dear Fluffy is the morning meal that will score you major attention on your Instagram feed. The serve is colourful with a fluffy omlette customised to your style of toppings - mushrrom, masala, cheese, ham and bacon. The egg is served with toast, a crispy and delicious hash brown with girlled tomatoes and sauteed mushrooms on the side.The French Me doesnt exactly taste of a classic French toast, but instead is a generous spread of sugary jam in a sandwiched toast. It is served with a brandy infused cherry sauce. For those craving for a sugar high and a cherry shot of alcohol, this ones for you.The Drunken Bulls Eye is a red wine minute steak served with two sunny side up eggs. The steak was a bit under-cooked, but the eggs were gooey and tasty.If you are a fan of Keralite breakfast, order the Appam and stew here. The stew is the I have ever had. And this mind you, is coming from a Mallu, herself. It is hot, creamy and has a generous amount of colourful vegetables such as brocilli and carrots. The appam, however, wasnt as fluffy as one would like.Sotally Tober also serves guilt free beverages for the health concious. Carrot and basil and Cucumber and mint both make refreshing morning drinks and does not taste of any artificial elements.I would recommend the Maggi with bacon and the Dear Fluffy if you are looking forward to a heavy and healthy breakfast.The dishes reviewed in the article are part of Sotally Tobers Bombaaat Breakfast menu.The chef sent us a warm serving of pancakes with chocolate chip, served with fresh wipped cream and maple syrup to end the meal. It was everything I had hoped for, and more. The pancakes were soft, fluffy with melted chocolate chips infused in them. The cream was light, almost of foam consistency.

However, the situation might change, if the strike continues, warn experts.As many as three lakh lorries in the State went off the roads from Thursday pressing for their demands which include withdrawal of the Centres order increasing the third-party insurance and high toll tax collection on State highways. Though the lorry owners association has exempted essential services like milk, medicines, water and petrol from the purview of the stir, some sections of petrol tank operators have joined the stir across the State on Saturday.""Of the total 1,500 petrol tankers, only 500 were operated on the third day of the stir. Already the petroleum sales have dipped by 60 per cent from Monday, the petrol tankers association has also decided to join the stir in a full-fledged manner. If this happens, the petroleum users across the State might face a serious problem, said Andhra Pradesh Federation of Petroleum Dealers (APFPD) president R Gopala Krishna.Speaking to Express, Rythu Bazar estate officer M Ramesh Babu said that indefinite lorry strike has no impact on the vegetable prices. Most of the vegetables are procured from the nearby villages across the city through auto rickshaws and APSRTC buses. Moreover, the vegetable prices are slashed by Rs 5 on each variety as this is the harvesting season for all the horticulture crops, he said.Veggies turn dearer as arrivals declineThe prices of vegetables also remained stable in Visakhapatnam, Guntur and Rajamahendravaram, but the situation was different in Kurnool. The strike has created artificial scarcity of essential commodities, especially vegetables and their prices are going skyward.As Kurnool city depends on vegetable imports from places like Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and other places, the supply constraints due to lorry strike burnt holes in the pockets of consumers.Kurnool imports potato and ginger from Delhi, Agra, Gujarat and nearly 100 tonnes arrives every day to the local markets. Because of strike, potato prices have doubled from Rs 15 to Rs 30 per kg, while ginger too saw similar price hike from Rs 25 to Rs 50 per kg. Tomatoes which were regular imports from Kadapa, Chittoor and Mahabubnagar districts also had its prices doubled from Rs 15 per kg."

The meat is chewy and the creamy coleslaw retains a bite. This heavy is topped with a sunny-side-up egg, which has soft edges. On the side, you get lightly toasted, crisp slices of bread, (too sweet) baked beans, herbed and grilled potatoes, (indifferently) grilled tomato and a cup of tea or coffee or juice. If you can have this and still manage a dessert, you should audition for Man v/s Food.The Ham Basket, despite its few weak links, makes for a great breakfast.If you like something lighter, stick to the pancakes. They are fluffy and mildly sweetened and the chef makes them with soyamilk on request (if you are intolerant to dairy). I suggest the pancakes with maple syrup (a common favourite) and pancakes with caramelised bananas. If you have a sweet tooth, you can order these with whipped cream and any of the fruity crushes.I havent tried their coffee but their teas are worth going back for. I have gone back to have their ginger tea, it is watery and generous with the ginger. Their pot of masala tea, with the same consistency and the strong flavour, is also a good order. These cups are for mornings before a brisk walk in the sun or, for evenings, to wake you up for polite conversations.The Srilankan Curry with Steamed Rice and Salad is thick with coconut milk. Therefore, it is mostly bland but the salad goes perfectly with it. The salad has purple and green cabbage, mixed with shredded coconut and crushed peanuts. You may bite an occasional slice of chilli in it.The salad comes with the Malaysian Chicken Massaman Curry with Steamed Rice too. This one, blander than the Srilankan dish, has lightly cooked potatoes and soft pieces of chicken in it.Spicy Prawn Curry with Mint Rice and Peanut Salad is more tomato based and tastes like sambar as a friend said. This does not take away from its goodness and the mint in the rice is more a nudge, than a push.In the desserts, we try the waffle with vanilla ice cream. This smells of a warm kitchen with fresh loaves of bread and the ice cream is whisked to the right smoothness. That said, if you do not like eggs or the smell of eggs, dont have this.Price for two: Rs 1,000 (mains and tea)"

On seeing this, Maadesh along with a farm worker H Bashwaraj (37) shot one of the elephant in the crew with a country made gun and the 8-year-old female elephant sustained bullet injuries and died on the spot.Forest department officials managed to arrest Maadesh and are on look out for the absconding accused Bashwaraj.Thali Police and Hosur Forest Department officials have registered a case and are probing into the matter. The forest veterinarians will conduct an autopsy, said the officials."

The only government-run cold storage in Rayagada was inaugurated by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik in 2013 but it has been lying unused since then.The equipment are now damaged and the building has developed cracks. It was constructed at a cost of three crore rupees over one acre of land in Rayagada town with a storage capacity of 5,000 MT.The godown was constructed by the Marketing Federation of Government of Odisha (MARKFED).After completion of the cold storage facility, MARKFED handed over the facility to Tribal Development Co-operative Corporation (TDCC) under the Tribal Welfare department for maintenance.Though traders and farmers were invited to use it, the rent being demanded by the TDCC was apparently too high. Subsequently, no trader or farmer evinced interest in using the facility.At present, Rs 13,000 is being paid towards the electricity bill of the godown. Apparently, the power tariff would have gone up to two lakh rupees if it was made operational.Power accounts for 70 per cent of the operating expenses of cold storages. As the cold storage operator would have passed on the cost to farmers and traders, they refrained from using it, said Pratap Sahoo, a trader.Even as the local administration assured the traders and farmers of meeting the electricity expenses, the latter did not turn up. As it remained unused for years, the equipment, wooden racks and ceiling of the cold storage developed cracks and the roof leaked every time it rained.Last year, the State Government sanctioned Rs 63 lakh for TDCC to repair the cold storage. However, as there are no technical staff in the TDCC, the funds were diverted to Horticulture department.But work is yet to begin. Branch Manager of TDCC, Ashok Patra, who is also a member of the godown supervision committee, said the tender for the godown repair has been already floated and work would begin soon. It will have facilities to store tamarind, tomatoes, mangoes, pineapples and other vegetables, he added."

But I initially started off as a student of hotel management in Thanjavur. I worked in prominent hotel groups in Coonoor and Coorg where I honed my skills.Sunish P SurendranI have also had the opportunity to work on some government project (on a contract), while also occasionally lending a hand to aspiring chefs at culinary institutes. My style of cuisine is mostly Mediterranean  the one thing that I love about it is that it is so varied in style!The Mediterranean belt consists of nearly 21 countries from Turkey, Cyprus, Italy, France, Morocco and several North African countries, each with similar preparation style with tweaks in names and ingredients. So it gives you regional variations of the same dish, which is fascinating to cook. One of my favourite Mediterranean dishes is Tajine which is from North Africa. It has steamed meat, vegetables, and spices cooked in clay earthen pots. It is a very popular main course dish that can be adapted to Indian style of cooking as well. Mostly, it is served along with couscous.Another favourite of mine is the Ratatouille. I also served as the Chef Garde Manager (keeper of the food) at several hotels where I was in charge of the cold cuts and salad sections. Im equally adept at whipping up favourites like Caesars and Greek salads in veg and non-veg combinations. I prefer to use homemade products rather than sourced products. I prefer fresh herbs for cooking that I handpick from the market.The thing about Mediterranean is that it can easily be adapted as fusion food; in fact, Tajine is most commonly made with tomato puree that gives it a sour taste which Indians may not find palatable. So I make it with our own Indian garam masala and spices and grind them to give it a unique taste and aroma! Your cooking will not be worth the hard work if you do not have a presentation style that suits the dish, only then will the customer also feel satisfied. You have to cook a dish like you are cooking it for yourself for it to actually come out well."

The fate of the flora and fauna in the region has become a cause for concern with the Met department calling the impending summer a cruel one  Albin MathewKOCHI: Stay coolBesides the unbearable heat, summer season is also well known for the health problems that it brings in its wake. Express gives a few dietary tips that will help Kochiites beat the heatDrink lots of waterThis one is obvious, but it cant be repeated enough. In summer your body is prone to dryness as water is literally evaporating off you. So even more than usual, keep your body hydrated by drinking plenty of water.If plain water seems too boring, add a couple of slices of cucumber, a few berries, a squirt of lemon, or a few sprigs of lemon balm to keep you coming back for more.Coconut water: Coconut is full of health benefits and has wonderful cooling properties. It is laden with simple sugars, electrolytes and essential minerals which help keep the body well hydrated.Lime water: The simple lime water or nimboo pani is not only refreshing, it also has health benefits for you.Butter milk: A glass everyday to avoid dehydration and indigestion.Curd and Yoghurt: They are a great and healthy alternative to ice-cream as they are packed with nutrients, vitamins and calcium which help to soothe ulcers, allergies and heat boils during the season. Juices: Fresh fruit juices, including lemonade, help replenish the body of its lost fluids.VegetablesRaw vegetables are always cooling, but due to their high water content, the 5 veggies like cucumbers, radishes, lettuce, celery, spinach are especially good. Vegetables like onions, tomatoes and cucumbers should be regularly eaten as they will not only cool down the body but provide the daily quota of nutrition as well.Onions: Onions have amazing cooling properties. Red onions, in particular, are very rich in quercetin, which is a natural anti-allergen. Having lots of onions can provide you protection against sunstroke.Cucumber: This crunchy vegetable costs little, has lots of fibre that can help keep constipation at bay.Mint Mint is a simple, easily available, inexpensive herb which you can add to your curd to make pudina raita or have it in the form of chutneys besides using it in dips. The best thing about it is that you can grow it in a small pot at home for your use.Cardamom: A cup of cardamom tea can do wonders for those who have been in the hot sun for long because of its detoxifying properties.FruitsJust like raw vegetables, fruits are almost always cooling to the system. You can eat them directly as a snack or dessert, make a smoothie, or add them to your water for a tasty refreshing experience. Gooseberry (Amla): A great refresher and reverses the ageing effects caused by strong sun rays while providing extra stamina for gym sessions. It specially benefits heart and hair.Watermelon: If youre thirsty, watermelon works wonders in replenishing lost fluids for the body, Watermelon will keep you cool, hydrated, satiated and healthy. Melons contain lycopene that protects your skin against sun damage.Berries: Not only are these little gems delicious and sweet, but they are also packed with flavonoids that provide antioxidant benefits. They can also promote increased blood flow to your skin and decrease your sensitivity to light to improve your skins appearance, structure and texture,Pineapple: Pineapples provide a good mix of vitamins, antioxidants and enzymes like bromelain that can protect your body against inflammation.Mango: Mangos are packed with vitamin A and C.Papaya: Some people use papaya juice to tenderize meat or as a natural exfoliating ingredient for healthy and glowing skin. But there are also nutritional benefits to eating papaya on its own.Fish, especially ShellfishAgain tapping into the oceans coolness, Chinese medicine recognizes most fish as cool, and shellfish as cold in nature. This means that even after theyre cooked, the result of eating fish, especially shellfish, will be to counteract any heat thats lingering in your system.Foods not to eatYou must avoid burgers with meat patties, fries and other oily fare. Burgers and summer may sound like a match made in heaven, but the fact is they can give your body temperature a spike. Foods that contain high amounts of protein and fat heat up your body. They move slowly through the digestive system, causing your body to use more energy. However, the spike in temperature isnt enough to cause you to sweat and cool down, which happens when you eat spicy foods on hot days.(Inputs from Susan Itty,Clinical Nutritionist, Aster MediCity)"

With incidents of hate crime rising in the Land of Opportunity, many students are now having second thoughts on choosing US as a preferred destination for higher studies.Why spend tens of thousands of dollars on education in another country when you can avail the same at Germanys top institutes at practically zero cost, with the added benefit of securing attractive scholarships, says Amita Desai, Founding Director of Goethe-Zentrum Hyderabad (GZH).Barring a few specialised courses, education in Germany is free. After studies, you have a two-year window to search for jobs, and the duration of the work visa depends on the employer, adds Amita.For students interested in learning German, we are open seven days a week.Comprising different batches, courses begin at 6:30 am and continue till 8 pm. We also train teachers at 25 schools, including Kendriya Vidyalayas, etc., and work with them to upgrade their skills, said Padmavathi, Head of Language department at GZH.Not just education, Germany is taking big strides in the field of environment sustainability, says Amita. Chancellor Angela Merkel set a 10-year goal in 2011 for the country to be free of nuclear energy. Currently, nearly two-thirds of Germany runs on clean energy, and that is a big accomplishment, she adds.Seeking to replicate Germanys success story in environment, GZH, in association with Chirec International School and Green Gables International School in the city, has recently started a programme KiddoGardener. This is a three-month initiative to create urban farmers in kids and teach them environmentally sustainable ways of growing vegetables, said Narsing Arravally, Founder of KiddoGardener.Practicing what they preach, the terrace of Goethes guesthouse, adjacent to GZH office, is cultivating Brinjal, Capsicum, Tomatoes, Lettuce, Coriander, and many other vegetables, without the use of pesticides.Workshops are also being taught to schoolchildren on various topics such as plastic management, pest management, recycling used items, compost management, garbage segregation, etc., adds Narsing.Amita Desai is also the Honorary Representative of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg. She oversees two-way promotion of art and culture initiatives between Hyderabad and Hamburg.Recently, two designers came from Hamburg, and over 20 students worked with them on architecture designs. We also have yearly school-exchange programmes between Hamburg and Hyderabad, she adds.On future goals, Amita adds that for the convenience of learners, plans are on to create additional language centres, one each in Secunderabad and Kukatpally.Signing off, Amita Desai says, We shouldnt be building walls, but breaking them.

A 39-year-old rooftop gardener, who has made it a point to eat poison-free food, grows his own fruits and vegetables. Sanjeev Jaganmohan Anand Rao also maintains a seed bank which presently consists of 70 varieties of native seeds.Working with CISCO Systems, this Bengalurean takes time off on weekends to tend to his plants. I grow vegetables such as brinjals (aubergine), cucumber, and different varieties of gourds such as bottle gourd and sponge gourd on the roof top. I also grow fruits such as pomegranate and chikoo. He thanks his father in law for starting him on gardening and says he now gets guidance from his uncle who owns a farm.Sanjeev chooses to procure grafted varieties of seeds from a certified vendor for his fruit plants. If you try to grow fruit plants from seeds, it will take a while. The first yield may take at least three years if you dont use grafted seeds. He plants them in paint buckets and plastic drums.Every three months, his plants yield three kgs of pomegranate. He shares his produce with his friends and colleagues after keeping a bit away for his family.Sanjeev believes in organic gardening, free of insecticides and pesticides. I dont use any kind of chemical, he says. I prefer pure, homemade pesticides such as sour curd for spraying on the plants. It will deter the insects. If sour curd is kept outside for a couple of days, the sourness in it will get rid of insects. Neem oil is my last resort. It is the strongest in the organic spray.He started gardening in his balcony experimenting with spinach leaves. They did well and I began growing tomatoes in paint buckets... It has been three and half years since and I grow almost everything on the terrace, including strawberries, says the gardener who hasnt visited his neighbourhood market for the past one year.Sanjeev stresses on watering plants right. I have put a timer on the drip irrigation system and it takes care of watering. I customised the whole system without taking any help from a third party, he says. Watering is the most important thing in gardening. We should neither water more nor less. For Bengalurus climate, I water only once every two days.Sanjeev visits his rooftop garden twice a day and spends his weekends tending to it, removing weeds and planting new plants."

The Central Prison at Poojappura has opened a vegetable store on its premises where you can buy fresh vegetables grown in an organic way.The sales counter, launched as part of governments Haritha Keralam Mission, is near the main gate of the central prison. It was opened by Haritha Keralam Mission vice-chairman T N Seema on Thursday. In the first phase the counter will be open for three days per week - Monday, Wednesday and Friday.The inaugural day witnessed a huge crowd which according to the jail authorities has boosted their confidence. Around 25 types of vegetables were sold out at the counter by noon, said Deputy Prison Officer Ajayakumar, who coordinates farming activities in the Central Jail.A cultural programme organised as part of the expoVegetables which were in high demand included ladies finger, pumpkin, bitter gourd, tomato, ivy gourd, raw banana and long beans. We did not bring the produce in huge quantities since it was the inaugural day. But literally everything was sold out by noon, Ajayakumar said.Another attraction of the stall is the discounted rate offered. Vegetables are priced even lower than the Horticorp rates.The idea of opening a regular stall was mooted by T N Seema during a public function in the central jail last month. Produces of the Open Jail, Nettukaltheri will also be sold through the stall.Farming is done in over ten hectares of the central jail. 30 prisoners have been tasked with the upkeep of the farm.

There are palms that can be tucked into a corner of your living room, ferns that can spill out of ceramic containers for your dining table or trees with glossy leaves that can shade your reading nook from a glaring sun. We speak to gardeners and ask them to share their secrets on indoor gardening. A good reference point to start would be the NASAs list of indoor and air-filtering plants.Namratha, Smart GardensAccording to this greenskeeper, it is vital to maintain proper cross ventilation in the planting area. Interior trees need more sunlight than the others, and Dracaena can be the best tree to grow indoors. Areca Palms, temple tree, lucky bamboos and ficus can be grown as well. ""Indoor plants require more care and attention than the outdoor ones, says Namratha. It is vital to give the plants organic and nutritious soil with a mix of vermicompost and coco peat to retain water. To start with, plant lettuce, gourd, tomato, radish and brinjal. ""Indoor plants need to be trained to accept very less sunlight and perform photosynthesis with that minimal amount of light, she says. They eventually start growing well with good care and mineral supplements. She also suggests air-purifying plants such as mints, aloe-vera, spider plants and snake plants.Vandhana, Urban MaliAccording to Vandhana, there are no fully shade-loving trees. On NASAs research on air-purifying plants, she says that our air-conditioners, refrigerators and other appliances emit many invisible toxins and the Red-edged Dracaena, Golden Pothos and Chrysanthemum can clear the air. ""For indoor trees, find a spot with maximum sunlight and spaces such as good courtyards, she says. A small tree can grow in a 3-feet container but it will eventually grow weak and die. She recommends, instead, plants that usually grow under the canopy in the forests. Research about foliage plants and not flowering plants, because flowering ones need more sunlight, she says. Vandhana cautions not over water the plants. Water them the plants on alternate days, she says, because over watering may cause fungal diseases in the roots of the plants and trees indoors.Govind, Urban Orchid BoutiqueLightweight Expanded Clay Aggregate or LECA is the way to go, according to Govind. This is semi- hydroponic structure supports easy plant and tree growth without the soil, therefore no messy spots. Sansevieria trifasciata, more popularly known as mother-in-law plants, are easy to grow indoors in colder climates. It is said to remove 4-5 toxins in the air and produce more oxygen at nights, making the plant ideal for bedrooms and living rooms, says Govind. He also recommends various types of Orchids. ""Phalaenopsis or moth orchids are very common in the U.S. And so are the Paphiopedilums. Throw in a mix of various colors and you will have a fully bloomed garden for a minimum of 60 days"", he says.Dipali, Grace PottersDipali says that we dont use cocopeat enough, though India is one of its largest exporters. Any soil has an expiry date, she says, we need to keep on replenishing it with manure. The soil will eventually lose its strength but coco peat absorbs about 10 times more water than soil and can easily sustain big indoor trees like palms and orchids with it. Also people look at big things like equipment and interior landscaping but dont check the smaller details like holes in the pots, which could drain the water and leave the soil dry. Indoor trees need at least 1-2 hours of direct or 4-5 hours of diffused sunlight daily. The horticulturist suggests Anthuriums and palms such as Flame Thrower, Slender lady, Chinese fan and ruffled fan. ""Cactus with flowers are also a good indoor options, she says."

As we travel through the rickety roads of Shollinganallur, we reach our destination  HLC International School and directly land in the mini garden located right behind the campus. Soaking in the Sun, a bunch of young children mixing clay and mud, some observing the growth of the planted seeds, while some jumping in what looks like a natural make-shift trampoline made of dried leaves, within the garden are our first take away as we observe the scene. But no, this isnt an eco-friendly play park we are talking about.Students jump in the naturaltrampoline of compostLike two other schools in the city (Ramana Vidyalaya at Shollinganallur, Tattva School, Polachery) HLC International has tied up with Grow Your Own Veggies, a nonprofit organisation, the brainchild of Alladi Mahadevan, to promote sustainability and provide hands-on learning sessions and guidance on how to foster sustainable living to children and parents. As the school is gearing up for an exhibition on different branches of sustainable models of organic gardening and organic farming on January 20 and 21, City Express walks through the organic trail to learn more.As we trace the work of the students through the trail, Upasna, Dharini and Gayathri, three class IX students, take us around. Most of us waste money and resources in the second part of our lives on hospital bills, mainly because of soil contamination. Its important to have nutritious soil. It gives us water, food and shelter, says Gayathri, as she points to the patch of land, adapting a sun ray formation of farming. Through this method there is an optimal usage of land and water. And we are using a triad arrangement in this system, she explains.The compost pit on one patch forms the sun with rays of plants radiating out, while a live pond becomes the sun in another.Following five main themes of sustainable models here: organic farming, organic gardening, living soil, natural building and traditional cooking, the students have worked tediously, opine the teachers.Going by a strict no-chemicals mantra, the students have grown 25 varieties of paddy, 26 varieties of millets, nine kinds of greens, 60 herbs, oilseeds, beans, gourds, greens, root vegetables, tomatoes, chilies, fruits, and flowers. All these have been grown from native seeds and indigenous saplings fully organically, without the use of any kind of chemical additives, says Mahadevan.Here the students of the school not only learn to work with soil, irrigation, harvesting and sowing, but constantly apply the exercises in other subjects as well. Confused? We learn everything from math, sociology, and physics through what we do here. This is connected academically and we relate to most of these exercises while we learn the curriculum in other subjects, shares Dharini. The students learn about pressure, measurements, crop cycles and other aspects as they work their way in establishing a sustainable eco system within the campus.As the work to make the mixture of a clay wall is happening in full throttle on one side, a bunch of sixth graders jump on a four feet deep natural compost pit on the other, calling it an au natural trampoline! Inviting us inside the pit, which has layers of twigs, dry leaves, top soil and mainly a mixture of amritakaraisal  a mixture of rotten fruits, jaggery, cow dung and cow urine, a student shares, This is a community composting set up an is a rich reservoir of life and nutrition that spreads gradually into the surrounding areas through the action of earthworms and other organisms.From learning and discussing nitrogen fixation, organisms, microorganisms and optimisation, the children have good knowledge of sustainability, which they intend to share with schools, government and other organisation in upcoming exhibition, Sashwatham."

She cited that the vegetables in the village were way much cheaper than in Sambalpur city.In the village, potato was being sold at Rs 5 per kg, one and half kg of tomato for Rs 10, drum sticks for Rs 20 and cabbage for Rs 3 per kg. On the other hand, potato is selling for Rs 8 a kilo, tomato Rs 10 per kg and drum sticks Rs 35 per kg in the city.A view of the vegetable market in Sambalpuron Saturday | ExpressWhile traders attribute the difference in prices to transportation and porter cost besides levy imposed by Regulated Market Committees, failure of authorities concerned to rein in the vendors seems to have led the farmers to such a situation.The tall promises made by the BJD Government to provide 35 per cent irrigation in each block besides cold storage across the State remain unfulfilled. Blame it on the indifference of the administration which has left the vegetable growers and farmers at the mercy of vendors, who never fail to exploit them.The prices of vegetables were much lower a week ago and began rising with the rise in mercury level.Green chilli, which is available at Rs 24 per kg in the village, is sold at Rs 40 in town and city markets, tomato is priced at Rs 120 for 25 kg (Rs 4.80 a kg) and sold at Rs 10 per kg, brinjal around Rs 6 against market price of Rs 10 to Rs 12 per kg, cucumber is sold by farmers at Rs 15 per kg while it costs Rs 20 in the market. On the other hand, there is a margin of Rs 10 in one kg of coriander leaves which is purchased at Rs 30 and sold at Rs 40, beans are priced at Rs 20 and sold at Rs 30.But, the summer vegetables of pointed gourd (potal) and ladies finger are expensive as of now with pointed gourd being sold by farmers at Rs 70 a kg. The same is sold between Rs 90 and Rs 120, ladies finger is sold in open market at Rs 50 per kg while farmers are selling it at Rs 30 per kg.It is the cabbage growers who have been badly hit with many failing to recover even the harvesting cost. A bag containing 40 kg cabbage is available for Rs 100 even as it is being sold at Rs 6 per kg in the open market, while cauliflower is being purchased from growers at Rs 12 to Rs 14 and sold by vendors at Rs 20.Onion growers too are crying tears of neglect. In Titlagarh, the Nashik of Odisha, distress sale was reported. Although it has been two years since an integrated pack house was developed by APICOL, mere transfer of land to install the transformer to electrically charge the pack house has denied the onion growers to stock their produce and sell it when prices soar."

There are common myths associated with food allergies which needs to be addressed.Myth 1: Food allergy is very commonFact: Although 25 percent of people think theyre allergic to certain foods, studies show that about only eight percent of children and two percent of adults have food allergy.Myth 2: Most people with food allergies are allergic to oranges and tomatoesFact: Although people can be allergic to any kind of food, most food allergies are caused by nuts, cows milk, eggs, soy, fish, and shellfish.Myth 3: Some people are allergic to sugar and fatsFact: A condition is called a food allergy when the immune system fights against a certain protein in a food. This doesnt happen with sugar and fats.Myth 4: Milk allergy is very common in adultsFact: Milk allergy is much more common in children than in adults. Most children outgrow the allergy by the time they are six years old. Symptoms of milk allergy include hives, vomiting, and breathing problems after eating or drinking a dairy product. Some adults have trouble digesting the sugar in milk. This is called lactose intolerance. It isnt a true allergy. Symptoms of lactose intolerance are bloating, cramping, nausea, gas, and diarrhea.Myth 5: People with food allergies are allergic to many foodsFact: Most people with food allergies are allergic to fewer than four foods. Its important to test for food allergy and confirm this as its important not to stop all foods just based on some symptoms as growing children need all food.Myth 6: Allergy to food dye is commonFact: Natural foods cause the most allergic reactions. Studies have found that some food additives, such as yellow dye No.5 and aspartame (brand name: NutraSweet), cause problems in some people.Myth 7: Food allergy is either lifelong or is always outgrownFact: Children usually outgrow allergies to milk, eggs, soybean products, and wheat. But people usually do not outgrow allergies to nuts, fish, and shellfish.Myth 8: Food allergy is not dangerousFact: Food allergy can be fatal if it is severe enough to cause a reaction called anaphylaxis .This reaction makes it hard for a person to breathe. Fast treatment with a medicine called epinephrine can save your life. If you or your child have a severe allergy, your doctor might give you a prescription for epinephrine self-injection pens.Myth 9:Food allergy is a clinical diagnosisFact : Diagnosis of food allergy depends on a good history, demonstration of sensitation objectively via skin prick testing or serum specific IgE and confirmation of food allergy via double blind placebo controlled food challenge. Consult pediatric allergist for proper evaluation."

Her mother was diagnosed with lung cancer and was given four and a half months to live, and thats when Kalpana started an organic kitchen.I believed that she contracted the cancer from the chemicals inside our body, which come from the food we consume. I decided to have my own and organic kitchen-garden, so that my family will not have to consume pesticide-laced vegetables from the market she says.Baby StepsHer first patch of garden was in a plot at Chilkur and Kalpana continues to nurture it.Her terrace garden is just seven-months-old. From potatoes, tomatoes, radish and gourds to basil, ginger, lemon grass and grapes, her terrace garden at Gachibowli (Hyderabad) is a delight. Interestingly, this IT hub has a rocky terrain.Her backyard also has banana trees and ornamental plants, which keep the surroundings fresh and cool. Pests pose the biggest challenge for her.I use neem oil or neem cakes and paste of chili powder, turmeric and garlic to keep them out, she says. It is important to understand how much sun your plants need because each terrace is different.Kalpana says the best is to keep the garden natural, with honeybees and birds for pollination and controlling pest populations.For watering the plants, I use pitcher irrigation, she says, which does not waste water. She has also used lessons she caught on YouTube, such as planting onions in jars or pots placed at a height from the ground. This keeps out ground pests... It is called upside down gardening, she says."

Yet to recover from the crop loss of 2015-16 kharif season, they were forced to go for distress sale of cabbage, tomato and chilli and now it is the turn of potato.The farmers had put all their hopes on potato and looked forward to make up for the loss. Even as potato is being sold for `8 per kg in the open market, the farmers are finding it difficult to even recover the cost of cultivation with traders offering anything between `2 and `3 per kg. In the absence of cold storage, the farmers have no way out but to dispose of the produce at throw away prices.Moreover, the State Government is yet to fix the minimum support price (MSP) for potato despite tall claims of Potato Mission. To make things worse there is no organised market to ensure fair price to the farmers.Under Potato Mission, besides providing incentivised potato seed, the State Government had also committed to give capital subsidy for new cold storage as per the agricultural policy of 2013. It was also mooting subsidising power tariff for existing and new cold storages till March 31, 2018.Plans were also sketched to maintain buffer stock to deal with short-term scarcity situation and a target has been set to bring 60,000 hectares of land under potato cultivation by 2017-18. But, on the ground the picture is not rosy. This year, the Department of Horticulture had distributed 5350 quintal potato seeds to 29 farmers in Bhatli, Bargarh and Attabira blocks.The seeds were meant to produce 424 quintal of potato. This apart, about 500 quintal of seeds were procured from open market and cultivated by farmers across the district. As the situation stands today, many farmers have resorted to distress sale of potato while many are refusing to harvest it as they want to avoid further losses.Premanand Dang of Jamurda village in Bargarh block had cultivated potato over half an acre of land. But, he has no purchaser and is forced to sell his produce at distress prices.Those who had taken debt for the crop were the first to sell their crop at `3 per kg in absence of any organised market in the district. Similar is the condition of Rajkumar Pradhan of the village, who is not daring to harvest his crop in absence of market. Even if he harvests the crop, the amount he would be getting for the produce would not be enough to recover the harvesting cost.Assistant Horticulture Officer, Sunil Kumar Seth said no communication has been received from the State Government on MSP of potato. There was no cold storage in the district and said if farmers wish they can avail the facility in Sambalpur, he added."

Tomato prices touched a high of Rs 42 a kg at vegetable stores in the city on Tuesday. However, it isnt just tomatoes, but other vegetables too whose prices have begun to climb and are expected to become more expensive when summer sets in.In the case of tomato, prices will have to increase as most of the tomatoes sold are coming from Nagpur, said a vegetable store owner who did not wish to be named. It takes around six days for these tomatoes to reach Chennai as they go to Bengaluru first and then come here. The demand for tomatoes is always high and the supply is getting limited, so prices have to go up.He said he was charging Rs 38 for a kg of tomatoes on Monday but since prices increased by Rs 5 at the Koyambedu vegetable market on Tuesday, he had spiked his rate to Rs 42. He explained that the difference in prices at retail and Koyambedu wholesale market is generally around Rs 4 to Rs 5 less a kg for things like tomatoes and can go up to Rs eight to Rs 10 less in the case of vegetables like beans.Vegetable vendors affirmed that most other vegetables have been hovering around the same prices with minor fluctuation. However, they warned that with the beginning of summer, prices too will go up. They attributed this to different reasons, primary one being the water problem in the State.Water shortage will definitely lead to prices being higher this summer, said S Mani, a vegetable vendor at T. Nagar. Prices of vegetables like ladies finger, especially will keep increasing as it is one of the most commonly bought vegetables in summer.He sold the vegetable at Rs 70 per kg on Tuesday. Prices of onion and potato, however, have remained stable. A kilo of onion can be bought for Rs 18-Rs 20 while a kilo of potato is priced Rs 25."

Varghese Vallikkatt received a visitor.His name was George James (name changed). In his early thirties, George was out on bail, after spending five years on a murder charge.George told me that he had been falsely accused, says Fr. Varghese. Now the woman who said she was a witness to the murder has recanted her statement during the ongoing trial. There is a good chance that he will be set free.Fr. George KurukkoorGeorge said that he had become more spiritual in prison. After speaking for a little while George left. Many people who come to the POC feel a sense of peace, says Fr. Varghese. The POC has been in the news because it celebrated its golden jubilee recently. The centre houses the representatives of the three main churches of the Catholic community, namely the Syro-Malankara, the Syro-Malabar and Latin rites. In Kerala, the Catholics comprise about 55 lakh people. The POC has an important mission of bringing all the churches together, says Mar Cardinal George Alencherry. Incidentally, it is also the secretariat of the Kerala Catholic Bishops Council.The idea to set up the Centre came following the second Vatican Council (1962-65), which propagated the idea of the universal church being a community of individual local churches. And the Palarivattom POC got a big push by the late Cardinal Joseph Parecatill who was an ardent supporter of the Indianisation of the church.At the centre, there are 21 Commissions, comprising priests and lay people, which look after subjects like justice, development, youth, labour, health, education, family, and social harmony. Apart from that, regular seminars and conferences take place.We discuss matters connected with our faith and the relationship with the larger society, says Fr. Varghese. What should be our contribution? And what should be our mission at this particular time?Sometimes, there are soul-searching discussions. There have been recurring criticism by the laity about our work in education and health care, and of our institutions becoming commercialised and competing with others, says Fr. Varghese. We had a lot of discussions about our role. And we concluded that we should continue to be involved in educational and health-care, but our mission should be to serve the poorest of the poor.Following the arrest of Fr Robin Vaddakumchiryil, the vicar of the St Sebastian church at Kottiyoor, on sexual abuse charges, there were deliberations on how to ensure a safe environment for minors and vulnerable adults alike.The POC is a good place to have talks thanks to its sprawling campus spread over four-and-a-half acres. There is a main administrative block, a chapel, a residential building for visiting Bishops and priests, a canteen, and a block for the womenfolk.Interestingly, at the back, the priests are growing tomatoes, small gourds, cabbage, cauliflower and bananas. A gaggle of geese, turkeys and ducks can be seen, apart from hens, an emu and a Doberman. At one side, the POC and the Vediyoor Madom Temple share a wall, while on another, it is with the Madavana Panchamoorthi Temple.Asked whether the increasing siege on minorities is a source of worry, Fr. Varghese says, It is a challenging and difficult time, especially in North India. We are a peace-loving people, who have contributed much more to society than the size of our population. But we value as much the union and the solidarity with other communities.The Official Translator Of The ChurchEvery morning, Fr. George Kurukkoor enters a first-floor room at the Pastoral Orientation Centre at Kochi and sits behind a table. There are several glass-paned bookcases on all sides. These contain books in Greek, Sanskrit, Latin, Portuguese, Urdu, Persian, Malayalam, Hindi, and Spanish.There are 46 dictionaries, apart from grammar books of various languages, as well as religions like Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, Jainism and Christianity. Fr. George is the official translator of the Catholic Church in Kerala. And he dips into the books in his library when he is in search of a wood or a phrase. The types of books that I have translated include those dealing with social justice, catechism, the Bible, morals, and constitutions of institutions.The Kerala Catholic Bishops Council selects the books to be translated. According to the Council, all the documents coming from Rome must be translated into Malayalam, and given to the people to read, says Fr. George. But it is not an easy task. A 300-page book in Latin can take three months. That is because I am translating from an Indo-European language to the Dravidian language, says Fr. George. The two families are quite different, so the exact style cannot be retained.Generally, a play of words, old sayings, and unusual grammatical sentences are avoided. If the source language is of the same family, translation is easier. So, Latin to English is easy, while Latin to Malayalam is difficult. So far, Fr George has translated 200 books in 27 years of non-stop work. On any given day, he begins at 8 a.m., and works non-stop - with breaks for lunch, tea, an evening walk and dinner - till 11.30 p.m."

Informing about the concept, head of Rourkela-based Sundargarh-II Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), J Pati, said farmers are provided with financial and technical support to take up cultivation.He said to get good returns, farmers would have to plan cultivation in tune with market demands and the market led agriculture extension programme is a feasible option. Many farmers in the district are resorting to off season cultivation of vegetables in protected environment of poly-houses or shed-net structures and are reaping benefits.It is learnt that under National Horticulture Mission, the Horticulture department is offering heavy subsidy to set up poly-house and shed net structures, while KVK is engaged in providing technical knowhow.Deputy Director, Horticulture (DDH) Basudev Sahu said the popularity of poly-house and shed net structures is slowly picking up. Assistant Horticulture Engineer Alok Adhikari said the district has about four poly-houses over 2,500 sq m and nearly 20 shed-net units over 24,000 sq m. Five shed-net units at Kirei cover 8,000-9,000 sq m.These units through organic farming are successfully producing flowers and major vegetables including cauliflower, cabbage, coloured capsicum, cucumber and banana.A poly-house owner SP Jena said he produces about 20 kg of cherry tomato alone. KVKs horticulture scientist Sanjay Pradhan said during off season, poly-houses are successfully growing seedlings in protected environment, but the shed-net units have their own disadvantages during rainy season."

After working in a royal kitchen for nine years, he moved to the hospitality sector. This is the second time Singhs Rajasthani food festival is being hosted at Bengaluru Marriott Whitefield.From the land of the Maharajas comes 15 dishes that have a range of flavours  sweet, spicy and the many stops in between. The rich cuisine is generous with ghee, yogurt and spices.For the starters, I had Murg Ka Parche and Rai Ki Machli, both are tender and have a distinct flavour. The fish is seasoned with mustard and the Tandoori chicken breasts have a crusty garlicky flavour. Paneer Ke Suley, Dal Pakodi and Mangodi Ki Tikki are hot, soft and filling. The Dahi Vada is fresh and minty.The main course has 11 dishes. Laal Maas, which translates to red meat, is one of the most popular dishes. It is mutton curry cooked in a sauce of curd and spicy red chillies. There is little or no use of tomatoes, just a bit of onions and coriander powder.The traditional Laal Maas shows how Rajasthani cuisine is shaped by spices more than anything else. The red chillies are supplied from a village called Mathonia, about 20 km from Jodhpur. Another dish that stood out was Ker Sangri, made from shoots of a desert plant Khejari. It grows only once a year, during spring time. This is more a pickle with its tangy natural flavour.In Ghatte Ki Subji and Ghatte Ki Pulao, dumplings are made from besan and cooked in a curd gravy. Subz Panchmela is a mix of five sauted vegetables - carrots, cabbage, beans, green peas and spinach.At the end of the line stands a dessert bar. Crunchy, juicy jalebis are also served.

Also, if you are lucky like me, you might even witness a flash mob by the staff on Bollywood chartbusters.Despite the menu sporting dhaaba food, the lip smacking dishes and cocktails are anything but street side and is definitely up in style and Punjabi flavours. Chef Shivam Bose introduced us to the menu that included Paneer Tikka, Veg Galouti and Tandoori Bhune Aloo as starters for vegetarians. For mains, you can pick from Dal Dhaba, Paneer Makhani and Amritsari Chole along with choice of two breads from the menu between Roti, Butter Naan, Lachha Paratha and Naan.For non vegetarian starters, choose from Highway Chicken Tikka, Tawa Mutton and Tawa Chicken. For the mains, pick from Butter Chicken, Rarra Ghost, Kadhai Chicken and Dal Dhaba along with choice of two breads from the menu between Roti, Butter Naan, Lachha Paratha and Naan. For sweet endings, go for some rabri, gulab jamun and phirni.For the Chaat FlavourIf you love chaat flavours, I would recommend you to order Tandoori Bhune Aloo and Paneer Tikka. The paneer cuts through smoothly and is tempered very well with spices. The Bhune Aloo are roasted baby potatoes, tossed in spices and served beautifully with onions and tomatoes. Two of my favourite things  potatoes and tomatoes  put together with roasted flavours and tempered with chaat. Was I a happy woman? Damn, right.While I have heard of Galouti Kebab, I had always perceived as a non vegetarian dish. But here, thanks to chef Shivam, I got a taste of its vegetarian version, where just like the meat one, the vegetable is minced to smoothness through slow cooking, flavoured with cinnamon and black cardamom and placed over a maida crispy base. The galouti is buttery smooth and the base adds the crunch to this dish.The non-vegetarian version of the galouti had lamb minced and cooked to buttery smoothness. The chef definitely earned respect on the dinner table having cooked the meat so well. The effort of the kitchen and its use of technique shows beautiful with this starter.Be it the medium rare Mutton Seekh, the Amritsari Machli or vegetarian starters, the kitchen at Dhaba by Claridges has got its flavours and cooking technique right on the money.The Chitta Butter Chicken is served with white sauce. Flavoured in kasoori methi, this dish is cooked in tandoor with the marination of hung curd and spices. The meat is well cooked and bursts of zesty flavours.The Balti Meat is the houses signature dish, which steals inspiration from the famous mutton curry of dhaba. The curry has all the flavours of a Punjabi house kitchen. Although the gravy looks spicy, at no point do any of the favours overpower the centre-piece sticking out of the bucket serving bowl  the mutton.The Tawa Mutton Pulao has flaky Basmati rice that is tossed in spices and tempered with spices that you will find in any Punjabi kitchen. The dish is light on the stomach and has a fresh mint garnish with well cooked meat pieces. If you are a rice fanatic, do give this one a try.Gujju Dreams Come TrueBeing a Gujarati, I had to ask for the Kadi Pakora, and boy, was I impressed. The thick curd-flour consistency, flavoured well with turmeric and spices, served with pakoras drenched in the gravy won my heart. I definitely missed home a little less with this preparation that is famous across North India.While theres so much to talk about the food, one place where Dhaba by Claridges proves its versatility is the cocktails. They are all flavoured with chaat spices and my God, are the one of the most impressive mixes I have had so far."

At least 30 different innovations in the sector are stuck, pending approvals from the government.While the retail value of the Indian bio-economy is estimated at $35 billion, projects in the agri-biotech industry have failed to receive an impetus.According to data available with the Association of Biotech Led Industries (ABLE), the retail value of bio agri sector sums up to $9.015 billion, out of which $9 billion is accounted for by commercialisation of Bt cotton alone, with no representation of innovation in any other crops, as licences have not been granted for their field testing.The ABLE Agriculture (Able-Ag) has urged the government to relax policy norms, as companies are finding it hard to get approvals for field testing of their innovations.The Centre had mandated organisations to secure no-objection certificates (NOCs) from the respective state governments and in majority of the cases, approvals were being denied, mostly because of a threat perception about Bt crops, according to members of the association.The government needs to open it up for testing, at the very least. Unless these innovations can be tested for their safety, how can the safety concerns around Bt crops be addressed? asked Shivendra Bajaj, executive director, Able-Ag.The projects awaiting approvals include innovations developed by Indian Institute ofHorticulture Research, Sugarcane Breeding Research Institute, Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture, apart from several private companies with regard to crops such as cotton, maize, mustard, corn, sugarcane, papaya and tomato among others.Giving a glimpse into the situation, he said things were getting worse for the technology year-on-year, for the past five-six years.The irony is that much of the data generated in India is being made of use of by other countries. Countries such as Bangladesh, which entered the field much later, are now making use of Bt innovations in agriculture. Every year, they are slowly increasing the cultivation of Bt brinjal. Pakistan has commercialised Bt maize after testing it for several years. In India, it is still pending even though we started testing it way earlier, Bajaj said.As for the safety concerns, Bajaj said India imported edible oils generated from Bt crops in other countries, while back home there was apprehension about allowing the development of these crops."

Among flowering plants, different kinds of roses such as button, white, red, yellow and chrysanthemums, hibiscus, and others dot the place.The snake gourd in their terrace garden (left) Sailaja Prakash (Top) Sai Prakash  Vinay MadapuAmong vegetable plants, tomato, brinjal, green chilli, snake gourd, gherkins, okra, cabbage, coriander, spinach, fenugreek, cucumber, and more greet the eyes.Speaking on the care being taken for the plants, Sai Prakash says, We only use cowdung and vermicompost as fertilisers, and Gomutra for pest management.With summer bearing down, the duo have installed a shade net across the entire length of the terrace. It certainly works. One does not feel the heat standing under the net.While not tending plants, Sai Prakash works as a business analyst in a software company.On future plans, Sai Prakash says he is exploring the idea of setting up aquaponics on his terrace, where fish are grown alongside plants. The waste produced by fish would supply the needed ingredients for the plantsgrowth.(If you have any questions or gardening tips, feel free to contact Sai Prakash at 9849735895)"

When the paper is planted in a pot of soil or outside in a garden, the seeds in the paper germinate and grow into plants with the paper turning into compost leaving behind a variety of flora, zero waste and human footprints.The calendar was officially released by Mayor Soumini Jain by handing over a copy to Hamsakunju, former Mayor on Wednesday. She also planted the first page of the calendar.The seed paper calendar is embedded with the seeds of various indigenous vegetables and flowers including sunflower, tomato and red amaranthus (cheera) among others. After each month, the owner can tear each page and plant it on a pot of soil.Detailed instructions on planting the paper are provided on the front page of the calendar. It should be followed accurately and sufficient care should be given to each paper just like planting normal seeds. After 12 months, the calendar would completely disappear into the soil and 12 different seeds will sprout in your garden. Even the design on the calendar has been done in the image of a green leaf which will remind you to adhere to environmentally friendly development strategySince its inception, KMRL has strived to be more than an organization which creates modern infrastructure in the city. It believes in the vision of a Kochi that is not just futuristic but also environment-friendly. The seed paper calendar is one of the many initiatives designed and implemented to achieve this goal, said KMRL managing director Elias George."

Well, summer is back, with the mercury hitting new highs since the first week of the month and humidity melting us all into a puddle. And March is not even over! It is going to get worse with the massive loss of tree cover in the city, thanks to Vardah that stormed into the city with a vengeance. CE reporters and photographers take a walk through Chennais hot-spots (pun intended) to give you a glimpse of how the city is coping...Juice ItGoing out between 10 am and 5 pm is an indomitable task during summer. While most of us have the luxury of planning our day around the availability of AC rooms and malls, daily wage labourers, and also street vendors toil away in the sun. Those who sell green coconut, fruit juices and freshly cut fruits, provide relief to the commuters and pedestrians, but they themselves have no place to hide from the harsh sun. Fruit juice shops, road-side kamman kuzhu stalls, buttermilk stalls and rickshaws fi lled with green coconut are common in most parts of the city. What better way to beat the heat than to binge drink on these healthy supplements? With `10 a bowl, fruits and juices keep us hydrated and cools down excess body heat.The Beach For Its LoversDuring Chennai veyil, be wary of getting a tan or worse a sun burn! Many youngsters cover their faces with stoles, cotton gloves and dupattas, especially those riding twowheelers. Radiation can cause blisters and rashes on the exposed areas especially the hands, and even dermatologists suggest gloves while riding or even walking in the sun. As we have studied in our primary schools, it is better to wear cotton dresses than nylon or silk, as the latter might stick to the body because of excessive sweating during summer and cause irritation. Talking about suntans, most today have veered towards natural remedies such as rose-water-lime, turmeric-lime and tomato juice-lime. As the temperature increases, the chances of a sun burn are high. Make sure to cool down as quickly as possible. Keep yourself hydrated, and moisturise the area while its damp and consult a doctor for help at the earliest to avoid severe infections.No Bliss, But Blisters!We Chennaiites dont need a weather update to know that summer is fast approaching. Though many of us prefer to stay indoors, its tradition to visit our beaches  from Marina to Bessy and beyond. Well, defi nitely not to show off the summer bod, but to take a refreshing dip, a quick stroll along the warm sand shore and stopping for some mang-kadalai, sugarcane juice and fresh fruits, later! Even at noon, under the hot sun, our beaches seem crowded with people taking shelter under the carts and kattamarams. But as heat-humidity becomes more oppressive, beaches do get deserted with fewer beach lovers and couples.Time To HyderateAnimals and birds in our neighbourhood too need some clean and fresh water. I am sure every summer, we might have seen birds drink the tiny drops of water that leak from taps or dogs and cats drink from street gutters. Why not help these animals cool down a bit? This summer, collect some water in a clean bowl and leave it on your terrace and outside your gate for your feathered and four-legged friends. This might help them quench their thirst from time to time. Dogs and cats are usually on the look-out to rest in cool shady places; make place for them under your car or your garage. If you own a dog or a cat, and decide to take them along with you for some grocery shopping, DO NOT lock them up in the car with the windows open or closed, they may lose their lives because of the heat trapped within. Avoid taking them out for a walk when the heat is at its peak. Give your dog a trim and brush their fur regularly; it helps them stay cool. For your caged pets, like hamsters, birds, and squirrelsleave their cages in a low-sun area. Let all our pawpals, petpals and community animals and birds have a safe and happy summer!"

His interest in gardening began when he was young, but three months ago, his friends encouraged him to set up a terrace garden. Those few days, it was even hard to get out to buy vegetables. Thats when this idea came about, says the 24-year-old.He has a sprawling terrace garden with a variety of vegetables, fruits and spices. Now I have different variety of spinach, ladies finger, Thai basil, cinnamon, chillies, brinjal, bayleaf, pomegranate and more, he says.An encounter with Bernard D Clerke, a naturalist in Puducherry, helped him learn more about organic farming. The amount of soil in my pots is very less.Instead I use dry leaves- the blackened ones, which turn to soil on decomposing. So in my pots, it's 1/3 of soil and 2/3 of dry leaves. Because of this I dont have to change the soil frequently as the nutrients required for the plants stay intact, he explains.Winston also conducted experiments of his own to understand why dry leaves are important. I had two pots of brinjal. While in one I used coconut husk along with soil, in the other it was with dry leaves. The latter was fresher, he shares. He collects the dry leaves from the poongam tree and neem tree right outside his house.With the city having water shortage, the dry leaves also help in less consumption. The soil is covered with a 15cm bed of dry leaves. I water the plants every morning, the dry leaves absorbs them and keeps the soil moist till the evening, he says.Winston shares that it is important to invite insects as that also helps in plant growth. While small insects can harm the plants, he has a homemade disinfectant for the plants.I make a concoction with turmeric, vasambu (Calamus) and neem leaves. I purchase turmeric sticks and grind them along with vasambu. At home, I boil the neem leaves in water and make it into a concentrated solution. For every 300ml of the solution I add 10 litres of water and the ground powder and pour it over all plants. As both neem and turmeric are good disinfectants they kill the tiny insects that harm the plants, he explains.Winstons friends help him acquire good quality seeds. While this is the first time he has planted so many trees, for the past year he has consumed ladies finger and tomatoes grown at his home. Now, his neighbours are also inspired by him and have started planting trees on the terrace."

Among the ones served here, the tomato tartare is a better choice than its chicken counterpart. Double cooked with mozarella and served with black olive powder, the tartare is delicate.The Free-range Chicken had a unique combination of bell peppers and pecorino romano cheese ice cream. The lightly sweet ice cream with a cheese-like taste is a suprising twist because you dont expect your dessert to sit on the appetisers. But it goes well together.Shrimp -- oven baked and roasted -- are served with white spring onion cream and black truffle, they are a must try. The baked shrimp has a strong orange flavour and the roasted is crispy. The cream of white onions lends the dish a sweet and sour flavour.After the Antipasti is served the Primi Piatti, which is essentially pasta. The lemon foam adds a tanginess to the Fagottini pasta served with burrata, lobster and green peas.The parmigiano reggiano (a hard, granular cheese) aged 24 months is a perfect match for the ravioli. It looks fancy but tastes familiar, like it is homemade. The tomatoes add a zing to the morel mushrooms, green peas and asparagus.Secondi Piatti, another mains, has chicken breast and thigh, spinach, wild mushrooms and pumpkin with rosemary, sauce saracena moscato looks exciting but falls flat with the meat cooked in mushroom sauce rubbery.The sea bass tastes fresh. The platter also includes potatoes prepared in saffron sauce. All good here.Finally, the desserts, or as Italians call it Dolci, include Tiramasu Parfait and Citrus Tart, Cream and Nuts. The chef special Tiramasu is highly recommended, with its overpowering coffee flavour. As you dig into the Tiramisu, the cream oozes out. There is a hint of chocolate.As the name suggests, the tart has a strong citrusy flavour from the layers of lemon cream. It is topped with fruits and nuts. The strawberry is a great add-on, softening the otherwise acidic and sharp flavour of lemon.The reviewed dishes were part of the Capri to Calabria, Southern Italian food festival, which closed on March 24. But, few of them will be included in the restaurants main menu in the coming weeks."

The farmer was first admitted to District Headquarters Hospital at Jajpur town and was later shifted to SCB Medical College and Hospital (SCBMCH) in Cuttack after his condition deteriorated. He is now battling for life at the SCB, sources said.District Collector Ranjan Kumar Das, accompanied by Project Director, DRDA, Braj Gopal Acharya, Sub-Collector Narayan Chandra Dhal, Deputy Director of Agriculture Rajib Lochjan Das, Jajpur Tehsildar Laxmi Narayan Misra and local BDO Haris Chandra Jena visited the village on Friday for an inquiry.During investigation, Kalingas family members and villagers told the investigating team that the young farmer had cultivated tomato, chilli and other vegetables on three acres of land, including 1.5 acres on share-cropping basis. Kalinga had borrowed around `50,000 from his relatives and taken around `1 lakh loan from other private moneylenders at high interest for the crop.But, he was unable to repay the money due to distress sale and crop damage after the untimely rain. The family members claimed that Kalinga was under severe stress due to loan burden following pressure from the moneylenders.The Collector said Kalinga is the sole bread winner of the family as his elder brother is mentally challenged and his father is old. As Kalinga could not return the money to his relatives, the latter informed his father. There was a heated exchange of words between father and son following which an aggrieved Kalinga attempted suicide.Moreover, untimely rain and distress sale were also the contributing factors, Das added.The district administration has given `10,000 to the victims father Prafulla from Red Cross fund for treatment. The Collector has deputed two officials to SCB Medical and has also assured to provide more money from Red Cross to meet the treatment expenses."

No one has the time. They just come, order, get their snacks packed and leave to reach office on time. It is a different experience.The outlet opened about two months ago. Sujata Chittiapa, another managing partner says, We studied the station for two months. We observed the crowd that came in. After the connectivity to Mysuru Road, the crowd has increased and it turned out to be better for us.The eatery is open from 9 am to 10.30 pm, until the last train arrives.Goutom claims that the footfall per day is about 1,800 to 2,000. On week days, there are office goers. On weekends, it is usually less as most of them would be families and those who are on joy rides. We earn about Rs 7-9 lakh a month and we pay a rent to BMRCL of about Rs 1.15 lakh, he says.The outlet serves snacks such as vada pav, sandwiches, dahi vada, cakes and hot beverages - tea and coffee.They would soon be including different varieties of tea too.Topped with boondi, their dahi vada is as fresh as it can get. Dipped in a sea of curd, the vada is moist and melts in your mouth as soon as you take a bite.He says, Our specialities are sandwiches, dahi vada, vada pav and cutlets. There are three Mumbaikaars who come here every weekend to have our vada pav. They say this is the closest to the one they get in Mumbai. And it truly does tastes like an authentic Mumbai Vada pav.All items except the bakery confectionaries that includes puff are prepared in batches in their centralised kitchen in C V Raman Nagar, which is just half a kilometre away from the station, he says.Sujata adds, We make food in batches of 30. Once, the items get over. We inform the cooks and within half an hour, a new batch arrives. They are also priced reasonably. The bakery items are outsourced from our friend who owns a bakery.Sujata adds, I am also a dietician. I have always been connected to the food industry. We do not pre-mix sugar in our tea or coffee as there might be some customers who are diabetics too. We provide them sugar separately. Some complain about it while some prefer it.Particular about the hygiene, Goutom challenges, You can walk in to our kitchen anytime without any prior notice and see the hygiene we maintain.If you are a cheese fan, you should definitely try their tomato and cheese sandwich."

Garden enthusiast and the city-based Bharatanatyam exponent Revathi Ramachandran says that having a terrace garden helps in beating the heat, significantly! As we walk through her terrace garden, next to her dance-rehearsal hall, she says, Its wonderful to have a garden so close to the place where you dance. Sometimes my students help me in watering the plants and we even have small fun activities along with rehearsals. And the little ones? They love to eat the mint leaves! she laughs.As we cross the dance hall and open the door to the terrace garden, a gentle fragrance of basil, tulsi, kanakambaram and mint envelops us. Look at those fresh tomatoes! exclaims Revathi. What started as an experiment, gardening became a passion for the danseuse in 2016. It was in early 2016... I had been to an exhibition in Kalakshetra and brought home a gardening kit. It had seed samples of tomatoes and brinjal and thats how I started growing my own veggies, she says. After the first tomato plant flowered, an excited and thrilled Revathi began to grow flowering plants along with fruit-bearing ones. Now she had chilies, capsicum, papaya, ladies finger and avarakai, among others. I use veggies from my garden for cooking and most of the flowers are used to decorate the idols of Gods and Goddesses,she says.With guidance from a neighbour  Sumitra and, Prabhu, who runs a solar nursery in Mandeveli  Revathi set up an elaborate terrace garden. As a child, I remember having a huge garden with big coconut and mango trees, and a big malli poo pandhal. It is difficult to have such sprawling gardens when you are living in apartments, but even a small space is enough to have your own green space and thats the need of the hour! she says, smiling.Revathi grooms her plants every other day and she enjoys doing it. I love spending time here, she says, and adds laughing, But, sometimes it becomes unmanageable.Jasmine, Arali, Mana thakali keerai and Nithyakalayani or myrtle are other plants that adorn her garden. Nithyakaluyani is said to be very good for patients with cancer. All you have to do is boil the petals in water and drink the water and its said to do wonders, she says.She uses 100% organic fertilisers. I dont get time to make my own... I buy them... turmeric water, panchagavya, neem oil and ashes we get after doing a homamare very good for the plants and keeps insects away, she says.With a busy schedule throughout the year, how does she find time for her garden? She shares an incident. I was travelling across the country for a dance performance and, when I came back, the few plants I had had withered. No one had watered them and that was the deciding point for me... I knew I had to spend at least a few hours with them every day. Be it rains, the draining heat or even during the infamous Vardha cyclone, Revathi says she makes sure that she protects her garden. I sit here even if its high noon, she says. The plants keeps the place cool."

The raw bananas are from Shivamogga, capsicums from Mandya, tomato from Kolar, beans from Tumkuru, lemons from Chitradurga.The over 8 million Bengalureans buy close to 5,000 tonnes of vegetable in a day. One can however, take to community farming to avoid buying vegetables from far off land.Popular in the West, Community farming is the way of growing food crops collectively by a group of people, for their own consumption either in a private or public place. In the United States such spaces are known as Victoria gardens.The term market garden and gorilla gardens also means community garden.Community gardening is one of the best ways to grow our own food in the urban area. They help build connections between people, nature and their neighbourhood. In community gardening, a group of people from the same community can do gardening in a common place and share the produce.Use Public SpacesPublic places such as parks, government common areas, school premises and temple garden spaces could be converted into community gardens. The growers can collectively share and work on timings that suit them the best. Some community gardens are maintained by paid gardeners who work in the space all day carrying out regular activities such as watering and weeding.Brings Community TogetherThey sow, harvest and engage in other gardening activities with their family members, and friends. This will be a great entertainment as well as they are contributing to the society by producing their own food.The daily need of greens, vegetables, and some fruits can be easily fulfilled with these gardens. Greens can be grown and harvested in a month.Tomatoes, bhindi, brinjal, beans, chillies, capsicum and gourds such as cucumber, pumpkin, snake gourd can be grown easily in the community gardens. It is very simple to grow the vegetables, without any chemicals and pesticides. Enriched soil is the first step of having a healthy plant.Growing marigold plants, mixed crops of herbs and vegetables, companion plants with pulses will aid in growing healthy plants.Community gardens would be a perfect choice for the city folks to grow more from the available spaces.For more information on urban farming and any related queries, please contact the author at nalini@artyplantz.com."

You love coding and building cool system applications no matter how frustrating it gets.Manikanta G with a friend atManyata Tech Park; VasanthKaje at his farmSo, how does a techie beat stress? Well, a few techies in the city have the answer -- getting downright dirty to relieve stress. These Bengalureans have ventured into workplace farming.Nidhi Singh, 28, used to look forward to coffee breaks at work, have a shot of her daily dose of caffeine, but now, it is all about the greens. I have stopped those coffee breaks now and spend time with my plants instead, says the Nokia employee.Freshers on the FarmNidhi grows her favourite vegetables fenugreek and baby corn at a farming plot near her office. Since she has no experience in agriculture, she relies on the Internet to research on what to grow and how. It has been a great experience so far, says the techie who holds a Masters in Computer Application.I had never grown vegetables before. I didnt think I would be able to grow as many vegetables as I have in this small plot, she says. She has reaped her first harvest and says it feels awesome. I harvested spinach and baby corn recently, but I still see it growing well with each passing day as I walk by to work, adds Nidhi.For the Love of Palak PaneerNaveen Kumar Ts love for palak paneer might be one of his inspirations behind growing spinach near his workspace. The IBM employee, who has no prior farming experiences, is also growing ladies finger along with spinach.For Naveen, it is all about building a green consciousness. As pollution takes a toll and with trees being chopped down to make way for concrete structures, he is more than willing to help the environment however he can. I am happy that I have contributed in some way, he says.Savithri Radhakrishnan, a software professional at IBM, believes farming to be a great stress buster. It is not just about work stress, but in general theres a lot going on in everyones life and theres no denying that seeing something grow productively that you have sown makes you feel content and theres a joy in that, she says.Dirt to DestressManikanta G, an employee at Kinapse Ltd, agrees. He recently finished harvesting his produce that he grew outside his office.  I am really happy with my harvest. I got a good yield, says the 28-year-old who works as a regulatory affairs associate.He distributed his produce among colleagues. While he is new to farming, he had always wanted to venture into its organic side.It has been a great journey so far, he says, adding It relaxes me. So, has it brought down the work stress? Yes, a 100 per cent, says Manikanta.Nidhi, who made methi paratha and aloo curry out of her harvest and shared it with colleagues, also credits organic farming at work for relieving her stress. The activity has impacted positively on her emotional health too, she says.Change in PerspectiveMy perspective towards food has changed ever since I started this. I now respect the process of growing food and comprehend the struggle that farmers go through, she adds. Through lessons from her workplace farming, Nidhi now grows saplings in her apartment.Naveen, who has completed his first harvest cycle and is awaiting the next, calls the practice an excellent stress buster. My stress levels have plummeted since I started, he says.Spread across three blocks at Manyata Embassy Business Park, this agricultural land has become a stress buster for employees working in the tech park. The Urban Green initiative was introduced to techies to relieve them of work stress and help them learn about agricultural practices. The primary idea behind this initiative is to provide a low-cost way to give our office parks users the opportunity to go back to the land and incentivise the growing of safe food, says Pradeep Lala, CEO, Embassy Services.So far the employees have harvested spinach, chakotha, coriander, amaranthus, fenugreek, baby corn, brinjal, green chilli, ladies finger and tomato. The project is set to be extended to 250 more plots of 30 sq ft each. The intiative is the brainchild of horticulture manager Kiran DT.Farming BreaksBengaluru-based programmer Shashi, 25 finds going to the fields relaxing. Whenever I go home, I make sure I go to our farm and work there. We grow rice, sugarcane and vegetables, he says.While his breaks for farming arent as frequent as coffee breaks, Shashi does make it a point to have a brief stint at the farm twice a month.Vasanth Kaje, 35, a former senior project manager at Infosys, has now turned a big plot of land back home into farm. He calls it Kaje Vrukshalaya. He took up farming while still working for another IT firm, but quit the job when the balance tilted more towards farming.All tech jobs are aimed at selling better conveniences to humans at the cost of Natures and employees own health. But this comes in various disguises and some are hard to make out. I realised it over a period of time and opted for a return journey to the farmland where I grew up, he says.While Vasanth acknowledges that farming helps him relax he says that it is the duty of every human to grow his or her food. A large section of society leaching a few farmers will eventually lead to the collapse of the system, he adds."

But we are too familiar with the soaked-in-cheese variant and slightly localised taste. In Italy, the wood-fired bread is served with minimal toppings - garlic, herbs, fresh mozzarella and basil on sparsely smeared tomato sauce. And if are interested to take a bite of the real, authentic pizza, head straight to Slice of Italy, the Italian food festival at Hilton Garden Inn. Though a variety of pizzas are available now, the classic Italian pizza is an uncomplicated preparation of a few delicious ingredients, says the chef.Italy has clear-cut concept of meal structure where the diners indulge in an array of dishes in proper succession rather than sticking to a simple one or two courses. So a typical meal starts with minestrone soup, followed by Patate al forno, Spinachi alla Milanese, Spring green risotto, Beef braciole andChicken marsala. It starts with the antipasto (appetizer), to a first course of pasta or other starches, a main dish of meat or fish with a simple side of vegetables, followed by salad, cheese and fruit, coffee, and possibly a digestive, says the chef.He adds that Italian food is a surprisingly diverse cuisine and each of the twenty Italian regions has a distinctive set of flavours, recipes, products, and ingredients. Across all regions, Italian dishes are straightforward preparations of a few choice ingredients, which are artfully combined. Its basically the climate and geography that defines local cuisine, he says. So the creamy risotto is from the Northern regions, while the south boasts of bright olive oil and tomato-based recipes. They make the best beef steaks in Tuscany, from choice cattle raised in the Chianina Valley. There are unique ingredients like truffle mushrooms, special wines, cured meat (salami), and handcrafted cheese. You will also find a wide regional assortment of breads and pastas. Italian breads differ significantly in size, taste, and texture. There are large, chewy loaves and thin, crunchy sticks, he says.Coffee and desserts are definitely part of the meal as the Italians cherish a soft spot for expresso drinks. Gelato Cookies, cakes, pastries, tarts and a lot others are usually enjoyed with coffee. There are some more exotic others like panettone, a buttery egg-bread laced with dried fruit and candied citrus which takes hours to make. Slice of Italy is on till March 26. Walk in anytime between 7 pm and 11 pm."

If you are a fan of meat, try the All Meat Pizza.Topped with chicken salami, grilled chicken, spicy Italian and chicken sausage, the pizza base is layered on the tomato pizza sauce. The bacon pepperoni blends well with the mozzarella cheese. The meaty flavour, soft dough and fresh ham are a delight. The Mexican Ole has a few chicken chunks, which are hard to spot.There are good veggie options as well. Papas Paneer, topped with red onions and green capsicum, has ample soft, golden-fried chunks of cottage cheese. They are crispy.The Garden Special Pizza has a combination of veggies such as crisp green capsicum, onions and mushrooms along with black olives. The earthy flavour of mushrooms stands out.The Margherrita Pizza is loaded with fresh tomatoes. The tanginess of tomatoes blends well with creamy cheese.

I feel I learn something new every day in the kitchen, be it experimenting with flavour profiles, creating a unique dish and recipe, or trying an ingredient we have never tasted before.As I belong to the community of Chettiar from Chettinad which is famous for its hospitality, so I believe cooking for people and hosting them, comes naturally to me.My earliest memory of cooking was with my mom where we made a lot of fish dishes in Chettinadu style. I would always help her with the preparation especially for our elaborate weekend meals which included cleaning and prepping fish. She has always been my inspiration and I still follow her tips even when experimenting with some unique ingredients in the kitchen.As my mom would always stress on adding vegetables to any dish even to non-veg, to make kids eat vegetables along with their favourite fish or meat, I have always tried to follow the same to make sure my guests consume a good quality of nutrients along with the food.By taking inspiration from this, I prepared a dish that combines my love for sea food and the Mediterranean cuisine and is what I call, a one pot meal. With carbs, protein, veggies, retaining their individual original flavour and yet with the help of simple spices, each morsel becomes a gastronomic delight.The dish was conceptualised to showcase a popular species of fish called Humour, common in the Gulf and combines all that is essential to any Mediterranean country and is the core of their everyday food such as olives, semolina, olive oil, cherry tomatoes that give a fresh look and taste to the dish and come together to enhance the experience of this fish dish.Food more than its flavour, is a tradition, it is a rare blend of culture and emotion, and it is an art crafted to create an emotional connection. Seeing guests walk out of your restaurant with a big smile on their face and having them enjoy the meal is an amazing feeling.I believe, as a chef, I am always obliged in promoting a healthy society and I find it amazing to take up such a huge responsibility even though the hours are long and the pressure is immense, the rewards are massive."

Additionally, China has blocked the import of dry fruits and dates from Afghanistan, hitting the trade here badly.Since the beginning of this year, our export of tomatoes, garlic and soya bean to Pakistan has been hit badly. For last two months, the Pakistani authorities did not unload 43 trucks of garlic sent from here. The crop was lying at the Integrated Check Post (ICP) at Attari. Such is the condition of hundreds of trucks of soya bean that were refused by the health authorities of Pakistan citing that these were not fit for consumption, said president Karyana and Dry Fruit Association (Amritsar) Anil Mehra told the New Indian Express.Now they are not allowing tomatoes from here citing the same reason. Tomato prices in Pakistan have gone as high as Rs 150 per kg. The Pakistani authorities have even issued TV advertisements recommending the use of curd instead of tomatoes while cooking, he added.The issue has also affected the 35-year-old trade relation between Afghanistan, from where India imports dry fruits and dry dates regularly. India gets only cement and gypsum from Pakistan and Afghanistan now, Mehra said.If Pakistan does not want to continue trade relations with India due to pressure from its radicals, India should withdraw the status awarded to Pakistan as its most favoured trading partner.The negative sentiment between both the countries is not good for trade. There is a possibility of a decline in the trade relations between the countries in the coming days. Pakistan has already stopped importing perishable goods from us, said Rajdeep Singh Uppal a leading exporter and former chairman of Confederation of Indian Industry (Amritsar Zone).India mainly imports cement, gypsum, dry fruits, rock salt from Pakistan while it exports meat, vegetables, soya meal, raw cotton, yarn to Pakistan."

The video conspires that massive quantities of coagulated blood, which is a side product of the meat industry, is brought to the factories that make ketchup.In the next step, the video says that the blood is mixed with a narcotic drug cocaine and urine, where its is supplied directly from the sewer line itself.

The prices of onion have remained largely unaffected as traders had large stocks from before the strike.Russell Market Traders Association general secretary Mohammed Idrees Chaudhary said the prices of vegetables and fruits had started witnessing a rise with the onset of summer as the yield is lesser.The ongoing transporters strike has caused a further spike in prices.A resident of Nagarbhavi said the prices of fruits and vegetables had already been on the rise, and have increased further in the past two-three days.

I have always been a foodie and hailing from the South of Tamil Nadu, I had the opportunity to taste and relish a wide array of cuisines  from Madurai to Virudunagar and Tirunelveli, I have savoured it all! But becoming a chef was never a planned decisionone led to another and I got into hotel management. Gradually, I became fascinated with the profession and here I am!I love travelling and in the last two decades, I have travelled to many countries. Specialising in the European and Mediterranean cuisine happened through all my travel-cum-food expeditions (smiles). One such memorable experience was in Mauritiusworking with chefs there taught me the nuances of cooking delicious Mauritian food. The usage of herbs and spices in Mauritian dishes are similar to that of Indian cuisine  turmeric, cardamom, thyme, curry leaves and coriander are most common. Sounds similar to what we use, doesnt it? Yes, they like spicy food too.But for me, developing my skills in cooking has always been experimentation and if I have to reveal something about my home kitchen experiencehere goes: I have never entered the kitchen at home! My wife and mother dont let me enter the kitchen (laughs).I have a keen interest in learning new thingsand my love for trying out organic food is beyond words. In fact, I use organic materials for my preparations and I even have an organic farm in the hotel. We grow our own veggies and herbs. The freshness of ripe organic tomatoes and brinjal can be experienced only when you taste it!I support organic food and I try and help local cultivators with their produceits their livelihood.I do a lot of molecular and progressive cooking, plus, I fuse cuisines  Indian with a touch of European and so on. When it comes to my personal preference, my palette is simple. A bowl of rice with rasam and vegetable is enough for me to savour and relish.But I have a confessionI have a sweet tooth! I love the velvety chocolate pudding and chocolate marquiseanything with chocolate and cheese  I am all for it (chuckles). The Tuscan brick chicken, which is heated over a brick, on a grill and the lamb loin are my specialties. The brick chicken has a rustic taste and aroma and is a brilliant choice.Like I said, I rarely cook for my family and I enjoy eating their food. If theres something I would like to prepare for them, it would be the classic mutton biriyani  made in the traditional way  with seeraga sambha rice, and of course, hand-ground masalas.Its always been my dream to do a back-pack trip across Europe and learn their traditional food. What we see in menus here are just a part of itapart from this, there are several authentic cuisines. Similarly, in India, not many know that there is something beyond Chettinad in South. Theres Nilgiris, Madurai, Virudhunagar, Kongunadu cuisine and many more. If I were to retire and cook a particular cuisine for the rest of my life, I would definitely choose Indian."

He and several of his friends replied - from the supermarket! That completely freaked me out! she exclaims. That made her decide to grow vegetables in her house as a personal choice. I wanted my son to know where his food comes from.This was also partly because she felt that children form a certain socio-economic background and above were disconnected from the earth.  In fact, we tell children not to play in the soil! That was the impetus for me to do this on a certain scale in my house and introduce my friends to it too! And once youve tasted something you ve grown, nothing ever tastes the same,she adds.Today in her own garden both in her courtyard and on the terrace, she experiments with the same using waste produce such as coconut shells and sugarcane waste. It so happens that my professional life and personal life became intertwined!In her courtyard she has a mix of ornamental as well as fruit-bearing plants including banana, papaya, nochi (which is a mosquito repellant).Because I have so many trees, I even have varieties of birds coming - including a sun bird couple - and lots of butterflies! In her first floor balcony are quaint additions like saunf, lemon grass, chicken spinach, basil and such. But her real harvest is on the terrace where she had cultivated her own rooftop farm. She proudly plucks a few pink radishes and displays them.. Salad leaves, pasala keerai, chillies, red ladies fingers, tomatoes of several varieties, carrots....at my sons school(where she has introduced the programme) the tomatoes are as big as a pomegranate! she exclaims. She also does a lot of seed- saving to obtain seeds from plants.If I am told something will not grow in Chennai , I absolutely have to try it. But most importantly I want everyone in my family and others to know how easy it is to do it. For example, I now make my own Bokashi bran (used in composting) on my own, she laughs.

But while many Indians have directed Sri Lankan movies, only three Sri Lankans have directed Indian films so far.The three Sri Lankans are: Batticaloa-born Balu Mahendra, maker of the prize winning Veedu, Sandhya Ragam and Thalaimuraigal; Punguduthivu-born V.C.Guhanathan, who turned out commercially successful films like Thanikkattu Raja and Michael Raj; and Ratnapura-born Vimukthi Jayasundara, who has made the Bengali art film Chatrak.Of the these, Vimukthi Jayasundara is unique for two reasons: he is the first Sinhalese to direct an Indian movie, and also the first Sri Lankan to make a film in Bengali.Chatrak (Mushrooms), made in the tradition of the renowned Bengali film maker Ritwik Ghatak, was shown in the prestigious Directors Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival in 2011, and also at the Toronto, Pacific Merdian and Vladivostok international film festivals.Within a screening time of 90 minutes, Chatrak brings out significant aspects of the realities of urban India as seen in the metropolis of Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), in which corporate interests determine the pattern of growth irrespective of social consequences, and where ambitions to succeed as per the parameters of the day, tear the social fabric and create traumas.The film shows how values promoted by the corporatization of the economy and society lead to conflicts, isolation, remorse, disappointments, irreversible mental imbalance and even suicidal tendencies. The situation created by corporatization leads to the creation of roles and duties which are performed mechanically and often brutally. But even so, remorse creeps to the surface on occasion because, after all, the denizens of the modern world are, at the core, human beings, not automatons.Chatrak is about architect Rahul (played by Sudeep Mukherjee); his long-time love interest Paoli (played by Paoli Dam); Rahuls unnamed deranged brother (played by Sumeet Thakur); and a foreign border-guard (Tomas Lemarquis).Rahul goes to Dubai, like millions of other Indians, to earn a decent pay packet. But his younger brother fails in his attempt because of his disability. Dejected, the young man seeks refuge in the thickness of a tropical jungle. Since this happens to be at the border of another country, the border guard (Tomas Lemarquis) notices him, and after a brutal struggle, pins him down. But it does not take him long to realize that both had been pushed into doing what they were doing - killing people brutally in his case, and going abroad by hook or by crook to earn a living in the case of the young man. The two alienated souls strike an unusual camaraderie.Given the mushrooming construction of luxury condominiums in Kolkata, Rahul comes back from Dubai and takes up a job on one of the sites. The growing inequalities in Kolkata, the pauperization of the already poor original residents of the many construction sites; and his indifference to his brothers fate, gnaw at Rahuls conscience. These also lead to a disconnect with Paoli. But she doesnt want to leave him, despite his saying that she would be better off without him.Rahul and Paoli go looking for the brother, guided by typically Indian do-gooders. Finally they locate him in a thick jungle and bring him home to live with them. But the deranged brother, having forgotten social mores, becomes an embarrassment and the couple take him back to the jungle. But Rahul continues to be deeply troubled. In a moment of frenzy, he dives from the top of the concrete tower he was building.In a conversation with this writer after a special screening of the film in Colombo recently, the 40 year old Director, Vimukthi Jayasundra, revealed how he hit upon the idea of making a film in Bengali, how he got people to back it, and how he chose the subject for the film.Born in the sylvan surroundings of Ratnapura in 1977, Vimkuthi did not want to be a doctor or engineer but a painter. Eventually I settled for film making, which in many ways, is like painting, he said.And he was in love with India.I used to go to India frequently. I drew spiritual sustenance from it as a disciple of Jaggi Vasudev at his Isha Yoga ashram in Coimbatore. I travelled far and wide in India and made many friends in the film world. As a student at the Film and Television Institute in Pune, I saw a lot of films and was particularly fond of Bengali film makers Satyajit Ray and Ritwik Ghatak, Vimukti said.Back in Sri Lanka, the war was on. Vimukthi made a documentary film for the government on wounded soldiers. In the process of making the film he realized how some people are made to sacrifice their lives and limbs for somebodys else cause.As for the idea of making a film in India, it came up at a meeting with his long standing friend, Bappaditya Bandhopadhyay, a producer and director of Bengali films, in Kolkata. Bappaditya said he could rope in Vinod Lahoti, a Kolkata film enthusiast and financier, to fund the venture.The subject and story line were left to me. But Bappaditya was always around to tell me what is not correct. He would also point his finger at cinematic clichs, and tell me to knock them off, Vimukthi said.On choosing the subject and story he recalls: I hadnt clue about what to portray. So, I decided to roam the streets of Kolkata day after day, observing the lives of the people in various parts of the city at various times. What struck me at the time, was the mushrooming of posh high rise buildings in sharp contrast to the squalor around. I saw the sharp differences existing between the rich and the poor and how the poor were duped into parting with their agricultural land for small sums of money on the promise of jobs on the construction sites.From the middle classes he learnt about their aspirations and problems. I also found that at least a section of Kolkata society was aware that people were being taken for a ride, but others were indifferent.There is a scene in the film in which an old man is trying to wake up a younger man sleeping under a bridge by telling him how the British bought the three villages which became the nucleus of the imperial city of Kolkata for a mere Rs.1,300 and that a similar thing is happening now, he pointed out.Vimukthi also saw how, despite grinding poverty, lack of employment, insanitary conditions and the mad rush to modernize Kolkata, people stuck to traditions tenaciously as seen in the annual Durga Puja celebrations. Beg or borrow, the puja had to be conducted is a grand way. The pujas cathartic effect on the participants was brought out vividly in Chatrak.In the story, the main facets of Kolkatas physical and socio-economic landscape were portrayed through the lives of the successful but troubled architect, his independent-minded lady love, and the deranged younger brother. Vimukthi has portrayed India in all its complexity, both gross and nuanced.Asked why the architect does not die even after jumping from a multi-storied building, for he eventually opens his eyes, Vimukthi said:  I wanted to suggest that there could be renewal of hope,As Rahul re-awakens, a tortoise at the construction site which has been in hiding because of the destruction of its habitat, also emerges from its shell, symbolically."

From investing in coco peat to growing bags, every self taught or professional gardener is looking for ways to use the space around them for better. Bharathi Iyer, 34, who works for the Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation also maintains a rooftop garden. She explains how Facebook is invariably helping her learn about gardening through the groups. I have been gardening for the past two years now. I was doing gardening on a vacant plot next to my house. But since they started construction work there, I shifted to the roof.Bharathi grows all varieties of beans, (aubergines) brinjals, tomatoes and greens on her roof top. I also grow certain flowers alongside the vegetables as they help in pollination, she says. She presently grows five varieties of roses  Bengaluru Rose, button roses, yellow rose, pink roses and blood red roses.Along side these flowers, she has varieties of hibiscus, balsams and gladiolas in her garden. Bharathi seeks inspiration after her mother who used to grow different varieties of flowers. She then decided to take to vegetable gardening and hence has been acquiring inputs from various sources who assist her in gardening. Bengaluru has several urban farmers groups.I found my motivation there. I was very new to the concept of grow bags. It was on Facebook that I interacted with different people and learned so many things about gardening.says Bharathi.Bharathi explains that vegetable growing and flower rearing go hand in hand. For pollination to occur, you require other plants. The flowers will attract the pollinators. They will attract butterflies, honeybees and ants. I realised it is a co-existence. Bharthi also elucidates the formula she learnt to grow plants. Leaves, roots and flowers. The garden has to be formed in this formula. You can't simply plant one range of brinjals and tomatoes and expect pollination to occur, she says.When asked about her views on farming in limited spaces in the city, Bharathi says, Lack of space is a constraint. But farming can be done almost anywhere. If you have a 3 x 6 feet space, you can grow veggies which fit in that area. I have seen people farming in PVC pipes. I didn't know that was possible, until I saw it. Adding to it she also states that people are afraid of failing in their attempts at farming. Farming requires more perseverance than any other profession, she says further.Bharathi treats her plants as her children and takes great pride with her harvest. She actively involves her family in the gardening activities too."

I often have clients come to me wondering what this diet is all about and if it is even effective? - Well, to begin with, the objective of eating more raw foods is to nourish the body with nutrients in an easy-to-digest manner, one that the body is naturally built for. It is about eating mostly or all unprocessed and uncooked food so that the body gets all the nutrients without harmful additives or losing nutrients through various cooking methods. As a nutritionist, I would definitely recommend the raw food diet but it has to be had as a part of a balanced nutrition plan that supports regular exercise.In a study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine in 2005, researchers compared 18 people on a strict raw food diet with 18 on a typical American diet. After four years, body mass index - a measure of body fat - and midsection fat were lower among those in the raw food group than those in the other group.There are numerous variations of the raw food diet and the best part is, that you have the power to create one on your own. Generally, about 75 per cent of what is you eat will be raw and never heated above 46 degree Celsius. It is very rare for people to follow a 100-percent raw diet from the start and hence, below is a simple guide on how to take baby steps towards a healthy lifestyle by consuming raw foodEat Almonds DailyLoaded with nutrients and that satisfying crunch, almonds make for an ideal choice of snack when you are on a raw diet plan. A handful of almonds may have satiating properties that promote feelings of fullness, which may keep hunger at bay between meals. So whether at home, work or on the go, a handful (30 grams/23 pieces) of almonds are a convenient snack that can be eaten anywhere, any time of the day and through the year.Be a Pro at JuicingLearn the art of blending and juicing. Fruits and vegetable juices can give a good start to the diet. Fruit juices contain essential minerals and vitamins that can help keep you refreshed through the day. Vegetable juices can help improve your immunity and boost energy. Moreover, they do not take a lot of time to prepare and are affordable.Less is MoreTry not to shock your system by changing the food it receieves all of a sudden. Include nutrient-rich raw food gradually in your diet plan. Try to start small with a few items and include something new daily, weekly or monthly. This will allow your body time to adjust to the new diet with fewer chances of withdrawal and falling off the wagon. This will also help ease the new process for your digestive system and before you know it, your body would have not only accepted the new diet but has also started providing the desired results.Seeds to the RescueConsuming seeds of sunflower,sesame and pumpkin can help you get the right nutrition. The seeds have many essential nutrients like vitamins and fibre and they are delicious to flavour with simple and easily available organic masalas and spices.Veggies the Raw WayInclude vegetables like carrots, celery, peppers, tomatoes, etc in their raw forms. We all know vegetables play a vital role in our diets, as they support the normal functioning of the different body systems. They do so by providing our cells with vitamins, minerals, fiber, essential oils and phytonutrients. However, a joint study carried by scientists from University of California at Los Angeles and Louisiana State University found raw vegetables contain higher amounts of antioxidants.These antioxidants include vitamins C and E, folic acid, lycopene, alpha-carotene and beta-carotene."

We have the starchier and blander versions but in other countries there are the more pungent recipes from vegetables, beans and greens. They are known to contribute to the gut-health and many people live by them. Hot and biting, these foods can serve well as substitutes for the highly-salted pickles. They can be served as sides or appetisers.Kimchi (Korea)This is mostly made of cabbage, which has to be left to ferment for a week. The chopped leaves are mixed with fish sauce, scallions and garlic and kept in a cool air-tight container. You may need to lose the cap once in a while to let the gases that form escape. Kimchi can be used as a sauce for other veg and seafood preparations. You can get it in Korean and Chinese restaurants such as Hae Kum Gang in Ashok Nagar, Arirang in Kamanahalli and Shiro in UB City.Gundruk (Nepal)Greens such as leaves of either mustard or raddish are shredded and left in earthenware containers. The blackish mushy gundruk is served as a side dish, an appetiser and even mixed with soups. To prepare as soup, the leaves are friend along with thinly sliced onions, tomatoes and the usual Indian spices like turmeric. You could try it at Bameys Resto Cafe in Kormangala.Kombucha (Japan)It is a fermented tea drink and made using SCOBY, which is symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast. This is a mildly sweet drink with a bit of fizz. There is a miniscule percentage (single digit) of alcohol and unless you glug down many litres of it, you wont get a high. This drink is credited with curing everything from diabetes and depression to AIDs and cancer, but these claims are unproven. Get it at Adi Naturals in JP Nagar, Era Organics in Sanjaynagar or Green Channel in Ali Asker Road.Sauerkraut (China, Russia)This is a blander form of pickled cabbage made with carroway seeds and salt. Few people put onion too with this mixture, but this depends on how strong you would like the flavour to be. This is recommended for the lactose-intolerant to get their dose of good bacteria for gut health. Served at Soo Ra Sang, behind Leela Palace.Natto (Japan)It is made from soybeans. This is strong smelling and was earlier made by storing the beans in a haystack. The method of preparation has changed and these are now mass-produced, available in tin cans like baked beans. This is said to be high in fiber, Vitamin K and C and minerals. Nato is cooked with soya sauce and served with boiled rice. Available at Harima on Residency Road."

Absence of cold storage and lack of government help has forced them to opt for distress sale. Many of them had taken loans to grow the crops.A piece of cauliflower that was earlier selling for Rs 9 to Rs 10 till last week, has now come down to Rs 4. We are forced to sell those at low prices as there is no cold storage facility, said Babaji Charan Nayak, a cauliflower grower of Artia Kusunpur.Farmers have not even been able to recover the input and labour cost either. We are worried about repayment of loans now, said Nayak. Like him, Biswanath Sahu of Rasulpur block had cultivated cauliflowers in one acre of land after taking a hand loan of Rs 20,000 at 30 per cent interest. Due to the low market price, I am unable to recover the input cost from the cultivation, he said.In the last crop season, cauliflowers were grown in areas of Kharasrota-Brahmani delta region mainly consisting of Rasulpur, Dharmasala, Jajpur and Bari blocks in the district. Over 10,000 farmers of the area are into vegetable cultivation. Sources said farmers have cultivated cauliflowers, cabbage, brinjal, carrot, cucumber and tomatoes over 30,000 hectares of land in the area in last crop season. Farmers bring them to the daily market at Barabati and other nearby weekly haats for selling.Sources said there is no Government-run cold storage in the entire district. There is a private cold storage at Chhatia in Barachana block but small farmers cannot afford to store their vegetable there. Construction of another cold storage at Panikoili is yet to be completed, while another at Jaraka is lying in a dilapidated condition. A horticulture official said work on Jaraka cold storage started few months back while the unit at Panikoli is expected to get completed by March this year."

They claimed that after the US and European countries, this commercial type of Aeroponics farming is the first initiative in the country.Every day, 900 kg of vegetables of 18 varieties which include tomato, brinjal, ladies finger, beans, carrot and potato, are produced using 30,000 sq ft space under the Aeroponics farming system located at Sengodampalayam near here.Aeroponics is a process of growing plants in an air and mist environment, without the use of soil. The set-up would be housed inside a green house structure, with a state-of-the art refrigeration system. A completely closed greenhouse with 40 per cent sunlight penetration, 60 per cent sunlight diffusion, covered ground with mounted, automated pulse irrigation and automated climate management are salient features.Sankar had developed the Aeroponics system in 2013. After a study to standardise the farming method for the climatic condition, he formulated procedural calculation in 12 parameters such as room temperature, relative humidity, carbon-dioxide level, sunlight intensity, shadow effect, water temperature, water nutrient and PH value in water.Around 6,000 litres of water would be enough to cultivate 900 kg of vegetables a day. Water would be sprayed intermittently at the root of the crops the whole day. The crops absorb only 2,000 litres as a top up, and the remaining water would be recycled, he said.The net result is a 10-time higher yield from one unit area, which justifies the capital investment. Though this type of farming already exists in developed countries, we could not adopt them in our agricultural system directly because of the variation in climatic conditions. It has taken almost two years for making the unit functional, he said.He said the trial and error identification and mitigation of the same over the past two years in a big commercial set-up has made the plan stronger. He also thanked the staff of the Agri Business Development Cell of the TNAU for their support in rendering technological and funding assistance in setting up the system at `55 lakh.R Murugesan, Director of Agri Business Development of TNAU, said, We have been giving promotional support to them. Recently, we organised a conference with 35 business heads."

So, I am enjoying my work. I love doing workshops and sharing my knowledge. I also travel quite a bit.A Modern Indian cook, Shazia calls every ingredient unique. Every ingredient is unique in its way. It has something to do with the flavours and textures. As a chef, it is a learning to play with new ingredients and create something new. If there is an ingredient, I find tough to work with, I work more on it and figure out recipes. For example, bitter gourd. Everybody feels it is tough to work with.But as you try, it is actually fun to work to with it.She has made a couple of dishes with bitter gourd, but what is interesting is that bitter gourd can be combined with meat like mutton keema. She says people are usually scared to use it thinking that it will be bitter in taste. But there is a technique. She adds, I learned the technique from my grandmother. You need to soak it in tamarind pulp to remove the whole bitterness and increase the sour agent, that you may find due to tomato or tamarind pulp from the recipe.She created a recipe called stuffed karelas after several trials and errors. She explains, They are small stuffed karela cups. They are stuffed with keema, a morocco style mutton mince. Lot of people loved it. The karela adds whole crunch to the dish. The flavours and spices of morocco cuisine make it taste completely different. It doesnt taste like the usual karelas.The chef Shazia Khan was recently in the city for a cookery workshop at Phoenix Marketcity."

Even as a kid, I was good with home-made recipes and I owe a lot to my mother for that!As a young chef, I also had the opportunity to work in West Asia for a while, and I collaborated with the personal chef of the Prince of Wales during my time in Europe.I also worked with Michelin star chef Vineet Bhatia at the only authentic Indian restaurant in mainland Europe. But I realised that I really wanted to explore modern Indian food and experiment with Indian flavours than cater to western cuisine. Especially, I want Indian food to be recognised globally through the Michelin star reputation, and am attempting that through my own venture, Chefman.Martin LouisI am well-versed in European, Meditteranean, modern Indian cuisine, and homemade recipes. I especially crave for authentic tastes in my food. Precisely for this reason, I always work with my own spices and grind my own powders rather than going for packaged ones  be it piri piri spices, sambar powder or Mexican flavours.I dont use adulterated mixes because working with fresh spices induces the flavours easily. Id rather use fresh tomatoes in cooking than go for processed tomato puree, and make homemade pasta in at least one of my dishes.This is because I strongly believe that authenticity is key to keeping cooking natural.I dont believe fusion food is the right way to put it  in fact a lot of our ingredients with western cooking are very similar. It is just that the cultures and climatic conditions have affected the cooking styles. So yes, while I do attempt to experiment I still keep the authentic taste of the food intact.For example, I have taken an Italian dish called Arancini (stuffed rice balls coated with bread crumbs and fried) and used our very own sambar rice or pongal to make the dish! What Ive done is taken the Italian concept and added Indian flavours to it.As for presentation and plating, making it look presentable is not as important as putting the right ingredients to garnish. You should choose elements that complement the taste of the dish and not just for decorating or to make it look vibrant. Aspiring chefs should also take care to get their basics right as well as learn portion control and hygiene control. After that, you can move on to more detailed things like molecular gastronomy!"

As the government will not be in a position to announce a waiver at least for a few months, it has swung into action to ensure the indebted farmers are not hassled in getting a loan for seeds, fertilisers and pesticides essential for sowing, which will begin in first week of June, immediately after monsoon sets in. The government is thinking of purchasing seeds and fertilisers and distribute them with the help of NGOs and social organisations.The Opposition has been batting for a loan waiver for farmers similar to the one given in Uttar Pradesh. The Congress, NCP and four smaller parties boycotted proceedings of the Assemblys budget session for three weeks to push the demand. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had declared that his government, too, was in favour of the waiver, but at an appropriate time. He said his government was studying the UP model of a waiver. He also said that rather than a waiver, the thrust would be on sustainable development of agriculture.To reduce expenditure on farm labourers, the government is mulling funding them from the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS). We have not been able to fully utilise the central funds allocated under NREGS, but on the other hand, the cost of farm labourers is unbearable for farmers. By funding farm labour, we can extend a great relief to the farmers helping them to reduce cost of production. Similarly, on other fronts, too, we are tapping the possibilities to extend the benefits to the farmers, said an official from the agriculture department.The cooperation department is planning to restructure the loans given to the farmers to enable them to get fresh loans for the kharip season. The government is also considering health, education and housing schemes in the package so that the socio-economic burden is reduced.It will be a package of various schemes by 3 to 4 departments to ensure farmers are heavily subsidised to bring farming to the level of affordability. Right from testing of the soil health, sufficient supply of water, power supply at subsidised rates to effective marketing of the agriculture products, we are planning to do everything that will minimise the gap between the production cost and the rate in the market, Subhash Deshmukh, cooperation minister, told HT.The government is also tapping the idea of bring about 22 crops in the list of produce with minimum support price. It will bear the cost of difference between the market price and the MSP, particularly for crops such as tomato, onion and grapes, whose rates have fallen this year. Our aim is to bring cost of production to zero for about 1.07 lakh farmers who hold less than 5 acres of land. Instead of giving them money, the government will purchase the things required to cultivate and distribute with the help various organisations working in the sector, the officer said.According to rough estimates, the schemes will cost around Rs10,000 crore if implemented. But the estimates are primary, and depends on the feasibility of the all schemes being tapped. The schemes could be implemented if the government wins over the demand of the loan waiver, which is expected to cost Rs30,500 crore. But it succumbed to pressure for the waiver. It will have to cut short the schemes, another official from the cooperation department said.Read: Sangharsh Yatra: Waive loan before farmers lose patience, say Maharashtra opposition leadersMaharashtra Opposition intensifies attacks on govt, kicks off second Sangharsh Yatra for farm loan waiver"

Chief minister Raghubar Das will inaugurate the processing plant, which will process vegetables including green peas, jackfruit, beans, cauliflower, ginger and litchi.Mother Dairy, a subsidiary of National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), markets its vegetable and fruit products under the brand name of Safal, which has been exporting processed food products to 38 countries.The trial run for pea and jackfruit processing, which was started in February this year, has been successful and the plant is ready for commercial production.The plant of second phase, which will extend the processing of tomato, mango, guava, amla and other fruits, is expected to begin functioning from November this year, said officials on Monday.This will be the eastern regions first high-tech integrated automated processing plants along with individual quick freezing and aseptic pulping line facility, said Dilip Rath, chairman of NDDB.Das had laid the foundation stone of Mother Dairys third biggest vegetable and fruit processing plant in February last year.Jharkhand is a vegetable surplus state, producing 38 lakh metric ton vegetables annually against the requirement of 30 lakh metric tonne. The state supplies around one million tonne vegetables to other states, mainly Bihar, Odisha and West Bengal .Due to shortage of buyers, farmers have to dump their surplus produce every year. This year, thousands of farmers dumped tomato and peas at their farm fields, as tomato price dropped to 50 paise kg, while green peas was sold at Rs 2 per kg in wholesale market.Farmers income will grow with operations of the plant, as raw material would be purchased from farmers at fair price.

The programme started in December last year and germination has begun in the area, the state horticulture department said. It added that the crop will be ready by February.Usually, this area gets vegetables around April, but by using this technology we can get vegetables by February. This will also meet the demand (for vegetables), said Deen Mohammad Khan, district horticulture officer, Gurgaon.The horticulture department said it has plans to extend the programme to crops affected by a bad monsoon too. It could stabilise the prices that go up every year around the time due to disrupted supply.Under this method, tunnels are dug within five to six feet of each other and soil preparation is done before sowing, which started in December.We have sowed cucumber, melons, watermelons, bitter gourds, squashes and snake gourds that are easy to grow in these tunnels. The low tunnels get better sunlight, ventilation and get water through drip irrigation. The tunnels are suitable for growing tomatoes, cucumbers and melons, said Khan.In one acre, a farmer can earn Rs2.5 to Rs3 lakh per harvest and the setup can be used for three years without tilling the land, he added.The mulching procedure involves simple techniques to create the tunnels. Bamboo sticks are tied to plastic sheets in a semi-circular structure to support the growing vegetable. Another plastic sheet is then placed on the structure to trap sunlight inside and create an optimal temperature for the crop to grow. The covered layer also reduces water loss and eliminates growth of weeds.At present, 160 farmers are with us in this programme. Our target is to increase this number by five times to serve the entire population of Gurgaon, said Khan."

Farmers of Bhandra, Kero, Kuru and Senha blocks of Lohardaga district and in Ranchi and other parts of the country Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradeshhave been dumping their tomatoes, onions and French beans.Huge dumps of vegetables were seen along Ranchi-Tata highway (NH-33) near Bhuinyadih vegetable market in Ranchis Tamar block after having been forced to sell their produce at throwaway prices because of bumper crop and cash crunch.The National Institution for Transforming India (Niti) Aayog in a recent paper admitted to the slump in vegetable prices, but attributed it to the bumper crop and not demonetisation of Rs 500/1000 notes.We are in catch-22 situation. Traders are not buying our produce. We neither able to sell the vegetable nor to take it at home, Jaipal Singh Munda, a tomato farmer, said.Jagdish Mahato, a trader at Bhuinyadih wholesale market, said, Tomatoes and French beans are being sold at Rs 1-2 a kg in the market while cauliflower is Rs 5 a piece for last few days.However, the price of tomato is Rs 6-10 a kg, French beans and cauliflower Rs 10 in vegetable markets in Ranchi city.With good monsoon this year, farmers have produced bumper crops in the country.Traders purchasing power has declined after demonetisation. They have restricted their orders. West Bengal traders are not coming to buy vegetables from Jharkhand at this time, said Nakul Mahato, a vegetable grower from Ranchis Pithoria area, who also sells vegetables to West Bengal.State horticulture director Rajiv Kumar said Jharkhand recorded bumper crops this year. So, it is natural the demand will fall. We are trying to increase the demand through advertising significance of tomato on health.He said residents would be requested to buy tomato and store them as ketchup.Next year onwards, vegetable route will also be defined where farmers will be requested to produce different vegetables so that farmers do not see such situation, he said.Jharkhand is a known for surplus vegetable production. According to Jharkhand state horticulture mission (JSHM), the state produces around 38 lakh metric tonne vegetables annually against a requirement of 30 lakh metric tonne.

In its first two years, the government cleared more economic reforms  including deregulating diesel prices, cutting cooking gas subsidy and making it easier for companies to exit business  than in the last five years of the previous government. Millions more have been brought into the countrys banking system and the government has pushed digitisation.In the latest budget, the government also announced incentives to labour-intensive sectors such as clothing and leather along with spending more on projects like roads, railways, low-cost housing and irrigation.I will give the Prime Minister two out of 10. Even 2 seems two much. I feel like giving only one. Modis foreign policy is good . The one point is just for that.But Modis critics say much of this is old wine in a new bottle, minor cosmetic tweaks that havent put India on the path of a paradigm shift the prime minister had promised.Economic growth hasnt created enough jobs because of lack of investment, income inequality has grown, farm distress has soared and the cash ban has only worsened the economic outlook in the immediate term. Credit to industry remains flat and, despite higher farm credit target, disbursement levels have dipped as banks seek to avoid bad loans.Even for some Modi fans like Rambir Rathi, a sugarcane farmer in Uttar Pradeshs Baghpat, the dream of achhe din is coming unstruck.I voted for Modi. Farmers like us were promised Rs 500 for a quintal of sugarcane instead of the Rs 315 we were receiving then. I believed in him, says the father of two.They told us our dues would be paid by the sugar mill owners but look what has happened. The rate is the same. Our dues remain unpaid.Asked to rate Modis governance of more than two years, Rathi gives the prime minister two on 10.Do bhi jyada hai. Mann toh nahin karta hai ek bhi dene ko (Even two is too much. I dont feel like giving him even one), he says, adding Modi had only done well on dealing with Pakistan.But farms in distressWith mounting debt, poverty, increasing health cost and other ballooning farming-related expenses, farm incomes dropped 50%-70% over the past years. And just farmers hoped to claw back from two years of back-to-back drought, the government ordered a disruptive currency ban that squeezed the largely cash-only agriculture sector.Farm prices crashed as farmers dumped tomatoes and potatoes onto the streets, fed unharvested crop to cattle and farm hands sat idle. A farm loan write-off for two months after demonetisation hardly helped, some economists say.Februarys budget raised the farm credit target to by 11.1% to Rs 10-lakh crore in 2017-18 but, in reality, bank lending to farmers has dropped and the distribution of credit has focussed on a handful of relatively better-off states.Expenditure on agriculture is seen rising marginally to Rs 2.06-lakh crore in 2017/18, but this in real terms might signal a decline.Fewer jobsSigns of distress are clear in cities as well. Sharp rises in education and healthcare costs in the last two years have hit Indias burgeoning middle class hard, denting Modis popularity among the relatively well-off.Today, India stands before a unique moment in history: It could choose to squander its immense potential with its antiquated socio-political system, corruption and flighty business rules or build on its cultural heritage, democratic values and a young demography to transform the lives of its 1.25 billion citizens.To begin with, two decades on, nothing less than a $10 trillion economy will secure Indias future, says a recent study by Pricewaterhouse Coopers( PwC). It will have to create jobs on a scale that can absorb 10-12 million people who join the workforce every year, including members of the emerging middle class  a billion strong by 2034.Read | Achhe din will come only after 2019, Cong working on it: Rahul GandhiBut only 135,000 jobs were created in 2015 -- the lowest total in seven years and 67% lower than the number created in the last year of the previous government. In one quarter of 2016-17, for which official data is available, only 77,000 jobs were created  and of these 50,000 were government jobs.The gloom is affecting the youth.Chartered accountant Omprakash Sethia in Bhopal.

Either sell at throwaway prices or dump the crop.Fresh produce like vegetables and fruits are sold in cash, he said, adding that the trade remains affected even two-and-a-half-months after the government scrapped higher-value currency notes on November 8.Cheques are not used. And farmers are not entering into the new economic system (going cashless) that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has proposed. The result is a dip in prices, added Panwar, also member of the Planning Commission of Uttar Pradesh.According to Jakhar, who is also Editor of agriculture magazines Farmers Forum and Krishak Samachar, If the cost of harvesting the crop is as much as sowing, then the farmer will not harvest. If a farmer takes his produce to the market, and it is not sold, or the price is very low, he may dump the produce.Demonetisation has also severely impacted the future of cooperative banks, says Jakhar, a farmer from Punjab, adding that farmers are hoping that Prime Minister Modi will compensate the loss in some way in the Union Budget on February 1.Read| Demonetisation: Rs 22,600 crore loss for real estate sectorIn the face of criticism that the move to scrap Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes had hit the Rabi sowing season, the government has maintained that, in fact, Rabi sowing (winter crop) acreage had gone up this year.While Panwar noted that the Rabi sowing acreage figures is data collated by the government, Jakhar does not think that sowing acreage was impacted due to demonetisation, but he pointed out that the comparison is with a drought year. He added that Rabi sowing costs have gone up and the quality gone down.What the government is telling us indirectly through this (higher Rabi sowing figure) is that money is not necessary for sowing, Panwal said.Otherwise how could a BJP MP say that the note ban helped farmers to correct their budget, or suggest they were spending money on alcohol, etc., he said, referring to BJP MP and Kisan Morcha President Virendra Singh who said earlier this month that the biggest benefit of demonetisation was that it helped farmers avoid fizul kharchi (wasteful expenditure).This means the farmer can fare better without money, he added, with a touch of sarcasm.For sowing, farmers purchase seeds, and when they do not have cash, they use seeds saved at home. No good variety of seeds was used this year, or fertiliser. The sale of certified seeds and fertilisers was lower due to the note ban, said Panwar.Farmers use inferior or old seeds and less inputs... thus quality is hit, he says.Demonetisation has not only hit agriculture, but also Indias vast informal sector -- artisans, semi-skilled workers, house construction workers, etc. -- that accounts for around 45 per cent of the GDP and nearly 80 per cent of employment, says Panwar.The vast informal sector was not paying tax, it is true. But they were providing employment, and wages, and these units in the informal sector have closed down due to the cash limit, he says.Now the stand of the government is that no one should operate without paying tax. The main purpose of this exercise (demonetisation) is that. And so, they have shut down their units, and those who were earning wages are now sitting idle.While the cash situation has eased, the job scenario continues to remain bleak, says Panwar, adding that the note ban effect will be felt for quite some time.Read| Baba Ramdev supports Modi for surgical strike and demonetisation"

Here, she creates Arabic-language recipe videos, cooking food ranging from Middle Eastern specialties to all-around favourites like brownies and ice cream.Adi is the founder and CEO of Basmaty World , an Arabic-language cooking channel on YouTube that she is transforming into a network that brings cooks from across the region under one brand. Basmaty generates around 1 million views per month on YouTube and has more than 300,000 followers on Facebook.She is part of a growing group of entrepreneurs who have chosen Dubai as a ground for growing their business. Two of the regions biggest success stories are based in Dubai. Valued at some $1 billion, ride-hailing app Careem and Souq.com, which was acquired by Amazon last month, have given the local entrepreneurship scene a boost.Adi started her business in 2011 in her hometown of Damascus, Syria, working with a small team of videographers and Syrian chefs, known in the Middle East for producing some of the most complex and delicious Mediterranean dishes.As I was searching for recipes in Arabic, I saw that there was a gap, there was not much out there, so the idea emerged this way, she said. I decided why dont I do a website that provides reliable and high-quality recipes in Arabic to serve the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region.Soon after the war erupted in Syria that same year, Adi left Damascus. To keep her business running, she quickly taught herself how to shoot and edit videos featuring herself as a passionate cook.For Adi, cooking means potentially big business with lucrative deals. In 2014, Japans recipe portal Cookpad acquired Lebanese cooking site Shahiya for a reported $13.5 million.Adis videos take hard work behind the scenes, including collaborating with brands for recipe creation and product placement.She spends hours shooting video and photos of her recipe creations, before editing and posting the mouth-watering final results for her more than 180,000 subscribers on YouTube.In this Tuesday, April 4, 2017, photo, Alia Adi, founder of YouTube cooking channel Basmaty World, works at her studio in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. (AP Photo)On this particular shoot, Adi whips up a popular Levantine dip called lebnah, made fresh from yoghurt she strained overnight. She chops pistachios and apricots before drizzling honey on one lebnah dish. On another, she adds chopped olives, sun-dried tomatoes drenched in olive oil, and more olive oil for good measure.Adi says she has saved thousands of dollars in licensing fees and other government-related costs for her business thanks to help from In5, a government-backed incubator that assists entrepreneurs. In5 also offers Dubai-based entrepreneurs access to work space, training and mentorship programs, networking events and investors.I think one of the major challenges for young entrepreneurs here is related to funding... because ideas, there are a lot of ideas. Theres a lot of creativity, she said.Adi initially relocated to London after leaving Syria, but despite it being easier and cheaper to establish her business there, she settled on Dubai to be closer to her customers and clients.Dubai for me was the best location to do that. Its the country that provides most value for me, as a startup, she said. Leaving Syria, I was looking for somewhere stable where I could continue and grow my business so Dubai was definitely the number one option."

58ff1c877be9e041361628f2,"Thanks to note ban, farm sector may not see 'acche din'",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/594489/thanks-note-ban-farm-sector.html,2017-02-02,,Deccan Herald,"Sagar Kulkarni, Feb 3, 2017, DHNS 8:48 ISTDateline: New DelhiDays after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced scrapping of high value currency notes, Agriculture Ministry officials were eagerly awaiting the details about sowing for rabi crops across the country. The government was facing all round criticism for having announced the note ban at a time when the agriculture sector was witnessing an upswing on the back of a better monsoon after two consecutive drought years.The sudden withdrawal of legal tender of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes had left the farmers devoid of any cash to buy seeds or fertilisers. But as the figures trickled in, there was a sense of cheer as the sowing operations appeared unaffected.Up to November 11, rabi sowing was completed on 14.6 million hectare area  5.7% lower than normal crop coverage and the gap declined steadily. During the week ending January 20, 2017 sown area under rabi crops was 628.34 lakh hectares, which was 6.07% more than last year's acreage of 592.36 lakh hectares.Agriculture Minister Radhamohan Singh has been issuing statements on how demonetisation had not affected rabi sowing to counter the campaign by opposition leaders on note-ban leading to agrarian distress.Experts have been sceptical about the government's gung-ho approach vis-a-vis the rabi sowing numbers, particularly the comparison with the previous year's acreage which was low because of severe drought. Though the government speaks glowingly about demonetisation not affecting farm activity, the numbers tell a different story. According to the data released by the Agriculture Ministry, rabi sowing in 2013-14 had touched 670 lakh hectares and leading to a bumper harvest of 263 million tonnes.Economist Pronab Sen was categorical. Rabi sowing looks big on the small base of last year, he said. Sen, India's first chief statistician, also said the government could have pushed for implementation of demonetisation in January this year as the seven-week gap would have helped farmers make purchases of seeds and fertilisers for sowing of the winter crop.According to Sen, delaying note ban by a few weeks would have helped farmers sell their kharif crop, prices of which had already fallen drastically on account of good harvest. The wholesale markets, which usually deal in cash, had a tough time lifting the farm produce and the maximum impact was felt by those dealing in fruits and vegetables.Farmers in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh dumped their potato crop on the roads in Ambala and Lucknow, respectively, as they had no cash to pay for transportation of the farm produce to wholesale markets. In Gujarat's Surat, farmers threw vegetables and milk on the streets as they had no access to cash after the government kept out the district central cooperative banks out of the demonetisation process.Prices of fruits and vegetables dropped in wholesale markets post-demonetisation as did the market arrivals. Prices of banana, apple, tomato, cabbage were lower in the range of 4% to 9% in November when compared with the rates in October, making it clear that farmers were affected to some extent.Government analysts say that the prices of tomatoes crashed in December because of glut in the market due to bumper crop. But they admit that it would be difficult to ascertain how much fall was because of the glut and how much due to disruption due to demonetisation.Cash crunch in rural areas had turned acute as the cooperative banks as well as primary cooperative credit societies too were kept out of cash exchange affecting purchase of quality seeds and fertilisers by farmers.There were reports about slowdown in farm activity such as timely spraying of pesticides or application of fertiliser for want of labour. Many farmers were unable to make cash payments to farm labourers who were forced to return to their home towns. Cotton trade nosedived as mills were unable to make cash payments to farmers who supply bales.Quiet acceptanceThere is quiet acceptance of this fact within the government circles as productivity may take a hit this year. Also, farmers have bought far less amount of fertilisers this rabi season when compared with the previous two drought years. One set of estimates peg the sale of fertilisers to be nearly 7.5% lower than the previous year.This means that despite high acreage achieved during the sowing phase may not reflect in the farm output this rabi season. According to a study by Ramesh Chand, Member, Niti Aayog, a 1% increase/decrease in fertiliser use result in 0.1% increase/decrease in agriculture GDP and about 0.14% increase/decrease in crop output.If the current trend in the shortfall in fertiliser consumption continued till the end of the rabi season, it could lead to a more than 1% decline in production. As a result, the rate of growth in farmers income is also expected to dip due to the drop, though Chand still pegs it at 5.8% in real terms for 2016-17.Indias farm sector was looking set for some good times after two consecutive drought years that had slowed down growth and even witnessed a contraction of 0.2% in 2014-15. The normal monsoon had cheered the farmers who had reaped a better kharif harvest and were keen to follow up with even better returns in the winter crop cycle.Ratings agencies had forecast 4% growth for 2016-17 over the previous year which was certainly brighter given the meagre growth in the past couple of years. The sector had barely witnessed growth since 2011. In 2012-13, the farm sector grew by 1.5%, followed by 4.2% in 2013-14, -0.2% in 2014-15 and 1.2% in 2015-16. At a time when things were looking up, the demonetisation decision has pushed the long desired achhe din for agriculture in the realm of uncertainty."

Their family -- six boys and a girl -- had been eating little for the last three months as money ran out and supplies became harder to get a hold of in the half of the northern Iraqi city that is still under the rule of the Islamic State group.Iraqi forces, after capturing the east in January, have been gearing up for a final assault on the west that officials say could come at any time. In past weeks, people have been slipping out of the western sector, saying a mix of poverty and low food stocks meant that getting food had become a serious problem.People were eating whatever they had, water with bread, or water with tomato paste, said Umm Mohammed. Her kids sometimes went to bed without even that. She and her family made it to eastern Mosul, then to a camp for displaced people outside the city.She spoke on condition she be identified by her traditional honorific because she feared for the safety of relatives still in western Mosul.The United Nations estimates that up to 750,000 civilians may be left in the western half of the city. Aid agencies have no access and all the commercial arteries have been blocked. Since the beginning of the year, around 140 families -- some 600 people -- have made it out of the west to the camps of displaced, according to the UN.The militants have been trying to prevent residents from leaving.Iraqis from Mosul queue for permission to pass through a checkpoint in Bartella. Hundreds of people arrive at the checkpoint every day either fleeing the violence in their home city or to visit their relatives elsewhere in Iraq. (AP)Dafr Mohammed, a 24-year-old farmer from Baddoush, a town on the northern outskirts of the city, said he arranged a boat to cross the Tigris river to the eastern side but was caught by the militants. He was only able to get out because he convinced them his wife was sick and needed a doctor -- and because he left other relatives back in the west, which they took as a guarantee.Most nights we went to bed hungry, including the two kids, said Mohammed.He said the problem wasnt so much the lack of food but that people had no more money to pay for it. Daesh took all the wheat and barley we harvested this year without payment so we didnt have any money, he said, using the Arabic acronym for IS.He survived by doing odd jobs and sometimes getting some money from an uncle who was still receiving his pension. By January, they run out of heating fuel and wood, and started burning their clothes to keep the children warm, he said.Prices in western Mosul have skyrocketed, especially after the road to Syria was blocked late last year, because no more food was coming in, those who escaped said. A 50 kg sack of rice rose to 120,000 dinars ($95), from 19,000 ($15). A sack of flour, once 1,000 dinars ($.80), is now 7,000 ($6).The UNs humanitarian arm said earlier this month that powdered milk for babies had become almost completely unavailable and that a lack of drinking water was also a problem.Abdul-Rahman Aouf Aziz, a 24-year-old who fled in January, said he had got out because he couldnt handle it anymore and was prepared to risk his life in the escape.There was no life left there. It had become very hard, he said."

The initiative is aimed at growing soil-less vegetables and getting them supplied to the residential societies across the city.The focus is on growing vegetables minus the harmful effects of pesticides. The project was launched in January 2016.This is the future of farming and vegetable cultivation. Instead of soil, coconut fibre is used to fill the pots and liquid nutrients are provided in a controlled environment, Din Mohammad Khan, district horticulture officer, said.Vinay Jain, an active participant in this futuristic agricultural project, said, To grow soil-less vegetables, we have to provide the plants with adequate sunlight, ensure proper environs and temperature for them to grow and add the nutrients required.Those engaged in this effort are trying to grow vegetables and fruits such as cucumber, tomato, capsicum, strawberry, lettuce and other leafy varietiesFarming materialThe process involves coconut fibre, filtered water, liquid nutrition, pebbles and saplings . Once soil-less farming picks up and finds takers among residents, people would also be encouraged to use to hydroponic system to enable terrace gardening or farming.Growing period and project costNon-fruit bearing vegetables takes less than 15 days to grow, while the ones that bear fruit take about a month to grow. While it costs 60 lakh to grow soil-less vegetables over a one-acre area, the cost goes down if they are grown in a lesser space.BenefitsThe hydroponic process of growing soil-less vegetables ensures that they are available all around the year. Those involved in the project said the plants grow 50% faster than they would on soil and quantitatively too, the produce is a lot more. Vertical structures are being used for cultivation.At present, tomatoes, basil and parsley are being grown on a one-acre plot.A huge advantage of soil-less farming is that it doesnt allow nematodes (roundworm or threadworm) to affect food crops or vegetables. The nematodes that inhabit the soil not only damage the stems, but also impairs the foliage and flowers. The vegetables damaged by these worms could be harmful for health, Khan said.In this process, all vegetables are grown in a uniform space and the coconut fibre does not retain excessive water. We do not require fertilisers and pesticides as the vegetables are grown in a controlled environment. We use a polythene sheet to shield the vegetables from ultraviolet rays. The plants grow in a safe and healthy environment and produce vegetables and fruits free of chemicals, Dhruv Kumar, a farmer engaged in thisproject, said.This mode of farming could soon be adopted in condominiums and high-rises as it would enable residents to grow vegetables free from the harmful effects of chemicals. At present, we are analysing the quality of the produce and the feasibility of this mode of farming. In a city like Gurgaon, which gets less rainfall, the hydroponic system of growing vegetables could find a lot of takers, Khan said.The demand for safer and healthier food has prompted the use of new technologies and scientific research to grow fruits and vegetables without chemicals."

So, notebandias demonetisation is called colloquiallycouldnt have come at a worse time. With money sucked out of the market, there was a tomato glut, and prices crashed by 80%.A 15-kg crate of tomatoes traded this year between Rs 30 and Rs 50 (instead of Rs 700 at its peak), said Kumar. I had no reason to spend on transportation and bring it to the market or wait for the price to pick up. So, I uprooted all my tomato plants in late November to minimise the loss. This is the worst we have seen in my experience.Kolar is the biggest vegetable-growing region in Karnataka, and houses Asias second-largest tomato market. In November, the ruling price of tomatoes in the Kolar market was Rs 3-5 per kg, or 85% lesser than the same time in 2015.Kumars case is echoed across India. The price of tomatoes crashed to 25 paise/kg, The New Indian Express reported on December 10, 2016, which prompted farmers in a Chhattisgarh district to dump nearly 100 tractor-trolleys, or about 45,000 kg, of tomatoes, on a national highway.Similar incidents by frustrated farmers were reported in Nashik, Hyderabad and other key vegetable-growing regions.Worst hit: Southern tomato farmers, western onion farmersTomato farmers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu were the worst hit since prices fell by 60-85% while onion farmers were the worst hit in Maharashtra and Gujarat, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of vegetable prices in seven Indian citiesAhmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbaibetween November 2015 and November 2016.Source: National Horticulture Board; Negative values indicate rise in pricesThe price of potatoes, which have a shelf life of up to 2-3 months, was stable in places such as Delhi and Chennai, while it rose between 17% and 25% in Bengaluru and Mumbai. The price of potatoes per quintal was Rs 1,086 in November 2015, increasing 27% to Rs 1,376 in November 2016.The price of peas dropped between 15% and 20%, with arrivals increasing in six cities, except Mumbai.The crash in prices was also due to oversupply, the data show. While the prices of tomatoes (hybrid variety) fell by 55-85%, the supply was double and even triple the previous year in parts of India, such as Ahmedabad, Kolkata and Hyderabad, according to data from the National Horticulture Board.In Chennai, for instance, the maximum price a farmer could get per quintal of tomatoes in November 2016 was Rs 760, compared to Rs 4,900 in November 2015, a drop of 85%. The supply to the city was 2,910 metric tonne, an increase of 40% from 2015.In Hyderabad, prices dropped 60% but supply increased 337% in November.Onions were traded anywhere between Rs 650 and Rs 1,500 per quintal in November 2016, compared to Rs 3,027 to Rs 5,600 in 2015.At the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Nashik, Maharashtra, Indias largest wholesale onion market, onions were sold at between Rs 5 and Rs 7 a kilogram.In the seven cities we analysed data for, supply was 196,400 metric tonne in November 2016, against 186,175 metric tonne in November 2015.The situation worsened in December, as prices fell by another 20-50%, and peas traded at a 10-year low in the Delhi market, according to officials from the horticulture department.Enough rains ensured a good harvest but low pricesThe monsoon rains would subside during September to November, and it would result in lesser yield, indicating lesser supply and higher prices, Bellur Krishna, managing director of the state-owned Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society, told IndiaSpend. This year, the rainfall was good in the vegetable-growing regions of Karnataka.This led to good harvest but the prices are also down due to the cash crisis triggered by demonetisation, he said.Kolar, Belagavi, Haveri and Chitradurga, the top vegetable-growing regions in Karnataka, received normal rainfall during the south-west monsoon in 2016.Karnataka declared a drought in 22 districts and some additional talukas in October 2016; the state received Rs 1,782 crore from the central government, IndiaSpend reported on January 10, 2016.The impact of demonetisation could only be to the extent of 20% of the price fall, said Krishna.Demonetisation is expected to hurt agriculture and informal-sector workers, IndiaSpend had reported on November 15, 2016.Around 9.4 million hectares, or 10% of Indias cropped area, is under vegetable cultivation, of which 50% is given to potato, onion and tomato, according to Horticulture Board data.Most of the transactions in fruits and vegetables are in cash, Brajendra Singh, director, National Horticulture Board, told IndiaSpend. So, demonetisation has definitely had some bearing. Arrivals had increased; so, the downturn was obvious.Tomato cultivation is usually routed through market clusters (around cities) and is profitable, Singh said.This time, it was available from local sources, said Singh. The price of tomatoes had gone up to Rs 50 a kg over the last two years. This year, the climate was favourable and resulted in bumper crops.

A Mumbai Start-Up Will Now Keep Them Fresh for over a Month,http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rotten-tomatoes-a-mumbai-start-up-will-now-keep-them-fresh-for-over-a-month/story-hf2ZtZW57cYPXgkNmuZBhL.html,2017-01-11,,Hindustan Times,"Ever had to throw out the last few squishy tomatoes in your veggie crisper because they went bad too soon? Well, a Mumbai start-up may have just hit upon something to save those rotten tomatoes.Science for Society (S4S), a start-up by Matunga-based Institute of Chemical Technology (ICT), has developed a novel packaging technology  ProVegie  that will increase the shelf life of tomatoes by a month.Tomatoes, which are the largest growing commodity globally, including India, usually have a life of five to seven days. The countrys daily consumption of tomatoes is 40,000 tonnes, and post-harvest losses are anywhere between 20% and 40% every year due to poor handling, storage and transportation methods.Developed countries store tomatoes in cold storage that extends their shelf life to 20 days, says Vaibhav Tidke, chief executive officer of S4S. This storage method, however, wont work for Indian farmers since its expensive, and there is no constant electricity supply in villages.A survey of 50 vendors in the city found that unlike onions and potatoes, grocers dont store tomatoes since transportation over large distances damages them, leading to wastage. We want this to change. We want this category of vegetable to move to that of onions and potatoes, so a grocer can also stock them, said Tidke.For the last six months, the S4S team is building a mobile-operated machine that can treat and pack 10,000kg tomatoes per day. It will first treat tomatoes and then package them.ProVegie combines fundamental knowledge of how tomatoes respire and allows this respiration through specially designed packaging to create a self-stable product that will ease storage, transport and logistics, said professor Bhaskar Thorat, who heads the chemical engineering department at ICT, and served as an advisor to S4S.This new packing technology will retain the key nutrients, taste and aroma of tomatoes to serve consumer demands. ProVegie, which will be ready by May this year, is likely to be installed in Nashik, Pune or Aurangabad.According to the model developed by S4S, farmers will sell tomatoes to the start-up and can then take back the processed tomatoes, which can be stored for almost a month and sold in the market. At present, the team is creating a value chain, tying up with grocers, retailers, and companies manufacturing tomato sauces.The S4S team has decided against applying for a patent, instead opting for trade secret intellectual property route. ProVegie is designed to be remotely operated from any place with a mobile phone that will be configured with the SIM card in the machine. This is to ensure that the machine is not opened, said Tidke. So, the operators job will only be to load the tomatoes and see the packaged product."

Her home, however, is not in places such as Jangpura, Hauz Khas Village, Defence Colony, Greater Kailash-II, Malviya Nagar, New Friends Colony or any other similar localities in the city where you would expect a non-diplomat white expat to reside (African expats of Delhi are another story, of course).Instead, designer Elena Tommaseo, a native of Venice in Italy, lives in Lajpat Nagar. Elena is the only white person living in the vicinity, and this warm evening she is to dazzle us with her take on Indo-Italian fusion cuisine.Little did we know that gaining a glimpse into her kitchen would bring us closer to the texture of Delhis multilayered expat life.Elena had originally promised to make bathua risotto  so far we have had this leafy vegetable only at home, stuffed in a parantha or mixed with curd. Our rendezvous begins with a disappointment.Opening the door, she tells us apologetically that she had forgotten that the season of bathua was over. So now, she has decided to make for us her real home-made Italian pasta with real Italian flour.Accordingly, we find Elenas drawing room turned into a makeshift pasta-making factory. She has fixed the gleaming pasta machine on one side of her dining table and alone she is performing the complicated process of rolling out the dough into long narrow pasta strips.On finding herself being photographed, she looks alarmed and says, Oh no! Please dont portray me as some crazy Italian woman who rolls out pasta every night in her home... please mention that I often make simple dal chawal for dinner!It is, after all, Elenas seventh year in the country, long enough for her to develop a taste for Indian khana. At times, she even goes to the extent of ordering dal makhani from Mughal, a nearby restaurant just behind Eros cinema. (Her kitchen rack stands out with one of its takeaway boxes.)Like most Delhiwallas, Elena is hypersensitive about her address  this has been her flat for four years. Its true Im living in Lajpat Nagar but Im more of a Jangpura person... I just dont have the budget for its high rents.Though these two neighbourhoods are next to each other, the green expansive Jangpura feels a continent away from the congested Lajpat Nagar. (Next to Jangpura is the beautiful Nizamuddin East, which is even more vulgar in its rents.)Even so, we find Elenas neighbourhood quite charming. Hers is a park-facing flat. Alas, the park has neither grass nor flowers, and is teeming with a large number of women and children. Its a little too alive, she says. Without any bitter feelings, Elena talks of the long wakeful nights when the neighbourhood hosts devi jagrans and mata ki chowki prayers in the park the whole night long, with the loudspeaker playing devotional bhajans.To be sure, Elena is lucky in having kind neighbours who occasionally invite her for a cup of chai. It is another matter that she is extraordinarily shy of giving them a chance to showcase their hospitality.  Im always asked the same questions during these visits, she says with an amused sigh. Have you married? If I say no, then the next question is  what is your age?Are you married? We ask Elena.She makes a face.Delhis friendly auto-rickshaw drivers also show an active interest in Elenas marital status. By now, she has developed a standard response to quickly kill the curiosity  Yes, Im married. Yes, my husband is a businessman. Yes, I have two children. Yes, one boy, one girl.We follow Elena into her kitchen. She begins the preparations for the pastas tomato sauce by opening a tetra pack of factory-made tomato puree. It tastes better than the Indian tamatar, she says, her voice betraying a hint of contempt as she utters the word tamatar. The Indian tomato tastes too mild, she declares.Picking up a bottle of oil, she says mournfully, I have to use the extra-virgin olive oil from Spain... we Italians are just not good in selling ours abroad.Finally, the meal is ready to be served and Elena arranges the table, complete with forks and knives  not to forget the Indian-made red wine in the wine glass. It is almost feeling like as if we are in Italy. Just then a pressure cooker gives out a shrill whistle from one of the kitchens in the neighbourhood. The aroma of arhar dal wafts through Elenas window. The Italian spell gets broken.But the pasta is truly delicious."

He reportedly offered power to the state at Rs 1.75 per unit. The CM said he will review all power purchase agreements (PPAs) to assess the cost differential.In response to a suggestion by Ambani for introducing the metro rail service in Punjab as public-private partnership, the CM invited his firm to study the urban transport system in Ludhiana to explore the possibility of setting up an elevated metro.Ambani also sought land for setting up testing ranges for his firms new defence projects, while Goenka showed interest in setting up a tractor tyre plant in Punjab. The chief minister (CM) invited the industrialists to explore viability of their projects, assuring them of the governments support in providing land and other facilities. He reportedly offered land to Ambani in Bathinda and Rajpura.Mahindra for digitising urban local bodiesAmarinder also welcomed Anand Mahindras offer for digitisation of the states urban local bodies. Tech Mahindra is also keen to set up Dial 100 emergency response system.Responding to Mahindras request for land and incentive package for Swaraj tractors, finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal said about 100 acres of land was available in Bathinda, the strategic gateway to Rajasthan and Haryana. Badal also sought Mahindras support for the hara tractor scheme, which was part of the Congress poll manifesto.While Mahindra stressed the need for a certification body to ensure quality of potatoes in Punjab (the company is supplying potatoes to McCain), Hindustan Unilever Ltd CEO and MD Sanjiv Mehta expressed his companys interest in procuring tomatoes and citrus fruits on a large scale from the state for its Kisan jams and squashes. The meeting with Mehta centred on collaboration with the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) to enhance production of tomatoes.Free wifi in schools, collegesReliance Industries Ltd (RIL) head Mukesh Ambani has promised free wifi to government educational and health institutions in Punjab.

This is the result of a month-long planning of the event. We wanted to execute it in a way that people of this region have never seen it before. Even while ensuring big-time fun, safety of the participants was our cornerstone. We are happy about the turnout. This being our first event, we must say that weve made a good beginning, said B. Pavan, one of the three partners. The other two are Ch. Sandeep and B. Rushi.With the active support of Y Square, a city-based business incubator, the boys carted in nearly 1,700 kg of tomatoes for the la Tomatino event.To generate slush, they watered the area on the previous night and made a group of workers pound the ground constantly using their feet. Weeding out stones and pebbles from the area to make sure it was fit for the revellers to enjoy their dance or play was a challenge, admitted Pavan.We had designed the event keeping youth in mind. It was heart-warming to see small children frolicking around the place. Couples with their children thoroughly enjoyed it, said Sandeep.Organic gulalThe trio brought in organic colours from Hyderabad. We used 500 kg organic gulal in five different colours. One wash and there was no trace of the colour anywhere, said Rushi.Around 800 people turned up against their target of 1,100. But its O.K. The festival warmth we spread through this event is worth all our efforts, said Pavan.Members of the YI Amaravathi, meanwhile, celebrated the occasion at the Bhavani Island on the banks of River Krishna."

Having burnt their fingers growing the negative crop of tobacco, the price of which is governed more by the global demand-supply situation on which they have no control, they decided to go in for organic fruits and vegetables. Now, it is a satisfying experience to grow healthy food through cow-based agriculture after growing for long the cancer-causing tobacco, they said in a conversation with The Hindu . They use only natural fertilizer 'ganajeevamrutham' produced with cow dung and cow urine and biopesticides made from neem and other leaves.There is no problem in marketing the organic vegetables and fruits, as health-conscious people on their own come to our farms from Ongole and other places to buy the farm fresh produce at our doorstep, says a progressive farmer D. Yellamanda Reddy, who grows, among other vegetables, cabbage, cauliflower, capsicum, brinjal and tomato.We also have the satisfaction of contributing our mite in fighting climate change and global warming, says Mr. Yellamanda Reddy, proudly showing the just-harvested healthy brinjal, free of insect infestation.The organic farmers in the village have installed micro irrigation systems such as sprinklers and drip irrigation to ensure much-needed wetting for the crop at a time when a majority of farmers are struggling to save their crops following severe drought in the district for the third successive year.Organic practices adopted by a select group of progressive farmers in the village include residue mulching, composting and crop rotation to maintain soil health, adds another progressive farmer in the village, Rajagopala Reddy, who focusses on growing greens, particularly fenugreek, which is most sought-after by those having high cholesterol, diabetes and renal diseases.This system of cultivation helps in restoration of the severe biodiversity loss associated with inorganic chemical-based farming which kills useful insects, rats, frogs and snakes upsetting the food-chain in the ecosystem, adds yet another progressive farmer D. Chennappa Reddy, while explaining the three-year time he took to restore the soil health affected because of repeated use of chemical fertilizers."

One of the teams visited Mettur Dam in the evening and took stock of the storage level.After assessing the drought-situation in Dharmapuri, the team comprising B. Ganesh Ram, Ratna Prasad and Paul Pandian inspected the damaged tomato crops at Marakottai village and cow peas at Aranganur village in Salem.At Mettur Dam, the team collected details of storage level, inflow and discharge from the dam on various occasions for farm activities in the Cauvery delta districts.District Collector V. Sampath made a power point presentation to the team members at the Mettur inspection bungalow on the grim situation and the severity of the drought conditions prevailing in the district for the past many months.The Collector also drew the attention of the Central team to the meagre water storage in the other reservoirs such as Aanaimaduvu, Kariakovil and also in all the major and minor water bodies of the district. C. N. Maheswaran, Commissioner of Social Security Schemes, accompanied the team.The second team comprising Vijay Rajmohan, Director (Trade, Extension and Drought Management), Union Ministry of Agriculture and Santhosh, Assistant Advisor, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, which arrived here after completing the visit of Namakkal, inspected the affected maize fields at Rayanpatti.The team members told presspersons at Veerapandi that they would leave for New Delhi after completing the tour of Tamil Nadu on January 25 and will submit its report to the Centre.This team was accompanied by Dheeraj Kumar, Managing Director, TWAD Board, R. Sukumar, District Revenue Officer, P. Soundararajan, Joint Director of Agriculture, and other officials.In Namakkal district, the team visited three villages and assessed the ground reality and interacted with farmers. Mohammad Nasimuddin, Principal Secretary to Government, Welfare of Differently Abled Persons and District Monitoring Officer and Collector M. Asia Mariam also accompanied it.The team visited a farm at Rasampalayam where 168 coconut trees had withered. The team accessed the dried-up cotton plants in Singalandapuram, withered onion crops and tapioca plants at Bodinaickenpatti.In Krishnagiri, the Central team was told that the district had a rainfall shortage of 30 per cent impacting on 50 per cent of crop productivity of millets and pulses.Collector C.Kathiravan accompanied the team that inspected Bargur, Pochampalli and Uthangarai.The administration told the team that about 1,09,065 hectares was brought under rain-fed cultivation. Of these, a total of 27,452 hectares has been severely hit by drought. Over 50 per cent of the affected area was under millets, groundnuts and the productivity was affected.In turn, this had caused 3,000 tonnes fodder shortage for livestock.The district ought to receive an average 830 mm rainfall. However, it received only around 590 mm.The team inspected fields under pulses and groundnut crop in Bargur block. Interacting with individual farmers in Sivampatty village and Nadupatty village in Bargur, the team sought information on the extent of damage to crops and the overall impact of drought on the fields, that were largely under groundnuts and other pulses crops.The team also visited groundnut, pulses and millets fields at Oilapatty village in Pochampalli and Dasampatty village in Uthangarai.In Erode, dried-up crops and parched fields stared at the Central officials. The team first went to Nochipalayam village and found that mulberry, coconut and sugarcane crops had dried up on vast swathes of fields. The farmers could not save the crops in spite of adoption of drip irrigation and other effective water management practices. The impact was indeed severe, Vijayaraj Mohan, senior official representing the Union Agriculture Ministry said, after observing that a cocoon unit had to be closed down due to non-availability of water.District Collector S. Prabakar pointed out the dry sugarcane stalks to the Central team.At Attayampalayam, the officials took stock of the complete damage to papaya, mango and other crops. Farmers here said they had gone ahead with heavy investments for raising the crops in anticipation of rainfall.Implementation of the Pandiyaru-Punnambazha scheme would be the only long-term solution for preventing recurrence of drought in the district, a farmer said, while narrating the inability of agriculturists to find fodder for their livestock due persistent dry conditions. The team finally visited Samigoundanpalayam village to assess the damage to turmeric crop.On Wednesday, the team will visit Surapalayam and Moolakarai in Erode block to estimate damage to tapioca, turmeric and tomato crops, and Thalayampalayam, Karukkupalayam and Bolanaickenpalayam in Perundurai block to analyse drought impact on groundnut, cotton and maize crops.(Reporting by Syed Muthahar Saqaf in Salem, P.V.

The Act makes it mandatory for farmers to sell their produce only to the licensed merchants at the mandis of Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) by paying the commission and other charges.Denotification of fruits and vegetables, according to the Centre, will put an end to a chain of commission agents between the farmers and the consumers, creating a win-win situation for both. Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made a strong pitch for the denotification and promoting contract farming in his 2017-18 Budget presented recently.But the Karnataka government holds a different view. We have no intention to denotify perishables (from the Act). Even now the farmers are free to sell their produce directly to consumers anywhere, including APMC yards. Moreover, the government will not be in a position to intervene and provide justice to the farmers if the traders refuse to pay judicious price, Additional Secretary to Co-operation department (APMC reforms) R Manoj said.As per the Department of Agriculture Marketing, cost to the supply chain due to handling of fruits and vegetables at APMCs is only 6% of the total cost of the produce. Cost of supply chain include 5% commission and 1% hamali and other handling cost. This cost will be significantly higher in unorganised sector due to involvement of middlemen at multiple levels.Interestingly, the ruling Congress has refused to denotify perishables despite directions from the party vice president Rahul Gandhi to all the Congress-ruled state governments in 2014. Instead, the Karnataka government exempted levy of market fee on farmers (1.5% on fruits and 1% on vegetables) and made a provision for retail sales at APMC yards.Chairman of Food Processing Committee of Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industries Bharat Shah said APMCs help farmers get competitive price to their produce due to the involvement of large number of traders. Besides, the farmers get necessary logistical support such as storage place at APMCs. As far as consumers are concerned, prices of fruits and vegetables are normally the lowest at APMCs compared to other places, he added, opposing the move to denotify perishables."

Two days ago, I spotted them on a different plant (Ashoka tree) in Maharashtra. We need to have more studies to find out their prevalence and their counter measures, NBAIR scientist Sunil Joshi, who led the team, told DH.One of the insects Kilifia acuminata was found on an ornamental fern in Bengaluru, but may threaten mango trees in future, as seen in Egypt. India ranks first among the worlds mango-producing countries, accounting for about 50% of mango production.Southern states like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala have a large area under mango cultivation, and the pest can easily spread from Kerala to other states if left unchecked.Reported from 35 countries around the world, it is also a threat to litchi, jamun, guava, pear, lemon and coffee plants.Another insect called Protopulvinaria longivalvata was found on a pepper climber grown in a kitchen garden. The scientists describe it as a serious pest as the vine was killed by the insects.Joshi and his colleagues reported in the journal Current Science that they collected this insect in large numbers from Vittal, Karnataka which is near the major pepper-growing area of Kasargod in Kerala.The insect can easily spread to such areas in Kerala and become a serious pest, they said.The third species Trijuba oculata was also reported from Bengaluru and Mandya. It could be a threat to custard apple trees and grapevines in Karnataka and Maharashtra.The fourth species Pulvinaria urbicola, Joshi said, was a notoriously destructive one that can be a big threat to potato, tomato, brinjal, bell pepper and capsicum. This too was spotted in Bengaluru, the scientists said in a separate paper in the journal Zootaxa."

This is resulting in a mismatch with supply far exceeding the demand, says N. Mohan Reddy, a farmer of Kothagadi in Vikarabad district.Crop given upInstances of farmers digging up fields in preparation of new crop without harvesting the standing crop have been reported from the neighbouring Ranga Reddy, Vikarabad and other districts, known for extensive cultivation of vegetables. A visitor to Vikarabad district will come across fields ploughed with remnants of carrot.The cost of 10 kg of carrot plunged to Rs. 30 to Rs. 50 at a time when the production cost is expected to be much higher. The prices showed an upward trend since past couple of days, but the offer price still continues on the lower side. A farmer incurs expenditure to the tune of Rs. 60,000 an acre with expected yield of over 100 quintals of carrot. But, he would end up with losses when selling at Rs. 50 for 10 kg as it would hardly match the investment and he would still have to bear the plucking and transportation charges as overheads.Another reason for the drop in prices is said to be the delay in harvesting of the crop by farmers in anticipation of good returns. This would ultimately inflict damage to at least a portion of the crop and thereby, farmers end up in accumulated losses. The case was no different when the price of tomato dropped steeply in the open market. The current price of tomato ranges from Rs. 250 to Rs. 300 for 25 kg box, but it was traded at less than Rs. 75 per box during the previous season.Private super market chains, bulk buyers of the produce, decide about the procurement price and farmers complain that they would fix the prices without factoring in the input and other costs incurred by them. The Agriculture Marketing Department has deployed officers for bulk sourcing of vegetables from these growers so that it could market the produce on cost-to-cost basis to the consumers.MismatchThe department fixes the prices for each variety of vegetable based largely on the existing market price. But given the mismatch in the demand and supply, prices tend to be on the lower side most of the times, an official engaged in procurement said.Several farmers complain that the absence of support prices to vegetables has become a bane for farmers as the short duration crops are subject to market conditions and there is no guarantee of fixed return on them. The significant rise in labour costs, thanks to the rural employment guarantee programme, had escalated their input cost further, but there has been no support from the Government in the form of announcement of minimum support price for vegetables.There is also no mechanism to enlighten farmers about the likely demand-supply situation and no advisories are coming forth to enable the ryots to take up varieties that were likely to assure at least return of the amounts invested on the crop.Market interventionExperts are of the view that unlike in European countries where Government would intervene in times of glut to avoid crash in prices, there is no mechanism in the country to educate farmers on selection of crops.Moreover, prices are fixed by the consumers, procuring agencies and not producers. There is an urgent need for enhancing extension activities by deploying officials exclusively to educate farmers about the suitability of the crop as also the likely situation when their produce reaches the market, said M. Uma Devi, Director of Water Technology Centre of the Prof. Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University."

They are using the services of tankers to irrigate the farm land.About five persons in Lakhya and Lakshmipura own tankers to supply water for crops.All the lakes, water bodies and borewells in the village have dried up. Gange Halla (Vedavathi river) stopped flowing in the region three decades ago. The groundwater table has declined drastically.The farmers removing pumpsets from the defunct borewells are a common scene at Lakhya village. They are eagerly waiting for tankers that arrive from cities to fetch water to safeguard cattle and crops.A private borewell owner at Kote Layout charges Rs 100 for filling a water tanker. By the time the tanker reaches farm land, the farmers have to shell out Rs 1,200 to Rs 1,300. The farmers have been struggling to save tomato, black pepper, areca nut and coconut.Tanker water supplier Shashidhar said, On an average, I supply water in six trips in a day. Those who have drip irrigation facility and borewells have dried up purchase water from tankers to save their crops.Farmer Ramesh said, I have cultivated tomato on two acres of land. The borewells have dried up. The tomato plants have started flowering. For the survival of plants till monsoon, I spend Rs 2,500 daily for the purchase of water from tankers. I had not dreamt that such a situation will come up in Chikkamagaluru district. Farming and farmers are on the verge of extinction.I have been struggling to purchase seeds and fertilisers. A situation has arisen where we have to seek financial assistance for purchasing water as well, he said.Farmers Sabeer Khan and Sayyed Sadik said, Looking at tomato plants cultivated on three acre land withering, we decided to purchase water to save the plants.L V Basavaraju had cultivated black pepper as a secondary crop with areca nut on a three acres of land. For the survival of pepper vines, he purchases six tankers of water daily.Farmers from Lakhya, Lakshmipura, Kanive and Kuruvangi are mostly cultivating vegetables and supplying to the market. They are self-sufficient with farming and dairy farming. However, with the drought situation prevailing in the region, saving the crops and cattle have become a challenge for the farmers.Environmentalist D V Girish said, River Gowrihalla, which originates in Shola forest of Mullayyanagiri, passes through Dasarahalli, Kanive to reach Lakhya. Later, the water body flows to Ayyanakere, Sakharayapatna, Kadur, Hosadurga and becomes Vedavathi river. The water from the river will be used by the farmers for irrigating the farm land. With the thinning of forest in the hilly range due to forest fire, the sources of river have dried up. As the river is not flowing, the farm land became arid and dry in the region."

Farmers growing tomatoes are a happy lot as a sudden spurt in prices has brought smiles on their faces but the increased rates are burning a hole in the consumers pocket.A month ago tomatoes were being sold for as low as Rs 5 but today they are available for Rs 30 to Rs 40 depending on their size and quality. Nagaraj of HOPCOMS told DH that tomatoes are supplied to the city from Mysuru taluk but for the past one week only 500 kg of tomatoes were arriving at market places every day. The supply was insufficient to meet the demand. He said a decline in supply was contributing to the recent hike in prices.Farmers who had taken up tomato cultivation on a large scale a few months ago had to face huge losses as the prices crashed due to a bumper yield. With the procurement price going below Rs two per kg, farmers were badly affected. A crate (20 kg) of tomatoes was fetching them around Rs 50 but unable to meet the transportation cost, most of the farmers left the fruits to rot in the plant.With the region affected due to severe drought, only a few farmers equipped with pump sets are growing tomatoes and are seeing a good profit with each kilo of tomato (depending on the quality) fetching them approximately Rs 40.TN dependent on stateWith the neighbouring state Tamil Nadu also facing a shortage, tomatoes grown in Karnataka, especially from Chamarajanagar district, are being supplied in large quantities to Erode, Coimbatore, Madurai, Mettupalayam and also to Kerala.Thanks to the demand, traders are camping in the border district to directly purchase tomatoes from farmers who are being paid Rs 20 per kg at their doorsteps. The direct sales have resulted in tomatoes not reaching markets and also effecting a sudden hike in prices. Only 200 crates of tomatoes are being supplied to the market every day in Chamarajanagar district. Some farmers in Gundlupet and Hanur are growing tomatoes extensively to supply to the Kerala market."

The seer, who has been strongly propagating conservation of native cow breeds, was speaking at the Mahamangala of Mangala Gou Yatre organised at Kulur.Asserting that the study of indigenous cattle breeds assumes profound significance, the seer said there should be dedicated universities to study the benefits of cattle products. The cattle has better health benefits that can also get rid of the problems plaguing the country, he said. Karnataka Bank MD and CEO P Jayaram Bhat said the apathy towards traditional agriculture is the result of ignoring cattle-based agrarian activities. Such confernces reinfuse agriculture and spread the significance cattle to the world, he remarked.Dr Sadana from Karnal in Haryana said Panchagavya (prepared using five products of cow - cowdung, urine, milk, curd and ghee) is not just sacred, but also has medicinal value and is rich in proteins. It also helps in keeping nerves and nano particles in the body, he said. Veterinary expert from Bengaluru Dr K P Ramesh said an estimated 40 Desi breeds have survived in the country. Four among them are considered for high yielding milk, 10 with dual benefits and remaining used for laborious works, he added.He said Indian breeds are capable of facing any changes in weather and it is the only reason why most of the scientists across the globe are conducting research into such interest aspects in the cattle, he added.The change in crop pattern, especially by growing tomato in the fields rich with black soil earlier meant for cotton is also a reason for depleting cow breeds. Krishna valley breed is on the verge of extinction due to this reason, he added. Chairman of Agri System Foundation, Coimbatore, Dr E Vadivel said Panchagavya also helps in increasing crop yields. This fact has also been proven in field experiments, he added."

(Source: ANI)AIADMK (Amma) spokesperson C R Saraswathi today alleged that she and her supporters were attacked by the rival O Panneerselvam camp while campaigning in the R K Nagar constituency, where bypoll is to be held on April 12. The rival faction, however, has denied the charge. Saraswathi said she was scheduled to address a roadside meeting atop a four-wheeler last evening when members of the rival AIADMK (Puratchi Thalaivi Amma), including former chief minister O Panneerselvam and their candidate E Madhusudhanan, were passing through after canvassing for votes. I switched off the microphone and waited for them to cross but suddenly some of their supporters started abusing us and demanded that our vehicle be removed from the place, she told PTI.We had sought police permission for the meeting, therefore, we remained calm when suddenly some of them started hurling footwear, stones and bottles at us, she said. Three of my supporters sustained injury in the incident, she claimed. However, the Panneerselvam camp denied the allegations and said a footwear and tomato were hurled at her from nearby houses and not from the ground level.Aspire K Swaminathan, Panneerselvam camps Media Coordinator said, The campaign team comprising the former chief minister and Madhusudhanan wanted to take a right turn, so a request was made to the rival camp to make way. She (Saraswathi) suddenly started shouting but Panneerselvam asked us to remain calm. Suddely, a slipper was hurled at her from somewhere even as someone else threw a tomato at her, he said. Denying the role of Panneerselvams supporters in the incident, Swaminathan claimed that the attacks did not emanate from the ground level, but from nearby houses.At no point will our leadership get into such activities. This incident is a manifestation of peoples anger at her leadership, he said. Police said they have not received any complaint on the matter and declined to divulge further details. The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) suffered a vertical split on February 7 after then chief minister Panneerselvam revolted against jailed party chief V K Sasikala, alleging he had been forced to make way for her elevation to the states top post.Later, some MLAs and MPs from AIADMK also switched to his side. Both factions have fielded candidates for the R K Nagar bypoll, necessitated by the demise of sitting MLA and former chief minister J Jayalalithaa. The Election Commission has barred the factions from using the name AIADMK and its two leaves symbol. The Sasikala faction has opted for the name AIADMK (Amma) and has fielded Sasikalas nephew and former MP, T T V Dhinakaran. He is contesting on hat symbol.

Bots appear to behave differently in culturally distinct online environments.The findings are a warning to those using artificial intelligence for building autonomous vehicles, cyber security systems or for managing social media.We may have to devote more attention to bots diverse social life and their different cultures, researchers said.The research found that although the online world has become an ecosystem of bots, our knowledge of how they interact with each other is still rather poor.Although bots are automatons that do not have the capacity for emotions, bot to bot interactions are unpredictable and act in distinctive ways.Researchers found that German editions of Wikipedia had fewest conflicts between bots, with each undoing anothers edits 24 times, on average, over ten years.This shows relative efficiency, when compared with bots on the Portuguese Wikipedia edition, which undid another bots edits 185 times, on average, over ten years, researchers said.Bots on English Wikipedia undid another bots work 105 times, on average, over ten years, three times the rate of human reverts, they said. The findings show that even simple autonomous algorithms can produce complex interactions.While bots constitute a tiny proportion (0.1%) of Wikipedia editors, they stand behind a significant proportion of all edits.Although such conflicts represent a small proportion of bots overall editorial activity, the findings are significant in highlighting their unpredictability and complexity.We find that bots behave differently in different cultural environments and their conflicts are also very different to the ones between human editors, said Milena Tsvetkova, from the Oxford Internet Institute.This has implications not only for how we design artificial agents but also for how we study them. We need more research into the sociology of bots, said Ms. Tsvetkova."

It is the problem of plenty troubling the Chhota Udepur tomato farmers.It is the problem of plenty troubling the Chhota Udepur tomato farmers. Many tomato farmers have been forced to discard their crops, as there are no takers. And in the wholesale market, the price of one mound or 25 kg tomato has plummeted to Rs 20 which was Rs 500 last year during the same period.Shantilal Tadvi, 52, had hoped that the harvest of his tomato fields located in the Panej village of Bodeli taluka of Chhota Udepur district would bring cheer to the family this year. However, currently, his harvest of plump, heavy tomatoes is packed in 130 cartons, awaiting a pick up to Ankleshwar and southern Gujarat, where he has been traditionally supplying the fruit. Tadvi is expecting to make at least Rs 100 per maund but is unsure if his best quality crop will fetch the price. The ongoing wholesale rates for tomatoes are as low as Rs 20 per maund.Watch what else is making newsTadvi, like many other farmers in the district, is in distress. Last year, he says, the price for the tomatoes was as much as Rs 500 per maund. I have close to 133 maunds of the first round of harvest. The field will be ready for the second round of harvest soon. At the current wholesale price, I do not know how will I be able to sustain my family of six for the coming months.Many farmers in the district have simply discarded their crops for lack of takers. Through the approximately 15-kilometre stretch of the Bodeli-Naswadi road, lush green fields with red, mature tomatoes hanging in neat clusters wear a deserted look  in many cases the cherry red tomatoes fallen around the fields bear a testimony to the disinterest and helplessness with which farmers have abandoned the crops. This stretch has been a tomato belt for three states  Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.Another farmer Virpal Parmar says many farmers have been forced to throw away their crops to grazing cattle. Farmers are giving away tractors full of tomato vines to the grazers as they know that the crop will fetch no price in the wholesale market. Only those tomato growers, who have been able to produce heavy, large sized fruits will stand a chance of their produce being picked up this year as compared to the small, tart varieties. Most families are in deep distress, says Parmar.The sudden decision to demonetise the currency in November has had a cascading effect on the functioning of the APMC markets and the business of wholesalers, who are unwilling to deal in big numbers, says Parmar.A grazier, Valu Dhana, from Jasdan in Rajkot, has arrived in Chhota Udepur with a large cattle herd. Dhana says he has been fetching several kilograms of tomatoes from nearby villages to feed his cattle for the last one week. As the tomato harvest season came to a close, farmers started telling me to take away their discarded yields of ripe tomatoes as they have no value this year. I have brought in several tractors full for the last 10 days and the cattle are feeding on the tomatoes, says Dhana.Tadvi adds that the farmers are forced to do away with the crop as the cost of picking the fruit is costlier than its market value currently. Each labour has to be paid Rs 60 per day for plucking the ripe tomatoes. If the price is lower than Re 1 per kg in the wholesale market, it makes more sense to discard the crop than to waste money on harvesting it, says Tadvi.However, Chhota Udepur APMC Chairman Atul Patel says that the sharp decline in the prices is due to a bumper crop this year, and not demonetisation. There is a bumper crop this year and that is the only reason why the prices have fallen low. The farmers are discarding the crop right now because we do not have facility for cold storage and it is one of those harvests that is extremely perishable. The prices will soon increase as the season ends, Patel said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Express photo The prisons department has 588 hectares of agricultural land under it across the state. Express photoPRISON agriculture in Maharashtra has gone beyond just a rehabilitation and reformation programme for prisoners. The prison agricultural production across 29 prisons in the state has grown leaps and bounds and stands at almost Rs 4 crore in 2016 as compared to Rs 2.54 crore two years ago. The profits from production has also increased by 15-20 per cent. Across the 588 hectares of agricultural land held by the prisons department, the last year saw new technologies, more suitable crops and implementation of schemes in coordination with government departments, the agriculture university and NGOs. Every year, over 800 prisoners are engaged in agricultural activities and avail remissions based on the number of days they work on a farm.Sanjay Phadtare, Technical Officer, Agriculture, Prisons (Maharashtra), said, Farming is the most sought-after activity among prisoners. It gives them remissions. Besides, they are not working within four walls. Remissions and exemptions are given to those that are serving life imprisonment and depending on the number of days he works in the field and his conduct, he will avail remissions. The more he works, the less days he spends in the jail.The prisoners receive wages anywhere between Rs 40 and Rs 55 per day. Last year, a total of Rs 83.29 lakh in wages were paid to prisoners engaged in farming, steep rise compared to previous years.B K Upadhyay, Additional DG and IG, Prisons (Maharashtra), said, We have about 800 hectares of land available, of which over 500 are agricultural land, 57 per cent of which is under irrigation and rest are rain-fed. While the farming programme was started as a rehabilitation activity, it has gained a lot of momentum with a variety of produces, plantation and allied activities being undertaken by us.From the traditional cereal cultivation like rice and wheat, most prisons have now started producing fenugreek, spinach, Rajgira, tomato, potato, onion, ginger and pumpkin.In Punes Yerawada jail, a large area is dedicated to banana tissue culture and mushroom production, besides citrus plantation in Morshi prison and even mulberry plantation in Visapur jail. Sandalwood plantation is also being undertaken in a few prisons including Yerawada and Nashik.Bamboo, mango, teak, jamun and been are also being planted in the available forest area. Also undertaken on a large scale are goat farming, poultry, horticulture, dairy and fisheries.From 2014-2016, we received a funding of about Rs 1.44 crore from the government and we have been using it to enhance technology and increase wages, said Phadtare.The department, apart from improving the quality of seeds and fertilisers, has invested in drip irrigation, over 20 tractors, farm equipment, electric motors and pumps, new crops and seed production, new irrigation methods and even organic farming such as vermi-compost and also biogas plants. A soil analysis was also undertaken with the help of fertilisers that resulted in enhanced production.Earlier, the rates of the produce from our farms were low. Now, we go by the APMC rates. Therefore, the produce gets proper rates. While some of the produce is consumed in jails, the rest is sold in the market. While we have supervisors within the prison, we get help and training from agricultural departments, nearby institutes and even local farmers to improve the skills of prisoners, added Phadtare.According to the department, more funds have been sought from the government. Currently, of the 55 jails, 29 have land for farming, most of which are open prisons. We are also planning to manufacture agricultural equipment also within the prison premises to make us more self-sufficient, added Upadhyay.radhika.ramaswamy@expressindia.comFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

But, in reality, I am not because of the hurdles being put on my way.Though the entire House including leader of opposition Narasingha Mishra of Congress, was surprised over Routs statement, he went on speaking that it was very difficult to run a democratic government under bureaucratic influence.The minister said he did not get adequate support from the bureaucracy to take up welfare programmes, be it revival of defunct sugar mills or cold storages which could help farmers to a great extent.Had we sufficient cold storages, our farmers will not go for distress sale of vegetables besides potatoes and tomatoes, Rout said adding that he now tries to set up cold storages with help of RMC (regulated market committee).The minister also said that though he has a lot of ideas to help the farmers and make Cooperation department viable, he could not do it because of the lack of attitude and cooperation from the bureaucracy.Rout also admitted in the House that the farmers are under duress for closure of sugar mills and cold storages.Earlier, Leader of Opposition Naraisngha Mishra of Congress had alleged that the state government failed to help the sugarcane farmers across the state. He said the farmers do not get their dues from the sugar mills run by the cooperative societies.Rout said there are five sugar mills in the state of which only two were in operation. Remaining three sugar mills have been closed due to several factors and his efforts to revive such units has faced hurdles from the bureaucracy.The minister, however, assured the House that he would again try to make such defunct sugar mills operational.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

In his subsequent speeches to the people of the country through election rallies and his radio programme, Mann Ki Baat the Prime Minister asked the country to co-operate with him for fifty days after which the results of demonetisation and its impact on black money would be felt. At the end of fifty days the situation in the country is still not anywhere near normal and we still have no answers to the question asked-* Has Demonetisation achieved its purpose, is there a figure to the amount of black money recovered, have terrorism activities shown a fall, have all the counterfeit notes been recovered?* Has the amount of currency in circulation (approximately 86%) that was wiped out in the exercise been replenished and can life be normal again with withdrawal limits on ATM and bank counters removed?* Will the government compensate the farmers who faced losses, daily wage labourers who lost their jobs, families of the 115 dead, the small businesses that faced the brunt of demonetisation?In hope to get answers to these questions the country tuned into PM Modis address on the last day of 2016 sadly what he spoke was on the last day of last year was also a rehash of all his speeches in the past fifty days speaking of the benefits of demonetisation but unable to quantify it even after fifty days of demonetisation. He did announce schemes that were already in place ( Maternity benefits of Rs 6000 being one of them). What is also unfortunate to hear is how the prime minister continues to mislead the people through his election speeches by claiming that demonetisation has ended black money, terrorism and counterfeit notes. Asking him to back it with facts would be near impossible for him to do.The impact and strain on the economy started to show within the fifty days of the announcement, it has managed to paralyze the agricultural economy. Rabi crops have taken a severe hit. Cash crops like tomato and onions have been selling at Re.1/kg and 50 paisa/kg respectively. Modi government put a unilateral embargo on 370 District Central Cooperative Banks and over 93,000 Agricultural Credit Societies, thereby denying agriculture credit to the farmers. Small and Medium industries are shutting down with massive job losses reported in Indias manufacturing hubs such as Tirupur, Faridabad, Ludhiana, Surat and other small and big industrial hubs are also revising their growth estimates. The unorganised sector has been deeply hit too. The unfortunate reality is that the honest cash economy of India, which is the biggest job generator, has been attacked by this unilateral decision of the Modi Government.As the country awaits to hear from the Reserve Bank of India or the government for actual figures of the post-Demonetisation India order the estimates by leading economists including Dr. Manmohan Singh suggest the GDP will decline by 2% or more , RBI has kept it at 0.5%. As per Centre for Monitoring of Indian Economy, loss in first 50 days was an estimated Rs.1,28,000 crore. The Sensex and the Nifty managed to wipe off all the gains made in the year, RBI data released shows bank credit growth at a multi decade low of 5.1%.Composite PMI Output Index fell to47.6 in December, investor sentiment saw an all time low in the past 11 years. There is a near hire freeze in most sectors which could further add to the woes due to demonetisation.The government had initially estimated about 5 lakh crore rupees as black money would be rendered worthless after the demonetisation announcement however those estimates seem to have gone awry with almost 97% of it being deposited in the bank by the end of 31st December. These figures havent yet been declared by the RBI officially. The RBI is also refusing to accept anymore deposits of old currency except from NRIs, which clearly goes against the announcement made earlier on old notes could be deposited at RBI branches after the 31st December deadline was over.The trust deficit in anything the RBI says or the government announces is low with changes being made everyday and no clarity coming from any side. Even after close to two months it seems like it isgoing to be a really long wait for the country to realise, if any, the benefits of demonetisation. However what is most unfortunate is the post truth make believe reality we have been subjected to and the conviction that the countrymen will believe whatever is dished out as a fact by the government."

About nine thousand miles away in USA, my 22-year-old son has come up trumps after poring over my salad book and zeroing in on the salad for his next meal.The two boys are a generation and many continents apart and yet, this innocuous salad book is their constant tasteful companion, albeit for different reasons. The toddlers mother has bought him a whole slew of baby books featuring fruits and veggies but the little guy invariably picks up my salad book from his moms kitchen and sits down for his daily erudition. My older son, The Health Nut, while living the dolce vida in The Big Apple, is very conscious of his calorie intake like a lot of his generation and hence the salad book is whipped out every now and then.Gone are the days when salads were looked upon as slightly better than a bitter pill to swallow. No one ever tossed a salad for a midday meal or sat in front of the TV with a big bowl of healthy luscious leaves and veggies. And no one thought of salads as comfort foods!The current generation is different. Weaned on a diet of political correctness and nutritional knowledge, they are not comfortable with the ghee-cures-all attitude of the older generations. Salads have made their way into their lexicon along with words like YOLO and hashtag.With the temperature dipping in many parts of the country, when someone mentions comfort food, a lot of young gourmands think beyond steaming hot bowls of soup or mac-&-cheese. While a salad a few years back was not considered comfort food material, times are changing. A big dinner-size salad packed with winter fruits and veggies and delicious toppings can help fuel you through chilly, foggy days. Better still, it can do so without making you feel sluggish and weighed down.With the festive season almost over and done with, February is a time to enjoy the bounty of winter foods and markets filled with colorful winter produce. I love browsing the aisles of the supermarket looking at all the vibrant racks of fresh produce. The brilliance of the malta orange, the plumpness of scarlet strawberries, dewy fresh local berries, and verdant dark greens jostle in a cacophony of color on the grocery shelves. Light summer herbs are replaced by collards, mustard greens, spinach, brussel sprouts and my personal favorite, kale.The chill in winter means that there is a craving for food that is filling. For salad eaters like me, this means changing the typical salad to include hearty grains, bright citrus fruits, nuts, root vegetables and hardy winter greens.So here I am on a Saturday morning at our local supermarket trying to pick out the freshest veggies and fruits for a salad for dinner. On the menu tonight are quiches: a sundried tomato black olive quiche and a bacon quiche. I think a fruity salad would go well with the quiches. The malta oranges call out to me with their flaming bright colors. I pick up some green olives and red onions, a block of spicy pepper gouda cheese and I am all set for my familys favorite Triple-O salad (recipe below).To me, the Triple-O salad is an ideal winter salad. It is light and yet has the depth of flavor with its seasonal notes to stand up to hearty winter dishes. Its simple to make with its three to four ingredients, and can be varied based on your preferences or what you have at home.Just before I wind up my shopping, I pick up a bunch of luscious strawberries and a packet of baby spinach. This along with some pasta and stone-ground bread will make for a lovely lunch tomorrow.Back home, as I am walking in, my son calls in from NYC. Hey mom, I have chicken leftovers. Can you suggest a quick salad? I look at the oranges peeking out of my grocery bag, think about the plummeting temperatures in US and decide its time to have a Triple-O date in two cities. Take down this salad, I say to him crisply, as I start unpacking my groceries.TRIPLE-O SALAD:Ingredients:Green or black Olives: 12  15 (pitted)Red onion: 1 small , sliced into thin ringsOranges: 2 large, cut into  inch slices or sectionsCheese : any pepper or spicy cheese (optional)Dressing:1 tbsp olive oilJuice of 1-2 lemonsSalt and pepper (to taste)Method: Start by peeling the oranges, removing the seeds and cutting into neat slices and set aside. Cut the onion into thin onion rings. A trick I learnt a few years ago was to dunk the onions into boiling water for about 10-15 seconds, removing them and rinsing under cold water. This removes the pungency of the onion. Whisk together the oil, lemon juice and salt and pepper. Place the oranges in a plate, add the olives and red onions, and dribble the dressing on the top. You can add the cheese to the salad from the top or arrange it like I do, around the salad edges."

He also serves a sweet version of the snack that feels almost like a dessert.Puri Sabji & Jalebi at Lanka, near BHU: One of the go-to places for early breakfast is the late Chhanni Devis, now run by her son Kailash Yadav.

The three are kneaded into a ball, deep fried and dipped in a fiery curry. Then its served with a sprinkling of sohal, a salty savoury. The pakoras have two variations: sada and rangeen. The rangeen version is stuffed with bhang, a popular intoxicant.Umashankar Sahus Kachoris: Sahu gets the kachoris fried at home, about 100 meters away in a nearby lane. As a peddler, he has the smallest of stands in Chetganj where he keeps the kachoris, a little larger than a Rs 10 coin, garnished with shredded radish and carrot, and served with tamarind chutney.Kashi & Deena Chat Bhandars, Godowlia Chowk: These are two iconic joints thronged by locals and tourists alike At Deena, taste the tamatar chaat, a rather unique snack which uses tomatoes ingeniously and which is eaten out of kulhars (clay cups. During the winters, chura matar, dripping with desi ghee, is the rage."

The most complex and visually striking example from the most sought-after series of the war period, Plant de tomates has been in a private collection for four decades since it was sold at Sothebys New York in 1976. This exquisite museum-quality work is expected to fetch 10,000,000  15,000,000 as part of Sothebys Impressionist & Modern Art Evening sale in London on 1 March 2017.Samuel Valette, Sothebys Senior International Specialist in Impressionist & Modern Art, commented: This exceptional work by Pablo Picasso was painted at a moment of particular tension during the war: the liberation of Paris. As such, it is infused with a sense of renewed energy and hope that distinguishes it from other wartime still-lifes, which were imbued with a more sombre and dark mood. It shows that there was light at the end of the tunnel. For Picasso, the very act of continuing to paint as normal was an act of resistance, and following the Liberation, his atelier became a must-see for the allied soldiers who wanted to witness what the master had created in the war years.In the summer of 1944, Picasso was staying with Marie-Thrse at the Boulevard Henri IV in the weeks before the Liberation of Paris from the Nazis by the Allied Forces. Picasso began to take notice of the potted tomato plant that was growing besides the window of the apartment. These were not uncommon in civilian households throughout Europe at a time when food rations limited the amount of available produce for consumption. Seeing the resilient plant as a sign of hope as it continued to bear fruit, Picasso painted five canvases of the plant on a window sill between August 3 and August 12, 1944  varying in degrees of abstraction. Thus he recorded this consequence of war as a source of admiration and a metaphor of human perseverance in times of strife.In this work, the branches of the plant are weighed down with the heavy tomatoes  their arched shapes standing in contrast with the strong horizontals and verticals of the window, which fragment the composition into a grid-like form. For his palette, Picasso chose vibrant shades of red and green to emphasise the lush and fertile nature of the plant. The background view outside the window is painted with varying shades of yellow and grey, calling to mind the smoke and gunfire that could be heard throughout the city during these frightening last weeks of the war. Rarely has Picasso invested a still-life with such meaning and sociological importance.Although not an active member of the Resistance movement, Picassos artistic activity during the war was deemed as heroic by many of his contemporaries around the world. His art was blacklisted by the Nazi regime and he was not permitted to exhibit his pictures publicly by government decree. However, by this point in his career, Picasso was financially secure and the paintings that he completed during this period remained in his studio  only to be exhibited after the war. A series of photographs that renowned photographer Cecil Beaton took of Picassos studio at rue des Grands-Augustins, several of them showing this work, gives remarkable insight into Picassos work during this period. In the days leading to the Liberation  and in the midst of his painting of the tomato plant series  Picasso met with several British and American journalists and soldiers who wished to praise him for his accomplishment at his studio."

Now, if Bill Gates and other hi-tech crystal ball gazers are to be believed, the taxes part of that observation might apply to robots as well as to humans.Gates has been quoted as saying, Right now, the human worker who does, say, $50,000 worth of work in a factory, that income is taxed and you get income tax, social security tax, all those things. If a robot comes in to do the same thing, youd think that wed tax the robot at a similar level!The golden Gates might well have a valid point. Indeed, knowing that the taxman is famous  or infamous, depending on your point of view  for casting his net far and wide, robots might one day end up paying more tax than their human counterparts.Human taxpayers can  and do  claim a whole slew of tax rebates and exemptions, by way of maternity benefits, for example, which would not extend to the average robot.Initially, robots were programmed to do only assembly line work, at automobile and other mass production factories. But day by day their labour skills are growing exponentially.For instance, there are robots who can look after your needs at home, and do so with a punctiliousness unmatched by even the most accomplished of human domestic help.If PG Wodehouse had been around today would Jeeves, Bertie Woosters gentlemans personal gentleman be morphed into Jarvis, the gentlemans personal android? And would Beech, the august butler at Blandings Castle, find himself out-butlered from his job by a frockcoated Bestech, a mechanical major domo nonpareil?Robots are hitting below the belt, both metaphorically and literally. In a development that would have made Freud flip his id, for a growing number of people robots are becoming their sex objects of choice.As hard porn goes onto hard drive, a futuristic adult movie might well star an automated Sony Leone as its hot attraction. And an updated version of the Kama Sutra could be retitled the Cyborg Sutra. Whereupon a censorious robot group which could call itself the Mechanical Mahila Manch might well take out a morcha in protest and publicly set on fire the offending tomes along with an effigy of its automaton author.Such eventualities which today tax the imagination could tomorrow imaginatively be turned into machine-generated tax revenue.However, a problem could crop up. Any robot smart enough to be liable for tax would be smart enough to evade tax. On the principle that it takes a robot to catch a robot, the tax authorities could hire silicon sleuths to nab such evaders.However, such robotic revenue collectors might be as susceptible to bribery as humans, inspiring a reprise of Arthur Koestlers philosophical opus, The Ghoos in the Machine."

All the upper crust Indians present laughed patronisingly at my display of ignorance and said, really, you didnt know.Nope. No way. Like only the English would make a mince sweet and black pudding a meat dish. We grew up calling custard a pudding or a wobbly jelly with circles of banana embedded in it.I still dont know what is a scallop and it is amazing how some people measure your social worth by your knowledge of these pretentious culinary exercises.Like folks who order Mulligatawny soup like they were making a royal pronouncement from a scroll and you sit there not having the courage to ask what the heck it is, will have tomato soup instead, know that at least.

But, the vegetarian varieties that using mushroom or pumpkin or okras are also fairly common,"" says executive chef at Cidade de Goa, Sunit Sharma.The light yellowish-green gravy is prepared by grinding together a mix of spices like cumin, coriander, garlic and turmeric with grated coconut. The resultant paste is then strained to obtain what is called the first press coconut milk. The extraction of the second press follows post the addition of a little bit of water, and it is in the second press extract that the dish is prepared.Cooking the caldinho begins with a dash of chopped onions and some tomatoes that are used to give the curry some texture. But, one must keep in mind the acidity factor of the tomatoes during preparation. ""The tomatoes' acidic nature is highly likely to cause the coconut milk to curdle if you are not careful. It's important to use just the optimum amount of tomatoes to prevent the gravy from losing its flavour,"" says Oswin Pinto , owner and chef at Hogworth, Miramar. ""If you aren't sure, the best idea is to avoid the tomatoes entirely,"" he advises.ith its origins hidden in the ubiquitous broth or soup , the caldinho is yet another outcome of the amalgamation of Portuguese and Konkani influences that gives Goan cuisine its unique character Named after the caldo, which means soup in Portuguese, the caldinho is probably one of the most understated yet versatile dishes of the coastal state's culinary offerings.This creamy curry was once served at the dining table of the elite. ""Caldinho was eaten with bread by the rich as the first course of the meal during the Portuguese era. Besides the high-value fish, an entire coconut goes into making one plate of caldinho, which makes its preparation an expensive affair,"" says owner of Viva Panjim, Linda D'Souza.Unlike conventional curries that are heavy on spices and chillies, the caldinho is prepared using a generous amount of coconut milk. In another recipe, grated coconut is cooked till it turns into a paste.The principal ingredientbe it fish, or prawns, or vegetablesare added once the onion turns translucent, and the second press coconut milk extract follows soon after. The stew is then allowed to simmer till the ingredients are properly cooked and topped off with the first press coconut milk.The curry sauce is not spicy in the vegetarian caldinho either, but continues to be flavourful like its seafood counterpart. The caldinho goes well with traditional Goan rice or bread and is best served piping hot.""It is easy to cook and lends itself well to a variety of ingredients,"" says Sharma. ""While it might seem unlikely that a coastal state like Goa would have a vegetarian version of the caldinho, the long periods of abstinence from non-vegetarian food, practised by both Christian and Hindu communities has seen the dish evolve over time,"" he adds."

As many as 83 farmers in the district have registered for the cultivation of organic vegetables, which will be tested regularly along with the soil in their land. They have signed an undertaking to organically cultivate vegetables across one hectare each.Two years ago, Kerala's health department issued a notice to Tamil Nadu about the presence of high pesticide levels in its fruits and vegetables. They had even threatened to ban vegetables from Tamil Nadu. Since then, the state government has got into an overdrive to encourage production of organic vegetables and crops.The farmers spread across Pollachi, Annamalai North, Karamadai and Thondamuthur blocks, will cultivate any fruit or vegetable organically across one hectare of their land, said deputy director, horticulture, K Ramakrishnan . ""There are around 20 farmers in each of the four blocks. The blocks have been allotted a fund of Rs 7 lakh each for preparing organic pesticide and insecticides like Panchakavyam, collecting cow urine and neem oil,"" said the director. ""The farmers have to buy their own seeds and have agreed to have their produce, farms and soils tested regularly for the certification process,"" he said.To be on the safer side, a majority of the farmers chosen for the scheme are those who have already been trying to practice or practicing organic farming for at least two years.""For example, in Thondamuthur, a majority of the farmers who have enrolled are those with perennial crops like cocoa, areca nut, pepper, mangoes and even sapottaa. They are also ones with assured water supply from bores,"" said assistant director, horticulture, Thondamuthur, Vasanthi Gnanasekaran. ""None of them have registered for staple vegetables like tomato, onion, lady's finger, brinjal etc,"" she said.This is part of the central government scheme, Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana , to promote organic farming and certification of organic vegetables. ""Under this scheme, they not only get some funds to help prepare organic fertilizers and pesticides, but they also get exempted from having to pay the yearly fee of Rs 2,500 to get the organic inspection and certification,"" said Gnansekaran. The certification will be done by the regional council for Participatory Guarantee System for India (PGS), Mysore.The farmers are free to either form a co-operative and sell their produce to a wholesaler or director or even choose to export them."

However, due to perishable nature of fruits and vegetables and more dependency on climatic factor, many times these crops face either glut or shortage thereby affecting farmers as well as consumers.""The glut situations are observed in many crops like tomato, onion , potato as well as garlic which lead to heavy fluctuations in area and production in subsequent years. The seminar will focus on various issues related to the topic and formulate policies and strategies to avoid the problems faced by the farmers,"" said an official from NHRDF.The prices of vegetables are decided on the demand and supply ratio. Onion prices go up if demand is more as compared to supply and the prices crash if supply is huge as compared to the demand.The average wholesale onion prices have declined to the range of Rs 400 to Rs 500 in the past six months due to arrivals of onions in large quantity at the Agriculture Produce Market Committee markets. It costs Rs 1,000 for producing one quintal onion. Accordingly, farmers incur losses if the prices go below that. Hence, this workshop will help farmers understand the glut management for vegetables particularly onions.Divisional revenue commissioner Eknath Dawale will inaugurate the event."

The crowd surged as the vegetables were distributed outside Raipurs indoor stadium Monday. The road had to be cordoned off by police.As the crowd picked up tomatoes, then capsicum, and then green bananas, peals of laughter were heard. We cant believe we are getting 5 kg vegetables for free, said Sandhya Mandal, standing in the queue. The farmers laughed too, but there was irony in their laughter. The situation is so bad that we are giving our produce for free. We are in crisis, one farmer said.Watch what else is making news:Dharmesh Kumar Tank, a farmer from Rajnandgaon district and member of Chhattisgarh Yuva Pragatishil Kisan Sangh, said, This year, the price a farmer is getting for his produce is abysmally low. For vegetables it is between Rs 25 and 40 a crate, which contains 27-28 kg of produce. The price does not even cover the farmers transport costs.Several farmers told The Indian Express that there were several reasons for the dip in prices, but the irony was that they were being punished for a good season. After two years of bad rainfall, this year was excellent, and outputs were high. That is one of the reasons prices dropped. Middlemen in mandis drive up prices for consumers and eat into the margins of farmers, one farmer said. A lot of our produce, especially tomatoes, used to go to neighbouring countries like Pakistan, Nepal and Bhutan. Because of issues now, that has stopped, added Rohan Chawda, a farmer from Raipur and also from the Kisan Sangh.Several jokes were heard during the protest, many about demonetisation.

Since becoming president in June, Duterte has had an uneasy relationship with the United State, saying he wants to boost ties with China and Russia whose leaders he has met recently as he revamps Philippine foreign policy.The Philippines has depended heavily on the U.S., its treaty ally, for weapons, ships and aircraft for years, although it has turned to other countries for defense equipment as it struggled to modernize its underfunded military in recent years. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, after visiting Moscow last month, said the military was considering purchasing sniper rifles from Russia.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"
5909e9a97be9e033f19b8b92,CSO data on GDP lacks authenticity,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/590673/cso-data-gdp-lacks-authenticity.html,2017-01-09,,Deccan Herald,"Jan 10 , 2017, 0:03 ISTThe advance estimate of 7.1% growth in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the current financial year ending in March 2017 looks good on the face of it, but clearly defies ground reality  a subdued consumer demand and confidence, distressed trade, tentative corporate performance and rural dismay. While releasing the data for the full year with more than a quarter to go, the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) did give a disclaimer about not incorporating the impact of demonetisation in its projections about the countrys growth. The deceleration to 7.1% from 7.6% in the previous fiscal has come about on the back of considerations like global headwinds, retaining Indias status among the fastest-growing economies of the world. But such self-congratulatory report card carries no credibility when vast segments of the economy are in a state of disarray.In the initial days of the note-scrapping exercise, unprecedented anywhere on this scale, Indias micro-small industries reported 35% job losses and 50% dip in revenue, according to a study by the All India Manufacturers Organisation (AIMO). Job losses may go up to 60% and revenue loss to 55% before March 31, the AIMO study further projected. Certain vital sectors of the economy, which are among the largest employment generators, have come to a standstill even as they battle the image of being the parking lot for black money and corruption. Real estate and jewellery industries are almost shut, while tourism, infrastructure, automobile, media, fast-moving consumer goods, transportation, among others are in the grip of a slowdown. Agriculture sector and the entire rural landscape  which had a godly opportunity of rewarding farmers and farm workers, courtesy good monsoon  seem to be squandering away prospective gains as distress sales of onion, tomato, potato and several other crops are being reported from a large number of states following the note ban.The CSO may have managed to give flattering data by some technical and financial jugglery, but the GDP numbers without factoring in the impact of demonetisation are meaningless and are being taken so by the markets and independent analysts. The Finance Ministry, which is busy making the Budget to be presented a month ahead of the conventional last day of February, would do well not to rely too much on the CSO advance estimates while projecting the revenue and expenditure figures for the fiscal 2017-18. With Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley admitting visible impact of the invalidation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes on the economy, an ear to the ground policy would serve better."

This is how things are now. That means this is our last term as Parliament members.

He (Modi) is a smooth talker. He speaks in such a powerful manner that the person hearing him believes there is something to the man...that he must be having a 56-inch chest,"" he said.The Maratha strongman noted that BJP's own ally Shiv Sena had opposed the currency scrap exercise and it should now decide what punishment should be given to the PM for the ""failed"" drive.""Modi said give him 50 days and (if demonetisation didn't succeed, he was willing to bear any punishment people gave him. Shiv Sena is their ally. I read (Sena chief) Uddhav Thackeray's speech where he said in which public square should Modi be made to stand (to accept punishment),"" he said.The former Agriculture Minister said people are bearing the brunt of the note ban exercise which has caused collapse of remunerative prices for vegetable growers.""The promised 50 days are over. Prices of all items have collapsed, be it onions or tomatoes. I had two acres of brinjal crop in my farm. A fortnight ago, I went home and asked my associate who handles the farm work about the earnings from the brinjal crop.""When he gave me the receipt, I said it shows even the transportation cost was not recovered. If this is the plight of a person like me, what will be your situation?"" wondered the veteran Parliamentarian.Modi had heaped praises on the NCP chief at an event in Pune in November where he was invited by Pawar.

The word immediately brings to mind juicy mangoes and family vacations. But with the soaring temperatures, the nasty bacteria and viruses decide to step up their activities as well. Flu, cough and cold, stomach upsets are some minor concerns that can strike anyone. The more serious ones are food and water borne infections like typhoid, cholera, gastroenteritis, food poisoning, and jaundice. Besides, the high amount of sweat gives rise to fungal and yeast infections on the skin.Nutrition will play an important role in beating these blues in summer. A healthy, balanced diet accompanied by regular exercise will do wonders for your health in the summer and beyond. Here are some tips on how to eat healthy during summers:Ban the unsafe foodsStay away from eating raw and cold foods while eating out, especially chutneys, salads, cut fruits, fruit juices or ice creams. While it is tempting to reach out to something cold and refreshing, these are highly likely to cause food borne infections when they are not stored in ambient temperatures. With frequent voltage or power breakdowns, the frozen foods tend to thaw and refreeze, which causes bacteria to multiply. Check the expiry date when buying ice creams and also look for uneven shape or bulges on the ice cream packaging. This could mean the ice cream has melted and again refrozen.HydrateSun burns, heat stroke and severe dehydration are some of the dangers in the scorching summers. The best remedy is to hydrate with clear fluids like plain water, tender coconut water, buttermilk, fresh homemade fruit or vegetable juices. Refrigerated water or other fluids may cause colds and coughs to those sensitive to sudden temperature changes. Using earthen pots to store water, or to set curds, buttermilk is a cool way of getting nourishing fluids in a safely cooled manner. Storing water in copper vessels is also a way of getting some copper ions and staying cool!Stay lightFried foods are heavy and can make you uncomfortable since it takes a long time to digest, and increases thirst. Replace these with shallow fried, grilled or baked foods lighter on your stomach and better for your health. Include a lot of raitas, gravies, and light watery vegetables like gourds, cucumber, melons, tomatoes that are rich in nutrients as well.Get your greensGreen leaves are loaded with vital nutrients including antioxidants, fiber, magnesium, zinc, iron and calcium. The leaves of drumstick, cauliflower, and radish are particularly high in these nutrients. Puree a cup of mixed greens and blend into your dal or roti to get a good dose of disease fighting nutrients.Load up on fruitsOne mango can give you the entire days requirements of Vitamin A! Other summery fruits are there for a reason too. Watermelon which is 80 per cent water, serves to hydrate and refresh, while giving you the necessary electrolytes lost in the sweat. Lychees, which can easily be called the queen of fruits in summers, and musk melon are rich sources of vitamin c that helps protect from colds and coughs.The author is a lead dietician from Manipal Hospitals."

Would you believe if I say it was a mess? (laughs) It started with the spices my parents bought from India. I was helping my sister, who was only a year older than me, to cut vegetables and marinate the meat with tomatoes and that was the fi rst time I smelled cumin and curry powder. I stepped into this fi eld when I was 14. During my summer holidays, I started working at a seafood restaurant to save up for a bike. When I started, I realised it was tough! I learned how to cut the fi sh and clean it before cooking. By the end of the summer, I bought my fi rst bike, and I decided not to give up cooking.Romani AgarwalI joined another restaurant the next summer, and worked with them full-time. For me, cooking is all about fusion. I fuse different cuisines. My one dish called the Tuna Tartar is a fusion of Italian and Asian cuisines. The sesame seeds used in the dish is predominant in Asian cuisines. The sauce is made of mayonnaise mixed with wasabi and horseradish and a little bit of lemon juice. I try to keep my food simple and traditional too at times. Getting to cook a simple traditional dish right is important. A chef should start fusion only when he has enough experience.I have noticed that cooking the simplest food is the most diffi cult. For instance, I have had pasta which was overcooked and smelled like oregano. Few main ingredients I always need in my kitchen are tomato pelati, extra-virgin olive oil (because its lighter), parmesan cheese, and parma ham. Having stayed in India for the past seven to eight years, I started using the herbs that I get here. I prefer using organic vegetables as it gives the food a genuine taste.I remember when we were young we used to steal tomatoes from trees and eat it raw. The taste of the tomatoes is still embedded in my mind that I try to fi nd that smell when I buy tomatoes for my kitchen. Cooking used to be a big task in my family. My mother and grandmother used to get up early in the morning to prepare. Even today, I try to rememeber the taste of their food and remake the dishes from my childhood. I love cooking for my family, but that happens only when I am in Italy. I cook with my brotherin- law who is also a chef. My wife is the queen of the kitchen there (laughs) she says that I make too much mess and wont let me cook."

He wrongly thought that it was a done deal. It's not a done deal.""Le Pen herself joined the bashing, saying ""all French people saw that he had the feeling he'd already won. It's not very respectful of democracy, of the voters"".Reprising her depiction of Macron as a product of the elite, she said he had celebrated with the ""arrogant caste that thinks... it can do anything it wants with the country.""Turbo-chargedSince securing her berth in the runoff, Le Pen has turbo-charged her campaign with a string of appearances and statements, leaving her opponent on the back foot.At the crack of dawn on Tuesday she was at the sprawling Rungis food market outside Paris, taking aim at what she said was Macron's desire for ""total deregulation, total opening up, total free trade"".In contrast, her opponent has huddled in strategy meetings over June legislative elections that will determine the shape of a future Macron government.Polls suggest that Macron will trounce Le Pen in the runoff with a margin of some 20 points.But after the political shocks of Britain's vote to leave the European Union and Donald Trump's unlikely ascent to the White House, analysts say a late surge by Le Pen is still possible.Macron has his work cut out to give people ""positive reasons"" to vote for him, said Guillaume Goubert, editor of the daily La Croix, noting that many voters had chosen him in the first round out of a desire to block other candidates rather than out of any real fervour.Le Pen says she is the only candidate for change in a deeply divided country burdened by high unemployment and inequality.""Nothing in either Mr Macron's policies or his behaviour suggests the slightest proof of his love for France,"" she said on Monday. ""We are going to win.""The candidate had a mixed reception at Rungis, where she drew boos -- and ducked a flying tomato -- over a pledge to deport all illegal immigrants.""We're workers too. We pay our taxes,"" a fruit vendor shouted. ""It's a disgrace,"" another said repeatedly.Also Monday, Le Pen said she was quitting temporarily as head of her National Front (FN) party in order to concentrate on the campaign.The move was seen as largely symbolic but one that would loosen her association with the FN, the party founded by Le Pen's father, Jean-Marie, notorious for anti-Semitic and xenophobic remarks.Homage to slain policemanEarlier Tuesday, the rival candidates attended a sombre ceremony honouring a policeman killed on the Champs-Elysees last week.Macron and Le Pen stood grim-faced among hundreds of mourners as Xavier Jugele's gay partner delivered a moving eulogy to the 37-year-old officer, whose shooting was claimed by the Islamic State group.""I suffer without hatred,"" Etienne Cardiles said at the ceremony led by Hollande at Paris police headquarters.Cardiles was echoing the sentiment of the husband of a victim of the November 2015 jihadist attack on Paris's Bataclan concert hall who said to the perpetrators: ""You won't have my hatred.""Macron and Le Pen differ starkly on how to protect France, still reeling from a string of jihadist attacks since 2015 that has claimed more than 230 lives.Le Pen has called for France to take back control of its borders from the European Union and deport all foreigners on a terror watchlist, accusing Macron of being soft on terrorism.Macron has urged voters not to ""give in to fear"" and vowed to step up security cooperation with EU partners.Analysts say that alongside security, the economy will likely dominate a critical TV debate between the two candidates on May 3."
5922be767be9e01fceefaa9a,"Devotees get cake, burger prasadam",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/607727/devotees-get-cake-burger-prasadam.html,2017-04-22,,Deccan Herald,"Devotees get cake, burger prasadamR Sathyanarayana in Chennai, Apr 22 2017, 23:41 ISTTamil Nadu temple is breaking barriersPrasadam being served to devotees.Temple has installed prasadam vending machinesFamous Venkateswara temple at Tirumala in Andhra Pradesh is known for its laddu prasadam. Similarly, Murgan temple at Palani in Tamil Nadu is famous for its Panchamirtham. Most of the temples across the country serve traditional food as prasadam.However, the traditional prasadams such as laddu, jaggery rice and dhal pongal have become pass at a temple on the outskirts of Chennai. The Jaya Durga Peetam temple at Padappai serves burgers and brownies along with mineral water to devotees. The temple, spread over one acre, is in Oragadam taluk, about 40 km from Chennai.The stylish western type prasadam also includes cakes (without egg), sandwiches, vegetable cutlets, tomato salads and phulkas and they are neatly packed. The temple also offers health drinks, including badam milk.The food is cooked or baked in the temple kitchen, which is certified by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India. The temple also has a well-maintained dining hall. The prasadam, served free of charge, carries manufacturing and best before dates on every packet.The service is also hi-tech. Devotees can collect boxes of prasadam from vending machine installed at the temple's automated kitchen. The prasadam is a big hit not only among locals but also among devotees from different places.One man who has made all these possible is Dr K Sri Sridar, a herbal oncologist. Sridar, who established the temple, says that the worship place was like other temples in the beginning. However, he wanted to make the temple formalities little different not only for offering hygienic prasadam but also for attracting children to worship god.The kumbabishekam for the temple was performed in 1996. At that time it was like any other temple. When I noticed that priests were serving prasadam by hands, I thought it was unhygienic. Then, I decided to change it in my temple, Sridar said.To start with Jaya Durga Peetam temple offered hygienic packed food, including rotis, dal and mixed rice regularly. Later, I thought why not introduce burger and other attractive food items. I elicited the opinions of several people and the response was positive, Sridar said.But, when I started serving cakes and burgers as prasadam, I faced stiff opposition from some temples as they felt my act is against the temple practices as prescribed in the Hindu religion. However, I ignored them and went ahead with my initiative, which attracted several children. The opposition slowly died down, he said.We ensure that prasadam is not repeated in the week. However, burger, cakes, sandwich and brownies are severed only on Saturdays and Sundays so that children and students can come to the temple not only to worship but also for the prasadam, Sridar said.After performing pooja, every devotee will be given a token to get prasadam through the vending machine. Sridar was not satisfied with the introduction of attractive prasadams. He felt that the devotees should get clean drinking water also. I have made sure that every devotee gets 500 ml clean water to quench their thirst after they enter the temple, he said.The temple, which runs through donations, opens at 6 am and closes at 12 noon. In the evenings, darshan will be between 4 pm and 8 pm. Another uniqueness is that the temple has no hundi (cash collection box) on the temple premises. Even the priests will not receive any offerings from the devotees for conducting poojas, Sridar said.He said that by the grace of god they have not faced dearth of people coming to sponsor the day's expenses. On occasions, devotees donate for food and flowers for one week. We will pick the bill if no devotee comes forward to sponsor the day's pooja and prasadam. Daily, about 100 devotees offer pooja at the temple. On special occasions, the figure touches 1,000, Sridar added. However, he declined to disclose the amount donors will have to pay for the daily service.Explaining functioning of the temple, Sridar said, We purchase items required for a particular day and expenses are borne by donors. The payment is directly made to the shop, Sridar said.Not only with prasadam, the temple is slightly hi-tech in welcoming the devotees. Keeping with changed times, the devotees will have to register their names and provide their mobile numbers. They are welcomed by the temple authorities through SMSes. The devotees also get regular alerts on the important poojas and rituals that are to be performed in the temple on auspicious days.The temple's doors are open for celebrating events like birthdays. They are allowed to cut the cake and blow candles. Recently 82-year-old Subbulakshmi, who had never celebrated her birthday, came to the temple with her children and cut a big cake.As a doctor, Sridar says that elderly people, who want to perform ""Angapradhashanam"" (rolling on the floor around the temple) should check their blood pressure before performing it. Besides me, lab technicians will be in the temple to check the BP of old people. If the devotees are not fit, we will not allow them to perform Angapradhashanam, he said.The temple has already banned use of camphor and plastic inside the premises. The management provides hair driers for devotees taking head bath before doing Angapradhashanam.In the next phase of improvement, the temple management is planning smart card system for the devotees to enable them to open the door and enter the temple. Many ATM kiosks have adopted the same."

The market is abuzz with products fashionably advertised as organic  from daily consumables like shampoos and soaps to offbeat designer clothes! The word organic is ad nauseam and some products slyly pass off as inherently good just because they are simply tagged so. Now, here is the dilemma when buying. How much organic is too organic; because organic products usually cost more.It seems people world over are leading robust lives and eating healthy; but they are unwittingly ingesting insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, rodenticides, molluscicides, nematicides, plant growth regulators among others. There is way too much chemicals in food chains than is good. These compounds synthesised artificially to boost productivity in modern scientific farms are ALL toxic. Crop yields have increased dramatically but unscrupulous practices have left behind a lethal cocktail of dangerous compounds. They are an inseparable part of common lifestyles, food preferences and diets. Many studies link pesticides in foods with various ailments without doubt, from IQ loss to cancer! It is now an obvious no brainier to prefer nutritious and safe organic foods for long-term wellness.Many plant-based foods are industrially produced with genetically modified technologies or retailed with high residual pesticides. Based on the 2015 Report of the Environmental Working Group (EWG), an O-List (Organic Must Buy List!) was published. These are highly recommended edibles that should be bought organic even if they dent monthly food budgets. Here are some pointers that will make extra spend on organic alternates worthwhile at the grocers.Fruits with thin skins like apples, peaches, pears, grapes and strawberries are all on the O-List. Research publications show that 99% of apples contain at least one residual pesticide ... and 15 different types of pesticides are typically found on grapes.When it comes to veggies, the dirtiest are potatoes and spinach. It seems definitely worthwhile to go organic on these household staples. Also on the veggie O-list are ladies finger, tomatoes, cucumber, corn, capsicum and most other leafy greens.Dairy products like milk, cheese and yogurt rank high on the O-list. Certified organic dairy products are from cows and buffaloes reared entirely on organic feeds without antibiotics or growth hormones. Non-vegetarians must beware that conventional meat contains all these deadly chemicals in good measure. After all most cows, chicken, and other animals are reared with additives to spur meat production in commercial enterprises intent to maximise returns on investment.It seems only fair to counter the O-list with a clean-list of foods where it is just fine and safe to buy conventional such as bananas, which have a thick skin. Others include watermelon, pineapple, papaya, musk melon, mangoes and kiwi. Vegetables like drumsticks, onions, cauliflower, cabbage (red/white or purple), brinjal, peas, pumpkin, gourds, mushrooms and sweet potatoes find mention here. Amongst the less common vegetables included in the clean list are avocadoes and asparagus.So there we have it folks: O-list vs clean-list! Choose smartly and keep your wallet happy!"

But this is the flood plain of Cauvery, and the depth of his two functional borewells indicate how deep the river has sank. One is 1,100ft and the other 900ft, reports Thavasi. The speed of water from the second one has gone down, and Im scared itll stop working soon.Thavasi is lucky to have any water at all. Smaller farmers cant afford to burrow so deep. Im just lucky because there is still some ground water left in Kannamoochi, he says.Salem is big on horticulture. Orchards occupy roughly 25 percent of all cultivable land: chillies, turmeric, plantain, tapioca, areca nut, tomatoes and other vegetables. The famous Salem mangoes are grown in Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri.This year, inflorescence was promising in January, but never came. Now farmer R Venkatachalam of Vanavasi village is showing us the fruit of his labour. Its a tiny Kiimooku that fits into the pit of his palm. Kiimookus grow to 300gm, but this one is 100gm.Venkatachalam and his brother Raju R struggled all spring to irrigate the 600 trees they have in their 10-acre orchard. They bought dozens of 5,000-litre tankerloads, each for Rs 600-700. But the deliveries were never prompt. Other farmers needed water too.In the village, another farmer, P Kasigounder, reels off his losses: 25 percent in 2015, 50 percent in 2016 and 85 percent this summer. I lost Rs 3 lakh, says Kasigounder. The kind government offered Rs 5,900 as drought relief.Further off from the Mettur Dam, we stop at the field of Selvaraj R in Kolathur. Its barely 8km from Stanley, but his chilli field is cinder-dry with his cattle scrounging for tufts of grass. A chilli field beyond him has been baked bronze. Selvaraj plucks a pepper and holds it up by the stalk like a scientist would a lab rat. How will anybody buy this! he sighs.Kolathur chillis are known for their kick on the palate. They are the flavourful condiment vathal milagai you get with South Indian food. The local trick is to allow the chillies to ripen and dry in the field and take them straight to the shandy (market). This year, the pods didnt stand a chance.The Kolathur chilli crop yields five or six harvests in 15-day intervals during the February-May period. This year, farmers lost 80-90 percent of it. The crop withered even before the first harvest.The February-March period was a desperate time in horticulture villages like Thalaivasal. One farmer, P Kalayarasan, said he struggled to keep his crop alive as his only borewell began to die. We spent Rs 25,000 to save our chilli field. It was of no use, he said. Now we dont have water for cattle.Some five per cent of the crop made it to the market in the Thalaivasal block this year. With time on his hands, Kalayarasan remembers the good times: During peak seasons, we used to bring chillies to the shandy in 10-15 bicycles and sold it at Rs 150 per kg. It wasnt only short-duration crops like chilli that didnt survive. Coconut and areca nut groves gave horticulturists as much grief.Areca begins yielding in three years and lives up to 35. But 65 percent of the trees died in Salem district this year. Farmer Pandian P said that 2015 hadnt been a good year either, but his two borewells saved him. In 2017, both gave up.How some beat the droughtDrip, drip, dripAmidst the vast expanse of dry fields in Kannampoochi village, one tiny field of plantain, belonging to farmer Thavasi, looked like it had a tinge of green. At the foot of the boles, a black pipe snakes along the ridges on which the plantain saplings grow. Drip irrigation trickled into Salem about a decade ago and it is gaining popularity given that drought has blighted the region.This year, Thavasi has made a profit because, although banana production fell due to drought, the drip saved his crop. If a well irrigates one acre of land, a drip takes care of two-three acres, he says. I dont think I would have had a crop without it.The districts horticulture department offers a total subsidy to small farmers (those owning less than 5 acres) and a 75 per cent subsidy to big farmers. However, drip irrigations popularity is restricted to plantains and tapioca. It has not spread to other crops.Plastic mulchAnother new technique used by vegetable and tapioca farmers is plastic mulch  a long sheet of plastic with several circular holes in it. Several acres of vegetables are grown in these holes. These mulches reduce evaporation, control growth of weed and can be re-used for a second harvest, a horticulture official says. Between 2014 and 2016 over 100 hectares of land were mulched in Salem. This technique is applied alongside drip irrigation.Pitcher irrigationPitcher irrigation is another strategy implemented in some parts of the district. An earthen pot with a lid on top and holes at the bottom is buried in the soil. Crops, particularly vegetables, are sown around the pitcher. This ensures water does not evaporate and reaches only the roots. But the technique is less popular than mulching.Go tapiocaTapioca is used for making sago and starch. Salem contributes to about one-third of all sago produced in India. Although tapioca is drought-resistant, its cultivation has gone down by half, according to the horticulture department. If tapioca gets affected by a drought, chances are that the situation is very severe, a senior official said."

And there, at the hotel we were staying in, was a little restaurant. A neat space, well decorated and with an air of cheery hospitality. The temple was a stones throw away, the days were bright and sunny, and the food was good.Its at the little places that one meets the most surprising and delightful people. Here it was an elderly, genial man, always smiling. He wasnt around in the daytime it seemed, because I didnt see him then. After a visit to the temple one evening, we found ourselves back at the restaurant for dinner.It was a pleasant time, right after the sun had set, and not too deep into the night. When someone asked for an order of fried rice, he looked doubtful. Itll be too much for one person, he said, guessing that the others would want to eat something else. Therell be a lot left over, he added, and the fried rice, on his suggestion, was replaced with a masala dosa. Of that he approved, because the portion was just right. Moreover, the dosa was crisp, filled with tomatoes and potatoes, an unusual dosa, drizzled with ghee.I know these things, he remarked cheerfully. When youve worked at restaurants as long as I have, you just know what someone would like. You look at people, and you can guess what theyd want to eat. I knew, he added with a grin, that youd order fried rice, that itll be too much, and then youll order a dosa instead. All this was said in warm good humour. He left us to our meal, but came back once or twice to ask about the food. He offered more sambar, filling up our katoris, and knew exactly when the katoris might be empty or full. After the meal, we were wondering what to drink. Have a Horlicks, in hot milk, he suggested. It goes really very well with the dosa. Naturally, thats what was ordered. After the meal, we told him the food was delicious (which it was), and he was delighted. And through it all, he continued to smile.In a world that is short on courtesy, and where curt responses are more common than they should be, folks like him are rare indeedfolks who have experience in their work and remain cheerful, well-mannered and considerate towards those they meet. Amidst the chaos, theres something refreshing about those who speak optimistically, and thoughtfullythose who may have their own problems, and who doesnt, after all, and still smile. Most of all, individuals such as these, remarkable in their own way, unknown to the larger world perhaps but remembered by those who meet themthese are the people who make life just a little brighter, just a little happier, a little sunnier.Email: suryakantham3@yahoo.com"

Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidus vision is to make the State a horticulture hub and increase the net area sown by horticulture crops from the 20% to 35% in the next three years.The benefits of fertigation over the conventional or drop-fertilizing methods include increased nutrient absorption, reduction of fertilizer and water needed and greater control in the application of nutrients.There is a reduction in soil erosion because the nutrients are pumped through the water drip system. Leaching of nutrients from the soil is also decreased.The government is going to promote innovative technologies like off-season, protected cultivation of vegetables and flowers in poly houses and shade net houses, pandal system of vegetable cultivation, using of trellis for tomato cultivation to increase yield and mulching for gourds and melons to increase production and net-returns for farmers.As many as 6.25 lakh farmers micro-irrigating crops are benefiting from various schemes under the A.P. Micro Irrigation Project (APMIP), according to the Planning Department.Net returnAccording to a third party evaluation of the impact of micro irrigation on the net returns to farmers conducted by the NABCONS Consultancy Services and Agriculture Finance Corporation (AFC), there has been a minimum of 25% increase in net income per hectare due to micro-irrigation.Mango showed the highest increase of 50% on net income including the saving on water and energy. The following are the crops and the percentage increase in net return on income due to the impact of micro irrigation: mango 50%, sweet orange 27%, acid lime 25%, guava 25%, banana 42 %, papaya 27%, vegetables 40%, tomato 39%, maize 22% and mulberry 40 %.The State government is implementing strategies to make Rayalaseema as a horticulture hub.The government has set for itself a target of covering 10 lakh farmers in the next three years under the Farmer Producer Organisations (FPO) for agriculture and allied sectors for the formation of linkages to market the States products, globally."

5922c3ea7be9e01fe6dfa84b,Doubling our farm incomes,http://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/2017/mar/25/doubling-our-farm-incomes-1585549.html,2017-03-25,,The New Indian Express,"Last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the governments goal of doubling the farmers income by 2022. Simple math tells us that this would require the farmers income to rise by around 12 per cent per year on average, over the next five years. This is in nominal terms, i.e. not adjusted for inflation. Its an audacious goal if you consider the fact that agriculture growth (in real terms) has never averaged more than five per cent over any continuous five-year period, in recent history. Thats because of two reasons.Firstly, agricultural productivity cannot rise steeply year after year, and secondly the area under cultivation cannot expand rapidly and continuously. Modest increase is possible, but not exponential. Besides, prices may remain stable, denying any nominal rupee gains. In addition to all this are the risks associated with agriculture, which are monsoon failure, pest attacks, spurious seeds, adverse weather shocks, etc., all of which contribute to making the goal truly audacious.But if you read the Prime Ministers goal carefully, you will notice that it is to double the farmers income, not agricultural production per se. Hence it is possible that the farmer may have some non-agricultural sources of income. Indeed, the services sector activities in rural areas have been increasing substantially, providing livelihoods to many. But more importantly, what if we increased the share of the overall national income pie that accrues to the farmer? It is this approach that holds the greatest promise of increasing incomes to the farmer.There are two aspects to the incomes associated with the food and cash crop economies. First, in case of fruits and vegetables, the difference between what the city dweller pays for the tomatoes, and what the farmer actually receives is huge. City folk pay four times the cost, attributable to reasons like transport, losses, entry taxes and fat margins for middlemen. If some of these inefficiencies are removed, a larger share can go to the farmer. The dismantling of the provisions of the Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act in many states is ensuring the reduction of this gap. So also is the establishment of electronic national agriculture market. Any mechanism to connect buyers and sellers directly can benefit the farmer, as long as he retains some bargaining power.The other aspect of increasing income share to farmers, is through value added agriculture, namely agro-processing. This has immense potential. The groundnut may fetch only forty rupees a kilo to the farmer, but when it becomes masala coated peanuts in a fancy packaging, it fetches four hundred rupees a kilo. The same is true for oranges and orange juice, or bananas and banana chips. There is almost an infinite range of agro-processing products possible, which can retain freshness, flavour and taste of produce, through a combination of technologies like nitrogen or vacuum packing, or freeze-drying.Some of the products that have become very popular in a short time are wet idli mix, instant upma and noodles, fresh juices including pomegranate and lychees, jowar chips and so on. All of these products require investment, working capital, marketing, advertising and efficient distribution. The growth of conventional consumer food companies is an indication of the great potential. But the trick is to ensure that farmers garner a proportionate share of the increase in and income that comes from agro-processing.This is where the farmer producer organisations (FPOs) come in. These are hybrid organisations combining features of a shareholder-owned company and cooperatives. The FPO structure was formally introduced under Company Law, to enable farmers to become shareholders. This ensures they have clout and bargaining power when dealing with consumers, small or big (such as organised retail supermarket chains). If a farmer sells groundnuts to a buyer, then no sales tax, VAT or now GST is applicable. But if an FPO sells salted peanut packets then all kinds of taxes become applicable. This defeats the economic viability since profit margins are slim and overheads can be large, especially when the scale is small. It is here that policy intervention is needed to ensure healthy growth of FPOs around the country.Not all crops and agri-products are amenable to be produced within an FPO structure. The success of FPOs depends also on them holding their own against FMCG companies, assessing consumer tastes and preferences, ensuring quality and offering competitive pricing. But because the demand is so large, those FPOs that manage these challenges well are bound to increase the incomes of their shareholders, i.e. farmers, immensely.For far too long the farm sector was neglected or has suffered from muddled policies and inefficient implementation. By making the goal of doubling farmers income in five years, the PM has brought the right focus to the problem. In addition, well need investment in irrigation, better water management (another of the PMs slogan, more crop per drop), dismantling APMC-like shackles, more seamless connect between buyer and seller and proactive policies for FPOs to flourish.A good monsoon last year ensured that agriculture growth would be close to nine percent in the second half this fiscal. Some states like Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are reporting even higher, double-digit growth rates. Sub sectors like horticulture, dairy, livestock, show promise of high growth in incomes. While conventional policy push should continue and strengthen, we also need a push to ensure the profits from agroprocessing go predominantly to the farmer. Thats the only way to reach the goal of doubling his income.(Syndicate: The Billion press)Ajit RanadeSenior economist based in MumbaiEmail: editor@thebillionpress.org"

The farmers of Kalvarayan hills and the villages surrounding Vazhappadi used to market their produce through the whole sale dealers running godowns in Vazhappadi town. The tomatoes are auctioned daily and a large number of traders from the western belt and neighbouring states participate in the same. The harvesting season has just commenced in Kalvarayan hills. This has led to bulk arrival of tomatoes to the Vazhappadi wholesale traders. A box containing 27  30 kg of tomatoes has been priced between Rs. 150 and Rs. 200."
