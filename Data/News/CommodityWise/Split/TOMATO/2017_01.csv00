The farmers invested some Rs. 42,000 for mulching process apart from setting up drip irrigation system in their farms. They cultivated tomato in another five acres in the conventional method.Low pricesBy the time the crop was ready to be harvested the price of tomato crashed. The farmers were left with no option but to leave the crop to rot in the field. At the price prevailing in the market then they would not even realise the cost of harvesting and transport to the market. All the man days they have invested in the farm, labour cost and other investments have gone down the drain.The case of Abdul Rehman, few kilometres away, is no different. He owns some four acres and he decided to take on lease another eight acres and he cultivated carrot in two acres and tomato in another two acres.Rotting in the fieldAll his efforts yielded a bumper crop and he expected good returns. The fate did not favour him and market crashed.The situation was so bad that the prevailing market price would not even cover the cost of harvesting and cleaning the crop for market. The crop has been in the field beyond 90 days and today the healthy-looking carrots have rotted inside.For drip Mr. Rehman has invested Rs. 25,000 while Rs. 75,000 subsidy was offered by the government.I made a total investment of Rs. 25,000 for each acre and the accumulated loss for the crop is about Rs. 1 lakh. Every day I have to pay Rs. 200 for labour transport as they have to come from Sangareddy or Kandi, Mr. Rehman told The Hindu .He is regretting his having chosen to cultivate vegetables over cotton."

KarthikeyanG_KARTHIKEYAN;G_KARTHIKEYAN - G_KARTHIKEYANAcute drought and sharp depletion of groundwater table weighed down horticulturists at several villages in Dindigul union. The worst-affected were drumstick growers.Chettiyapatti, Kalikampatti, Munnilaikottai, Nadupatti and adjacent areas were major drumstick production centres in the union. Drumstick has also been cultivated as intercrop in tomato and onion fields.Several farmers preferred hybrid plant variety of drumstick to traditional variety for better yield and little maintenance.Already, several bore wells and open wells at these villages dried up owing to the acute drought, creating a shortage of water for irrigation. Residents have been running from pillar to post for water for drinking and other purposes.With no sources to maintain regular supply, horticulturists have started purchasing water from Dindigul and nearby areas to protect the standing crops.S. Palani, farmer in Kalikkampatti, said though drumstick crop was drought- tolerant, a minimum quantity of water was required to keep the plant alive.The plants should be irrigated at least once in two or three days. We had to shell out a sizable amount of money for water. Suppliers deliver water in lorries and tractors, he added.Intermittent showers in the past two days brought some relief. But it was only temporary and it would not help the horticulturists in the long run, he added.The farmers in area said already debt burden had been haunting many who had small land holdings.Several fund- starved farmers were in distress as they could not afford to buy water to protect the standing crops. Now their fate was in the hands of rain god, they said."

Pandanna of Killoiguda Mana Vittana Kendra. Seed festivals in villages still follow it by decorating the tree with seeds.Minor millets like ""samalu"" (five varieties), ""chollu"" (10 varieties) and Korralu (10 varieties), corn, rajma, paddy including scented varieties, tomato, garlic, beans etc. are prominently displayed at the 16 stalls.A small tomato called ""Cherry tomato"" grows on creepers in East Godavari, according to organisers of Laya, an NGO, that displayed it.It is not cooked but eaten as a fruit and fetches a good price, they said.Tribal farmers go by utility too. Nallajeedi is used as a medicine and as a part of the string containing lemon and red chilli to ward off evil eye. It has good demand and is sold in tribal fairs, says a farmer.The seed is neatly packed with names written showing the preparedness of NGOs and tribal farmers involved to the task of a preliminary selection to pave the way for seed exchange."

Turn to Ayurveda,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2017/feb/04/want-beautiful-skin-turn-to-ayurveda-1566673.html,2017-02-04,"HYDERABAD: Beauty isnt skin deep, it goes much deeper. Skin being the most absorbent organ of the body, requires special care. With the environment already unleashing high level of toxins on our health, its time to be alert about not just our lifestyle, what we eat, drink and even breathe, but also what we apply on your body. This is where Ayurveda come to your rescue. Unlike beauty regimens, Ayurveda is ideal for all skin types.In conversation with Hyderabad Express, Dr GG Gangadharan, Director Ramaiah Indic Specialty Ayurveda, Ayurvedic advisor, Lever Ayush, reveals why it is time to throw those bottles and tubes of creams and packs, and head to the kitchen and fridge instead.We often witness college-goers wrap their faces in dupattas to keep away the pollution but it still gets to them. Suggest some skin care routine.Wash face with lukewarm water mixed with 1tsp honey and 1 tsp lemon juice twice a day (in the morning and as soon as you reach home). Massage face and neck with oil which helps in enhancing complexion like Chemparathyadi Coconut oil (based with hibiscus) and Nalpamaradi Coconut oil (Based on Nalpamara viz., Ficus family and Turmeric). These medicines are available in all Ayurvedic pharmacies. If you are used to drinking milk, boil garlic (3 gms, peeled, washed and crushed) in 1 cup of milk, filter and take it internally at bed time. Alternatives are: honey (1 tsp) mixed with 1 glass of lemon water or carrot juice mixed with orange juice. This regular routine will help clear the pores of the face and keep the skin fresh.Models and creative artistes put on a lot of makeup viz., toner, primer, foundation etc. What kind of Ayurvedic products can one use to protect skin from an onslaught of such cosmetics?Generally synthetic ingredients cannot give any textural enhancement, and some of them are even harmful to the skin if used over long periods. It is better to protect the skin on a daily basis by mild face massage with Nalpamaradi Coconut oil/ Nisoushiradi tailam/ Eladi Coconut oil and face steam with tulsi (Basil leaves) water. Doing this on a regular basis shall help to open the clogged pores and remove the impurities thereby preventing harm to skin. Later cleanse the face with any vegetable pulp (e.g., cucumber/ tomato Pulp) or fruits like orange pulp/ fresh black grapes pulp. Then wash your face with fresh lukewarm water and put face mask with fine coriander powder with coconut milk and honey. Regular maintenance with above said facial care shall help maintain the skin texture and tone.Suggest a few tips on combating the pollutants in the city traffic.To protect from the pollutants in the traffic, it is better to scrub the face with a handful of incha (bark of the climber Acacia intsia, traditionally used for bathing after Ayurveda oil massage) which is available in all Ayurveda stores. Then wash with lukewarm water and gently massage with pure coconut oil and face steam with lemon water (cut the lemon into pieces and boil in water). Then massage the face, neck, shoulder with a paste of green gram boiled in milk and honey. Along with this, hydrate face with cooked rice water. Apply, face pack with carrot, tomato pulp.Suggest some personal care across the day using five or six proven Ayurvedic tips.The best method of personal care is using regular oil bath. This routine can be done at home or at an Ayurveda centre. Oil like pure coconut oil/ sesame oil can be used. An Ayurveda doctor will be able to select a suitable oil based on your body nature and general constitution.Exercise and Yoga enables one to improve inhalation of more oxygen and thereby purifies the body. This aids cell repair (hair follicle included) and activates metabolism.Early to bed, early to rise and early morning bowel evacuation is important for healthy body and skin.Regular eye wash and application of medicated collyrium (anjana) is important to maintain eye health.Regular foot massage during bed time after cleaning feet is advisable which helps to relax the nerves of body and ensures good sleep. It also helps to protect the eyes.Wholesome food habitsProactive in performing regular, designated and rightful duties towards oneselfand for the nation.Does loose hair touching cheeks cause any harm to the skin? If yes, then what can be doneabout it?Hair is of elastic nature. Continuous rubbing can scar the skin thereby reducing the softness of cheeks. Apply a cream made by swirlingbutter in turmeric (Kastoorimanjal) and honey on cheeks.What do you think are fiveessentials that every youngster in a polluted city must consume everyday to maintain good health and clear skin?Avoid Constipation. Hydrate the body tissues by regularly drinking adequate water.Accelerate the skin peeling process by having regular bath after body massage with oil.Regeneration of body cells is essential which can be enhanced by regular intake of amalaki, ghee, honey and milk.Staple food specific to the region should be consumed. Eat seasonal fruits and vegetablesAyurveda advises to take green gram soup and horse gram soup which help in maintaining the minerals, vitamins and protein required for the body. Green gram soup recipe: Soak a handful of green gram dhal overnight. Pressure cook the same until it is well cooked. Strain it and season the juice with pure ghee and salt to taste.Dr GG Gangadharan, Director Ramaiah Indic Specialty Ayurveda, Ayurvedic advisor, Lever Ayush"

The meat is chewy and the creamy coleslaw retains a bite. This heavy is topped with a sunny-side-up egg, which has soft edges. On the side, you get lightly toasted, crisp slices of bread, (too sweet) baked beans, herbed and grilled potatoes, (indifferently) grilled tomato and a cup of tea or coffee or juice. If you can have this and still manage a dessert, you should audition for Man v/s Food.The Ham Basket, despite its few weak links, makes for a great breakfast.If you like something lighter, stick to the pancakes. They are fluffy and mildly sweetened and the chef makes them with soyamilk on request (if you are intolerant to dairy). I suggest the pancakes with maple syrup (a common favourite) and pancakes with caramelised bananas. If you have a sweet tooth, you can order these with whipped cream and any of the fruity crushes.I havent tried their coffee but their teas are worth going back for. I have gone back to have their ginger tea, it is watery and generous with the ginger. Their pot of masala tea, with the same consistency and the strong flavour, is also a good order. These cups are for mornings before a brisk walk in the sun or, for evenings, to wake you up for polite conversations.The Srilankan Curry with Steamed Rice and Salad is thick with coconut milk. Therefore, it is mostly bland but the salad goes perfectly with it. The salad has purple and green cabbage, mixed with shredded coconut and crushed peanuts. You may bite an occasional slice of chilli in it.The salad comes with the Malaysian Chicken Massaman Curry with Steamed Rice too. This one, blander than the Srilankan dish, has lightly cooked potatoes and soft pieces of chicken in it.Spicy Prawn Curry with Mint Rice and Peanut Salad is more tomato based and tastes like sambar as a friend said. This does not take away from its goodness and the mint in the rice is more a nudge, than a push.In the desserts, we try the waffle with vanilla ice cream. This smells of a warm kitchen with fresh loaves of bread and the ice cream is whisked to the right smoothness. That said, if you do not like eggs or the smell of eggs, dont have this.Price for two: Rs 1,000 (mains and tea)"

But I initially started off as a student of hotel management in Thanjavur. I worked in prominent hotel groups in Coonoor and Coorg where I honed my skills.Sunish P SurendranI have also had the opportunity to work on some government project (on a contract), while also occasionally lending a hand to aspiring chefs at culinary institutes. My style of cuisine is mostly Mediterranean  the one thing that I love about it is that it is so varied in style!The Mediterranean belt consists of nearly 21 countries from Turkey, Cyprus, Italy, France, Morocco and several North African countries, each with similar preparation style with tweaks in names and ingredients. So it gives you regional variations of the same dish, which is fascinating to cook. One of my favourite Mediterranean dishes is Tajine which is from North Africa. It has steamed meat, vegetables, and spices cooked in clay earthen pots. It is a very popular main course dish that can be adapted to Indian style of cooking as well. Mostly, it is served along with couscous.Another favourite of mine is the Ratatouille. I also served as the Chef Garde Manager (keeper of the food) at several hotels where I was in charge of the cold cuts and salad sections. Im equally adept at whipping up favourites like Caesars and Greek salads in veg and non-veg combinations. I prefer to use homemade products rather than sourced products. I prefer fresh herbs for cooking that I handpick from the market.The thing about Mediterranean is that it can easily be adapted as fusion food; in fact, Tajine is most commonly made with tomato puree that gives it a sour taste which Indians may not find palatable. So I make it with our own Indian garam masala and spices and grind them to give it a unique taste and aroma! Your cooking will not be worth the hard work if you do not have a presentation style that suits the dish, only then will the customer also feel satisfied. You have to cook a dish like you are cooking it for yourself for it to actually come out well."

She cited that the vegetables in the village were way much cheaper than in Sambalpur city.In the village, potato was being sold at Rs 5 per kg, one and half kg of tomato for Rs 10, drum sticks for Rs 20 and cabbage for Rs 3 per kg. On the other hand, potato is selling for Rs 8 a kilo, tomato Rs 10 per kg and drum sticks Rs 35 per kg in the city.A view of the vegetable market in Sambalpuron Saturday | ExpressWhile traders attribute the difference in prices to transportation and porter cost besides levy imposed by Regulated Market Committees, failure of authorities concerned to rein in the vendors seems to have led the farmers to such a situation.The tall promises made by the BJD Government to provide 35 per cent irrigation in each block besides cold storage across the State remain unfulfilled. Blame it on the indifference of the administration which has left the vegetable growers and farmers at the mercy of vendors, who never fail to exploit them.The prices of vegetables were much lower a week ago and began rising with the rise in mercury level.Green chilli, which is available at Rs 24 per kg in the village, is sold at Rs 40 in town and city markets, tomato is priced at Rs 120 for 25 kg (Rs 4.80 a kg) and sold at Rs 10 per kg, brinjal around Rs 6 against market price of Rs 10 to Rs 12 per kg, cucumber is sold by farmers at Rs 15 per kg while it costs Rs 20 in the market. On the other hand, there is a margin of Rs 10 in one kg of coriander leaves which is purchased at Rs 30 and sold at Rs 40, beans are priced at Rs 20 and sold at Rs 30.But, the summer vegetables of pointed gourd (potal) and ladies finger are expensive as of now with pointed gourd being sold by farmers at Rs 70 a kg. The same is sold between Rs 90 and Rs 120, ladies finger is sold in open market at Rs 50 per kg while farmers are selling it at Rs 30 per kg.It is the cabbage growers who have been badly hit with many failing to recover even the harvesting cost. A bag containing 40 kg cabbage is available for Rs 100 even as it is being sold at Rs 6 per kg in the open market, while cauliflower is being purchased from growers at Rs 12 to Rs 14 and sold by vendors at Rs 20.Onion growers too are crying tears of neglect. In Titlagarh, the Nashik of Odisha, distress sale was reported. Although it has been two years since an integrated pack house was developed by APICOL, mere transfer of land to install the transformer to electrically charge the pack house has denied the onion growers to stock their produce and sell it when prices soar."

Yet to recover from the crop loss of 2015-16 kharif season, they were forced to go for distress sale of cabbage, tomato and chilli and now it is the turn of potato.The farmers had put all their hopes on potato and looked forward to make up for the loss. Even as potato is being sold for `8 per kg in the open market, the farmers are finding it difficult to even recover the cost of cultivation with traders offering anything between `2 and `3 per kg. In the absence of cold storage, the farmers have no way out but to dispose of the produce at throw away prices.Moreover, the State Government is yet to fix the minimum support price (MSP) for potato despite tall claims of Potato Mission. To make things worse there is no organised market to ensure fair price to the farmers.Under Potato Mission, besides providing incentivised potato seed, the State Government had also committed to give capital subsidy for new cold storage as per the agricultural policy of 2013. It was also mooting subsidising power tariff for existing and new cold storages till March 31, 2018.Plans were also sketched to maintain buffer stock to deal with short-term scarcity situation and a target has been set to bring 60,000 hectares of land under potato cultivation by 2017-18. But, on the ground the picture is not rosy. This year, the Department of Horticulture had distributed 5350 quintal potato seeds to 29 farmers in Bhatli, Bargarh and Attabira blocks.The seeds were meant to produce 424 quintal of potato. This apart, about 500 quintal of seeds were procured from open market and cultivated by farmers across the district. As the situation stands today, many farmers have resorted to distress sale of potato while many are refusing to harvest it as they want to avoid further losses.Premanand Dang of Jamurda village in Bargarh block had cultivated potato over half an acre of land. But, he has no purchaser and is forced to sell his produce at distress prices.Those who had taken debt for the crop were the first to sell their crop at `3 per kg in absence of any organised market in the district. Similar is the condition of Rajkumar Pradhan of the village, who is not daring to harvest his crop in absence of market. Even if he harvests the crop, the amount he would be getting for the produce would not be enough to recover the harvesting cost.Assistant Horticulture Officer, Sunil Kumar Seth said no communication has been received from the State Government on MSP of potato. There was no cold storage in the district and said if farmers wish they can avail the facility in Sambalpur, he added."

Tomato prices touched a high of Rs 42 a kg at vegetable stores in the city on Tuesday. However, it isnt just tomatoes, but other vegetables too whose prices have begun to climb and are expected to become more expensive when summer sets in.In the case of tomato, prices will have to increase as most of the tomatoes sold are coming from Nagpur, said a vegetable store owner who did not wish to be named. It takes around six days for these tomatoes to reach Chennai as they go to Bengaluru first and then come here. The demand for tomatoes is always high and the supply is getting limited, so prices have to go up.He said he was charging Rs 38 for a kg of tomatoes on Monday but since prices increased by Rs 5 at the Koyambedu vegetable market on Tuesday, he had spiked his rate to Rs 42. He explained that the difference in prices at retail and Koyambedu wholesale market is generally around Rs 4 to Rs 5 less a kg for things like tomatoes and can go up to Rs eight to Rs 10 less in the case of vegetables like beans.Vegetable vendors affirmed that most other vegetables have been hovering around the same prices with minor fluctuation. However, they warned that with the beginning of summer, prices too will go up. They attributed this to different reasons, primary one being the water problem in the State.Water shortage will definitely lead to prices being higher this summer, said S Mani, a vegetable vendor at T. Nagar. Prices of vegetables like ladies finger, especially will keep increasing as it is one of the most commonly bought vegetables in summer.He sold the vegetable at Rs 70 per kg on Tuesday. Prices of onion and potato, however, have remained stable. A kilo of onion can be bought for Rs 18-Rs 20 while a kilo of potato is priced Rs 25."
