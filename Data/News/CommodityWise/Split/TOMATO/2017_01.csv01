Informing about the concept, head of Rourkela-based Sundargarh-II Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), J Pati, said farmers are provided with financial and technical support to take up cultivation.He said to get good returns, farmers would have to plan cultivation in tune with market demands and the market led agriculture extension programme is a feasible option. Many farmers in the district are resorting to off season cultivation of vegetables in protected environment of poly-houses or shed-net structures and are reaping benefits.It is learnt that under National Horticulture Mission, the Horticulture department is offering heavy subsidy to set up poly-house and shed net structures, while KVK is engaged in providing technical knowhow.Deputy Director, Horticulture (DDH) Basudev Sahu said the popularity of poly-house and shed net structures is slowly picking up. Assistant Horticulture Engineer Alok Adhikari said the district has about four poly-houses over 2,500 sq m and nearly 20 shed-net units over 24,000 sq m. Five shed-net units at Kirei cover 8,000-9,000 sq m.These units through organic farming are successfully producing flowers and major vegetables including cauliflower, cabbage, coloured capsicum, cucumber and banana.A poly-house owner SP Jena said he produces about 20 kg of cherry tomato alone. KVKs horticulture scientist Sanjay Pradhan said during off season, poly-houses are successfully growing seedlings in protected environment, but the shed-net units have their own disadvantages during rainy season."

At least 30 different innovations in the sector are stuck, pending approvals from the government.While the retail value of the Indian bio-economy is estimated at $35 billion, projects in the agri-biotech industry have failed to receive an impetus.According to data available with the Association of Biotech Led Industries (ABLE), the retail value of bio agri sector sums up to $9.015 billion, out of which $9 billion is accounted for by commercialisation of Bt cotton alone, with no representation of innovation in any other crops, as licences have not been granted for their field testing.The ABLE Agriculture (Able-Ag) has urged the government to relax policy norms, as companies are finding it hard to get approvals for field testing of their innovations.The Centre had mandated organisations to secure no-objection certificates (NOCs) from the respective state governments and in majority of the cases, approvals were being denied, mostly because of a threat perception about Bt crops, according to members of the association.The government needs to open it up for testing, at the very least. Unless these innovations can be tested for their safety, how can the safety concerns around Bt crops be addressed? asked Shivendra Bajaj, executive director, Able-Ag.The projects awaiting approvals include innovations developed by Indian Institute ofHorticulture Research, Sugarcane Breeding Research Institute, Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture, apart from several private companies with regard to crops such as cotton, maize, mustard, corn, sugarcane, papaya and tomato among others.Giving a glimpse into the situation, he said things were getting worse for the technology year-on-year, for the past five-six years.The irony is that much of the data generated in India is being made of use of by other countries. Countries such as Bangladesh, which entered the field much later, are now making use of Bt innovations in agriculture. Every year, they are slowly increasing the cultivation of Bt brinjal. Pakistan has commercialised Bt maize after testing it for several years. In India, it is still pending even though we started testing it way earlier, Bajaj said.As for the safety concerns, Bajaj said India imported edible oils generated from Bt crops in other countries, while back home there was apprehension about allowing the development of these crops."

He had dug up a borewell to irrigate his 4.4-acre of farm land and had sought more loan to install a pump set. However, the PACS asked him to repay the loan he had already availed, Makaranda added.Suicide by farmers has created an uproar in the Assembly with the Opposition demanding the resignation of Agriculture Minister Pradeep Maharathy over his statement on the death of Khainu Bagarty of Kendapali village in Bargarh district.In Jajpur district, a 27-year-old farmer, Kalinga Ghadei, of Nityanandapur village under Beruda gram panchayat allegedly attempted suicide by consuming poison on Thursday afternoon. Kalinga was first admitted to District Headquarters Hospital at Jajpur town and later shifted to SCB Medical, Cuttack after his condition deteriorated.Ghadeis family members said he had cultivated tomato in 40- decimal land and had taken a loan of `80,000 from locals for the purpose. He was unable to repay the money due to distress sale of his produce.

While he was trying to find out ways to recover the loss, the money lenders had been forcing him for repayment.Unable to bear the humiliation at the hand of money lenders he might have taken the extreme step, said a relative. Khatua, who was only earning member of his seven-member family, is survived by his widow and two minor children - son and daughter, besides his aged parents and younger brother.Collector Pramod Kumar Das said he would personally inquire into the allegations. The body has arrived in his village, Post cremation, I would visit his village and interact with family members on Thursday before submitting the probe report, he said."

58fd123d7be9e06c93714442,Heats up!,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2017/mar/21/heats-up-1584049.html,2017-03-22,"The slight chill of winter from December to February seems to have lulled residents into a comfort zone with cool nights and balmy days. Well, summer is back, with the mercury hitting new highs since the first week of the month and humidity melting us all into a puddle. And March is not even over! It is going to get worse with the massive loss of tree cover in the city, thanks to Vardah that stormed into the city with a vengeance. CE reporters and photographers take a walk through Chennais hot-spots (pun intended) to give you a glimpse of how the city is coping...Juice ItGoing out between 10 am and 5 pm is an indomitable task during summer. While most of us have the luxury of planning our day around the availability of AC rooms and malls, daily wage labourers, and also street vendors toil away in the sun. Those who sell green coconut, fruit juices and freshly cut fruits, provide relief to the commuters and pedestrians, but they themselves have no place to hide from the harsh sun. Fruit juice shops, road-side kamman kuzhu stalls, buttermilk stalls and rickshaws fi lled with green coconut are common in most parts of the city. What better way to beat the heat than to binge drink on these healthy supplements? With `10 a bowl, fruits and juices keep us hydrated and cools down excess body heat.The Beach For Its LoversDuring Chennai veyil, be wary of getting a tan or worse a sun burn! Many youngsters cover their faces with stoles, cotton gloves and dupattas, especially those riding twowheelers. Radiation can cause blisters and rashes on the exposed areas especially the hands, and even dermatologists suggest gloves while riding or even walking in the sun. As we have studied in our primary schools, it is better to wear cotton dresses than nylon or silk, as the latter might stick to the body because of excessive sweating during summer and cause irritation. Talking about suntans, most today have veered towards natural remedies such as rose-water-lime, turmeric-lime and tomato juice-lime. As the temperature increases, the chances of a sun burn are high. Make sure to cool down as quickly as possible. Keep yourself hydrated, and moisturise the area while its damp and consult a doctor for help at the earliest to avoid severe infections.No Bliss, But Blisters!We Chennaiites dont need a weather update to know that summer is fast approaching. Though many of us prefer to stay indoors, its tradition to visit our beaches  from Marina to Bessy and beyond. Well, defi nitely not to show off the summer bod, but to take a refreshing dip, a quick stroll along the warm sand shore and stopping for some mang-kadalai, sugarcane juice and fresh fruits, later! Even at noon, under the hot sun, our beaches seem crowded with people taking shelter under the carts and kattamarams. But as heat-humidity becomes more oppressive, beaches do get deserted with fewer beach lovers and couples.Time To HyderateAnimals and birds in our neighbourhood too need some clean and fresh water. I am sure every summer, we might have seen birds drink the tiny drops of water that leak from taps or dogs and cats drink from street gutters. Why not help these animals cool down a bit? This summer, collect some water in a clean bowl and leave it on your terrace and outside your gate for your feathered and four-legged friends. This might help them quench their thirst from time to time. Dogs and cats are usually on the look-out to rest in cool shady places; make place for them under your car or your garage. If you own a dog or a cat, and decide to take them along with you for some grocery shopping, DO NOT lock them up in the car with the windows open or closed, they may lose their lives because of the heat trapped within. Avoid taking them out for a walk when the heat is at its peak. Give your dog a trim and brush their fur regularly; it helps them stay cool. For your caged pets, like hamsters, birds, and squirrelsleave their cages in a low-sun area. Let all our pawpals, petpals and community animals and birds have a safe and happy summer!"

Among the ones served here, the tomato tartare is a better choice than its chicken counterpart. Double cooked with mozarella and served with black olive powder, the tartare is delicate.The Free-range Chicken had a unique combination of bell peppers and pecorino romano cheese ice cream. The lightly sweet ice cream with a cheese-like taste is a suprising twist because you dont expect your dessert to sit on the appetisers. But it goes well together.Shrimp -- oven baked and roasted -- are served with white spring onion cream and black truffle, they are a must try. The baked shrimp has a strong orange flavour and the roasted is crispy. The cream of white onions lends the dish a sweet and sour flavour.After the Antipasti is served the Primi Piatti, which is essentially pasta. The lemon foam adds a tanginess to the Fagottini pasta served with burrata, lobster and green peas.The parmigiano reggiano (a hard, granular cheese) aged 24 months is a perfect match for the ravioli. It looks fancy but tastes familiar, like it is homemade. The tomatoes add a zing to the morel mushrooms, green peas and asparagus.Secondi Piatti, another mains, has chicken breast and thigh, spinach, wild mushrooms and pumpkin with rosemary, sauce saracena moscato looks exciting but falls flat with the meat cooked in mushroom sauce rubbery.The sea bass tastes fresh. The platter also includes potatoes prepared in saffron sauce. All good here.Finally, the desserts, or as Italians call it Dolci, include Tiramasu Parfait and Citrus Tart, Cream and Nuts. The chef special Tiramasu is highly recommended, with its overpowering coffee flavour. As you dig into the Tiramisu, the cream oozes out. There is a hint of chocolate.As the name suggests, the tart has a strong citrusy flavour from the layers of lemon cream. It is topped with fruits and nuts. The strawberry is a great add-on, softening the otherwise acidic and sharp flavour of lemon.The reviewed dishes were part of the Capri to Calabria, Southern Italian food festival, which closed on March 24. But, few of them will be included in the restaurants main menu in the coming weeks."

The end of line is raking in good moolah for this outlet.Goutom Chatterji, the managing partner, says, Every nine minutes a train arrives, it is like a tsunami has hit the outlet. No one has the time. They just come, order, get their snacks packed and leave to reach office on time. It is a different experience.The outlet opened about two months ago. Sujata Chittiapa, another managing partner says, We studied the station for two months. We observed the crowd that came in. After the connectivity to Mysuru Road, the crowd has increased and it turned out to be better for us.The eatery is open from 9 am to 10.30 pm, until the last train arrives.Goutom claims that the footfall per day is about 1,800 to 2,000. On week days, there are office goers. On weekends, it is usually less as most of them would be families and those who are on joy rides. We earn about Rs 7-9 lakh a month and we pay a rent to BMRCL of about Rs 1.15 lakh, he says.The outlet serves snacks such as vada pav, sandwiches, dahi vada, cakes and hot beverages - tea and coffee.They would soon be including different varieties of tea too.Topped with boondi, their dahi vada is as fresh as it can get. Dipped in a sea of curd, the vada is moist and melts in your mouth as soon as you take a bite.He says, Our specialities are sandwiches, dahi vada, vada pav and cutlets. There are three Mumbaikaars who come here every weekend to have our vada pav. They say this is the closest to the one they get in Mumbai. And it truly does tastes like an authentic Mumbai Vada pav.All items except the bakery confectionaries that includes puff are prepared in batches in their centralised kitchen in C V Raman Nagar, which is just half a kilometre away from the station, he says.Sujata adds, We make food in batches of 30. Once, the items get over. We inform the cooks and within half an hour, a new batch arrives. They are also priced reasonably. The bakery items are outsourced from our friend who owns a bakery.Sujata adds, I am also a dietician. I have always been connected to the food industry. We do not pre-mix sugar in our tea or coffee as there might be some customers who are diabetics too. We provide them sugar separately. Some complain about it while some prefer it.Particular about the hygiene, Goutom challenges, You can walk in to our kitchen anytime without any prior notice and see the hygiene we maintain.If you are a cheese fan, you should definitely try their tomato and cheese sandwich."

Garden enthusiast and the city-based Bharatanatyam exponent Revathi Ramachandran says that having a terrace garden helps in beating the heat, significantly! As we walk through her terrace garden, next to her dance-rehearsal hall, she says, Its wonderful to have a garden so close to the place where you dance. Sometimes my students help me in watering the plants and we even have small fun activities along with rehearsals. And the little ones? They love to eat the mint leaves! she laughs.As we cross the dance hall and open the door to the terrace garden, a gentle fragrance of basil, tulsi, kanakambaram and mint envelops us. Look at those fresh tomatoes! exclaims Revathi. What started as an experiment, gardening became a passion for the danseuse in 2016. It was in early 2016... I had been to an exhibition in Kalakshetra and brought home a gardening kit. It had seed samples of tomatoes and brinjal and thats how I started growing my own veggies, she says. After the first tomato plant flowered, an excited and thrilled Revathi began to grow flowering plants along with fruit-bearing ones. Now she had chilies, capsicum, papaya, ladies finger and avarakai, among others. I use veggies from my garden for cooking and most of the flowers are used to decorate the idols of Gods and Goddesses,she says.With guidance from a neighbour  Sumitra and, Prabhu, who runs a solar nursery in Mandeveli  Revathi set up an elaborate terrace garden. As a child, I remember having a huge garden with big coconut and mango trees, and a big malli poo pandhal. It is difficult to have such sprawling gardens when you are living in apartments, but even a small space is enough to have your own green space and thats the need of the hour! she says, smiling.Revathi grooms her plants every other day and she enjoys doing it. I love spending time here, she says, and adds laughing, But, sometimes it becomes unmanageable.Jasmine, Arali, Mana thakali keerai and Nithyakalayani or myrtle are other plants that adorn her garden. Nithyakaluyani is said to be very good for patients with cancer. All you have to do is boil the petals in water and drink the water and its said to do wonders, she says.She uses 100% organic fertilisers. I dont get time to make my own... I buy them... turmeric water, panchagavya, neem oil and ashes we get after doing a homamare very good for the plants and keeps insects away, she says.With a busy schedule throughout the year, how does she find time for her garden? She shares an incident. I was travelling across the country for a dance performance and, when I came back, the few plants I had had withered. No one had watered them and that was the deciding point for me... I knew I had to spend at least a few hours with them every day. Be it rains, the draining heat or even during the infamous Vardha cyclone, Revathi says she makes sure that she protects her garden. I sit here even if its high noon, she says. The plants keeps the place cool."

The raw bananas are from Shivamogga, capsicums from Mandya, tomato from Kolar, beans from Tumkuru, lemons from Chitradurga.The over 8 million Bengalureans buy close to 5,000 tonnes of vegetable in a day. One can however, take to community farming to avoid buying vegetables from far off land.Popular in the West, Community farming is the way of growing food crops collectively by a group of people, for their own consumption either in a private or public place. In the United States such spaces are known as Victoria gardens.The term market garden and gorilla gardens also means community garden.Community gardening is one of the best ways to grow our own food in the urban area. They help build connections between people, nature and their neighbourhood. In community gardening, a group of people from the same community can do gardening in a common place and share the produce.Use Public SpacesPublic places such as parks, government common areas, school premises and temple garden spaces could be converted into community gardens. The growers can collectively share and work on timings that suit them the best. Some community gardens are maintained by paid gardeners who work in the space all day carrying out regular activities such as watering and weeding.Brings Community TogetherThey sow, harvest and engage in other gardening activities with their family members, and friends. This will be a great entertainment as well as they are contributing to the society by producing their own food.The daily need of greens, vegetables, and some fruits can be easily fulfilled with these gardens. Greens can be grown and harvested in a month.Tomatoes, bhindi, brinjal, beans, chillies, capsicum and gourds such as cucumber, pumpkin, snake gourd can be grown easily in the community gardens. It is very simple to grow the vegetables, without any chemicals and pesticides. Enriched soil is the first step of having a healthy plant.Growing marigold plants, mixed crops of herbs and vegetables, companion plants with pulses will aid in growing healthy plants.Community gardens would be a perfect choice for the city folks to grow more from the available spaces.For more information on urban farming and any related queries, please contact the author at nalini@artyplantz.com."

But we are too familiar with the soaked-in-cheese variant and slightly localised taste. In Italy, the wood-fired bread is served with minimal toppings - garlic, herbs, fresh mozzarella and basil on sparsely smeared tomato sauce. And if are interested to take a bite of the real, authentic pizza, head straight to Slice of Italy, the Italian food festival at Hilton Garden Inn. Though a variety of pizzas are available now, the classic Italian pizza is an uncomplicated preparation of a few delicious ingredients, says the chef.Italy has clear-cut concept of meal structure where the diners indulge in an array of dishes in proper succession rather than sticking to a simple one or two courses. So a typical meal starts with minestrone soup, followed by Patate al forno, Spinachi alla Milanese, Spring green risotto, Beef braciole andChicken marsala. It starts with the antipasto (appetizer), to a first course of pasta or other starches, a main dish of meat or fish with a simple side of vegetables, followed by salad, cheese and fruit, coffee, and possibly a digestive, says the chef.He adds that Italian food is a surprisingly diverse cuisine and each of the twenty Italian regions has a distinctive set of flavours, recipes, products, and ingredients. Across all regions, Italian dishes are straightforward preparations of a few choice ingredients, which are artfully combined. Its basically the climate and geography that defines local cuisine, he says. So the creamy risotto is from the Northern regions, while the south boasts of bright olive oil and tomato-based recipes. They make the best beef steaks in Tuscany, from choice cattle raised in the Chianina Valley. There are unique ingredients like truffle mushrooms, special wines, cured meat (salami), and handcrafted cheese. You will also find a wide regional assortment of breads and pastas. Italian breads differ significantly in size, taste, and texture. There are large, chewy loaves and thin, crunchy sticks, he says.Coffee and desserts are definitely part of the meal as the Italians cherish a soft spot for expresso drinks. Gelato Cookies, cakes, pastries, tarts and a lot others are usually enjoyed with coffee. There are some more exotic others like panettone, a buttery egg-bread laced with dried fruit and candied citrus which takes hours to make. Slice of Italy is on till March 26. Walk in anytime between 7 pm and 11 pm."

Additionally, China has blocked the import of dry fruits and dates from Afghanistan, hitting the trade here badly.Since the beginning of this year, our export of tomatoes, garlic and soya bean to Pakistan has been hit badly. For last two months, the Pakistani authorities did not unload 43 trucks of garlic sent from here. The crop was lying at the Integrated Check Post (ICP) at Attari. Such is the condition of hundreds of trucks of soya bean that were refused by the health authorities of Pakistan citing that these were not fit for consumption, said president Karyana and Dry Fruit Association (Amritsar) Anil Mehra told the New Indian Express.Now they are not allowing tomatoes from here citing the same reason. Tomato prices in Pakistan have gone as high as Rs 150 per kg. The Pakistani authorities have even issued TV advertisements recommending the use of curd instead of tomatoes while cooking, he added.The issue has also affected the 35-year-old trade relation between Afghanistan, from where India imports dry fruits and dry dates regularly. India gets only cement and gypsum from Pakistan and Afghanistan now, Mehra said.If Pakistan does not want to continue trade relations with India due to pressure from its radicals, India should withdraw the status awarded to Pakistan as its most favoured trading partner.The negative sentiment between both the countries is not good for trade. There is a possibility of a decline in the trade relations between the countries in the coming days. Pakistan has already stopped importing perishable goods from us, said Rajdeep Singh Uppal a leading exporter and former chairman of Confederation of Indian Industry (Amritsar Zone).India mainly imports cement, gypsum, dry fruits, rock salt from Pakistan while it exports meat, vegetables, soya meal, raw cotton, yarn to Pakistan."

The video even claims that no tomatoes were used to make tomato ketchup. Ketchup is a popular condiment thats used with everything from French fries to meat loaf.The video explains that tomato ketchup is made from coagulated blood, urine, cocaine, nutmeg and rubbing alcohol. The video conspires that massive quantities of coagulated blood, which is a side product of the meat industry, is brought to the factories that make ketchup.In the next step, the video says that the blood is mixed with a narcotic drug cocaine and urine, where its is supplied directly from the sewer line itself. The video even bears the insignia of Science channel. The creator of the fake video has used the original video of making ketchup and has dubbed a voice-over that changes the description and the name of the ingredients.In reality, tomato ketchup is prepared from red ripe tomatoes, distilled vinegar, high fructose corn syrup, salt, selected spices, onion powder, and natural flavoring."

The price of tomato has dropped due to a glut caused by fewer exports owing to the strike. From Rs 24 per kg, it has now come down to Rs 16 per kg. The prices of onion have remained largely unaffected as traders had large stocks from before the strike.Russell Market Traders Association general secretary Mohammed Idrees Chaudhary said the prices of vegetables and fruits had started witnessing a rise with the onset of summer as the yield is lesser.The ongoing transporters strike has caused a further spike in prices.A resident of Nagarbhavi said the prices of fruits and vegetables had already been on the rise, and have increased further in the past two-three days.

Nithyanandham is still working with the department in Coimbatore.Under the seed subsidy scheme, the State government had given Rs 48 as a subsidy for one kg of tomato seed. Both the officers had created a fake document in the name of Vijayakumar, a farmer-cum-advocate in Pollachi, and forged a signature.The issue came to light after Vijayakumars name was included in the list of beneficiaries at the Coimbatore horticulture department office notice board.On learning about this, Vijayakumar lodged a complaint at the Kinathukkadavu Police Station. It was later transferred to Pollachi East Police Station in 2005. The case was under trial at the Pollachi JM-I court since 2005.

She says, I was very passionate about cooking when I was a kid. I saw lot of bonding happening in the kitchen. That excited me a lot. We were in a joint family. I often found myself once back from school, with the ladies, in the kitchen. It started all there and kept growing more and more in me as a passion.Shazia Khan, first runner up ofMasterChef IndiaBut she never dreamt even in her wildest dreams that she would ever participate in MasterChef and become a chef. It was meant to happen, she says adding, The journey since has been beautiful and very humbling. Theres lot of learning. When you work is your passion, you enjoy it even more. So, I am enjoying my work. I love doing workshops and sharing my knowledge. I also travel quite a bit.A Modern Indian cook, Shazia calls every ingredient unique. Every ingredient is unique in its way. It has something to do with the flavours and textures. As a chef, it is a learning to play with new ingredients and create something new. If there is an ingredient, I find tough to work with, I work more on it and figure out recipes. For example, bitter gourd. Everybody feels it is tough to work with.But as you try, it is actually fun to work to with it.She has made a couple of dishes with bitter gourd, but what is interesting is that bitter gourd can be combined with meat like mutton keema. She says people are usually scared to use it thinking that it will be bitter in taste. But there is a technique. She adds, I learned the technique from my grandmother. You need to soak it in tamarind pulp to remove the whole bitterness and increase the sour agent, that you may find due to tomato or tamarind pulp from the recipe.She created a recipe called stuffed karelas after several trials and errors. She explains, They are small stuffed karela cups. They are stuffed with keema, a morocco style mutton mince. Lot of people loved it. The karela adds whole crunch to the dish. The flavours and spices of morocco cuisine make it taste completely different. It doesnt taste like the usual karelas.The chef Shazia Khan was recently in the city for a cookery workshop at Phoenix Marketcity."

Even as a kid, I was good with home-made recipes and I owe a lot to my mother for that!As a young chef, I also had the opportunity to work in West Asia for a while, and I collaborated with the personal chef of the Prince of Wales during my time in Europe.I also worked with Michelin star chef Vineet Bhatia at the only authentic Indian restaurant in mainland Europe. But I realised that I really wanted to explore modern Indian food and experiment with Indian flavours than cater to western cuisine. Especially, I want Indian food to be recognised globally through the Michelin star reputation, and am attempting that through my own venture, Chefman.Martin LouisI am well-versed in European, Meditteranean, modern Indian cuisine, and homemade recipes. I especially crave for authentic tastes in my food. Precisely for this reason, I always work with my own spices and grind my own powders rather than going for packaged ones  be it piri piri spices, sambar powder or Mexican flavours.I dont use adulterated mixes because working with fresh spices induces the flavours easily. Id rather use fresh tomatoes in cooking than go for processed tomato puree, and make homemade pasta in at least one of my dishes.This is because I strongly believe that authenticity is key to keeping cooking natural.I dont believe fusion food is the right way to put it  in fact a lot of our ingredients with western cooking are very similar. It is just that the cultures and climatic conditions have affected the cooking styles. So yes, while I do attempt to experiment I still keep the authentic taste of the food intact.For example, I have taken an Italian dish called Arancini (stuffed rice balls coated with bread crumbs and fried) and used our very own sambar rice or pongal to make the dish! What Ive done is taken the Italian concept and added Indian flavours to it.As for presentation and plating, making it look presentable is not as important as putting the right ingredients to garnish. You should choose elements that complement the taste of the dish and not just for decorating or to make it look vibrant. Aspiring chefs should also take care to get their basics right as well as learn portion control and hygiene control. After that, you can move on to more detailed things like molecular gastronomy!"

Chief minister Raghubar Das will inaugurate the processing plant, which will process vegetables including green peas, jackfruit, beans, cauliflower, ginger and litchi.Mother Dairy, a subsidiary of National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), markets its vegetable and fruit products under the brand name of Safal, which has been exporting processed food products to 38 countries.The trial run for pea and jackfruit processing, which was started in February this year, has been successful and the plant is ready for commercial production.The plant of second phase, which will extend the processing of tomato, mango, guava, amla and other fruits, is expected to begin functioning from November this year, said officials on Monday.This will be the eastern regions first high-tech integrated automated processing plants along with individual quick freezing and aseptic pulping line facility, said Dilip Rath, chairman of NDDB.Das had laid the foundation stone of Mother Dairys third biggest vegetable and fruit processing plant in February last year.Jharkhand is a vegetable surplus state, producing 38 lakh metric ton vegetables annually against the requirement of 30 lakh metric tonne. The state supplies around one million tonne vegetables to other states, mainly Bihar, Odisha and West Bengal .Due to shortage of buyers, farmers have to dump their surplus produce every year. This year, thousands of farmers dumped tomato and peas at their farm fields, as tomato price dropped to 50 paise kg, while green peas was sold at Rs 2 per kg in wholesale market.Farmers income will grow with operations of the plant, as raw material would be purchased from farmers at fair price. The project will help 50,000 farmers of the state.

Farmers of Bhandra, Kero, Kuru and Senha blocks of Lohardaga district and in Ranchi and other parts of the country Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradeshhave been dumping their tomatoes, onions and French beans.Huge dumps of vegetables were seen along Ranchi-Tata highway (NH-33) near Bhuinyadih vegetable market in Ranchis Tamar block after having been forced to sell their produce at throwaway prices because of bumper crop and cash crunch.The National Institution for Transforming India (Niti) Aayog in a recent paper admitted to the slump in vegetable prices, but attributed it to the bumper crop and not demonetisation of Rs 500/1000 notes.We are in catch-22 situation. Traders are not buying our produce. We neither able to sell the vegetable nor to take it at home, Jaipal Singh Munda, a tomato farmer, said.Jagdish Mahato, a trader at Bhuinyadih wholesale market, said, Tomatoes and French beans are being sold at Rs 1-2 a kg in the market while cauliflower is Rs 5 a piece for last few days.However, the price of tomato is Rs 6-10 a kg, French beans and cauliflower Rs 10 in vegetable markets in Ranchi city.With good monsoon this year, farmers have produced bumper crops in the country.Traders purchasing power has declined after demonetisation. They have restricted their orders. West Bengal traders are not coming to buy vegetables from Jharkhand at this time, said Nakul Mahato, a vegetable grower from Ranchis Pithoria area, who also sells vegetables to West Bengal.State horticulture director Rajiv Kumar said Jharkhand recorded bumper crops this year. So, it is natural the demand will fall. We are trying to increase the demand through advertising significance of tomato on health.He said residents would be requested to buy tomato and store them as ketchup.Next year onwards, vegetable route will also be defined where farmers will be requested to produce different vegetables so that farmers do not see such situation, he said.Jharkhand is a known for surplus vegetable production. According to Jharkhand state horticulture mission (JSHM), the state produces around 38 lakh metric tonne vegetables annually against a requirement of 30 lakh metric tonne. The state exports around one million tonne vegetables to other states every year."
