Their family -- six boys and a girl -- had been eating little for the last three months as money ran out and supplies became harder to get a hold of in the half of the northern Iraqi city that is still under the rule of the Islamic State group.Iraqi forces, after capturing the east in January, have been gearing up for a final assault on the west that officials say could come at any time. In past weeks, people have been slipping out of the western sector, saying a mix of poverty and low food stocks meant that getting food had become a serious problem.People were eating whatever they had, water with bread, or water with tomato paste, said Umm Mohammed. Her kids sometimes went to bed without even that. She and her family made it to eastern Mosul, then to a camp for displaced people outside the city.She spoke on condition she be identified by her traditional honorific because she feared for the safety of relatives still in western Mosul.The United Nations estimates that up to 750,000 civilians may be left in the western half of the city. Aid agencies have no access and all the commercial arteries have been blocked. Since the beginning of the year, around 140 families -- some 600 people -- have made it out of the west to the camps of displaced, according to the UN.The militants have been trying to prevent residents from leaving.Iraqis from Mosul queue for permission to pass through a checkpoint in Bartella. Hundreds of people arrive at the checkpoint every day either fleeing the violence in their home city or to visit their relatives elsewhere in Iraq. (AP)Dafr Mohammed, a 24-year-old farmer from Baddoush, a town on the northern outskirts of the city, said he arranged a boat to cross the Tigris river to the eastern side but was caught by the militants. He was only able to get out because he convinced them his wife was sick and needed a doctor -- and because he left other relatives back in the west, which they took as a guarantee.Most nights we went to bed hungry, including the two kids, said Mohammed.He said the problem wasnt so much the lack of food but that people had no more money to pay for it. Daesh took all the wheat and barley we harvested this year without payment so we didnt have any money, he said, using the Arabic acronym for IS.He survived by doing odd jobs and sometimes getting some money from an uncle who was still receiving his pension. By January, they run out of heating fuel and wood, and started burning their clothes to keep the children warm, he said.Prices in western Mosul have skyrocketed, especially after the road to Syria was blocked late last year, because no more food was coming in, those who escaped said. A 50 kg sack of rice rose to 120,000 dinars ($95), from 19,000 ($15). A sack of flour, once 1,000 dinars ($.80), is now 7,000 ($6).The UNs humanitarian arm said earlier this month that powdered milk for babies had become almost completely unavailable and that a lack of drinking water was also a problem.Abdul-Rahman Aouf Aziz, a 24-year-old who fled in January, said he had got out because he couldnt handle it anymore and was prepared to risk his life in the escape.There was no life left there. It had become very hard, he said."

Initiatives to enhance irrigation network by renovating major reservoir projects, however, will increase yields in a year or two.Agricultural experts of the department, however, claimed that production of major cereals and vegetables this year would be very high as compared to past years.Notwithstanding official claims, the survey report fails to project a cosy picture for the farm sector. Besides dip in production of major fruits like mango, guava, litchi and banana, productivity of major crops like wheat, rice and pulse also witnessed downtrend in 2015-16 as compared to 2013-14.Although production of potato witnessed marginal improvement (63.45 lakh tonne in 2015-16 against 60.50 lakh tonne in 2013-14), onion and tomato went down to 12.47 lakh tonne from 13.04 lakh tonne and 10.01 lakh tonne from 10.61 lakh ton in the same corresponding year.Net sown area for sugarcane also came down to 3.46% of net cultivable area in 2015-16 as against 3.66% recorded in 2013-14.

So, notebandias demonetisation is called colloquiallycouldnt have come at a worse time. With money sucked out of the market, there was a tomato glut, and prices crashed by 80%.A 15-kg crate of tomatoes traded this year between Rs 30 and Rs 50 (instead of Rs 700 at its peak), said Kumar. I had no reason to spend on transportation and bring it to the market or wait for the price to pick up. So, I uprooted all my tomato plants in late November to minimise the loss. This is the worst we have seen in my experience.Kolar is the biggest vegetable-growing region in Karnataka, and houses Asias second-largest tomato market. In November, the ruling price of tomatoes in the Kolar market was Rs 3-5 per kg, or 85% lesser than the same time in 2015.Kumars case is echoed across India. The price of tomatoes crashed to 25 paise/kg, The New Indian Express reported on December 10, 2016, which prompted farmers in a Chhattisgarh district to dump nearly 100 tractor-trolleys, or about 45,000 kg, of tomatoes, on a national highway.Similar incidents by frustrated farmers were reported in Nashik, Hyderabad and other key vegetable-growing regions.Worst hit: Southern tomato farmers, western onion farmersTomato farmers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu were the worst hit since prices fell by 60-85% while onion farmers were the worst hit in Maharashtra and Gujarat, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of vegetable prices in seven Indian citiesAhmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbaibetween November 2015 and November 2016.Source: National Horticulture Board; Negative values indicate rise in pricesThe price of potatoes, which have a shelf life of up to 2-3 months, was stable in places such as Delhi and Chennai, while it rose between 17% and 25% in Bengaluru and Mumbai. The price of potatoes per quintal was Rs 1,086 in November 2015, increasing 27% to Rs 1,376 in November 2016.The price of peas dropped between 15% and 20%, with arrivals increasing in six cities, except Mumbai.The crash in prices was also due to oversupply, the data show. While the prices of tomatoes (hybrid variety) fell by 55-85%, the supply was double and even triple the previous year in parts of India, such as Ahmedabad, Kolkata and Hyderabad, according to data from the National Horticulture Board.In Chennai, for instance, the maximum price a farmer could get per quintal of tomatoes in November 2016 was Rs 760, compared to Rs 4,900 in November 2015, a drop of 85%. The supply to the city was 2,910 metric tonne, an increase of 40% from 2015.In Hyderabad, prices dropped 60% but supply increased 337% in November.Onions were traded anywhere between Rs 650 and Rs 1,500 per quintal in November 2016, compared to Rs 3,027 to Rs 5,600 in 2015.At the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Nashik, Maharashtra, Indias largest wholesale onion market, onions were sold at between Rs 5 and Rs 7 a kilogram.In the seven cities we analysed data for, supply was 196,400 metric tonne in November 2016, against 186,175 metric tonne in November 2015.The situation worsened in December, as prices fell by another 20-50%, and peas traded at a 10-year low in the Delhi market, according to officials from the horticulture department.Enough rains ensured a good harvest but low pricesThe monsoon rains would subside during September to November, and it would result in lesser yield, indicating lesser supply and higher prices, Bellur Krishna, managing director of the state-owned Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society, told IndiaSpend. This year, the rainfall was good in the vegetable-growing regions of Karnataka.This led to good harvest but the prices are also down due to the cash crisis triggered by demonetisation, he said.Kolar, Belagavi, Haveri and Chitradurga, the top vegetable-growing regions in Karnataka, received normal rainfall during the south-west monsoon in 2016.Karnataka declared a drought in 22 districts and some additional talukas in October 2016; the state received Rs 1,782 crore from the central government, IndiaSpend reported on January 10, 2016.The impact of demonetisation could only be to the extent of 20% of the price fall, said Krishna.Demonetisation is expected to hurt agriculture and informal-sector workers, IndiaSpend had reported on November 15, 2016.Around 9.4 million hectares, or 10% of Indias cropped area, is under vegetable cultivation, of which 50% is given to potato, onion and tomato, according to Horticulture Board data.Most of the transactions in fruits and vegetables are in cash, Brajendra Singh, director, National Horticulture Board, told IndiaSpend. So, demonetisation has definitely had some bearing. Arrivals had increased; so, the downturn was obvious.Tomato cultivation is usually routed through market clusters (around cities) and is profitable, Singh said.This time, it was available from local sources, said Singh. The price of tomatoes had gone up to Rs 50 a kg over the last two years. This year, the climate was favourable and resulted in bumper crops. Suddenly, the markets were depressed due to oversupply and because there was no cash.Singh predicted the situation would be normal over the next quarter, and crops would fetch a good price for farmers by the summer of 2017."
58ff29177be9e0429666e21f,Rotten Tomatoes? A Mumbai Start-Up Will Now Keep Them Fresh for over a Month,http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rotten-tomatoes-a-mumbai-start-up-will-now-keep-them-fresh-for-over-a-month/story-hf2ZtZW57cYPXgkNmuZBhL.html,2017-01-11,"Ever had to throw out the last few squishy tomatoes in your veggie crisper because they went bad too soon? Well, a Mumbai start-up may have just hit upon something to save those rotten tomatoes.Science for Society (S4S), a start-up by Matunga-based Institute of Chemical Technology (ICT), has developed a novel packaging technology  ProVegie  that will increase the shelf life of tomatoes by a month.Tomatoes, which are the largest growing commodity globally, including India, usually have a life of five to seven days. The countrys daily consumption of tomatoes is 40,000 tonnes, and post-harvest losses are anywhere between 20% and 40% every year due to poor handling, storage and transportation methods.Developed countries store tomatoes in cold storage that extends their shelf life to 20 days, says Vaibhav Tidke, chief executive officer of S4S. This storage method, however, wont work for Indian farmers since its expensive, and there is no constant electricity supply in villages.A survey of 50 vendors in the city found that unlike onions and potatoes, grocers dont store tomatoes since transportation over large distances damages them, leading to wastage. We want this to change. We want this category of vegetable to move to that of onions and potatoes, so a grocer can also stock them, said Tidke.For the last six months, the S4S team is building a mobile-operated machine that can treat and pack 10,000kg tomatoes per day. It will first treat tomatoes and then package them.ProVegie combines fundamental knowledge of how tomatoes respire and allows this respiration through specially designed packaging to create a self-stable product that will ease storage, transport and logistics, said professor Bhaskar Thorat, who heads the chemical engineering department at ICT, and served as an advisor to S4S.This new packing technology will retain the key nutrients, taste and aroma of tomatoes to serve consumer demands. ProVegie, which will be ready by May this year, is likely to be installed in Nashik, Pune or Aurangabad.According to the model developed by S4S, farmers will sell tomatoes to the start-up and can then take back the processed tomatoes, which can be stored for almost a month and sold in the market. At present, the team is creating a value chain, tying up with grocers, retailers, and companies manufacturing tomato sauces.The S4S team has decided against applying for a patent, instead opting for trade secret intellectual property route. ProVegie is designed to be remotely operated from any place with a mobile phone that will be configured with the SIM card in the machine. This is to ensure that the machine is not opened, said Tidke. So, the operators job will only be to load the tomatoes and see the packaged product."

Her home, however, is not in places such as Jangpura, Hauz Khas Village, Defence Colony, Greater Kailash-II, Malviya Nagar, New Friends Colony or any other similar localities in the city where you would expect a non-diplomat white expat to reside (African expats of Delhi are another story, of course).Instead, designer Elena Tommaseo, a native of Venice in Italy, lives in Lajpat Nagar. Elena is the only white person living in the vicinity, and this warm evening she is to dazzle us with her take on Indo-Italian fusion cuisine.Little did we know that gaining a glimpse into her kitchen would bring us closer to the texture of Delhis multilayered expat life.Elena had originally promised to make bathua risotto  so far we have had this leafy vegetable only at home, stuffed in a parantha or mixed with curd. Our rendezvous begins with a disappointment.Opening the door, she tells us apologetically that she had forgotten that the season of bathua was over. So now, she has decided to make for us her real home-made Italian pasta with real Italian flour.Accordingly, we find Elenas drawing room turned into a makeshift pasta-making factory. She has fixed the gleaming pasta machine on one side of her dining table and alone she is performing the complicated process of rolling out the dough into long narrow pasta strips.On finding herself being photographed, she looks alarmed and says, Oh no! Please dont portray me as some crazy Italian woman who rolls out pasta every night in her home... please mention that I often make simple dal chawal for dinner!It is, after all, Elenas seventh year in the country, long enough for her to develop a taste for Indian khana. At times, she even goes to the extent of ordering dal makhani from Mughal, a nearby restaurant just behind Eros cinema. (Her kitchen rack stands out with one of its takeaway boxes.)Like most Delhiwallas, Elena is hypersensitive about her address  this has been her flat for four years. Its true Im living in Lajpat Nagar but Im more of a Jangpura person... I just dont have the budget for its high rents.Though these two neighbourhoods are next to each other, the green expansive Jangpura feels a continent away from the congested Lajpat Nagar. (Next to Jangpura is the beautiful Nizamuddin East, which is even more vulgar in its rents.)Even so, we find Elenas neighbourhood quite charming. Hers is a park-facing flat. Alas, the park has neither grass nor flowers, and is teeming with a large number of women and children. Its a little too alive, she says. Without any bitter feelings, Elena talks of the long wakeful nights when the neighbourhood hosts devi jagrans and mata ki chowki prayers in the park the whole night long, with the loudspeaker playing devotional bhajans.To be sure, Elena is lucky in having kind neighbours who occasionally invite her for a cup of chai. It is another matter that she is extraordinarily shy of giving them a chance to showcase their hospitality.  Im always asked the same questions during these visits, she says with an amused sigh. Have you married? If I say no, then the next question is  what is your age?Are you married? We ask Elena.She makes a face.Delhis friendly auto-rickshaw drivers also show an active interest in Elenas marital status. By now, she has developed a standard response to quickly kill the curiosity  Yes, Im married. Yes, my husband is a businessman. Yes, I have two children. Yes, one boy, one girl.We follow Elena into her kitchen. She begins the preparations for the pastas tomato sauce by opening a tetra pack of factory-made tomato puree. It tastes better than the Indian tamatar, she says, her voice betraying a hint of contempt as she utters the word tamatar. The Indian tomato tastes too mild, she declares.Picking up a bottle of oil, she says mournfully, I have to use the extra-virgin olive oil from Spain... we Italians are just not good in selling ours abroad.Finally, the meal is ready to be served and Elena arranges the table, complete with forks and knives  not to forget the Indian-made red wine in the wine glass. It is almost feeling like as if we are in Italy. Just then a pressure cooker gives out a shrill whistle from one of the kitchens in the neighbourhood. The aroma of arhar dal wafts through Elenas window. The Italian spell gets broken.But the pasta is truly delicious."

Lakshmi Narayanan and Special ArrangementE_Lakshmi Narayanan;E_Lakshmi NarayananTwo different teams from the Centre inspected the drought-hit areas of Salem district on Tuesday to assess crop loss. One of the teams visited Mettur Dam in the evening and took stock of the storage level.After assessing the drought-situation in Dharmapuri, the team comprising B. Ganesh Ram, Ratna Prasad and Paul Pandian inspected the damaged tomato crops at Marakottai village and cow peas at Aranganur village in Salem.At Mettur Dam, the team collected details of storage level, inflow and discharge from the dam on various occasions for farm activities in the Cauvery delta districts.District Collector V. Sampath made a power point presentation to the team members at the Mettur inspection bungalow on the grim situation and the severity of the drought conditions prevailing in the district for the past many months.The Collector also drew the attention of the Central team to the meagre water storage in the other reservoirs such as Aanaimaduvu, Kariakovil and also in all the major and minor water bodies of the district. C. N. Maheswaran, Commissioner of Social Security Schemes, accompanied the team.The second team comprising Vijay Rajmohan, Director (Trade, Extension and Drought Management), Union Ministry of Agriculture and Santhosh, Assistant Advisor, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, which arrived here after completing the visit of Namakkal, inspected the affected maize fields at Rayanpatti.The team members told presspersons at Veerapandi that they would leave for New Delhi after completing the tour of Tamil Nadu on January 25 and will submit its report to the Centre.This team was accompanied by Dheeraj Kumar, Managing Director, TWAD Board, R. Sukumar, District Revenue Officer, P. Soundararajan, Joint Director of Agriculture, and other officials.In Namakkal district, the team visited three villages and assessed the ground reality and interacted with farmers. Mohammad Nasimuddin, Principal Secretary to Government, Welfare of Differently Abled Persons and District Monitoring Officer and Collector M. Asia Mariam also accompanied it.The team visited a farm at Rasampalayam where 168 coconut trees had withered. The team accessed the dried-up cotton plants in Singalandapuram, withered onion crops and tapioca plants at Bodinaickenpatti.In Krishnagiri, the Central team was told that the district had a rainfall shortage of 30 per cent impacting on 50 per cent of crop productivity of millets and pulses.Collector C.Kathiravan accompanied the team that inspected Bargur, Pochampalli and Uthangarai.The administration told the team that about 1,09,065 hectares was brought under rain-fed cultivation. Of these, a total of 27,452 hectares has been severely hit by drought. Over 50 per cent of the affected area was under millets, groundnuts and the productivity was affected.In turn, this had caused 3,000 tonnes fodder shortage for livestock.The district ought to receive an average 830 mm rainfall. However, it received only around 590 mm.The team inspected fields under pulses and groundnut crop in Bargur block. Interacting with individual farmers in Sivampatty village and Nadupatty village in Bargur, the team sought information on the extent of damage to crops and the overall impact of drought on the fields, that were largely under groundnuts and other pulses crops.The team also visited groundnut, pulses and millets fields at Oilapatty village in Pochampalli and Dasampatty village in Uthangarai.In Erode, dried-up crops and parched fields stared at the Central officials. The team first went to Nochipalayam village and found that mulberry, coconut and sugarcane crops had dried up on vast swathes of fields. The farmers could not save the crops in spite of adoption of drip irrigation and other effective water management practices. The impact was indeed severe, Vijayaraj Mohan, senior official representing the Union Agriculture Ministry said, after observing that a cocoon unit had to be closed down due to non-availability of water.District Collector S. Prabakar pointed out the dry sugarcane stalks to the Central team.At Attayampalayam, the officials took stock of the complete damage to papaya, mango and other crops. Farmers here said they had gone ahead with heavy investments for raising the crops in anticipation of rainfall.Implementation of the Pandiyaru-Punnambazha scheme would be the only long-term solution for preventing recurrence of drought in the district, a farmer said, while narrating the inability of agriculturists to find fodder for their livestock due persistent dry conditions. The team finally visited Samigoundanpalayam village to assess the damage to turmeric crop.On Wednesday, the team will visit Surapalayam and Moolakarai in Erode block to estimate damage to tapioca, turmeric and tomato crops, and Thalayampalayam, Karukkupalayam and Bolanaickenpalayam in Perundurai block to analyse drought impact on groundnut, cotton and maize crops.(Reporting by Syed Muthahar Saqaf in Salem, P.V.

This is resulting in a mismatch with supply far exceeding the demand, says N. Mohan Reddy, a farmer of Kothagadi in Vikarabad district.Crop given upInstances of farmers digging up fields in preparation of new crop without harvesting the standing crop have been reported from the neighbouring Ranga Reddy, Vikarabad and other districts, known for extensive cultivation of vegetables. A visitor to Vikarabad district will come across fields ploughed with remnants of carrot.The cost of 10 kg of carrot plunged to Rs. 30 to Rs. 50 at a time when the production cost is expected to be much higher. The prices showed an upward trend since past couple of days, but the offer price still continues on the lower side. A farmer incurs expenditure to the tune of Rs. 60,000 an acre with expected yield of over 100 quintals of carrot. But, he would end up with losses when selling at Rs. 50 for 10 kg as it would hardly match the investment and he would still have to bear the plucking and transportation charges as overheads.Another reason for the drop in prices is said to be the delay in harvesting of the crop by farmers in anticipation of good returns. This would ultimately inflict damage to at least a portion of the crop and thereby, farmers end up in accumulated losses. The case was no different when the price of tomato dropped steeply in the open market. The current price of tomato ranges from Rs. 250 to Rs. 300 for 25 kg box, but it was traded at less than Rs. 75 per box during the previous season.Private super market chains, bulk buyers of the produce, decide about the procurement price and farmers complain that they would fix the prices without factoring in the input and other costs incurred by them. The Agriculture Marketing Department has deployed officers for bulk sourcing of vegetables from these growers so that it could market the produce on cost-to-cost basis to the consumers.MismatchThe department fixes the prices for each variety of vegetable based largely on the existing market price. But given the mismatch in the demand and supply, prices tend to be on the lower side most of the times, an official engaged in procurement said.Several farmers complain that the absence of support prices to vegetables has become a bane for farmers as the short duration crops are subject to market conditions and there is no guarantee of fixed return on them. The significant rise in labour costs, thanks to the rural employment guarantee programme, had escalated their input cost further, but there has been no support from the Government in the form of announcement of minimum support price for vegetables.There is also no mechanism to enlighten farmers about the likely demand-supply situation and no advisories are coming forth to enable the ryots to take up varieties that were likely to assure at least return of the amounts invested on the crop.Market interventionExperts are of the view that unlike in European countries where Government would intervene in times of glut to avoid crash in prices, there is no mechanism in the country to educate farmers on selection of crops.Moreover, prices are fixed by the consumers, procuring agencies and not producers. There is an urgent need for enhancing extension activities by deploying officials exclusively to educate farmers about the suitability of the crop as also the likely situation when their produce reaches the market, said M. Uma Devi, Director of Water Technology Centre of the Prof. Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University."

They are using the services of tankers to irrigate the farm land.About five persons in Lakhya and Lakshmipura own tankers to supply water for crops.All the lakes, water bodies and borewells in the village have dried up. Gange Halla (Vedavathi river) stopped flowing in the region three decades ago. The groundwater table has declined drastically.The farmers removing pumpsets from the defunct borewells are a common scene at Lakhya village. They are eagerly waiting for tankers that arrive from cities to fetch water to safeguard cattle and crops.A private borewell owner at Kote Layout charges Rs 100 for filling a water tanker. By the time the tanker reaches farm land, the farmers have to shell out Rs 1,200 to Rs 1,300. The farmers have been struggling to save tomato, black pepper, areca nut and coconut.Tanker water supplier Shashidhar said, On an average, I supply water in six trips in a day. Those who have drip irrigation facility and borewells have dried up purchase water from tankers to save their crops.Farmer Ramesh said, I have cultivated tomato on two acres of land. The borewells have dried up. The tomato plants have started flowering. For the survival of plants till monsoon, I spend Rs 2,500 daily for the purchase of water from tankers. I had not dreamt that such a situation will come up in Chikkamagaluru district. Farming and farmers are on the verge of extinction.I have been struggling to purchase seeds and fertilisers. A situation has arisen where we have to seek financial assistance for purchasing water as well, he said.Farmers Sabeer Khan and Sayyed Sadik said, Looking at tomato plants cultivated on three acre land withering, we decided to purchase water to save the plants.L V Basavaraju had cultivated black pepper as a secondary crop with areca nut on a three acres of land. For the survival of pepper vines, he purchases six tankers of water daily.Farmers from Lakhya, Lakshmipura, Kanive and Kuruvangi are mostly cultivating vegetables and supplying to the market. They are self-sufficient with farming and dairy farming. However, with the drought situation prevailing in the region, saving the crops and cattle have become a challenge for the farmers.Environmentalist D V Girish said, River Gowrihalla, which originates in Shola forest of Mullayyanagiri, passes through Dasarahalli, Kanive to reach Lakhya. Later, the water body flows to Ayyanakere, Sakharayapatna, Kadur, Hosadurga and becomes Vedavathi river. The water from the river will be used by the farmers for irrigating the farm land. With the thinning of forest in the hilly range due to forest fire, the sources of river have dried up. As the river is not flowing, the farm land became arid and dry in the region."

Farmers growing tomatoes are a happy lot as a sudden spurt in prices has brought smiles on their faces but the increased rates are burning a hole in the consumers pocket.A month ago tomatoes were being sold for as low as Rs 5 but today they are available for Rs 30 to Rs 40 depending on their size and quality. Nagaraj of HOPCOMS told DH that tomatoes are supplied to the city from Mysuru taluk but for the past one week only 500 kg of tomatoes were arriving at market places every day. The supply was insufficient to meet the demand. He said a decline in supply was contributing to the recent hike in prices.Farmers who had taken up tomato cultivation on a large scale a few months ago had to face huge losses as the prices crashed due to a bumper yield. With the procurement price going below Rs two per kg, farmers were badly affected. A crate (20 kg) of tomatoes was fetching them around Rs 50 but unable to meet the transportation cost, most of the farmers left the fruits to rot in the plant.With the region affected due to severe drought, only a few farmers equipped with pump sets are growing tomatoes and are seeing a good profit with each kilo of tomato (depending on the quality) fetching them approximately Rs 40.TN dependent on stateWith the neighbouring state Tamil Nadu also facing a shortage, tomatoes grown in Karnataka, especially from Chamarajanagar district, are being supplied in large quantities to Erode, Coimbatore, Madurai, Mettupalayam and also to Kerala.Thanks to the demand, traders are camping in the border district to directly purchase tomatoes from farmers who are being paid Rs 20 per kg at their doorsteps. The direct sales have resulted in tomatoes not reaching markets and also effecting a sudden hike in prices. Only 200 crates of tomatoes are being supplied to the market every day in Chamarajanagar district. Some farmers in Gundlupet and Hanur are growing tomatoes extensively to supply to the Kerala market."

The seer, who has been strongly propagating conservation of native cow breeds, was speaking at the Mahamangala of Mangala Gou Yatre organised at Kulur.Asserting that the study of indigenous cattle breeds assumes profound significance, the seer said there should be dedicated universities to study the benefits of cattle products. The cattle has better health benefits that can also get rid of the problems plaguing the country, he said. Karnataka Bank MD and CEO P Jayaram Bhat said the apathy towards traditional agriculture is the result of ignoring cattle-based agrarian activities. Such confernces reinfuse agriculture and spread the significance cattle to the world, he remarked.Dr Sadana from Karnal in Haryana said Panchagavya (prepared using five products of cow - cowdung, urine, milk, curd and ghee) is not just sacred, but also has medicinal value and is rich in proteins. It also helps in keeping nerves and nano particles in the body, he said. Veterinary expert from Bengaluru Dr K P Ramesh said an estimated 40 Desi breeds have survived in the country. Four among them are considered for high yielding milk, 10 with dual benefits and remaining used for laborious works, he added.He said Indian breeds are capable of facing any changes in weather and it is the only reason why most of the scientists across the globe are conducting research into such interest aspects in the cattle, he added.The change in crop pattern, especially by growing tomato in the fields rich with black soil earlier meant for cotton is also a reason for depleting cow breeds. Krishna valley breed is on the verge of extinction due to this reason, he added. Chairman of Agri System Foundation, Coimbatore, Dr E Vadivel said Panchagavya also helps in increasing crop yields. This fact has also been proven in field experiments, he added."

(Source: ANI) AIADMK (Amma) spokesperson C R Saraswathi. (Source: ANI)AIADMK (Amma) spokesperson C R Saraswathi today alleged that she and her supporters were attacked by the rival O Panneerselvam camp while campaigning in the R K Nagar constituency, where bypoll is to be held on April 12. The rival faction, however, has denied the charge. Saraswathi said she was scheduled to address a roadside meeting atop a four-wheeler last evening when members of the rival AIADMK (Puratchi Thalaivi Amma), including former chief minister O Panneerselvam and their candidate E Madhusudhanan, were passing through after canvassing for votes. I switched off the microphone and waited for them to cross but suddenly some of their supporters started abusing us and demanded that our vehicle be removed from the place, she told PTI.We had sought police permission for the meeting, therefore, we remained calm when suddenly some of them started hurling footwear, stones and bottles at us, she said. Three of my supporters sustained injury in the incident, she claimed. However, the Panneerselvam camp denied the allegations and said a footwear and tomato were hurled at her from nearby houses and not from the ground level.Aspire K Swaminathan, Panneerselvam camps Media Coordinator said, The campaign team comprising the former chief minister and Madhusudhanan wanted to take a right turn, so a request was made to the rival camp to make way. She (Saraswathi) suddenly started shouting but Panneerselvam asked us to remain calm. Suddely, a slipper was hurled at her from somewhere even as someone else threw a tomato at her, he said. Denying the role of Panneerselvams supporters in the incident, Swaminathan claimed that the attacks did not emanate from the ground level, but from nearby houses.At no point will our leadership get into such activities. This incident is a manifestation of peoples anger at her leadership, he said. Police said they have not received any complaint on the matter and declined to divulge further details. The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) suffered a vertical split on February 7 after then chief minister Panneerselvam revolted against jailed party chief V K Sasikala, alleging he had been forced to make way for her elevation to the states top post.Later, some MLAs and MPs from AIADMK also switched to his side. Both factions have fielded candidates for the R K Nagar bypoll, necessitated by the demise of sitting MLA and former chief minister J Jayalalithaa. The Election Commission has barred the factions from using the name AIADMK and its two leaves symbol. The Sasikala faction has opted for the name AIADMK (Amma) and has fielded Sasikalas nephew and former MP, T T V Dhinakaran. He is contesting on hat symbol. Madhusudhanan, a party veteran, is seeking votes for electric pole symbol.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
