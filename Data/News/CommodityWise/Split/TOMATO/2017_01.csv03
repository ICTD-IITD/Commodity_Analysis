It is the problem of plenty troubling the Chhota Udepur tomato farmers.It is the problem of plenty troubling the Chhota Udepur tomato farmers. Many tomato farmers have been forced to discard their crops, as there are no takers. And in the wholesale market, the price of one mound or 25 kg tomato has plummeted to Rs 20 which was Rs 500 last year during the same period.Shantilal Tadvi, 52, had hoped that the harvest of his tomato fields located in the Panej village of Bodeli taluka of Chhota Udepur district would bring cheer to the family this year. However, currently, his harvest of plump, heavy tomatoes is packed in 130 cartons, awaiting a pick up to Ankleshwar and southern Gujarat, where he has been traditionally supplying the fruit. Tadvi is expecting to make at least Rs 100 per maund but is unsure if his best quality crop will fetch the price. The ongoing wholesale rates for tomatoes are as low as Rs 20 per maund.Watch what else is making newsTadvi, like many other farmers in the district, is in distress. Last year, he says, the price for the tomatoes was as much as Rs 500 per maund. I have close to 133 maunds of the first round of harvest. The field will be ready for the second round of harvest soon. At the current wholesale price, I do not know how will I be able to sustain my family of six for the coming months.Many farmers in the district have simply discarded their crops for lack of takers. Through the approximately 15-kilometre stretch of the Bodeli-Naswadi road, lush green fields with red, mature tomatoes hanging in neat clusters wear a deserted look  in many cases the cherry red tomatoes fallen around the fields bear a testimony to the disinterest and helplessness with which farmers have abandoned the crops. This stretch has been a tomato belt for three states  Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.Another farmer Virpal Parmar says many farmers have been forced to throw away their crops to grazing cattle. Farmers are giving away tractors full of tomato vines to the grazers as they know that the crop will fetch no price in the wholesale market. Only those tomato growers, who have been able to produce heavy, large sized fruits will stand a chance of their produce being picked up this year as compared to the small, tart varieties. Most families are in deep distress, says Parmar.The sudden decision to demonetise the currency in November has had a cascading effect on the functioning of the APMC markets and the business of wholesalers, who are unwilling to deal in big numbers, says Parmar.A grazier, Valu Dhana, from Jasdan in Rajkot, has arrived in Chhota Udepur with a large cattle herd. Dhana says he has been fetching several kilograms of tomatoes from nearby villages to feed his cattle for the last one week. As the tomato harvest season came to a close, farmers started telling me to take away their discarded yields of ripe tomatoes as they have no value this year. I have brought in several tractors full for the last 10 days and the cattle are feeding on the tomatoes, says Dhana.Tadvi adds that the farmers are forced to do away with the crop as the cost of picking the fruit is costlier than its market value currently. Each labour has to be paid Rs 60 per day for plucking the ripe tomatoes. If the price is lower than Re 1 per kg in the wholesale market, it makes more sense to discard the crop than to waste money on harvesting it, says Tadvi.However, Chhota Udepur APMC Chairman Atul Patel says that the sharp decline in the prices is due to a bumper crop this year, and not demonetisation. There is a bumper crop this year and that is the only reason why the prices have fallen low. The farmers are discarding the crop right now because we do not have facility for cold storage and it is one of those harvests that is extremely perishable. The prices will soon increase as the season ends, Patel said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5904670c7be9e04154df65df,"50-day wait over, where are benefits of demonetisation?",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/priyanka-chaturvedi-blog/50-day-wait-over-where-are-benefits-of-demonetisation/,2017-01-06,"On November 8th last year Prime Minister Modi made the all important demonetisation announcement to the nation. In his subsequent speeches to the people of the country through election rallies and his radio programme, Mann Ki Baat the Prime Minister asked the country to co-operate with him for fifty days after which the results of demonetisation and its impact on black money would be felt. At the end of fifty days the situation in the country is still not anywhere near normal and we still have no answers to the question asked-* Has Demonetisation achieved its purpose, is there a figure to the amount of black money recovered, have terrorism activities shown a fall, have all the counterfeit notes been recovered?* Has the amount of currency in circulation (approximately 86%) that was wiped out in the exercise been replenished and can life be normal again with withdrawal limits on ATM and bank counters removed?* Will the government compensate the farmers who faced losses, daily wage labourers who lost their jobs, families of the 115 dead, the small businesses that faced the brunt of demonetisation?In hope to get answers to these questions the country tuned into PM Modis address on the last day of 2016 sadly what he spoke was on the last day of last year was also a rehash of all his speeches in the past fifty days speaking of the benefits of demonetisation but unable to quantify it even after fifty days of demonetisation. He did announce schemes that were already in place ( Maternity benefits of Rs 6000 being one of them). What is also unfortunate to hear is how the prime minister continues to mislead the people through his election speeches by claiming that demonetisation has ended black money, terrorism and counterfeit notes. Asking him to back it with facts would be near impossible for him to do.The impact and strain on the economy started to show within the fifty days of the announcement, it has managed to paralyze the agricultural economy. Rabi crops have taken a severe hit. Cash crops like tomato and onions have been selling at Re.1/kg and 50 paisa/kg respectively. Modi government put a unilateral embargo on 370 District Central Cooperative Banks and over 93,000 Agricultural Credit Societies, thereby denying agriculture credit to the farmers. Small and Medium industries are shutting down with massive job losses reported in Indias manufacturing hubs such as Tirupur, Faridabad, Ludhiana, Surat and other small and big industrial hubs are also revising their growth estimates. The unorganised sector has been deeply hit too. The unfortunate reality is that the honest cash economy of India, which is the biggest job generator, has been attacked by this unilateral decision of the Modi Government.As the country awaits to hear from the Reserve Bank of India or the government for actual figures of the post-Demonetisation India order the estimates by leading economists including Dr. Manmohan Singh suggest the GDP will decline by 2% or more , RBI has kept it at 0.5%. As per Centre for Monitoring of Indian Economy, loss in first 50 days was an estimated Rs.1,28,000 crore. The Sensex and the Nifty managed to wipe off all the gains made in the year, RBI data released shows bank credit growth at a multi decade low of 5.1%.Composite PMI Output Index fell to47.6 in December, investor sentiment saw an all time low in the past 11 years. There is a near hire freeze in most sectors which could further add to the woes due to demonetisation.The government had initially estimated about 5 lakh crore rupees as black money would be rendered worthless after the demonetisation announcement however those estimates seem to have gone awry with almost 97% of it being deposited in the bank by the end of 31st December. These figures havent yet been declared by the RBI officially. The RBI is also refusing to accept anymore deposits of old currency except from NRIs, which clearly goes against the announcement made earlier on old notes could be deposited at RBI branches after the 31st December deadline was over.The trust deficit in anything the RBI says or the government announces is low with changes being made everyday and no clarity coming from any side. Even after close to two months it seems like it isgoing to be a really long wait for the country to realise, if any, the benefits of demonetisation. However what is most unfortunate is the post truth make believe reality we have been subjected to and the conviction that the countrymen will believe whatever is dished out as a fact by the government."
5904677d7be9e04154df66b7,Leafing through a salad book,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/leafing-through-a-salad-book/,2017-02-13,"On a cold blistery day in Delhi, my nieces 2-year-old son is entertaining himself by looking at pictures in my salad book and identifying the vegetables. About nine thousand miles away in USA, my 22-year-old son has come up trumps after poring over my salad book and zeroing in on the salad for his next meal.The two boys are a generation and many continents apart and yet, this innocuous salad book is their constant tasteful companion, albeit for different reasons. The toddlers mother has bought him a whole slew of baby books featuring fruits and veggies but the little guy invariably picks up my salad book from his moms kitchen and sits down for his daily erudition. My older son, The Health Nut, while living the dolce vida in The Big Apple, is very conscious of his calorie intake like a lot of his generation and hence the salad book is whipped out every now and then.Gone are the days when salads were looked upon as slightly better than a bitter pill to swallow. No one ever tossed a salad for a midday meal or sat in front of the TV with a big bowl of healthy luscious leaves and veggies. And no one thought of salads as comfort foods!The current generation is different. Weaned on a diet of political correctness and nutritional knowledge, they are not comfortable with the ghee-cures-all attitude of the older generations. Salads have made their way into their lexicon along with words like YOLO and hashtag.With the temperature dipping in many parts of the country, when someone mentions comfort food, a lot of young gourmands think beyond steaming hot bowls of soup or mac-&-cheese. While a salad a few years back was not considered comfort food material, times are changing. A big dinner-size salad packed with winter fruits and veggies and delicious toppings can help fuel you through chilly, foggy days. Better still, it can do so without making you feel sluggish and weighed down.With the festive season almost over and done with, February is a time to enjoy the bounty of winter foods and markets filled with colorful winter produce. I love browsing the aisles of the supermarket looking at all the vibrant racks of fresh produce. The brilliance of the malta orange, the plumpness of scarlet strawberries, dewy fresh local berries, and verdant dark greens jostle in a cacophony of color on the grocery shelves. Light summer herbs are replaced by collards, mustard greens, spinach, brussel sprouts and my personal favorite, kale.The chill in winter means that there is a craving for food that is filling. For salad eaters like me, this means changing the typical salad to include hearty grains, bright citrus fruits, nuts, root vegetables and hardy winter greens.So here I am on a Saturday morning at our local supermarket trying to pick out the freshest veggies and fruits for a salad for dinner. On the menu tonight are quiches: a sundried tomato black olive quiche and a bacon quiche. I think a fruity salad would go well with the quiches. The malta oranges call out to me with their flaming bright colors. I pick up some green olives and red onions, a block of spicy pepper gouda cheese and I am all set for my familys favorite Triple-O salad (recipe below).To me, the Triple-O salad is an ideal winter salad. It is light and yet has the depth of flavor with its seasonal notes to stand up to hearty winter dishes. Its simple to make with its three to four ingredients, and can be varied based on your preferences or what you have at home.Just before I wind up my shopping, I pick up a bunch of luscious strawberries and a packet of baby spinach. This along with some pasta and stone-ground bread will make for a lovely lunch tomorrow.Back home, as I am walking in, my son calls in from NYC. Hey mom, I have chicken leftovers. Can you suggest a quick salad? I look at the oranges peeking out of my grocery bag, think about the plummeting temperatures in US and decide its time to have a Triple-O date in two cities. Take down this salad, I say to him crisply, as I start unpacking my groceries.TRIPLE-O SALAD:Ingredients:Green or black Olives: 12  15 (pitted)Red onion: 1 small , sliced into thin ringsOranges: 2 large, cut into  inch slices or sectionsCheese : any pepper or spicy cheese (optional)Dressing:1 tbsp olive oilJuice of 1-2 lemonsSalt and pepper (to taste)Method: Start by peeling the oranges, removing the seeds and cutting into neat slices and set aside. Cut the onion into thin onion rings. A trick I learnt a few years ago was to dunk the onions into boiling water for about 10-15 seconds, removing them and rinsing under cold water. This removes the pungency of the onion. Whisk together the oil, lemon juice and salt and pepper. Place the oranges in a plate, add the olives and red onions, and dribble the dressing on the top. You can add the cheese to the salad from the top or arrange it like I do, around the salad edges."

The most complex and visually striking example from the most sought-after series of the war period, Plant de tomates has been in a private collection for four decades since it was sold at Sothebys New York in 1976. This exquisite museum-quality work is expected to fetch 10,000,000  15,000,000 as part of Sothebys Impressionist & Modern Art Evening sale in London on 1 March 2017.Samuel Valette, Sothebys Senior International Specialist in Impressionist & Modern Art, commented: This exceptional work by Pablo Picasso was painted at a moment of particular tension during the war: the liberation of Paris. As such, it is infused with a sense of renewed energy and hope that distinguishes it from other wartime still-lifes, which were imbued with a more sombre and dark mood. It shows that there was light at the end of the tunnel. For Picasso, the very act of continuing to paint as normal was an act of resistance, and following the Liberation, his atelier became a must-see for the allied soldiers who wanted to witness what the master had created in the war years.In the summer of 1944, Picasso was staying with Marie-Thrse at the Boulevard Henri IV in the weeks before the Liberation of Paris from the Nazis by the Allied Forces. Picasso began to take notice of the potted tomato plant that was growing besides the window of the apartment. These were not uncommon in civilian households throughout Europe at a time when food rations limited the amount of available produce for consumption. Seeing the resilient plant as a sign of hope as it continued to bear fruit, Picasso painted five canvases of the plant on a window sill between August 3 and August 12, 1944  varying in degrees of abstraction. Thus he recorded this consequence of war as a source of admiration and a metaphor of human perseverance in times of strife.In this work, the branches of the plant are weighed down with the heavy tomatoes  their arched shapes standing in contrast with the strong horizontals and verticals of the window, which fragment the composition into a grid-like form. For his palette, Picasso chose vibrant shades of red and green to emphasise the lush and fertile nature of the plant. The background view outside the window is painted with varying shades of yellow and grey, calling to mind the smoke and gunfire that could be heard throughout the city during these frightening last weeks of the war. Rarely has Picasso invested a still-life with such meaning and sociological importance.Although not an active member of the Resistance movement, Picassos artistic activity during the war was deemed as heroic by many of his contemporaries around the world. His art was blacklisted by the Nazi regime and he was not permitted to exhibit his pictures publicly by government decree. However, by this point in his career, Picasso was financially secure and the paintings that he completed during this period remained in his studio  only to be exhibited after the war. A series of photographs that renowned photographer Cecil Beaton took of Picassos studio at rue des Grands-Augustins, several of them showing this work, gives remarkable insight into Picassos work during this period. In the days leading to the Liberation  and in the midst of his painting of the tomato plant series  Picasso met with several British and American journalists and soldiers who wished to praise him for his accomplishment at his studio."

Thought it would have keema in it. Mutton or chicken. Makes sense right, since it is called mince pie. All the upper crust Indians present laughed patronisingly at my display of ignorance and said, really, you didnt know.Nope. No way. Like only the English would make a mince sweet and black pudding a meat dish. We grew up calling custard a pudding or a wobbly jelly with circles of banana embedded in it.I still dont know what is a scallop and it is amazing how some people measure your social worth by your knowledge of these pretentious culinary exercises.Like folks who order Mulligatawny soup like they were making a royal pronouncement from a scroll and you sit there not having the courage to ask what the heck it is, will have tomato soup instead, know that at least. I was well into my thirties when i learnt it was a kind of liquidy dal and the word was a westernised version of mullak thani or colonial country water, like weak rasam. So much for exotic.Since a courgette to me is still a small cucumber i find it tough to be impressed by all this clever labelling.We are at this fancy sit-down do the other day and the hostess says, you must try the ratatouille pure, its my special recipe and everyone oohs and aahs and predictably asks for the recipe with that frenetic fake excitement like they were going to dash off home and cook it right now and she says, the secret is in adding the zucchini to the eggplant with crushed garlic shavings and the finely diced onions sauted in butter.Everyone oohs and aahs, some more like they had found the hiding place of the golden fleece and a lady says one could make it with aubergines, too, i have done that. And i say, tastes like baingan ka bhartha to me, pretty much like my mum used to make, take a brinjal or two, and roast it on the fire till its blackened and then beat it into a pulp Everyone looks away in embarrassment and now i have to recover lost ground like Bruce Willis in a B grade movie so i say, oh, could i have another flattened, leavened circle of Indian bread without the glaze, please."

From customary rituals in the morning to savouring langar and enjoying cultural performances, the revellers are in for a grand treat...Baisakhi celebrations are incomplete without a visit to Gurdwara in the morning. General secretary of Gurdwara Singh Sabha committee, Prakash Singh Jabbal, says, ""Baisakhi is not only the harvest festival for the farmers in Punjab, it also marks the formation of Khalsa Panth for us. After the shabad kirtan in the early morning, around 5000 people participate in Amrit Paan ceremony, which is a very important ritual for all of us.""After prayers, people savour langar, prepared by the volunteers of the community. Jabbal says, ""More than 20,000 people will savour the special Baisakhi feast throughout the day at the Kamptee Road Gurdwara today. To feed so many people, we are using 17 huge sacks of flour, 500 kg daal, 600 kg rice and 20 large woks full of vegetables. We are also serving matar paneer, kulche, chole, doodh jalebi, rajma and tomato chutney. Anyone can come and join us for the langar today and celebrate with us. Also, the youngsters of the community have volunteered to serve this grand feast to people because it promotes the feelings of seva.""On the occasion of Baisakhi, the Jaripatka Sikh community is organising various cultural programmes. One of the organisers of this cultural medley, Amrit Singh Sindhu, shares, ""We are organising the traditional giddha dance today at 11am at Jaripatka community hall, followed by a magnificent performance of gatka  a Sikh martial art technique. These events are important to keep the youngsters connected to our roots and culture.""While community meals, rituals and cultural performances add a festive touch to Baisakhi celebrations, they also provide an opportunity for families to spend time together. Educationist Tanpreet Kaur Tuli says, ""Since Baisakhi is also the beginning of the new year, all of us celebrate this festival together at home. We are making a delicious Punjabi dinner for our family and friends, wherein I will serve dal makhni, rice, naan, paneer and a lot of vegetables. What makes Baisakhi special for us is that all of us spend quality time together and share laughter. Nothing can beat this joy."""

Suddely, a slipper was hurled at her from somewhere even as someone else threw a tomato at her,"" he said.Denying the role of Panneerselvam's supporters in the incident, Swaminathan claimed that the attacks did not emanate ""from the ground level,"" but from nearby houses.""At no point will our leadership get into such activities. This incident is a manifestation of people's anger at her leadership,"" he said.Police said they have not received any complaint on the matter and declined to divulge further details.The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) suffered a vertical split on February 7 after then chief minister Panneerselvam revolted against jailed party chief V K Sasikala, alleging he had been forced to make way for her elevation to the state's top post.Later, some MLAs and MPs from AIADMK also switched to his side.Both factions have fielded candidates for the R K Nagar bypoll, necessitated by the demise of sitting MLA and former chief minister J Jayalalithaa.The Election Commission has barred the factions from using the name AIADMK and its 'two leaves' symbol.The Sasikala faction has opted for the name AIADMK (Amma) and has fielded Sasikala's nephew and former MP, T T V Dhinakaran.

Would you believe if I say it was a mess? (laughs) It started with the spices my parents bought from India. I was helping my sister, who was only a year older than me, to cut vegetables and marinate the meat with tomatoes and that was the fi rst time I smelled cumin and curry powder. I stepped into this fi eld when I was 14. During my summer holidays, I started working at a seafood restaurant to save up for a bike. When I started, I realised it was tough! I learned how to cut the fi sh and clean it before cooking. By the end of the summer, I bought my fi rst bike, and I decided not to give up cooking.Romani AgarwalI joined another restaurant the next summer, and worked with them full-time. For me, cooking is all about fusion. I fuse different cuisines. My one dish called the Tuna Tartar is a fusion of Italian and Asian cuisines. The sesame seeds used in the dish is predominant in Asian cuisines. The sauce is made of mayonnaise mixed with wasabi and horseradish and a little bit of lemon juice. I try to keep my food simple and traditional too at times. Getting to cook a simple traditional dish right is important. A chef should start fusion only when he has enough experience.I have noticed that cooking the simplest food is the most diffi cult. For instance, I have had pasta which was overcooked and smelled like oregano. Few main ingredients I always need in my kitchen are tomato pelati, extra-virgin olive oil (because its lighter), parmesan cheese, and parma ham. Having stayed in India for the past seven to eight years, I started using the herbs that I get here. I prefer using organic vegetables as it gives the food a genuine taste.I remember when we were young we used to steal tomatoes from trees and eat it raw. The taste of the tomatoes is still embedded in my mind that I try to fi nd that smell when I buy tomatoes for my kitchen. Cooking used to be a big task in my family. My mother and grandmother used to get up early in the morning to prepare. Even today, I try to rememeber the taste of their food and remake the dishes from my childhood. I love cooking for my family, but that happens only when I am in Italy. I cook with my brotherin- law who is also a chef. My wife is the queen of the kitchen there (laughs) she says that I make too much mess and wont let me cook."

He wrongly thought that it was a done deal. It's not a done deal.""Le Pen herself joined the bashing, saying ""all French people saw that he had the feeling he'd already won. It's not very respectful of democracy, of the voters"".Reprising her depiction of Macron as a product of the elite, she said he had celebrated with the ""arrogant caste that thinks... it can do anything it wants with the country.""Turbo-chargedSince securing her berth in the runoff, Le Pen has turbo-charged her campaign with a string of appearances and statements, leaving her opponent on the back foot.At the crack of dawn on Tuesday she was at the sprawling Rungis food market outside Paris, taking aim at what she said was Macron's desire for ""total deregulation, total opening up, total free trade"".In contrast, her opponent has huddled in strategy meetings over June legislative elections that will determine the shape of a future Macron government.Polls suggest that Macron will trounce Le Pen in the runoff with a margin of some 20 points.But after the political shocks of Britain's vote to leave the European Union and Donald Trump's unlikely ascent to the White House, analysts say a late surge by Le Pen is still possible.Macron has his work cut out to give people ""positive reasons"" to vote for him, said Guillaume Goubert, editor of the daily La Croix, noting that many voters had chosen him in the first round out of a desire to block other candidates rather than out of any real fervour.Le Pen says she is the only candidate for change in a deeply divided country burdened by high unemployment and inequality.""Nothing in either Mr Macron's policies or his behaviour suggests the slightest proof of his love for France,"" she said on Monday. ""We are going to win.""The candidate had a mixed reception at Rungis, where she drew boos -- and ducked a flying tomato -- over a pledge to deport all illegal immigrants.""We're workers too. We pay our taxes,"" a fruit vendor shouted. ""It's a disgrace,"" another said repeatedly.Also Monday, Le Pen said she was quitting temporarily as head of her National Front (FN) party in order to concentrate on the campaign.The move was seen as largely symbolic but one that would loosen her association with the FN, the party founded by Le Pen's father, Jean-Marie, notorious for anti-Semitic and xenophobic remarks.Homage to slain policemanEarlier Tuesday, the rival candidates attended a sombre ceremony honouring a policeman killed on the Champs-Elysees last week.Macron and Le Pen stood grim-faced among hundreds of mourners as Xavier Jugele's gay partner delivered a moving eulogy to the 37-year-old officer, whose shooting was claimed by the Islamic State group.""I suffer without hatred,"" Etienne Cardiles said at the ceremony led by Hollande at Paris police headquarters.Cardiles was echoing the sentiment of the husband of a victim of the November 2015 jihadist attack on Paris's Bataclan concert hall who said to the perpetrators: ""You won't have my hatred.""Macron and Le Pen differ starkly on how to protect France, still reeling from a string of jihadist attacks since 2015 that has claimed more than 230 lives.Le Pen has called for France to take back control of its borders from the European Union and deport all foreigners on a terror watchlist, accusing Macron of being soft on terrorism.Macron has urged voters not to ""give in to fear"" and vowed to step up security cooperation with EU partners.Analysts say that alongside security, the economy will likely dominate a critical TV debate between the two candidates on May 3."
5922be767be9e01fceefaa9a,"Devotees get cake, burger prasadam",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/607727/devotees-get-cake-burger-prasadam.html,2017-04-22,"Devotees get cake, burger prasadamR Sathyanarayana in Chennai, Apr 22 2017, 23:41 ISTTamil Nadu temple is breaking barriersPrasadam being served to devotees.Temple has installed prasadam vending machinesFamous Venkateswara temple at Tirumala in Andhra Pradesh is known for its laddu prasadam. Similarly, Murgan temple at Palani in Tamil Nadu is famous for its Panchamirtham. Most of the temples across the country serve traditional food as prasadam.However, the traditional prasadams such as laddu, jaggery rice and dhal pongal have become pass at a temple on the outskirts of Chennai. The Jaya Durga Peetam temple at Padappai serves burgers and brownies along with mineral water to devotees. The temple, spread over one acre, is in Oragadam taluk, about 40 km from Chennai.The stylish western type prasadam also includes cakes (without egg), sandwiches, vegetable cutlets, tomato salads and phulkas and they are neatly packed. The temple also offers health drinks, including badam milk.The food is cooked or baked in the temple kitchen, which is certified by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India. The temple also has a well-maintained dining hall. The prasadam, served free of charge, carries manufacturing and best before dates on every packet.The service is also hi-tech. Devotees can collect boxes of prasadam from vending machine installed at the temple's automated kitchen. The prasadam is a big hit not only among locals but also among devotees from different places.One man who has made all these possible is Dr K Sri Sridar, a herbal oncologist. Sridar, who established the temple, says that the worship place was like other temples in the beginning. However, he wanted to make the temple formalities little different not only for offering hygienic prasadam but also for attracting children to worship god.The kumbabishekam for the temple was performed in 1996. At that time it was like any other temple. When I noticed that priests were serving prasadam by hands, I thought it was unhygienic. Then, I decided to change it in my temple, Sridar said.To start with Jaya Durga Peetam temple offered hygienic packed food, including rotis, dal and mixed rice regularly. Later, I thought why not introduce burger and other attractive food items. I elicited the opinions of several people and the response was positive, Sridar said.But, when I started serving cakes and burgers as prasadam, I faced stiff opposition from some temples as they felt my act is against the temple practices as prescribed in the Hindu religion. However, I ignored them and went ahead with my initiative, which attracted several children. The opposition slowly died down, he said.We ensure that prasadam is not repeated in the week. However, burger, cakes, sandwich and brownies are severed only on Saturdays and Sundays so that children and students can come to the temple not only to worship but also for the prasadam, Sridar said.After performing pooja, every devotee will be given a token to get prasadam through the vending machine. Sridar was not satisfied with the introduction of attractive prasadams. He felt that the devotees should get clean drinking water also. I have made sure that every devotee gets 500 ml clean water to quench their thirst after they enter the temple, he said.The temple, which runs through donations, opens at 6 am and closes at 12 noon. In the evenings, darshan will be between 4 pm and 8 pm. Another uniqueness is that the temple has no hundi (cash collection box) on the temple premises. Even the priests will not receive any offerings from the devotees for conducting poojas, Sridar said.He said that by the grace of god they have not faced dearth of people coming to sponsor the day's expenses. On occasions, devotees donate for food and flowers for one week. We will pick the bill if no devotee comes forward to sponsor the day's pooja and prasadam. Daily, about 100 devotees offer pooja at the temple. On special occasions, the figure touches 1,000, Sridar added. However, he declined to disclose the amount donors will have to pay for the daily service.Explaining functioning of the temple, Sridar said, We purchase items required for a particular day and expenses are borne by donors. The payment is directly made to the shop, Sridar said.Not only with prasadam, the temple is slightly hi-tech in welcoming the devotees. Keeping with changed times, the devotees will have to register their names and provide their mobile numbers. They are welcomed by the temple authorities through SMSes. The devotees also get regular alerts on the important poojas and rituals that are to be performed in the temple on auspicious days.The temple's doors are open for celebrating events like birthdays. They are allowed to cut the cake and blow candles. Recently 82-year-old Subbulakshmi, who had never celebrated her birthday, came to the temple with her children and cut a big cake.As a doctor, Sridar says that elderly people, who want to perform ""Angapradhashanam"" (rolling on the floor around the temple) should check their blood pressure before performing it. Besides me, lab technicians will be in the temple to check the BP of old people. If the devotees are not fit, we will not allow them to perform Angapradhashanam, he said.The temple has already banned use of camphor and plastic inside the premises. The management provides hair driers for devotees taking head bath before doing Angapradhashanam.In the next phase of improvement, the temple management is planning smart card system for the devotees to enable them to open the door and enter the temple. Many ATM kiosks have adopted the same."

Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidus vision is to make the State a horticulture hub and increase the net area sown by horticulture crops from the 20% to 35% in the next three years.The benefits of fertigation over the conventional or drop-fertilizing methods include increased nutrient absorption, reduction of fertilizer and water needed and greater control in the application of nutrients.There is a reduction in soil erosion because the nutrients are pumped through the water drip system. Leaching of nutrients from the soil is also decreased.The government is going to promote innovative technologies like off-season, protected cultivation of vegetables and flowers in poly houses and shade net houses, pandal system of vegetable cultivation, using of trellis for tomato cultivation to increase yield and mulching for gourds and melons to increase production and net-returns for farmers.As many as 6.25 lakh farmers micro-irrigating crops are benefiting from various schemes under the A.P. Micro Irrigation Project (APMIP), according to the Planning Department.Net returnAccording to a third party evaluation of the impact of micro irrigation on the net returns to farmers conducted by the NABCONS Consultancy Services and Agriculture Finance Corporation (AFC), there has been a minimum of 25% increase in net income per hectare due to micro-irrigation.Mango showed the highest increase of 50% on net income including the saving on water and energy. The following are the crops and the percentage increase in net return on income due to the impact of micro irrigation: mango 50%, sweet orange 27%, acid lime 25%, guava 25%, banana 42 %, papaya 27%, vegetables 40%, tomato 39%, maize 22% and mulberry 40 %.The State government is implementing strategies to make Rayalaseema as a horticulture hub.The government has set for itself a target of covering 10 lakh farmers in the next three years under the Farmer Producer Organisations (FPO) for agriculture and allied sectors for the formation of linkages to market the States products, globally."

I just caught a glimpse of my face in the mirror. Do I really look like that? Why hasnt anyone called an ambulance yet? My face is tomato red, and my expression screams, At least when the heart attack comes, Ill be allowed to stop moving my legs.Twenty minutes in and theres still no sign of feeling amazing after a Runners High. There is no Runners High. Nonsense. These are the highs that Im aware of: Oh-look-the-treadmills-are-busy-so-now-I-have-an-excuse-to-go-home. Or the beautiful I-think-Ive-earned-French-fries high.What do different settings on the elliptical even mean? It only needs one setting: fit. I would just press that and then I wouldnt have to sit there wasting time trying to decide if cardio or fat burn was going to be more effective at making me feel better about myself.Why is there one Guy That Smells at every gym? I dislike you, Guy That Smells. Someone should talk to him about giving his gym clothes a wash. I mean, Id want to know if I reeked so bad that nobody could stand within three feet of me. Im going to be the one that fixes this, like Dr Phil of the gym. Oh look, hes walking this way. Nevermind abort plan, the stench is too much. Go away, you horrible stinky man!!Its been a week and Im a still mess. One of my problems is that I never know when to give up, which leaves me with more questions and this overwhelming urge to kill the stupid treadmill computer. How do people have extra breath for conversation while Im using all of mine to stay alive? Again, do you have to be a magician or a contortionist to get out of your sports bra? PLEASE write to me if youve figured a way out of this sports bra uniboob situation.Anyway, while the exercise bit might be a little harder to get a handle on, Ive got a few amazing gym beauty hacks up my sleeve. Its all about how you prep your skin for the workout, and not as much as how you clean it afterward. Your usual cleansing routine can take care of a little sweat. Load on the multi vitamins and cleanse with a wet wipe before exercising. (Im all about the Sephora towelettes) Target serums not moisturisers. Cold water after the workout and non-greasy mineral-based products only please!This is the key: blow dry after the showers, steam rooms and saunas. Your hair will dry quicker and be less frizzy! I have a hair product cocktail ready in case Im going out after the gym. Its dry shampoo, texture spray and an argan oil infused hair oil. This cleans, masks smells and gives it just enough volume for me to pretend that I didnt just die a hundred deaths a few hours earlier. Trust me, if Ive learned anything from Khloe Kardashian, it is that you can leave the gym looking fresh. Have a happy (less miserable) workout!(The writers interest include oversharing, wine and period dramas)"
