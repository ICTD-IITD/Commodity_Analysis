Jaganmohan Reddy, scheduled for two days from April 26 in Guntur, has been postponed to May 1 and 2.Senior party leader Botcha Satyanarayana told the media in Hyderabad on Friday that though Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu announced the setting up of a market stabilising fund of Rs. 5,000 crore nothing had materialised till date.He said the party was committed to the welfare of the farmers. Chilli, turmeric, mango, and tomato farmers were not getting remunerative prices and therefore resorting to distress sale, he said.TDP gagging social mediaAnother senior party Bhumana Karunakar Reddy charged Mr. Naidu and his son and Information and Technology Minister N. Lokesh with becoming intolerant to criticism.He alleged that they were behaving like dictators and trying to gag the social media. It was the very same social media that helped Mr. Naidu spread canards against YSR Congress president Y.S.

His village of Kannamoochi lies a few kilometres from Mettur Dams reservoir. This is where Cauvery comes to after a run across the plains of Dharmapuri district. Coursing along the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border, it tumbles over Hogenakkal Falls and is captured by Stanley Reservoir in Salem district.It used to be a majestic reservoir, created in 1934 during the construction of Mettur Dam, now the subject of more litigation than irrigation. Now its a memory for most of the year.Seven of Thavasi Rajs nine borewells are dry. Whose arent in this summer of discontent? But this is the flood plain of Cauvery, and the depth of his two functional borewells indicate how deep the river has sank. One is 1,100ft and the other 900ft, reports Thavasi. The speed of water from the second one has gone down, and Im scared itll stop working soon.Thavasi is lucky to have any water at all. Smaller farmers cant afford to burrow so deep. Im just lucky because there is still some ground water left in Kannamoochi, he says.Salem is big on horticulture. Orchards occupy roughly 25 percent of all cultivable land: chillies, turmeric, plantain, tapioca, areca nut, tomatoes and other vegetables. The famous Salem mangoes are grown in Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri.This year, inflorescence was promising in January, but never came. Now farmer R Venkatachalam of Vanavasi village is showing us the fruit of his labour. Its a tiny Kiimooku that fits into the pit of his palm. Kiimookus grow to 300gm, but this one is 100gm.Venkatachalam and his brother Raju R struggled all spring to irrigate the 600 trees they have in their 10-acre orchard. They bought dozens of 5,000-litre tankerloads, each for Rs 600-700. But the deliveries were never prompt. Other farmers needed water too.In the village, another farmer, P Kasigounder, reels off his losses: 25 percent in 2015, 50 percent in 2016 and 85 percent this summer. I lost Rs 3 lakh, says Kasigounder. The kind government offered Rs 5,900 as drought relief.Further off from the Mettur Dam, we stop at the field of Selvaraj R in Kolathur. Its barely 8km from Stanley, but his chilli field is cinder-dry with his cattle scrounging for tufts of grass. A chilli field beyond him has been baked bronze. Selvaraj plucks a pepper and holds it up by the stalk like a scientist would a lab rat. How will anybody buy this! he sighs.Kolathur chillis are known for their kick on the palate. They are the flavourful condiment vathal milagai you get with South Indian food. The local trick is to allow the chillies to ripen and dry in the field and take them straight to the shandy (market). This year, the pods didnt stand a chance.The Kolathur chilli crop yields five or six harvests in 15-day intervals during the February-May period. This year, farmers lost 80-90 percent of it. The crop withered even before the first harvest.The February-March period was a desperate time in horticulture villages like Thalaivasal. One farmer, P Kalayarasan, said he struggled to keep his crop alive as his only borewell began to die. We spent Rs 25,000 to save our chilli field. It was of no use, he said. Now we dont have water for cattle.Some five per cent of the crop made it to the market in the Thalaivasal block this year. With time on his hands, Kalayarasan remembers the good times: During peak seasons, we used to bring chillies to the shandy in 10-15 bicycles and sold it at Rs 150 per kg. It wasnt only short-duration crops like chilli that didnt survive. Coconut and areca nut groves gave horticulturists as much grief.Areca begins yielding in three years and lives up to 35. But 65 percent of the trees died in Salem district this year. Farmer Pandian P said that 2015 hadnt been a good year either, but his two borewells saved him. In 2017, both gave up.How some beat the droughtDrip, drip, dripAmidst the vast expanse of dry fields in Kannampoochi village, one tiny field of plantain, belonging to farmer Thavasi, looked like it had a tinge of green. At the foot of the boles, a black pipe snakes along the ridges on which the plantain saplings grow. Drip irrigation trickled into Salem about a decade ago and it is gaining popularity given that drought has blighted the region.This year, Thavasi has made a profit because, although banana production fell due to drought, the drip saved his crop. If a well irrigates one acre of land, a drip takes care of two-three acres, he says. I dont think I would have had a crop without it.The districts horticulture department offers a total subsidy to small farmers (those owning less than 5 acres) and a 75 per cent subsidy to big farmers. However, drip irrigations popularity is restricted to plantains and tapioca. It has not spread to other crops.Plastic mulchAnother new technique used by vegetable and tapioca farmers is plastic mulch  a long sheet of plastic with several circular holes in it. Several acres of vegetables are grown in these holes. These mulches reduce evaporation, control growth of weed and can be re-used for a second harvest, a horticulture official says. Between 2014 and 2016 over 100 hectares of land were mulched in Salem. This technique is applied alongside drip irrigation.Pitcher irrigationPitcher irrigation is another strategy implemented in some parts of the district. An earthen pot with a lid on top and holes at the bottom is buried in the soil. Crops, particularly vegetables, are sown around the pitcher. This ensures water does not evaporate and reaches only the roots. But the technique is less popular than mulching.Go tapiocaTapioca is used for making sago and starch. Salem contributes to about one-third of all sago produced in India. Although tapioca is drought-resistant, its cultivation has gone down by half, according to the horticulture department. If tapioca gets affected by a drought, chances are that the situation is very severe, a senior official said."

Beans, broccoli, blueberries, salmon, spinach, tomatoes, kale, walnuts and yogurt are some of the chief ingredients that make up most of the dishes.The diner has definietly stepped up the game in terms of healthy food and has gone beyond the regular salad to please the fitness concious and the foodies alike. The menu features appetizers, entrees, sides and desserts. We started off with the Fruits and Nuts Super Salad. The salad offers the crispness of te romaine lettuce, spinach, red cabbage and broccoli along with the crunch and sweetness of the walnuts, apples, dried apricots, cranberries and blueberries. While, I have always been skeptical of salads, this one definitely made me rethink.I would any day prefer binging on this good looking salad that tastes beautiful with the crisp and crunch of green and nuts, seasoned with a pomegranate honey mustard vinaigrette.Try the Pomegranate Honey Mustard Salmon. The lemon and olive oil basted grilled salmon filet is grilled just right with a crisp top and a very well cooked meat inside. The fish is topped with pomegranate honey mustard vinaigrette. The dish is mildly sweet, served with couscous and ginner kale along with with toasted almond, cranberry and blueberry.This one will win your heart with the saltiness of the fish and the sweetness of the dressing. The Cherry Chipotle BBQ Chicken too is cooked very well. The grilled chicked breast is flavoured with lemon and olive oil and is topped with tangy cherry chipotle BBQ sauce. It is served with an apple five-grain pilaf and fresh broccoli slaw.If you are a vegetarian, dealing with an itchy throat or just having a bad day in general, ask for the Vegetarian Tex Mex Chili, like I did. The dish just fills you up with warmness and the tanginess of the sun-ripened tomatoes along with the substance of the beans.Like the name suggests, this is truly a Tex Mex wholesome meal made with chipotle peppers, red onions topped with yogurt, fresh pico de galloand jalapeno. The dish is served hot and spicy on a brown rice pilaf. We ended our meal with the Fruit Crumble dessert. Do I love sweet and sour blended in with loads of crunchy crumble? Hell yeah! The dessert is heavy on the sour side, but I have always enjoyed citrus flavours, so I had a gala time devouring this delicious baby.While scaling high on the flavours, the dessert will also appeal to those watching their calories. The crumble is packed with strawberries, blackberries, blueberries and juicy peaches and served hot with a topping of vanilla frozen yogurt scoop.I would highly recommend foodies and the health concious to go check out this new menu.Cost for two: `2,500 (approx)"

And with two other areas outside, one that is bustling with DJs chartbusters and another quieter space outdoors, where you can enjoy the meal along with the beautiful Bengaluru weather.Their new menu is born out of sustainable living practices. It includes sustainable food that is made out of locally sourced ingredients. They use deep sea fish and their chicken is claimed to be antibiotic and artificial hormone free. While today several restaurants in the city boasts of offering healthy food on their menu, Fava claims to be one of the very few that aims for ethical food.The Polenta Crusted Crispy Goat Cheese and Thyme Roll is crunchy on the outside and its insides melt as soon as you take a bite. It is served with a spiced tomato relish. The Plated Smoked Salmon Labneh is cooked very well and has subtle flavours of capers, dill and paprika ruling the palate. The Grilled Deep Sea Prawn with Black Sesame too is cooked right and has the smoky flavour of the prawn that blends well with chilli, garlic and extra virgin olive oil seasoning. In the Plated Mezze and Salad category, I absolutely fell in love with Father Michaels Valombrossa Burrata.If there was one word I could use to describe it, then it would be beautiful. The dish is a maple tree farm organic beetroot mezze with dukkah and popped amaranth. The Melon, Watermelon & Feta Salad is what you call basic done right. The dish is simple and lets the fruits and the feta take a centrestage with its natural flavours, which by the way are absolutely fresh tasting. The dish is tempered with pomegranate, mint, arugula, balsamic reduction and extra virgin olive oil. Among pizzas, I tried the multi grain vegetarian Funghi Misti pizza. It tastes fresh out of the oven with toppings of corn, jalapeno, bell pepper, onion and mozzarella.In the main course, I would highly recommend the Mediterranean Style Stir-fry with Millet & Black Rice Risotto. The dish is warm, tastes fresh and healthy thanks to the locally sourced grains that take the stage to recreate an Italian Classic with organic vegetables. Among the non vegetarian dishes, the Signature Pomegranate Chicken is a must have. The chicken is very well cooked with the subtle pomegranate flavour. It is served with chargrilled vegetables and parsley-arugula vichyssoise. At Fava, the kitchen uses Earth Loaf chocolates made from Indian cacao beans. The chocolates are made in Mysuru.If you are in the mood to experiment, try Favas homemade liquid nitrogen infused 100% natural ice cream, sorbet and frozen yoghurt with topping. I had it in caramel popcorn. The ice cream is super smooth and has a strong caramel flavour. It was topped with a few caramel popcorn. My favourite, however, is the Duet of Chocolate Fondant . It has the chocolate crunch, with a gooey foundant that oozes when you dip in your spoon. It is a play on hot and cold chocolate flavours. Do give this one a try.Among cocktails, I tried the liquid nitrogen infused house special Cocktails including Fava Martini, Pink Bramble and Morgan Colada. I particularly enjoyed the Fava Martini that had a good punch of gin that blends well with cranberry juice, gingerm blue curacao, grenadine and fresh lime.Morgan Colada too was an interesting combination, especially for Captain Morgan rum fans. This cocktail has spiced rum mixed with pineapple juice and coconut milk. Other than these, the Tiramisu cocktail too was an interesting spin on the dessert. It has tequila, Baileys mascarpone and espresso. Id say if you are ending your meall with a drink, let it be Tiramisu.Cost for two: `1,900 (approx.)"

She is in her early 60s and her family has been doing the laundry for 15 families for generations. As is the tradition for rural dhobis, she is paid at wedding time in cash and new clothes. Or she is paid in paddy every year, 50 seru (one seru is a little over a kg) per person in her household.Hulligeammas life depends on water. She makes a living from it and gets paid in produce that needs it. So the current drought has hit her harder and Hulligeamma is crying hoarse about it.Rajoli is a village in the drought-prone district of Raichur (rainfall less than 650 mm) in Karnataka. It has seen six consecutive seasons of deficient rainfall. In the past monsoon year, two cycles of rain (the southwest monsoon from June to September and the northeast from October to December) were short by 15 per cent and 71 per cent respectively in Karnataka.Farmers in Rajoli suffered losses on their cotton crop last season with high temperatures causing a pink bollworm attack, and switched to red chilli. But too many people planted chilli and prices crashed this year.It was a bitter harvest. Standing chilli crops have been burnt to avoid the reaping expenses. Many fields are dotted with abandoned heaps of chilli, like hot blisters.With little money to go around and barely enough water, tempers are short and generosity scarce.All of Rajolis drinking water sources have dried up and its people have to go to a tap in Irapuram village, 3 km away. Hulligeamma says, You will have to go without drinking water if you dont have a two-wheeler.The gram panchayat has tried to ease the villagers hardship by renting a tap from a farmer for Rs 8,000 a month but it rarely serves all the families.There are 11 people in Hulligeammas family: three sons, three daughters-in-law, three grandchildren, Hulligeamma and her paralysed husband. Her youngest son brings drinking water, four pots every two days, for the entire family on a borrowed motorcycle.He gets up at 6 am and spends an hour at the tap, she says. Often there are people from Irapuram too. Then he has to wait till they are done, which means he has to spend nearly two hours at the tap.If the boy falls ill, then the family simply has to make do with what is left because none of the others knows how to ride a two-wheeler. Should that happen, the good water is reserved for the older people and the younger ones drink salt water. Salt water gives us diarrhea, Hulligeamma explains. At least the young people have the health to withstand it.Sometimes, she begs the neighbours to fetch her a pot too. They can be insulting, she says. They dont have enough to be generous.The dhobi community of Rajoli live along a three feet wide canal. Theres a tap that gives salt water for a few hours in the evening and each family might get five to eight pots on a good day. If the children have any play time after school, they are handed water pots to go look for a tap.Food is cooked in salt water so the dal ends up rare. We have to pour oil and even then it is only half cooked, says Hulligeammas daughter-in-law. Better-off neighbours with fewer mouths to feed, like Yeramma Iraimatti, have switched to vegetables like ladies finger and tomatoes. Yeramma is also one of the rare few who orders water cans from a store.Last week there was a wedding in the wealthier part of the Rajoli. Barely in their twenties, Nagesh and Saraswati wed in the presence of over 500 guests and nearly a hundred stayed over in the neem-shaded house. The young groom says, We had to hire tankers for the water: Rs 500 for the tanker and Rs 800 for a tractor to pull it... I drove it myself. We need two such tankers a day. I wish I hadnt married.Hulligeamma has been called in to do the laundry. Normally my daughters-in-law and I would take the clothes to the canal nearby, she says, but that has dried up. Her regular customers send her a lesser load once a week. Earlier the upper-caste households used to send a bundle twice a week.There is the water stored in a drum (500 litres). We may need four of that for the wedding, but I'll make do with one.But how? Hulligeamma breaks into a wide smile."
5922d03b7be9e01fc7f5a0e0,Drought no deterrent for drip irrigated vegetable crops in Coimbatore,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/drought-no-deterrent-for-drip-irrigated-veg-crops-in-coimbatore/articleshow/58406926.cms,2017-04-28,,The Times Of India,"Thanks to drip irrigation , the drought in the state seems to have barely affected the horticulture farmers in Coimbatore district. While horticulture cultivation in the district has come down only by 6% this year, statistics with the horticulture department show that vegetable cultivation has gone up by 600 hectares or around 9%, due to increase in cultivation of onion.Data shows that almost 50% of the land in the district under fruits, spices, vegetables and flower cultivation is drip irrigated. In 2016-2017, 36,539 hectares of horticulture crops were cultivated in the district against cultivation on 39,000 hectares in the previous financial year. ""While the acreage under fruits, spices and flowers has come down in the district, the area under vegetable cultivation has actually increased by 600 hectares. So acreage wise, we do not see much of a difference from the previous year yet,"" said the deputy director of horticulture, A Ramakrishnan. ""But the cultivation this year has witnessed a noticeable drop when compared to that in 2014-2015 - when we had good rains,"" he said.While acreage under crops like banana, turmeric and tomato has fallen by 200 hectares to 300 hectares, area under onions has gone up. ""Banana and turmeric are long-term crops that require more water and so does tomato to give a good yield. Thus, many farmers have turned to vegetables like onions, chillies and lady's finger which are less fleshy and require less water,"" said Ramakrishnan.The area under plantation crops too has increased by 1,000 hectares, mainly because cocoa inter-crop plantations were also taken into account. Officials attribute the farmers' confidence to cultivate even in the face of such a severe drought, to drip irrigation. ""In the district, only farmers with assured water and irrigation facilities bother cultivating their land. They stopped completely relying on rainfall many years ago,"" said Vasanthi Gnanasekharan, assistant director of horticulture department, Thondamuthur block.""In our district, if you remove the 15,000 hectares of plantation crops like tea, coffee, banana and cocoa from the equation, at least 50% of the remaining 21,000 hectares of cultivable land are drip irrigated,"" said Ramakrishnan. ""Drip irrigation becomes critical during drought situations, because with one large tank of water, we can add the required fertilizer and water almost five acres for four days,"" said A Veeramani, a chilly farmer in Madukkarai . ""In normal situations, the water stock would get over in a day or two, and will not cover the entire five acres,"" he said.The horticulture department now targets getting the entire area under fruit, vegetable and spice cultivation in the district under drip irrigation within the next five years. ""We hope to achieve our targets within three years or maximum five years,"" said Ramakrishnan. ""The government's subsidies of 75% to 100% for the programme also play a major role in achieving our target,"" he said."

While growers are helplessly watching crops wilting, skyrocketing prices are making vegetables unaffordable for most Bengalureans.The worst hit vegetables are tomatoes, gourds, beans and ladys finger, apart from coconuts. The inflow of vegetables such as raddish, carrot, brinjal and cauliflower has fallen steeply, according to M. Muniraju, marketing supervisor, Kolar Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee. There is simply no water, he said.Steep fall in tomato prices during September-December has led to fewer farmers sowing tomatoes in Kolar, but even this crop is hit by drought. There is a large scale loss of tomatoes and the crop harvested this time is not of great quality. I have lost everything this season, said Adireddy, a farmer from Chintamani.A senior procurement official from a leading retail chain in the city said the arrival of quality tomatoes was down to a trickle leading to a surge in prices. A kg of tomato is being sold between Rs. 26 and Rs. 30 in the city.Gourds affected tooThe entire range of gourds, the main crop grown in Devanahalli-Chickballapur belt, has taken a severe beating too.The average price of these gourds in the city retail markets is at an all-time high of about Rs. 60 to Rs. 65 per kg. There is a severe shortage for even drinking water, and its no wonder agriculture has taken a back seat. Most of the tubewells have dried up rendering horticulture paralysed. We are buying drinking water, lamented G. Muniswamy Gowda, a farmer from Devanahalli.Irregular power supply has only worsened the situation. V. Jagadeesha, a farmer from Hoskote, said power is supplied for about three hours during night, which is often intermittent. Only those who have got drip irrigation facility in their farms are saved from the ordeal. Even though you have water in the tubewells, it cannot be drawn without power supply, he said.Vegetable prices are traditionally low during December-March period, as it is the season of avarekai (field beans). However, this season, the arrival of avarekai in the city has come down to a meagre 20% to 30% of the usual. A kg of avarekai is still trading as high as Rs. 40, while by this time it should have been less than Rs. 15.Unless there is rain in March, expected during Ugadi festival, the price of vegetables are only expected to skyrocket, making them scarce in the city and pushing farmers into further distress, said senior officials of HOPCOMs.There is a large-scale loss of tomatoes and the crop harvested this time is not of great quality.

While outlandish, futuristic ideas used to rule the roost in this genre, recent times have brought on-screen scenarios that are no longer completely fictional. With modern scientific advances, technology has become a nearly limitless player in our lives. Resultantly, Artificial Intelligence, cloning and robots have now begun to feature in movies and TV shows almost as notably as actual humans...The much-hyped sequel for Rajnikanth 's Enthiran is slated for release in early 2018, in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi. Although the story is as yet unknown, there is no doubt that the famed Chitti robot from the first movie will play a similarly significant role in 2.0, establishing machines as possible protagonists on Indian screens as well.This anthology television show wowed viewers with its ability to present a satirical yet honest take on contemporary society and its digital advancements, acting as a dark-humoured 'mirror' of the modern world. However, with episodes like Be Right Back and White Christmas, this series upped the ante. Telling haunting tales of extracted, 'cookie' consciousness and clones created to replace the dead, Black Mirror aptly reflects human obsession with virtual realities.Ex Machina is another sci-fi movie that explores the relationship between actual human beings and artificially intelligent bots. Although told mostly through the lens of Caleb (a programmer who is tasked with assessing an android's human qualities), the title and the ending of this movie lead audiences to believe that the story was more about the AI computer (Ava) herself, hinting that technology is playing a bigger role in our lives than previously anticipated.Adapted from two previous movies released in 1973 and 1976, this science-fiction thriller gives audiences a glimpse into an alarming alternative reality where every human desire can be indulged, with no consequences. Set in a Western-themed amusement park inhabited by compliant automatons, Westworld explores a futuristic world where technology paves the way for complete human gratification.Deemed a dystopian fantasy-thriller, Transcendence stunned audiences with its unique plot-line, where the protagonist loses his physical body only to have his consciousness uploaded on to a quantum computer. Elements of drama and romance raise the movie's appeal, but the anti-technology activists shown in it are what make it particularly memorable. Transcendence presents a frightening picture of the possible repercussions of technology being allowed to run rampant.Revolving around the story of an introverted and lonely letter writer, Her was an unconventional movie that broke all precedented norms about human-AI relations. Although set in a futuristic world, the story of Theodore Twombly falling in love with an artifically intelligent operating system is startlingly possible in real life (seeing how the movie was inspired byexisting technology), making Theodore's tale so much more touching.Although scientific advancement does not play a pivotal role in them, here are a few movies whose stories would not move forward if not for the technology in their plots:A laugh-riot, Why Him? is an American movie that follows the story of a protective father meeting his daughter's ludicrous boyfriend, Laird. Although the actors effortlessly carry the movie on their shoulders, the hilarity added by Laird's AI house control system goes a long way in making this a definite comedy.Though it was released over a decade ago, The Prestige has continued to remain a beloved classic because of its stirring account of a bitter battle between two fellow magicians. The stunning revelation at the end  of Nikola Tesla 's machine and its cloning capabilities  only add to the film's aura and charm.- Sanjana Sindhe"

Now, he is posting a high yield from his vegetable cultivation and is making good money from his 100 cents of land.Vanmeega Venkataachalam, who was a professor at a private college in Mayiladuthurai for the past 30 years, decided to be an organic farmer post retirement. Even as he has a good bank balance, leads a sophisticated life and his children earn high in foreign countries, Venkatachalam took the call to be a farmer for the rest of his life and chose the 100 cents of land in Aandaancherry Village, Tharangambadi block for his dream.Following a fully organic method of cultivation, right from preparing soil using goat dung, earth worms and cow dung, through planting the seeds and fertigation, he has got the best results.Speaking to Express, Venkatachalam said, Though I had an option to rest after retirement, I chose to live in my ancestors village and do organic farming. Earlier, I used to finance all the agricultural practices on my land, though not organic and was not involved myself.I have not done organic farming myself earlier and thought I would give it a try now, as I have enough time. On a probation basis, I chose just 1 acre of the two-acre land in January and first replaced the soil as it was laden with chemical fertilizers and started the ploughing works. Then seven loads of cow dung added to the soil and the seeds were sown. For brinjal, tomato, ladies finger and a few other greens, saplings were planted.Referring to the organic fertilizer used, he said, After buying 5 kg of Panchakavya, mixed it with cow dung, fish wastes, earthworms, buttermilk, sugar cane juice and water. After one week of fermentation, 300 ml of this mixture was diluted with 12 litres of water and sprayed in the farm land once a week from the time of sowing and till now.Venkatachalam further said that he has used garlic ginger mixture as an organic pesticide which prevents the entry of insects into his farm. With this, he is getting at least 300 to 400 kg of vegetables per week, while using the chemical fertilizer he just got 200 kgs last year.Last year, I had spent Rs 30,000 for chemical fertilizer on the 100 cents. Besides labour cost, pesticides and irrigation came to Rs 50,000 to grow vegetables. I could not even get back the investment as the yield posted was very less. This year, I could prepare the organic fertilizer with just Rs 6000. As I have also shifted to drip irrigation, I spent Rs 20,000 for the 100 cents and I am now getting good income, Venkatachalam said, expressing his glee."

It is also found in fruits, vegetables, and meat.How does it work?Glutathione is a low molecular weight thiol-tripeptide that plays a prominent role in maintaining intracellular redox balance. In addition to its remarkable antioxidant properties, the discovery of its antimelanogenic properties has led to its promotion as a skin-lightening agent.Glutathione is involved in many processes in the body, including tissue building and repair, making chemicals and proteins needed in the body, and for the immune system.Glutathiones skin-lightening effects result from direct as well as indirect inhibition of the tyrosinase enzyme and switching from eumelanin to phaeomelanin production. It is available in oral, parenteral and topical forms.Currently, there are three trials that support the skin-lightening effect and good safety profile of topical and oral glutathione.Realising this growing trend of consumers wishing for a fairer skin, many pharmaceutical companies are developing different molecules for skin lightening. A lot is already known about topical de-pigmenting agents such as hydroquinone, glycolic acid, arbutin, kojic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E and niacinamide, all of which are readily available over-the-counter.Oral and intravenous glutathione have been available in some countries such as Philippines for many years. This drug has recently made inroads in other countries, including India.Although there is oral medication, the injection shots are considered and proven to be effective.Natural dietary sources of glutathione:Fresh fruits, vegetables, and nuts are natural sources of glutathione. Tomatoes, avocados, oranges, walnuts and asparagus are some of the most common edibles that help to increase levels of glutathione in the body. Whey protein is another rich source of glutathione and has been used to enhance systemic glutathione levels in cystic fibrosis.Pros of glutathione:People take glutathione for treating cataracts and glaucoma, preventing aging, treating alcoholism, asthma, cancer, heart disease, hepatitis, liver disease, diseases that weaken the bodys defence system, memory loss, Alzheimers, osteoarthritis, and Parkinsons disease. Glutathione is also used for maintaining the bodys defense system and in fighting metal and drug poisoning.Healthcare providers give glutathione as a shot (by injection into the muscle) for preventing poisonous side effects of cancer treatment (chemotherapy) and for treating the inability to father a child (male infertility).Healthcare providers also give glutathione intravenously (by injection into the vein, by IV) for preventing anemia in kidney patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment, preventing kidney problems after heart bypass surgery, treating parkinsons disease, improving blood flow and decreasing clotting in individuals with hardening of the arteries, treating diabetes, and preventing toxic side effects of chemotherapy.Does oral glutathione work?Once the glutathione goes into the stomach, it becomes useless and doesnt serve the purpose. Only when it is injected in the veins, it enters the blood and does its magic. Although there are a lot of studies, none could prove that oral glutathione is helpful.The industry is fooling the people in the name of glutathione pills and creams. Infact, grape weed extract and vitamin C helps better in skin lightening than glutathione tablets.The article is compiled by Dr Kannaiah Thallapally, consultant hair-transplant surgeon, cosmetodermotologist at Livyoung Anti-aging Clinic"

The newly-opened cafe, which is run by jail inmates serving life sentence, offers eatables and other products which, as the management proudly announces, are made in jail.To top it all, the notion of being served by jailbirds does not bother customers in the least. On the contrary, they appear to be intrigued by the idea. The ever-present crowd of patrons suggests the obvious lack of ""happy hours"". Many of those who visit the cafe once end up as regular customers and a stream of suggestions pours in.On a regular day at the cafe, Jai Chand, 49 and Yog Raj , 27, don chef 's hats and dish out orders with a brisk efficiency characteristic of professional cooks. Outside the kitchen, customers sit back amid the scenic environs, engrossed in books, pizza and piping hot chai. The chefs' life term at Kaithu Jail , is merely an incidental fact soon forgotten in the comforting aroma of fresh food. The location of the cafe at Takka Bench above the historic Ridge , en-route to the famous Jakhu temple assures a steady stream of visitors. The picturesque location, good food and the lure of books makes it a perfect draw for tourists. The library includes books by Chetan Bhagat, Nikita Singh, Jules Verne Sherlock Holmes and Robin Sharma.Subjects of environment, tourism and Shimla's history have also been covered.The cafe, which can accommodate 40 persons, has been built at a cost of Rs 20 lakh. It remains open from 10 am to 9pm.Besides tourists, the cafe also draws a number of local residents. Appreciating this concept of jail reforms, Shimla resident Nirupama Chaudhary has become a regular customer in the last one week. ""On completion of their sentence, inmates can run their own cafe or restaurant, which will make them self-dependent in future,"" she said.However, she feels readers of newspapers and periodicals should also be catered to. ""It is not possible to read books for hours.In case of hurry, we can go through newspapers and magazines while sipping tea or coffee,"" she suggested, adding that her favourite articles on the menu are pizza and burger.The menu includes tea, coffee, tomato soup, veg paneer puff, veg burger, cup cake, muffin, pastry, medium pizza, peanut cookies, cream roll and karara special, an improved version of hot dog. All these dishes are made in the jails of Kaithu and Kandaghat. Jakhu resident Ajay Sohan Lal said he has been a regular visitor since the day the book cafe opened. ""This is the best place and even the concept is new. I can have coffee while reading a book, which, otherwise, was not possible in the library located close to this cafe,"" he said.Lal wholeheartedly supports the concept of jail reforms. ""People make mistakes in life and everyone should be given the chance to repent and make a new beginning. Both Jai Chand and Yog Raj are very courteous and their service also is very good,"" he said.On his part, Jai Chand feels his role as chef makes incarceration a more humane experience. He has only completed eight years of his jail term but hopes to open his own book cafe on his release from jail. Going by the increasing business volume, people hope he makes it. ""The customer base is increasing and sales are picking up. At the moment, everyday sales are between Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000.This is expected to increase in the days to come,"" he says.The way he handles his responsibilities shows it is not just a job for him. ""This place matters. The cafe has given us a chance to connect with the outside world,"" he said.Yog Raj also said he loves interacting with people. He expressed gratitude to the authorities for giving him another chance and said he would make the most of it."

With the cost of production spiralling, farmers of milk-producing districts are distraught.Unable to get fodder in their vicinity, they source it from distant places at high costs. Despite a government incentive, the establishment of fodder banks and the recent hike in milk prices, farmers of Kolar, Mandya and Shivamogga, which are among the high milk-producing districts, are complaining about the increase in input costs.Dairy farmers of Mandya are looking at Mysuru, Chamarajanagar and other districts to source fodder. Paddy cultivation suffered owing to drought, and this has resulted in shortage of dry grass, said Satisha, a farmer from Budhanuru. Savithramma of Bellur said cattle required at least 15 kg of green fodder every day. She purchases fodder at Rs. 10 a kg  double the normal price of Rs. 5.Steep hikeIn Kolar, fodder availability has been adversely affected as farmers have turned to tomato cultivation, despite the administrations attempt to convince them to grow jowar, which yields good green fodder. With the onset of the tomato season, farmers have moved away from jowar for higher returns.In Shivamogga, the cost has risen steeply as a tonne of fodder, which cost about Rs. 5,800 in March/April 2016, is now being sold at Rs. 11,000 to milk producers coming under the Shivamogga Milk Union Ltd., which covers Shivamogga, Davangere and Chitradurga districts.The situation is similar in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi, where the cost of fodder has increased from Rs. 11 / Rs. 12 to Rs. 15 / Rs. 16 a kg.Sources in the Karnataka Milk Federation acknowledged the shortage but said the federation was confident of sailing through the dry season as many places in the high milk-producing centres had received rainfall.The Animal Husbandry Department confirmed that there was a shortage of fodder.We have established fodder banks but they can meet only part of the demand. Fodder is being given at highly subsidised cost of Rs. 2 a kg, an official said."

""I practice and train farmers on natural farming. ""In organic farming, cow dung from 20 cows is used annually for one acre of land. But in natural farming, the same amount is enough for 20 acres of land. In organic farming, farm yard manure is not very helpful for plants. But in natural farming, the Jeevamrutha mixture  consisting of fresh cow urine, cow dung, jaggery and gram flour  is more effective as the living microorganisms help improve soil quality,"" Rao explained, adding that organic farming is a European concept.Rao, who has a specialization in climate-resilient agriculture, will address the crowd at a two-day national summit on 'Innovative Approach to World Nutrition and Food Security ' at the Art of Living Intenational Center in Kanakapura on May 9 and 10.In Karnataka, sowing is done in June since rain is expected in July and August. ""But owing to climate change, we have been receiving copious rain only by September. So in North Karnataka, we have trained farmers to sow both tur dal and chickpea at the same time in the same farm so that they don't suffer crop loss even if one fails,"" Rao added."

The prices of green leafy vegetables have also gone up by 50 % and it is likely to escalate further by at least 50 % during the next fortnight, as indicated by vendors at Kaktives and Shaniwarkoot on Sunday. The increase in the prices of vegetables, which was bound to shoot up every passing week owing to shortage of water on account of the summer conditions and a third year of drought in the district, has hit hard families in the lower income group and the middle class. These sections have already been hit by steep increase in the prices of pulses and foodgrains, sugar and other commodities during the last two years. These families are now forced to cut down their consumption by half.A buyer said that he used to buy a kg of tomatoes once in three or four days till recently but is now buying only half a kilogram.He said that as the prices are bound to shoot up further very soon, we have to cut down our consumption further and need to be more economical while buying vegetables till the monsoon sets in and prices start falling.Vendors said that the prices were shooting up due to a fall in production in view of shortage of water, leading to a decline in arrivals in the wholesale markets.Meanwhile, a substantial stock of vegetables from the district went to Goa every day. Apparently, the typical demand-supply gap was growing and it would keep growing for at least three more months."

To the Ahmedabad crime world, these are aliases of criminals as colourful as their personas. Crime is perhaps the only profession where having an ominously threatening nickname is a good career move. Where Mumbai has `Tiger' Memon or `Chhota' Rajan, Ahmedabad has its own line-up of felons, identified by their aliases got from their looks, habits, modus operandi or physical traits.Ahmedabad's Spiderman is no cute crime-fighting webslinger. He is 32-year-old Omkar Bhadoria, a resident of Ranip, who has been named in more than 50 cases of murder, loot and burglaries. ""His special skill is using pipes to break into houses at night. He targets houses on the topmost floor of a building. He slides down the pipe from the terrace to the house, burgles it and slides down the pipe to safety even as people look for him on the stairs or the terrace,"" said police.Interestingly, Bhadoria does not flee the society. ""He crawls up the pipes to the terrace in an adjacent building tower and spends the night there.When dawn breaks, he escapes with the loot. He also keeps changing his house frequently to avoid getting caught,"" said the police, who gave him the nickname after discovering his modus operandi.Usually, the police have a limited role in the `naamkaran' of goons. Often, their gang members or locals give them such singular sobriquets. ""The names give them a unique identity. It also strikes fear in the hearts of locals and rivals,"" said a senior officer.Kalupur residents Satish Ruparelia and Raju Panchal murdered a businessman in Shahibaug, cut off his head and dumped it at Adalaj ni Vaav in the early 90's. ""When they went to jail, Ruparelia got the name `Badi Mundi' while Panchal became `Chhoti Mundi,"" he said. Similarly, Kalu `Gardan' of Juhapura who was arrested for his alleged involvement in the murder of social activist Nadeem Saiyed earned the nickname because he would always attack his victim on the neck first.""When the details of such men are entered into our records, we retain the nicknames to help us identify them easily,"" said police.This might be a tad difficult when it comes to Bakra, or should that be Bakras ? Vijay `Bakra' Chunara of Gota is an expert chain-snatcher and burglar. ""The 34-year-old has terrible hygiene. He hates taking baths and stinks so much that even when we arrest him, we make him stand downwind to avoid gagging,"" said a crime branch official. Smelly as a goat, it is easy to deduce how he ended up with his nickname.Then, there's Ajay `Bakra' of Sardarnagar who is notorious for stealing laptops, as well as snatching chains and cash. ""He is always seen chom ping on vegetables. He will walk past vegetable laaris and pick up carrots, radishes, tomatoes to munch. Due to this habit, people began calling him bakra,"" said police.Zakir Shaikh Vejalpur is `Chuha' because he is sharp as a rat and tough to catch. ""Shaikh, who is involved in about 20 cases of house break-ins, has sharp hearing which alerts him to the presence of people. He scuttles away, abandoning his work rather than be caught,"" said police.Ritesh Garange of Kubernagar who specialises in stealing laptops from cars is known as `Andho' as he acts blind and fools his victims into belie ving he is innocent. ""When the victim looks elsewhere, Garange will steal laptops or other valuables from the vehicle within seconds. He operates mainly in areas like Satellite and CG Road,"" said police. Pappu Sharma of Vatva, who is accused of theft and robbery, is called Pappayyu by his gang as the 48-yearold's face resembles the papaya fruit.Gufran Pathan (37) of Rakhial who is accused of theft and loot is known as Hanuman due to his resemblance to the Monkey God.`Mungdo' is the moniker of Rajesh Jiliya, a 35-year-old from Kubernagar who steals insignificant things inclu ding animals like goats. ""He hardly speaks. So, people call him mungdo (dumb),"" said police.Aman Pathan, a 43-year-old from Juhapura who was charged with theft and possession of arms is known as `Bhangariyo', because he was a scrap dealer before he turned to crime. Kirit `Dhoom' got his nickname after a tipoff led cops to him for masterminding highway robberies using high-speed bikes. His MO was similar to ones used in the movie `Dhoom' and his gang members christened him with the nickname.In many cases, gang mates and even the police don't know the real names of the gangsters since they are known only by their nicknames. DCP Deepen Bhadran said, ""Aliases of names are an important part of police records and it plays a significant role in crime detection. Many criminals are known by their aliases whereas their names may not strike a chord."""

Only if you are a foreigner,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/non-veg-fare-only-if-you-are-a-foreigner/articleshow/58571263.cms,2017-05-08,,The Times Of India,"If you are not a foreigner , you will not be served non-vegetarian food at private hospitals in Ahmedabad. Hospitals, in general, are not known for serving appetizing meals . However, patients here face a different sort of problem, revealed a Mirror Check. Hospitals here force you to follow vegetarianism, especially if you are Indian. They either flatly refuse to serve non-vegetarian food to Indians, or ask you to shift to the international ward to get the fare of your choice. These same hospitals have no such restrictions for foreigners admitted there. In their defence, the hospitals claim that they serve vegetarian food to Indian patients 'to respect the sentiments of the majority', but make an exception for foreign patients 'as they aren't used to vegetarian food'.UN-FARE PRACTICE AT HOSPITALSMirror visited eight hospitals to check the ground reality. Of these, Sterling, Columbia Asia, Zydus, and SAL -- serve vegetarian fare to patients and their relatives. They also do not allow people to eat non-vegetarian food on the premises, even if it has been brought from home. Of the four remaining hospitals, CIMS and HCG serve non-vegetarian fare but only to foreign patients. They do not cook the food on the premises. Instead, they order it from eateries. At Apollo hospital, non-vegetarian food is prepared on the premises and served freely to foreign patients. Indians are served non-vegetarian food only if there is a ""medical requirement"". Non-vegetarian food is prepared and served to both Indian and foreign patients at Krishna Shalby, provided the Indian patients shift to the international wing of the hospital. None of these hospitals have issued or put up any official notification in this regard.Taking objection to the unfair treatment, bank officer J K Nair (49), whose wife was recently hospitalised, says, ""This is discrimination, plain and simple. We cannot be treated as second-grade people in our own country for something as rudimentary as our food choices. If hospitals think it is okay for a foreign patient to consume non-vegetarian food, what ground do they have to deny us the same option?"" Mohammed Jamaluddin (52), an engineer whose nephew has been hospitalised for the past 10 days, says, ""The hospital may not want to cook non-vegetarian food in its kitchen but they should at least allow us to bring it from home. We respect other people's feelings. We can eat it in a secluded corner or in our room with our relatives.I have been to hospitals in Mumbai and they do not have any such restrictions. No one should be deprived of the basic freedom to eat what they want."" Businessman Abbas Manji Pir Bhai also pointed out that such discrimination existed only here. ""My daughter was admitted to a hospital in Delhi for afew weeks. They offered non-vegetarian fare to all patients, whether Indian or foreign,"" says the 67-year-old. Satbir Singh (24), an engineer, believes food goes a long way in curing a patient as much as medicines do. ""Being a non-vegetarian, I know that chicken soup would make me feel much better than tomato soup would. So long as I am having it in my private space, it should not be a problem for anybody.""Meanwhile, hospitals claim they do not offer non-vegetarian fare to Indian patients out of respect. Dr Nikhil Lala, centre head of Sterling says, ""I see no need for our hospital to provide non-vegetarian food as it is not a medical need. We ensure that the patient's protein requirement is fulfilled through vegetarian food."" Bhanupratap Hada, operation head of Zydus confirms, ""We do not serve non-vegetarian food in our hospitals. We have our own kitchen and patients are not allowed food from outside."" SAL Hospital refused to issue an official statement, but clarifies that it serves only vegetarian food.Apollo hospital states, ""A variety of specialised meals, including non-vegetarian fare, are provided to our patients on the advice of our doctors and dieticians. We have separate kitchen and storage facilities for cooking vegetarian and non-vegetarian food items."" Dr Bharat Gadhvi, regional director of HCG Gujarat, admits that Indians and foreigners were offered separate fares at the hospital. ""We get nonvegetarian food from outside for international patients only. For the rest of the patients and their relatives everything is strictly vegetarian.""'80PER CENT PATIENTS ARE VEGETARIANS'On allowing non-vegetarian food only to foreigners, Dr Anish Chandarana, executive director of CIMS hospital clarifies, ""It is hard for international patients to sustain a vegetarian diet as they are not used to it. Hence, we get it for them from hotels. The reason why hospitals have adopted a vegetarian- only policy for Indians is because 80 per cent of patients tend to be vegetarian and they may have a very strong emotional reaction to people who eat non-vegetarian food around them."" Explaining why Indian patients have to be shifted to another wing if they want to have non-vegetarian fare, Shanay Vikram Shah, director of Shalby hospitals says, ""We have a separate kitchen on the top floor for non-vegetarian food. The international wing is located on the floor below it and all the patients there are provided non-vegetarian food. If there are any Indian patients who need non-vegetarian fare, they can have it after shifting to the international wing.""DIFFERENT CITIES, DIFFERENT POLICIESInterestingly, some hospitals which have branches in Ahmedabad as well as other cities have policies that differ according to the city it is in. For example, Columbia Asia of Ahmedabad allows only vegetarian but their Bangalore branch has no restrictions upon non-vegetarian food. Gaurav Anand, general manager of Columbia Asia, confirms they allow ""only vegetarian"" food in the hospital. However, Pratyush Srivastava, general manager of Columbia Asia Hospital at Whitefield in Bangalore says, ""We serve non-vegetarian food to patients and their kin. We do not allow outside food in the hospital.The food served here is prepared in our kitchen as per guidelines from the dietician."" A hospital has every right to institute rules, but then it should be implemented without discrimination, avers designer Reuben Vaz (23). ""If their policy is pro-vegetarian, then it should be the same for everyone. If the Indians are not being provided non-vegetarian food, then foreigners should not be provided the same. It is not like foreigners have never had vegetarian food in their entire lives. It shouldn't be a problem for them to survive on it for a few days. People should not be divided based on their food choices,"" he says."

(Right) The logo of the canteen.Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Friday finalised modalities to launch the ambitious Indira Canteen project offering subsidised breakfast and meals to the urban poor in Bengaluru.At a meeting at his official residence, Siddaramaiah directed starting the project from August 15.The state government is pumping in Rs 100 crore for the project while the BBMP will be the nodal agency for its implementation.Mayor G Padmavathi told reporters after the meeting that canteens will be made up of pre-cast structures manufactured by KEF Infra at their Tamil Nadu facility.The firm has quoted Rs 32 lakh for constructing each canteen with a carpet area of 860 sq ft. She said Siddaramaiah has directed officials to negotiate with KEF Infra to reduce the construction cost.Padmavathi said, There will be 199 canteens including the one at the BBMP head office and 28 kitchens, one each in every Assembly constituency in the city. These canteens can accommodate 70 to 80 people at a time. There will be a coupon system offering meals and tiffin to a maximum of 250 people in one slot.The Mayor said each canteen will have two toilets, a CCTV camera and food a distribution court. The utensils will belong to the state government so that services are not hampered in case food supply contract is terminated and transferred to another agency.The contracts will be finalised by May 30 and work would commence from June 1. By August 1, these canteens will be completely ready to start the programme from August 15, said Padmavathi.Regarding the menu, she said beaten rice bath, uppittu (upma) and idli will be offered for breakfast while the meal will consist of sambar, rasam, rice and pickle.On Sundays, there will be one special item like tomato rice, jeera rice, puliyogare and lemon rice. BBMP commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad said locations for setting up the canteens have been identified. He said the canteens have been designed by different architects.Stree Shakti Sanghas to cook mealsThe government will rope in Stree Shakti Sanghas (SSS) for preparing meals, said Mayor Padmavathi. At least 33% of these canteens and their kitchens will be managed by the SSS, said the Mayor adding that the idea is to empower these SSS."

The first sign of stirring was with the opening of Rakesh Talwars Spare Kitchen II, followed by the jazzy and spacious Matahari night club and now, most recently Swey.Spread across a sprawl of 14,000 square feet, Swey can accommodate 400 people at a go. The eatery, located on the malls level four, is whatever you want it to be: a caf, a pub, a bar or a restaurant that serves you wholesome food, under corporate chef Clyde Comellos direction. Owners Gaurav Dabrai, Vicky and Kabir Luthria, (who also own the kitschy Dishikiyaaon at Bandra Kurla Complex and Copa at Juhu), have utilised the space well, ensuring pockets of private party spaces for large groups ranging from 10 to 30 people.We love the restaurants direction pole that points to all their outposts across the city. Fun elements like a phone booth where you can step in to take a call, and a mandatory stop for all diners: a copper swing for selfies  are the lighter design touches.The rooftop bar has a drinks menu thats by far the best we have tried in a long time. Food and drink meet in two cocktails that we tried out. The first: a cheese me martini (Rs. 550) does not overwhelm the palate but makes its presence felt with the blue cheese and stuffed olives. The second, an apple a day (Rs. 550), which is vodka mixed with a buttery apple jam, comes with an apple crumble rim. If you like to mix your dessert and drinks, this one is for you. But the drink, who knows Donald (Rs. 650), with bourbon-soaked cranberries, with homemade bitters and sugar, steals our hearts. One of our dinner companions succumbs to healthier option: a kale and hearty (Rs. 500), a light vodka-based drink which tastes of a cooling cucumber and kale juice, an admirable combination.The food and drinks menus have been designed by outlet chef Hansel Baptista, and from the first bite of magic mushrooms (Rs. 350), in which the crispy roasted fungi act as makeshift sliders holding cheese and beetroot slices, we know we are in for a treat. The wood-fired pizzas are juicy square flat breads, which are easier to eat. The smoky salmon and ricotta pizza (Rs. 750) has the sweetness of red onions balanced by the sourness of tiny balsamic jelly beans. The feta beignets (Rs. 375) are deep-fried and bland but for the addition of sweet tomato jam reserve. The stuffed calamari (Rs. 500) with a centre-filling of masala prawn chilly fry is chewy, but the zing of East Indian bottle masala dominates pleasantly.Chef Baptista presents the duck waffle two ways but in a croissant just for us to try. The chunks of duck pieces are pan-seared and medium-rare cooked in a pomegranate jus, and a tangy duck confit with orange tang and spices. We are instant fans of the healthy veg spaghetti (Rs. 450) that has thinly sliced veggies as noodles, and spiced roast cashews tossed in a Himalayan rhododendron vinaigrette that adds crunch. The deconstructed ham and cheese toasty salad (Rs. 450) falls flat for its bland dressing as we dont enjoy bite-size pieces of ham slices between toasted bread.For the main course we settle for a kimchi fried rice (Rs. 500) which is peppered with spiced tofu, fried lotus root and thin strips of noori. A Korean dish which traditionally comprises a broken egg, we are served a sunny side up, which we prefer as is. The dish is a roller-coaster of textures  the crunch of lotus stem, and raw vegetables, the softness of tofu pieces and al dente rice cooked in a fiery red sauce.By now, we are stuffed, but theres plenty of room for dessert. We begin with three shots (Rs. 750), which can be ordered sans alcohol too: a negroni with 55% dark chocolate, cinnamon flavoured yogurt and orangechilo cheesecake. The negroni shot has a potato chip dunked in chocolate sauce, while the flavoured yoghurt needs more cinnamon. The orangechilo cheesecake rules our palate with its tangy presence. The syrups are all house made and the absence of synthetic syrup ensures we wont croak with a hoarse voice the next day.Dive into dessertsA fitting end to the meal is the desserts. The bittersweet symphony of theres bourbon in my cheesecake (Rs. 330) topped with a smoked honey is a hit. But the pice de rsistance is the hazelnut entremet. The dessert has a crunchy ganache base topped with a hazelnut meringue thats served with a coffee amaretto Bavarian ice cream with caramel. Self-taught baker and dessert chef Tanvi Kirawant, or as she likes to call herself the Nagpur tigress, tells it takes her 50 steps to make the dessert. We manage to polish it off in five, quick bites.Swey at Atria, Worli, is open from 6 p.m. to 1.30 a.m.; 9820436666"
5922f6277be9e01fc7f5c813,Villagers around Koradi eat and breathe fly ash,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/villagers-around-koradi-eat-and-breathe-fly-ash/articleshow/58387105.cms,2017-04-27,,The Times Of India,"Driving a motorcycle is a risky business in Suradevi, a village 3km away from the Thermal Power Station at Koradi (KTPS). With the wind comes clouds of fly-ash in the village, blurring the vision.The effects of pollution starts from a radius of at least 10km from the plant  from the hems of Nagpur city  but it intensifies as you cross villages and move towards the plant. The damage is not just restricted to health but also crops and drinking water.Last week, TOI reported about environmentalists questioning the all-is-well air quality monitoring data of Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and Mahagenco, that runs KTPS. While both agencies boast of low emissions of total particulate matter (TPM)  a total of hazardous particles suspended in air  scores of villagers living around the plant are suffering since years. And the three new units, which were dedicated to the nation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 14, have only added to their woes.""We are virtually forced to breathe, eat and drink fly ash. The vegetables that are growing in the fields are covered with it. If we keep papads to dry or a bucket of water outside, they get coated with a layer of ash,"" says Rekha Kautare , a Suradevi resident.The fly-ash-coated vegetables grown at Koradi are consumed by Nagpurians too as they are sold in the city. ""There is a steady flow of vegetables throughout the year from villages around Koradi. They are washed at source point itself as the people will not buy such vegetables. They also have less shelf life,"" said Suresh Jawande, a vegetable wholesaler at Cotton Market.Till a few years ago, the villagers here would grow a variety of leafy vegetables, tomatoes and other greens. ""Since last year, we have stopped growing them because the quality and quantity was not good. Many times, our crops wilt due to high deposition of fly-ash. If our yield in normal conditions should have been 75%, now it is only 30-35%,"" says Ramesh Kawde, a farmer of the same village.In 2012, TOI had visited Lonkhairi and nearby villages where crops were damaged by fly-ash. A joint survey was done by Mahagenco and agriculture department officials. The report submitted by them stated that the damage had occurred but talks of compensation allegedly remains on paper.That time, villagers growing oranges had said that they will chop down the trees if fly-ash problem was not solved.Today, many have done it in surrounding villages. ""Some villagers had orange orchards. The fly-ash used to get heavily deposited on the flowers and the fruits wouldn't grow. Yields went down by half and therefore, they decided to chop down the trees,"" says Gunvanta Raut, former sarpanch of Ghogali village, located 5-6km from KTPS.Sanjay Bhoyar, professor of soil science at Dr Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth (PKV), who has done a PhD on use of fly-ash in agriculture, says that fly-ash deposition is extremely harmful for the crops. ""It gets deposited on hydrathodes of leaves affecting the transpiration process and thus, hampering photosynthesis,"" he told TOI.Bhoyar further says that if the electro-static precipitators (ESPs) function properly, then the emissions should go down by 99.99%. ""If ESPs are not functioning properly, then Mahagenco authorities should take immediate remedial steps,"" he added.Bhoyar rued that even though Mahagenco's predecessor MSEB had been told that use of wet fly-ash was good for agriculture, no steps had been taken by the authorities.Crop damage can be seen but the bigger damage is to the health, which is not fully visible right now. ""My mother-in-law is suffering from asthma since last few years and my son repeatedly suffers from cough and cold. Five months ago, an old woman in our village died of an asthma attack,"" says Kautare.Respiratory problems and other health ailments have been haunting the villagers since last many years. TOI visited five villages within 10km of KTPS where residents complained of health problems due to air pollution. Surprisingly, none of these most-affected villages are chosen for air quality monitoring by MPCB or Mahagenco. The list of villages where monitoring was done was provided to TOI by MPCB.Dr Gyaneshwar Dhanole , a medical practitioner in Mahadula, another village close to KTPS, concurs with the villagers. ""Respiratory ailments are common in the area. Those who fall prey to them are unable to recuperate completely. While in other places kids get viral fever mostly when season changes. However, here they suffer from it all the year round,"" he says.Even a village like Bailwada, which is some 10km from the plant, suffers from KTPS pollution. ""Our crop yield has reduced by 20% due to fly-ash. Asthma is a common problem. Every morning, we find our utensils, vehicles, in fact everything, covered with a thick layer of dry ash,"" says resident Rishi Dakhore.While Mahagenco claims that it holds health camps in the affected villages, residents said that the company had held an eye check-up camp. ""They have never held a camp for overall health,"" was the common refrain of residents of the villages TOI visited.Dr Sanjay Jaiswal, deputy director of health (Nagpur), says that no health camps are held. ""We have primary health centres (PHCs) in villages where people can go for treatment,"" he adds. However, most villagers prefer to go to private hospitals in Koradi and Nagpur as ""PHCs do not give prompt service.""In an earlier clarification sent to TOI, Mahagenco had denied ill-effects of air pollution on the ground that there was no such data with the PHCs. Since no camps were held, there is no data too.If crop damage and air pollution was not enough, KTPS is also polluting drinking water in many villages. ""Mahagenco releases water through a canal near our village. Sometimes oil flows with water and pollutes our groundwater. When we complain, the officials just take perfunctory steps to solve the problem,"" says Maharoti Bhange from Ghogli.A TOI photographer attempted to drink the well water but was unable to do so because of the atrocious taste.Bhoyar says, ""If the ESPs don't work properly, mercury is emitted, which oxidizes and converts into mercury oxide. When it gets dissolves in water and enters the food chain through fish, it is very dangerous for the nervous system of humans.""Frequent flooding, especially during monsoons is another curse of the plant for Ghogli villagers. ""Water from Totladoh collects in a pond near our village which is then transported to the plant through a canal. This canal is not de-silted regularly which results in flooding,"" says sarpanch of the village Gajanan Wankhede.Even though Mahagenco admitted to the problem after complaints made by Wankhede, the company has not taken up rehabilitation work under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). This is evident from an internal communication between two chief engineers through a letter on October 30, 2015. ""The buildings in the village should be shifted as per the directions of sub-divisional officer (SDO) under CSR,"" the letter states.""Our records on CSR activities run into voluminous pages and cannot be provided over mail or phone,"" a KTPS official told TOI.Meanwhile, Nagpur city is also feeling the effects pollution. When activist Ankita Shah recently shared TOI's story about KTPS pollution on the social media, Nagpurians complained that the pollution has reached city's northern areas. ""A friend complains that he has his office at Nelson Square, and if windows are left open for half-an-hour, he gets asthma attack,"" commented Deepanshu Khirwadkar.Madhurita Dhar, a resident of Mankapur, says, ""Residents living on higher floors are constantly exposed to dry ash. If we don't do dusting every day, a thick layer gets deposited on everything.""Based on TOI's reports, Shah has filed a complained with the PMO which has asked the member secretary of the pollution control board to file an action taken report within 15 days, which is before April 30. Some environmentalists see this as a meaningless exercise.""The pollution control board's figures were shockingly lower than the norms, which is well-nigh impossible,"" said Kaustav Chatterjee, member of an NGO which works in the green sector. ""The MPCB cannot be expected to conduct an enquiry on itself."""

Apart from milk, homegrown dairy giant Amul will now procure and sell fruits and vegetables at their outlets.The Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) that markets dairy products under brand Amul is seriously explring possibility of buying fresh vegetables and fruits directly from farmers in the villages from where it procures milk on daily basis.For this, GCMMF has roped in the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) to carry out technical evaluation of the project.To begin with, Amul is looking to start selling vegetables and fruits in Ahmedabad where it runs over 200 parlours.""On January 26, we had signed a MoU with Gujarat government to help farmers get better price for their agri produce,"" said R S Sodhi, managing director of GCMMF,Amul may replicate the Delhi model of Safal that is engaged in retailing of fresh fruits and vegetables along with value-added products, he said. Safal, the fruit and vegetable arm of Mother Dairy, a subsidiary of NDDB was the first company to organize the fruits and vegetables business in the country.The proposal came up for discussion during the recent board meeting of GCMMF in which chairman of all the 17 district dairy unions of Gujarat who are member unions of the federation had participated at Palanpur.""We are studying the procedure on how to start procurement and marketing of different vegetables including tomatoes, cauliflowers, brinjals, onions among others,"" GCMMF's chairman Jetha Patel told TOI.""If we succeed in our study, the vegetables will be marketed under brand Amul and will be procured by our member unions,"" he said, adding that the federation officials have been asked to carry out enterprise study and give their report.""This will not only benefit the vegetable producers but also benefit consumers as the role played by middlemen will get eliminated. Producers dealing in horticulture will get better price while consumers will get the agri produce at affordable price with trusted brand name of Amul,"" he said."
5922f7ab7be9e01fc0070997,Reflections on the election of our time,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/reflections-on-the-election-of-our-time/article17464130.ece,2017-03-15,,The Hindu,"The Uttar Pradesh election results are like a riddle wrapped in an enigma. The sheer scale of the victory, the arithmetic, shows it was a tsunami that no one had predicted. More than the act of prediction in the form of the exit polls that confounded us, the problem lay in deciphering the results. At the macrolevel, it is like watching the arrival of a juggernaut, whose presence now looks inevitable, but which still requires an explanation of how it came there. At a microlevel, one looks at pieces which make as little sense as the whole picture. It is not the immediacy of the result that challenges us but what it implies for the future.This is a strange election where one man became a national phenomenon. As a wag put it, Narendra Modi became a final cause, remote cause and immediate cause of the election results. He represented the idea of India the majority wanted. People believed his words, and his utterances such as development, nationalism and Make in India acquired a shelf life beyond the original meaning of these terms. What Mr. Modi seemed to convey is what I call a lowest common denominator democracy. He has created a  roti, kapda aur makan (food, clothing and shelter) imagination for the new middle classes. His communalism  which he wore like a badge, pretending it is a patriotism  is so blatant and confident that it challenges the old tenets of secularism making it irrelevant. When a Prime Minister, not merely a head of a party, refuses to allocate a single seat to a Muslim candidate in U.P., the message is clear. He has pushed out an old political vocabulary which already had a shop-soiled quality. His style of electoral ambush of appropriating the Oppositions favourite stereotypes was acutely tactical.Consider the issue of demonetisation. He was not devaluing currency but instead rendering some older political styles effete. The Congress and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) could no longer claim to be the spokespersons of the poor. Ironically, Mr. Modi made demonetisation speak a political rather than an economic language. He demonetised political currency and challenged the bankability of terms such as secularism. Simultaneously, he appropriated the pro-poor platform by pretending to be anti-rich. He became an anti-corruption crusader in that sense, telling the poor that he was their way out of their current world. His combination of patriotism and anti-poverty became a potent brew.The strategyLet me be clear. It is a strategy that we have to understand. Mr. Modi formulated a symbolic strategy, while BJP president Amit Shah spelt out the tactics on the ground. He created a sense of the new, promising a sense of the world by appealing to demography and a new generation. He did it in two ways. He cleared the decks by treating Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi as old furniture. But he went beyond this by suggesting almost blatantly that the stereotypes of caste and ideology were outdated because change has dated them. Such categories create the captive minds of the old electoral politics.What he was offering was a simple, aspirational, mobile society where those at the bottom of the pyramid  a clichd word for the poor  feel a different sense of possibilities. His overt change in style, dress, and his muted muscularity all helped create an effective veneer around his political style. This not only added to his vote catching power among Dalits but also made old warhorses such as BSP leader Mayawati appear like yesterdays newspaper. What Mr. Modi was signalling to each caste category which had frozen into a vote bank was that caste alone would not work. One needed development, innovation, a new sense of energy, and not the old lethargy of waiting for reservation. Mr. Modi hinted that the politics of ressentiment had to be replaced by a strategy of mobility.Capturing the imaginationThird, Mr. Modi realised, that the medias understanding of the social order was incomplete. He had a better hearing aid to listen to what I call grassroots voices. They spoke a different language of immediacy unembellished by the rhetoric of concepts. Mr. Modis concepts such as Make in India were more performative, promising delivery of the goods and competence better than any of the words that the socialists or the Congress offered to the people. It is in this sense that one has to understand that his victory was not merely an organisational victory created by Mr. Shah and the millions of party workers on the ground but also a literal capturing of the mass imagination. It was so total that it was virtually emasculating to the Opposition. Brutally put, it went beyond a capture of votes to a seduction of the imagination. It captured not only the working concepts of todays electoral language but also the very grids of thought that determine the thought styles of the future. It is in recognising this that this article, which till now appears like a compilation of what made the BJP tick, becomes a symptomatology of fears. Let me admit that I might have got my psephology wrong but my intuition tells me that my sense of the future might be pathetically and prophetically right.An epitaph for the oldThink of a few simple facts. Here is a party which even after the Gujarat riots is virtually contemptuous or indifferent to the Muslim, clear that this critical election did not need the help of any Muslim candidates. Mr. Modi has also told Dalits that their politics, like minoritarianism, is doomed. The two great concepts that created the compost heap of Indian electoral politics, the vote banks which have acquired a reified life of their own, are socialism and secularism. Mr. Modi, in rendering them effete, has also created a set of closures we must understand. It is clear that while mobility is an aspirational dream, dissent today is an almost extinct possibility between the inanity of the left and the liberals and the hostility of the BJP regime. What we are facing is individual aspiration but a death of the old categories which at one time created the romance and the Utopian around words such as justice and equality.The U.P. elections show that the old covenant around the concepts we once held sacred is dead. The hegemony of the BJP-Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-Bajrang Dal combine is almost clear. What we face is what I am going to call the closure of the Indian mind. There are few possibilities of new political dreams. Mr. Modi is offering a straitjacket of a narrow idea of development and globalisation which contain no alternative possibilities, no dissent, no side bets. It is not a post-truth society we are confronting but a creation of a captive mind. This society by choosing Mr. Modi has closed itself to many great imaginations. What we see is not a new generation speaking a new liberated politics but a bowdlerised society oozing simplicities, created by the masterminds of propaganda. India, like the United States, has today become a collection of hard hat minds, facing a tragedy where the aspiration is global but the categories are parochial while masquerading themselves as national. Mr. Modis victory signals the victory of the parochial and affordably mediocre over any vision of the cosmopolitan or plural. Deep down, it is the future which we have lost today. This is Indian democracys most ironic gift.Shiv Visvanathan is Professor, Jindal Global Law School and Director, Centre for the Study of Knowledge Systems, O.P. Jindal Global University"

Photo: R.V. MoorthyIn Barkheda village of Badayun, agitated villagers pounce on me to complain that instead of four-time BJP MLA Ram Sewak Patel, the Bharatiya Janata Party has selected businessman Mahesh Gupta, an outsider. Sher Singh Chauhan, a young BJP worker, and Satbir Singh Chauhan, a VHP activist, are the most vocal in this Thakur-dominated village, where all  including Valmikis and Mauryas  but the Muslims are likely BJP voters.Ram Sewakji will fight as an Independent, Satbir Singh says. He is the Hindutva face here; the RSS also wanted Patel but didnt succeed in prevailing on the BJP leadership. Well all work for him. Suddenly, his mobile phone rings  Ram Sewak has got the Shiv Sena ticket, he announces, and a cheer goes up.Saying that Mr. Patels fellow Kurmis, traditionally BJP-backers, will shift with him, Satbir Singh claims that Kurmis in the neighbouring Shekhupur seat, too, will vote against the BJP.Less than an hour later, in Konar, also in Badayun, the majority Jatavs are rooting for the Bahujan Samaj Party. But the village also has Khatiks and Dhobis, Dalit communities who traditionally back the BJP. As I talk to the Jatavs, an SUV sweeps in: the BJPs Naresh Singh Patel, a Kurmi, jumps out. He has come to seek votes for not the BJP but the Shiv Sena. Why?[BJP president] Amit Shah had promised to select candidates on the basis of a survey. That hasnt been done; the BJP wont get a majority, an angry Mr. Patel says.  Modiji ka hawa nikal gaya (Modis balloon has been punctured).As I drive through western U.P., I find similar stories of young dynasts or of outsiders  such as the party-hopping Avtar Singh Badana, a Gujjar millionaire from Haryanas Faridabad  getting ticket, of effigies of Mr. Shah being burnt or of protests being staged.Indeed, the BJP did not need irate party workers at this stage. The Hindu-Muslim polarisation that powered the BJP to a sweep in the 2014 general elections in U.P. is muted, the high the party experienced after last years surgical strikes against Pakistan has evaporated with demonetisation. Today, the partys old core voters are intact, but there is some attrition in the two sections that it was hoping would see it through  upper castes and the most backward castes.In Budhana in Muzaffarnagar, a large section of Jat farmers are with the BJP, but some are considering other options. With demonetisation, the BJP has hurt everyone; farmers like us have been destroyed. Well vote for Ajit Singhs party, said Balbir Singh.In western U.P.s district courts, upper caste lawyers are divided. And Kulbhushan Shatma, a Brahmin, is clear, The BJP is on the wane.The RSS that worked very hard in 2014, appear to be more relaxed now. Kamal Purwar in Bareilly backs Sangh spokesperson Manmohan Vaidyas controversial statement on the need to end reservation (even though similar remarks by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat before the Bihar polls damaged the BJPs support base among the MBCs )."

Its their ATM in fact. The rural economy here would have been battered but for African Tall Maize (ATM).The crop is providing an assured and steady income for farmers while also boosting dairy farming with a regular supply of fodder for cattle. ATM, a low water-intensive crop, is being grown throughout the year now as a fodder crop.Concerted efforts by local farmers, the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) and the Kolar district administration in encouraging cultivation of ATM are now paying dividends.Suresh is among the many farmers in Doddahasahalla village of Kolar taluk who have entered into an agreement with the local milk cooperative union to grow ATM. ""Earlier, I used to grow tomato or other vegetables, he says. The problem with tomato is that you are never sure of the income. If all goes well, I might make Rs 1.5 lakh per acre in one season and almost nothing the next.""Fed up with unpredictable rains and unreliable support prices, Suresh decided to grow ATM. Now he is assured of around Rs 50,000 per acre with the ATM fodder pre-sold to dairy farmers in his village.M Venkatesh, a farmer of E Kamballi village is an ATM fan too. ""Earlier, it was difficult to get fodder, especially in the summer.We used to import dried fodder from Andhra or Tamil Nadu which is not good for cattle,"" he said. It was also a costly affair, as each kilo of dry fodder costs Rs 10-15. Due to ATM initiative ,farmers like Venkatesh are now getting fresh fodder for less than half that amount.Dry fodder, according to Dr Chennakeshava, deputy director of animal husbandry, causes a lot of complications for cattle. ""Apart from causing blisters in their mouths, dry fodder results in kidney stones among cattle and reduces the quality and quantity of milk produced,"" he said.Dr Srinivas Gowda, deputy manager of KMF, said that since November 2016, the states Animal Husbandry Department and KMF have distributed almost 70,000 mini-kits of ATM seeds. He said agreements are being made with farmers to grow all the fodder that is required to feed cattle in the district. ""ATM fodder has increased the quantity of milk generated by two to three litres per animal, he added.Speaking to New Indian Express, Dr K V Thrilok Chandra, deputy commissioner of Kolar district, explained that such a project was essential, as 90 per cent of the 2.76 lakh heads of cattle in the district were milch cows. ""Since starting this project, the solid not fat (SNF) content of milk too has increased, making farmers eligible for incentives offered by the state government,""he said.Though there are several other projects to improve water availability, and others are being implemented in the district, the ATM project has impacted many people in a short period. Maintaining that Kolar is the first district where fodder cultivation is being taken up on a large scale, he said the model can be emulated elsewhere to ensure income security for farmers."

A wide range of mangoes, including those grown in the district and from other parts of the state and foreign countries, were on display. A stall by Central Horticultural Experiment Station, Hirehalli, has displayed varieties of jackfruit for tasting as well.The cardamom and black pepper vines developed by Appangala Spices Research Station was another attraction for the farmers. The officials said that bush pepper can be cultivated on the terrace of the house as well.The Forest department had kept the saplings of silver oak, wild jackfruit, balanji, bamboo, holemathi and shivani for display and sale. In addition, nutrients developed by the research centres for vegetables and flowers were on display. Machineries like sprinkler, pepper separating machine, tree cutter, homemade juice attracted the onlookers.Indian Horticultural Research Centre director Dr M R Dinesh told DH that there has been decline in the use of fruits in the recent past. India was producing 170 million tonne fruits annually in the past. This has increased to 284 million tonne in the last three years. However, the farmers do not have knowledge on marketing tactic. The growers should know the climatic condition in their area and then select the fruits for cultivation.The research centre has given priority to locally available mangoes. Appemidi trees are felled in Shivamogga, Sagar and Theerthahalli regions. We are making a study on the medicinal values of the produce. There has been discussion on introducing Appemidi in the modern market as well, he explained.Shyamala Shastri of Prakrithi Food Products said, A few individuals spoke lightly when I experimented on preparing juice from cashew apple.

In fact, ads have a two-way link with society. Firstly, ads reflect the prevailing social mores and preferences of the people.For example, the matrimonial ads in India at one time used to seek as groom in order of preference: doctors, engineers, chartered accountants and, as last resort, professors. Some were even more categorical in specifying that the brides family would consider only doctors having degrees from UK and engineers from IITs. Then, over time, with the rising flow of Indian IT professionals abroad, such people working in USA, and Europe began to occupy the pride of place in the list.For some families, apart from enjoying a better material standard of living, staying abroad had the further attraction that it would enable the bride to stay away from the in-laws family. More recently, with MBAs  particularly from the top IIMs  typically earning more than engineers, IIM MBAs have entered the list. Also, an increasing number of matrimonial ads are asking for working brides, instead of housewives, to supplement family income. At the same time, the proliferation of fairness cream ads testifies the premium that the Indian society, by and large, still places on fair skin.It is also interesting to observe how the products promoted by the ads have changed over time. With rising affluence (and aspirations) of the new generation along with easier availability of bank loans for consumer products, the ads for simple consumer goods like basic soaps, detergents and tooth pastes are giving way to more upscale products like body perfumes, air conditioners, motor bikes, cars, LED TVs, smartphones, jewellery, diamonds, flats and villas.Secondly, advertisers  through their ads and promotional campaigns  try to change the tastes, habits, choices and the aspirations of the public. They would make you believe that life is largely meaningless if you dont have a smart phone, shoes, watch, perfume, motorbike, car of a specific brand to distinguish you from the hoi polloi or to make a fashion statement for you.Advertisers particularly target children as, apart from being more impressionable, they are having an increasing say in family purchase decisions in todays society. In addition, investing in changing their preferences is likely to yield higher returns as their life span is longer.In this game of marketing and promotion, celebrities play a significant role. This is an age-old technique. Older people would remember seeing ads in newspapers and movie theatres (long before the advent of TVs) depicting film stars like Nargis or Madhubala using Lux soap every day. The same tradition is continuing, except that the range of products promoted by film stars and sports personalities has widened enormously. Even some state governments are employing such personalities as brand ambassadors for the purpose of attracting tourists or investments.Why do companies pay enormous sums to hire the services of such celebrities to promote their brands? There are two possible reasons. One, the face of a celebrity attracts the viewers attention immediately to the ad and the product stays in the mind of the viewer through association.Second, the fact that a company can afford to pay the huge sum to the celebrity implies that the product must be a good one bringing a lot of revenue. That helps establish the quality of the product in the minds of prospective buyers.Should celebrities be held accountable for the quality of the product or the service being advertised by them? True, it is not possible for an outsider to know fully about the quality (including any fraudulent claims made by the company).Product qualityYet, the celebrities  because of their celebrity status being used to sell the product or service to unsuspecting people  should exercise due diligence before endorsing. Since they are earning huge money, at least they should be made to pay some monetary penalty if they are found endorsing a product making false claims. That would make them more circumspect.Do companies have to spend on ads to survive? In theory, if the products being sold by different firms are identical in quality and consumers also think so, then it does not pay for any firm to spend on ads. Since the identical products would sell at the same price, the extra cost incurred on ads cannot be recovered.That is why we dont see ads for potatoes or tomatoes but find ads for different brands of potato chips and tomato ketchups (as these are not considered identical by consumers). At the other extreme, a monopolist  because he gets 100% market share by definition  cannot gain by spending on ads except when the ad helps expand the total market of the product by making more consumers aware of the product or an improved variety of the product or by enhancing the image of the company by advertising its CSR activities.Is so much spending on ad socially justified? Here a distinction needs to be made between ads to disseminate information and ads to take away sales from the competitors. The first type provides some useful service to the society. The second does not add any net social benefit. One firms gain is cancelled by another firms loss.While ads at tax payers expense aimed at changing social attitudes like open defecation, child marriage, demanding dowry etc are justified, wastage of national resources occurs when politicians use page-long ads to promote themselves under the pretext of informing the public about the laying of foundation stone for a project.If providing information is the objective, a simple press note in the media or a smaller ad without the names and photos of the numerous ministers and politicians should do.(The writer is former Professor of Economics, IIM-Calcutta)"

As per the recently published State Focus paper of Nabard, the entire produce which goes as waste has the potential for setting up of fruits and vegetable processing units.The major produce of the state, which is known as the fruit bowl of India, includes grapes, mangoes, pomegranates etc. The regions of Pune, Nashik, Satara Kolhapur, Sangli, etc are known for their extensive vegetable cultivation. Over all, the state has around 2 lakh hectares of vegetable cultivation. Nabards report says that about 70 per cent of fruits and 60 per cent of vegetables are consumed fresh in the state and hardly 1.2 per cent of fruits and vegetables are processed.Shriram Gadhve, president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India (VGAI), said the wastage of fruits and vegetables starts right from the field gate and continues till the retail market. Gadhve said that the lack of knowledge at the farmers end and the untrained market labours compound the wastage. Losses in transit are also encountered which often goes unaccounted for, he said. At the farmers end, Gadhve said, the lack of proper pricing hinders the adoption of proper handling techniques while at the market the labours employed are not trained properly in handling techniques.The usual practice for fruits and vegetable growers is to hire a vehicle to take their produce to the market from where it is unloaded and sold. Traders often cite lower prices to compensate for lower grade or wastage in the consignment. Gadhve said losses are more in case of soft vegetables like tomatoes and green leafy vegetables. The lack of storage or air-conditioned vans also contributed to the losses, he said.Gadhve said they had started awareness campaigns at the farmers end to educate them about proper handling and packing techniques. While this was welcomed by the farmers, the programme was difficult to scale up given the sheer magnitude of the work.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5928f0b87be9e0137c781bac,A pencil capsule with seeds to  grow saplings,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/603155/a-pencil-capsule-seeds-grow.html,2017-03-25,,Deccan Herald,"R Sathyanarayana in Chennai, March 26, 2017, DHNS 23:35 ISTMost schools in major cities are moving towards digitisation and expect children to use tablets to study. But ballpoint pen, pencil, eraser and notebooks continue to be part of their study. Students discard most materials after their academic year or when they are no more useable and go in for a new set.Now, thanks to the enterprising work by two computer science engineering graduates from Coimbatore district of Tamil Nadu, a pencil's stub can be grown into a sapling.S Ranjith Kumar and A Rajakamalesh had noticed that valuable pencil stubs were being thrown away. As pencils are biowaste, the duo started making efforts to effectively utilise them.The two have named their innovation Farmcil, a blend of farming and pencil. Farmcil, the name given to the pencil, grows into a plant, contributing to the preservation of ecology. The unique pencil has a capsule at one end containing seeds, Ranjith Kumar said.Ranjith Kumar said the name Farmcil for the pencil is to emphasise the importance of farming not only in the region but also throughout the nation and to preserve the green cover on earth.Ranjith Kumar said Our family and educational background were responsible for us to take up issues such as global warming and unbridled pollution, resulting in deteriorating quality of earth. These developments have been directly affecting people.In January 2016, we thought of working on this innovative idea. Thereafter, we started doing research on the project. We had detailed discussions with the professors in the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. It took a concrete shape in August 2016, Ranjith Kumar said.According to him, the wood used for the Farmcil is natural and free from any toxins since children tend to put the Farmcil in their mouths while writing. The capsule at the end of the pencil is made from non-toxic bio-material. Even if children chew the bottom of the Farmcil, it will not harm them. Once the Farmcil gets wet because of the saliva, it becomes sticky. Therefore, the child will not attempt to put the Farmcil in the mouth again, he said.The seeds in the Farmcil capsule are either of vegetables or flower-bearing plants. The seeds could be of tomato, brinjal, okra, chilli or cluster beans or verbena, zinnia, cockscomb, sunflower or balsam.Once the capsule dissolves, seed sprouts and grows into a plant. The process could take between three and 10 days, depending on the plant variety. The plant will yield flowers or vegetables in about 40 to 50 days.Students could use the Farmcil till it becomes short. Then, the remaining portion should be inserted sideways in the soil. Soil should be covered till planting mark. The Farmcil should not be planted deep inside. In addition, the soil in the pot should be loosely filled. After a few days, the capsule gets dissolved and begins to expose seeds. It is easy for a student to plant the Farmcil since it has the planting mark, Ranjith said.Sprouting depends on the seed. For example, tomato could take a week whereas for okra it could be just four days. Likewise, sprouting for chilli, brinjal, cluster beans and sun flower is between five days and one week. The student will have a choice of growing plant of his choice by buying the right Farmcil.Ranjith said that students would be thrilled to see plants with colourful flowers and green vegetables and they would have the satisfaction of nurturing them. Gardening slowly becomes a habit for children as they develop pride and sense of responsibility towards nature preservation, he said. The product is patented under the intellectual property rights law and the trade mark registration for this brand is under process.He said that Farmcil aims to drive home the importance of farming and ecology preservation. Also this concept inculcates the habit of nurturing nature in children when they start using Farmcils in their kindergarten classes, he pointed out. The habit is likely to stand children in good stead when they grow up.At present, the duo has started supplying the environmental-friendly Farmcils to various NGOs across Tamil Nadu. We have a product unit called R & R Trading Company that produces about 18,000 pencils per day, Ranjith said.In a bid to empower women, Ranjith's unit has employed only female staff in the packing section. We are in the process of introducing more vegetable and flower seeds. We have 10 types of seeds now, he said. The Farmcil is priced at Rs 10."
592943127be9e0138af8da12,"Tomato cultivation hit by demonetisation and infestation, price likely to spike",http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/tomato-cultivation-hit-by-demonetisation-and-infestation-price-likely-to-spike-4566023/,2017-03-11,,Indian Express,"Representational Image. Representational Image.This summer, tomato prices might see a spike as tomato plantations in Maharashtra have seen a sharp drop in output. Lack of ready cash with growers and an infestation of white flies is being attributed to the drop, which has affected the entire state. As against the 34,500 hectares of plantation used to cultivate tomato during summer, this year the state has seen 31,012 hectares of farmland used for the crop. The dip in area is significant in the tomato-growing districts of Pune, Nashik, Satara and Sangli.Watch What Else Is Making NewsDeepak Bhise, president of the Tomato Growers Federation of Narayangaon in Junnar taluka of Pune district, claimed that demonetisation was to be blamed for the dip in cultivation area as farmers didnt have enough cash. Tomato is a cash-intensive crop as farmers require costly inputs on an average, an acre of crop would require Rs 70,000 as input cost, he said.Currently, demonetisation and a sharp fall in prices of almost all farm produces have shaken the economics of rural areas, making farmers wary of heavy investments. Bhise, who normally plants five acres of tomatoes, has only planted three acres of the crop this year. Another reason for lesser cultivation is the apparent infestation of white flies in tomato-growing areas. Increase in onion acreage in the last few years has increased the prevalence of white flies in these areas. This pest destroys tomato crop, so many farmers have not opted for tomato this season, he said.According to traders at the wholesale markets, lesser agricultural area for tomatoes would result in an increase in the price of the vegetable in the days to come.In June last year, tomato prices had crossed the Rs 70 per kg mark in retail markets in many parts of the state, as a severe drought had destroyed the rabi crop. This year, lesser cultivation may also result in a spike in prices.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Express File Photo Indian Agricultural Research Institutes library building in New Delhi. Express File PhotoIn about a months time, Indian farmers are going to harvest their wheat crop that will mark the 50th year of the Green Revolution. The 1966-67 rabi season was when they first undertook large-scale planting of the new miracle high-yielding varieties on some 2,40,000 hectares. Key to the revolution was the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), whose scientists developed the package of practices for cultivation of the semi-dwarf wheat lines, initially imported from Mexico before breeding their own improved varieties, starting with Sonalika and Kalyan Sona in 1967. That very IARI today is without a regular director. It has, in fact, been without one for a good part of over two-and-a-half years. The last director to have served a full term,H S Gupta, retired on August 7, 2014. It took more than a year to appoint a successor. But even the new director Trilochan Mohapatra, who joined on August 28, 2015  he previously headed the Central Rice Research Institute at Cuttack, Odisha  was around for barely six months. On February 22, 2016, Mohapatra became director-general of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). IARI has been headless since then.It reflects the neglect by the authorities of an institution that has contributed so much to our farmers. That this is happening when we are celebrating the golden jubilee of the Green Revolution makes it even more unfortunate, says Vijay Pal Singh, former programme leader (rice) at IARI and breeder of Pusa-1121, the blockbuster basmati variety that generates around $3 billion in annual export revenues for the country.From Kalyan Sona and Sonalika in the mid-sixties, IARI scientists went on to develop similarly successful wheat varieties such as HD-2285 (released for commercial cultivation in 1982), HD-2329 (1985), HD-2967 (2011) and HD-3086 (2014). While Kalyan Sona and Sonalika raised the wheat yield potential that many farmers harvested from 10-15 quintals to 45-50 quintals per hectare, these rose further to over 70 quintals with HD-2967 and HD-3086. The last two varieties would cover an estimated 14 million hectares or nearly half of the total area planted to wheat in India this year!But wheat apart, IARIs research fields have produced a host of widely-cultivated varieties also in rice (Pusa Basmati-1, Pusa-44, Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509), mustard (Pusa Bold, Pusa Jaikisan, Pusa Mustard-25, 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30), chana (BG-256 and BG-362), vegetables (Pusa Ruby tomato, Pusa Purple Long brinjal and Pusa Sawani okra), and mango (Mallika and Amrapali). More recent breakthroughs include Pusa Double Zero Mustard-31 (the first ever canola-grade mustard containing low levels of erucic acid and glucosinolates) and Pusa Arhar-16 (a promising early-maturing pigeon-pea that can yield 20 quintals per hectare in just 120 days and is, moreover, amenable to mechanical combine harvesting).Significantly, all this is from an institution with an annual budget of just over Rs 400 crore, which also covers salaries and other establishment expenses. There arent many research organisations in India that have had such a tangible impact on the ground with so little investment, claims Singh, whose breeding accomplishments in basmati rice won him the Padma Shri award in 2012. IARIs bane has been the overbearing control  on everything from administration and appointments to funding, travel and research collaboration approvals  imposed by ministers, bureaucrats and scientist-administrators sitting in Krishi Bhawan. Such direct involvement from the Agriculture Ministry may not have mattered during the Green Revolution period, when the person at the helm, Chidambaram Subramaniam, was somebody who knew the subject well and, equally important, had a direct line with the then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi.We were living ship-to-mouth those days and everybody recognised the importance of investing in agricultural research. A lot of attention was, therefore, paid to institutions such as IARI and it continued even in the decades that followed. No wonder, we had such illustrious directors, be it B P Pal, M S Swaminathan, A B Joshi, H K Jain and S K Sinha or R B Singh and S Nagarajan, notes Singh.According to him, things have changed in the last few years, when agriculture itself has ceased to be a priority amongst policymakers and we think we have become self-sufficient. That has bred not just complacency, but even negligence, manifested in Indias premier national institute for agricultural research and education not having a full-time director. The Indian Agricultural Research Institute currently has Jeet Singh Sandhu, deputy director-general (crop science) of ICAR, holding additional charge as its director. Prior to him, the officiating director was Ravinder Kaur, an agricultural physicist who heads IARIs water technology centre.The director of IARI should be someone with a good understanding of soil and water, besides biochemistry, genetics and breeding, plant pathology and entomology. I hope the government make the right choice and it is done soon. The present situation is sending a negative message to the younger generation of scientists, adds Singh.Many eminent farm scientists, both past and serving, The Indian Express spoke to felt that the time had come to insulate both IARI and its parent organisation ICAR from political/bureaucratic interference by bringing them under the direct charge of the Prime Minister. This is the case with the Indian Space Research Organisation, Department of Atomic Energy, and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. Transferring administrative authority from Krishi Bhawan to the Prime Ministers office will make ICAR/IARI less vulnerable to ministerial whims and day-to-day interference. Moreover, it will help raise the profile of agricultural research to the level of space and atomic energy, while protecting the autonomy of institutions like IARI, they point out.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5935518e7be9e061b1736557,Silk Road to Goa,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/silk-road-to-goa/articleshow/58723848.cms,2017-05-18,,The Times Of India,"At the risk of losing out on a historic opportunity , India stands virtually alone in boycotting China's extraordinarily ambitious 'One Belt , One Road' (OBOR) logistics project to re-energize the millennia-old Silk Road's trading corridors, which once dominated global commerce. The Chinese plan is gargantuan and complex, with multiple linkages throughout Eurasia and across the Indian Ocean. There is a 'New Silk Road Economic Belt' of land connections and a 'Maritime Silk Road' comprising sea routes. It is the latter that holds particularly immense promise for Goa, if India conquers its doubts and joins the network.With OBOR, China's aspirations span the globe. Over 60 countries will be involved, committing the participation of two-thirds of the world's population, 55% of the global GDP and 75% of global energy reserves. Nine hundred infrastructure projects will come under this umbrella, involving at least $1.3 trillion in direct investment from state-controlled institutions led by Beijing. While several countries (including India) are wary of this forceful international push, seeing it as a bold Chinese initiative to rewrite the geo-strategic status quo, the Communist Party leadership has repeatedly declared its intentions are benign. President Xi Jinping says, ""What we hope to create is a big family of harmonious coexistence.""There are legitimate concerns for India that underlie its reluctance to embrace OBOR. Relations between the Modi and Xi administrations are poor and deteriorating. Beijing blocked India's bid to enter the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the crucial global cartel for nuclear trade. At the United Nations, China stymied India's latest attempt to sanction Masood Azhar of Jaish-e-Mohammed. Last month, the Dalai Lama was allowed to visit Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh, which the Chinese foreign ministry called ""severe damage on the China-India relationship.""Still, these minor irritants should not distract from the overwhelming historic logic for much closer ties between India and China. The two ancient civilizations flourished in harmonious contact with each other for thousands of years. Half-Kashmiri and half-Uighur scholar Kumarajiva revived Buddhism in China. During his service as national teacher under the 5th century emperor Yao Xing, 90% of the population converted to Buddhism. Throughout the intervening centuries, caravanserai from the Far East to Central Asia passed via India with goods to trade at every stop. The 14th century admiral Zheng He repeatedly travelled to India with his armada of the largest ships in the world.Goa has 'One Belt, One Road' logic embedded in its DNA. This insignificantly tiny riparian territory has nonetheless repeatedly stood centrepiece of a web of vital maritime connections. The Kadamba kings welcomed traders from across the Indian ocean and once appointed an Arab chief minister. Adil Shah's reign was even more cosmopolitan. Then, after 1510, Alfonso de Albuquerque's spectacular seizure of the entire sea routes of the Indian ocean comprehensively rewrote global economic history, with Goa as its most valuable hub.To the extent accurate historical analogies exist to China's OBOR, they come from the colonial past. British, French, Dutch and Portuguese empires all linked distant points of the globe together, with drastic and consequential results. At one point, it was accurately said ""the sun never sets on the British empire"" because so much of the world's territory was controlled from London. France also extended to South America and the South Pacific along with Africa and Asia. Before them all, however, it was the Portuguese who created the blueprint, and no spot on the planet better reflects the impact of global linkages than Goa.In social sciences, ""the law of unintended consequences"" predicts unforeseen developments and circumstances will blindside any purposeful action. This is what happened in the breakneck chaos of 16th century globalization. The tiny port city of Goa exploded to twice the population of London and Paris combined. In the area of food habits alone India transformed forever  chillies, corn, potatoes and tomatoes entered the subcontinent for the first time. And because roads run in both directions, the rest of the world transformed too  products, ideas and techniques flowed out from the subcontinent, from Goa, directly to Europe, to South East Asia and China, and all the way to Brazil. Within a short time, the Portuguese had lost control. Everything that followed was unpredictable and unplanned, and Goans benefited more than most.The 21st century's information age ensures fewer surprises lurk than during the Age of Discoveries. But the basic principles of increased openness remain. Everything flows in both directions. You cannot predict the winners, and it is also possible that everyone will win. This is the underlying message of Goa's history, with lasting value for every other part of the world. With all due caution, India must find a way to participate in China's hugely important revitalization of the ancient trade routes. They served the subcontinent very well for much of history, and can do so again.The writer is a photographer and widely published columnist. Views expressed are his own"

""Standing crops over fields in the current season include vegetables and fruits. Though most mangoes were already harvested in Konkan, there are several regions in the state that harvest mangoes in May and June. Mango crop in such places was damaged due to inclement weather,"" the official said.Crops that were damaged included tomatoes, onions, mangoes, grapes, banana and pomegranate. The official added that though banana and grapes were harvested in some places, several others had not harvested these fruits. ""It was mostly the strong winds that damaged the crops,"" the official said.Shriram Gadhave, president, All-India Vegetable Growers Association, said that crops over 10,000 acres in north Pune, particularly in blocks Junnar and Ambegaon, were damaged. ""Apart from onions rotting due to moisture and premature pomegranate fruits dropping off and getting spoilt, we had reports of harvested bajra on fields getting damaged due to inclement weather. Though rains have been quite less in May this year, it was the strong winds that caused all the fruit dropping and damage,"" said Gadhave.Amit Naphade, director, MAHA Farmers Producer Company Ltd (MAHAFPC), said that some farms in Vidarbha were still to harvest cotton. ""These were damaged, apart from crops like pomegranate and lemons. The rains and winds caused premature dropping of lemons from trees, which are bound to affect lemon produce in the coming two to three months. The upcoming months normally fetch a good price for lemons and growers rely much on the crop,"" he said."

With the harvest of shallots , like that of other vegetables, hit by the drought , the price of the vegetable has shot up by almost 150% in the past two months. With a kilo of shallots now costing almost Rs 100 per kg, households which used the vegetable generously are forced to rework their food budgets.Ironically, the price of big onions has been slowly but constantly dropping. Vegetable vendors attribute it to the arrival of excess stocks from Pune.Shallots, that is an essential part of many south Indian dishes like sambar, poriyal, bhajjis and other non-vegetarian dishes, used to cost as less as Rs 25 per kg three months ago; it now costs Rs 100 per kg. ""The price went up to Rs 40 in March. From then, it increased to Rs 70 by mid-April and Rs 90 in the beginning of May,"" said G A Wahab, secretary of the traders association and president of the Saibaba Colony Vegetable Vendors Association. ""The wholesale rate for the vegetable itself is Rs 90 per kg,"" he said. ""This is mainly due to a shortfall in supply of the vegetable. We don't know if farmers are hoarding it, or if there genuinely is such a big drop in harvest,"" he added.Shallot farmers admit there is a shortfall in the supply cycle, but attribute it to a combination of factors, including the drought and very low prices for the vegetable last year. ""Last year, shallots fetched hardly Rs 15 to Rs 20 per kg, and even that did not find buyers,"" said a farmer, T Kadhiresan. ""So, almost two-thirds of the shallot farmers opted to cultivate other vegetables like beans, spinach and tomato,"" he said. ""While that itself reduced the price, the drought like conditions and the climate reduced the yield by less than half,"" he said. ""Shallots need a lot of mist and no heat during its growing stages, but without that last year the yield dropped from the usual five tonnes an acre to two tonnes an acre,"" he added.With the prices likely to remain high, many housewives have begun reworking their budgets. ""I used to spend Rs 500 a week for vegetables, but now it has gone upto Rs 650,"" complained Aashrita Kanwal, a resident of Saibaba Colony. ""Besides this, I have also begun reducing my usage of shallots and am using onions instead,"" she said.That seems to be the way forward because onion prices have begun dropping. While the vegetable costs Rs 9 in the wholesale market, it costs Rs 12 to Rs 20 in the retail market. ""It has dropped by 0.50 p to Rs 2 per kg, because stocks from Pune have begun pouring in,"" said Wahab."

Naveen, who had expected to stumble upon a large herd of elephants in the course of his peregrinations through the forest, had been left disappointed, not having sighted even a single tusker on the first two days. However, on Friday - the last day of the census - his disappointment gave way to elation, when he spotted a herd of five elephants, which included a calf during the waterhole count.As part of the waterhole count conducted on the last day of the census, volunteers and resource personnel sit near a water hole, waiting for the elephants to assemble at the spot. While the sight of an elephant herd was a source of great delight for volunteers, Madappa M, a farmer of Hosa Birwalu village in HD Kote taluk, less than a kilometre from the park, watched them pass with trepidation. Madappa and members of his family fervently hope not to see any elephants, particularly near their field s where they have sown cotton.Madappa said that, the elephants trampled on the crops within two months of the seeds being sown. ""Elephants invading our fields is not new to us. But the problem has become serious over the years. They used to come into the fields once in a while, and feed on crops such as paddy and sugarcane. Lately, they don't spare any crops,"" Madappa added. Farmers living and working in villages on the periphery of Bandipur National Park share Madappa's concerns. As the three-day census operation came to an end on Friday, the threat that the tuskers posed to the livelihood of the farmers gave the volunteers much to ponder about. Tackling the humanelephant conflict has become a huge challenge for the forest department.While farmers in HD Kote taluk have traditionally cultivated paddy and sugarcane, they have started growing crops such as tomato, chilly, cauliflower and cotton in the recent years.Mallesha N of Badagalapura , another village lying close to the forest boundary, has tried several measures - from erecting a solar fence to changing the crop pattern -to keep elephants at bay. Blaming the forest department for its failure to restrict elephant movement, he said,""They don't allow us to graze our cattle inside the forest. They better keep the wild animals inside the woods."" Assistant conservator of forests for Hediyala sub-division that falls under Bandipur, Paramesh hoped that the forest department would be able to use the census data to combat the problem.""We're doing our best now.Trenches have been dug near the boundary, and night patrolling too has increased. We have also ensured farmers are compensated quickly for the crop loss. We're holding community meetings to increase awareness among villagers on the importance of wildlife,"" he added."

The ungodly hour on the second Sunday of May does not deter them from singing and sharing jokes as they prepare for one of Goa's quaint tribute to seafood and the tradition of fishing.Nerul is a small fishing hamlet famous for being surrounded by the Sinquerim river and the beautiful palm -fringed Coco beach. Situated opposite the state capital Panaji on the northern bank of River Mandovi, Nerul shares borders with the historic village of Verem-Reis Magos, where the famed Tisreachem Fest is also celebrated, albeit in a smaller way.Tisreachem Fest or the feast of clams is a community celebration that is held once a year at the tiny chapel of St Anthony in Bhattier vaddo of Nerul. Interestingly, the feast is also celebrated at Dandadi vaddo and Fortavaddo, indicating that the culinary celebration has nothing to do with a specific date.As the village wakes up, each home pulsates with activity. Residents scramble to open clams and prepare the ingredients as fast as possible so that the Sunday Eucharist at the Our Lady of Remedies Church is not missed.""There is no specific day for the feast and Tisreachem fest is not associated with any Christian or religious feast. There is no religious significance to it. It is just a chance for the community to come together,"" Nerul parish priest Fr Bolmax Fidelis Pereira says.While there is no religious significance behind the tradition, Nerul's idyllic surroundings have a lot to do with the feast. The nearby creek and the cove at the mouth of the River Mandovi was a thriving location for clams and mussels and the villagers, most of whom were fisherfolk, soon took to collecting the tisreos (clams), and shinaneo (mussels) and the village soon gained popularity in Bardez.Tisreos used to be collected in large numbers and distributedin the early days. ""This is a tradition that pre-dates the Portuguese rule. Nerul and Verem were known for a rich harvest of Tisreo and since the locals were mainly fishermen they decided to dedicate a day of thanksgiving for the abundance of tisreo,"" heritage activist and historian Prajal Sakhardande explains.Another unique facet of the Tisreachem Fest is that it showcases the communitarian and secular fabric of Goa. This age-old tradition, over centuries, continues to be celebrated with equal gusto by both Hindus and Christians.Once the Eucharist is over, the Catholics join their village brethren at a common place to continue the cooking. And cooking for Tisreachem Fest translates into the sambaracheo tisreo (a tasty delicacy prepared from tisreo) or tisreo xacuti.While the women busy themselves with large quantities of shellfish and coconut grating, the men chip in by chopping large quantities of onions, chillies and tomatoes. The kids are left to run errands or to purchase missed out ingredients.Apart from the few mansions and resorts built in Nerul, the village still retains its original charm, relatively untouched by modern tourism. There is still a strong fishing community and the villagers also grow watermelons, ground nut, rice and vegetables.""This feast is celebrated in other villages also, but not on as big a scale as in Nerul. It was started by the village forefathers and we continue this tradition. One of the reasons why this festival is celebrated in May is because many people used to come down to the coast for the summer and this became a celebration,"" Nerul sarpanch Shashikala Govekar explains.According to the local tradition, each feast has an appointed president in whose house the sambaracheo tisreo curry is prepared. Continuing the age-old tradition of giving thanks for God's blessings, the president or host of the feast offers the banquet of clams as a personal thanksgiving.""The feast has to be booked one-year in advance. The tradition of this feast has been going on for generations. In the olden days, the tisreo were served in bowls made out of banyan leaves, but we have switched over to ready made silver foil bowls. There is also a tradition of serving mangoes or jackfruit along with the tisreo,"" local resident David D'Souza, who hosted the Tisreachem Fest last May said."
593563097be9e061b17376cf,Why do we suffer acidity — heartburn and acid reflux,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/back2basics/why-do-we-suffer-acidity-heartburn-and-acid-reflux/,2017-05-16,,The Times Of India,"Many of us have suffered through symptoms of acidity and heartburn after a wedding celebration dinner or a late night party. We blame it on the spicy food, the fried stuff and the late night shenanigans. But we never seem to go down to the basics of understanding why till it becomes a frequently repetitive situation or gets so chronic that family members may have to rush you to the hospital suspecting a heart attack.Acidity occurs when the basic PH balance of our stomach remains acidic over larger periods of time, upsetting the tender linings of our stomach. In certain cases a stomach abnormality called hiatal hernia can cause acid reflux. This happens when the stomach acid is thrown back into the esophagus because of the partial closing or failing of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). If one is overweight then the diaphragm which is the muscle that separates your stomach from your chest is pushed upwards causing the LES to be stressed open.As we grow older, if one leads a sedentary lifestyle its not just your outer muscles but even the internal organs that slowly lose their tenacity and the LES can become weak as with the other sphincters and valves throughout your body.The stomach naturally produces HCl (Hydrochloric acid) to help with the digestion of food and has a higher acidic level than rest of the body (between to 2 to 5.5 as compared with 7.45 of rest of the body). The stomach also produces mucus at the same time which acts as a lining to protect its inner walls against the action of HCl.The HCl is required to kill bacteria that enters the body through food, and also to activate enzyme pepsin that helps in the breakdown of proteins in the stomach and the enzyme, Intrinsic factor that absorbs B12. Pepsin can only work in an acidic environment. If the food sits in the stomach for a longer period of time then the chances of increased acid levels can cause gases to be formed which in turn can result in bloating, burping, nausea, and heartburn due to acid reflux. Eating too much food can pressurize the stomach. Eating too high alkaline foods can cause more stomach acid to be produced to enable digestion, so balancing your meals are very important.Carbohydrates move quickly through the stomach, while proteins take longer and fats can sit in your stomach for almost 6 hours.While choosing your meals we should make sure we combine our food in such a way where we can get the maximum absorption of proteins while the carbs and fiber bind them while maintaining a good insulin balance. Fats should be preferably the unsaturated ones that go smoothly through the stomach till they are emulsified with bile in the small intestine to aid in absorption of the fat soluble vitamins, A,D,E and K.High alkaline foods are : Cabbage, broccoli, cucumber, avocado, spinach, kale, beets, celery, onion, tomato, garlic, carrot, almonds, coconut, pomegranate, olives, chickpeas, sprouted moong, soy.High acidic foods are : Meat (red meat as well as chicken, duck, turkey), eggs, Dairy (cheese, milk), oils, butter, cashews, peanuts, white rice, honey, jams, vinegar, mustard, cocoa, tea, coffee, alcohol, sweets, chocolate, fruit juices, and any food with preservatives.The rest of the foods fall into the medium category which we can incorporate into our everyday diets, in moderation ofcourse. However, it is very essential that when we have too much of either one of the high acidic or high alkaline foods we balance it with the other.Acidity should not be counteracted with anti acidity medicines over a prolonged time as they can inhibit your bodys absorption of essential nutrients. Make it a point therefore to eat well balanced, proportionate meals. Smaller meals that do not stay in the stomach too long, keep hydrating yourself in between the meals to make sure the stomach acids do not hurt the sensitive mucus linings of your inner walls.Eat before you are hungry and stop before you are full."

Data shows that almost 50% of the land in the district under fruits, spices, vegetables and flower cultivation is drip irrigated. In 2016-2017, 36,539 hectares of horticulture crops were cultivated in the district against cultivation on 39,000 hectares in the previous financial year. While the acreage under fruits, spices and flowers has come down in the district, the area under vegetable cultivation has actually increased by 600 hectares. So acreage wise, we do not see much of a difference from the previous year yet, said the deputy director of horticulture, A Ramakrishnan. But the cultivation this year has witnessed a noticeable drop when compared to that in 2014-2015 -when we had good rains, he said.While acreage under crops like banana, turmeric and tomato has fallen by 200 hectares to 300 hectares, area under onions has gone up. Banana and turmeric are long-term crops that require more water and so does tomato to give a good yield. Thus, many farmers have turned to vegetables like onions, chillies and ladys finger which are less fleshy and require less water, said Ramakrishnan.The area under plantation crops too has increased by 1,000 hectares, mainly because cocoa inter-crop plantations were also taken into ac count. Officials attribute the farm ers confidence to cultivate even in the face of such a severe drought, to drip irrigation. In the district, only farmers with assured water and ir rigation facilities bother cultivating their land. They stopped completely relying on rainfall many years ago, said Vasanthi Gnanasekharan, as sistant director of horticulture de partment, Thondamuthur block.In our district, if you remove the 15,000 hectares of plantation crops like tea, coffee, banana and cocoa from the equation, at least 50% of the remaining 21,000 hectares of cultivable land are drip irrigated, said Ramakrishnan. Drip irrigation becomes critical during drought situations, because with one large tank of water, we can add the required fertilizer and water almost five acres for four days, said A Veeramani, a chilly farm er in Madukkarai. In normal situa tions, the water stock would get over in a day or two, and will not cover the entire five acres, he said.The horticulture department now targets getting the entire area under fruit, vegetable and spice cultivation in the district under drip irrigation with in the next five years. We hope to achieve our targets within three years or maximum five years, said Ram akrishnan."

The thyroid gland located at the Adams Apple near your throat, is what produces hormones that activate cell activity by controlling your bodys temperature and the rate that your body burns calories.Our brain produces TSH (magnesium, B-12, zinc and protein are required to produce this) which travels to your thyroid gland and tells your thyroid gland to produce T4. (To produce that we need iodine Vitamin B5 and Vitamin C). Through the blood stream carries T4 and when it gets to the tissues it is converted into T3 (Selenium and glutathione is required for this conversion) which is the active form of thyroid hormone which gets inside of your cells nucleus to do all the work. The little tiny key hole on the surface of the cell is called the nuclear receptor where the thyroid hormone binds with the (This binding requires Vitamin A ad Vitamin D) which is what increases your metabolism.Hypothyroidism means too less of T4 and T3 being produced which will cause people to experience energy loss, weight gain, hair loss, dry skin, elevated cholesterol, constipation. So what are the foods that we can use to combat this situation in other words to facilitate the production of T4 and T3. Listed below are the best foods rich in the nutrients according to each particular task.The required intake of magnesium, B-12, zinc and protein can be got from;Dairy products such as milk, yogurt, curds, cheese etc Eggs Meat Pulses and Legumes Nuts and seedsThe required intake of Iodine can be got from;Wheatgrass Spirulina Seafood SaltThe required intake of Vitamin B5 and Vitamin C can be got from;Oats Tomatoes Potatoes Citrus fruits BroccoliThe required intake of Selenium and glutathione can be got from;Brazil nuts Milk FishThe required intake of Vitamin A and Vitamin D can be got from;Eggs Mushrooms FishMost of these are regular foods that we can easily incorporate into our daily diet. Including these foods might be the key to stabilizing the thyroid affecting your metabolism.Claims of goiterogenic vegetables of the Brassica family such as Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage and even greens such as spinach and kale, affecting the thyroid negatively are only based on conclusions that the goiterogens will block the absorption of iodine which is one of the key agents of optimum thyroid function. However one will have to eat them raw and in too large and amount for that to happen. Meanwhile if we give up on eating these veggies, we might be barring ourselves from getting lots more nutritional benefits. So, unless there is a specified clinical observation from your doctor dont disbar yourself from these veggies having high nutritional content.To re-activate your metabolism, you need to energize yourself with correct food intake and proper exercise. Smaller meals with consistent balance of carbs and protein, will help you reboot during the day. Divide your activity evenly during the day, so it keeps your food to energy conversion and carbs utility in a cycle. Remember that the key here is consistency, once the body gets used to the cycle, you will see a difference in your health too. Heal naturally."

Sarah Hafeez A row of vacant shops line the pavements. Sarah HafeezIn business for the last four decades, the Rajput Lohars of west Delhi have for the first time realised what it means to be in the midst of a slowdown. Their businesses are yet to recover from the demonetisation shock. This is the first time in the last 40 years that we have been waiting for a buyer before we can fix the next meal. We have never been in loss and we cant move to any other business because working iron is the only craft we have mastered since the age of 12, Jeet Kumar, an ironsmith from Rajasthans Chittorgarh, says, exactly three months after demonetisation was announced.Watch What Else is Making NewsEarthen hearths and anvils in the row of vacant-looking shops selling hammers, pick-axes, tongs, woks, sickles, pans, knives and an array of tools and parts line the pavements of Pankha road off the Tihar Jail complex.

This is because November and December saw everyone queuing up outside banks and forcing shops to stay shut, the ironsmiths said.We fear our business will never go back to the way it was. We are almost distress-selling. Our customers, most of whom are labourers or factory workers, just dont come.

5937b6727be9e015d564c98e,Note ban ‘most terrible’ decision of Modi Government: Chidambaram,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/note-ban-most-terrible-decision-of-modi-government-chidambaram/,2017-02-09,,Indian Express,"Congress leader and former Union Finance Minister P Chidambaram. (File photo) Congress leader and former Union Finance Minister P Chidambaram. (File photo)Opposition in Rajya Sabha today tore into the government for presenting a disappointing budget, with Congress leader P Chidambaram terming note ban as the most terrible decision and alleging that graft and black money have continued to thrive and large sections adversely affected. The former Finance Minister also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the words he chose to attack his predecessor Manmohan Singh, saying he should remember that the Chair he sat on was used by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and even Atal Bihari Vajpayee and hence he should use right language. Initiating the discussion on the 2017-18 General Budget, he accused the government of fumbling, bumbling, scrambling and inventing a new narrative every day. Observing that he saw his first Rs 2,000 note four days after it came into circulation, he said there were many who were caught with crores worth new notes stashed away. This is the biggest scam of 2016  Where did they get these notes from? Did these go directly from the RBI press to them, Chidambaram asked.This means that corruption and black money have thrived after demonetisation The NSSO says 15 crore people in this country are daily wage earners. 25.5 crore workers are daily income earners. 40 crore people were completely devastated by demonetisation for eight weeks. These 40 crore people may forgive you, but they wont forget the experience, he said.Questioning the remonetisation process, he asked why should you demonetise and then remonetise and said that the government has replenished Rs 9 lakh crore worth of new currency notes as against Rs 17 lakh crore old notes that went out of circulation.Chidambaram said the government had inherited an economy that, in the last two years of the UPA rule, had grown by 6.1 and 6.9 per cent respectively.The average for the 10-year period is 7.5 per cent. India is among the fastest growing large economies in the world. But through 2016-17, you made a series of mistakes, capped by the most terrible mistake, he said pointing at demonetisation.He also asked why was the government shying away from giving a GDP number even while giving an estimate.Terming the budget as a great disappointment, he estimated that 2016-17 will see a hit on GDP by 1-1.5 per cent and if very unlucky, then even 2 per cent and warned that this trend will spill over into 2017-18 also.In an economy that has admittedly slowed down, your Budget contracts government expenditure, Chidambaram said, adding that even in the budget, capital expenditure has been curtailed.You shifted money from defence research and added it to defence capital, he said, pointing to the allocation of Rs 86,484 crore and adding that if the money for research was subtracted, then the actual defence outlay will be much less.The Congress leader noted that the revised estimate came to over Rs 71,000 which meant that either you are unable to spend the money, or you dont have the money to spend.Allocation as a percentage of the GDP has only come down, Chidambaram said as he read out allocation figures of the last three budgets including that of 2016-17.To give a boost to the economy, we have to spend more. This is Economics 101, he said, adding that the economy will suffer because of contracted expenditure.He then spoke about the bull-taming sport of Jallikattu and said the protest over it in Tamil Nadu was only a symbol under which people converged. The most vocal angst is about jobs. There are simply no jobs being created and jobs have been taken away, he said, adding this is the angst that brought young people to the Marina (beach in Chennai).Quoting figures, the Congress leader said 75 per cent of all small and medium industries are closed and then went ahead to state that these figures were as per your (affiliate) trade union, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh.Everybody has different concerns. Some are concerned about intolerance  ban jeans, ban books, ban authors, ban beef We have to find jobs for both the uneducated and the educated, Chidambaram said.Addressing the ruling BJP members, he asked them to tell him one strategy in the Budget which will create jobs. On the contrary, you have destroyed jobs. This is a powder keg. All it requires is a spark. I would like to caution the government, he said.Speaking about farmers, he said the Minimum Support Price gave an indication that agriculture is a viable vocation and farmers should continue as the government was there to take care of them.But there is nothing in the Budget speech about MSP, he said adding that a wrong message was being sent to farmers.Why are you not giving meaningful increases that take note of inflation in your MSP? I am saying I need money to educate my child. I need money to start a small business for my son. I need money to conduct the marriage of my daughter.And you are giving me money to conduct my funeral. Is this the way to treat farmers of this country, he said referring to Fasal Bima Yojana.Observing that the government withdrew 86 per cent of currency overnight, Chidambaram spoke of a large number of ATMs still not functioning.He referred to a village in the national capital territoty which was declared as the first digital village in the region and said you go there and the people ask What digital? It is very difficult to get away with a lie. The best way to do so is to utter the biggest lie.Taking a dig at the government, Chidamabaram said RBI officials are busy counting the notes physically. You speak about digitisation. First, teach that to the RBI. Every rupee has come back, except in Bhutan, Nepal and NRIs, whose money cant come now, because you breached your promise to them.He also asked if Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes are the cause of such major ills, how does Rs 2,000 note put an end to it. If 10 per cent of bank officials were dishonest earlier, now youve made all bank officials dishonest.It has now become easier for people used to carrying briefcases of notes as they will have to carry a smaller brief case, he said wryly.Chidambaram gaves examples of countries which still uses cash including the US, Autralia and Austria.A young lady wants to buy lingerie. Why should there be a record? A young couple wants to take a secret holiday. Why should that be recorded? I want to give money to my daughter-in-law for her expenses without the knowledge of my son. Why should there be a record? An adult wants to buy adult diapers.Why should there be a record of that?There are serious issues of privacy are involved which are respected in any democracy, he said, adding that people cant be told to go to the village fair and buy potatoes and tomatoes for Rs 7.50 and use credit cards.Dont even try to defend demonetisation. At least spare us the ignominy of listening to this defence, he said.Maintaining that the budget has been a great disappointment, he said there is no overarching vision and goal. It has no strategy. By cutting expenditure, youve shown that your government has no empathy for the poor. Government must lean towards the poor. After all this, what have you achieved? You cant achieve your fiscal goal of 3 per cent. This Budget is a demonstrable failure of economic management.Talking about RBIs decision not to cut policy rate, Chidambaram said it shows the Budget has no credibility.RBI does not believe your numbers. The Governor has said they are moving from an accommodative position to a neutral position. He has no faith in the story that you are projecting. All bank chairpersons, who ordinarily sing the RBIs praises say there is no room to cut the lending rate. How will investment take place then? Capital is flowing out, investment intentions are declining, credit growth to industry is negative  how is your industry going to grow?For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Reuters) A worker holds an iceberg lettuce as he leaves a lettuce plantation in Pulpi, near Almeria, southeast Spain. (Source: Reuters)A shortage of iceberg lettuce is likely to continue into March, Spanish farmers say, because freak weather conditions in the south of the country early in the agricultural year prevented the planting of seedlings to replace ruined crops. The southern region of Murcia, where most Spanish lettuce grown for export is cultivated, suffered the worst floods in two decades followed by its first snow storm in over 30 years in December and January.Watch What Else Is Making NewsThis has been extraordinary, its not normal to have so many problems at once, said Jose Antonio Canovas, a farmer and salesman in Murcia for Kernel Export, which grows, packages and delivers a range of vegetables from cauliflower to broccoli.The ruined harvest and subsequent shortage of produce has led some British supermarkets like Tesco and Sainsbury to ration iceberg lettuces to three per visit. The limited supply follows a shortage of courgettes in Britain and supplies of broccoli and aubergines have also been affected.Vegetable production in the European Union has fallen to 60 percent of normal levels in recent weeks due to bad weather affecting producers across the Mediterranean, from Greece to Spain, Spanish exporters say. Spain accounts for around half of EU vegetable exports.Not only did floods and snow ruin crops, leaving lettuces ready for harvest withered and battered in the fields, but the bad weather prevented the planting of polytunnel-grown seedlings which meant more delays to the next harvest of Spains biggest fruit and vegetable export after tomatoes.We have notified our customers that there may be production delays in March because the planting of seedlings has been delayed and in the rush to supply the market some crops were picked ahead of time, said Fernando Gomez, general manager of The Murcian Federation of Producers and Exporters of Fruit and Vegetables (Proexport).The production of lettuces, one of the most badly affected crops, has fallen by up to a third in the peak winter months of production when Spain harvests over 100,000 tonnes of the 700,000 tonnes it exports annually.Production is likely to return to normal by the end of March or the beginning of April, Proexports Gomez said.Many farmers in the area do not insure their crops. In a sector with very slim profit margins of between 1.5 and 4 percent, profit relies on big volumes. Higher prices have not made up for the losses farmers have suffered.Alongside the hit from ruined crops, the hiring of specialised labour to work the flooded and frozen fields has also eaten into profit margins at farms.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

The district administration had clamped night curfew in Silapathar on Wednesday, which was made indefinite from Friday after six shops were set ablaze in the heart of the town. On March 6, members and supporters of Nikhil Bharat Bangali Udbastu Samanway Samitee (Nibbuss) attacked the All Assam Students' Union (AASU) office, with a ripple effect. Normalcy is yet to return. The administration had yesterday relaxed curfew for two hours to let people buy essential commodities, whose scarcity was such that tomato was being sold at Rs 50 per kg. As no fresh incident was reported last night, the administration decided to relax curfew from 11am to 3pm today to enable people to enjoy Holi. For a few hours residents of the town immersed in the spirit of Holi by smearing colours on each other. ""It looks like Holi has brought victory over evil. We are enjoying the occasion to the fullest,"" said Chand Ratan Chandak, a resident. ""We are happy to enjoy Holi although it is for a very short time. We are also praying for the return of peace in the town,"" said Shankar Mech. The agitating organisations, in a meeting yesterday, decided to let businessmen open their establishments, barring the 143 shops that had downed shutters reportedly to attend the meeting organised by Nibbuss. The organisations also decided to request the businessmen to stay away from anti-Assamese activities. Today, most of the shops in the market were open. They were thronged by many as people could not buy essential items yesterday. In another breakthrough, based on information provided by Bengali organisations, Dhemaji police and the army arrested Nibbuss's national organising secretary Binoy Biswas, 54, at 2.30am today from Dharmapur village, 25km from Silapathar. Biswas was found in the house of Sorbeswar Das, 45, who was also arrested. Biswas, who hails from Natun Birpur under Betua Dohori police station in West Bengal, has identified himself as an advocate of Calcutta High Court. He was one among the 21 people against whom AASU had lodged an FIR at Silapathar police station. Sanjay Das, the Dhemaji district general secretary of Nibbuss, was also arrested today. With this, the total number of arrested persons in connection with the March 6 attack has gone up to 43 while the number of persons detained for violating curfew has gone up to 111. The Dhemaji district unit of AASU today declared March 6 as a ""black day"" for Assam and the Assamese community. It said the ""failure"" of the state government to arrest Subodh Biswas, the ""main accused"", has created suspicion among them that the government was deliberately not arresting Biswas for fear that it would reveal his alleged links with the BJP and RSS. Additional director-general of Assam police Mukesh Agarwal, who is monitoring the situation, told The Telegraph: ""The situation is under control now. Today, we relaxed curfew for four hours.

Also, it has been decided to purchase moong and toor pulses at Rs 5,500 and Rs 5,050 per quintal.While the RSS-affiliated Bhartiya Kisan Sangh had called off the stir following a meeting with the CM on Sunday, other bodies like Bhartiya Kisan Union and Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh are yet to call of the 10-day long protest.Why are the two states facing trouble?Farmers from the drought-hit states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh have taken to the streets in the last few days.

But a section of farmers outfits is not happy and want loans of all 1.34 crore farmers in the state to be written off. The demand is supported by Opposition parties and the BJPs main ally, the Shiv Sena. Significantly, two influential farmers outfits, the late Sharad Joshi-founded Shetkari Sanghatana and MP Raju Shetti-led Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, have decided to jump into the agitation. Shetti is an ally of the BJP. A 21-member core committee of prominent farmers leaders in the state has been formed, which will be meeting on June 8 in Nashik to decide on a future course of the agitation.Anticipating trouble and in the backdrop of the violence in neighbouring MP on a same issue, the state governments orders that prohibit five or more people from assembling at a spot will remain in effect till June 16 in Pune, June 17 in Kolhapur and June 19 in Nashik.In Mumbai, the vegetable markets received regular supply and prices stablised on Tuesday. The rates of tomato dipped to Rs40 a dozen, while cauliflower was priced at Rs 60 a kilogram. Fruits like chikoo dipped to Rs40 a dozen from Rs120 a dozen when the strike was at its peak on Friday.In a significant development, NCP chief Sharad Pawar called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi apparently to seek his attention to the farmers agitation in Maharashtra. According to reports, Modi told Pawar that Fadnavis would take a call on loan waiver.Significantly, state governments hopes to get any assistance from the Centre to write off farmers loans suffered a setback as union urban development minister M Venkaiah Naidu, who was in Mumbai on Tuesday, categorically ruled out any loan waiver package or aid by the Centre to the state for the purpose. Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have announced loan waivers on their own and Maharashtra will have to follow the same, Naidu told reporters.In the backdrop of the agitations, Fadnavis met BJPs ministers late on Tuesday. The meeting was held to review the BJPs recently undertaken farmer outreach campaign Shivar Samwad (Dialogue with Farmers) across nearly 43,000 villages in Maharashtra, at his official residence Varsha. The review comes ahead of party president Amit Shahs visit to Maharashtra as a part of his all India 95-day campaign tour to review organisational strengths of the BJP across all states, on June 16, 17 and 18."

It has been the second year of a bumper onion crop with no buyers, forcing the government to announce a belated decision to procure the onions for Rs 8 per kilogram.Farmers are angry because the government neither made arrangements to procure the crop on time nor intervened to ensure a reasonable price. They threw onions on roads given the prices of the vegetables plummeted to as low as Re 1 to Rs 2 per kg in certain markets, especially in the Malwa region, last year. This year too, farmers had to sell their winter crop  tomato and potato  at throwaway prices, bearing heavy loss.The distress is visible in the suicide numbers. From February 2016 to mid-February 2017, 1,982 farmers and farm labourers reportedly committed suicide, which was one-fifth of the total suicides in the state, where 21,000 farmers have taken their lives in 16 years.The National Crime Records Bureau attributed the reasons to crop failure, failure to sell produce, inability to repay loans, and other non-agriculture factors such as poverty and property disputes.The farmers should have been affluent if 20% growth figure given by the government is to be believed, said former state agriculture director GS Kaushal. But, he said, the reality was that input costs were rising and government failed to ensure remunerative price.MP farmer agitation: How the crisis unfolded June 1: Farmers begin a ten-day-long agitation in Madhya Pradesh demanding better price for their produce June 4: Clashes break out between police and farmers in Sehore, Indore and Bhopal districts, leaving six policemen injured June 4 afternoon: A delegation of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), which is affiliated to saffron parivar, defers farmers agitation following a meeting with chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in Ujjain June 4 evening: Enraged by the announcement of BKS, other two major organisations spearheading the agitation - Rashtriya Kissan Mazdoor Sangh and Bharatiya Kisan Union - say agitation had not been called off or deferred.

Experts say crop failure rate in the rain-fed regions is high.The state governments zero percent interest loan benefitted some farmers. But farmers in general were not able to claim benefits again as they were not able to repay the short-term loan. This, local government officials say, pushed farmers to local money-lenders, a reason for farmers to demand loan waiver.The governments bid to improve horticulture and food processing is mainly confined to paper, leading to farmers not getting benefits, much like farm owners in Punjab and Haryana."

Telegraph picture Ranchi, March 21: The state government has said it would build 14 cold storages in all in various districts, the announcement likely to please Jharkhand's farmers who had to sell tomatoes at throwaway prices and even dump their produce on highways to protest against poor prices. ""The government will build 14 cold storages in various districts,"" agriculture minister Randhir Kumar Singh said at a news conference at Nepal House, adding that four of these had been announced last year. He said the government would also set up five agriculture colleges. These would train as many as 260 students in the first year in various agri disciplines, and start functioning from the next academic session (2017-18). Singh said tenders had already been floated for the four cold storages, each of 5,000 metric tonne capacity, announced last year. ""These will come up in Ranchi, Gumla, Giridih and Deoghar districts,"" he said and expressed the hope that these would become functional by the end of 2018. This year, chief minister Raghubar Das had announced the construction of 10 cold storages in his budget speech, the minister reminded the media, and said that work on these would begin soon. ""These cold storages, with 5,000 metric tonne capacity each, would be constructed in the districts of Simdega, Lohardaga, Bokaro, Chatra, East Singhbhum, West Singhbhum, Palamau, Garhwa, Godda and Sahebganj,"" he said. Singh explained that all the cold storages would be run by local cooperative societies under the supervision of Vegfed (Jharkhand State Adivasi Cooperative Vegtable Marketing Federation) and profit would be shared between them on a 50-50 basis. ""Five agriculture colleges would also start functioning from the next academic session,"" the minister announced, adding that these would be coming up at Garhwa, Godda, Deoghar, Hansdiha (Dumka) and Gumla. They will all be affiliated to Birsa Agriculture University (BAU) of Ranchi. While the colleges at Garhwa, Godda and Deoghar, each with 60 seats in the first year, would offer agriculture courses, those at Hansdiha and Gumla, with 40 seats each, would train students in dairy development and fisheries respectively, he said. Singh said that initially, it was proposed that the colleges would be run on PPP mode as the infrastructure for all was ready. ""But later the government decided to run them on its own under BAU, which would be the best option,"" he felt."

Before the embargo, Turkey had supplied around a half of the tomatoes consumed in Russia.""We have secured serious developments on all issues outside of tomatoes. We have shared our sensitivities on the tomato issue,"" Yildirim said.Admitting the tomato had now become a ""symbol"", he added: ""Regarding the tomato, we need more time.""Russia is keen to promote its own production of tomatoes as its seeks to diversify its hydrocarbon-based economy and develop agriculture.Quoted by Russian media, Medvedev said that the ban on Turkish tomato imports would stay in place, although all other restrictions on fruit and vegetable imports had been lifted.He said tomatoes were not included as Russia wanted to ""preserve investments made in the sector that should not come to nothing.""The November 24, 2015 shooting down of the Russian plane led to an unprecedented crisis in ties and prompted Russia to impose a raft of sanctions against Ankara.These included an effective ban on Russian package holidays to Turkey, ruining the 2016 tourism season in the country's south. That ban has since been lifted.After a reconciliation deal last year, relations have seen a rapid improvement with the two sides working together in a bid to end the Syria conflict.Erdogan had invited President Vladimir Putin to the Istanbul Black Sea summit, during a visit to Russia earlier this month.

It is better if they resort to a peaceful way of protest,"" Hazare told reporters.The Gandhian's appeal for peaceful protest came against the backdrop of farmers' agitation turning violent in some parts of the state with incidents of stone pelting and vandalising of vehicles carrying milk and vegetables to Mumbai being reported on Wednesday night.Appealing to farmers to shun violence, Hazare said he was ready to join discussions between the farmers' leaders and Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis if he was asked to.Yesterday, Fadnavis expressed willingness to hold talks with the agitating farmers.""'Satyagraha' is a birthright of all. The government should not use police force when there is a peaceful agitation,"" he said.The septuagenarian alleged that farmers have resorted to protests due to ""anti-farmer"" policies of the government.""Farmers must get an assurance on price of their agricultural produce based on expenses incurred by them on production. This demand has always been neglected by all the past governments,"" the anti-graft crusader said.A non-political movement of farmers is necessary to pressurise the whole political system to meet the demands of farmers, he said.""If farmers' leaders wish so, I am ready to initiate a dialogue with farmers and the government,"" Hazare said.However, farmers in Nashik district hit back at Hazare over his appeal for peaceful protests.Speaking to a regional television channel, Ramesh Chougule, a farmer from Nashik said, ""When farmers were committing suicides, Anna never uttered a word for the families of those farmers. ""Therefore, now when they are protesting for their rights, he should not interfere. What is wrong in asking for our rights of getting better returns for our produce.""Ravindra Bhasme, another farmer from Satana tehsil in Nashik said, ""I am a part of farmers' group and we produce leafy vegetables and fruit vegetables to supply to Mumbai.""We have decided not to harvest it and support the strike. We will not send our vegetables to Mumbai so that the government will feel the heat.""He also said that the social activist had been selective when it came to farmers' issues. ""Hazare should have been with us from the beginning,"" he added.Farmers from many parts of the state including Nashik, Pune and Ahmednagar districts have joined the stir, which entered the second day today.The agitation is mainly spearheaded by farmers' activists though parties like the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna, led by Raju Shetti, an ally of the ruling BJP, have extended moral support to the stir. Among the demands raised by agitating farmers are waiving loans owing to crop failures and indebtedness, besides ensuring a guaranteed minimum support price (MSP) for their produce. Farmers in Nashik district are opposing acquisition of land for the proposed Super Communication Expressway connecting Mumbai and Nagpur.A curfew was imposed in Yeola town of Nashik district yesterday, following a clash between the police and a mob of stone pelters.At Lasalgaon in Nashik district, protesters stoned a police jeep, damaging its windshields.

Swaminathan Committee recommendations.Mumbai, the country's biggest city with a population of around 17 million, gets around 160 tonnes of vegetables from only Nashik daily, besides other parts of Maharashtra, which started declining from early today, leading to a 20-30 per cent hike in retail prices."

Picture by Amit Gupta Ranchi, Jan. 15: This Tusu, the madal beats softly. The height of chaurals, bamboo structures worshipped as symbols of prosperity, is short. Tusu, mostly celebrated in Chotanagpur and Kolhan regions by tribal and non-tribal agrarian community after paddy harvest from January 14 (Makar Sankranti) to January 25, is low in spirits this year, as farmers are short of cash. In the wake of cash crunch after demonetisation, farmers sold paddy and vegetables at abysmally low rates. Now, they don't have purchasing power to celebrate Tusu in style. Farmers sold tomatoes for Rs 2-3 per kilo and paddy for Rs 10-11 per kilo at rural haats. Budhan Singh Munda, mukhiya of Tamar in Ranchi district, which falls in south Chotanagpur region, said as much. ""There was surplus production. But, farmers had to sell their produce for peanuts as no one was ready to pay the minimum support price. Where's the money to celebrate the festival lavishly? Only bare minimum rituals are being followed,"" he said. A schoolteacher of Tamar, Ajay Kumar, said for residents it spelt some cheer as paddy and vegetables cost less in the ripple effect of demonetisation. ""But, farmers are suffering, as low-key Tusu celebrations point out,"" he said. Tusu-related businesses are also suffering. Govardhan Munda, who specialises in making chaurals, did brisk business till last year, selling around 50 bamboo structures. This year, he sold 10. ""Budgets are less,"" he rued. The price of chaurals start from Rs 500 and can go up to Rs 10,000 depending on height and decorations as they appear in various rural competitions, he said. ""But this year, buyers looked for shorter and less gaudy chaurals,"" he said. People are also cutting down on jaggery, a traditional sweetener for Tusu delicacies like pitha. Jaggery comes for Rs 35 to Rs 40 a kilo. Jaggery seller Gautam Haldar said he lost around 50 per cent business this year. ""In other years, we used to sell truckloads of jaggery during December-January. This year, our sale is almost half,"" he said. Tusu is an integral part of Chotanagpur and Kolhan districts, Ranchi, Khunti, Seraikela-Kharsawan, twin Singhbhums, among others. Festivities start with the ritual bath in rivers on Makar Sankranti."

The total production is estimated at 295 million tonnes, 3.2% higher than in 2015-16.The estimate shows that 2016-17 will be the fifth straight year when India's horticulture production will outstrip that of foodgrains. The foodgrain production for 2016-17 is estimated at 273.38 million tonnes.The agriculture ministry released on Tuesday the second advance estimate for horticulture production, noting that even the area under horticulture crops had recorded an increase  from 245 lakh hectares in 2015-16 to 249 lakh hectares in 2016-17. The second advance estimate has, in fact, revised the production figure upward from the first, which had put the figure at 287 million tonnes in February. The higher production this year is attributed to a good monsoon in 2016.According to the ministry's estimate, based on information provided by states and Union territories, fruit production for 2016-17 is estimated at 93 million tonnes, 2.9% higher than the previous year, and vegetable yield at 175 million tonnes, 3.5% higher than the 2015-16 production.Most vegetables, including onions, potatoes and tomatoes, will record an increased production this year.

The strike has adversely affected supplies of vegetables and milk to wholesale markets across the state and led to an increase in prices.On Saturday, the state government announced a farm loan waiver of Rs 30,000 crore, the biggest such write-off for farmers in the state yet.

His audience, a group of college students, listens closely.On the far side of the cafe, two women sit together picking at potato wedges and making awkward first-date small talk.Anywhere else, they would have looked incongruous, but at Chez Jerome  Q, said to be Delhis first LGBTQ cafe, no one blinks an eye. The so-called abnormal is normal here, and judgment is meant to be left at the door.Since Chez Jerome opened, its hosted speed dating events for straight and queer couples, ladies and trans mens nights, discussions about LGBTQ issues, and meetings with queer artistes.Waiters swish by, taking orders and placing empty glasses on a counter over which a large rainbow flag is draped. Behind the counter, on the door of the bathroom, the usual stick figure of a man or a woman has been replaced by a figure thats half-man, half-woman. It is labelled WE DONT CARE.The sun sets and all of a sudden theres music. The Qutub Minar glows in the night sky. The students break into dance. One of the young men is wearing a long embroidered purple skirt. A glittering rhinestone necklace peeks out from below the collar of another boys checked shirt. A huge neon green turban is perched precariously on the head of a young woman. They sway joyously, unselfconsciously to the beats of megahit Hindi pop song Kala Chashma.A man with a big tray of drinks and a bigger smile ambles towards the customers, takes their orders, and introduces himself. His name is Sambhav Dehlavi and he is owner, head chef and matre d all rolled into one. If you seem to want company, hell sit down with you, share a cigarette and tell you how he set up Chez Jerome last year to create a safe public space for the LGBTQ community.Are there not already places in Delhi where queer people can hold hands or dress the way they want? Theres difference between being tolerated and being welcomed, Dehlavi says, between feeling like an outsider and feeling at home.When you enter, you realise that youre free here, says 18-year-old Nitish Anand, who defines himself as gender-fluid and asexual. Your choices of being different are okay.Pulkit Sharma, a 19-year-old Delhi University student who identifies as queer, says the cafe serves as a safe haven and represents a giant leap for the city.Its an idea that took shape as Dehlavi backpacked across Europe a few years ago and worked as a chef to pay his way. Every city he visited boasted a vibrant queer culture with at least one public space for the community.In India, where sex between people of the same gender is outlawed and where queerness is normally shunned, Dehlavi feels the need for spaces such as Chez Jerome is even greater.He is quick to point out that exclusion is not his aim. I want this to be a safe space for women, too, Dehlavi says, for anyone who wants to be part of an inclusive culture.A version of the Spanish pincho, strips of meat and potato tied to garlic bread and topped with cherry tomatoes. (Facebook/ Chez Jerome - Q Caf)Even Dehlavis menu is a study in unconventionality. Its a free-wheeling assortment of foods from across Europe: Frances famous croque monsieur; a version of the Spanish pincho, strips of meat and potato tied to garlic bread and topped with cherry tomatoes; Greek omelettes with feta cheese, baby spinach leaves and chopped red onions; and a white Italian pizza with Dehlavis personal twist  a layer of potato chips and cream cheese.And theres more left off the menu that Dehlavi will whip up for you if you fall into conversation with him. Like its customers, Chez Jerome offers more than meets the eye."

Express Photo by Dasarath Deka Gokul, Bipul, Kailash, Phanindra, Narayan and Bubul in Nalbari. Express Photo by Dasarath DekaTILL ABOUT a decade ago, Nalbari district, 80 km from Guwahati, was the home of leaders and hundreds of cadres of the outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA). Today, many of the young men here have rejected the gun and picked up the plough.Watch What Else Is Making NewsThe change started around six years ago when six friends got together, convinced 42 families in their village to lease them small parcels of land and decided that agriculture was the way forward.We tried looking for government jobs but realised that we had to pay bribes. Private companies dont pay much, anyway. Thats when we decided to set up Sankardev Joibik Krishi Paam in 2011, says Bipul Haloi, 42, one of those six and a former temporary teacher who lost his job.We cleared about 40 bighas of land in 2012 and began to cultivate potatoes, cabbages and pumpkin. We worked hard and at the end of the year, earned about Rs 3 lakh, says Bipul.Now, their land base has increased to 300 bighas, with help from the Mariadanga Namghar Samiti, the local prayer hall committee; they have 25 labourers working for them; and, they cultivate pumpkin, gourd, cucumber, beans, cabbage, cauliflower, brinjal, tomato, potato, banana, guavas, mangoes, lemon and litchi.In 2016, just the pumpkins that we grew on 150 bighas fetched us over Rs 17 lakh, and gourds about Rs 1.4 lakh, says Phanindra Haloi, 36.Phanindra, who has completed Class XII, quit a temporary job at a private firm in Guwahati to take up farming. Other members of the group have similar stories: Bubul Haloi, 37, worked for three years in a bookstore in Guwahati; Narayan Haloi, 40, was a mason; Gokul Haloi, 30; worked as a newspaper hawker in Nalbari town; and Kailash Haloi, 32, was employed on a casual basis at a nursing home.Last month, the government horticulture department provided them 1,000 saplings of strawberry, and a supermarket in Guwahati had promised to buy the entire produce.What is most important is that everything we grow is 100 per cent organic. The floods that occur here often have deposited a thick layer of alluvium, and the land we took up had been unused for years, making it fertile. We dont use chemical fertilisers, either. We buy cowdung from the villagers, and the agriculture department has set up a compost unit, says Narayan.We do not have any problem selling our produce, too. Wholesale agents come from Guwahati, Shillong and Aizawl to take our vegetables. In 2016, three truckloads of pumpkins, weighing about 45 tonnes, were exported to Bangladesh. We plan to set up a marketing team or promote local youth to take to marketing so that the benefits remain within our district, says Bipul, adding that they also provide additional income to at least 30 households who supply cowdung.Nalbari has a high unemployment rate, with the latest Assam Human Development Report putting it at 9.4% against the state average of 8.1. And, many of these unemployed youth are high school drop-outs. This group of six has become a kind of role model. Now, at least half-a-dozen such groups have come up along the Pagladiya river in Nalbari in the last two years. These farmers are educated, have access to information and are hard-working, says Bangshidhar Kalita, programme officer for organic farming in the Assam agriculture department.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Jadhavs dont feel tension. Mother Mandakini brushes off all talk of anxiety in the stands where the family sat, watching son Kedar, play his part in Indias epic chase of 351 against England late on Sunday. We know our boys ability. And you know how great Virat Kohli is. Bas, mag kaay tension? says the wiry lady, sitting ramrod straight with a sparkle in her eyes on an easy couch at their flat, wearing one of her favourite green saris as mediapersons troop in and out of the drawing room of the Jadhav house.The Jadhavs are part of a strictly middle-class neighbourhood off Paud Road in Pune  theres a girni (flour mill) around the corner, the clean pathway leading upto the four-storey apartment (where Jadhavs own two adjoining flats on one floor) is lined with trees and two wheelers alike.

Black saris and finery in tow, with the traditional til-gul (a soft sesame-jaggery sweet) exchange planned as a family reunion, the sisters met Kedar the day before the match, as the youngest son dropped by for the annual ritual. We never talk about cricket a day before his matches, and hes also very relaxed.Nothing fazes him, says sister Sucheta. Our father always had leadership qualities and has a confident personality. Every single person in the family is capable of handling biggest problems and weve always faced challenges headlong. All these qualities have trickled down into Kedar, she says.The excitement was palpable at the Jadhav household in Pune. The excitement was palpable at the Jadhav household in Pune.Father MS Jadhav retired from MSEB in 2003  a year before Kedar debuted in Ranji Trophy, and the family was happy that the four children had between them a English Literature PhD, an engineer, a Finance MBA and finally a sportsman.I used to wonder initially how come a good boy like Kedar drifted towards cricket, the father quips, before hes drowned out by protestations of the sisters and the mother. He never liked studies much, and he was always good at cricket. The good thing was though he would disappear for hours on end to play, he would always tell us where he was going. No sneaking away, no secrets, says eldest sister Charusheela.A 80m long rectangular pebble strewn playground  with a neat joggers walkway around it in the adjoining Lokmanya Nagar was where Kedar started his cricket. Its called the Jeet ground, though the original three-storey Jeet building facing the ground after which the tiny maidan took its name was razed down for redevelopment. Thats where the tennis ball cricket started. He would announce hed hit a big six and the ball would sail into the Jeet building terrace next ball, Sucheta recalls.ALSO READ | Kedar Jadhav: Tennis ball legend who hit an aceAll his katta friends ended up with strong arms and weary shoulders as he would make them bowl to him for hours. And he picked up his first nickname in the neighbourhood. They called him mini Sehwag, and he liked the name so he would tell people he is Mini Sehwag. There was never a shortage on confidence.The years spent waiting in the wings  he is 31 now  werent full of angst or frustration. Ive never seen him sad about not being selected for India when he was younger. He had great patience, even during those Ranji seasons when he wasnt consistent. He is so sure of himself that we werent surprised that he would make good the chances he got, says sister Sucheta. While hed vroom away on his Yamaha  the kit-bag getting drenched every monsoon on his long trips to Cadence Academy, the family decided to buy him his first car for purely utility reasons.A close knit family, Kedhar Jadhav never grew up as a spendthrift  though he was the baby of the family and much adored  and would hand his earnings to the family, and like in his childhood, borrow a minimal Rs 1,000 from his dad when he stepped out. Jadhavs known for his love for clothes, sunglasses and belts. He is also famous for his Salman Khan fandom since his teen days. It wasnt just how he celebrated his maiden ton in Zimbabwe  with the Dabangg hook step  its also his insistence on watching Khans films first day-first show in movie-mad Pune.Like father, like daughterThe star of the family though is one-and-half- year old daughter Miraya, whos inherited an uncanny love for dancing from father Kedar. She can watch Salman on TV and start dancing to the exact steps, though shes barely started talking. She dances to Jag Ghumeya though shed just learning the words, says aunt Sucheta.Wife Snehal and mother Mandakini  whos a little frail and was unsure of whether she could be at the stadium for 7-hour stretch  were not scheduled to travel, but the mother decided on a whim and then both baby and grandmum were packed up in woollens into the car to watch their first international.He loves stuffed brinjal and a tomato chutney, but I couldnt make it this time he came, his mother says, recalling how hed gorged on it after making a 327 in Ranji Trophy after beating Mumbai last season. On Sunday, he chomped on the Englishmen instead. We know his ability. It was great to hear people in stadium say with confidence that he would be Man of the Match, his mother says. She never had any doubts.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"
593bc9387be9e04956d788b6,Worth going ‘Fidahh’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/worth-going-fidahh/article18587550.ece,2017-05-27,,The Hindu,"As Iran elected its president, I was reminded of a band of young Iranian friends I had way back in time. In those days when Jawaharlal Nehru University was where all rebels gathered  though I cant say it has changed much since then, despite all efforts to tame it  they studied in JNU and were greatly critical of the Shah of Iran. As Hassan Rouhani was re-elected, I thought of them, wondered where they were, and decided that we would have an Iranian meal in their memory.So I trotted off to the Food Court in the Nehru Place Metro Terminal, in search of an eatery called Fidahh, where I heard you get good Iranian food. I went there and found that the food is essentially Lebanese (of course, theres a shared culinary heritage in the region), but there are quite a few Iranian dishes, too. There is, for instance, something called jujeh kabab, spiced chicken kababs served with rice and a dip.This is a food court, so you order your dishes and eat at a table at the centre of the court, which has a large sitting area. I asked for some lamb chelo kabab (Rs. 340), which I have often eaten in a restaurant called Peter Cat in Kolkata, a chicken shawarma roll (Rs. 219) and, hoping to be healthy, a fattoush salad (Rs. 185). The chelo kabab was to have come with a bed of rice, a red chilli dip and warm pita bread. There was no pita bread  warm or otherwise  but the kabab was excellent, as was the long grained rice, mildly sweet and spiced.I enjoyed the salad, a mix of lettuce leaves, tomatoes, cucumbers and onions, flavoured with zaatar, a mix of spices often used in the region which lends a tart taste to a dish, mint, olive oil, lemon juice and sumac (a much used herb). This was to have been served with crispy pita bread, but I dont think it was my day for bread, for there was no pita with my salad.Deliciously crunchyWhat I really enjoyed was the chicken shawarma, a roll of chicken and iceberg lettuce, served with hummus. The chicken was excellent, lightly spiced but well flavoured, and the roll itself was deliciously crunchy. I bit into it, and the juices oozed out, giving the dish just the right bit of moistness that it needed.Fidahh sells dips, toothere is the garlicky chickpea hummus, the yoghurt dip tzatziki and the grilled eggplant dip, babaghanoush100 grams for Rs. 160. You can try out the hummus bil lamb, the dip prepared with chickpeas, garlic, tahini and olive oil, served with marinated lamb chunks and pita bread. If you get the pita, that is.The region loves its meat, but they have a great many vegetable dishes too. So Fidahh has quite a comprehensive vegetarian section. Paneer, alas, figures prominently there, thanks to a demand for it, no doubt. The Fidahh special vegetable roll (Rs. 220)  a meal in itselfconsists of red, green and yellow peppers with paneer wrapped in a pita bread. There is spinach and cheese kabab (Rs. 265) and tabulleh wrap (Rs. 199) with tomato, onion, parsley, mint, lentils and pomegranate seeds). There is even something called falafel chaat for Rs. 200.There is a harissa (hot chilli pepper paste) chicken steak with summer grilled vegetables for those who want something substantial. And there are stews for those who like their gravies  lamb, chicken and fish stew that costs between Rs. 300 and Rs. 320.The food is delivered to the neighbourhood. The official address is TDI South Bridge, Shop No 6, Food Court, Lower Ground Floor, Nehru Place Metro Terminal, and the phone numbers are 9911166951 and 9971166951.I liked the look of the place, and the food. Its light, but not bland. And its flavourful but not drowned with spices. I felt sated after my semi-Iranian meal. I thought of friends long gone from my life, and wished them peace, wherever they are."
593bec567be9e04956d79822,A bumper farm crisis,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-bumper-farm-crisis/article18470885.ece,2017-05-17,,The Hindu,"Farmers in some States are regretting their abundant yields this year as the prices of agricultural commodities have crashed. Chilli farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, tomato growers in Karnataka, and toor dal cultivators in Maharashtra are at the centre of a severe crisis that has witnessed prices fall by more than half in a matter of just weeks. Some speculate that high commodity prices last year caused farmers to respond by boosting production, which in turn led to the present price crash.Whether it is the wholesale mandi s where farmers sell their agricultural produce, or retail outlets where consumers buy them, price fluctuations are common. But whether such fluctuations can be explained as being due to mindless crop cultivation, as some speculate, is not as certain. For one, in the consumer market, commodity speculators usually dampen price fluctuations by managing supply according to consumer demand. For instance, when the supply of grains is abundant, speculators do not flood the market with all their stock but instead hoard the grains and sell them later when supply turns scarce. Thus, even if farmers engage in mindless grain production, speculators usually save the day for consumers by preventing steep rises and falls in grain prices.Price fluctuationsSecond, in the wholesale market, speculators can save farmers from similar price fluctuations by paying a competitive price for their produce even when there is abundant supply. Grain traders, to return to our previous example, who want to hoard supply expecting higher grain prices in the future would be willing to pay a better price to farmers today. This comes not out of compassion for farmers, but purely out of competition with other grain traders. When farmers are free to sell their produce to any trader they want, it is traders paying the best price who get hold of it. Farmers can also expect a more predictable price for their produce each season, reflecting stable consumer prices, thus preventing mindless cultivation.Such competition though is precisely what is missing from the Indian agricultural scene where the supply chain is broken. Red tape, including limits on stocking agricultural products, has prevented the growth of a robust market for commodity speculation. The result is lack of investment in infrastructure like that of cold storage; about 40% of agricultural produce in India is wasted because of it. This, in turn, has led to price fluctuations that have affected both the farmer and the consumer. Wholesale agricultural prices are determined by trader cartels that block competitive bidding. This significantly reduces the price farmers can get for their products, while boosting the profits of some privileged traders. By some estimates, farmers receive only 20-25% of what the final consumer pays for his product. Thus, a free market in agriculture can be the best antidote to the crisis facing Indian farmers."
