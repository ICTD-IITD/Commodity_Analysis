And with two other areas outside, one that is bustling with DJs chartbusters and another quieter space outdoors, where you can enjoy the meal along with the beautiful Bengaluru weather.Their new menu is born out of sustainable living practices. It includes sustainable food that is made out of locally sourced ingredients. They use deep sea fish and their chicken is claimed to be antibiotic and artificial hormone free. While today several restaurants in the city boasts of offering healthy food on their menu, Fava claims to be one of the very few that aims for ethical food.The Polenta Crusted Crispy Goat Cheese and Thyme Roll is crunchy on the outside and its insides melt as soon as you take a bite. It is served with a spiced tomato relish. The Plated Smoked Salmon Labneh is cooked very well and has subtle flavours of capers, dill and paprika ruling the palate. The Grilled Deep Sea Prawn with Black Sesame too is cooked right and has the smoky flavour of the prawn that blends well with chilli, garlic and extra virgin olive oil seasoning. In the Plated Mezze and Salad category, I absolutely fell in love with Father Michaels Valombrossa Burrata.If there was one word I could use to describe it, then it would be beautiful. The dish is a maple tree farm organic beetroot mezze with dukkah and popped amaranth. The Melon, Watermelon & Feta Salad is what you call basic done right. The dish is simple and lets the fruits and the feta take a centrestage with its natural flavours, which by the way are absolutely fresh tasting. The dish is tempered with pomegranate, mint, arugula, balsamic reduction and extra virgin olive oil. Among pizzas, I tried the multi grain vegetarian Funghi Misti pizza. It tastes fresh out of the oven with toppings of corn, jalapeno, bell pepper, onion and mozzarella.In the main course, I would highly recommend the Mediterranean Style Stir-fry with Millet & Black Rice Risotto. The dish is warm, tastes fresh and healthy thanks to the locally sourced grains that take the stage to recreate an Italian Classic with organic vegetables. Among the non vegetarian dishes, the Signature Pomegranate Chicken is a must have. The chicken is very well cooked with the subtle pomegranate flavour. It is served with chargrilled vegetables and parsley-arugula vichyssoise. At Fava, the kitchen uses Earth Loaf chocolates made from Indian cacao beans. The chocolates are made in Mysuru.If you are in the mood to experiment, try Favas homemade liquid nitrogen infused 100% natural ice cream, sorbet and frozen yoghurt with topping. I had it in caramel popcorn. The ice cream is super smooth and has a strong caramel flavour. It was topped with a few caramel popcorn. My favourite, however, is the Duet of Chocolate Fondant . It has the chocolate crunch, with a gooey foundant that oozes when you dip in your spoon. It is a play on hot and cold chocolate flavours. Do give this one a try.Among cocktails, I tried the liquid nitrogen infused house special Cocktails including Fava Martini, Pink Bramble and Morgan Colada. I particularly enjoyed the Fava Martini that had a good punch of gin that blends well with cranberry juice, gingerm blue curacao, grenadine and fresh lime.Morgan Colada too was an interesting combination, especially for Captain Morgan rum fans. This cocktail has spiced rum mixed with pineapple juice and coconut milk. Other than these, the Tiramisu cocktail too was an interesting spin on the dessert. It has tequila, Baileys mascarpone and espresso. Id say if you are ending your meall with a drink, let it be Tiramisu.Cost for two: `1,900 (approx.)"

While horticulture cultivation in the district has come down only by 6% this year, statistics with the horticulture department show that vegetable cultivation has gone up by 600 hectares or around 9%, due to increase in cultivation of onion.Data shows that almost 50% of the land in the district under fruits, spices, vegetables and flower cultivation is drip irrigated. In 2016-2017, 36,539 hectares of horticulture crops were cultivated in the district against cultivation on 39,000 hectares in the previous financial year. ""While the acreage under fruits, spices and flowers has come down in the district, the area under vegetable cultivation has actually increased by 600 hectares. So acreage wise, we do not see much of a difference from the previous year yet,"" said the deputy director of horticulture, A Ramakrishnan. ""But the cultivation this year has witnessed a noticeable drop when compared to that in 2014-2015 - when we had good rains,"" he said.While acreage under crops like banana, turmeric and tomato has fallen by 200 hectares to 300 hectares, area under onions has gone up. ""Banana and turmeric are long-term crops that require more water and so does tomato to give a good yield. Thus, many farmers have turned to vegetables like onions, chillies and lady's finger which are less fleshy and require less water,"" said Ramakrishnan.The area under plantation crops too has increased by 1,000 hectares, mainly because cocoa inter-crop plantations were also taken into account. Officials attribute the farmers' confidence to cultivate even in the face of such a severe drought, to drip irrigation. ""In the district, only farmers with assured water and irrigation facilities bother cultivating their land. They stopped completely relying on rainfall many years ago,"" said Vasanthi Gnanasekharan, assistant director of horticulture department, Thondamuthur block.""In our district, if you remove the 15,000 hectares of plantation crops like tea, coffee, banana and cocoa from the equation, at least 50% of the remaining 21,000 hectares of cultivable land are drip irrigated,"" said Ramakrishnan. ""Drip irrigation becomes critical during drought situations, because with one large tank of water, we can add the required fertilizer and water almost five acres for four days,"" said A Veeramani, a chilly farmer in Madukkarai . ""In normal situations, the water stock would get over in a day or two, and will not cover the entire five acres,"" he said.The horticulture department now targets getting the entire area under fruit, vegetable and spice cultivation in the district under drip irrigation within the next five years. ""We hope to achieve our targets within three years or maximum five years,"" said Ramakrishnan. ""The government's subsidies of 75% to 100% for the programme also play a major role in achieving our target,"" he said."

While growers are helplessly watching crops wilting, skyrocketing prices are making vegetables unaffordable for most Bengalureans.The worst hit vegetables are tomatoes, gourds, beans and ladys finger, apart from coconuts. The inflow of vegetables such as raddish, carrot, brinjal and cauliflower has fallen steeply, according to M. Muniraju, marketing supervisor, Kolar Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee. There is simply no water, he said.Steep fall in tomato prices during September-December has led to fewer farmers sowing tomatoes in Kolar, but even this crop is hit by drought. There is a large scale loss of tomatoes and the crop harvested this time is not of great quality. I have lost everything this season, said Adireddy, a farmer from Chintamani.A senior procurement official from a leading retail chain in the city said the arrival of quality tomatoes was down to a trickle leading to a surge in prices. A kg of tomato is being sold between Rs. 26 and Rs. 30 in the city.Gourds affected tooThe entire range of gourds, the main crop grown in Devanahalli-Chickballapur belt, has taken a severe beating too.The average price of these gourds in the city retail markets is at an all-time high of about Rs. 60 to Rs. 65 per kg. There is a severe shortage for even drinking water, and its no wonder agriculture has taken a back seat. Most of the tubewells have dried up rendering horticulture paralysed. We are buying drinking water, lamented G. Muniswamy Gowda, a farmer from Devanahalli.Irregular power supply has only worsened the situation. V. Jagadeesha, a farmer from Hoskote, said power is supplied for about three hours during night, which is often intermittent. Only those who have got drip irrigation facility in their farms are saved from the ordeal. Even though you have water in the tubewells, it cannot be drawn without power supply, he said.Vegetable prices are traditionally low during December-March period, as it is the season of avarekai (field beans). However, this season, the arrival of avarekai in the city has come down to a meagre 20% to 30% of the usual. A kg of avarekai is still trading as high as Rs. 40, while by this time it should have been less than Rs. 15.Unless there is rain in March, expected during Ugadi festival, the price of vegetables are only expected to skyrocket, making them scarce in the city and pushing farmers into further distress, said senior officials of HOPCOMs.There is a large-scale loss of tomatoes and the crop harvested this time is not of great quality.

The newly-opened cafe, which is run by jail inmates serving life sentence, offers eatables and other products which, as the management proudly announces, are made in jail.To top it all, the notion of being served by jailbirds does not bother customers in the least. On the contrary, they appear to be intrigued by the idea. The ever-present crowd of patrons suggests the obvious lack of ""happy hours"". Many of those who visit the cafe once end up as regular customers and a stream of suggestions pours in.On a regular day at the cafe, Jai Chand, 49 and Yog Raj , 27, don chef 's hats and dish out orders with a brisk efficiency characteristic of professional cooks. Outside the kitchen, customers sit back amid the scenic environs, engrossed in books, pizza and piping hot chai. The chefs' life term at Kaithu Jail , is merely an incidental fact soon forgotten in the comforting aroma of fresh food. The location of the cafe at Takka Bench above the historic Ridge , en-route to the famous Jakhu temple assures a steady stream of visitors. The picturesque location, good food and the lure of books makes it a perfect draw for tourists. The library includes books by Chetan Bhagat, Nikita Singh, Jules Verne Sherlock Holmes and Robin Sharma.Subjects of environment, tourism and Shimla's history have also been covered.The cafe, which can accommodate 40 persons, has been built at a cost of Rs 20 lakh. It remains open from 10 am to 9pm.Besides tourists, the cafe also draws a number of local residents. Appreciating this concept of jail reforms, Shimla resident Nirupama Chaudhary has become a regular customer in the last one week. ""On completion of their sentence, inmates can run their own cafe or restaurant, which will make them self-dependent in future,"" she said.However, she feels readers of newspapers and periodicals should also be catered to. ""It is not possible to read books for hours.In case of hurry, we can go through newspapers and magazines while sipping tea or coffee,"" she suggested, adding that her favourite articles on the menu are pizza and burger.The menu includes tea, coffee, tomato soup, veg paneer puff, veg burger, cup cake, muffin, pastry, medium pizza, peanut cookies, cream roll and karara special, an improved version of hot dog. All these dishes are made in the jails of Kaithu and Kandaghat. Jakhu resident Ajay Sohan Lal said he has been a regular visitor since the day the book cafe opened. ""This is the best place and even the concept is new. I can have coffee while reading a book, which, otherwise, was not possible in the library located close to this cafe,"" he said.Lal wholeheartedly supports the concept of jail reforms. ""People make mistakes in life and everyone should be given the chance to repent and make a new beginning. Both Jai Chand and Yog Raj are very courteous and their service also is very good,"" he said.On his part, Jai Chand feels his role as chef makes incarceration a more humane experience. He has only completed eight years of his jail term but hopes to open his own book cafe on his release from jail. Going by the increasing business volume, people hope he makes it. ""The customer base is increasing and sales are picking up. At the moment, everyday sales are between Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000.This is expected to increase in the days to come,"" he says.The way he handles his responsibilities shows it is not just a job for him. ""This place matters. The cafe has given us a chance to connect with the outside world,"" he said.Yog Raj also said he loves interacting with people. He expressed gratitude to the authorities for giving him another chance and said he would make the most of it."

With the cost of production spiralling, farmers of milk-producing districts are distraught.Unable to get fodder in their vicinity, they source it from distant places at high costs. Despite a government incentive, the establishment of fodder banks and the recent hike in milk prices, farmers of Kolar, Mandya and Shivamogga, which are among the high milk-producing districts, are complaining about the increase in input costs.Dairy farmers of Mandya are looking at Mysuru, Chamarajanagar and other districts to source fodder. Paddy cultivation suffered owing to drought, and this has resulted in shortage of dry grass, said Satisha, a farmer from Budhanuru. Savithramma of Bellur said cattle required at least 15 kg of green fodder every day. She purchases fodder at Rs. 10 a kg  double the normal price of Rs. 5.Steep hikeIn Kolar, fodder availability has been adversely affected as farmers have turned to tomato cultivation, despite the administrations attempt to convince them to grow jowar, which yields good green fodder. With the onset of the tomato season, farmers have moved away from jowar for higher returns.In Shivamogga, the cost has risen steeply as a tonne of fodder, which cost about Rs. 5,800 in March/April 2016, is now being sold at Rs. 11,000 to milk producers coming under the Shivamogga Milk Union Ltd., which covers Shivamogga, Davangere and Chitradurga districts.The situation is similar in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi, where the cost of fodder has increased from Rs. 11 / Rs. 12 to Rs. 15 / Rs. 16 a kg.Sources in the Karnataka Milk Federation acknowledged the shortage but said the federation was confident of sailing through the dry season as many places in the high milk-producing centres had received rainfall.The Animal Husbandry Department confirmed that there was a shortage of fodder.We have established fodder banks but they can meet only part of the demand. Fodder is being given at highly subsidised cost of Rs. 2 a kg, an official said."

5922eea37be9e01fc7f5c05a,Non-veg fare? Only if you are a foreigner,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/non-veg-fare-only-if-you-are-a-foreigner/articleshow/58571263.cms,2017-05-08,"If you are not a foreigner , you will not be served non-vegetarian food at private hospitals in Ahmedabad. Hospitals, in general, are not known for serving appetizing meals . However, patients here face a different sort of problem, revealed a Mirror Check. Hospitals here force you to follow vegetarianism, especially if you are Indian. They either flatly refuse to serve non-vegetarian food to Indians, or ask you to shift to the international ward to get the fare of your choice. These same hospitals have no such restrictions for foreigners admitted there. In their defence, the hospitals claim that they serve vegetarian food to Indian patients 'to respect the sentiments of the majority', but make an exception for foreign patients 'as they aren't used to vegetarian food'.UN-FARE PRACTICE AT HOSPITALSMirror visited eight hospitals to check the ground reality. Of these, Sterling, Columbia Asia, Zydus, and SAL -- serve vegetarian fare to patients and their relatives. They also do not allow people to eat non-vegetarian food on the premises, even if it has been brought from home. Of the four remaining hospitals, CIMS and HCG serve non-vegetarian fare but only to foreign patients. They do not cook the food on the premises. Instead, they order it from eateries. At Apollo hospital, non-vegetarian food is prepared on the premises and served freely to foreign patients. Indians are served non-vegetarian food only if there is a ""medical requirement"". Non-vegetarian food is prepared and served to both Indian and foreign patients at Krishna Shalby, provided the Indian patients shift to the international wing of the hospital. None of these hospitals have issued or put up any official notification in this regard.Taking objection to the unfair treatment, bank officer J K Nair (49), whose wife was recently hospitalised, says, ""This is discrimination, plain and simple. We cannot be treated as second-grade people in our own country for something as rudimentary as our food choices. If hospitals think it is okay for a foreign patient to consume non-vegetarian food, what ground do they have to deny us the same option?"" Mohammed Jamaluddin (52), an engineer whose nephew has been hospitalised for the past 10 days, says, ""The hospital may not want to cook non-vegetarian food in its kitchen but they should at least allow us to bring it from home. We respect other people's feelings. We can eat it in a secluded corner or in our room with our relatives.I have been to hospitals in Mumbai and they do not have any such restrictions. No one should be deprived of the basic freedom to eat what they want."" Businessman Abbas Manji Pir Bhai also pointed out that such discrimination existed only here. ""My daughter was admitted to a hospital in Delhi for afew weeks. They offered non-vegetarian fare to all patients, whether Indian or foreign,"" says the 67-year-old. Satbir Singh (24), an engineer, believes food goes a long way in curing a patient as much as medicines do. ""Being a non-vegetarian, I know that chicken soup would make me feel much better than tomato soup would. So long as I am having it in my private space, it should not be a problem for anybody.""Meanwhile, hospitals claim they do not offer non-vegetarian fare to Indian patients out of respect. Dr Nikhil Lala, centre head of Sterling says, ""I see no need for our hospital to provide non-vegetarian food as it is not a medical need. We ensure that the patient's protein requirement is fulfilled through vegetarian food."" Bhanupratap Hada, operation head of Zydus confirms, ""We do not serve non-vegetarian food in our hospitals. We have our own kitchen and patients are not allowed food from outside."" SAL Hospital refused to issue an official statement, but clarifies that it serves only vegetarian food.Apollo hospital states, ""A variety of specialised meals, including non-vegetarian fare, are provided to our patients on the advice of our doctors and dieticians. We have separate kitchen and storage facilities for cooking vegetarian and non-vegetarian food items."" Dr Bharat Gadhvi, regional director of HCG Gujarat, admits that Indians and foreigners were offered separate fares at the hospital. ""We get nonvegetarian food from outside for international patients only. For the rest of the patients and their relatives everything is strictly vegetarian.""'80PER CENT PATIENTS ARE VEGETARIANS'On allowing non-vegetarian food only to foreigners, Dr Anish Chandarana, executive director of CIMS hospital clarifies, ""It is hard for international patients to sustain a vegetarian diet as they are not used to it. Hence, we get it for them from hotels. The reason why hospitals have adopted a vegetarian- only policy for Indians is because 80 per cent of patients tend to be vegetarian and they may have a very strong emotional reaction to people who eat non-vegetarian food around them."" Explaining why Indian patients have to be shifted to another wing if they want to have non-vegetarian fare, Shanay Vikram Shah, director of Shalby hospitals says, ""We have a separate kitchen on the top floor for non-vegetarian food. The international wing is located on the floor below it and all the patients there are provided non-vegetarian food. If there are any Indian patients who need non-vegetarian fare, they can have it after shifting to the international wing.""DIFFERENT CITIES, DIFFERENT POLICIESInterestingly, some hospitals which have branches in Ahmedabad as well as other cities have policies that differ according to the city it is in. For example, Columbia Asia of Ahmedabad allows only vegetarian but their Bangalore branch has no restrictions upon non-vegetarian food. Gaurav Anand, general manager of Columbia Asia, confirms they allow ""only vegetarian"" food in the hospital. However, Pratyush Srivastava, general manager of Columbia Asia Hospital at Whitefield in Bangalore says, ""We serve non-vegetarian food to patients and their kin. We do not allow outside food in the hospital.The food served here is prepared in our kitchen as per guidelines from the dietician."" A hospital has every right to institute rules, but then it should be implemented without discrimination, avers designer Reuben Vaz (23). ""If their policy is pro-vegetarian, then it should be the same for everyone. If the Indians are not being provided non-vegetarian food, then foreigners should not be provided the same. It is not like foreigners have never had vegetarian food in their entire lives. It shouldn't be a problem for them to survive on it for a few days. People should not be divided based on their food choices,"" he says."
