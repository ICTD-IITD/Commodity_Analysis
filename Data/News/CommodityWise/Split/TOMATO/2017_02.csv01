(Right) The logo of the canteen.Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Friday finalised modalities to launch the ambitious Indira Canteen project offering subsidised breakfast and meals to the urban poor in Bengaluru.At a meeting at his official residence, Siddaramaiah directed starting the project from August 15.The state government is pumping in Rs 100 crore for the project while the BBMP will be the nodal agency for its implementation.Mayor G Padmavathi told reporters after the meeting that canteens will be made up of pre-cast structures manufactured by KEF Infra at their Tamil Nadu facility.The firm has quoted Rs 32 lakh for constructing each canteen with a carpet area of 860 sq ft. She said Siddaramaiah has directed officials to negotiate with KEF Infra to reduce the construction cost.Padmavathi said, There will be 199 canteens including the one at the BBMP head office and 28 kitchens, one each in every Assembly constituency in the city. These canteens can accommodate 70 to 80 people at a time. There will be a coupon system offering meals and tiffin to a maximum of 250 people in one slot.The Mayor said each canteen will have two toilets, a CCTV camera and food a distribution court. The utensils will belong to the state government so that services are not hampered in case food supply contract is terminated and transferred to another agency.The contracts will be finalised by May 30 and work would commence from June 1.

The first sign of stirring was with the opening of Rakesh Talwars Spare Kitchen II, followed by the jazzy and spacious Matahari night club and now, most recently Swey.Spread across a sprawl of 14,000 square feet, Swey can accommodate 400 people at a go. The eatery, located on the malls level four, is whatever you want it to be: a caf, a pub, a bar or a restaurant that serves you wholesome food, under corporate chef Clyde Comellos direction. Owners Gaurav Dabrai, Vicky and Kabir Luthria, (who also own the kitschy Dishikiyaaon at Bandra Kurla Complex and Copa at Juhu), have utilised the space well, ensuring pockets of private party spaces for large groups ranging from 10 to 30 people.We love the restaurants direction pole that points to all their outposts across the city. Fun elements like a phone booth where you can step in to take a call, and a mandatory stop for all diners: a copper swing for selfies  are the lighter design touches.The rooftop bar has a drinks menu thats by far the best we have tried in a long time. Food and drink meet in two cocktails that we tried out. The first: a cheese me martini (Rs. 550) does not overwhelm the palate but makes its presence felt with the blue cheese and stuffed olives. The second, an apple a day (Rs. 550), which is vodka mixed with a buttery apple jam, comes with an apple crumble rim. If you like to mix your dessert and drinks, this one is for you. But the drink, who knows Donald (Rs. 650), with bourbon-soaked cranberries, with homemade bitters and sugar, steals our hearts. One of our dinner companions succumbs to healthier option: a kale and hearty (Rs. 500), a light vodka-based drink which tastes of a cooling cucumber and kale juice, an admirable combination.The food and drinks menus have been designed by outlet chef Hansel Baptista, and from the first bite of magic mushrooms (Rs. 350), in which the crispy roasted fungi act as makeshift sliders holding cheese and beetroot slices, we know we are in for a treat. The wood-fired pizzas are juicy square flat breads, which are easier to eat. The smoky salmon and ricotta pizza (Rs. 750) has the sweetness of red onions balanced by the sourness of tiny balsamic jelly beans. The feta beignets (Rs. 375) are deep-fried and bland but for the addition of sweet tomato jam reserve. The stuffed calamari (Rs. 500) with a centre-filling of masala prawn chilly fry is chewy, but the zing of East Indian bottle masala dominates pleasantly.Chef Baptista presents the duck waffle two ways but in a croissant just for us to try. The chunks of duck pieces are pan-seared and medium-rare cooked in a pomegranate jus, and a tangy duck confit with orange tang and spices. We are instant fans of the healthy veg spaghetti (Rs. 450) that has thinly sliced veggies as noodles, and spiced roast cashews tossed in a Himalayan rhododendron vinaigrette that adds crunch. The deconstructed ham and cheese toasty salad (Rs. 450) falls flat for its bland dressing as we dont enjoy bite-size pieces of ham slices between toasted bread.For the main course we settle for a kimchi fried rice (Rs. 500) which is peppered with spiced tofu, fried lotus root and thin strips of noori. A Korean dish which traditionally comprises a broken egg, we are served a sunny side up, which we prefer as is. The dish is a roller-coaster of textures  the crunch of lotus stem, and raw vegetables, the softness of tofu pieces and al dente rice cooked in a fiery red sauce.By now, we are stuffed, but theres plenty of room for dessert. We begin with three shots (Rs. 750), which can be ordered sans alcohol too: a negroni with 55% dark chocolate, cinnamon flavoured yogurt and orangechilo cheesecake. The negroni shot has a potato chip dunked in chocolate sauce, while the flavoured yoghurt needs more cinnamon. The orangechilo cheesecake rules our palate with its tangy presence. The syrups are all house made and the absence of synthetic syrup ensures we wont croak with a hoarse voice the next day.Dive into dessertsA fitting end to the meal is the desserts. The bittersweet symphony of theres bourbon in my cheesecake (Rs. 330) topped with a smoked honey is a hit. But the pice de rsistance is the hazelnut entremet. The dessert has a crunchy ganache base topped with a hazelnut meringue thats served with a coffee amaretto Bavarian ice cream with caramel. Self-taught baker and dessert chef Tanvi Kirawant, or as she likes to call herself the Nagpur tigress, tells it takes her 50 steps to make the dessert. We manage to polish it off in five, quick bites.Swey at Atria, Worli, is open from 6 p.m. to 1.30 a.m.; 9820436666"

Additionally, the temperatures are touching 36-37 degrees Celsius this summer,"" he said. The rise in temperature results in vegetables rotting earlier than usual, af fecting supply, Gopi added.""Last week, the per-kg price of beans was Rs 40-50, but is now Rs 70-80, carrot is up from Rs 30-35 to Rs 45, beetroot was Rs 15-18 and is now Rs 25, and brinjal was Rs 20-25 but is now Rs 30-45,"" he said.Potato and onion prices, though, are the same, while tomato prices have fallen from Rs 10-15 to Rs 7-8.Ibraz Khan, a wholesaler in KR Market, said the price spiral may not dent business. ""Prices of vegetables such as beans have increased because of the heat; tomato prices have fallen due to heavy production,"" he said. Prices have definitely gone up over the past 15 days due to a change in weather,"" said A M Mustaq Ahmed , a vegetable vendor in Russell Market. ""Water scarcity during summer is a common issue which often leads to an in crease in the price of vegetables. This year too, there has been an increase in the price of carrots, bottlegourd and capsicum. Carrots, which earlier sold for Rs 42, are now selling for Rs 50. The price of capsicum and bottlegourd is up by Rs 10 each,"" said an employee at a supermarket chain."

Its their ATM in fact. The rural economy here would have been battered but for African Tall Maize (ATM).The crop is providing an assured and steady income for farmers while also boosting dairy farming with a regular supply of fodder for cattle. ATM, a low water-intensive crop, is being grown throughout the year now as a fodder crop.Concerted efforts by local farmers, the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) and the Kolar district administration in encouraging cultivation of ATM are now paying dividends.Suresh is among the many farmers in Doddahasahalla village of Kolar taluk who have entered into an agreement with the local milk cooperative union to grow ATM. ""Earlier, I used to grow tomato or other vegetables, he says. The problem with tomato is that you are never sure of the income. If all goes well, I might make Rs 1.5 lakh per acre in one season and almost nothing the next.""Fed up with unpredictable rains and unreliable support prices, Suresh decided to grow ATM. Now he is assured of around Rs 50,000 per acre with the ATM fodder pre-sold to dairy farmers in his village.M Venkatesh, a farmer of E Kamballi village is an ATM fan too. ""Earlier, it was difficult to get fodder, especially in the summer.We used to import dried fodder from Andhra or Tamil Nadu which is not good for cattle,"" he said. It was also a costly affair, as each kilo of dry fodder costs Rs 10-15. Due to ATM initiative ,farmers like Venkatesh are now getting fresh fodder for less than half that amount.Dry fodder, according to Dr Chennakeshava, deputy director of animal husbandry, causes a lot of complications for cattle. ""Apart from causing blisters in their mouths, dry fodder results in kidney stones among cattle and reduces the quality and quantity of milk produced,"" he said.Dr Srinivas Gowda, deputy manager of KMF, said that since November 2016, the states Animal Husbandry Department and KMF have distributed almost 70,000 mini-kits of ATM seeds. He said agreements are being made with farmers to grow all the fodder that is required to feed cattle in the district. ""ATM fodder has increased the quantity of milk generated by two to three litres per animal, he added.Speaking to New Indian Express, Dr K V Thrilok Chandra, deputy commissioner of Kolar district, explained that such a project was essential, as 90 per cent of the 2.76 lakh heads of cattle in the district were milch cows. ""Since starting this project, the solid not fat (SNF) content of milk too has increased, making farmers eligible for incentives offered by the state government,""he said.Though there are several other projects to improve water availability, and others are being implemented in the district, the ATM project has impacted many people in a short period. Maintaining that Kolar is the first district where fodder cultivation is being taken up on a large scale, he said the model can be emulated elsewhere to ensure income security for farmers."

In fact, ads have a two-way link with society. Firstly, ads reflect the prevailing social mores and preferences of the people.For example, the matrimonial ads in India at one time used to seek as groom in order of preference: doctors, engineers, chartered accountants and, as last resort, professors. Some were even more categorical in specifying that the brides family would consider only doctors having degrees from UK and engineers from IITs. Then, over time, with the rising flow of Indian IT professionals abroad, such people working in USA, and Europe began to occupy the pride of place in the list.For some families, apart from enjoying a better material standard of living, staying abroad had the further attraction that it would enable the bride to stay away from the in-laws family. More recently, with MBAs  particularly from the top IIMs  typically earning more than engineers, IIM MBAs have entered the list. Also, an increasing number of matrimonial ads are asking for working brides, instead of housewives, to supplement family income. At the same time, the proliferation of fairness cream ads testifies the premium that the Indian society, by and large, still places on fair skin.It is also interesting to observe how the products promoted by the ads have changed over time. With rising affluence (and aspirations) of the new generation along with easier availability of bank loans for consumer products, the ads for simple consumer goods like basic soaps, detergents and tooth pastes are giving way to more upscale products like body perfumes, air conditioners, motor bikes, cars, LED TVs, smartphones, jewellery, diamonds, flats and villas.Secondly, advertisers  through their ads and promotional campaigns  try to change the tastes, habits, choices and the aspirations of the public. They would make you believe that life is largely meaningless if you dont have a smart phone, shoes, watch, perfume, motorbike, car of a specific brand to distinguish you from the hoi polloi or to make a fashion statement for you.Advertisers particularly target children as, apart from being more impressionable, they are having an increasing say in family purchase decisions in todays society. In addition, investing in changing their preferences is likely to yield higher returns as their life span is longer.In this game of marketing and promotion, celebrities play a significant role. This is an age-old technique. Older people would remember seeing ads in newspapers and movie theatres (long before the advent of TVs) depicting film stars like Nargis or Madhubala using Lux soap every day. The same tradition is continuing, except that the range of products promoted by film stars and sports personalities has widened enormously. Even some state governments are employing such personalities as brand ambassadors for the purpose of attracting tourists or investments.Why do companies pay enormous sums to hire the services of such celebrities to promote their brands? There are two possible reasons. One, the face of a celebrity attracts the viewers attention immediately to the ad and the product stays in the mind of the viewer through association.Second, the fact that a company can afford to pay the huge sum to the celebrity implies that the product must be a good one bringing a lot of revenue. That helps establish the quality of the product in the minds of prospective buyers.Should celebrities be held accountable for the quality of the product or the service being advertised by them? True, it is not possible for an outsider to know fully about the quality (including any fraudulent claims made by the company).Product qualityYet, the celebrities  because of their celebrity status being used to sell the product or service to unsuspecting people  should exercise due diligence before endorsing. Since they are earning huge money, at least they should be made to pay some monetary penalty if they are found endorsing a product making false claims. That would make them more circumspect.Do companies have to spend on ads to survive? In theory, if the products being sold by different firms are identical in quality and consumers also think so, then it does not pay for any firm to spend on ads. Since the identical products would sell at the same price, the extra cost incurred on ads cannot be recovered.That is why we dont see ads for potatoes or tomatoes but find ads for different brands of potato chips and tomato ketchups (as these are not considered identical by consumers). At the other extreme, a monopolist  because he gets 100% market share by definition  cannot gain by spending on ads except when the ad helps expand the total market of the product by making more consumers aware of the product or an improved variety of the product or by enhancing the image of the company by advertising its CSR activities.Is so much spending on ad socially justified? Here a distinction needs to be made between ads to disseminate information and ads to take away sales from the competitors. The first type provides some useful service to the society. The second does not add any net social benefit. One firms gain is cancelled by another firms loss.While ads at tax payers expense aimed at changing social attitudes like open defecation, child marriage, demanding dowry etc are justified, wastage of national resources occurs when politicians use page-long ads to promote themselves under the pretext of informing the public about the laying of foundation stone for a project.If providing information is the objective, a simple press note in the media or a smaller ad without the names and photos of the numerous ministers and politicians should do.(The writer is former Professor of Economics, IIM-Calcutta)"

5928f0b87be9e0137c781bac,A pencil capsule with seeds to  grow saplings,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/603155/a-pencil-capsule-seeds-grow.html,2017-03-25,"R Sathyanarayana in Chennai, March 26, 2017, DHNS 23:35 ISTMost schools in major cities are moving towards digitisation and expect children to use tablets to study. But ballpoint pen, pencil, eraser and notebooks continue to be part of their study. Students discard most materials after their academic year or when they are no more useable and go in for a new set.Now, thanks to the enterprising work by two computer science engineering graduates from Coimbatore district of Tamil Nadu, a pencil's stub can be grown into a sapling.S Ranjith Kumar and A Rajakamalesh had noticed that valuable pencil stubs were being thrown away. As pencils are biowaste, the duo started making efforts to effectively utilise them.The two have named their innovation Farmcil, a blend of farming and pencil. Farmcil, the name given to the pencil, grows into a plant, contributing to the preservation of ecology. The unique pencil has a capsule at one end containing seeds, Ranjith Kumar said.Ranjith Kumar said the name Farmcil for the pencil is to emphasise the importance of farming not only in the region but also throughout the nation and to preserve the green cover on earth.Ranjith Kumar said Our family and educational background were responsible for us to take up issues such as global warming and unbridled pollution, resulting in deteriorating quality of earth. These developments have been directly affecting people.In January 2016, we thought of working on this innovative idea. Thereafter, we started doing research on the project. We had detailed discussions with the professors in the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. It took a concrete shape in August 2016, Ranjith Kumar said.According to him, the wood used for the Farmcil is natural and free from any toxins since children tend to put the Farmcil in their mouths while writing. The capsule at the end of the pencil is made from non-toxic bio-material. Even if children chew the bottom of the Farmcil, it will not harm them. Once the Farmcil gets wet because of the saliva, it becomes sticky. Therefore, the child will not attempt to put the Farmcil in the mouth again, he said.The seeds in the Farmcil capsule are either of vegetables or flower-bearing plants. The seeds could be of tomato, brinjal, okra, chilli or cluster beans or verbena, zinnia, cockscomb, sunflower or balsam.Once the capsule dissolves, seed sprouts and grows into a plant. The process could take between three and 10 days, depending on the plant variety. The plant will yield flowers or vegetables in about 40 to 50 days.Students could use the Farmcil till it becomes short. Then, the remaining portion should be inserted sideways in the soil. Soil should be covered till planting mark. The Farmcil should not be planted deep inside. In addition, the soil in the pot should be loosely filled. After a few days, the capsule gets dissolved and begins to expose seeds. It is easy for a student to plant the Farmcil since it has the planting mark, Ranjith said.Sprouting depends on the seed. For example, tomato could take a week whereas for okra it could be just four days. Likewise, sprouting for chilli, brinjal, cluster beans and sun flower is between five days and one week. The student will have a choice of growing plant of his choice by buying the right Farmcil.Ranjith said that students would be thrilled to see plants with colourful flowers and green vegetables and they would have the satisfaction of nurturing them. Gardening slowly becomes a habit for children as they develop pride and sense of responsibility towards nature preservation, he said. The product is patented under the intellectual property rights law and the trade mark registration for this brand is under process.He said that Farmcil aims to drive home the importance of farming and ecology preservation. Also this concept inculcates the habit of nurturing nature in children when they start using Farmcils in their kindergarten classes, he pointed out. The habit is likely to stand children in good stead when they grow up.At present, the duo has started supplying the environmental-friendly Farmcils to various NGOs across Tamil Nadu. We have a product unit called R & R Trading Company that produces about 18,000 pencils per day, Ranjith said.In a bid to empower women, Ranjith's unit has employed only female staff in the packing section. We are in the process of introducing more vegetable and flower seeds. We have 10 types of seeds now, he said. The Farmcil is priced at Rs 10."
592943127be9e0138af8da12,"Tomato cultivation hit by demonetisation and infestation, price likely to spike",http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/tomato-cultivation-hit-by-demonetisation-and-infestation-price-likely-to-spike-4566023/,2017-03-11,"Representational Image. Representational Image.This summer, tomato prices might see a spike as tomato plantations in Maharashtra have seen a sharp drop in output. Lack of ready cash with growers and an infestation of white flies is being attributed to the drop, which has affected the entire state. As against the 34,500 hectares of plantation used to cultivate tomato during summer, this year the state has seen 31,012 hectares of farmland used for the crop. The dip in area is significant in the tomato-growing districts of Pune, Nashik, Satara and Sangli.Watch What Else Is Making NewsDeepak Bhise, president of the Tomato Growers Federation of Narayangaon in Junnar taluka of Pune district, claimed that demonetisation was to be blamed for the dip in cultivation area as farmers didnt have enough cash. Tomato is a cash-intensive crop as farmers require costly inputs on an average, an acre of crop would require Rs 70,000 as input cost, he said.Currently, demonetisation and a sharp fall in prices of almost all farm produces have shaken the economics of rural areas, making farmers wary of heavy investments. Bhise, who normally plants five acres of tomatoes, has only planted three acres of the crop this year. Another reason for lesser cultivation is the apparent infestation of white flies in tomato-growing areas. Increase in onion acreage in the last few years has increased the prevalence of white flies in these areas. This pest destroys tomato crop, so many farmers have not opted for tomato this season, he said.According to traders at the wholesale markets, lesser agricultural area for tomatoes would result in an increase in the price of the vegetable in the days to come.In June last year, tomato prices had crossed the Rs 70 per kg mark in retail markets in many parts of the state, as a severe drought had destroyed the rabi crop. This year, lesser cultivation may also result in a spike in prices.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
