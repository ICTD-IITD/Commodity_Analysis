Data shows that almost 50% of the land in the district under fruits, spices, vegetables and flower cultivation is drip irrigated. In 2016-2017, 36,539 hectares of horticulture crops were cultivated in the district against cultivation on 39,000 hectares in the previous financial year. While the acreage under fruits, spices and flowers has come down in the district, the area under vegetable cultivation has actually increased by 600 hectares. So acreage wise, we do not see much of a difference from the previous year yet, said the deputy director of horticulture, A Ramakrishnan. But the cultivation this year has witnessed a noticeable drop when compared to that in 2014-2015 -when we had good rains, he said.While acreage under crops like banana, turmeric and tomato has fallen by 200 hectares to 300 hectares, area under onions has gone up. Banana and turmeric are long-term crops that require more water and so does tomato to give a good yield. Thus, many farmers have turned to vegetables like onions, chillies and ladys finger which are less fleshy and require less water, said Ramakrishnan.The area under plantation crops too has increased by 1,000 hectares, mainly because cocoa inter-crop plantations were also taken into ac count. Officials attribute the farm ers confidence to cultivate even in the face of such a severe drought, to drip irrigation. In the district, only farmers with assured water and ir rigation facilities bother cultivating their land. They stopped completely relying on rainfall many years ago, said Vasanthi Gnanasekharan, as sistant director of horticulture de partment, Thondamuthur block.In our district, if you remove the 15,000 hectares of plantation crops like tea, coffee, banana and cocoa from the equation, at least 50% of the remaining 21,000 hectares of cultivable land are drip irrigated, said Ramakrishnan. Drip irrigation becomes critical during drought situations, because with one large tank of water, we can add the required fertilizer and water almost five acres for four days, said A Veeramani, a chilly farm er in Madukkarai. In normal situa tions, the water stock would get over in a day or two, and will not cover the entire five acres, he said.The horticulture department now targets getting the entire area under fruit, vegetable and spice cultivation in the district under drip irrigation with in the next five years. We hope to achieve our targets within three years or maximum five years, said Ram akrishnan."

Sarah Hafeez A row of vacant shops line the pavements. Sarah HafeezIn business for the last four decades, the Rajput Lohars of west Delhi have for the first time realised what it means to be in the midst of a slowdown. Their businesses are yet to recover from the demonetisation shock. This is the first time in the last 40 years that we have been waiting for a buyer before we can fix the next meal. We have never been in loss and we cant move to any other business because working iron is the only craft we have mastered since the age of 12, Jeet Kumar, an ironsmith from Rajasthans Chittorgarh, says, exactly three months after demonetisation was announced.Watch What Else is Making NewsEarthen hearths and anvils in the row of vacant-looking shops selling hammers, pick-axes, tongs, woks, sickles, pans, knives and an array of tools and parts line the pavements of Pankha road off the Tihar Jail complex. With no customers, owners stay indoors tending to family and preparing lunch.Till late last month, they were surviving on rotis and tomato chutney. This is because November and December saw everyone queuing up outside banks and forcing shops to stay shut, the ironsmiths said.We fear our business will never go back to the way it was. We are almost distress-selling. Our customers, most of whom are labourers or factory workers, just dont come. Hammers and narrow chisels, which used to be essentials, are being bought with frugal care, Priya, Jeets relative, says after haggling with Virender Singh, the first customer at her shop this Wednesday.She ends up selling a hammer head for Rs 70, Rs 20 less than they would have sold it for to the most stubborn customer.Virender Singh, a stone polisher who got work commissioned to him by a local contractor in Janakpuri for the first time in three months, says the construction industry has slumped. There is no work. Buildings have been left half built. Sab bandh pada hai (Everything has come to a standstill), Singh said.Factories in nearby Mayapuri industrial area, which saw workers buying tools and wares from the ironsmiths of Pankha road and Mayapuri Phase II, have slashed production, fired workers and done away with the second shift which got workers their overtime. It took years for these factory units to set up and expand but only a few weeks for the whole chain of production to collapse, IFTUs general secretary (Delhi) Rajesh Kumar said.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

The district administration had clamped night curfew in Silapathar on Wednesday, which was made indefinite from Friday after six shops were set ablaze in the heart of the town. On March 6, members and supporters of Nikhil Bharat Bangali Udbastu Samanway Samitee (Nibbuss) attacked the All Assam Students' Union (AASU) office, with a ripple effect. Normalcy is yet to return. The administration had yesterday relaxed curfew for two hours to let people buy essential commodities, whose scarcity was such that tomato was being sold at Rs 50 per kg. As no fresh incident was reported last night, the administration decided to relax curfew from 11am to 3pm today to enable people to enjoy Holi. For a few hours residents of the town immersed in the spirit of Holi by smearing colours on each other. ""It looks like Holi has brought victory over evil. We are enjoying the occasion to the fullest,"" said Chand Ratan Chandak, a resident. ""We are happy to enjoy Holi although it is for a very short time. We are also praying for the return of peace in the town,"" said Shankar Mech. The agitating organisations, in a meeting yesterday, decided to let businessmen open their establishments, barring the 143 shops that had downed shutters reportedly to attend the meeting organised by Nibbuss. The organisations also decided to request the businessmen to stay away from anti-Assamese activities. Today, most of the shops in the market were open. They were thronged by many as people could not buy essential items yesterday. In another breakthrough, based on information provided by Bengali organisations, Dhemaji police and the army arrested Nibbuss's national organising secretary Binoy Biswas, 54, at 2.30am today from Dharmapur village, 25km from Silapathar. Biswas was found in the house of Sorbeswar Das, 45, who was also arrested. Biswas, who hails from Natun Birpur under Betua Dohori police station in West Bengal, has identified himself as an advocate of Calcutta High Court. He was one among the 21 people against whom AASU had lodged an FIR at Silapathar police station. Sanjay Das, the Dhemaji district general secretary of Nibbuss, was also arrested today. With this, the total number of arrested persons in connection with the March 6 attack has gone up to 43 while the number of persons detained for violating curfew has gone up to 111. The Dhemaji district unit of AASU today declared March 6 as a ""black day"" for Assam and the Assamese community. It said the ""failure"" of the state government to arrest Subodh Biswas, the ""main accused"", has created suspicion among them that the government was deliberately not arresting Biswas for fear that it would reveal his alleged links with the BJP and RSS. Additional director-general of Assam police Mukesh Agarwal, who is monitoring the situation, told The Telegraph: ""The situation is under control now. Today, we relaxed curfew for four hours. The duration will be increased gradually to bring normalcy."""

In some places, the protests turned violent.With Puntamba, the epicentre of the protests, remaining completely shut, Nashik, Kolhapur and Sangli were some of the other major centres where life was thrown out of gear due to the bandh.Farmers and Jai Jawan Jai Kisan activists pour milk on the road during a protest as part of the Maharashtra bandh in Nagpur on Monday;The Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMC) remained open in some places such as Pune, Solapur, Dhule and Navi Mumbai.All major APMCs from Nashik district, including Lasalgaon, Pimpalgaon and Niphad, remained closed. Life in cities across the district too was affected. Major markets in Sangli and Kolhapur were completely shut down.Farmers in Chandwad resorted to road roko on the Manmad-Chandwad road. There was also a onion-throwing protest in Yeola of Nashik district.

Milk tankers from Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara going to Mumbai via the Mumbai-Pune expressway were given Z-category security to avoid untoward incidents.In Madhya Pradesh, the 10-day farmers stir took a political turn on Monday, with the opposition Congress announcing support to the agitation. State Congress chief Arun Yadav said the Congress is aggressively supporting the agitation by the farmers and party workers have been instructed to join the crusade of the agitating farmers.Reports of farmers enforcing a shutdown in Mandsaur and looting and destroying a truck full of milk packets in Jhabua district surfaced on Monday.MP Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan launched a veiled attack on the opposition party, alleging that certain vested interests were behind the violent protests. The farmers are not at all involved in violence, its anti-social elements and certain vested interests who are behind the violence, said Chouhan. He also stressed on the need for the government to purchase agricultural produce at more cost whenever the market prices go down. The CM announced that a Price Stabilisation Fund of Rs 1,000 crore is being set up for this.While maintaining that a bumper onion crop had triggered price crash, Chouhan said the government has decided to purchase onions from farmers at Rs 8 per kg. The process has already begun in Indore, Ujjain and Mandsaur districts. Also, it has been decided to purchase moong and toor pulses at Rs 5,500 and Rs 5,050 per quintal.While the RSS-affiliated Bhartiya Kisan Sangh had called off the stir following a meeting with the CM on Sunday, other bodies like Bhartiya Kisan Union and Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh are yet to call of the 10-day long protest.Why are the two states facing trouble?Farmers from the drought-hit states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh have taken to the streets in the last few days.

But a section of farmers outfits is not happy and want loans of all 1.34 crore farmers in the state to be written off. The demand is supported by Opposition parties and the BJPs main ally, the Shiv Sena. Significantly, two influential farmers outfits, the late Sharad Joshi-founded Shetkari Sanghatana and MP Raju Shetti-led Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, have decided to jump into the agitation. Shetti is an ally of the BJP. A 21-member core committee of prominent farmers leaders in the state has been formed, which will be meeting on June 8 in Nashik to decide on a future course of the agitation.Anticipating trouble and in the backdrop of the violence in neighbouring MP on a same issue, the state governments orders that prohibit five or more people from assembling at a spot will remain in effect till June 16 in Pune, June 17 in Kolhapur and June 19 in Nashik.In Mumbai, the vegetable markets received regular supply and prices stablised on Tuesday. The rates of tomato dipped to Rs40 a dozen, while cauliflower was priced at Rs 60 a kilogram. Fruits like chikoo dipped to Rs40 a dozen from Rs120 a dozen when the strike was at its peak on Friday.In a significant development, NCP chief Sharad Pawar called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi apparently to seek his attention to the farmers agitation in Maharashtra. According to reports, Modi told Pawar that Fadnavis would take a call on loan waiver.Significantly, state governments hopes to get any assistance from the Centre to write off farmers loans suffered a setback as union urban development minister M Venkaiah Naidu, who was in Mumbai on Tuesday, categorically ruled out any loan waiver package or aid by the Centre to the state for the purpose. Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have announced loan waivers on their own and Maharashtra will have to follow the same, Naidu told reporters.In the backdrop of the agitations, Fadnavis met BJPs ministers late on Tuesday. The meeting was held to review the BJPs recently undertaken farmer outreach campaign Shivar Samwad (Dialogue with Farmers) across nearly 43,000 villages in Maharashtra, at his official residence Varsha. The review comes ahead of party president Amit Shahs visit to Maharashtra as a part of his all India 95-day campaign tour to review organisational strengths of the BJP across all states, on June 16, 17 and 18."

It has been the second year of a bumper onion crop with no buyers, forcing the government to announce a belated decision to procure the onions for Rs 8 per kilogram.Farmers are angry because the government neither made arrangements to procure the crop on time nor intervened to ensure a reasonable price. They threw onions on roads given the prices of the vegetables plummeted to as low as Re 1 to Rs 2 per kg in certain markets, especially in the Malwa region, last year. This year too, farmers had to sell their winter crop  tomato and potato  at throwaway prices, bearing heavy loss.The distress is visible in the suicide numbers. From February 2016 to mid-February 2017, 1,982 farmers and farm labourers reportedly committed suicide, which was one-fifth of the total suicides in the state, where 21,000 farmers have taken their lives in 16 years.The National Crime Records Bureau attributed the reasons to crop failure, failure to sell produce, inability to repay loans, and other non-agriculture factors such as poverty and property disputes.The farmers should have been affluent if 20% growth figure given by the government is to be believed, said former state agriculture director GS Kaushal. But, he said, the reality was that input costs were rising and government failed to ensure remunerative price.MP farmer agitation: How the crisis unfolded June 1: Farmers begin a ten-day-long agitation in Madhya Pradesh demanding better price for their produce June 4: Clashes break out between police and farmers in Sehore, Indore and Bhopal districts, leaving six policemen injured June 4 afternoon: A delegation of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), which is affiliated to saffron parivar, defers farmers agitation following a meeting with chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in Ujjain June 4 evening: Enraged by the announcement of BKS, other two major organisations spearheading the agitation - Rashtriya Kissan Mazdoor Sangh and Bharatiya Kisan Union - say agitation had not been called off or deferred.

Experts say crop failure rate in the rain-fed regions is high.The state governments zero percent interest loan benefitted some farmers. But farmers in general were not able to claim benefits again as they were not able to repay the short-term loan. This, local government officials say, pushed farmers to local money-lenders, a reason for farmers to demand loan waiver.The governments bid to improve horticulture and food processing is mainly confined to paper, leading to farmers not getting benefits, much like farm owners in Punjab and Haryana."
