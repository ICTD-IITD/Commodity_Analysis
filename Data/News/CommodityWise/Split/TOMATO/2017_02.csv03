The priest thought it looked like Ganesha and blessed it.Pattni, who sent photos of the tomato to Hindustan Times, said: It has now degenerated, but the priest said it would bring us luck and help increase business. We are lucky this tomato reached us. It seemed to have worked  we soon got big orders.He said his family was mainly involved in gold and jewellery, but he chose to use his background in catering to offer authentic Indian vegetarian sandwiches that make customers feel like you are in India.Pattni added: We do the traditional sandwiches, like the authentic Bombay, which is a three-layer sandwich with potatoes, cucumber, beetroot, cheese, pepper and a green chutney specially prepared by us.His shop is one of many in the Belgrave area offering Indian fare in a town with a large population of Indian origin. Many Indians and Asians expelled from Idi Amins Uganda in the early 1970s moved to Leicester, and have since rejuvenated local economy and culture.Some of the leading restaurants in Leicester are named Chutney Ivy, Chai Paani, Sharmilee, Bombay Bites, Mumbai Inn, The Indian Chef, Shimla Pinks and Masalas."

Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi is likely to visit the spot on Wednesday. Curfew is clamped across the district.Angry farmers have said they will not cremate the five bodies unless chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan visited the district, and have called for a strike supported by the opposition Congress. Many farmers have blocked the Neemuch-Mahu highway with the body of one deceased farmer.Last night police caned farmers who gathered at the mortuary. However, they allowed the bodies to be taken away in the wee hours. But we continue to stick to our demand that until and unless the CM visits the district, the cremation will not take place, said Patidar Samaj, Neemuch president Mahesh Patidar. All five farmers were from the Patidar community, a traditional vote base of the ruling BJP.Official sources said Chouhan didnt plan to visit the district. State BJP president Nandkumar Singh was trying to persuade the farmers to allow the cremation.It has been confirmed by the party that Rahul Gandhi will visit Mandsaur but we are yet to know about the timing, said KK Mishra, chief spokesperson state Congress.Villagers stage a chakka jam on Mhow-Neemuch highway with the body of Abhishek Patidar. (Mujeeb Faruqui/HT Photo)The firing on Tuesday came during raucous protests to demand better crop prices in the drought-ravaged region that saw one farmer suicide every five hours in the past two years.The situation is bad in the Malwa-Nimad region, which comprises 15 districts, including Mandsaur where a second year of bumper onion crops found no buyers, forcing the government to announce belated a price of Rs 8 per kilogram.Farmers are angry because the government neither made arrangements to procure the crop on time nor intervened to ensure a reasonable price. They dumped onions on roads as prices of the vegetables plummeted to as low as Re 1 to Rs 2 per kg in certain markets, especially in the Malwa region, last year. This year too, farmers had to sell their winter crop  tomato and potato  at throwaway prices, bearing heavy loss."

Before the embargo, Turkey had supplied around a half of the tomatoes consumed in Russia.""We have secured serious developments on all issues outside of tomatoes. We have shared our sensitivities on the tomato issue,"" Yildirim said.Admitting the tomato had now become a ""symbol"", he added: ""Regarding the tomato, we need more time.""Russia is keen to promote its own production of tomatoes as its seeks to diversify its hydrocarbon-based economy and develop agriculture.Quoted by Russian media, Medvedev said that the ban on Turkish tomato imports would stay in place, although all other restrictions on fruit and vegetable imports had been lifted.He said tomatoes were not included as Russia wanted to ""preserve investments made in the sector that should not come to nothing.""The November 24, 2015 shooting down of the Russian plane led to an unprecedented crisis in ties and prompted Russia to impose a raft of sanctions against Ankara.These included an effective ban on Russian package holidays to Turkey, ruining the 2016 tourism season in the country's south. That ban has since been lifted.After a reconciliation deal last year, relations have seen a rapid improvement with the two sides working together in a bid to end the Syria conflict.Erdogan had invited President Vladimir Putin to the Istanbul Black Sea summit, during a visit to Russia earlier this month. But the Russian strongman did not attend, with Medvedev representing Moscow."

Farmers across Maharashtra have been on an indefinite protest since June 1, demanding, among other things, a complete farm loan waiver, implementation of the Swaminathan Committees recommendations, an increase in the procurement price of milk and a pension scheme. The strike has adversely affected supplies of vegetables and milk to wholesale markets across the state and led to an increase in prices.On Saturday, the state government announced a farm loan waiver of Rs 30,000 crore, the biggest such write-off for farmers in the state yet. The announcement caused a division among farmer leaders, with one section of the Kisan Kranti  the umbrella organisation which led the protest  becoming the target of others who said they were not taken into confidence before the waiver was announced.In todays meeting it was decided that we will carry on with our protest and a state-wide bandh will be on June 5.

Vegetable-laden trucks under police protection entered various agriculture product market committees.There were stray incidents of violence. In Dalwat, nearly 300 protesters stopped a tomato carrying truck and offloaded its contents on the road. The mob is also alleged to have thrown stones at a police vehicle.

Every single person in the family is capable of handling biggest problems and weve always faced challenges headlong.

He never liked studies much, and he was always good at cricket. The good thing was though he would disappear for hours on end to play, he would always tell us where he was going. No sneaking away, no secrets, says eldest sister Charusheela.A 80m long rectangular pebble strewn playground  with a neat joggers walkway around it in the adjoining Lokmanya Nagar was where Kedar started his cricket. Its called the Jeet ground, though the original three-storey Jeet building facing the ground after which the tiny maidan took its name was razed down for redevelopment.

593bec567be9e04956d79822,A bumper farm crisis,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-bumper-farm-crisis/article18470885.ece,2017-05-17,"Farmers in some States are regretting their abundant yields this year as the prices of agricultural commodities have crashed. Chilli farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, tomato growers in Karnataka, and toor dal cultivators in Maharashtra are at the centre of a severe crisis that has witnessed prices fall by more than half in a matter of just weeks. Some speculate that high commodity prices last year caused farmers to respond by boosting production, which in turn led to the present price crash.Whether it is the wholesale mandi s where farmers sell their agricultural produce, or retail outlets where consumers buy them, price fluctuations are common. But whether such fluctuations can be explained as being due to mindless crop cultivation, as some speculate, is not as certain. For one, in the consumer market, commodity speculators usually dampen price fluctuations by managing supply according to consumer demand. For instance, when the supply of grains is abundant, speculators do not flood the market with all their stock but instead hoard the grains and sell them later when supply turns scarce. Thus, even if farmers engage in mindless grain production, speculators usually save the day for consumers by preventing steep rises and falls in grain prices.Price fluctuationsSecond, in the wholesale market, speculators can save farmers from similar price fluctuations by paying a competitive price for their produce even when there is abundant supply. Grain traders, to return to our previous example, who want to hoard supply expecting higher grain prices in the future would be willing to pay a better price to farmers today. This comes not out of compassion for farmers, but purely out of competition with other grain traders. When farmers are free to sell their produce to any trader they want, it is traders paying the best price who get hold of it. Farmers can also expect a more predictable price for their produce each season, reflecting stable consumer prices, thus preventing mindless cultivation.Such competition though is precisely what is missing from the Indian agricultural scene where the supply chain is broken. Red tape, including limits on stocking agricultural products, has prevented the growth of a robust market for commodity speculation. The result is lack of investment in infrastructure like that of cold storage; about 40% of agricultural produce in India is wasted because of it. This, in turn, has led to price fluctuations that have affected both the farmer and the consumer. Wholesale agricultural prices are determined by trader cartels that block competitive bidding. This significantly reduces the price farmers can get for their products, while boosting the profits of some privileged traders. By some estimates, farmers receive only 20-25% of what the final consumer pays for his product. Thus, a free market in agriculture can be the best antidote to the crisis facing Indian farmers."
