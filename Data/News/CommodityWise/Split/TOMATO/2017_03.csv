However, Microsoft said they had pioneered digital agriculture applications that included a sowing application for farmers in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh that advices them on the best time to sow based on weather, soil, and other indicators. Mr. Kammardi said the commission had already developed an interactive digital dashboard, which collects real-time data on prices of agriculture commodities from the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees across the State.We alert the government if the prices are falling below the cost of production or the minimum support price so that intervention can be made whenever necessary, he said. The same data has also been used to conduct a price forecast analysis of three to six months based on an advanced econometric model in consultation with Lalith Achoth, who heads the Department of Diary Economics and Business Management at the Dairy Science College in Bengaluru.An attempt had been made to forecast prices of a total of 25 agricultural and horticultural commodities in the Perspective and Forecasting report submitting to the State government by the commission in December 2016. We had predicted a collapse in prices of tomatoes in the State in the report, he said.The price projection, he said, was based on one variable  price of a commodity prevailing over the last couple of years. The commission is planning to join hands with technological companies like Microsoft to develop software for forecasting of prices of commodities based on multiple variables, including weather, soil, supply, area under cultivation of the commodity, among others, he said. Prediction will be more precise if multiple variables are considered, he added.Mr. Kammardi said there was a need for the farmers to be aware of the supply position of the crops they are growing and the price forecast region-wise.The commission was working towards a State level comprehensive production policy for agricultural and horticultural crops keeping in mind food security needs, local demand, supply of raw materials to industry, and export to foreign countries.Alongside, a suitable crop plan needs to be formulated at the district level in association with farming community keeping in mind the climate, market, and State production policy."

Chandrababu Naidus plan to popularise and promote traditional and authentic Andhra cuisine internationally has sent a team of the Tourism wing on a delicious trail of identifying and moderating to add nutritional value to the most authentic traditional dishes, some of which are on the verge of extinction.A team led by Andhra Pradesh Tourism Authority (APTA) Joint Director Sudha Kumar, a culinary expert, is currently engaged in identifying and perfecting healthy recipes.There are some not-very-popular traditional recipes with the health factor intact in them. Ingredients such as pounded rice, organic vegetables and fresh local raw components add that extra flavour to Andhra cuisine, says Mr. Kumar and cites the example of a unique idli -making practice in Ambajipet of Konaseema region. It is called Pottikkal. Fermented idli batter is wrapped in jackfruit leaves in the shape of a cone and steam-cooked. The aroma of jackfruit leaves enhances the flavour of the idli , lending the dish a unique touch, explains Mr. Kumar, informing that the pyramid idli served with ulavacharu (the concentrated extract of horse gram) is very healthy.Method of cookingLeaves and flowers of drumstick, jackfruit and amla which have medicinal value, are also being brought into use. Method of cooking and use of traditional utensils like brass vessels and earthen pots, not seen much these days, is yet another focus area.The recipes thus culled out will be referred to a team of nutritionists for their expert advice and endorsement besides roping in an ayurvedic doctor to present his point of view on the identification of medicinal value of each recipe.After consulting with some of the top chefs in Hyderabad, Mr. Kumar and his team have identified about 30 recipes in different categories.AppetisersIn the appetisers section are delicacies such as Nalleru kada vada (vada made with the stem of Nalleru, a medicinal plant) and kobbari kudumulu (coconunt dumplings): under main course, mulaga puvvu thalimpu (tempered drumstick flower) and arati puvvu-pesara kura (banana flower-green gram curry); cereals- menthe kura-tomato annam (fenugreek leaves-tomato rice) and dampudu biyyam pesara molakala pulao (pulao with hand-pounded rice and green gram sprouts); pulses- Chintha chiguru pappu (dal with tender tamarind leaves) and in the non-vegetarian category dosakai mamsam (meat with yellow cucumber) and sora puttu (a fish delicacy).The team members are on an elaborate exercise of standardising each of these recipes for taste, texture, yield and nutritional balance. The cooked samples will be sent to the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibrating Laboratories (NABL) to evaluate the amount of carbohydrates, proteins and based on their feedback, the recipes will be further modified if need be.The final details of the recipes will take the form of a book that will be printed and published for public use. The Tourism Authority also plans to host food festivals across the country and cookery contests in the State.We can embrace healthy food with simple tips. Substitute use of sugar with brown sugar, palm jaggery or fruit syrups. For example, Kakinada khaja can be made using sugar syrup made with pineapple juice, banana juice or strawberry juice, he says. Eliminate deep frying which absorbs more oil and take to concealed way of cooking (dum style of cooking). Use more of ingredients like yellow pumpkin, raw banana flowers and stem, drumstick leaves, methi leaves and cow ghee."

The campus was decked up as though for a festival, but this one was with a purpose.The Garden City Farmers inaugurated their exhibition-cum-workshop Oota From Your Thota at St Josephs Girls High School in Fraser Town to raise awareness on the importance of organic terrace gardening among students and gardening enthusiasts. The event promoted gardening on terraces and balconies for urban dwellers who crib about not having space to grow plants in their homes.The programme revolved around the idea Grow what you eat and eat what you grow. Vegetables such as tomato, green chilli, cabbage, bitter gourd, drumstick and greens can be grown on rooftops. Even fruits such as grapes and sapota can be grown with the pruning method which helps the plant bear fruits even when it is not growing vertically.Dr B N Vishwanath, president, Garden City Farmers, said, I will not stress on the word organic because it is has lost its meaning. People have started calling anything and everything organic. I would rather say that we need to try to grow plants naturally in the best possible manner.As many as 68 different stalls were put up to showcase different types of enterprises related to organic terrace gardening.Accessories such as high densitypolythene bags which can be used as makeshift flowerpots instead of heavy concrete flower pots, seeds of flowers and vegetables, pots made of coir and sprinklers with timers were also available.N Ramakrishnan (65), a resident of Basaveshwaranagar, who has been growing plants on his rooftop for five years, said, The quality of the vegetables and greens that you grow by yourself is very different from what you get in the market. You can feel a difference in the taste. Ramakrishnan has grown vegetables such as tomato, brinjal, French beans and all kinds of greens.Anitha, a resident of Shivajinagar, was intrigued by the idea of using vegetables which could be grown in the garden. She said, I never knew we could grow vegetables like drumstick and cabbage on terraces. I am surely going to try it in my house. The workshop which was conducted has been helpful to know the proper procedures.The programme was inaugurated by BBMP corporator Abdul Rakeeb Zakir who announced that he would request the Horticulture department to allot a space of 20,000 sq ft near Coles Park in Fraser Town to Garden City Farmers to encourage their initiative."
593c71f57be9e00ed19a34eb,Opinion| Farmer protests:&thinsp;Rewrite the rules to stop this cycle of agrarian dist...,http://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/farmer-protests-rewrite-the-rules-to-stop-this-cycle-of-agrarian-distress/story-ahjhxzLpA2CtCSRTOjVUHM.html,2017-06-08,,Hindustan Times,"The farm protests in Madhya Pradesh that left five people dead this week is symbolic of a wider agrarian distress engulfing India. Farmers are demanding loan waivers and remunerative prices for all crops, many of them encouraged by Uttar Pradeshs decision to write off loans given to small farmers. The governments of Maharashtra and Punjab, where the protests are spreading, have rightly resisted because loan waivers only offer relief that is usually exhausted in two farming seasons.The cardinal malaise lies in successive governments treating agriculture as a source of votes and not an engine of growth. That kept the rural-urban wage gap wide at 45%, almost four times that of China, and shrunk the share of farming in GDP to under 14%, although more than half of Indias 1.25 billion people still depend on it.To be sure, India is reforming parts of its economy. But not farming. If farmers are to escape poverty, farming needs to become more like manufacturing: Teched up operations, free as far as possible from imponderables, churning out quality produce that fetch the right price.For this, things need to change. The old, labour-intensive methods must give way to technology for efficiency and higher yield; Pricing and subsidy mechanism must be overhauled; and, most importantly, India must look at fewer people farming.For far too long, farming has been at the mercy of nature, especially the June-September monsoon rain. The use of technology is patchy, and only one-tenth of every rupee the government spends on rural areas goes to improving productivity  which is why farmers in India grow 46% less rice an acre than their Chinese counterparts.Our farm subsidy policy encourages the production of only low-value staples, such as rice and wheat, and the output of fruits and vegetables  that more Indians are eating and farmers producing  is not covered by the governments minimum support price. Much of the farm distress sweeping India now stemmed from a glut of potatoes, onion and tomatoes.Worse, the monopoly of traders over local agricultural markets is perpetuated by law, which bars farmers from selling directly to consumers. This kills any chance of farmers getting a fair price, lining the pockets of commission agents instead.In the past, a single season of dry spell was enough to send the economy into recession. Now failed monsoons trigger localised distress. Thats an improvement. Still, far too many farm households remain too poor. And unless the rural economy is unshackled from a time and policy warp, our dream of double-digit economic growth will remain just that: A dream."
593c72507be9e00ed19a35ba,Why a bountiful harvest drove farmers to despair and anger,http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-a-bountiful-harvest-drove-farmers-to-despair-and-anger/story-Z4Tv0RSb49s9ANWv2OIP7L.html,2017-06-08,,Hindustan Times,"A plentiful harvest in 2016 and imports drive some prices down 63%. A shortage of cash because of demonetisation. Despite Rs 3.5 lakh crore  enough to build 545 Tehri-sized dams  invested over six decades to 2011, more than half of all farms depend on rains. These are the three factors agitating Indians who depend on farming  90 million families, or 54.6% of Indias 1.2 billion people.As anger sweeps rural Madhya Pradesh after the death of six farmers in police firing, farm protests roil rural Maharashtra -- wholesale markets are shut, produce is being dumped on streets -- and governments of the debt-ridden states struggle to respond to demands for loan waivers, an IndiaSpend analysis and reportage from rural Maharashtra explores why farmers are both angry and desperate.The primary reason farming is unviable in India is that farms are now among the worlds smallest (the global average land-holding size is 5.5 hectares)  too many people are dependent on shrinking farms.Since 1951, the per capita availability of land has declined by 70%, from 0.5 hectares to 0.15 hectares in 2011, and is likely to decline further, according to ministry of agriculture data.Such small and marginal land-holdings, as they are called, now constitute 85% of the number of operational farms in the country, according this 2015-16 report on the state of Indian agriculture.It is hard to use modern machinery on small farms, the owners of which are often too poor to afford farm equipment. Manual labour increases costs, but labour too has been in short supply, as workers migrate to cities. Further, their size and output limits access to loans and institutional credit.Those are the larger issues. Here are the three reasons for the current turmoil, gleaned by IndiaSpends analysts and reporters:1. After back-to-back droughts, a good harvest, but incomes fallAs 2017 rolled in, the news from Indias farms appeared good.After droughts in 2014 and 2015, a good monsoon in 2016 reversed two years of rural economic decline. Indias agricultural growth contracted 0.2% in 2014-15 and grew no more than 1.2% in 2015-16, because of the back-to-back droughts. In 2016-17, the agricultural economy grew 4.1%.Across many states growing pulses, such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Gujarat, markets were flooded with produce, especially tur (pigeon pea), which witnessed the highest growth among all pulses, an important source of protein for a majority of Indians. India is the worlds largest pulses producer.However, an influx of pulses from Myanmar, Tanzania, Mozambique and Malawigrowing 20% over two financial quarters, from September 2016 to March 2017, the Business Standard reported on March 3, 2017caused the price of Indian tur to plunge.From Rs 11,000 per quintal (from December 2015), the price of tur fell 63% to Rs 3,800-4,000 per quintal  20% below the minimum support price (MSP)the price at which government buys farm produceof Rs 5,050 per quintal (including a bonus of Rs 425) since December 2016 as Indiaspend reported on April 12, 2017.The table above explains how production of pulses rose 29%, from 17.15 million tonnes in 2014-15 to 22.14 million tonnes in 2016-17. Tur production increased 50%, from 2.81 million tonnes to 4.23 million tonnes, over the same period.The MSP for tur should be increased to Rs 6,000 per quintal in 2017 and Rs 7,000 per quintal in 2018, a government committee headed by chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian recommended in September 2016.As on March 2017, the minimum support price for tur was Rs 5,050 per quintal, nearly 20% (18%) lower than the prices recommended by the committee on pulses.As these prices crashed, farmers found it harder to find money to store their produce and prepare for the next season because demonetisationthe withdrawal of 86% of Indias currency, by value, on November 2016 left them starved of cash.2. How demonetisation  and government red tape  left farmers short of cashOn May 18, at around noon, 30-year-old Prashant Lande waited under a harsh summer sun to sell 800 quintals of tur at the Amravati agricultural produce market committee (APMC), 664 km east of Indias financial capital, Mumbai.From Kinhala village in Amravati districts Ashti taluka, in Maharashtras eastern region of Vidharbha, Lande said he refuses to sell his 800 quintals of tur to the government procurement centre, although the state buys tur at a higher rate.At the market, Lande could sell his tur at Rs 3,800 to Rs 4,000 per quintal, while the government buying centre offered Rs 5,050 per quintal.We dont sell to the government centre because the process of selling takes one month  from standing in line for the token to the sale to finally when the payment reaches the account, said Lande. Our fellow farmers who have sold their produce at the procurement centre on March 22, are yet to receive their payments and it is nearly June!It does not help that the effects of demonetisation continue to to be felt across the rural economy.Right after demonetisation, tomato farmers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, and onion farmers in Maharashtra and Gujarat, were the worst hit as prices fell by 60-85%, IndiaSpend reported on January 18, 2017.With little respite more than six months later, the experiment has aggravated the circumstances leading to the current farmers strike.By now we should have begun preparing our fields for the monsoons, but because of demonetisation and the unavailability of cash, we are still struggling to find money for sowing, said Lande.At such a time, farmers like Lande turn to credit.Up to 57% of farm families in Maharashtra are indebted; the figure for India is 52%, according to the National Sample Survey Organisations 2013 situation assessment survey of farm households, the latest available data.This indebtedness has widespread consequences. More farmers committed suicide in Maharashtra (4,291) in 2015 than any other state, rising 7% from 4,004 in 2014, followed by Karnataka (1,569) and Telangana (1,400), as IndiaSpend previously reported in January 2017.Now, after Uttar Pradeshs new government waived Rs 30,792 crore of farm loans, pressure is building on the governments of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to do the same. Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has been reluctant to do so, but with his governments coalition partner, the Shiv Sena, and other parties preparing for a political agitation, he may find it hard to exercise fiscal prudence.3. In an era of climate change, 52% of Indian farmers without irrigationThe basic problem across most of rural India is that despite the spread of irrigationa sector plagued by unfinished projects and corruption52% of Indias farms still depend on the vagaries of rain, which is becoming increasingly uncertain in an era of climate change.Extreme rainfall events in central India, the core of the monsoon system, are increasing and moderate rainfall is decreasing  as a part of complex changes in local and world weather  according to a clutch of Indian and global studies, as IndiaSpend reported on April 15, 2015.The droughts of 2014 and 2015 in rural Maharashtra were mitigated by the plentiful rains of 2016, but many parts of the state also endured floods. Uncertain weather affects the ability of government extension systems to provide accurate advice to farmers.The government encouraged us to grow more tur in the kharif (July to October) season, since these crops consume less water and are in high demand, said Lande, the Vidarbha farmer. We would not have faced so much loss over the last three years, had there been a proper system of canals.Despite six decades of irrigation, less than 50% (or 66 million hectares of Indias net-cultivated area of 140 million hectares) as irrigated, according to the 2015-16 State of Agriculture report. Groundwater provides water for two-thirds of Indias irrigated land, but those levels are falling from overuse.From the first five year plan (1951-56) to the eleventh (2006 to 2011), the central government has spent a total of Rs 3.51 lakh crore, as we said, on major irrigation and flood control projects characterised by time and cost overruns, shows this 12th Five Year Plan (2012-2017) report.On July 1, 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY)or the Prime Ministers Farmers Irrigation Programmewith a budget of Rs. 50,000 crores over five years (2015-16 to 2019). The motto of the PMKSY is Har Khet Ko Pani (water to every field) and More crop per drop.In 2015-16, less than a third (Rs 312 crore) of Rs 1,000 crores set aside for micro-irrigation was released, reveals this government report. Of this, upto April 2016, no more than Rs 48.3 crore, or less than 5%, was actually spent, according this micro-irrigation financial progress monitoring report. The government set Rs 1,763 as the 2016-17 micro-irrigation target, but no data on results have been released.The micro-irrigation programme covers an area of 6,51,220 hectares, or 0.46% of net cultivated area.(Salve is an analyst with IndiaSpend.

But as soon as the sun sets, and the food is served, everyone is smiling and chatty. Eyes suddenly light up with gratitude and glee. You can hear some banter on one table and a child screaming with joy on the other.However, even if you arent fasting, rest assured that the lip-smacking food found in the hidden pockets of this area, abuzz with restaurants dishing out their signature preparations, will make your mouth water. Heres a glimpse of what to expect on your Iftar trail.Shami Kebab and Chicken HakimiNoor Mohammadi, Bhendi BazaarBhendi Bazaar is a busy nightspot through the year. Its especially busy during Ramzan. And the largest crowd is usually gathered at Noor Mohammadi, waiting to break their fast with falooda, fruits and some lip-smacking Shami Kebab (Rs 20). Made with minced chicken, chana dal and spices, the kebab is hand-pound to a texture so soft that it is hard to lift them without having them fall apart. Another specialty here is the Chicken Hakimi (Rs 500), essentially tandoori chicken soaked in a thin liquid concoction of buttermilk, chaat masala and butter.Bheja, Kaleji or Gurda MasalaBa-Barkat, Nagdevi StreetHere, your choice of meat, bheja (lamb brain), kaleji (lamb heart) or gurda (lamb kidney; Rs 180), is pound with some oil, tomatoes, onions, chillies and lemon juice to form a dish that has the consistency of egg bhurjee.Bhel Bara HandiSurti, Bohri MohallaLocated a stones throw away from Tawakkal Tandoori Chicken, Surti is famous for its Bara Handi, and sees huge crowds during Ramzan. The dish acquires its name from the 12 vessels that traditionally have different types of pulse-based gravies, each containing a different cut of mutton or tenderloin. The one served at Surti, however, is a banquet of seven gravies. While each of the gravies can be had by itself, a dish called the Bhel (Rs 150), which combines all the different gravies, is also served here. The ensuing gravy is a union of mutton, dal and garam masalas.Aab GoshtCafe Nizari, Bhendi BazarDunk some pillowy and slightly sour pav (Rs 7) into a bowlful of rich fiery mutton stew (Rs 70) primarily prepared with gram lentil, tomatoes and onions.Baida RotiMastan Talao, Nagdevi StreetA meal in itself, the Baida Roti (Rs 100) found at Nagdevi Street, is an Iftar must-have. A thick layer of minced keema or chicken is sandwiched between two hot and fluffy flour-based rotis that are coated with egg.Chicken TandooriTawakkal Tandoori Chicken, Nagdevi StreetThe Chicken Tandoori (Rs 110) served at the buzzy stall located on Nagpada Street is another local legend. Juicy and tender pieces are coated with a marination of your choice. The three varieties of tandoori are chicken malai (marinated in creamy yoghurt, ginger, garlic and chilli), hariyali (coated with a paste of coriander, mint leaves, ginger, garlic and lemon juice) and the regular chicken tikka masala.Reshmi Special MalpuaBadri Mithai, Nagdevi StreetWatching Reshmi Special Malpua (Rs160) being made is almost hypnotic. Batches of dough, prepared with maida, sugar, saffron, milk, cardamom, semolina, etc., are dipped in a vessel of hot oil and fried till the outsides of the dough turn golden brown and crisp. The resultant is a steaming hot pancake that leaves you with a saccharine aftertaste the entire night.

Many a restaurant has been lost to the siren call of this beautiful bungalow at the start of Worli Koliwada.Its a beautiful space. A long corridor leads to a bar, the third of four parallel, pale-olive-green rooms, each with a distinct character. The bar is buzzy, the attached lounge sedate and intimate. The outer eating area has the relaxed air of a drawing room; the inner ones dominant long table is reminiscent of a dining room.Slink and Bardot describes itself as a French-themed restaurant serving modern-day Parisian cuisine. The menu embraces international dishes, ingredients and flavours as enthusiastically as classic and contemporary French cuisine. Its not too different from modern Indian, an equally rootless cuisine that draws on, and sometimes combines, local and global tastes.The eating areas at Worlis Slink & Bardot are intimate, relaxed and a nice contrast to the buzzing bar section. (Aalok Soni / HT Photo)At Slink and Bardot the cheese plate contains British, Spanish and Swiss cheeses, and a French one produced in India. The charcuterie platter is made up entirely of Italian meats. Along with a Salade Parisienne, is an American Caesar, Spanish gazpacho and Nordic gravlax - all made with Indian ingredients.They only serve small plates. Our cocktail arrives first; the gin-based Sitting in an English Garden Waiting for the Sun, served in a long-stemmed martini glass, is the equivalent of a slinky dress, but the cucumber juice drowns out the other flavours.A standout dish at Slink & Bardot is the tomato and mozzarella tart. Sweet, skinned tomatoes and gooey mozzarella come stacked on a thin, crushed-Parmesan, biscuit-like base. (Aalok Soni / HT Photos)The food seesaws between mundane and extraordinary. The panko-crusted popcorn chicken, essentially glorified McNuggets, are too salty, and the three dipping sauces are an indistinguishable blur of textures. Our chicken parfait is smooth and creamy and spread beautifully on bread crisps; the stars on the plate, though, are the crisp pickled vegetables.The complexity of the tomato and mozzarella tart leaves us breathless.

Government health officials participated in the meeting.Outlawing momos, however, would accomplish little.The substance at the root of Aroras claims, monosodium glutamate (MSG), also known as the brand name Ajinomoto, is frequently used in the preparation of dishes with East Asian flavouring such as noodles, fried rice, chilly paneer, and chilly chicken.The flavour enhancer is also naturally found in vegetables such as potato, tomato, and mushroom, as well as several fruits and wheat and dairy products. It is added into a variety of grocery items.MSG came to the limelight in 2015 when samples of Nestles Maggi were found to include the flavour enhancer despite Nestles claims to the contrary. Maggi was also shown to have higher than permissible quantities of lead.India does not stipulate a maximum limit of MSG in food. The Food and Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) requires that it should be used in accordance with a general set of good manufacturing practices and only in certain types of food.To help people make an informed choice about what they eat, the FSSAI also says that food items that do contain MSG must announce its presence on their packaging.What is MSG? Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) is a flavour enhancerIt is commonly found in Chinese food, soy sauce, parmesan cheese, potato chips, and frozen foodsIt also occurs naturally in items such as potatoes, tomatoes, milk, mushrooms, and wheatThough consumption in large quantities may cause headaches, numbness, chest pain and sweating, and eventually lead to elevated blood pressure, it is still basically safeCan it really cause cancer?It is popularly believed that MSG causes sluggishness, headaches, nausea, increased thirst, skin rashes or excessive sweating. Scientific studies around the world, however, have failed to establish any negative health impact associated with MSG, let alone cancer. The Food and Drug Administration, the premier regulatory body of its kind in the United States, categorises MSG as generally recognized as safe.If consumed in higher quantities or regularly, it is also known to have caused palpitations and chest pain in some people, said Ritika Samaddar, chief dietician at Max Super Speciality Hospital. It is an approved flavour enhancer; even the US allows its use. We just suggest that as a precaution, pregnant women and infants not consume it.It definitely does not cause cancer, she adds."

This recently launched eatery is the equivalent of your friendly neighbourhood caf, and food here is just simple, but full of flavour.With a bar on the roof overlooking Ulsoor Lake, this also makes for the perfect setting to grab a few drinks with your friends on a rainy evening in Bengaluru.Just like any other caf, the pizzas, burgers, sandwiches and pastas are your best bet here. We especially loved the Goan Sausage Pizza, which comes with a thin, crunchy base and is loaded with meat. The Pork Belly Panini and the Grilled Tenderloin Burger are sure to get your hands messy, but are packed and will fill you up in no time.If burgers and pizzas are not your speed, try the Spaghetti with Prawns, Sundried Tomatoes and Fennel - it comes with a light parmesan broth, and the prawns are large, juicy and cooked just right. For the die-hard meat lovers, the Tenderloin Medallions with Mashed Potatoes is an excellent option - big on both size and taste. Handed to you with a rich pepper sauce, this dish goes perfectly with their Baby Spinach and Watermelon Salad or the Quinoa Salad which are light and refreshing.For desserts, do make sure to check out the counter to see what theyre offering that day. Their Lemon Meringue Pie and Eton Musk Sundae are great ways to end your meal.For those with an inkling towards all things chocolate, the Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Pie and Cookie Dough Skillet are good options. We particularly enjoyed the Coconut Tres Leches, a light, fluffy dessert that isnt too high on sugar content.While the cocktails are mainly your run-of-the-mill sangrias and mojitos, there were two on the menu that really stood out for us. The Smooth Talker, with whiskey and cinnamon as the main ingredients, tastes like a comforting, alcoholic apple pie that your mom bakes for you when youre feeling low. The Mr Felix is another cocktail worth trying if youre in the mood for something fresh and citrus-y, as its bursting with lemongrass and kaffir lime leaf flavours.However, with crowd-pullers like Tao Terraces and Yauatcha on the same floor, its hard to tell if Caf Felix will be able to match their popularity in the months to come."

My travels have been no different!Sojourns across South-east Asia have left an indelible impression, influencing both, my style of cooking and menu planning. Interestingly, South-east Asian cuisine comes with a whole lot of unsuals. Consider the concept of serving in bowls, whereby the bowl serves as a complete meal in itself!By virtue of expediency and exquisiteness, the Vietnamese Pho, Burmese Khowsuey and Singaporean Laksa, all bowl meals, have reached tables of leading restaurants across the globe.Another lasting gastronomic influence in my life came from my five year stint in the beautiful Maldivian islands, where I picked up the art of contrasting flavours, textures and temperatures. I had the pleasure of tasting a local specialty - a yellow fish curry served with rice and crisp drumstick leaves. The taste and texture of the meal linger on, and have, in fact, become the basis for a whole lot of innovations.One such dish on our menu, which, in the true sense is a culmination of these learnings, is the Hu-Tieu-Sai-Gon!Hu tieu (spiced noodle soup) is a traditional Vietnamese dish specific to southern Vietnam. This bowl meal is a perfect balance of spiciness from chilies, sweetness from jaggery, sourness from tamarind and the crunch from fried peanuts! To prepare Hu-Tieu- Sai-Gon, make a stock of fresh veggies along with spices such as garlic, star anise, ginger, cinnamon and chopped lemongrass and bring to a boil. Strain the broth and put back on the boil. Add a homogenous mix of coconut milk, peanut butter, mushroom oyster sauce, light soy to the broth.For the toppings, use blanched vegetables and cooked rice vermicelli in boiling water for not more than a minute. To assemble, add boiled rice vermicelli in a soup bowl. Top it up with the blanched vegetables, crispy onion and garlic slices. Pour the boiling broth over this and serve alongside shredded lettuce, sliced tomatoes, sprouts, basil leaves, chilli and lime wedges.Like all my journeys, thus far, I wish to continue the exploration of the myriad nooks in this world that lead me to less travelled culinary havens and ultimately to the discovery of life itself.

Being a homebound person by nature, I spent a lot of time in the kitchen helping my mother. Our food needs a lot of whisking, and she would ask me to stir the curries. She taught me how to make kibbeh, a mixture of finely ground lamb or beef, bulgur, onion, mint and Middle Eastern spices, which we would stuff in fish or lamb and fry, says Alshamali. The 35-year-old chef in the midst of launching a modern Middle Eastern cuisine eatery at the Renaissance Downtown Hotel, Dubai is in Mumbai to helm the ongoing Arabesque food festival at the J.W. Marriott Juhu.When we meet Alshamali, the Lotus Caf is pleasantly enveloped with the pleasing fragrance of zaatar and cinnamon. Middle Eastern food is similar to Indian food as most of the ingredients are similar, shares the chef. The food that Alshamali is dishing up for Arabesque is more home-style making it an authentic Arabic experience on a platter.On the menu is an authentic shawarma station. Alshamali is serving shawarmas with a special red chilli paste he has brought all the way from Syria. From the grill section, we try chicken in harissa sauce, prawns in a green souk sauce made from coriander and chillies. While the ingredients are easily identifiable, they create a completely unique zing on our palates. We quite enjoy the mild chicken cooked in yogurt with saffron.Past the grill section, which also has crunchy baby corns, green chillies and baby aubergines,we take a dollop of kabsa, rice with minced meat and meatball in tomato sauce made with pomegranate molasses, kokum and sumac, which gives the dish a berry-like sourness.The chef, whose earlier stint has been at Qbara, a modern Middle Eastern restaurant that made it to Worlds 50 Best Restaurants this year. He says, My first job in Dubai was in Atmosphere, the highest restaurant in the world housed in Burj Khalifa, where we served authentic French cuisine.He breaks down Arabic cuisine to the basics. Tahina is made from roasted sesame and harissa, a sauce made from Magrebi red chili, Moroccan spices and garlic, are the most commonly used. We also make a fine green zouk sauce which has coriander, green chillies, caraway seeds and lemon juice. We use pomegranate molasses and cumin too in our curries, he adds, sharing a childhood memory of his mother pickling vegetables for winter months. She would put the olives in brine solution for two months before we could eat it, he smiles.Our order of the shawarma is here, and we roll the pita bread that is stuffed with grilled chicken, the Syrian red chilli paste, lemon juice, onions. We dunk it in sour cream and the sweet and tangy red chilli paste pleasantly surprises us. While it is not at all spicy, it is supremely flavourful.Alshamalis version of a bakalava takes us into a food trance. Its freshly made and comes with a twist. It has no pistachio but a filling of walnut with cinnamon. It is flaky and soft and we are likely to crave this version more than the traditional pistachio one.The Arabic Food Festival, Arabesque at JW Marriott, Lotus Caf from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. daily till April 30"

But what has come as a reprieve was that the prices of essential veggies such as onion and tomato, had stayed below Rs 30 per kg.Summers usually see rise in vegetable prices due to water shortage and decreased arrivals of produce. Traders say that almost all supplies to Chennai are coming from other States and hence the transport cost adds to the vegetable prices. They say the prices have been on the rise for last one week.In the wholesale market at Koyambedu, onion, which was sold at Rs 12 per kg, is now sold at Rs 17. Tomato and potato, which were sold at 15 per kg, are now sold at Rs 25 and beans sold at Rs 60.Sales are dull. When the cost is high, people tend to buy less; they buy something like half kg instead of 1 or 2 kg. But, only when we increase the prices we get decent profit, says Badriswamy, vegetable vendor, Koyambedu.Traders say most of the vegetables and fruits are transported from neighbouring States such as Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. In such cases, the cost of production and transportation falls on the vendors and traders and as a result, price rise happens and burdens the buyers.This is the case every year. Vegetables and fruits are very essential. Demand will always exist, but sometimes it is not met with sufficient supply. Hence the price rise to which Ive clearly reconciled myself, says Rathna.In Aminjikarai market, prices are at peak. Brinjal is sold at Rs 80 per kg and tomato at Rs 30. A sack of onion, earlier sold at Rs 400, is now sold at Rs 800 and 1 kg onion is sold at 20 kg. Carrots and beans are sold at Rs 70 and Rs 80 per kg, respectively.I buy minimum of all vegetables as the prices are high. My budget for vegetables for a week is Rs 100, says Allabakash."

593c79bf7be9e00e964d2780,The ultimate price: Should what you pay for tomatoes matter?,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/the-ultimate-price-should-what-you-pay-for-tomatoes-matter-4611009/,2017-04-12,,Indian Express,"Photo for representational purposes. Photo for representational purposes.This is the time of the year when as temperatures rise with the summers onset, so do prices of most vegetables. Its a phenomenon as predictable as the fall in prices that accompany lower temperatures during the winter months.A good example is tomatoes, which are currently retailing at around Rs 16 per kg, as against an average range of Rs 8.5-12 during November-January. In all likelihood, prices will firm up further over the next couple of months. Last year, they averaged almost Rs 45 in May, over Rs 56 in June and eased somewhat to Rs 30 in July, before collapsing to below Rs 10 per kg in August (see chart).These wild price oscillations have largely to do with natural, occasionally untoward, factors determining availability. Tomatoes are usually a 120-125 day crop, which start yielding fruits after 75 days, with production happening in flushes. There can be up to ten flushes in any given crop cycle, each following the previous one in four-five days intervals. Although tomatoes can be grown year-round, the water stress during summers means plantings mostly happen in June-July (with the monsoon rains), October-November and January-February. Arrivals pick up from mid-August onwards and peak over the winter.The above irregular supplies are further exacerbated by tomatoes being perishable and not amenable to storage, unlike potatoes or onions. The result is that prices fluctuate hugely during any year, with consumers having to especially pay much more in May-June-July, when crop availability is very poor.When prices of any vegetable go up, there is a natural outcry from consumers. But whats often not realised is that an average household consumes a basket of fruits and vegetables (F&V). While prices of individual items may go up, what matters ultimately for the household is how much it pays for the entire basket during any given month.Thus, even though tomato prices go up with dwindling supplies in the summer months, this does not hold true for other vegetables such as bhindi (okra), kheera (cucumber), lauki (bottle gourd), tinda (round gourd), tori (sponge gourd) and chichinda (snake gourd). You get all these cheaper in summers because of increased availability, which is also the case with mangoes (the King of Fruits), watermelons, sweet lime (mosambi), lychees, plums, peaches and cherries.In the same chart displaying the swing in retail tomato prices since January 2016, we also have the average per kg rate for the entire monthly F&V basket consumed by households. This price  based on the average value of F&V purchased by our consumers at Bigbasket.com  turns out to be relatively uniform and stable. Our consumers paid between Rs 43 and Rs 60 per kg for the average F&V item, which is quite different from shelling out anywhere from Rs 8.5 to Rs 56 for a kg of tomatoes.If overall price stability is what counts, we shouldnt worry much if individual items within the entire F&V basket cost more during certain months. Moreover, prices become an issue only when they go up. Spare a thought for the poor farmer, including the one growing tomatoes. Last August, prices crashed to levels where production costs could not be recovered. In November and December also, a bumper crop, coupled with the sudden demand shrinkage due to demonetisation, led to farmers destroying their standing crop in the field. But that did not bother us much.Price stability is eventually not just about consumers. Its also about farmers. Without a mechanism to ensure enough remuneration for the farmer to feed and take care of his familys essential needs, he will be in no position to produce to meet our consumption requirements. The farmer should be entitled to a reasonable annual income increment, just as we look forward to during this time of the time. A four-five per cent yearly increase in our average F&V spend shouldnt be too much for us to bear.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

This was the first visit of the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) leader to the Charotar region of central Gujarat. Hardik, who also faced protest banners here, symbolically picked up a fistful of soil from the home of Sardar Patel.WATCH WHAT ELSE IS IN THE NEWSFlanked by PAAS supporters, Hardik arrived at Karamsad on Thursday evening, three hours behind schedule and headed straight to the house of Sardar Patel. Amid chants of Jai Sardar, Jai Patidar, he picked up a fistful of soil from the premises and declared his well-rehearsed vow. He said, I will fight for the Patidar community in Gujarat and for all other communities of the country. In any part of the country, where the dream of Sardar Patel has remained unfulfilled, either of farmers or any other communities, I shall fight for their right as this is a very important matter for me. I swear by the soil of this holy place.After spending about 15 minutes inside Sardar Patels house and looking through a collection of his belongings and photographs, Hardik told mediapersons about the protests against him. The BJP youth wing, armed with rotten tomatoes, eggs and black flags, greeted Hardik as he entered Karamsad. Several banners with a photograph of Sardar Patel, purportedly put up by the residents of Karamsad read in English, Hardik Go Back.Hardik said, It is the right of people to oppose. We are opposing the government and the BJP is opposing us. But no one from Sardar Patels family has opposed the movement. Today, as a shoe was hurled at the state Home Minister, it is natural that BJP workers will be agitated. But Im very happy to be here today.Local PAAS leader Ravi Patel said that in the days to come, the group plans to carry forward the agitation to the rural areas of the district.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Here, vegetables grow all-round-the-year, thanks to Ambothi,60, a revolutionary farmer, who uses waste water from houses in the village to keep his land green and fertile.Ambothi says it was his son, A Selvan, who came up with the idea to use waste water from homes, which is always available, to irrigate their one-acre land, after rearing of crops became difficult due to the failure of monsoons. ""I decided to try growing crops with the water that is discharged from homes, water that is used for washing, bathing etc, but not toilet discharge,'' says the farmer.Five years ago, he convinced the villagers to allow him to transfer the grey water from their homes to his land, for which he laid a pipeline for a distance of about one kilometre. Ambothi spent about Rs 1lakh to lay the pipeline and construct two 20 x 20 foot tanks, which are 15 foot in depth, to store the water. The farmer uses water from about 450 houses in the village.The water is collected in the two tanks, which fill up to the five foot mark every day. It is then then pumped with the help of an electric motor. ""The water that flows out is clear as the sediments settle down,"" he says.""I have been cultivating various crops, including tomato, brinjal, chilli, ladies' finger and various types of gourds according on the season as water is not a problem for me. I have been been reaping better produce than earlier,''says Ambothi, while adding that he uses fertilizers like potash only during the early stages of cultivation and that the use of chemicals is minimal.Palanisamy, a villager, says that he had at first ridiculed the idea, but is now awestruck to see the results. ""The vegetables grown here also appear to be more colourful and big,'' says Palanisamy. Meanwhile, the people are also happy as the waste water is drained away from their homes daily, and they don't have to bear the stench or suffer the menace of mosquito breeding."

(Express File Photo: Mayur Bargaje)After a 10-day gap, auctions in 305 Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs) across Maharashtra finally resumed as farmers, who had been staging an agitation, decided to bring their produce to the markets. The core committee of agitating farmers, which met in Nashik on Thursday, had conditionally decided to resume agriculture supplies to the APMCs.The immediate impact was a sharp reduction in vegetable prices in the markets. At the Nashik APMC, a 20 kg crate of tomato that fetched Rs 200-250 10 days ago, before the strike started, was now selling at Rs 100-150. We are now afraid that the massive glut in the market, will lead to a massive fall in prices hitting farmers further, Neelesh Kor, a trader from Nashik APMC said.Many farmers had been expecting that due to the massive shortage over the past few days they would end up getting decent prices in the market. However, many of them returned disappointed. Before the strike, a bunch of 10 cauliflower heads would sell for Rs 100 to Rs 150 but on Friday, the price was between Rs 40 and Rs 50.We are scared of how long these prices will fall. We suffered over the past few days because we could not bring the produce to the market. Now we are suffering as the prices have fallen, Vishnu Sonawane, a farmer from Dindori, said. We have started the auction. Farmers suffered quite a bit during the strike as they would not bring the produce to the market. Over the past 10 days, traders were going to farms and picking up the produce. We hope that normalcy will get restored in the next few days, Jagdish Apsunde, a trader at the Nashik APMC, said.The core committee of farmers, while deciding to resume agriculture supplies to APMCs, had, however, laid down an ultimatum stating that if the state does not hold a meeting with the committee in the next two days they will hold sit downs before all government offices on June 12 and stage a rail and rasta roko across the state on June 13. The Committee has also stated that from Friday, it will not allow any minister in state government to hold any kind of function in the state.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

(Representational Image) The Pune Market Yard has seen vastly improved supplies, which have brought down the prices significantly. (Representational Image)Prices of vegetables in both wholesale and retail markets in urban areas such as Pune and Mumbai have seen large scale correction, bringing much-needed relief to consumers. Prices of almost all other fresh vegetables, barring garlic, have come down by almost 30-40 per cent, as the markets reported increased arrival.Earlier, the week-long farmers strike had crippled the supply of vegetables across major wholesale markets in the state. Farmers had refused to trade their produce at the markets and had also taken to the streets to stop the supply of such commodities to urban centres. The price of fresh commodities, including vegetables and milk, had gone up by a whopping 40-50 per cent between June 1-8 across the state. While the supply had improved towards the last few days of the strike, most of the supply of fresh produce was from outside the state.The Pune Market Yard has seen vastly improved supplies, which have brought down the prices significantly. As against the traded price of Rs 4,000 per quintal of June 2, tomatoes traded at Rs 600 per quintal on June 9. Similarly, for okra, prices have dropped from Rs 6,000 per quintal to Rs 3,000 per quintal. Onion prices have also seen a slight dip, from Rs 1000 to Rs 850 per quintal. Supplies have improved in Vashis wholesale market, with more than 600 trucks of vegetables arriving in the market on Saturday.Suresh Pingle, president of the Vegetables Traders Union of the market, said prices of almost all vegetables ranged between Rs 10-20 per kg. The drop in prices at the wholesale markets have resulted in a similar trend in retail markets. Vishnu Salve, president of the Pimpri retail market, said prices of most commodities had dipped by 50 per cent. However, garlic prices remained high, as supplies were hampered due to the ongoing crisis in Madhya Pradesh.

593cf0757be9e00e964d44ac,Fields of unrest,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/fields-of-unrest-4695442/,2017-06-08,,Indian Express,"There is a clear pattern to the farmer agitations currently on in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. To start with, they seem to be concentrated in the relatively more prosperous agriculture belts  the stretch from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune to Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur in Western Maharashtra and Neemuch, Mandsaur and Ratlam in MPs Malwa region. Farmers here grow a range of commercial crops. They are also largely from progressive agricultural communities such as Marathas and Patidars. These farmers  unlike their brethren in drought-prone Marathwada, Vidarbha or Bundelkhand, who are largely into subsistence agriculture, and often resort to seasonal migratory employment  have seen good times, particularly through the first decade of this century till about 2013. This was a period of remunerative prices for most crops on the back of a global agri-commodity boom and domestic demand fuelled by rising incomes.The first setback to the above party came towards mid-2014, with the collapse of world commodity prices, leading to both falling exports and rising imports of farm products from the country. The current crisis, however, has to do more with domestic headwinds that may have some link with demonetisation. In virtually every crop marketed since November  whether soyabean, green gram, pigeon-pea and potatoes or tomato, onion, garlic, red chili, fenugreek, grapes and pomegranates  farmers have experienced huge price declines. The government claims this is mainly due to bumper production. But there is also a demand side. Produce trading in India is predominantly cash-based. The body blow this traditional agro-commercial capital has suffered due to demonetisation  and the inability of formal finance to fill the gap  may explain the apparent lack of liquidity in the markets now. With nobody really to buy and stock up, the speculative capital that used to buoy commodity prices has practically ceased to exist. And its farmers who have taken the ultimate hit.This situation is unsustainable, both politically and economically. But the solution cannot lie in farm loan waivers. Indebtedness is only the symptom of the actual disease, which is one of low prices and demand for produce. What the farm sector desperately needs is liquidity, which can come from institutional finance, modern agro-processing and organised retail, both domestic and foreign. While a zero GST rate on most primary farm produce is a welcome move, it needs to be supplemented with the removal of all restrictions on stockholding, domestic movement and exports. There is also a case to impose higher import duties, especially on pulses and edible oils, as a temporary measure. If there can be anti-dumping duties and minimum import prices on steel or float glass, why not for products from the farm  more so, in todays troubled times?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

A sales ban has exacerbated losses, as the military fears profits are funding insurgent activities.In recent weeks, the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) donated 30 tonnes of early-maturing, pestresistant seeds to Borno's farmers.But IITA coordinator Kamai Nkike said three consecutive rainy seasons have been missed and the current season, which began two weeks ago, is also likely to pass without crops being planted.""Farming in northern Borno at the moment is practically impossible,"" said Nkike. ""The farmers want to be on their own.They are not happy with food aid."""

The delicate skin has fewer oil glands compared to other areas and is constantly exposed to the suns harsh rays and other chemical concoctions like harsh soaps and detergents. Plus, our hyaluronic acid decreases with age, leading to pigmentation, prominent veins and thin skin. This process starts in your mid-20s but becomes evident in the early 40s.Care for your hands as you do your faceExposure to water, cleansers, hand sanitisers, dry weather, long hours in air conditioned environments affect your hands. But with a little care, you can remedy the situation. Firstly, moisturise as much as possible. Whether you are sitting in your car or in your office, always keep lotion handy. As for the men, while strong hands might be appealing, callused ones certainly arent. So use a hand cream too but just dont borrow one from your partner. Sonia Sharma, Spa Manager at Taj Salon, Vivanta by Taj - President, Mumbai, advises purchasing formulas meant for men as their skin tends to be thicker. While doing the dishes, use gloves to avoid contact with harsh detergents. Swap harsh soaps for gentle hand washes with pH levels between 5.5 to 5.7.Dr. Neena Chopra, director, Beauty and Technical, Just Herbs (an e-store for organic and ayurvedic luxury skincare) has simple advice. She urges you to use the same anti-ageing products meant for your face, on the backs of your hands. Massage it in to improve circulation and then slip on thin gloves before bed. Also, a hand mask once a week delivers an intensive dose of hydration to your skin. Dr. Renita Rajan, a consultant cosmetic dermatologist, offers a quick home-care facial for the hands. Lather up a gentle cleanser and add some brown sugar to the mix. Use the concoction to gently scrub the skin until the sugar dissolves. It will exfoliate your skin without being unduly harsh.Of course, never forget sunscreen, even for your hands. Dr. Neeraj Tulara, specialist internal medicine at Dr. L H Hiranandani Hospital, Powai says, Just like the rest of your skin, your hands are vulnerable to damage from the sun, including dark spots that can make them look older. To protect them, Tulara says to regularly apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher reapply often. And if theyve gotten sunburnt, a paste of fresh tomato juice will reverse the damage.Pay attention to your potionsDr. Jamuna Pai, celebrity cosmetologist at Blush Clinic, Mumbai, advises being smart about your hand products. Whilst selecting your moisturiser, check the labels for key ingredients such as hyaluronic acid, niacinamide and dimethicone, besides urea, glycerine and shea butter as these will replenish the moisture that the environment takes out from your skin by pulling the water from the inner layers of your skin to the surface. Aloe vera, vitamin E oil, mango butters, also work well to soften and heal your hands. Dr.Chiranjiv Chhabra, director and consultant dermatologist at Skin Alive, recommends using a product with retinol at night since it has great anti-ageing benefits and stimulates collagen production.If you want to go beyond homecare, Dr. Apratim Goel, cosmetic dermatologist and laser surgeon, Cutis Skin Studio, Mumbai, suggests trying out the new Helios-II fractional laser, which works wonders on shrivelled hands and removes age spots and tanning. Filler injections containing hyaluronic acid like Juvederm, Restylane and Meso Infusion can also be given to moisturise the skin from within, she says.Give your hands, a handThe age-old offenders like smoking and drinking will sap your skin of any moisture. Load up on good ol H20 because dehydration can affect your hands badly. A good well-balanced diet rich in vegetables, zinc and fatty acids will contribute to soft skin. Dr. Maithili Kamat consultant dermatologist at Jaslok Hospital & Research Centre, tells her patients to keep a stress ball handy as squeezing it not only helps release tension but also helps build the muscles of your wrists and hands."

REUTERS/Ari Jalal Members of Iraqi rapid response forces and a member of federal police gather next to a tank during a battle against Islamic State militants at the Bab al-Tob area in Mosul, Iraq, March 14, 2017. REUTERS/Ari JalalIraqi government forces killed the Islamic State commander of Mosuls Old City on Tuesday as the battle for the militants last stronghold in Iraq focused on a bridge crossing the Tigris river. As fighting intensified on Tuesday after the previous days heavy rains, civilians streamed out of western neighbourhoods recaptured by the government, cold and hungry but relieved to be free of the militants grip. IS snipers were slowing the advance of Interior Ministry Rapid Response units on the Iron Bridge linking western and eastern Mosul but the elite forces were still inching forward, officers said. Government forces also pushed into areas of western Mosul, Islamic States last redoubt in the city that has been the de facto capital of their self-declared caliphate.Watch what else is making news:Federal police killed the military commander of the Old City, Abu Abdul Rahman al-Ansary, during operations to clear Bab al-Tob district, a federal police officer said. With many IS leaders having already retreated from Mosul, Ansarys death comes as blow to the militants as they defend their shrinking area of control street-by-street and house-by-house. Capturing the Iron Bridge would mean Iraqi forces hold three of the five bridges in Mosul that span the Tigris, all of which have been damaged by the militants and US-led air strikes. The southernmost two have already been retaken. We are still moving toward the Iron Bridge. We are taking out snipers hiding in the surrounding building, we are still pushing for the Iron Bridge, Brigadier General Mahdi Abbas Abdullah of the Rapid Response force told Reuters.Near the Mosul Museum, Iraq forces used armoured vehicles and tanks to attack snipers pinning down troops clearing areas around the bridge. An air strike targeting one Islamic State position hit a building, engulfing nearby troops in smoke and dust. Since starting the offensive in October, Iraqi forces with US-led coalition support have retaken eastern Mosul and about 30 percent of the west from the militants, who are outnumbered but fiercely defending their last stronghold in Iraq. For much of Tuesday, the troops were within 100m (330 feet) of the bridge. Its very key for our forces to secure the riverside and prevent Daesh militants from turning around our advancing forces, a Rapid Response spokesman said in the morning, using an Arab acronym for Islamic State.They expected to gain control of the Iron Bridge and the nearby area by the end of the day, he said. Seizing the bridge will help further tighten the noose around Daesh fighters entrenched inside the old city, he said.HEAVY SHELLINGThe boom of shelling and heavy machinegun fire could be heard from the centre of Mosul and helicopter gunships strafed the ground from above on Tuesday morning. Amid the combat, a steady stream of refugees trudged out of the western districts, carrying suitcases, bottles of water and other possessions. Some pushed children and sick elderly relatives in handcarts and wheelbarrows. Soldiers packed them into trucks on the Mosul-Baghdad highway to be taken to processing areas. Most left in the dark early morning hours or after the army recaptured their neighbourhoods. Food had been scarce, they said. We fled at 5 a.m. (0200 GMT) after the army had arrived. There has been a lot of shelling by Daesh, said Hamid Hadi, a teacher. Mostly weve been eating water mixed with tomatoes.Ashraf Ali, a nurse who escaped with his wife and two children, said mortar rounds were falling as they fled. They took advantage of the army retaking their district to get out. Daesh wanted us to move to their areas but we escaped when the army arrived, he said. As many as 600,000 civilians are caught with the militants inside Mosul, which Iraqi forces have effectively sealed off from the remaining territory that Islamic State controls in Iraq and Syria. The Iraqi forces include army, special forces, Kurdish peshmerga and Shiite militias.More than 200,000 Mosul residents have been displaced since the start of the campaign in October. The Ministry of Immigration and Displacement said on Tuesday that in recent days, almost 13,000 displaced people from western Mosul had been received seeking assistance and temporary accomodation each day. Whenever we advance there are more people coming out, said one Iraqi officer directing refugee transport. There are more people on this side of the city and people are trying to leave because there is no food and no supplies in their area.Losing Mosul would be a major strike against Islamic State. It is by far the largest city the militants have held since their leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed himself leader of a caliphate spanning Iraq and Syria from a mosque in Mosul in the summer of 2014.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

While the situation in the Maoist-hit district is slowly improving, its district headquarters mirroring a well-kept small town and Maoist influence being largely pushed into the jungles of Bijapur, Sukma and Narayanpur, senior police officers still identify Katekalyan as a problem area.Yet, Katekalyan has quietly been building another identity  as the nursery of organic farming mushrooming across the district, where farmers have come together to set up a company to market their produce across the country.Gonelu Ram is one such farmer. It isnt paddy season yet, so the crop is assorted  tomatoes, peas, chana and mustard. Standing in front of his lush green fields, he beams as he reels off their names, and then adds an important note. All this is completely organic. The fertlisers I use are what nature gives Cow urine, neem leaves, bitter gourd leaves and besharam patta. My produce has never been better before 90 per cent of Katekalyan has now returned to completely organic farming, he says.Watch What Else is Making NewsTill about five years ago, Ram, like most other farmers across Dantewada district, was caught in a dilemma. Organic fertilisers and indigenous seeds were part of the knowledge passed down to farmers for generations, but the administration, looking at agriculture as a way of reaching out to people in a conflict zone, was sending a different message. The crops that were pushed were homogenous high-yielding varieties that worked best with chemical fertilisers.These high-yielding seeds and the fertilisers were not suited for the microclimate. There was good yield for a while, but the soil soon became unresponsive and it killed the ecosystem around it. There were no fish in the ponds or earthworms in the ground. Now, the district administration is returning to organic methods, and wants to make Dantewada a completely organic farming district, says Akash Badave, who was a PMRDF fellow in Dantewada and has since been working on agricultural improvement in the district.The Indira Gandhi National Agricultural University records 22,000 different varieties of rice found in the state, most unique to it. And Dantewada is no different. Badave says that while no exhaustive study has been done so far, a 10-village sample survey revealed 35 different varieties of rice, with differences in gestation of crop ranging from 60 days to six months.The most important thing is that these communities have known these varieties for a generation, and each has different properties. There are many types of rice that have medicinal qualities, some that are given to lactating mothers, others for joint pain. Then there are millets such as Kosa, which are in high demand elsewhere but are unique to Bastar, he says.The return to traditional farming, with a few tweaks, began during the kharif crop of 2013. The district administration began the process of teaching farmers systems of rice intensification, which included tips like ensuring space between two stalks.The method was used to show that despite no use of fertilisers or high-yielding seeds, productivity could still be high. In 2013, 300 farmers adopted it, and their produce increased three to four times. Now, there are over 2,000 farmers, and 170 small groups of farmers have been formed to go around the district and tell others about the benefits of organic indigenous farming. Its a peer review system, with these groups looking at fields and certifying whether the produce is organic or not, says a senior government official.Those involved in the process realised that the system wouldnt work if there was no market to sell to. So, on August 26, 2016, the Bhumgadhi Organic Farmers Company Limited was set up to package and sell the unique Bastar produce across the country. It has since expanded to include 370 farmers. Each farmer pays Rs 1,000 to buy a share in the company, which in turn buys organic produce and uses state-aided technology to improve the seeds. In the next month or so, district officials plan to procure a processing unit with storage godowns.The administration is incurring some expenditure, but there will be no interest, and the money only has to be paid back in 10 years, by which time the company will have grown. The term Bhumgadhi, fittingly, means the post-harvest festival of prosperity, says Badave, who is the CEO of the company.Dantewada District Collector Saurabh Kumar says they are in touch with buyers from across the country. We are in talks to sell our produce in stores all over the country, such as Udaipur, Chandigarh, and especially in South India where the demand for our produce is very high. We are attempting to fill the vacuum of an available market, he says.A few kilometres short of Katekalyan, on the road from the district headquarters of Dantewada, some residents of Gatam village sit and listen intently to a small team that talks about the producers company. Eighty-six of them belong to an extended family, and they laugh when they are asked to confirm that number. All of us are related, one way or another, and live in one part of Madkampara village, says one of them.But the large family isnt the only thing that is striking. Amid a large swathe of brown, their fields are glistening green. Three big containers are filled with organic fertilisers, made from the waste after the droppings from the mahua tree are converted into local alcohol.Asked if they will be a part of the farmers company, one of them answers: Kucch accha ho raha hai Karenge, hum karenge (Something good is happening we will take part).For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Source: Debabrata MohantyON MARCH 3, a physically challenged tribal farmer, Siba Bhatra of Sanamasigaon village in Odishas Nabarangpur, had lunch at home just after noon and walked towards his paddy field about half a kilometre away. Sibas wife Sanadi was away attending the marriage function of her nephew in another village, while his father Banamali was at home.Around 3 pm, two neighbours saw Siba lying unconscious near a cashew tree next to his field with a 100-ml bottle of Lethal Super pesticide lying beside him. After undergoing treatment for four days, Siba, 47, a father of two sons and two daughters, died in the Nabarangpur district headquarter hospital on March 7.With Sibas wife and residents of the village claiming that he was stressed over his inability to provide for his family, the death has once again highlighted concerns over farmers suicides in one of Indias poorest districts.Watch What Else Is making NewsThe death comes more than a year after five farmers committed suicide within a span of 30 days between October and November 2015 in this southern Odisha district. And, it follows two more deaths of farmers in Odisha this month, including one in Chief Minister Naveen Patnaiks Ganjam district.On Saturday, T Bulu Reddy of Chikarada village in the Golanthara block of Ganjam consumed poison after untimely rains destroyed his tomato and chilli crops, said officials. Reddy, who had taken a loan of Rs 1 lakh for farming and Rs 1.5 lakh for the treatment of his ill son, consumed poison on the night of March 10, they said.Days earlier, another farmer Khainu Bagarti, 55, consumed poison in Kendapalli of Bargarh district in the west, after his crop of chilli, cauliflower and other vegetables failed due to lack of water, said his family. The government has directed the district collector to conduct a field investigation.Nabarangpur is the focus of an ongoing assignment by The Indian Express, titled District Zero, in a zone ranked at the bottom rung of the development ladder based on several indicators, such as literacy and healthcare.Nabarangpur tehsildar Akshay Khemundu acknowledged that Siba had taken loans worth over Rs 48,000 for his farming needs over the last four years, but cited an inquiry report prepared by local officials to argue that this may not have been the reason for the suspected suicide. And officials said that compared with 2015, when Nabarangpur suffered a drought, 2016 was a good year for farmers.He had taken a loan of Rs 35,000 in 2013 from the Sanamasigaon branch of Utkal Grameen Bank, of which he paid one instalment. Similarly, he took a loan of Rs 13,150 from LAMPCS (Large Scale Adivasi Multi-purpose Cooperative Societies) in 2014, but had not paid any instalment. He was never issued any notice either by the bank or the cooperative society, said Khemundu.There are also murmurs in Sanamasigaon about domestic discord in Sibas home, which Sanadi denied. He rarely spoke and never fought with me But he used to drink a lot, said Sanadi.Nilambar Satpathy, managing director, LAMPCS, Nabarangpur, said Siba had taken a loan of Rs 13,150 in July 2014 for farming, including Rs 4,650 for fertiliser, at an annual interest rate of two per cent. The same was to be repaid in one single instalment at the end of one year, failing which the interest rate would mount to 12 per cent. Bhatra had not paid any money till the end of July 2015, said Satpathy.The branch manager of the Utkal Grameen Bank did not respond to The Indian Expresss request for comment.Sanadi said she did not know the details of her husbands financial condition, except that he got Rs 3,600 as disability allowance every year. But it was difficult for the family to earn even Rs 100 a day, she said.Though struck with polio, which had affected both his legs since childhood, Siba used to till his share of land with the help of neighbours.Sanadi has an Antyodaya card through which the family gets 35 kg of rice at Re 1 a kg every month. But it was barely enough for the family. My husband and I used to work as agricultural labourers or household workers in others homes or fields, she said.Sanadi said poverty forced their two sons Gopal, 15, and Dhanurjay, 8, to drop out of school while one daughter Urmila works as a help in a schoolteachers home in Berhampur town. Kaushalya, the second daughter, is the only one in the Bhatra household still in school and now studies in Class VII.Officials said the government has given Rs 15,000 as ex-gratia assistance to the family from the Chief Ministers Relief Fund and District Red Cross fund. They also insisted that the death could not be attributed to crop failure, as there was no standing crop in his field.But Sibas death continues to haunt Sanamasigaon. No one saw him buy the pesticide. There is no pesticide shop in our village. He must have bought it from Nabarangpur town, said his neighbour Banamali Bhatra.

I had cultivated tomato on a two-acre plot and invested Rs. 2 lakh. Now, at the time of harvest, the rates have crashed, said Nagarajappa, a farmer in Mallasandra, Kolar taluk. I am going to suffer a loss of a minimum of Rs. 1.5 lakh, he said.Currently, tomatoes are being cultivated on an estimated 9,850 acres of land across Kolar district.Most farmers are struggling to get the produce into the market, and they feel it is not worth the effort. We are not even able to cover the cost of labour and transportation, K.M. Nagaraj of Srinivasapur taluk said.Varying pricesThe lack of standardisation in prices is also cause for concern.For instance, a 15 kg box fetched only Rs. 25 at Srinivasapur APMC yard on Saturday, which is less than Rs. 2 per kg. However, at Kolar APMC, the rates were marginally better: a 15 kg box was going for anywhere between Rs. 50 and Rs. 60 (about Rs. 4 per kg) on Saturday.Only a month ago, tomatoes fetched on an average Rs. 150 to Rs. 200 for a 15 kg box, which is around Rs. 13 per kg. Farmers were relatively happy with this price.A farmer can reap profit only if they get at least Rs. 300 per 15 kg box. The government should come forward to provide relief to the farmers, said P.R. Suryanarayan, president, Karnataka Prantha Raitha Sangha district unit, Kolar.Price variations are forcing farmers to leave tomatoes to rot in the field. Dumping of tomato on the roadside has become a common scene in the district.However, while there is a glut in the market as more farmers have taken up tomato cultivation, the slump in demand in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu is being seen as the main reason for the crash in price. Farmers in these two States have cultivated tomato on a large scale resulting in lesser demand for Kolar tomatoes, claimed farmers."

(Express Photo by Abhinav Saha) Red Fort in New Delhi. (Express Photo by Abhinav Saha)A new study of global pollution shows that Indias air is the worst in the world (www.stateofglobalair. org/data). Masked Delhiites, caught in a relentless shroud of smog, have no choice but to inhale copious amounts of particulate matter. Somewhere, a quiet realisation has sunk in that the way we live is not safe. This awareness has led to a shift, with the thinking urban citizen attempting to make substantial changes to his own environment.Since 2015, we have planned over 250 balconies, terraces and small garden patches in the NCR, says Kapil Mandavewala, 36, proprietor of Edible Routes, a specialised garden solution company. They offer quite a range  from vegetables to oxygen-generating plants, and creepers. Based on a large patch of land in Ghitorni, originally an artists collective where Vivan Sundaram has his studio and Bharti Kher is a co-owner, a walk through the garden is full of revelations on design and natural ecosystems: cabbages and broccoli grow together in chaos while tomatoes are surrounded by fragrant basil.This is called companion gardening. The basil repels insects naturally and increases the tomato yield, explains Mandavewala. While his clients in highrises prefer to grow herbs, he has encouraged some of them to try growing patches of cabbage, onion and garlic as well. There are interesting looking flower pots that one is unlikely to spot elsewhere, with white pipes embedded in the mud. Mandavewala explains that the biggest quandary of the apartment dweller, who works and travels, is not being around enough to water the plants.Once you top these pipes with water, the pot can go for a month without watering as the moisture releases into the soil slowly, he says. Edible Routes has pots with a nutritive mix of mud and manure made with a machine bought from a design student in Ahmedabad.After returning with a science degree from the US in 2008, Mandavewala began tilling his familys 22-acre farm in Gujarat and supplying vegetables to a few families in Jamnagar. A chance invitation from an NGO, Manzil, for a workshop on urban gardening led him to set up shop in Delhi in 2014. He took a 14-day course on permaculture, a system of agricultural and social design principles implemented by learning from nature. Applying it to an urban context came with its own challenges: the way light falls in a highrise, in a vertical slant, may not be conducive to all vegetables and oxygen-generating plants.A special focus needs to be given to seepage and drainage of water. It took me a while to understand urban spaces and explain to the clients as well that every space is capable of cultivating something, says Mandavewala. For one home, he introduced Malabar spinach called poe saag as a vine, a popular variation of spinach down south but rarely grown in Delhi. In another, a family grew tori along their border walls.The clients, meanwhile, are mostly enchanted by their gardens. The joy of growing and cultivating your own food, knowing what youre consuming, is something else, says Mandavewala, adding that many of them begin with being terrified at the idea of taking care of several plants. One of the ironies of urban India is that farm land is acquired by people who dont know how to farm; the ones who know want a job in the city, in an office.A consultation with Edible Routes can cost anywhere between Rs 5,000 and Rs 1 lakh, depending on the material cost, area and charges for executing the project.

VENKATACHALAPATHYC_VENKATACHALAPATHYBuying vegetables may no longer be easy on the pocket, at least for the next two months, say traders. The rates of many vegetables have skyrocketed over the last few weeks in town.According to traders, the prices of many vegetables steadily increased during April.While the prices of onion and tomato continue to be low comparatively, the cost of brinjal, beans and carrot have shot up. The rates have peaked as there is no yield resulting in poor supply to markets in Vellore, A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam.The cost of the local variety of brinjal, thorny ones, has been rising in the last one month, he said. It was priced Rs. 15 a kg earlier. The rates steadily increased during April and are now priced Rs. 80 a kg. The regular variety of brinjal costs Rs. 30 to Rs. 40 a kg.As for beans the price went up from Rs. 15-Rs. 20 two months ago to Rs. 80 now. The price of carrot rose from Rs. 10 to Rs. 50, Mr. Balu said.Ladys finger is selling at Rs. 15-Rs. 30. Beetroot too has become costlier  from Rs. 10Rs. 15 it has gone up to Rs. 40.Onion and tomato offer some solace to consumers. Onion sells at between Rs. five and Rs. 12 a kg, and tomato at Rs. 10.The rate of tomato continues to be low when compared to other vegetables, as there is yield during summer in parts of Andhra Pradesh, he added.Potato costs between Rs. 15 and Rs. 20; small onion between Rs. 30 and Rs. 40; drumstick Rs. 20; green chillies Rs. 20; snake gourd between Rs. 25 and Rs. 30; bitter gourd between Rs. 20 and Rs. 30; and ginger between Rs. 30 and Rs. 40.Cost cuttingMr. Balu said, Already, people have started cutting down the purchase of vegetables due to the spiralling cost.Those buying a kg earlier are now purchasing  of a kg.Those who buy four kinds of vegetables prefer to purchase just one or two varieties, he said."

An abundance of the produce has led to a crash in prices, dashing the hopes of farmers.While farmers in Kolar, Karnataka, dumped tomatoes on the road after the prices collapsed to a new low of Rs. 2 per kg last week from Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 a month ago, violent protests broke out in parts of Telangana after a good yield of the commodity in the two Telugu-speaking States brought down the prices from a high of Rs. 10,000 per quintal last year to a measly Rs. 2,500 this year.In Maharashtra, the demand for tur, which rode a wave of high prices last year, plummeted after its production went up from 4.44 lakh tonnes in 2015-16 to 20.35 lakh tonnes in 2016-17. So was the case of grapes after a crash in their prices plunged the vineyard owners across the State into despair.While most farmers complain about the poor remuneration for their produce in comparison to the prices that prevailed in the previous season, agricultural economists have traced the reasons for the glut and the resultant price crash to the cobweb phenomenon.After the prices of a particular agricultural commodity shoot through the roof during a season of scarcity, farmers resort to boosting the production on the premise of the pre-existing demand and prices, leading to a problem of plenty, reasoned Dr. R.S. Deshpande, former Director of the Institute of Social and Economic Change (ISEC), Bengaluru, explaining the cobweb phenomenon.Most of the agricultural products that have now suffered a price crash due to their abundance had yielded a rich dividend in the previous season.Chilli woesA long duration crop, consuming up to eight months for harvesting, red chilli cultivation was expanded in both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh this year after the commodity commanded a good price last year.However, in the absence of minimum support price for the crop, categorised as commercial, the market dynamics of demand-supply kept the price low from the beginning of arrivals in the market this season from April first week. As the top quality red chilli yielded a price of even Rs. 13,000 per quintal last year, the farming community had hopes of good returns this year too, a senior Telangana Agriculture Department official told The Hindu . But, it was not to be. The Centre has, however, announced a market intervention plan to procure 33,700 tonnes out of the 7 lakh tonnes produced in Telangana with a support price of Rs. 5,000 per quintal and assistance of another Rs. 1,250 per quintal for other expenses.The crash in the prices of grapes not only soured the expectations of the vineyard owners in Maharashtra, but also claimed the lives of at least two farmers.Few takers for grapesThe suicide of 36-year-old Manik Randive and 25-year-old Chetan Vasal, both from Nashik, has been attributed to the poor price their grapes fetched.Despite a robust grape production, there were few takers as the prices had collapsed. According to Shriram Gadhave, president, Vegetable Growers Association of India, wine manufacturers are contending their stocks are full. The average input cost per acre of grape was Rs. 3 lakh. Yet farmers were selling their produce at barely Rs. 2 lakh, he said.According to him, in April last year, more than 95% of the grape harvest was plucked by wholesalers and wine-makers from farmers gardens.Farmers even received a decent rate of Rs. 40-42 per kg. This year, barely 75% of the picking had been completed while the average rate was a paltry Rs. 8 a kg.Dent in tur pricesTur dal, which hit the headlines last year with its skyrocketing prices, has suffered a dent in its demand this year after large scale production. In Maharashtra, production of tur went up from 4.4 lakh tonnes last year to 20.35 lakh tonnes during 2016-17, bringing down the prices by a huge margin.The total purchase by the government through its agencies at a Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs. 5,050 per quintal was only around 4 lakh tonnes while another five lakh tonnes had been sold at rates lesser than the MSP through the Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMC). Several lakh tonnes remain unsold.But, even during the season of scarcity, rarely do farmers benefit. For instance, even though a consumer paid almost Rs. 220 for a kg of tur dal last year, the farm gate price was just Rs. 45 to Rs. 50, said Dr. Deshpande. Does it take Rs. 170 to convert whole tur to edible tur dal, he wondered.Echoing Dr. Deshpandes views on the cobweb phenomenon, Mr. Srinivas, a progressive farmer from T. Narsipura near Mysuru, said he gave up tomato cultivation this year as many farmers began growing the vegetable on a large scale in the region after it realised a good price.( With inputs f romLaiqh A Khan in Mysuru, B Chandrashekar in Hyderabad, Shoumojit Banerjee in Pune and Alok Deshpande in Mumbai )"

Traders, who had been traditionally conducting business at the location, were caught unawares when they were asked to go back by the Corporation authorities. A section of them gave vent to their anger by spreading out tomatoes, ladies finger and other vegetables on the road.Movement of vehicular traffic was obstructed for a while.

In spite of the bumper crop in the face of lingering drought conditions, the produce has no takers from the northern States, thanks to the boom of tomato farming in Rajasthan and parts of Madhya Pradesh, a sudden phenomenon this year.The Madanapalle tomato market, which caters to farmers in over 20,000 hectares in several villages, records 800 tonnes daily during summer, while nearly 70% of the fine varieties invariably reach Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, UP, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. Till last year, the first round of auction would be for the export qualities.Farmers of this region could hardly realise that their produce would become unwanted. For those who do not know things other than tomato-growing and selling and the ambiance of the local market yard, it was news that Rajasthan, the most arid zone in India, also could grow tomatoes, and the farming is slowly spreading downward into some parts of UP and MP.Latest on Thursday, the fine quality tomato was sold at Rs. 4 a kg  the lowest ever this season  as against Rs. 9 last year. Last week, the price stood at Rs. 8 a kg. Threat of further fall even to a rupee or even less looms. The farmers draw solace from the local market pundits who predict fall of arrivals from Rajasthan from the last week of May. They can resume their exports then.Agriculture Market Committee (Madanapalle) chairman Ratakonda Gurappa Naidu told The Hindu that tomato farming had picked up by leaps and bounds in Rajasthan in the last two years, and the stage had now reached a point of exports from there. Till last year, we used to supply tomatoes to northern States in hundreds of tonnes daily. Now, our advance is checked by the Rajasthans sudden boom. The farmers there halted our exports, and we are not going beyond Chhattisgarh, that too in urban areas. The exports fell from over 600 tonnes a day to a meagre 200 or even less now.Perishability factorHe said compared to the southern variety (of Madanapalle), the Rajasthans produce was fast perishable. The produce ready for harvest cannot last longer than three weeks, whereas the Madanapalle variety can sustain up to three months, he said.The market chief, who had studied the exports pattern for a decade, said tomato farming would fail to sustain heat beyond 38 degrees. This is why Madanapalle with its cool climate round the year became the evergreen tomato producing zone. This is for the first time in the local farming history that a northern State has started to threaten domestic farming here, Mr Gurappa Naidu said."

The tomatoes are usually marketed through the daily market functioning in Vazhappadi town.The wholesale traders from Salem, Namakkal, Villupuram and Cuddalore visit this market and procure tomatoes in the auction. There is a spurt in the production of tomatoes this season, leading to bulk arrival in the Vazhappadi market.Due to this, the price of tomatoes has nosedived for the past few days.The price of a box of tomatoes weighing 25 to 28 kg is priced at a paltry Rs. 100. The price is very much on the lower side, the farmers say adding that they will not be able to meet even the expenses involved in raising the crop.Andi, a farmer of Maniyarkundam village, said that farmers managed to raise the crop overcoming heavy odds due to the drought conditions. But the poor price was a matter of shock to them.The fall in the price of tomatoes was unprecedented and tribal farmers were suffering heavy financial loss, he said and demanded the State Government to take steps for providing adequate compensation to compensate the loss."

A procurement official said that most farmers had shifted to the perennial Kiran variety, creating a huge demand for the Namdhari variety that continues to enjoy widespread patronage among consumers.The supply of beans and carrots, too, has fallen drastically over the last three weeks. Prices have crossed the Rs. 100 per kg mark even in the wholesale market.A kg of haricot beans is trading at Rs. 105  Rs. 135 in the wholesale market.

The UNI canteen on Rafi Marg was a particular favourite of mine. We used to live in the building next to that of the news agency, so breakfast often meant a plate of idli with sambar and chutney at UNIs open air canteen. Some afternoons I used to stroll down there for a plate of lemon rice or curd rice, pickle on the side, and evenings meant a plate of besan coated potato fries or a crisp vada.The PTI canteen, on the side of the road from where we lived, was not that exciting. I did go there now and then, and had a dosa or some upma, but the fare at the UNI canteen, we all agreed, was far better.Then, of course, we moved out of Rafi Marg. The last time I went to the UNI canteen some years ago, I found that it was not being run by the rotund Swamy we were familiar with, but somebody from Himachal Pradesh. And my last visit to the old PTI canteen (James canteen, it was called) would have been sometime in the late eighties.Actually, I did go there a few days ago, but this time it was to a brand new canteen that has just opened up in PTI. Apparently, its not a canteen, but a caf  PTI news caf. It is on the ground floor of the PTI building on Parliament Street. It caters to the news service housed in the same building, but is open to the public, too, from 8 in the morning till 10 at night.I found a lot of office-goers from the neighbourhood when I went there around lunch time. We had thought wed have a special thaali (Rs. 100) with a plate of chicken (Rs. 100), but it was a Tuesday, so I was told by the man at the counter that there was no chicken on the menu. So we had the special thaali and a plate of idli.I must say it was rather nice. The helpings are large, and the thaali consisted of two tandoori lachcha parathas, paneer, kadhi pakori, bhindi, raita, salad and rice. The parathas were excellent  crispy on the outside, and soft within. The pakori was prepared with spinach and besan, and was pretty good. The paneer, in a light tomato-based gravy, was mildly spicy, while the bhindi, a bit too mashy, reminded me of home. The idli was soft, the sambar was fresh and the coconut-dal chutney wasnt bad either.I am told the evening snacks there are excellent  the samosa is crisp and flaky, and the stuffing of potatoes is tasty without being overly spiced. The aloo bonda, again, has a nice crisp casing, and a stuffing of spiced, mashed aloo. The samosa and bonda are for Rs. 12 a piece, and come with coriander chutney.The menu is a comprehensive one, and has dishes such as chholey bhaturey, rajma chawal and chicken biryani on it. But there was no chicken that day, as I said, and chholey bhaturey and rajma chawal werent a part of the days menu, a helpful gentleman at the counter informed me.I saw that the menu listed moong dal halwa. So I rushed to get some, only to be told that there were no desserts that day. But I suppose since it has just started, they will face some teething trouble. And the lunchtime crowd can get a bit chaotic.Like old Arnie, I shall return. But I will make sure that its not on a Tuesday."

As food and drink establishments proliferate in certain locations, like Lower Parel and Bandra Kurla Complex, there are vast swathes of the city where residents live, but without the kind of dining or drinking options that locals crave.As Pooja Kanodia, who is the restaurateur with her husband, Pankaj, says with a laugh, My neighbourhood is very large, it stretches from Cuffe Parade all the way to Lower Parel. Canto, is a new all-day dining restaurant and bar at Opera House, occupying the spot that was formerly Karma. The Kanodias all-day restaurant and bar is targeting those people that dont want to drive to another part of the city for a night out, and is counting on the fact that there are enough people that would rather visit some place closer, that serves both quality food and drinks, and who want to visit often.Canto, lives up on both counts, with a menu that has been put-together by consultant chef Gracian DSouza, and a bar that features signature tipples by Mukesh Khatri of Bar Solutions. The interiors, by Shweta Kaushik, are transportive, allowing you to imagine a swish Milanese clubhouse, with velvet sofas, lots of green tones and arched windows that let you look out to the street. Says Kaushik of the interiors, They wanted a very vintage vibe, and no distressed finishings at all. A mirrored bar area, with black stone helps set off all the colour, and makes a mean spezie negroni, their twist on the classic cocktail, which comes with citrus infused gin, sweet masala vermouth and Campari bitters.A consideration made during the design process was the ample number of power outlets for those that want to work out of the restaurant, while sampling the eaterys all-day menu. Says Pooja, Weve tried to maintain a very warm and inviting feel. The worry, with an eatery that wants to be everythinga caf, bar, restaurant and hang outis that it ends up falling short on all counts. At Canto, that doesnt seem to be a problem, though its still early days when it comes to how customers see the all-day space, after all it opened in May 2.The food, is of the moment though, and Pooja describes it as being, global fusion. What that translates into on the menu is dishes like the ragda bao and sambar risotto. During the course of our interview though, we sampled less fusion fare, including a highly recommended lamb meatballs, which thankfully, had more of the promised tomato and less of the coconut flavour in its sauce. Also on the menu are au current favourites like the cheesy eggs Kejriwal.Even though a majority of the restaurants in the area are all vegetarian, serving up comfort food, at Canto the menu includes non-vegetarian fare, as the Kanodias wanted the eatery to be inclusive and welcoming to all.Canto, Opera House, Charni Road; 30151537; 12 noon to 1.30 a.m."

While farmers were forced to sell tomato at less than Rs 5 per kg, consumers are compelled to buy it at Rs 100 per kg.Price distortions of farm commodities are a continuing phenomenon, as farmers lack control over pricing their own produce. More shocking is the fact that at the receiving end are 30% of rural households who cultivate 82% of arable land in the country.With most landholdings being less than one hectare, the capacity of small holders to bear loss on their produce is anything but suicidal. One farmer suicide every 40 minutes in the country reflects a systemic failure.The crisis amplifies when a previous year high price for a particular crop entices farmers to expand cultivation of the said crop in the following year. Farmers in Andhra Pradesh were shocked when tomatoes fetched Rs 551 per quintal in June this year compared to Rs 3,015 per quintal during the same month last year.Neither was there a drop in consumption of tomatoes nor was there an unexpected glut in the market. And, yet price plummeted like never before. Despite fertilisers and power subsidies, cost of cultivation has been on the increase each year. With farmers not making profit on their small produce (on an average farmers keep 25% produce for home consumption), about 52% of agricultural households are in debt.Average household debt is Rs 47,000. This is unlikely to change as annual income of median farmers is merely Rs 20,000 or just Rs 1,666 per month as per Economic Survey of 2016. That the middlemen and traders are milking large share of the profit is no breaking news. Shocking is the fact that in addition to farmers and consumers bearing the brunt, the state too is at the receiving end of price distortions.Having purchased 8.76 lakh tonnes of onion at a support price of Rs 8 per kg during last five weeks, the Madhya Pradesh State Cooperative Marketing Federation is now forced to sell the same at Rs 2 per kg via the public distribution system.Price distortions have caught the government by surprise too. To avoid onion stocks from rotting over, the Madhya Pradesh State Civil Supplies Corporation could fetch only Rs 2-3 per kg in the open market.One reason for the glut in onion had to do with the Federation purchasing it at a high price which encouraged the farmers from Maharashtra and Gujarat to unload their produce in Madhya Pradesh. However, the cumulative loss to the exchequer in this transaction alone is worth Rs 900 crore.What is true for tomato and onion is equally true for other commodities including pulses. Having stocked two million tonnes of pulses during last two years, crash in market price of pulses has left the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (Nafed) high and dry.All this lends credence to the argument that farmers get no more than 25% of the price that consumers pay, and the minimum support price in the best of circumstances benefits only 6% farmers.Under such conditions, does the governments stated objective of doubling farmers income by 2022 hold any ground? Far from taking the price distortion issue head on, the Niti Aayog instead contends that without additional income from non-farm sources, farmers will not be able to cross income of Rs 18,000 per month even after the doubling efforts.The condition demands a mix of soft and hard options to pull farmers out from the current distress. The soft options include liberalisation of contract farming, direct purchase by processors and bulk buyers, direct sale by farmers to end users etc.The hard options include shifting of the workforce to non-agricultural occupations, an inclusion of supplementary sources of income, modernisation of farming and marketing practices, reforms in land lease and better price realisation.It is clear that none of the options proposed by the Niti Aayog can rid agriculture from prevailing price distortions. If farmers are not assured of remunerative prices for their produce, their interest in farming will wane further.Allow exportsA recent World Bank supported study on Price Distortions in Indian Agriculture by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) suggests a ban on export bans on agriculture commodities to help farmers.The report draws reference to lost opportunity on account of export restrictions on wheat during 2007-2011 subsequent to the lifting of the trade ban wheat exports had touched a high of $5 billion in 2012.The question that begs an answer is whether or not exports directly benefit farmers? Exports do contribute to overall agriculture economics, but do not constitute direct benefit to farmers who are often at the mercy of the unending chain of middlemen.Since farmers income is unlikely to be doubled under the business-as-usual scenario, farmers would need direct cash incentives, in addition to input subsidies, to stay in the business of farming.Improving input efficiency (fertiliser and water) will help farmers make choice of crops to be grown. Crop advisories based on price trends of last few years, transit storage facilities at cluster level, and promotion of cooperative farming can enhance bargaining power of farmers.(Sharma writes on development issues)"

Futuristic looking docking stations, suspended bubble lamps and a wall fronted by space pods with messages flashing on them.It is 2 pm in the afternoon and my younger son, The Foodie and me, have strolled over to New Yorks latest attraction, Eatsa. The eatery has garnered a lot of buzz since it opened for the novel way in which it caters to its patrons. A customer can wander in, browse through the menu, order food, pay and pick up lunch, all without talking to a single human being.Inside Eatsa, a line of gleaming wooden daises with mounted iPads sit like sentinels on duty. We swipe a credit card and the app welcomes Sunita to Eatsa.The menu is divided into Bowls and Bites. But unlike a Starbucks or any of the myriad counter service chains, where there are so many choices and a line of impatient patrons makes you flub your order, here the robot is benign and encourages browsing through the menu.There is a bunch of lunch bowls to select from: Bento Bowl, Burrito Bowl, Smokehouse Salad, No Worry Curry, among others. As always these days in US, displayed prominently above the ingredients for the bowls is information regarding protein, calories, gluten or not, contains dairy or whatnot.I am tempted by many of the bowls: should I get the Toscana bowl? Or should I be adventurous and go for the Cantina Kale salad with jicama, crispy tortilla strips, roasted jalapeno ranch dressing, cilantro, lemon-herb toasted quinoa, green pico de gallo, avocado, green onion, cotija cheese, chipotle black beans, pickled onions, tender kale, and roasted red peppers. Each salad looks tempting and the images inviting.I decide to strike it easy and go for the No Worry Curry: stir fried quinoa with egg, arugula, roasted potatoes, spaghetti squash, pickled onions, red Thai curry, apple-cabbage slaw, curried wonton strips. A preview of the bowl looks delicious and the fact that it has only 660 calories and 17 g of proteins makes me feel thin already.The Foodie decides to challenge the Eatsa android by customizing his own hummus and falafel bowl, removing arugula and tomato cucumber from his bowl of pita chips, tahini dressing, feta cheese, tzatziki, warm lemon-herb toasted quinoa, falafel, kalamata olives, hummus, and harissa. He also orders berry chia parfait from the Bites section and a cold glass of sparkling cucumber melon water.After placing our orders and being thanked politely by the Eatsa cyborg, we scurry over to the next station where the orders are to be fulfilled. This is the best part of Eatsa: a bank of delivery cubbies, with transparent LCD screen as covers.As we wait, with the luminous light of the cubbies throwing a blue sheen on us, I look around. There is a Japanese tourist clicking away with his ubiquitous camera. There is a middle-aged couple looking a bit intimidated at the array of technology. Furtive whispering in a corner and they go out, looking for a restaurant with a human waiter!The order gets fulfilled quickly, not even taking 5 minutes. My name flashes on the screen, with a number next to it, indicating the cubby where my order is to be delivered. The Foodie and I open the screen, take out our order and leave. The entire transaction has taken less than 10 minutes.When we reach home and open our salad bowls, we are pleasantly surprised. The food is fresh, tastefully arranged and just enough for a lunch appetite. The savory flavor of the Thai curry and the red onions, the heartiness of the quinoa, the crunch of the slaw and the wonton strips, all creates a perfect food storm. If anything, the only thing here I would change is the degree of spiciness. For a salad, the chilly content is a bit on the higher side!Eatsas robotic system may sound gimmicky to some dyed-in-the-wool New Yorkers, but we absolutely love it. The second time we walk through its portals, the food android greets me, Welcome back, Sunita. And I almost reach out my hand to pat an old friend on the back!"

Deepak Joshi At the APMC market in Kalyan on Saturday. Deepak JoshiThere has been a split in the ranks of farmers over the decision to withdraw their agitation after a meeting with Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis late on Friday night.A large chunk of farmers criticised the delegation which met the CM and claimed that the strike will continue. The backlash against leaders who were part of the delegation which announced the withdrawal of the strike has been so strong that many of them were forced to make a clarification that the strike has not been called off yet.If farmers think I have made a mistake, then I seek forgiveness from them. If they feel that the strike should continue then I am with them, said Jayaji Suryavanshi, member of the Kisan Kranti Morcha.Suryavanshi seemed to have drawn the maximum ire from farmers who burned his effigies. Visuals of the chief minister speaking into his ears during the marathon four-hour meeting on Friday created a perception that he had struck a deal with the government.This is a decision taken by children of farmers and not by politicians. We have told the state government that if it does not stay true to its promise in the next four months, we will not allow the government to function, Suryavanshi had said soon after the core committee meeting with the CM in which the withdrawal had been announced. However, the backlash the decision received seems to have made many leaders including Suryavanshi rethink their position.Many local farmers were unhappy that the committee decided to take a decision without taking into confidence farmers from across the state.The committee should have heard what the government had to say and then come back and shared the details with farmers. They, however, announced the withdrawal of the strike without any concrete assurances from the state or taking people into confidence. For us they are not a core committee but a chor (thieves) committee and we will continue with the agitation, Bhausaheb Shinde, a farmer from Puntamba in Ahmednagar district, which had become the epicentre of the agitation, said.The Maharashtra Kisan Sabha has also criticised the decision to end the strike.The CM has spun a web around farmers. He has not given any clear assurance. If others want, they can withdraw from the agitation but the Maharashtra Kisan Sabha will continue with its agitation till we receive loan waiver for farmers, said a leader of the Maharashtra Kisan Sabha.Ajit Navale, general secretary of the Kisan Sabha, said, The chief minister did not give a clear answer to any of our demands. The new October 31 deadline that has been declared is a farce the 4-person committee will only announce its findings that day. No concrete decision regarding the waiver of loans or implementation of the Swaminathan report has been taken.Fadnavis has said that the commission shall look into waiving of loans of farmers who have smaller lands. What about Vidarbha or Marathwada, where most farmers have 10 to 15 acres of land, said Navale.The Baliraja Shetkari Sanghatna also criticised the withdrawal and claimed that the government was attempting to create a rift between farmers.I was first invited to a meeting with the CM but was detained by the Pune rural police at Dehu Road police station. I was allowed to go only after the announcement of the strike being called off. This is an attempt to create a rift between farmers, Sanjay Patil Ghanekar, leader of the Baliraja Shetkari Sanghatna, said.Meanwhile, farmers in Nashik held a meeting on Saturday and decided to continue with their agitation including a state-wide bandh on June 5. The farmers meeting also heckled senior BJP leaders including Dindori MP Harishchandra Chavan and BJP MLAs from Nashik Balasaheb Sanap and Devyani Pharande when they tried to attend the meeting, forcing them to leave.In spite of the strike being called off, protests continued in areas like Dindori where women farmers blocked traffic on Kalwan Dindori road. In Saigaon near Yeola in Nashik district, onion and milk were thrown on the road. Similar agitations took place in Jalgaon and Parbhani as well.The decision to call off the strike seems to have had no impact on prices of vegetables which have kept on shooting up in cities like Mumbai. The wholesale price of capsicum jumped from Rs 60 on Friday to Rs 100 on Saturday. Carrot prices increased from Rs 40 to Rs 80, tomato from Rs 30 to Rs 80, brinjal Rs 40 to Rs 80. The price of a bundle of coriander jumped from Rs 100 to Rs 150.Vashi APMC saw nearly 175 vehicles coming into the market. However, the bulk of them were from outside the state.The prices are still high. The decision to take the strike back was taken only late on Friday. The market will remain shut on Sunday. We need to see how farmers react on Monday to the strike call that has been given. Only then will we get a clear picture on when prices can stabilise, Naresh Kor, a trader from Vashi APMC said.Lok Sabha MP Raju Shetti said the people who negotiated with the government were novices and he would hold a meeting of all farmer leaders and groups in Nashik next week to chart out the course of action. The Shiv Sena also criticised the state government and claimed that the state, rather than trying to find a solution, had tried to create a rift between farmers.Rather than trying to sort out the problem, the government seems to have tried to create a rift between farmers. They are just prolonging taking a decision. This is nothing but running away from the problem. It has been the Senas long-standing demand that there should be complete loan waiver for farmers, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The tomatoes cost around Rs 20 to Rs 25 per kilogramme earlier.Tomato sellers assert that because of no supply from Nasik during this season and limited supply from Himachal Pradesh, the rates have skyrocketed. On Saturday, the price went even up to Rs 100. Chandigarh gets its supply of tomatoes from Nasik and Haldwani in normal season which is stopped during the rains.During monsoon, supply of tomatoes comes from Himachal. Now there is a lot of demand for tomatoes and the supply is falling short. Thats why the rates have gone so high, said Desraj, president of Small Vegetable Sellers Association. He added that the rates were expected to hover between Rs 65 and Rs 80 for two more months.Housewives complain that the price of tomatoes are costing more than a packet of paneer. A branded paneer pack of 200 gram costs Rs 60 and tomatoes are costing even more than that. I purchased tomatoes for Rs 100 yesterday from my local vegetable seller. When I asked, he said that he too was paying a hefty price for the tomatoes, said Rashmi, a resident of Sector 21.Many homemakers now prefer to use one tomato in a vegetable. I have told my maid to put only one tomato in any vegetable she cooks. Earlier, she would put at least three. The rates are so high these days that we cant afford to eat tomatoes, said Rajni Lata.Even the hoteliers are using less tomatoes in their vegetables.

The Indian Express had earlier highlighted how farmers sold potatoes at 20 paise per kg at the Pipli grain market in Kurukshetra district. The situation was almost the same elsewhere in the state, too, as there was no mechanism to support the farmers  who were forced to opt for distress sale  even after a bumper potato crop.Khattar claimed that the government has fulfilled almost all the promises made by the BJP ahead of the Assembly polls.

Yesterday, Mr Fadnavis expressed willingness to hold talks with the farmers.""Satyagraha is a birthright of all. The government should not use police force when there is a peaceful agitation,"" Mr Hazare said. He alleged that farmers resorted to protests due to ""anti-farmer"" policies of the government.""Farmers must get an assurance on price of their agricultural produce based on expenses incurred by them on production. This demand has always been neglected by all the past governments,"" Mr Hazare said.A non-political movement of farmers is necessary to put pressure on the whole political system to meet the demands of farmers, he said. ""If farmers' leaders wish so, I am ready to initiate a dialogue with farmers and the government,"" Mr Hazare said.Farmers from many parts of the state including Nashik, Pune and Ahmednagar districts have joined the protest, which entered the second day today. The agitation is mainly spearheaded by activists though parties such as the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna, led by Raju Shetti, an ally of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, have extended moral support to the stir.Among the demands raised by agitating farmers are waiving loans owing to crop failure and indebtedness, besides ensuring a guaranteed minimum support price or MSP for their produce.Farmers in Nashik district are opposing acquisition of land for the proposed Super Communication Expressway connecting Mumbai and Nagpur. A curfew was imposed in Yeola town in Nashik district yesterday, following a clash between the police and stone-pelters.At Lasalgaon in Nashik district, protesters stoned a police jeep, damaging its windshield.

Social activist Anna Hazare also hoped that the stir be conducted in a peaceful manner.Social activist Anna Hazare on Friday extended his support to agitating farmers in Maharashtra and expressed his desire to mediate between the state government and the agriculturists if asked to. He also hoped that the stir be conducted in a peaceful manner. I extend my support to farmers agitation and the cause behind it. It is better if they resort to a peaceful way of protest, Hazare told reporters.The Gandhians appeal for peaceful protest came against the backdrop of farmers agitation turning violent in some parts of the state with the incidents of stone pelting and vandalising of vehicles carrying milk and vegetables to Mumbai being reported on Wednesday night. Appealing to farmers to shun violence, Hazare said he was ready to join discussions between the farmers leaders and Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis if he was asked to.On Friday, Fadnavis expressed willingness to hold talks with the agitating farmers. Satyagraha is a birthright of all. The government should not use police force when there is a peaceful agitation, he said. The septuagenarian alleged that farmers have resorted to protests due to anti-farmer policies of the government. Farmers must get an assurance on price of their agricultural produce based on expenses incurred by them on production. This demand has always been neglected by all the past governments, the anti-graft crusader said.A non-political movement of farmers is necessary to pressurise the whole political system to meet the demands of farmers, he said. If farmers leaders wish so, I am ready to initiate a dialogue with farmers and the government, Hazare said. Farmers from many parts of the state including Nashik, Pune, and Ahmednagar districts have joined the stir, which entered the second day on Friday.The agitation is mainly spearheaded by farmers activists though parties like the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna, led by Raju Shetti, an ally of the ruling BJP, have extended moral support to the stir. Among the demands raised by agitating farmers are waiving loans owing to crop failures and indebtedness, besides ensuring a guaranteed minimum support price (MSP) for their produce. Farmers in Nashik district are opposing acquisition of land for the proposed Super Communication Expressway connecting Mumbai and Nagpur.A curfew was imposed in Yeola town in Nashik district on Thursday, following a clash between the police and a mob of stone pelters. At Lasalgaon in Nashik district, protesters stoned a police jeep, damaging its windshields. Agitators had dumped onions, chillies, mangoes and tomatoes on the road as weekly markets in 82 places in the district remained closed.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Prices for tomatoes at the Dadar market had surged from Rs 15 to Rs 80 per kg for the past couple of days, before cooling down to Rs 50 a kg on Monday. In the suburbs, however, tomatoes continued to sell at upto Rs 100 per kg and coriander at Rs100 a bundle, though daily staples such as onions and potatoes were affordable at Rs18-20 a kg. The supply has greatly reduced and is poor in quality, said Pramod Desai, who owns a vegetable stall in Dadar. He estimates he had to throw out a third of the supply he got Monday, which comes from Nashik.The prices of other commodities rose too. Green peas, usually sold around Rs 80 a kg, were around Rs 120 per kg. The price of cucumbers had almost doubled, selling at Rs 90 instead of Rs 50 per kg. In Byculla, many shops remained shut over the past three days due to unavailability of supplies. We dont have any vegetables, what will we sell? said Aftab Ghaziani, who sells tomatoes.The situation at the Vashi APMC seemed better. The market supply was normalised Monday, according to wholesale traders. However, they expect the prices to be more volatile on Tuesday, as the afternoon supply was disrupted. Today, business was normal, said Nagesh Rao, a wholesale trader.Milk supply hasnt been affected in the city, as most people prefer packaged milk over fresh milk, according to the traders.Buyers have been forced to work with the rising prices. The only solution is to buy fewer vegetables, and hope that the prices stabilise soon. I usually buy 2 kg of tomatoes, but could only afford one the past week, said Prabhadevi resident Huzan Sheikh.At Vile Parle East Market, supply remains short and prices high. We have to charge triple, not even double. Many have been forced into closing shop. Even the limited supply we get is not good quality, as it rots when the lorries are stalled, said Manoj Kandu, a stall owner.Things seem to be looking up at Colaba market, as Badelal Kesarwani, a vendor there said, Prices have fallen since yesterday, and, hopefully, will begin to get back to normal soon. Milk supply has taken a hit as well, with dairies and suppliers complaining of shortage. We only receive 50% of the usual supply since the strike started, said Appa Kurade, who runs a dairy in Vile Parle.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Source: Milind Ghatwai Charred remains of vehicles at Pipliya Mandi, where protesters clashed with traders. Source: Milind GhatwaiFor thousands of unemployed youths who live in villages off the nearly 60-km stretch between Mandsaur and Neemuch in Madhya Pradesh , a solitary soybean plant is the only major hope of employment other than agriculture produce markets or mandis.There are some opportunities in the two towns themselves, famous for licensed opium cultivators and a parallel illegal market, which have brought relative prosperity to this region bordering Rajasthan. In between, however, there are no plants or factories to offer jobs.Job-seekers from these villages have to travel to Ratlam, Pithampur, Neemuch or to Indore, 200 km away. There are a couple of soybean processing plants in Neemuch and a cement factory in Nayagaon, 18 km away, but clearly not enough to absorb them all.After the winter crop is harvested and before sowing for kharif crop begins, youngsters of farming families have nothing on their hands. It was such a crowd that was on the streets from June 1, the first day of what was to be a 10-day strike called in support of fair price for crops.Even the opium growers had protested recently, as also last year, with an entirely different demand. Their protests went largely unnoticed outside because the number of licensed cultivators in Mandsaur, Neemuch and part of Ratlam  the three districts where legal cultivation takes place  is less than 20,000.Forcing vendors not to venture out, throwing onions and tomatoes and spilling milk on the streets, the youngsters roamed in towns and took to highways on their bikes from June 1 to June 4, their aggression increasing by the day.The seeds of the violence that eventually led to the killing of five protesters in firing were sown in Pipliya Mandi town, about 15 km from Mandsaur on the way to Neemuch, on the evening of June 4 when a near 1,000-strong mob forced traders to down shutters.They indulged in hooliganism and loot, insulted shop-owners and their family members. Where will the owner whose shop and house are here go even if he wants to shut the shop down? said a veteran trader, Manohar Lal Jain. Even after curfew was lifted from Pipliya Mandi, the traders were not ready to open their shops until they were provided protection.We only requested them to show solidarity with us by downing shutters, said Sukhlal Patidar of Barkheda Pant village, seated next to Dinesh Patidar, whose 19-year-old son Abhishek was the youngest victim of firing.A complete shutdown and choking of vegetable and milk supplies would have helped us highlight our troubles better because people would have felt the pinch, said Sukhlal. Their refusal to cooperate worsened the situation. When we sell milk we get Rs 22 per litre but if we were to buy it from the market we would have to pay Rs 45. People are ready to buy a water bottle for Rs 20 but refuse to pay that much for what we produce.One trader was so upset by the mob that he chased and beat up a couple of protesters on June 5; the video was widely circulated by farmers among themselves. At least three protesters were beaten and one of them had to be rushed to hospital in critical condition.Do what you want. We wont shut our shops because we have suffered losses. There were just four or five traders but they were adamant, said Sureshchandra Patidar of Chillod Pipliya, at the house of Kanhaiyyalal Patidar, the eldest of the firing victims.The protesters returned and set fire to properties of four traders who had refused to down shutters. Both sides were angry with the local police; the traders felt the police were doing little to control the situation, and the farmers accused them of siding with the traders because of their financial clout.While who exactly fired and under what circumstances is now the subject of a judicial probe, it was amid this volatile situation that two firing incidents took place near Pipliya Mandi on June 6 leaving five protesters dead: a teenager, three under 30, and one aged 44.We had been repeatedly attacked but we kept cool even when some of us were injured, said a police official posted at Pipliya Mandi who cited the tussle between traders and protesters as the genesis of the violence.Describing the plight of the policemen, Home Minister Bhupendra Singh said, They were at the receiving end for days. He had initially claimed that the police had not fired but later said they probably had because Pipliya Mandi police station was under siege.Bumper production, falling prices, demonetisation and alleged involvement of criminal elements all contributed to the anger among farmers; the police firing came amid the standoff between traders and protesters. Since demonetisation, traders who buy produce at mandis gained an advantage that allowed them to manipulate prices and exploit the farmers need for payment in cash, a major factor behind the agitation.The Pipliya Mandi police station, which now resembles a fortress with security personnel milling around, has 65 villages under its jurisdiction. Nearly two dozen vehicles were set on fire by protesters on a 3-km stretch of the highway between Bahi Parshwanath and Pipliya-Mandi, the epicentre that remained out of bounds for authorities for hours on June 6 and 7. Hundreds of youngsters would come out, pelt stones at police or indulge in arson and then melt into nearby fields.Malhargarh Police Station is also on the highway but has only 32 villages under its jurisdiction. It saw far fewer incidents of violence than Pipliya Mandi.There are no job opportunities here. My job as a tempo driver earns me Rs 300 to Rs 400 but I lost even that meagre earning for days. I sat home to save my tempo because if I had ventured out it would have been torched too, said Babloo Pathan of Malhargarh. If you are landless, working on daily wages is the only option, he said, hoping for the situation to improve.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Onion was being sold for just Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh till the state government stepped in to buy, potato is still being sold for 80 paise in Haryana and pigeon pea (tur dal) is fetching no more than Rs 40 in Maharashtra.The glut and plunging prices is the sum total of the crisis staring at farmers across the length and breath of the country. Last week, matters came to a head after farmers protest in Mandsaur of Madhya Pradesh turned violent, resulting in six deaths.Like everywhere else, Mandsaur farmers were agitating after they were forced to sell onions at just Rs1 a kg. The prices are well below what they fetched in 2016: Onion for Rs 1 as against Rs 7, turmeric for Rs 50, half the price in 2016, soya bean at 33% lesser than the rate in 2016 and so on.Farmers blame their plight on demonetisation and the failure of the government to impose adequate import duty on time.Farm economy runs on cash and traders say they have no money to give us. We are forced to sell the produce at whatever price they (traders) are offering, said Jasbir Mamumajra, a sunflower grower from Yamunanagar in Haryana, who blamed demonetisation for his woes.Most of the agriculture trade used to run on cash, mostly unaccounted money, and on credit. With cash being sucked out, the traders have less liquid asset to take risks. In some places they are seeking a commission of up to 2% to make payment in cash.A farm trader in Indias food bowl of Punjab, Devinder Singh, agrees, saying note-bandhi has disturbed the trade cycle. Entire trade shifted to no-credit system. It has hit us hard, he said.An agriculture expert with Bihar government, Anil Kumar Jha, said input costs such as labour, fertilisers and pesticides have gone up significantly this year. This added to the miseries of farmers, already facing cash crisis due to demonetisation.Maharashtra farmers, who were first to protest after prices of pigeon pea (tur dal) fell, blamed the Centre for not imposing high import duty on pulses.The production cost of the tur per quintal is more than Rs5,000 for farmers. With the Union government allowing the import of lentil at Rs 3,700 a quintal, the farmers are not likely to recover their cost, said Vijay Jawandhia, farm activist and Shetkari Sangathana leader.Same was the complaint by farmers in Haryana, who have been forced to sell sunflower at Rs 2,500 per quintal as against the minimum support price of Rs 3,950 even though the cost of seeds have increased by almost 50% in 2016.We could have been saved had the government increased import duty on edible (palm) oil, said Balwinder Singh, a Karnal-based farmer. However, state government officials blamed poor quality for the low price.In Asias largest grain market in Khanna, Punjab, the prices of maize have plummeted with traders like Sanjeev Kumar saying the farmers are bearing the brunt. In Uttar Pradesh, farmers sold wheat at less than the minimum support price, saying government agencies were not willing to buy the produce because of the record production this year.Wholesale traders in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh said the prices of onion, tomato and potato have crashed.The per quintal wholesale prices of the onion in Maharashtra was down to Rs 600-800 from Rs 1,000-1,250 in 2016. Potato in Haryana was sold at Rs 80 a quintal on Tuesday. Farmers sold onion for Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh after which the government announced a procurement price of Rs 8 per kilogram.P Chengal Reddy, founder-chairman of the Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations (CIFA), said: The Centre takes into consideration the average production of past three years and not the current years production cost, in deciding the MSP. If it continues, time is not far when farmers across the country will revolt, he said.(With inputs from state bureaus)"

Why should we have to wait here in this long queue to get aid?We used to have a dream life and weve fallen all the way down to the bottom, said the 38-year-old mother of two, declining to give her full name for fear of reprisals against family members left behind in districts still under jihadist control.IS seized the northern city of Mosul in June 2014 and imposed a brutal form of Islamist rule and a regime of terror on its inhabitants.Life has been made even harder since the battle launched last October by Iraqi security forces to drive out IS. East Mosul and a large part of the west is now back in government hands.In their no-holds-barred defence, the jihadists have used civilians -- caught in the crossfire and already the victims of food, water and electricity shortages -- as human shields.I break the (dawn-to-dusk Ramadan) fast with whatever I can find. Sometimes we even find sand and worms in the water we have to drink, said Umm Mohammed.She was among the women, children and the elderly standing in line amidst the rubble of pulverised buildings and the carcasses of burnt-out cars, many of them protecting their heads from the blistering sun with towels or rags.- What sort of life is this? -Another mother, Umm Yussef, stood nearby in tears, having failed to add her name to the list compiled daily of those entitled to the aid packages of rice, lentils, milk, sugar, tomato juice and cheese.I have 10 children. We break the fast just with water from the well and tomato juice. What sort of life is this? she asked, her voice tinged with both sorrow and anger.Umm Yussef said she would celebrate the Eid feast that follows the Muslim holy month -- at the end of next week -- only once her daughter Leila and their family are freed from Daesh (IS) control.All they have to eat is grass and sand, she said as a passerby handed a biscuit to one of her children.Young volunteers last week handed out 2,000 modest aid packages to inhabitants of areas of west Mosul recaptured by Iraqi forces.We try to meet a modest part of the needs of needy families, said 21-year-old Mohammed Dilan, one of those distributing the aid raised from donations by businessmen and other individuals.For those displaced from Mosul and forced to take refuge in overcrowded camps outside the city, life can be even more treacherous.A mass food poisoning this week at one such camp, Hasansham, left hundreds requiring urgent treatment, officials said Tuesday.Health ministry spokesman Seif al-Badr said around 100 of those affected required serious treatment after the iftar meal which breaks the fast.More than 800,000 people have been forced to flee their homes since the battle for Mosul erupted."

I will make omelettes out of them.Supriyo also took a dig at the politics of BJD and Congress in Odisha, saying the situation in his home state West Bengal was much better.The BJD and Congress have been posing hindrances to central government welfare schemes as a result of which benefits do not reach the poor, he said and added that funds are being siphoned off.At least two of Babul Supriyo's colleagues in the Union Ministry have been subjected to the egg treatment in recent days, mainly by the Congress and Biju Janata Dal (BJD).On Wednesday, Union tribal affairs minister Jual Oram faced eggs and black flags during a visit to Kendrapara. He was less pleased than Babul Supriyo, objecting to the missiles as the protests were anti-adivasi in nature.Oram decided to complain to Union home minister Rajnath Singh since throwing eggs was a breach of security for union ministers and the state government was silent about it.Last Saturday, Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh was greeted with eggs by Congress activists over the death of five farmers in Madhya Pradesh."

The farmers are not even getting the costing of produce. They are in debt and under pressure to give up farming, said Heera Lal Choudhary, vice-president BKS.Farmers are agitated as their produce is not being purchased on MSP and they are not getting water or electricity. During elections, the BJP had promised eight hours of power supply and agricultural connection on a priority basis. After three years, around 4.5 lakh connections are still pending, said Choudhary.BKS is holding an indefinite mahapadav at seven divisional headquarters  Jaipur, Kota, Jodhpur, Udaipur, Bikaner, Bharatpur and Sikar. BKS representatives submitted an 11-point memorandum to the district administration for the chief minister.The government had appealed to farmers to ensure a good harvest, but they cheated us after a bumper production by changing their import-export policy and purchasing pulses from outside, said Choudhary. BKS is a non-political outfit working in the interest of farmers, he said.The mahapadav is a fight for the financial independence of farmers, Heera Lal Choudhary, vice-president BKS has said. (Himanshu Vyas\ HT Photo )He said both the BJP and the Congress have cheated farmers. During elections they make promises and after coming to power they forget their promises. Farmers will prosper when they get the right price. We will go to all levels to get our voices heard. Political parties will get our reply during elections, said Choudhary.Addressing the farmers at the sit-in, state BKS president Mani Lal Lebana said, This mahapadav is to give the government a chance.The government has pay commissions, but what about farmers? We are not getting the right price for our produce. The government is not listening to our demands. They will face the consequences during elections, Sua Lal, a farmer from Pachaar area of Jaipur, said. He added that this year he sold tomatoes at 2 per kg, which should have fetched him 20 a kg. We did not earn even prices of the seeds, he said.Another farmer, Kailash Sharma said, We sold pea at 3 per kg. The seeds cost 200 per kg. What have we earned? If no steps are taken by the government, we will then close villages and block roads.The state government has cancelled the leave of district collectors and police officials in view of the protest and has asked them to keep a close watch on the situation. Security has been tightened in areas around the mahapadav sites. (Himanshu Vyas\ HT Photo )Not only Jaipur, farmers from Ajmer, Jodhpur and Bharatpur too have joined the agitation. Hundreds of farmers held an indefinite dharna at Azad Park, Ajmer.The farmers submitted a memorandum to the divisional commissioner in demanding warehouses at each panchayat headquarters, 247 uninterrupted electricity supply to farmers during sowing season, and adequate representation of farmers in district committee meetings discussing agricultural issues. The farmers are under great economic crisis, said Rajendra Sharma district secretary BKS.In Jodhpur, farmers sat on mahapadav outside the district collectors office. Sangh coordinator Tulchharam Sinvar said the farmers want minimum support price for their produce."

PTI Photo Prannoy will take on Japans Kazumasa Sakai, while compatriot Srikanth will face Korean second seed Son Wan Ho in the semis. PTI PhotoChen Long lost 21-18, 16-21, 21-19 to Indian HS Prannoy in Indonesia, and declared he was operating at a 90 percent of his potential. 9 out of 10 shots of that beastly game that won the Olympic gold in Rio are still formidable, even if Long has only won the Asian Championships since the Games and his last Super Series win came in October of 2015.So Chen Long isnt a prolific champ on the circuit like Lee Chong Wei and neither does he carry the reputation of being unbeatable like Lin Dan at his peak.But what Chen Long most certainly is, is a massive looming presence on court when he stalks the net, a champion whose physical prowess masks his ability to be deceptive, and a good, self-respecting Chinese defensive automaton even at 90 percent who can retrieve till the end of time.Against this force of nature, 24-year-old Prannoy, displayed a wide array of strokes and wits to match in the 75-minute-long encounter. No matter how fragmented the drive and motivation of the two, Prannoy can always claim he beat the Olympic silver and gold medallists on two successive days at the Indonesian Open, playing like a bonafide top contender.There is nothing wrong in losing to a top world player, Chen Long would admit later, even as he admitted he was still testing his skills and collecting points at tournaments this year, and the last 10 percent would be summoned at the Worlds.But first the fairytale of Fantastic Friday for the Indian. Coach Pullela Gopichand talks about his wards aggression as an entity that in Prannoy best stays sheathed.The young man has a bit of a reputation at the academy. He can be excessively scary at times, and his opponents feel it on court, the coach explains. Long might be a beast towering over the court, but Prannoy is known in Indian circles as the big man, not the lightest around, with unconfirmed six-pack abs but an eminently confirmed power-punch in his game.Hes not someone Gopichand had to tutor in aggression. You dont need to show it if you have it inside you  opponents are automatically scared, he says.It was perhaps why he never looked overpowered by the massive Chinaman even in rallies he didnt dominate. Coupled with some sharp movements and a body defense so assured that he exuded confidence when he merely retrieved shuttles without breaking a sweat, Prannoy was ready for a follow-up to his biggest win of his career in terms of rankings  against Chong Wei.He would strike an awkward length that caught Long near his shoulder and smashes that didnt waver out of the lanes. In fact such was Prannoys control on the steep smashes played to the lines coupled with a very respectable netgame that Long was rattled into spraying his own smashes. The Indian would open up a lead at 8-14 in the first and with a lovely tumble-shot at the net pocket the opener to give himself a good look-in into Longs iffy game.His attack mightve been tepid, but his defense is intimidating and at 13-11 in the second set, Longs low stretched retrieve at midcourt just flicked inches off the ground would end a winner, as he would level the sets. Still, Prannoy was constructing his points well, his aggression leashed to follow a plan that Indonesian coach Mulyo Handoyo instructed.In two pristine points, Prannoy would do what Handoyos most illustrious ward Taufik Hidayat did: use the boom smash from back court as a set-up point and rush to the net for the soft kill. Like chip-and-charge in tennis, Taufik had mastered the loading and release of the manouvre, and Prannoy would neatly execute the drill  something thats worked a dozen years against Chinese of the last generation and charmingly Indonesian.Still, it was expected that the Olympic champ would strike back soon enough. At 4-7, Prannoy was staring at a Set 3 taper off; except he wasnt in a mood to let go. He would smash-and-charge to level at 12-all, and thereafter refuse to blink in long rallies using the block at the net and an angled crosscourt as a variation.A bit of luckAt 18-17 came the moment of the match  one of the best in Indo-Chinese shuttle lore. The rally was lengthening and Prannoy would effect a diving retrieve and Chen Long would go for a net kill and almost begin to pump his fist when the Indian stuck his backhand in the way to send it right back over the net. 19-17. A smash, and a slice of luck later, Prannoy induced an error from Long, with nerves not fiddling with his calm plans.Mulyo would look ecstatic, as Prannoy went down on one knee to soak in the moment. Beating a Chinese is a big thing in our country, he would tell BWF later, adding, since yesterdays win, everyone was again excited about badminton.In his 4th meeting with Long, Prannoy had decided to not plan. Frankly speaking I didnt prepare for today, he would stun the local reporters before candidly adding, The way Chen Long won yesterday, 21-7, 21-9, I didnt want to watch, that wouldve played with my head and Id have started thinking its so tough. Ive played him before so I knew what to expect. All I told myself was pick one shuttle more than Chen Long.The lead-up to Indonesia hadnt been a happy one. He was pulled out of the Sudirman squad and asked to work on his fitness by Gopichand.Playing Chen Long is always physically tiring. He doesnt make mistakes, always keeps shuttle in play. But today in last set, I was not getting tired. Physically I felt very sound and confident. That was important, he said.Training with Mulyo has meant longer sessions than what they had earlier thatve been back-breaking for all of Indias top mens singles players. Training is physically tiring, everyday he pushes us. But thats whats getting us the big wins in Super Series, he added.His roommate K Srikanth would also make the semis and will play his big match against Korean World No.1 Son Wan Ho on Saturday after a straight sets win. Indian current players are attacking and they dont mind training hard and have a great will to train a lot, Mulyo would concur, talking to reporters. I want to be with them till they reach international championships at the top regularly, he added.In Prannoys case, Mulyo has found explosive power in the backhand. There is a solidness to his backhand, Gopichand said. Its an unorthodox backhand, raw power with weapons. Weve not worked on it much, its been like this for 8 years  the power and angles on the backhand. The legend is set to grow after two back-to-back wins over shuttles biggest names.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

5a03ab359855b76bf13b8fbf,Green tales from India’s gardens,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2017/jun/19/green-tales-from-indias-gardens-1618572.html,2017-06-20,,The New Indian Express,"After travelling to Pune, Ahmedabad, Delhi, Mumbai, and Hyderabad, Tracing Narratives will be showcased in Chennai.Hosted by the Chennai Architecture Foundation, the exhibition will follow our countrys connect with gardens.CHENNAI: Humans have always had an intrinsic compatibility with nature; the idea of paradise is, after all, a garden lush-green with plants, fruit laden trees and flowery bushes. Be it in our painting patrons, romantic songs in cinemas shot in expansive tulip fields or garden-like sets  India has always had a soft spot for its green. The vast history of gardens and landscape design in India has been compiled into an enthralling exhibition, Tracing Narratives, to be exhibited in Chennai from today, hosted by the Chennai Architecture Foundation as part of Landscape Week.We were beginning to ask ourselves, what the idea of Indian gardens is. We typically ended up discussing the gardens associated with temples, palaces or Mughal and colonial gardens. But for a vast subcontinent like India, these cannot be the only expressions of gardens over time, explains Aniket Bhagwat, a leading landscape architect based in Ahmedabad.As part of Landscape Environment Advancement Foundation (LEAF), which was founded by his father, late Prof Prabhakar B Bhagwat in 2003, they set up a million garden initiative, asking people to send in names of places they felt constitute a garden. This brought up places that we normally dont consider as gardens. For example, a place in the middle of the desert in Kutch, Kala Dungar, where a priest feeds wolves, an ancient crater that had become a lake around which there are many gardens and temples, Aniket recalls.This expanded their idea of what a garden meant. They then began questioning why landscape architecture, instead of being celebrated, is being disregarded. We concluded that its perhaps a fault in our genesis. The genesis of landscape architecture as a profession is the idea of the garden. Theres a huge embedded relationship gardens have in our culture. Because of our over-intellectualising things and assuming that we know our genesis, we have actually forgotten our basis, and fractured it, he rues.LEAF dissected and researched on gardens in India over two years, the result of which is a monograph called Tracing Narratives and a travelling exhibition of the same name. Dedicated to two landscape architects of India  Prabhakar B Bhagwat, Indias first landscape architect, and Mohammad Shaheer, who was involved in restoration of Humayuns garden, Agra  Tracing Narratives eloquently documents the idea of gardens and landscapes in India. Through over a 100 panels, it redefines the whole idea of what a garden is  a not just typical conventional park with trees and shrubs, but also waters structures that dot rivers and tanks, like Abhaneri stepwell in Rajasthan, gardens attached to temples, cemetery gardens, step wells, folklore, etc.The exhibition takes you through literature, paintings, cinema, documents and photographs, with interesting nuggets of information  for instance, did you know that tomatoes were introduced in India from England by the Agri-Horticultural Society of India, in 1857? From works of literature where gardens formed prevalent backdrops, it goes to 19th Century paintings of colonial gardens, the use of landscapes in old and contemporary cinema. Important botanists, horticulturists, writers, foresters and their contributions have also been acknowledged. The voices of various gardens are given a platform  the ancient Mughal gardens in Himalayan backdrops, projects by landscape architects, like the rehabilitation of an old quarry into a forest teeming with over 40 species of birds and trees, intricately illustrated with photographs and illustrations.Weve done this to educate ourselves first. It became an exhibition as a matter of chance, Aniket says, adding that it seems to be bringing the discussion about landscapes to the fore. Exhibitions can have a strange way of affecting the mind. They dont always affect you immediately. A residual idea stays in your mind and keeps niggling at you for a long time, he remarks. The exhibition will be held in Auroville, Kochi and Bengaluru.Expect to be enthralledBooks, movies and paintings which depict landscape and gardensVisual Journey through several gardens across India, from Srinagar to VizagUnderstanding agricultural patterns and highwaysHow invasive species were introduced in IndiaHow nurseries came into existence in IndiaPersonalities who influenced the discipline of landscape designBooks and volumes that document and guide gardening practicesPractitioners of gardening and stunning landscape architecture examplesThe exhibition will be held till June 26,and will be inaugrated today at 5pm, at Lalit Kala Akademi.

Its only twice in a year that the Centre announces support price, based on which the state government also fixes support price.He also informed that a national-level workshop on fixing agriculture prices has been organised at Bengaluru on June 24 and 25. Officials and resource persons from the Central Government are expected to attend the workshop.On the rise in prices of tomato, maize and also arecanut, Kammaradi said its essential to plan according to the produces at district-level with the deputy commissioner tasked with the same.While Dakshina Kannada district is known for black pepper, Haveri district is known for Hebbevu tree cultivation. One can be assured of at least Rs 2.5 lakh income per tree in just six years, he added.Kammaradi said that Chikkamagaluru district, however, has witnessed a dip in ragi cultivation at 16,600 hectares of land, while maize has been cultivated in 21,000 hectares of land. The cultivation of sunflower has dwindled, while 23,000 hectares of land is out of farm activities.The Centre has fixed Rs 5,050 support price per quintal for tur dal while the state government has fixed Rs 450 in addition to it. However, the merchants at APMC yards have been buying the same for a lesser price at Rs 3,500 per qunital. Such issues can be addressed, if group trading is encouraged at markets.To encourage farming further, the state government is all set to cultivate lands at selected eight districts including Kalaburagi, Haveri, Belagavi and other districts. As per the plan, the government will deploy all its schemes and technology of Krishi Vigyan Kendra.The government has already released Rs 25 lakh aid towards the same, he said.Not ignoring the needs of farmers, health cards are being issued to them and also soil card to ensure fertility of the soil, Kammaradi said."

Already hit by plunging prices for the crops he grows in his five-acre family farm in Maharashtras Pimpalgaon Dukre village of Nasik district, he is now staring at abject penury.The state government is set to acquire 50,000 acres of land for the Rs 46,000-crore Mumbai-Nagpur super communication highway to bring development to the backward regions of Vidarbha and Marathwada, but Waghchowre fears it will spell doom for him and his family.The proposed eight-lane highway would eat up four acres of his land holding. We survive and get by because of our land. You take this away from us and we are left with nothing. Not even hope, rues Waghchowre.Watch | Why are Indias farmers seething with anger?Sharing his apprehension are 3,700 farmers in Nasik alone who have registered their objections after receiving the government notification for acquisition of their land. Incidentally, 84% of the land earmarked for the highway project is agricultural.Already caught in the spiral of high input costs and diminishing returns, the highway project is another reason for disquiet among local farmers. The recent farmers protests in north Maharashtra were triggered by the governments land acquisition policies among others.Not just this expressway, but all big-ticket projects cheat farmers, said Ulka Mahajan, an anti-land acquisition activist who had led the protests against the Mahamumbai Special Economic Zone in Raigad. Many farmers agree that road projects such as the Mumbai-Nasik highway will essentially leave them by the wayside.Their list of grievances against the government is long. Top among them is the administrations alleged lack of transparency in land acquisition. Farmers say no social impact assessment was done and the issue of compensation to landless labourers was ignored.They are also not impressed with the price  four times the current market rate  that the government is offering selectively. Our land is irrigated and we can grow crops the whole year round. I dont think you can put a price on that in Maharashtra, said Dhanaji Waghchowre, Shantarams brother.Farming has mostly ceased to be profitable, pushing more and more farmers into a deadly debt trap. According to estimates, 1,129 farmers committed suicide between January and May this year. Majority of these suicides are from Vidarbha and Marathwada, where farmers practice dryland farming. And many of those who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods dont want to give up their lands because theres no viable alternative. The three Waghchowre brothers are among them.As far as Shantaram remembers, the last time he made a killing was in September 2013. Then, he had got Rs 5,000 for a quintal of onions. Belonging to the vegetable belt of Nasik, Shantaram made a cool Rs 2.5 lakh by selling his 50 quintals onions to the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC).Prices have gone downhill since, and so has his financial well-being. 2013 was the best thing to have happenedThis year the price is down to Rs 350 a quintal. I wont even recover my input costs, he said.Farmers spill milk on the road during a demonstration protest over various demands in Nasik. (PTI FILE PHOTO)With onions bringing him tears, he has scaled down his ambitions. A farmer lives on hope. I wont plant onions across my five acres but half an acre is my gamble. Something might pay off, he said. Nearly 40 quintals of unsold onions lie covered under a tarpaulin outside his mud and thatched house adjacent to his field.Onions, however, are just one of Shantarams many problems. Novembers demonetisation hit the family hard and curtailed their access to cash. Then ready-to-harvest tomatoes were lost in a hailstorm in May, resulting in a loss of Rs 40,000. The family thereafter also lost one of its bullocks and the tilling of land in the new sowing season suffered a setback.The Waghchowres are the typical small Maharashtra farmer with three brothers and their families living off the five-acre field. But what separates them from the rest is their irrigated land, courtesy a well and a pipeline that brings water from the Kadwa river nearby. Not every Maharashtria farmer is as lucky, with only 18% of land tilled in the state being irrigated.Report card This is what a Maharashtra farmer got from his farm this year,SS a reason for his anguish Soil quality No soil health card yet from the government Water source: Irrigated by a well and a direct pipeline from the river nearbyNote: This year has been good but in the past, they have faced problems in getting payments on time This is what a Maharashtra farmer got from his farm this year,SS a reason for his anguishIrrigated by a well and a direct pipeline from the river nearbyThis year has been good but in the past, they have faced problems in getting payments on timeShantaram and his two brothers feel that though life isnt exactly good, it could have been much worse without the land. Besides onions, they grow tomatoes, brinjals and sugarcane. Their field is normally lush green even at the height of summer. But that does not necessarily translate into a windfall as there are too many imponderables plaguing the farm sector, including unseasonal rains, pest attacks and price fluctuations.Shrinking profits and heightened unpredictability have put the family in a quandary. The money the brothers make is just enough to feed the family of 10, but inadequate to service their debts. A far bigger challenge at the moment for them is to get Dhanajis daughter Suvarna into a college.The girl has just passed Class 12, the first to do so in the family, but is facing an uncertain future.Where will a farmer get Rs 70,000 by the end of the year for college expenses? asked her mother Sunita. Despite bountiful production, hope is in short supply among farmers of Maharashtra.This is the second part of HTs series, #BeingaFarmerNow. Part 1 focused on the new age farmers of Madhya Pradesh."

The increases for these two grains were also the greatest since 2012/13."

(PTI Photo, File) Nagpur: Farmers throwing vegetables on a road during a protest as part of the Maharashtra bandh over various demands in Nagpur, Maharashtra on Monday. (PTI Photo, File)A HUNDRED years after Mahatma Gandhi led a movement of indigo growers against their oppressor landlords in Bihars Champaran district, farmers of Maharashtra launched an unprecedented strike early this month. But unlike the Champaran Satyagraha, this was a movement led by farmers themselves. It started with farmers from Puntamba, a sleepy village in Ahmednagar district, deciding at a Gram Sabha meeting in April to stop supply of all produce to cities from June 1. That resolution was subsequently adopted by farmers in villages across Maharashtra, culminating in a stunningly successful strike lasting almost 11 days.The striking farmers not only shut down wholesale produce markets and blocked highways to prevent delivery trucks from reaching urban centres, but also even dumped milk and vegetables on the streets. The Maharashtra government was, then, forced to constitute a Cabinet subcommittee of five ministers to hold consultations on the main demands that included a complete waiver of institutional farm loans and remunerative crop prices based on theM S Swaminathan reports formula of 50 per cent returns over cost. These demands were accepted in principle, following which the strike was called off. The collective might of farmers had clearly triumphed over the all-powerful state.The Maharashtra farmers agitation was remarkable for not only its seeming spontaneity and absence of any towering leader, but also it happening in an above-normal rainfall and bumper agricultural harvest year. Such protests one would have normally expected in the event of losses from drought, especially of the kind seen in 2014-15 and 2015-16.But as the accompanying table shows, the Maharashtra government infused around Rs 20,939 crore during the two consecutive drought years through time-honoured relief measures such as crop loss compensation, insurance claims and labour payments under MGNREGA. In addition, rescheduling of crop loans and reduced interest on these  plus the state governments ambitious Jalyukta Shivar programme of water and soil conservation in 25,000 drought-prone villages  turned out to be significant interventions.The trigger for the current farmers agitation has not been any natural calamity-driven distress, which was, on the whole, deftly handled by the state government. Instead, it has primarily been prices.A bumper crop resulting from good rains had ignited hopes among farmers of setting-off their losses from previous years. But what they encountered was a price crash across crops  from cereals and pulses to vegetables and fruits.Take pulses, where the Centre, in a bid to promote their cultivation to bridge domestic shortages, raised the minimum support price for tur (pigeon-pea) from Rs 4,625 to Rs 5,050 per quintal. Farmers obliged by increasing production, but the government failed to honour its promise. Far from getting the promised rate, farmers had to dump tur for as low as Rs 3,000 per quintal. Even during peak summer, they realised hardly Rs 5 per kg for tomatoes, onions and other vegetables.In short, farmers suffered more with record production on the back of good rains than when there was crop failure from drought.A second trigger for the stir was the crop loan waiver announcement by a newly-elected government in Uttar Pradesh, which took place around the same time prices were crashing. Farmer organisations admit that waiving loans cannot be a real solution, but say that it will have a soothing effect in the present context. At the least, it will bring many farmers back into the formal credit system. Also, if there can be a farm loan waiver in UP, then why not in Maharashtra?What is clear from the above is that the risk of price fluctuation in agricultural commodities isnt covered by any of the existing government relief mechanisms. The need of the hour is a framework that insulates farmers from the shocks of not just natural calamities, but also market price crashes. And loan waiver cannot provide any sustainable solution.That said, the Maharashtra farmers agitation  and the state government having to eventually concede to an unconditional loan waiver  is a game-changer, simply for showing how even an otherwise unorganised class can successfully express and negotiate demands. Organised labour unions, not to speak of industry associations like FICCI and CII, are known for constantly engaging in promoting and protecting the interests of their members. Farmers have had no such arrangements for collective lobbying. In this case, though, ordinary farmers under the most lugubrious conditions stood firm on their demands, resisting attempts to divide and weaken their ranks.The following elements may have contributed to the invisible glue of emotional unity among Maharashtras farmers: * Insensitive statements against farmers by some responsible public figures even amidst tumbling crop prices. Similar statements from top bankers (and also the financial regulator) against loan waivers and the possible adverse impact on repayment culture would only have further fuelled resentment among farmers.* The photos/videos of farmers ploughing back their onion and tomato crops because of not being able to afford the additional cost of harvesting. These images went viral on social media and were exchanged by farmers with one another. n Drying up of credit post-demonetisation from cooperatives, the lifeline of farmers in Maharashtra. They were, then, compelled to approach commercial banks and moneylenders for credit on far less favourable terms.* A spike in suicides, including in northern Maharashtra, the countrys top onion and grape producer. The latter belt has been the epicentre of the strike. The losses to its farmers have been more, as they grow a host of cash crops entailing higher investment and also exhibiting greater sensitivity to price crashes. These farmers are generally more well-off, educated and combative. They, not surprisingly, provided the leadership for the movement.* A sustained public debate on farm debt waiver in the last two years, amidst talk of loan write-offs for big corporates. The Oppositions Sangharsh Yatra and also a ruling coalition partners Atmakalesh Yatra marches in support of loan waiver would only have created the perfect pitch for the farmers strike.These elements established a common chord of angst amongst lakhs of farmers, culminating in a state-wide agitation. This is a classic example of collective behaviour driven by group dynamics that leads people to engage in unthinkable acts under unusual circumstances, as was propounded by the American social scientist Robert E Park. And nobody could have imagined that the success of Maharashtras farmer strike would pave the way for similar demands elsewhere, including in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Express Archive) Haryana Agriculture Minister Om Prakash Dhankar. (Source: Express Archive)AFTER FARMERS in Haryana were forced to sell potatoes for as low a price as 20 paise per kg, the BJP government in the state is thinking of creating a system to help peasants whenever they resort to distress sale. State Agriculture Minister Om Prakash Dhankar on Wednesday said the government has planned to offer some sort of support price to such farmers for crops like potatoes, tomatoes, cauliflower and onion, which are currently outside the ambit of MSP (Minimum Support Price).Recently, The Indian Express had highlighted how farmers sold potatoes at 20 paise per kg at the Pipli grain market in Kurukshetra district.We have discussed this issue with the chief minister today to explore how prices of these vegetables can be stabilised. If there are good prices for such crops, then the government may levy more taxes especially on the commission agents so that the government can offer money from this fund to the farmers in case of a drop in prices, said Dhankar, a former national president of the BJP Kisan Morcha.When asked about the waiver of farm loans by neighbouring states, Dhankar said, We are working to make farmers self-sufficient instead of depending on loans by aiming to increase their income to Rs 1 lakh per acre. However, it is a reality that farmers in all corners of the world require assistance in the form of subsidies as the agriculture sector does not result in earnings as high as that of the service sector.The Haryana farmers are on the warpath alleging that their crops were being purchased at throwaway prices this year. Keeping in view the stir, the state government on Wednesday decided to buy 50 per cent of the sunflower crop at MSP.Till now, it had been procuring just 25 per cent of the crop at MSP, which is Rs 3,950 per quintal.In the absence of MSP, the farmers were forced to sell the sunflower crop at the rate of around Rs 2,500 per quintal.For the time being, the farmers have decided not to sell their sunflower crop at throwaway prices. We want that 100 per cent crop of sunflower of the farmers be purchased at the rate of MSP otherwise it has no meaning, said Gurnam Singh Chaduni, president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, Haryana.The farmers have announced to stage a half-naked protest at the grain market of Shahbad Markanda (Kurukshetra) on June 24 when Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar would go to the town to address a rally.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

They are starchy and since, rice is a staple food in South India, people are enjoying Risotto and Paella. The restaurant serves them in combination with seafood and mixed meat as well. For starters, there is a platter with pita bread, hummus, assorted vegetables and tabbouleh made with broken wheat mixed with finely chopped parsley and assorted celery. It is served in a thali, an Indian accent to the festival. The tabbouleh tastes grainy with a tinge of bitterness from the parsley. The toasted pita bread has a crunch.If you prefer something mushy and creamy, go for Risotto. Risotto Alla Promaveera is a vegetable risotto with seasonal veggies including carrots, broccoli and bell peppers, and cheese. This rice dish is creamy and served with garlic bread. Prepared with South Italys most famous rice arborio and cooked with proper rice-water proportion, the chicken risotto is starchy. Topped with fibrous chicken cubes, the rice has longer grains than its vegetarian counterpart.Paella is a mix of ingredients such as saffron, green beans, pepper and tomatoes with seafood or chicken for the non-vegetarians. The warm vegetarian paella tastes more like Indian biryani as it is masaledaar, but it isnt too spicy. It was a bit dry in consistency. The seafood paella looks appealing, bright and colourful. It has the right consistency, like Indian khichdi, topped with shrimps and salmon, and has a flavour of saffron.For desserts, try baklava served with mango paste and mango yoghurt on a graphite stone. The sweet baklava is crunchy. The mango paste tasted of pure mango. With a few small mango pieces on the top, the yogurt is really good.The Paella and Risotto festival is on till June 25.Cost for two: Rs 1,500."

When a TV show is adapted from a book, there is the inevitable clash between the book and the show on whether the series does justice to the book. TV shows give a grand canvas to some great stories and make them come alive for audiences.Be it age-old classics, whodunnits with quirky detectives or new-age fiction novels, some of the best shows from BBC First are now airing in India. Heres a list of 10 best Brit TV series adapted from books.1. WAR AND PEACEOne of Tolstoys finest literary achievements, this novel chronicles the history of the French invasion of Russia and the impact of the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society through the stories of five Russian aristocratic families. Though the novel has been adapted multiple times for both the big and small screen, one of the best adaptions by far is BBCs six-part adaptation of the novel written by Andrew Davies and directed by Tom Harper. This series is being aired on Zee Caf every Monday. The critically acclaimed series was placed at #5 by The Telegraph (UK) in its list of the greatest television adaptations of all time, stating It is safe to say that this is the greatest TV costume drama of the past decade and has raised the bar in a genre for which we are already renowned all over the world.2. PARTNERS IN CRIMEThis six-part drama finally saw Tommy and Tuppence take their rightful place alongside Poirot and Marple as iconic Agatha Christie characters. It showcased Agatha Christies 1922 novel The Secret Adversary and 1941 novel N or M?. This compelling new adaptation, with Christies much-loved characters Tommy and Tuppence, a married couple who solve crimes together, is a favourite among fans old and new.3. PRIDE AND PREJUDICEThis 1995 award-winning adaptation by Andrew Davies from Jane Austens 1813 novel of the same name elevated Colin Firth to stardom! His portrayal of the legendary Mr Darcy caught the imagination of fans across the globe. Pride and Prejudice was critically acclaimed and was honoured with several awards, including a BAFTA Television Award for Jennifer Ehle for Best Actress and an Emmy for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Costume Design for a Miniseries.4. MAIGRETBeing telecast on Zee Caf every Friday, this crime drama is an adaptation of the Maigret books based on a fictional French police detective, actually a commissioner of the Paris Brigade Criminelle. Maigret is a popular character created by writer Georges Simenon around which seventy-six novels and twenty-eight short stories were published between 1931 and 1972. In this BBC First production, Rowan Atkinson, the actor who has so far tickled your funny bone as Mr Bean, will now be seen essaying the role of Jules Maigret. Rowans portrayal of the French detective makes you forget that he was ever Mr. Bean and truly distances himself from his iconic comedic roles. Rather than pulling funny faces, he adopts a forlorn, furrowed demeanour. Rowans portrayal of the pipe-smoking Maigret has been acclaimed by critics as brilliant and a masterclass in understatement. Rowan as Maigret is a gruff, but patient and fair, brooding sleuth puffing contemplatively on his pipe as he attempts to solve the latest grisly murder on the streets of Paris in 1950s.5. ABOVE SUSPICIONThis crime drama is based on the series of Anna Travis novels written by Lynda La Plante and stars Kelly Reilly and Ciarn Hinds as the lead protagonists. The show follows the work of D.C. Anna Travis played by actress Kelly Reilly, a rookie detective determined to prove herself in the male-dominated police department by solving a trail of gruesome murders left by an unknown serial killer. About her role, Reilly had said, Well, shes not a political character like Jane Tennison, shes not fighting her ground and its almost like she just doesnt care. She has an insouciance she wears those skirts and those heels, and while I dont think she uses her femininity or anything like that, she just doesnt hide it. Theres a dilemma for the audience, because normally your prejudices would invite you to dismiss a woman like her who seems a bit awkward and wears tight skirts. But she brings something fresh in among those hackneyed male detectives.6. WOLF HALLThe critics have been unanimous in their praise of the six-part series adaptation of two of Hilary Mantels novels, Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies. The historical drama is a fictionalised biography documenting Thomas Cromwell through his rise in social hierarchy. This series has received the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series while Review aggregator, Rotten Tomatoes gave the show a 100% rating based on 29 reviews with an average rating of 8.6/10. The critical consensus of the show read: Beautifully filmed and brilliantly acted, Wolf Hall masterfully brings Hilary Mantels award-winning novels to life.7. SS-GBThis drama series that airs on Zee Caf every Thursday is an alternate history drama thriller based on the 1978 novel of the same name by Len Deighton. Set in a 1941 alternative timeline when the Germans have won the Battle of Britain, detective Douglas Archer finds himself working under the brutal SS in occupied London. The script written by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade slot together the plots intricate jigsaw as factions within both the resistance and the occupiers enter the deadly endgame.8. CALL THE MIDWIFEOne of the most successful new drama series on BBC One since 2001, this show is an adaptation of the best-selling memoirs of Jennifer Worth about a group of nurse midwives working in the East End of London in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Call the Midwife has been loved by audiences in both the UK and the US and the series has won numerous awards and nominations since its original broadcast. The show has also been praised for raising awareness on a variety of topical, contemporary social, cultural and economic issues, including local community, miscarriage and stillbirths, abortion and unwanted pregnancies, birth defects, poverty, illness, disease epidemics, prostitution, incest, religion, faith, racism, prejudice, alcoholism, disability, (then-illegal) homosexuality, female genital mutilation maternal, paternal and romantic love.9. CRANFORDThis critically acclaimed multiple award-winning comedy drama TV series is based on three novellas - Cranford, My Lady Ludlow, and Mr Harrisons Confessions by Elizabeth Gaskell. It has been adapted brilliantly for TV by Heidi Thomas. Set in the early 1840s in the fictional village of Cranford in North West England, the story focuses primarily on the towns single and widowed middle-class female inhabitants who are comfortable with their traditional way of life and place great store on propriety and maintaining an appearance of gentility. Heidi Thomass script subtly brings out the power of the matriarchs, the centrality of gossip and  when the chips are down  the touching sense of community. It also manages to make the town itself the main character. The result, a much-loved show with memorable characters that capture the audiences imagination.10. SHERLOCKThe critically acclaimed series that has made Benedict Cumberbatch a household name is now a global hit. Based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyles Sherlock Holmes, the show depicts consulting detective, Sherlock Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch) solving various mysteries in modern-day London. Holmes is assisted by his flatmate and friend, Dr John Watson (Martin Freeman), who has returned from military service in Afghanistan. Although Metropolitan Police Service Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade (Rupert Graves) and others are at first suspicious of Holmes, over time his exceptional intellect and bold powers of observation persuade them of his value. Through Watsons blog documenting their adventures, Holmes becomes a reluctant celebrity with the press reporting on his cases and eccentric personal life.Follow @htshowbiz for more"

His model received an award at an FKCCI event recently. Venu says he plans to begin production of the cart in three months and has applied for a patent.Each cart would cost Rs 10,000 to Rs 12,000. An option of renting it would also be available at Rs 500 per week. He claims the cart can keep green leafy vegetables fresh for two to three days and most other vegetables for seven days. Tomatoes can be stored for up to two weeks. The cart is also easier to manoeuvre, with a better steering system in place.The model won the first prize of `1.5 lakh in a competition for business proposals conducted by FKCCI. The model won out of about 100 proposals and after going through five rounds.Speaking of how he came up with the concept, Venu said, I am from a rural background and migrated to Bengaluru when I was in Class 7. I saw many vegetable vendors here who struggled to manoeuvre their carts and were left with surplus goods which would go waste. I wanted to help them in some way.During his MTech course in processing and food engineering at IIHR, he discussed possible solutions for the problems with Dr G Senthil Kumaran, principal scientist at the institute and then came up with the concept. Venu says the cooling system can be used as a cheaper substitute for a refrigerator.Construction of deviceThe device reduces the temperature by 8-10 degree Celsius and increases humidity by 90 per cent. It consists of a metallic frame insulated by a 2-inch layer of charcoal.Two troughs are filled with water and attached at the top and bottom of the frame. A cloth is suspended between the troughs, and due to capillary action it carries water from the top trough to the bottom one. When water in the top trough gets over, itcan be refilled manually or with a motor."

A host of conditions have been stipulated pertaining to food, cleanliness at the kitchen, cooking, transportation, Manoj Rajan, Special Commissioner, BBMP, who is incharge of the Indira canteen project told DH.He said it has been stipulated that the caterer will have to abide by the provisions of the Food Safety and Food Standards Act, 2006. A third party audit will be conducted on a regular basis to monitor quality control and hygiene related issues, Rajan said.Precast technologyIn an innovative move, all Indira canteens are being constructed using 78 prefabricated elements. The government decided to choose precast technology over the conventional brick-and-mortar method as the former has the advantage of quality and speed of construction.It is estimated that precast technology helps in saving up to 64% of the time taken for projects using normal construction method. Each canteen will have eight tall round tables outside the premises and six benches inside. At any time, 80 people can partake food at the canteens, Rajan said. One centralised kitchen per Assembly constituency will cater to all wards in the jurisdiction.LogoThe state government has finalised the logo for Indira canteen after holding a competition in which 600 citizens participated.

It glides off the road, shoots into the sky, and in a handful of melodic action sequences, it lives in the clouds, leaving others (and the Fast & Furious movies) biting the dust.But its not always like that. And thats irritating, as is usually the case with movies that come so close to greatness, but swerve away after a quick graze. Despite ending on a flamboyant note, Baby Driver spends almost two-thirds of its two-hour runtime either idling, or cruising in fourth gear. And during those first two acts, it barely resembles an Edgar Wright movie. It spends too much time in dark rooms lit by fluorescent lights, in grimy diners glowing with neon, and not, as it should have, on the road, with shades drawn over its eyes, and tunes blasting in its ears.Ansel Elgort, right, and Jamie Foxx in a scene from Baby Driver. (AP)The action, when it arrives  first in short bursts, and at the end, in a cascade  is like a burst of nitrous in its pipes.Often, you may have noticed movie trailers describing directors as visionary. I am here to tell you that it is all a lie. Like every other piece of advertising, immoral and sometimes downright criminal, those trailers are perpetuating falsehoods for profit, and stroking the egos of mediocre men.Edgar Wright however, is the real deal. Hes as visionary as they get  right up there with other cult favourites like Quentin Tarantino, Wes Anderson, David Fincher, Bong Joon-ho and Zack Snyder. There isnt a frame in this movies action scenes that doesnt seem as if it has been handcrafted by him. Everything, every moment, from those trademark Edgar Wright inserts and whip pans, precise to the millisecond, to the music video-style editing of the chase sequences, this is a staggering display of one mans vision, and the loyal dedication of hundreds of others to make it a reality.And hes a dying breed. While most major directors are happy, for various reasons  time, efficiency, indecisiveness, studio pressure  to use temporary tracks while editing their films, Wright is the rare contemporary filmmaker who cuts his movie to the music - like Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy), Tarantino, and Guy Ritchie (Snatch). The soundtrack, which includes an unusually high number of songs (30!), is, to paraphrase Tarantino, the soul of his baby.But heres the thing about Baby Driver: Yes, its the darling of the internet right now, having built incredible buzz since its first screening at the South by Southwest Festival. And yes, Edgar Wright has gone to Dwayne Johnson levels to promote it on social media, highlighting, as he should, the films incredible 100% Rotten Tomatoes score. But, its still an Edgar Wright movie  a weird, quirky, tonally hyperactive love-letter to cinema.Which means, its not for everyone.Like his previous films, the cult classic Cornetto Trilogy, and Scott Pilgrim vs The World (all excellent), it faces rather difficult terrain in its journey into the mainstream, but if this is how the rest of the world discovers his work, its not too shabby a place to start.Watch the Baby Driver trailer hereFollow @htshowbiz for moreThe author tweets @RohanNaahar"

The current prices of tomatoes have already soared to Rs 70-80 per kg in retail markets and would remain so for at least next two months.According to wholesalers, the prices have increased due to a heavy reduction in supply of tomatoes from neighbouring states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Haryana after the rain.Tomato prices shooting up is a normal occurrence during the monsoon months, from June to September. This is because the stock spoils easily during the rain. Right now, we are getting our supply only from Himachal Pradesh, said Rajendra Sharma, president of Azadpur Mandi.The shelf life of tomatoes is not more than four days. Not all retailers have an access to cold storage. So, they tend to recover the losses by selling at a higher price, Sharma said.According to wholesalers, the situation will remain the same until fresh stocks arrive in the markets by August-end.On Thursday, the wholesale prices of tomatoes at the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) market at Gazipur were between Rs 30 and 40.The soaring prices of vegetables have affected the sales of vendors in local markets.Till May-June, the retail price of tomatoes was Rs 40 per kg. As soon as the pre-monsoon showers hit the city, the prices climbed to Rs 60 per kg and finally soared to Rs 80 per kg by the end of the month. Due to a spike in prices, people do not buy more than half a kilogram of tomato at a time, said Abdullah, a vendor at Malviya Nagar vegetable market.Even coriander leaves and green chilies, which came complimentary with vegetables, are now being sold with a price tag of over Rs 10-15 for 100 grams. The increase in the vegetable prices has forced many to exclude these from their shopping list.Except for onions and potatoes, prices of all vegetables have increased by Rs 5-10 in the market. I used to buy vegetables for Rs 200 twice a week, but now the same quantity of vegetables cost anything between Rs 300 and Rs 350, said Aarti Malik, a resident of Geetanjali."

After remaining stable till a few weeks ago, tomato prices rapidly increased at Rs 50 per kg in the wholesale markets. Vendors purchase a 25-kg tomato case for Rs 600 and sell native tomatoes at Rs 40 per kg. Tomatoes of higher quality are sold at Rs 50 a kg.However, retailers who buy the same case at Rs 600, sell tomatoes at Rs 65 a kg at Anna Nagar and Kilpauk. The price is high for the past two days. It was at Rs 24 a kg and now it has reached Rs 56. I have cut down on the quantity, says V Nagalakshmi.Supply is less. As tomatoes come from Andhra and Karnataka, the climate there also matters to cultivate crops. Excess rain or heat, both can damage the growth of tomato plants, says Ambedkar V, a vendor.Wholesale markets at Porur and Kilpauk were closed on Friday and those that were open wore a deserted look. With tomato prices on the high, the wholesale price of onion seemed decent. It was sold at Rs 13 a kg in wholesale and Rs 20 a kg in retail.Some retail shops at Anna Nagar sold onion at Rs 80 a kg.Onions and potatoes are being sold at Rs 20 a kg. But Rs 80 is too expensive, says Arjun.V, a wholesaler."

While only eight to 10 items could reach the APMC against the regular 94 kitchen staples. Even the quantum of produce halved on Friday , compared to Thursday and Wednesday .Atotal of 43,827 quintals of fruits and vegetables arrived on Friday as against 70,246 quintals on Thursday and 78,272 quintals on Wednesday , shows data from the state's marketing department.Overnight, retail prices of vegetables and fruits doubled in certain localities, partly because wholesale rates rose and retailers chose to take advantage of the situation. Coriander was a stinging Rs 150-200 for a big bunch, prompting several vendors not to stock it.Andheri resident Shyam More said, ""There was no spike in vegetable prices which normally occurs between March to May . But this two-day strike has turned the situation upside down. The fear is milk supplies could be affected in the days to come, which will worsen our predicament."" The Andheri municipal market wore a forlorn look. Greengrocer Iqbal said, ""I sourced merely a few items like cauliflower, cabbage, spinach and green chillies for the day .

Of these just 50 trucks were from Maharashtra , the rest from Gujarat, AP and MP. But few buyers arrived because of the uncertainty of the situation,"" said APMC trader Shankar Pingle.Pingle said other states were reaping the benefits of a local agitation. Deepak Sathe, owner of Byculla and Vashi's Sai Vegetables said, ""On Sunday, the wholesale rate of tomato was Rs 40-45, cauliflower and ladies' fingers Rs 45, capsicum Rs 50, green chillies and coriander Rs 60.

But see the exorbitant price Mumbaikars are being forced to pay.""Retail prices did fall marginally in certain areas like Dadar, Vikhroli and Bhandup but this was not enough to entice customers back to the market.Retailers opted to stay away from Vashi on Sunday for two reasons. Matunga vendor Rajabhau Patil said, ""We had vegetables left over from the previous day and we knew that few customers would step out to buy Sunday. Also there was the match between India and Pakistan. We cannot replenish our carts in such expensive times unless we are sure we will find buyers.""Several families tend to dine out or cook non-vegetarian fare on Sunday. This is another factor that prompts vendors to keep from adding stocks over the weekend.

Sandeep Gidde (34), an MBA, is a Sangli farmer who also works as an event manager hosting agri-exhibitions. And 47-year old Dhananjay Dhorde has a Bachelor's degree and owns a 15-acre farm in Aurangabad.Younger, educated farmers like them form the backbone of Kisan Kranti, the group spearheading the strike which has crippled vegetable and milk supply chains across large parts of the state. The apolitical, leaderless agitation has drawn support from 37 smaller groups. But its core members are between 30 and 50 years old. Few have participated in previous agitations even though they come from farming families.""Our fathers did `rasta-rokos' and hunger strikes but it led nowhere. So we decided to do something different. If you don't pinch the nose, the mouth won't open,"" says Rayate. Significantly , the Opposition's `Sangharsh Yatra' just two months ago created barely a ripple.Besides small meetings, the use of social media including Whatsaspp and Facebook helped the movement reach out to other groups, guided by Gidde's event management skills. ""I knew how to reach out to large groups of people effectively and what posts could go viral,"" he says.What drew the Kisan Kranti together was the devastating crash in prices of key crops like onions, tomatoes and tur dal over the last year. The issue touched a chord among farmers across districts.The price crash had pushed even prosperous farmers like Rayate deeper into debt. ""Grapes which cost Rs 25 per kilo to grow, fetch a price of Rs 10. Last month brinjals were selling at Rs 25 for 20 kg. It cost more to transport them to the mandi,"" he said.The final catalyst was a gram sabha meeting in Ahmednagar's Puntamba village in April where villagers initially considered boycotting sowing. Later they decided to boycott agricultural markets instead. ""They realized its only when urban food markets are affected that there will be pressure on the government,"" says G Patil, an agro-markets expert who is part of Kisan Kranti.The movement spread to the onion belt of Nashik and the milk producing regions of western Maharashtra including Sangli, Satara and Solapur. Marathwada's districts, mainly Aurangabad, also joined.The discontent among farmers in the north Maharashtra belt had escalated with the state's decontrol of agricultural markets last year, says Patil. ""Traders called a strike for a monthand-a-half and onion prices crashed to 5 paise,"" says Patil. Later, the glut in the onion, tomato and tur crop kept prices low. Farmers ended up dumping their tomato and onion crop. By November, demonetisation added to the crisis.Activists recall a similar agitation led by farmer leader Sharad Joshi in 1982 but this one has created greater impact. ""The idea spread so fast because its time has come,"" says Patil. ""The new generation of farmers are more aware.They understand issues like import subsidies and the fact that crops are sometimes imported at a higher price than domestic rates.""Kisan Kranti has also drawn professionals including lawyers and social workers, whom they rely on for advice.""We have drawn up committees for different tasks: legal advice, meetings with the government, administration and publicity ,"" says Gidde."

I could have easily bought 100 gm of cashew in that money,"" she exclaims.With the farmers of the state protesting the non-waiver of their loans (especially after crop failure), the agitation has led to a massive rise in the prices of vegetables and milk.

Radha Joshi, a chemistry lecturer, says, ""Not only have the prices skyrocketed, the vegetables also don't seem fresh. I understand the plight of the farmers, but this has definitely affected vendors and consumers.

A few weeks ago, onions were selling at Rs 100 per kilo because of drought conditions in Andhra Pradesh. And now, the prices of all vegetables have gone up by at least 40 per cent because of the farmers' strike. There was no constant supply from the wholesale market and vendors had to rely on middlemen. I returned empty-handed from market over the weekend as I felt like I was buying gold, not vegetables.""Ever since the prices have risen, Dhivya Kumar, a second-year commerce student, is in an unusual dilemma. She says, ""I'm on a salad diet, but in the last three days, I haven't been able to afford lettuce or broccoli. The cabbages and carrots that I found in the Bandra market were almost rotten.""

In fact, some portals have shut down the 'vegetable' category in their drop-down menu altogether!

She bought enough vegetables to last a week. ""I was worried that the supply to the markets would stop if the agitation intensifies. So, I bought a lot of vegetables and picked up several cartons of milk, too. However, I don't have enough storage space in my fridge,"" she says.Radha Venkatesh, a homemaker, did the same. But she follows certain steps to prolong the shelf life of the veggies. She says, ""I rely on my grandmother's trick to keep veggies fresher for longer. For instance, I store tomatoes in a bowl lined with newspaper. Ditto with palak and other green leafy vegetables. Wrap the leaves in paper, but consume them before four days. I blanch vegetables like brinjal, capsicum and cucumber in hot water and freeze them. Always remember to store onions in the dark corner of your kitchen. If you keep veggies away from heat source, like stove and fridge, they will last longer.""Bachelors like Vaibhav Chaudhury, intern with a marketing firm, plan to eat all three meals at restaurants. He adds, ""I think I'll save more money that way!""The hospitality sector is one industry that comes directly under fire with the soaring of vegetables prices. Though restaurants haven't cut corners till now, owners aren't sure for how long they'll be able to manage if the prices don't return to normal. Spokesperson of a soup and salad chain says, ""We've neither increased the price nor reduced the portion of our salads till now. But we will take necessary action if the situation doesn't get better."" Ganpat Godambe, manager of a South Indian restaurant in SoBo, adds, ""We still serve onions, tomatoes and cucumbers on every table as that's the norm. We don't want to compromise on the quality and quantity of vegetable curry and dishes, but we hope the prices come back to normal soon.""Mohammed Naeem, a vendor in Colaba market , says things are quite bad on the ground level. He says, ""We've been getting customers, but they are only buying basics. Earlier, veggies like brinjal or bottle gourd (dudhi) were sold at Rs 30 a kilo. But now, they are almost Rs 60-70. Iceberg lettuce is Rs 300 a kilo. Broccolis' regular rates of Rs 160 a kilo has shot up to Rs 300. Kothmir was Rs 20-30 a bundle, but now, it is Rs 100.""Not to forget, a bundle of mint leaves (pudina) now costs a whopping Rs 50. He adds, ""The rate of palak has tripled; it's now selling at Rs 30. Tomatoes are Rs 48 a kilo in wholesale market, but we sell it at Rs 60. That's because there's a wastage of at least 30 per cent when we transport them to our shop. We have no choice but to increase our price accordingly, as we need to earn, too."" Sadly, those who sell vegetables on carts have shut shop altogether. Vilas Shetye says he hasn't set shop at Cuffe Parade in the last two days. ""I couldn't afford to buy from the wholesale market. Others who sell veggies on carts inside complexes only have produce that is more than two days old. But we are hopeful that the situation will improve in the next two days,"" he says optimistically."

In several parts of the state, protesting farmers destroyed stocks of vegetables and milk headed towards cities and clashed with police as the chief minister ruled out a blanket loan waiver.Wholesale prices of certain produce increased by Rs 5-10 on Thursday as only 430 trucks arrived in the Navi Mumbai APMC, compared to the usual 500.""Retail prices did not increase on the first day of the strike. But if the stir continues,and agitationists stop farmers who bring their trucks to Mumbai along the highway, they will have to take a detour via smaller internal roads. Supplies may then shrink as many will not manage to take a long detour,"" said Raja Patil a vendor from Khar municipal market. ""While 30-40% vegetable supplies for Mumbai come from other states, prices of items coming from outside Maharashtra remained constant. Supplies of capsicum and tomato were less than the daily requirement which pushed their prices up. Friday will be decisive,"" said Balasaheb Badade, a trader.On Thursday, hundreds of agitating farmers in western and north Maharashtra and Marathwada region poured milk and dumped vegetables on roads to denounce government's inaction. Meanwhile, the agitation's co-ordinating body said the strike will intensify after chief minister Devendra Fadnavis rejected two of their main demands in a press conference in Mumbai. The CM ruled out a blanket loan waiver and said the state government will have to study whether implementation of the Swaminathan committee report will benefit the state. The Swaminathan committee report suggested support pricing for all agricultural produce in the state. ""A complete loan waiver is not possible for the state. If we had to give a loan waiver to all farmers in the state we would require Rs 1 lakh crore which is not even the revenue of the state per year,"" said Fadnavis. The state's annual revenue is between Rs 85,000-90,000 crore.""There are 31 lakh farmers across the state, who are outside the banking credit system and we are working on a scheme to make them creditworthy again. That itself works out to Rs 30,500 crore. We will have to look into their pending loans for which a committee has been formed,"" said Fadnavis.He slammed farmers who stopped trucks on Thursday and threw the produce on the roads. ""How can these people, who are holding other farmers to ransom, call themselves farmers? A strike has to be voluntary. You can't force anyone to be a part of your group,"" said Fadnavis. The CM said the government has called people leading the protest for talks. He also warned milk co-operatives who are not accepting milk from farmers. ""We will dissolve their board and appoint a government administrator, if these instances continue,"" he said.Finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said in Pune, ""The scenes of farmers resorting to strike are as heartbreaking as mothers shunning their duties towards children. It is definitely not a matter of pride for us that farmers are taking to the streets.""Several instances of stone pelting, burning and damaging of vehicles were reported across the state and police fired in the air to disperse agitators. Curfew was imposed in Yeola, Nashik, where a farmer and a policeman were injured in clashes. Most APMCs in Nashik, Solapur, Ahmednagar and Pune were shut though there was negligible support for the strike in Vidarbha."

Both the groups tried to drown out each other's voice. As Congress workers raised slogans demanding a wavier, BJP workers shouted out the party's achievements. It remained a peaceful affair, however.There was a clash-like situation for a brief moments as the police divided the two groups with a human chain. Congress workers threw tomatoes on the highway to mark their protest, BJP workers soon rushed to calling it Prime Minster Narendra Modi's swachata abhiyan (cleanliness drive). The cops intervened keeping both at a bay from each other.Congress workers have questioned the police's decision to grant permission to BJP workers when a rival party was already supposed to stage protests in the same area. ""This could have led to clashes as it has already happened in Ramtek during similar protests,"" the workers said. The party men also alleged that heavy police arrangement was made to protect the BJP workers.On the road from Nagpur to Fetri, BJP workers had put up posters praising the CM. A little ahead, Congress flags fluttered. The BJP camp was led by party's MLA from Hingna Sameer Meghe and district head Rajiv Poddar. On Congress' side, it was the party's head for Hingna constituency Kundatai Raut, who was later detained by the police. A few workers tonsured their heads as a protest.Fetri sarpanch Jyoti Raut issued a statement listing the steps taken after Fadnavis adopted the village. These include setting up water supply, internal roads, afforestation and electric sub-station.""A lot has happened after the chief minister adopted this village. As far as the farmers are concerned the state government has already declared a waiver package. Not many in this village are affected by the agricultural crisis or defaulted with banks,"" said Raut.Deputy sarpanch Prashant Pawar from Congress countered the claim. ""Farmers could only manage to break even this season and don't have enough to repay their loans,"" said Pawar .""Our agitation is related to the farmers' crisis and the development work taken up by the chief minister is a different issue,"" said Deepak Raut, a Congress leader from nearby Godhni Railway.Urmila Dhavade from Fetri said her family owned a four acre farm and was left with a loan default of Rs50,000. Prabhakar Shastri, also from Fetri, said he had a 13 acre farm and a Rs1.5 lakh loan from Bank of India. Another farmer Sudhakar Shingare claimed to have defaulted on a Rs2 lakh loan.""Congress or BJP, once in power, nobody is bothered about the farmer's plight. I have already sold my land and now live off a pension,"" said an indifferent Ramesh Pawar, a retired teacher."

A few areawise disparities in the prices of some vegetables remained.Tomatoes and onions were being sold at an average price of Rs 15 to 20 per kg in most areas while cauliflower, brinjal and cabbage ranged between Rs 30 to Rs 60 per kg.Vegetable vendor Shankar Surve from Shivaji Market in Camp said retail prices of all vegetables were back to the normal level from June 8 as they were before the farmers' strike.""We also saw normal supply into the wholesale market on Thursday and Friday . Except for leafy vegetables, which always see an increase in price during the first couple of weeks in June, most vegetables like capsicum, brinjal and cabbage were being sold at Rs 30 per kg in Camp,"" he said.Leafy greens are usually up costwise during this time of the year due to inclement rainfall in some parts of the state, which destroys produce or an almost lack of rain resulting in less water supply for the vegetables, sources in the retail industry said.Most leafy vegetables, including fenugreek, spring onions and coriander, were priced at Rs 25 per bunch in the retail markets, currently .Vegetables that arrive in Pune's wholesale market come from the surrounding villages and from other states.For instance, a significant amount of okra comes from Gujarat, potatoes come from Indore. Within Maharashtra, a bulk of produce to the Pune market comes from Jalgaon, Solapur, Satara, Kolhapur, Karad and Bhigwan, among other regions.A vegetable vendor said prices in his area are just 10% above the normal due to less supplies in the wholesale market. ""The supply has reduced as farmers are currently involved in sowing for the kharif season. However, normal supplies may be expected in the next few days,"" he said.In most areas, vegetable prices have come down considerably in comparison to the initial days of the farmers' strike. Ranjeet Pawar, a vendor in Pimple Saudagar, said prices normalized a couple of days ago and most vegetables are below Rs 50 in his area.""Cauliflower was Rs 50 per kg two days back, but has now dipped to Rs 45.

It has also taken up with the Union government to increase procurement of sunflower seeds from 25% to 50% of the state's produce.The information was shared by Haryana agriculture minister Om Prakash Dhankar on Thursday while adding that the state government was implementing Swaminathan commission's recommendations in a step-wise manner by making agriculture risk free for farmers, with zero-interest loans and crop diversification.Replying to a question that Haryana farmers are forced to sell potatoes for even 20 paisa per kg, Dhankar said market forces cause drastic changes in the selling price of farmers' produce. On efforts to stabilise vegetable prices, Dhankar informed, ""There are plans to levy more taxes when prices improve, and use the funds collected for farmers' welfare when the prices drop.""The minister said that the state government has already requested the Centre to procure 50% to states' sunflower seeds produce at the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 3,950 per quintal.To a question on farm debt waiver, Dhankar replied that the state government's main focus is to make farmers self-sufficient instead. He said that a target has been fixed to increase farmers' income to Rs 1 lakh per acre. But he also said that farmers across the world require assistance in the form of subsidies as the agricultural sector does not yield earnings as high as that of the service sector. ""Therefore, the state government offered subsidies to the tune of Rs 11,000 crore per year,"" he said.He informed that during his tour to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji, the delegation studied techniques adopted for horticulture, floriculture, dairying, animal husbandry, storage and transportation of wheat, which would be replicated in Haryana.Taking a dig at the protesting Congress leaders in the state, Dhankar said that the Swaminathan commission's report was submitted to the government in 2006 but the previous Congress government failed to implement its recommendations. ""In fact, the then CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda had formed a committee which further delayed the implementation of the recommendations,"" he said.The minister told that against the commission's recommendation of compensation of Rs 10,000 per acre to farmers, the Congress government paid them only Rs 6,000 per acre whereas the BJP government gave compensation to the tune of Rs 12,000 per acre to farmers."

5a04a53c9855b76bf13be519,As you sow…,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Masquerader/as-you-sow/,2017-06-11,,The Times Of India,"The inventory begins-in agriculture, as in life! Peeling-off the political peels, there lies a core to the matter, which serially has the following aspects.Is farming the riskiest profession in this country, leading to so many suicides? Is a farmers income stability the same or even comparable to that of the wholesaler, retailer or consumer? Why does he have to take a heap of loans, and still continue to top-up? Why does the hand that tills the soil still considered synonymous with poverty? Are MSPs (minimal support prices) calculated on say, 25% above the costs, as retail elsewhere is protected by MRPs? All politicians being farmers (80% truly, the remaining by possession of land), enjoy tax exemptions, and earn their salaries, seem to have the cake and take it too! Can they help filling the loan kitty by paying taxes on their huge farm incomes?Finally, like so many professions, why does the farmer prefer his sons to settle in jobs in cities to plough-in the same profession?Some answers are obvious. Others may be linked to the frailty of human nature. The glaring blunder that one sees is that quite like the Imperial policy. Independent India found it easier to continue to enforce a camouflaged negative input policy (lagaan) on the farmer (In WTO parlance, it was once remarked that Indian agriculture was working on a negative subsidy). After consuming his voting powers, he was to be kept ignorant and disconnected so as not to be able to negotiate his grains in his market-linked product.Misinformation was to make him kneel down before his self -chosen ministers and beg for financial assistance so that he could he could replace himself as the second bull to till the soil once again.He was unaware of one crucial rightthat since he was the owner of the product, he had a right to negotiate for prices with his government, and that would also include international markets. I am not ruling out the democratic process of negotiations. No system was worked out. Our tanned sinewy brothers began to be seen hanging from trees, or slain by pesticides bought from loans, which was actually their own money, perpetually and systematically picked from his pockets. Cant blame anyone in particular, for we have had two farmer Prime Ministers (Ch. Charan Singh, Shri Dewe Gowda). I may vindicate the premise further. Why is loan waiver to the farmer a winning proposition for any political party, and has been tried by every political party!The book of politics is the same. Only editions vary.I had the honour of treating Indias first agronomist, Shri Sharad Joshi, the founder of the Shetkaari Sangathana in Vidarbha.Being a Rajya Sabha member, and for a while a WTO negotiator at that time, he would drop in casually, and often invite me to dinner at the India International Centre.On a particular day, he asked me how much a movie ticket cost twenty years ago. It was reasonable to guess, Rs. 20-25.At the time of the conversation, a PVR ticket was around Rs 500. Regarding onion, and tomato prices, I agreed they must have been around 10-15 then, and 15-25 now.He brought out his point that though the cinema gained 200 times in value (market links not denied), the man who grew the potato, at the most doubled his cost. This yawning gap was not sustainable once the markets get linked (invariably), nationally and internationally. This was the crux he told me.On the other hand, he added, it was not feasible that rice and pulses be sold at Rs. 100-200/kg.and in between lay the unpredictable and meandering river of politics! Sure enough, two months later, Mr Joshi dropped in for a chat, and told me that a politician had relieved him of his WTO duties. Neither he nor I was surprised. I had also begun to realize that even in medicine, mediocrity fetches the bulk.In Darwins quote, survival of the fittest, the word fittest perhaps denotes adaptability of a fox more than it denotes the strength of the lion, or the structure of the dinosaur.A wise government would like to take an opportunity in reforming the system.In its basics, the matter is of production of that which feeds the nation, as well contributes the largest chunk to the national economy, and the prices it should fetch in the market, so that the production is lucrative enough for people to invest and put efforts in this production.The answer lies in all the nitty-gritty that farming is about. Not to deny that government units may be working on it, the seed production units at much less subsidies, can increase yields many folds, for a component that grows naturally.Before one talks of outcomes, investments have to be made in infrastructure. Irrigation schemes, river linking have to pick up priority, much like that for industrial growth.I believe much information is being provided on fertilizers and indigenous soil additives as compost. They need to be capitalized on. I believe with better electricity farmers co-operative mini compost plants would be seen more frequently on the landscape.There is a case of hybrid seeds for certain crops, where there is enough evidence that there are no long- term effects on health. The damage done by pesticides should not be forgotten.Loaning to farmers at lesser rates has a limitation, and as other benefits as MNREGA, should be specific and should have checks that money is transferred, and that it is utilized for an agreed purpose.Finally, what the farmer requires are good fund managers. Money earned during a bumper crop is likely to flow to liquor barrels. It may be sagaciously invested for a rainy day or a non-rainy year.Advance advice on crop suitability worked on basis of demand or congestion of forward delivery chains nationally, and internationally is extremely crucial. Such knowledge is on the back of the palms of the commodity market players, as well as the government. Such information should be part of the fund manager and advisory units that should have every farmer enrolled in his area, and advice be given in one to one encounters. It is heartening to see a few apps by some Bangalore-based companies provide all such information to the farmers.Lastly, comes the question of the government allowing private participation in certain sectors in farming, exports, to make the outcomes comparable, publishable, replicable, and without intending much-reliable!Just heard the Chief Minister broke his fast on the second day. No further changes in the compost policy have been announced!Blog-breaking news! Maharashtra has just announced a loan waiver! Brave! Bharat and India are learning not to cheat on each other!Main chhahta bhi yahi tha, wo bewafa nikley,Usey samajhney ka koi to silsila nikaley(Maybe I wanted her to expose her disloyalty,Perhaps that was the only way to understand the affair)"

While the cost of green chillies have risen to Rs 70 per kg, the price of tomatoes have gone up to Rs 60 per kg. Traders are of the view that prices will increase in the coming days. Vendors at Ernakulam market said before Eid the retail price of green chillies and tomatoes per kg were Rs 60 and Rs 40 respectively. They say sourcing of vegetables from neighbouring states, particularly Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh have become difficult and has resulted in increased prices.""We procure green chillies mainly from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The produce from these regions is sufficient enough to meet local demand.Hence, we have a tough time making procurement,"" said KK Asharaf, vice-chairman, Ernakulam market (vegetable) stall owners association.He also said as production of tomatoes have reduced in North Indian states traders from those regions have started procuring tomatoes from places like Hossur and Bangalore in Karnataka. ""Their trucks have started queuing up at places, where traders from Kochi also buy the produce. The increased demand has resulted in surging prices,"" added Asharaf.Stall owners said the price of carrots and beans have gone up as well. While carrots costs Rs 70 per kg, beans costs Rs 60 per kg. Last week the prices of carrots and beans per kg were Rs 60 and Rs 50, respectively.PV Joy a stall owner at Ernakulam market said that the cost of shallots, onions and coriander have not been affected.""Initially, we thought the price hike was due to Eid festivities.Later we concluded that the real reason was heavy rainfall,"" he said. Shallots costs Rs120 per kg and coriander costs Rs 160 per kg. ""Onions, which cost only Rs 20 has become the most affordable vegetable,"" said Joy .However, locally produced vegetables like bitter gourd, snake gourd, elephant foot yam are available in the market.While bitter gourd and snake gourd costs Rs 40 per kg, elephant foot yam can be bought at a price of Rs 47 per kg. These vegetables are mainly procured from Kottayam, Thrissur and Idukki districts.Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) said price of vegetables surge in the city when arrival from other states decrease. ""Kerala does not produces enough and we are dependent on other states. This is one of the main reason for the hike,"" said an official."

The department conducted a training session-cum-exhibition on Saturday, which was attended by as many as 500 vegetable and fruit farmers from Thondamuthur block. The event familiarised the farmers with drip irrigation systems, use of hybrid seeds, modern farming techniques like shade net and pro-tray, all of which consume less water and produce a good yield.Thondamuthur, one of the main vegetable cultivation belts in the district, has around 70% of cultivable lands covered by drip irrigation. But hardly 50% of them are in working condition, said horticulture department officials. ""We want to achieve 100% coverage in the block, which will be beneficial for the farmers,"" said deputy director A Ramakrishnan. ""On an average, a farmer uses about 25 litres of water a day to irrigate a coconut tree. However, most of that water goes to waste. It is also a massive waste of money. By installing a drip irrigation system, they can save at least 25% of the irrigation water,"" he said.""The State government has allotted Rs 22.02 crore for installation of drip irrigation systems across 3,665 hectares in the district,"" said Ramakrishnan. ""If the fund does get over, we can get funds from other districts,"" he said.The farmers were also told to cultivate a mix of vegetables. ""If you have four to six acres of land, do not cultivate tomato across the land, as you can not manage its water requirement. Instead, you should cultivate tomato, eggplant and lady's fingers, so that even if the price of one vegetable drops, you can earn an income by selling the others,"" said Ramakrishnan.Professors from the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) educated the farmers on the use of shade net, use of polyhouse, biofertilisers, vermicompost and use of hybrid seeds. ""Hybrid seeds are better cultivated in pro-trays because there will not be competition among the seedlings for water and nutrition. They will all grow to the same length within 25 days and can be transferred to the field,"" said PR Kamala Kumaran from TNAU . ""But, hybrid seeds are expensive and can not afford to be wasted,"" he said.Many farmers expressed apprehensions about installing drip irrigation systems and using hybrid seeds. ""I did not install drip irrigation because the farmland in Chadivayal is close to the forests and wild elephants might destroy it,"" said C Kannaiya , a farmer."

I played cricket during college days,"" he adds.His innate love for nature drew him to photography, says Dr Ajit who spent an entire month in Antarctica in 2013. He is thrilled ahead of his trip to Galapagos Islands, located off the west coast of South America.His heart beats for musicDr Thomas A Chandy, director, Hosmat HospitalAn entire floor at his house off Residency Road contains 300 musical instruments collected from across the globe.

I can sing and scream without disturbing others,"" says Dr Chandy, orthopaedic surgeon. A vocalist, he runs an eight-member Jazz band  The Jazz N Rock.""Music gives me great pleasure. I have been singing since my school days.

He runs Pundit Puttaraju Gawai Trust, where visually challenged young girls are taught music through a five-year residential course. Two years ago, he co-founded Belaku  a free residential school for visually challenged children near Magadi Road  along with Ashwini Angadi, honoured with the UN Special Envoy for Global Education's Youth Courage award.""We choose the visually impaired children from the poorest of families. At present, we have 35 children at Belaku. We enrol them when they are five years old and the objective is to send them back to their families when they graduate,"" says Dr Pradeep.She grows her own food, eats healthyDr Mythri Shankar, senior consultant, Nuclear medicine, Cytecare hospitalShe begins her day with a steaming cuppa.

""I do cancer detection tests like PET-CT scans and have to reveal the bad news to patients. Many ask me how they got cancer with no tobacco or cigarette addiction. I tell them that some of the food we consume is affected by chemical fertilizers which are carcinogenic. My passion for growing vegetables stems from the desire to eat safe food,"" says Dr Mythri, who has cut rice from her diet and has been consuming millets for about a year now."

We worked out the plan and are implementing it for the first time in Odisha,"" said chairman of NDDB Dilip Rath.The pilot project is aimed at providing fruits and vegetables to consumers at affordable prices at the same time providing market linkage to vegetable growers and give them a fair price for their produces. ""Initially the board will procure fresh fruits and vegetables from vegetable growers' associations,"" he said.He said Odisha produces 25% less vegetables than the national average and 50% less fruits than the national average. Despite having huge potential in the fruits and vegetables sectors in terms of productivity, Odisha is largely dependent on its neighbouring states. Unlike other states Odisha has plenty of groundwater and favourable weather conditions for vegetable growing, he added.The board also has plans to provide training to farmers and help them with best practices from across the country through agronomic intervention for key horticulture crops like banana, parbal, tomato, brinjal, chilli and lady's finger.Apart from ensuring quality and hygienic fruits and vegetables to consumers, Safal will also promote farm producer organisations, which will streamline procurement. ""We have plans to include 1,000 growers from different districts under the project,"" Rath said.Mother Dairy has also plans to expand the facilities to more filling centres in coming days. ""If we get good response then we would expand in the state and will also replicate the model in other states,"" Rath said."

The Centre has decided to construct 500 cold storage chains across India.Union minister of agriculture Radha Mohan Singh, who was in Gandhinagar to attend the Textile India-2017 exhibition told TOI that these cold storage chains would be useful in helping farmers get better price for the produce and thereby increase their income.Regarding Gujarat farmers demanding a minimum support price for potato, tomato and onions, Singh said that the country already has a list of crops for which minimum support price has been announced. ""But currently there is no plan to upgrade the list or include vegetables in this list,"" Singh said.When told that farmers in Gujarat were throwing their produce away because of low support prices, Singh said that they should use cold storage facilities.Speaking at the seminar on 'Productivity and Product Diversification Challenges for Natural Fibres,' Singh said that natural fibres are the backbone of Indian textile industry. He said that despite stiff competition from synthetic fibres, the demand for natural fibres was steadily increasing with a growing population.The minister further said that given the limitation in increasing area under cultivation, the only way to improve production is increasing productivity. He said that introduction of high-yielding varieties, best agronomical practices, efficient fibre extractors and effective utilization for diversified products will improve productivity. Cotton is produced in over 90 countries across the world, and over 60% of that production comes from India, Singh said.Union textile minister Smriti Irani said the textile ministry and agriculture ministry have decided that the two ministries will have a regular exchange of information, knowledge and feedback on best practices . She said textiles is one of India's leading industries and has the potential to generate employment for millions of people throughout the country. The knowledge sharing will be in local languages so that farmers get the information and are not left out because the information was not a language they did not understand."

These exotic vegetables were collected and are grown by Prabhakar Rao , who is a farmer by passion, but was working as an architect in Dubai until he retired and returned to India in 2011. Once he was back, he opened his farm in Bengaluru and started testing out the seeds to see which of the 560 heirloom seeds he had would be suitable to be grown in the city.""The nature of my work allowed me to travel to almost all parts of the world. Whenever I travelled, I would meet previous generation farmers and ask them if they have any variety of seeds that they used to grow and don't do so anymore. Some of them were gracious and would share a seed or two,"" says Prabhakar.His son, Varun , sees it as a potential agricultural startup business and has plans to expand and get more people to grow these seeds. But Prabhakar collects the seeds out of passion and to ensure that they are not extinct. The father-son duo are currently working on rare varieties of onions and carrots.When we asked if these plants are healthy or genetically modified, Varun, who was an engineer in the US, says that their farming methods are natural farming, which is even better than organic farming. ""We use bio fertilizers  which is made from the cow urine and cow dung of desi cows  as manure. This is sprayed on the soil which, in turn, adds a lot of microbe to the soil, helping the plant absorb the nutrients. With this method, one cow can fertilize up to 12 acres, which makes the cost of natural farming significantly lower than that of organic farming. It is a win-win situation for farmers and consumers,"" says Varun.It is interesting to note that these exotic plants take just a few days longer to grow than the others, and can be grown in your backyard. What's more? You do not have to go back to buy the seeds, since once you grow them, you can cultivate the seeds from the plant itself."

Legend has it that the craft was patronized by Tipu Sultan during times of drought to help the people of Channapatna earn a living. He brought a family of artisans from Persia to make wooden columns and later wooden toys to ornate the columns.Later, when the famous Mysore doll industry started dwindling, all the dolls for Dasara were made in Channapatna, and that's how the tradition lived. The craft flourished and hit its peak in the 70s and 80s when wooden napkin rings were exported in huge numbers.""This was Channapatna's golden period.

While retailers do not link the increase with GST, they feel an apprehension of overall increase in prices in the new tax regime has prompted middlemen to jack up prices. They have also cited less buying by retailers during rainy season as another reason for supply shortage in local markets.In retail markets , increase in average prices is ranging between Rs 10 and Rs 15 per kg. So far, the worst hit has been tomato which has seen a decline in supply and a sharp rise in prices. During the past fortnight, tomato price has increased by around Rs 15 per kg.

Tomato prices have actually shown a sharp rise across the country in the past 10 days following crop damage due to rain in tomato-producing states like Haryana.""We receive the bulk of tomato from Maharashtra. But supplies have gone down substantially in the past few weeks. This has created a supply shortage in the wholesale market. As a result, prices of tomato has almost doubled in the past week,"" said Uttam Mukherjee, chief supervisor of Koley market.Other vegetables, including striped gourd (parwal), ladies finger (bhindi), brinjal and onion, have also recorded increase in prices at city markets.

I happened to see a svelte girl in a dress and stilettos, screwing up her eyes and scrutinising a set of stone-studded bangles, while simultaneously sending the snapshots of the accessories to someone.Presuming her to be a potential customer, the proprietor was busy plying her with choices of pretty accessories. Observing her, I had guessed within seconds that she was just window-shopping as she waited for someone. Just as I had inferred, the moment she saw some guy signalling at her, she hopped out of the shop in long strides without spending a single penny, after squandering the time of the storekeeper!Indeed, window shopping is an art in itself. Perhaps, all it needs is the knack of plunging into minds imponderable depths for those specific things not in the shop, and persistently ask for it till the shopkeeper is full of remorse for not providing you with those items as you leave the shop displaying pseudo displeasure, and importantly, without having pulled your purse-strings! These techniques I had twigged by watching a friend, a terrific window shopper.Recently, this friend was all set to stride into a shop selling full-length skirts. You already have dozens of it. Cant we skirt the idea of buying skirts? I quipped. Her usual refrain was Dekhne meinkyaharzihain yaar? Then rushing inside, she launched on her usual modus operandi of window shopping, as the salesgirl displayed several varieties.Well, this skirt is too garish, flamboyantly coloured Graphic prints too bold in this Geometric patterns, not impressive Dont you think this is over neoteric and outlandish to look? Floral designs, not really captivating The pastel hues, a whitstaid Actually, I am looking for some raven-black and red combo. No, not that cherry-red or blood-red It is tomato-red Needless to say, we walked out later without buying anything!Yet another time, on a scalding noon, coercing me to come along she charged inside a cool jewellery showroom. Sipping into freebie cold beverages, she set off on her strategy. This piece is tad traditional, looks like we have just tumbled out of caves This is too nouveau pattern, spoiling that aesthetic look. Now, dont try diddling us with some inferior stuff. Do I look so credulous? While the salesgirl, sweat trickling down her temples, was tenaciously presenting tantalising designs, my friend was stubbornly shaking her head at every single piece.Later outside, she said cheerily, Imagine all these free mauj, masti, mazaa! Then, she revealed something that stumped me beyond words. Know what I do these days? In snazzy showrooms, I pick up couple of sensuous looking dresses, which surely I wouldnt be buying, then sport them in trial rooms, take selfies and send them across on FB and garner zillions of likes! Indeed, an irredeemable window shopper, I sighed."

Since both my parents were teachers and would often be busy with work, I would cook basic dishes like khichdi and burji for myself. My love for food turned into my passion when I moved to Delhi for my higher studies. I had to cook for myself and that is when I started to explore. I was exposed to a lot of fresh ingredients and spices as I stayed very close to Azadpur Mandi, which was one of the largest vegetable markets.I decided to pursue a career in food and in 2003, I joined the Institute of Hotel Management, Bhubaneswar. It was a completely new experience for me. A new city, new cuisine and dishes like ghugni (snack), dalma (rice), and chhena poda (sweet) were all completely different from what I was used to in Delhi.I was 18 when I entered the industry and I worked with The Oberoi, Kolkata.There again I came across a completely new and different burst of flavours and dishes like rasgullas, sandesh (sweet), jalebis, kala jamun and much more. From Kolkata, I went straight to Kerala, in 2010 for a year, where I fell in love spices like the black pepper, cinnamon, mace, etc. We got fresh fish right out of the water. We were also part of an Ayurveda camp, wherein we had to cook food according to the prescriptions given by doctors for guests who were on medication. I also learnt to make sadhya, (means a feast), karimeen polichathu and Kerala sambar.In 2011, I went to the US and worked at the Steakhouse. There I learnt the fine tuning of steaks with expensive meat products. I also got the opportunity to work for the Carnival Cruise Lines. I travelled to different parts of Mexico, South America and Europe, where I got my hands on the best tomatoes, wines and cheese. I have been with Marriot Chennai since May 2017.I am so glad to have got such wonderful opportunities to travel to different places and explore so much of food, because it has really helped me grow as a chef. I have noticed that Chennai has a mixed set of cuisines, like Udipi, Chettinad, Andhra and so on.I am yet to master South Indian cuisine, but I am quite confident about the North Indian cuisine. Butter chicken, mutton rogan josh, chole, rajma chawal and karimeen pollichathu are some of my best dishes.Meen PollichathuIngredientsCleaned fish steaks/filet: 20 pieces, 1 kg (measured after cleaning)Turmeric powder: 10 gmPepper powder: 20 gmSmall onion: 200 gmCrushed ginger: 50 gmCrushed garlic: 50 gmGreen chilli: 20 gmChilli powder: 50 gmCoriander powder:50 gmTomato: 200 gmCoconut milk powder: 20 gmSalt: 20 gmCurry leaves: 5 gmCoconut oil: 30 mlBanana leaf: 1 bigMethodMake gashes on both sides of the cleaned fish.

5a0525789855b76bf13bfe06,"Food, thy name is...",http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2017/jul/01/food-thy-name-is-1622712.html,2017-07-01,,The New Indian Express,"HYDERABAD: When you are in the Philippines, you get an opportunity to indulge in island hopping, which is as fun-filled as party hopping! You get to explore different places, meet interesting people, and taste different cuisines (if you are willing to do some bold experiments!). Otherwise, if you are like me, come back enlightened about some attention-grabbing food habits.Palawan, a narrow archipelago of 1,780 islands on the western border of the Philippines is bound by the South China Sea on the west and the Sulu Sea on the east, stretching 650 km from tip to tip. Synonymous with spectacular dives, magnificent seascapes and popular activities like snorkelling, kayaking etc., its sanctuaries, hidden lagoons, soaring limestone cliffs and pristine beaches are irresistible to any traveller. The capital city, Puerto Princesa is approximately one-hour air travel from Manila and that was where we landed.Allen, our guide, while briefing us on Palawan Island, said it is mostly inhabited by two tribes: Batak who live up in the mountains and practice slash and burn cultivation and the more civilised Tagbanwa who live in the lowlands. Concluding that their food habits also reflect their ethnic roots, my innocent question on the subject elicited an elaborate discourse from Allen, on the Filipino food culture.Rice is a staple in every meal and one without rice is not considered a full meal. It is only counted as merienda (snack) no matter how large the helping. A day isnt complete without three full, warm meals and snacks in between. It is not unusual to eat five times a day: breakfast, mid-morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack and dinner. Some may even fit in a sixth snack after dinner and before turning in for the night. Asking if the person has eaten or inviting people to eat is a common greeting in the Philippines. It is never polite to refuse food in the Filipino setting - even if you are already very full. A nibble or a bite is enough to show appreciation. Filipinos would rather starve than not prepare a small merienda for a guest - Isnt that typical of Asian hospitality?He went on to elaborate on the unique Filipino food culture and its own idiosyncrasies. Snake meat, he said, is indeed delicious when grilled or roasted and tastes like chicken. Crickets are much-coveted treats when heads, legs, and wings are removed and fried to crispiness on the outside, and soft texture on the inside. The clean farm rats and frogs living in the wilderness too taste like poultry! Tamilok, a mollusc found in the rotting mangroves, tastes like oyster and is a famous delicacy in Palawan.Buwaya, the crocodiles succulent white meat has a distinctive flavour and aroma. It is low in fat, low in calories and high in protein, good for the heart and lungs and is a natural aphrodisiac. What more, its easy to cook, chewy, texture like chicken etc. How about the Abuos, fried ant eggs and larvae? The giant ants/termites eggs and larvae are harvested from trees like the tamarind tree and are relished by all. They are a good source of protein and will lower blood pressure.Besides, some of them thrive on the meat of monitor lizard called bahawa while some relish the flesh of the monkey. As I listened to him, I was reminded of an idiom-One mans meat is another mans poison. Well, their food is their sustenance, their medicine. They look at these animals from a different angle.But the pice de rsistance came that evening at Baywalk Park, one of the most visited tourist attractions in Puerto Princesa City. Apart from its relaxing ambience, the Baywalk Park also houses a number of restaurants, which offers seafood and aphrodisiacs including crocodiles and frogs (Filipino street food is exotic and at times shocking!). There were many carts selling various foods like boiled corn, grilled meat etc. Women were selling boiled duck eggs on a bed of peanuts. Allen announced that he was going to demonstrate how they eat Balut, a popular snack. Balut is a 14 to 18 days old duck embryo, boiled and served with rock salt or spicy vinegar: the contents are eaten directly from the shell, the partially developed embryo bones being soft enough to chew and swallow as a whole.Allen ate it dramatically as we all clicked pictures. Later he explained that it is a powerful aphrodisiac and is very popular with Filipino men. During my brief stay on the bay walk, I saw only women selling it (on push carts) and men consuming. I didnt see any woman eating it. Maybe Filipino women dont need aphrodisiacs!!Then the next day we went for lunch at Badjao Seafront; a floating restaurant built in a mangrove area offering picturesque views of Puerto Princesas seascape and a surreal experience. Walking through the narrow wooden bridge leading to the restaurant, I felt the beauty of every step. The rustic al fresco Badjao rests on stilts and gives a great feeling of being in the midst of mangroves. After hearing Allens stories and seeing him in action, I played it safe and opted for ensaladang talong; a mixture of grilled eggplants, tomatoes and onions tossed in a vinegar dressing. For dessert, I had fresh slices of pineapple and watermelon. Sometimes we eat only to survive. Dont we?(The author is a documentary filmmaker and travel writer; she blogs at vijayaprataptravelandbeyond.com)"

(Representational image) It is time for the establishment to shift its gaze briefly from the stock-market and ask itself what it objects to in Naxalite activity. (Representational image)We are not what we know but what we are willing to learn  Mary Catherine BatesonAge catches up with everyone, and its been no different for ageing hippies and the Beatles generation. For some of us however, the half-century since Naxalbari has been the marker of a lifetime. Retired Naxals are unlikely to reach the centenary; so it was inevitable that we would be asked to write op-ed pieces for the media. As it happened, the Maoists killed 25 CRPF personnel in late April  a bloody anniversary in a violent history. Whatever happened to official conflict resolution? And to the red flag that Charu Mazumdar had prophesied would fly over Red Fort by 1975?Ive heard the phrase peace process from childhood  with reference to the Sino-Indian conflict, Vietnam, the Cold War, Biafra, Egypt-Israel, Palestine, India-Pakistan, Iran-Iraq, Yugoslavia etc. All were  or still are  embroiled in a peace process. Not to mention the never-ending Hindu-Muslim peace process.And then there was Naxalbari. Thereby hangs a story which I have related elsewhere, so will not recount here. But to begin on a tangent  radical wisdom was that everything is political. We used to say everything has a class character. I gradually learned otherwise. Truth does not have a class character; nor do love, laughter, grief and conscience. If they are rendered political they cease being what they are; and we would already be in an Orwellian universe. Air and water and grass are neither Hindu nor Muslim, neither proletarian nor bourgeois. But yes, extremist ideologies are fast becoming the opiate of choice for desperate people. If the centre cannot hold, it is because truth is fragile and of no use to anyone except in distorted bits and pieces. We refuse to stand on our own two feet. What sense may we make of this situation?Bright future etc.The Russian existentialist Nicolai Berdayev (exiled in 1922) said of Communism that what is most terrible in it is the mixture of truth and falsehood. We might rephrase this as the interplay of sociology and utopia. But this is a feature of ideology as such, not just its Communist version. Ideologies combine carefully selected verifiable elements with dreams and promises. Their sociological features pertain to real socio-economic problems and conflicts. The utopian feature assures us of a dream-like solution to those problems; a promise made by a vanguard which will lead us to the glorious new dawn.There is a further dimension, the impulse towards geopolitical reality. Historically this was expressed in projects such as the Crusades, Dar-ul-Islam, Lebensraum, or even the American Century now drawing to a close. The New Medina, Khalistan and Hindu Rashtra fall in the same category, as does ISIS, the latest manifestation of Islamic utopia.A century ago, the Bolshevik regime declared itself an armed camp of the world proletariat. The Peoples Republic of China in its earlier phase saw itself as the red base for world revolution. In each of these cases we see a fragment of world spirit aspiring to unity, a part of humanity declaring itself the whole. These are dreams wherein the dreamer believes himself to be awake in contrast to ordinary mortals who are asleep. And in each the impulse to violent assertion is paramount, because only via murderous passion can such movements gain momentum.Eternal drum-beatMilitarism is the secret of eternal warfare, to which capitalism has accommodated itself. Theres money to be made in conflict, ask any arms dealer, or foreign ministry. This is the ground shared by enemies, upon which every victory is a defeat for humanity. But what if there is inertia to violent conflict, fuelled by psychological, ideological and economic factors? As in the impulse to revenge, doctrinal cussedness, combined with material benefit to some major decision-makers? What if peace process is a chimera?Militarism has a long tradition in India, evidenced most clearly in the activities of revolutionary terrorist groups such as Anusilan and Jugantar. Communal ideologies too, were obsessed with civil war. In November 1947 an AICC resolution warned that the activities of the Muslim National Guards, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the Akali Volunteers and such other organizations represent an endeavour to bring into being private armies, (and) must be regarded as a menace to the hard-won freedom of the country.The proliferation of private armies after 1947 has proven the foresight of this warning. These formations include the Sunlight Sena, Khalistani groups, the Ranvir Sena, the Bajrang Dal, ULFA and jehadi groups in Kashmir and elsewhere. All paramilitaries enjoy some degree of protection by legal parties. In the early 1980s Prime Minister Indira Gandhi saw fit to encourage extremist activists in Punjab (Bhindranwale) as did her successor in Sri Lanka (the LTTE).The carnage that followed her assassination in November 1984 opened the floodgates of state-sponsored hooliganism and the blatant subversion of justice. In Chhattisgarh, the BJP and Congress jointly supported the vigilante Salwa Judum to terrorise those who dared resist the takeover of mineral-rich lands by corporates. Despite a Supreme Court order in 2011 disbanding it, this state-supported vigilante force continues under a different name. Such is the respect for law shown by our political leaders.The paramilitary RSS has forged a far more sophisticated method of overthrowing the Indian Constitution than the Maoists. This method is based on V. D. Savarkars directive of 1942, asking Hindutva cadre to infiltrate the organs of state. But it relies more upon ideological conviction than organizational affiliation. During the Babri Masjid demolition campaign, a retired DGP joined the VHP and called for Indias Muslims to be stripped of voting rights. This campaign cost the lives of some 1500 citizens in 1990 and 3000 in 1992. In the year 2000 a retired CBI Director extolled the Bajrang Dals activities at its annual function.The Modi regime has afforded impunity to vigilantism in the garb of love jihad, Bharat Mata and cow protection. Criminal cases related to terror attacks have been soft-pedalled where they involve RSS cadre. Interference with criminal justice has been attested to by the prosecutor Rohini Salian; and includes the Malegaon and Samjhauta train cases. The Hindutva lobby has used official clout to unleash captive mobs, hate-speech, push RSS cadre into state institutions and suborn security forces. The latter practice was noted by the Union Home Ministry in its February 1948 order banning the RSS after Mahatma Gandhis assassination.Elephant in the drawing roomIt is time for the establishment to shift its gaze briefly from the stock-market and ask itself what it objects to in Naxalite activity. Is it lawlessness and contempt for the Constitution? But does Naxalism hold a monopoly on lawlessness? Every mainstream party carries a burden in this regard. Not just the Congress and BJP/RSS, powerful state parties too are culpable. The CPI (M) dispatched a vigilante force to Nandigram on two occasions in 2007. Killer gangs of the CPI (M) and the RSS operate in Kerala. Isnt there a problem when people in authority misuse formal power to promote violence? The appearance on April 10, 2016 of Gujarat ex-DIG Vanzara, accused of engineering a fake encounter, on a podium with RSS leader Mohan Bhagwat signals something sinister  the relentless effort by the RSS to abolish the distinction between legal and illegal violence.Those who want Maoist violence to stop must tell us what happens to their conscience in the face of the RSSs contempt for the rule of law. The Sangh defends itself by flaunting its patriotism. But Naxalites are nationalists too  they see themselves as political inheritors of Bhagat Singh. When the Home Minister denounces the Sukma incident as cold-blooded murder, he needs to be reminded that that his political allies have been murdering people on some pretext or other on a regular basis.Was not the murder of Pehlu Khan cold-blooded? Did not the NHRC indict the Chhatisgarh police in January for sexual violence against Adivasis? Did not RSS affiliates attack a police station in UP on April 23 and beat up policemen, even entering the residence of an IPS officer on one occasion? Does anyone believe that the law will take its own course in these matters? We are on the verge of becoming an entirely lawless state, and who, pray, is responsible for this?Undoubtedly there are police officers, magistrates and judges committed to constitutional norms. But it is clear that the Modi government and the RSS are interested in securing an ideological bias within the criminal justice system. Why are murder trials involving Hindutva activists collapsing? Why was Judge Jyotsna Yagnik (who convicted Maya Kodnani and Babu Bajrangi) threatened and her protection withdrawn? Why was Rohini Salian asked to go slow on the Malegaon prosecutions? Why is the ruling party sponsoring an assault on judicial independence? Do we want the government of India to fall under the dictatorship of an ideology?The Sangh Parivar and its supporters should understand this simple truth: the ideological corruption of justice will destroy Indias reputation as a law-governed democracy. Whatever the stock-brokers, contractors and corporate managers might think of this, the erosion of this reputation will drive Indias laboring classes and ordinary citizens toward desperation; and generate future insurgencies.Violence is an outcome of humiliation, not of poverty. Those dreaming of Hindu Rashtra should study the ongoing disaster in the Nizam-i-Mustafa next door. Akhand Bharat and Hindu Rashtra are mutually exclusive ideals  if you get one, forget the other. If you love India, call off your hooligans and practice the non-violence that you preach to Naxalites.NaxalismNaxalite insurgency in India is propelled by three factors  the brutal injustice experienced by the rural poor; the vested interest of a powerful section of the establishment; and the utopian ideology of Maoist intelligentsia, compounded by the criminalization and logistical inertia of their military machine. The three work in tandem. Each is well documented  we need only recapitulate the 1986 Arwal massacre, the activities of the Ranvir Sena and Salwa Judum; the thousands of tribals in prison, the numerous allegations of unpunished molestation.The scale of the humiliation undergone by the working population has to be acknowledged in order to understand insurgency. The Naxalite project will never succeed, but neither will insurgency disappear. Indian justice is a manufactory for insurgents. A major factor is that many powerful persons want it to continue. Thus, as recently as December 2014, a retiring DG of the CRPF stated that the continuation of Naxalite violence was beneficial for some state governments covetous of central funds. This has been corroborated by observers within the state apparatus.However, people want the chance to get on with their lives  they want justice, but not at the cost of perpetual conflict. The comrades may well dream of going down in a heroic flame, but have no right to impose that dream upon others. Insurgent violence leads only to trauma and the desire for revenge. Dreams of liberation get smothered in cruelty; warfare mutates into a self-propelling automaton. The numbers of ordinary persons killed by Maoists is legion, but we may simply recall the names of tribal policemen Francis Induwar and Lucas Tete, tribal rights activist comrade Kenduka Arjun, NREGA activist Niyamat Ansari and journalist Nemichand Jain, all murdered between 2009 and 2013. Those interested can pursue the details of these unfortunates.And the deliberate derailment of the Jnaneswari Express in May 2010 that resulted in over 140 deaths was a crime that no ideology could possibly justify. Was it collateral damage? When Communist actions become amenable to the Pentagons terminology, we can see militarism for what it is  a doctrine for sociopaths and a pathway to criminalisation.Regardless of the ethics of the Maoist leadership, normal persons can understand why it is the height of irresponsibility to perform actions whose repercussions you know in advance: lifelong sorrow for families of the dead; repression upon the civilian population; a handle for the government to attack journalists and lawyers; onslaughts on democratic organisations struggling for popular causes; and steady erosion of constitutional governance. Some commanders like Sabyasachi Panda (arrested in 2014), had realized the futile nature of Naxalite warfare. The point now is whether the cadre can use their experiences to distinguish between a struggle for social democracy and a suicidal waste of lives.Lost opportunitiesDecades of peoples war and the history of Indian Communism have much to teach us. What is the record as regards human rights, resistance to communal politics and the preservation of democracy? Is it not clear that a section of the Indian ruling class wants to destroy democracy? Are the comrades sure that there is no difference between constitutional democracy and a state under siege by the RSS? India does not need a violent revolution to overthrow the Constitution, but a mass satyagraha to defend it. And that requires a much greater mental and physical effort than organizing a vigilante force.Communists could have made such an effort in other contexts. Consider what might have happened in 1971 if the Communists had made amends for the disastrous Adhikari resolution of 1942 (that supported the Muslim League), by initiating a reassessment of the anti-democratic Partition of 1947. The CPI (ML) could have launched a debate free of the hateful views of communalists, both Muslim and Hindu. But the leadership was incapable of upsetting Chairman Mao. Dreamers of a classless society found it too utopian to question the partition of India. Thus Naxalites became the only Indian party to support Yahya Khan, a bloody tyrant hated by his own people. Ultra-left communists turned out to be moral and mental zombies.In 1990, if left-wing groups had set aside their differences in order to defend the Babri Masjid, they could have prevented the terrible atrocities unleashed by communalists. Till this day Indian Communism has produced no thorough-going analysis of communalism, the most grievous political issue for over a century. And, barring honourable examples (especially from Punjab during the period of Khalistani terrorism), the Naxalite movement has been reluctant to confront communalists.Can Naxalites start afresh?Democracy is a necessity for the workers movement  it is the ruling class for whom democratic institutions are a nuisance. The proper functioning of these institutions requires that people be able to exercise their basic rights without fear. Relief from violence would be a major gain for oppressed sections of society. Forcing Indian rulers to implement the Constitution is a major task that will require mass movements on an unprecedented scale; and statesmanship of a high order. Those who claim to work for the exploited classes must know that society desperately needs relief from violence. If Maoists had the courage to cast aside their futile dogma they could regain a decisive position in national politics.The inheritors of Naxalism should lay down their arms and challenge the ruling class to adhere to the Constitution, reform the criminal justice system, root out corruption; punish the instigators of communal and caste massacres; disband militias including the armed wings of the RSS; repeal the SEZ Act; pass the Womens Reservation Bill and develop the forest and tribal areas for the benefit of the people rather than corporate interests. Such a challenge, accompanied by an unconditional promise to stop the violence, will electrify the political situation. It will place them in a responsible political position; and save the lives of thousands of ordinary people. Too much blood has been shed. Violence is predictable, comrades. Fifty years after Naxalbari, do something unpredictable. It will bring smiles to millions of faces.Speak the truth.Stop the killing.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

The dominant arm of the elite was, of course, the Congress, which was in power from 1947 until 2014 except only for 13 years (1977-1980, 1989-91 and 1996-2004).The present news trend, and expert opinions, are very confusing. You have a marked improvement in agricultural growth, and you have farmer riots in two large states  Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. You have an economy that has been slowing since June 2016, and inflation now at historical lows, and you have economic experts stating that the RBI/MPC decisions have been valid because the wise MPC is looking beyond the temporary decline in inflation to 2 per cent brought about by demonetisation.One of the major objectives of demonetisation was to diminish the role of cash (read black money) transactions. However, if the expert headlines are to be believed, the volume of digital transactions is contracting. What we are witnessing in India is a historic transformation  one that occurs rarely in most countries. It has never occurred in India before, never. But it is happening now. It is a changing of the guard  more appropriately, a changing of the elites.The single most critical factor in Indian politics, from its independence in 1947 until the birth of the Modi administration in 2014, was that the same elite ruled the country. Regardless of political affiliation, this elite had broadly the same political and economic philosophy, characterised by Western-style social liberalism and Fabian economic socialism. In addition, traditionally, the elite was heavily anti-American.The dominant arm of the elite was,The dominant arm of the elite was, of course, the Congress, which was in power from 1947 until 2014 except only for 13 years (1977-1980, 1989-91 and 1996-2004). And except for five years (1991-1996), a Gandhi family leader was the PM or in charge (as was the case during the 2004-2014 period when Manmohan Singh was the PM, but Sonia Gandhi was in control).The influential English-language press shares the basic Congress worldview. Thus, they could not possibly believe that Modi, an unabashed Hindu leader, would win in 2014. There was a parallel belief that the BJP could not possibly win in the largest state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) in 2017. Of course, the rise of a new cosmology represented by Modi wasnt an overnight phenomenon, as things were gradually changing. Starting with Narasimha Rao, India began to distance itself from heavy state involvement in economic activities. Economic reforms (especially for industry) were introduced in 1991, tax reforms in 1997, and the beginning of disinvestment in 1998. With the signing of the nuclear deal with US President George Bush in 2008, the first major step towards the American camp was taken by India.As time went on, however, it became increasingly clear that the old elite had failed to notice and respect that India had changed from the illiterate and feudal order prevalent at the time the Nehru dynasty assumed control. There are complex factors feeding into each other to explain the publics increasing mistrust in the old elite, but it can safely be pointed out that the educational level of average Indians has risen; the old elite mismanaged the economy  and power corrupted the old elite.The Indian people are asking more questions and demanding greater accountability from dynastic political leaders. But the old elite  politicians, corporates, left-intellectuals, academics  cannot be expected to give up their privileges so easily. They will try to derail the transformation and object at every turn: If that means fake analysis, they will do so. If that means intellectual gymnastics, they will do so. The key point is that they must do so.This is a long drawn-out battle, and a healthy battle. This is what checks and balances are all about. Should the new elite emerge without being questioned? No. Can the new elite just be allowed to roll over the old elite? Definitely not. Will the old elite use all its instruments, and cash in all the old I-owe-you(s) in order to influence the debate, even with fake news and even flakier analysis, if need be? You bet. This is one movie India has never seen before. Sit back, learn, comprehend and enjoy.The battle is joined from all sides. Even from within the BJP. The new elite wants to rewrite history. That is its privilege. But do they have to distort history as much as they claim the Congress did? And do they have to ban documentaries, just like Indira Gandhi did with the banning of Louis Malles nine-hour documentary Phantom India? Or, the later banning of The Satanic Verses?It is important that history be re-written  all new-born elites have done that since time immemorial. But why write history in as distorted a manner as the previous 70 years  by obliterating any mention of Nehru? And will you next sink as low as previous historians who find that the actions of General Rawat (defending parading an innocent as a human shield) and General Dyer (who oversaw the Jallianwala Bagh massacre) are comparable? Invoke Savarkar if you will, but also mention that he was not opposed to cow slaughter. And remember your Hindu Vedic ancestors, who not only did not infringe on the diets of others, but also ate beef.In my previous article (Just why are farmers rioting, IE, June 10), I documented that because of good weather, agricultural growth in 2016-17 was much better than the previous two years (4.9 per cent in 2016-17 vs an average of 0.5 per cent in 2014-15 and 2015-16). Farmer incomes had improved  so, riots now and not before? Some experts pointed out that flower sellers had suffered because of demonetisation  true; some others pointed out that vegetable sellers had suffered, especially those cultivating potatoes, onions and tomatoes. And many, indirectly or directly, attributed all of the price decline to the disruptive policy of demonetisation.The same experts are silent on what happened to fruit prices, also a perishable crop and subject to bad demonetisation  fruit prices (wholesale and consumer) are up 5 per cent y-o-y. And they are silent on sugar, rice and wheat farmers  their prices are up 10-15 per cent. How many vegetable farmers in India? Less than 4 million. How many rice, sugar and wheat farmers  close to 90 million.Now, demonetisation. This is aNow, demonetisation. This is a parallel to the farmers-are-justified-in-rioting-with-record-crop-output flake news. And that is that demonetisation was a comprehensive failure because its simplest goal  reduce cash transactions  has not been achieved. The evidence offered by several experts  RBI data on cash and non-cash transactions since November 2016.There is a basic flaw in this lazy approach to ideological analysis. The experts only process data from November onwards, and are not willing (because of the results?) to look at the change in non-cash transactions over the last three years. They compare April to March 2017, find the volume of transactions lower, and conclude that demonetisation was a failure. The old elite could not possibly do a worse job!The accompanying table documents RBI data on all non-cash transactions (by volume) since 2014. For each year, the data reported is an average for the months January-April. Card usage is only for POS transactions (as emphasised by the RBI in its weekly releases). You be the judge. Total non-cash transactions increased by 53 per cent over last year, January-April. And non-cash transactions induced by demonetisation  debit and credit cards (POS), prepaid and mobile  are up 173 per cent. Your sixth-grade daughter will tell you this is doubling every eight months. And you maintain that demonetisation has failed to move India rapidly towards less cash (less black money) transactions?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

If such unrest could happen in MP, which claims to have registered the fastest agri-GDP growth at 9.7 per cent per year during 2005-06 to 2014-15, then no state is likely to be immune from it.MP has been a showcase for the performance of BJP-ruled states in agriculture. But it now appears that agriculture could be Prime Minister Narendra Modis Achilles heel. The governments poor performance in the sector at the all-India level  testified to by a growth rate of less than 2 per cent per annum during 2014/15 to 2016/17  has to be addressed quickly, and in a sustained manner. Otherwise, the neglect of agriculture may cost the PM heavily in 2019.What has really gone wrong with agriculture during the Modi era? And how can it be fixed? We focus here on prices and farm loans, although agriculture suffers from a number of problems.The current protest in MP seems to have been triggered by the crash in onion prices, but it also drew strength from the news of loan waivers in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Maharashtra. The seeds of competitive loan waivers were sown by the PM himself  at a rally during the election to the UP assembly, he announced that farmer loans will be waived in the very first meeting of the new UP cabinet, if the BJP were to be voted to power in the state. The new UP Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath, followed the PMs advice diligently.Farmers in other states have been watching, and the loan waiver could lead to a demand for similar waivers in other states  Haryana, Punjab, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. We wont be surprised if loan waivers cost state treasuries Rs 2,00,000 crore in the months to come, taking state-level deficits closer to 4 per cent of their GDP.What is it that the farmers are demanding? Simply remunerative prices for their farm produce. The BJP had promised in its 2014 election manifesto that if voted to office, the party will ensure 50 per cent margin to farmers over their costs. Where does the Modi government stand on that promise after three years in office, compared to the last three years of the Manmohan Singh government?Graphics by Sarfaraz Graphics by SarfarazWe dug out official data of net margins (the MSP minus cost C2) from the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices reports of the last six years (see Graph 1). The bitter truth is that net margins in most agricultural commodities  paddy, maize, cotton, gram, sugarcane  have actually declined during the Modi regime. Moreover, if one looks at just 2016-17 data, there were negative margins on several commodities: Jowar (-18 per cent), ragi (-20 per cent), sesamum (-14 per cent), sunflower (-13 per cent), groundnut (-4 per cent), moong (-7 per cent) and urad (-4 per cent). With a glut in tur production, market prices fell way below the MSP and the real losses were even higher. Potatoes, onions and tomatoes seem to have met the same fate.No wonder there is widespread unrest amongst farmers. They suffered back-to-back droughts in the first two years of the Modi government, and now, in the third year, despite good rains and bumper harvests, they are suffering due to the collapse in prices. Loan waivers are not a solution: They are band-aids and give temporary breathing space to policymakers.The best way to handle prices is to get the markets right. Remember, prices are determined by the forces of demand and supply, and cost enters through the supply curve. Factoring in only the costs plus pricing without considering the demand side can lead to even greater distortions, and therefore needs to be avoided.But how does one get markets right? Take the case of tur; India had a bumper harvest of tur in the last season. But the government banned its exports, private entities were not allowed to hold stocks and trading in futures had also been banned. No wonder, with bumper harvest on the one hand, and strangulated markets on the other, prices crashed, tumbling way below the MSP, creating misery for farmers and causing unrest.The solution is simple: Abolish all export bans, private stocking limits and restrictions on futures trading in all agri-commodities. This is all the more desirable in commodities whose imports are open at low or zero duties. If this is not done, the government will be forced to buy all commodities whose prices nosedive. This is neither an efficient, nor a feasible policy option.For perishables like onions, potatoes and tomatoes, we need more and better storage facilities, linkages with processing firms, contract farming, opening land lease markets, etc. We need to develop efficient, equitable value chains  like the AMUL model in dairy.But there is one problem on the agri-credit front that needs to be addressed urgently. Farmers need cash immediately after harvests to pay their debts from formal and informal sources. Warehouse receipt systems and giving the farmers advances against their stocks is the way to go.The biggest failure of the RBI and NABARD has been on the financial inclusion front: Even in 2013  the latest information we have  of the total outstanding debt of rural households, 44 per cent came from informal sources (Graph 2). Interest rates in the informal sector hover anywhere from 15-30 per cent.Thus, instead of interest subvention schemes, the government needs to focus on financial inclusion if it wants to address farmers problems on a sustainable basis.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5a0531b79855b76bf13c00ff,The crops of wrath,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-crops-of-wrath-demonetisation-4699598/,2017-06-12,,Indian Express,"Demonetisation may not have hit agriculture production but it is the cause for the current unrest Demonetisation may not have hit agriculture production but it is the cause for the current unrestWhen demonetisation happened, many, including this writer, thought the decision, taken at the start of rabi plantings in November, would significantly impact farm production. We were proved wrong. Good monsoon rains, after successive drought years, besides the timely onset of winter conducive to germination, turned out to be strong motivations for farmers to sow, even if this entailed begging or borrowing. They successfully weathered the DeMo storm by simply replacing cash with deferred payments, for labour, purchase of seed, fertiliser and pesticides. Informal credit networks and social capital ensured that, at the end of the day, we had a bumper crop.Where demonetisation did have an impact, however, was in the prices received during harvest: Potatoes in Farrukhabad, Uttar Pradesh, fetched below Rs 350 per quintal this February, compared to Rs 600 or more last year. Moreover, while prices in 2016 had crossed Rs 1,100/quintal by mid-May, they are stuck even now at Rs 350-400. The same goes for rabi onions in Lasalgaon, Maharashtra, that traded at an average of Rs 450 per quintal in May, as against Rs 750-800 and Rs 1,200 in the same month of the preceding two years. Farmers, likewise, sold tomatoes at Kolar, Karnataka, in early May for Rs 300-400 per quintal, down from Rs 1,500-1,600 a year ago.When was the last time we saw all three  potatoes, onions and tomatoes  wholesaling at less than Rs 5/kg, and even retail prices within Rs 20/kg? And this, in peak summer! The above fire sales  the evocative term used by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its latest bimonthly monetary policy review statement  has been repeated across a range of other crops too: Garlic and methi (fenugreek) seed prices at Mandsaur  the district in Madhya Pradeshs Malwa region thats become synonymous with the ongoing farmer unrest  averaged Rs 3,400 and Rs 3,100-3,200 per quintal in April, whereas these ruled at over Rs 4,100 and Rs 4,700-4,800 respectively during the same time last year. Farmers in Nashik, which has also witnessed large-scale street action, along with the rest of Western Maharashtra, had to dump Sonaka grapes at about Rs 12 per kg in March, having sold the same green seedless variety for Rs 45 or so last year.Even more illustrative is the story of soyabean, a kharif crop that, at harvest time in November, quoted at Rs 2,800-2,900 in Indore  that price has barely moved since then, even as sowing for the new season has commenced. A similar fate has befallen arhar/tur (pigeon-pea), which realised Rs 4,300-4,500 in January-February at Gulbarga, Karnataka.That rate, already below the governments minimum support price of Rs 5,050, has fallen further to Rs 3,700-3,800 levels now. Given a choice, will any farmer plant soyabean or arhar in this kharif season?The idea behind throwing these numbers is to emphasise a fact that should be obvious: Whats going on isnt an ordinary fire sale limited to one or two commodities. This is not an isolated sugar or egg price crash, affecting only the cane grower in Muzaffarnagar and Sangli, or the layer poultry farmer of Namakkal. It is about a generalised fall in prices across agricultural commodities. Weve entered deflation territory in farm produce, whose proximate trigger clearly has been demonetisation.How? Well, much of the produce trading in India is cash-based and financed through a chain of mandi intermediaries, processors, input dealers and retailers. While difficult to establish, anecdotal reports suggest that this traditional agro-commercial capital was dealt a body blow by demonetisation. The collateral damage from it has been a haemorrhaging of liquidity from the markets. With the trade, which used to previously buy and stock up whenever prices fell, no longer active  it neither has the cash, nor the confidence now  the produce markets are suddenly without an important source of liquidity. True, this speculative capital was also a source of inflation, wherein, say, a 10 per cent production shortfall led to prices zooming 200 per cent. But today, its the opposite: A 10 per cent output increase engenders a 200 per cent price collapse.One does not know how long it would take for formal finance, banks, commodity trading houses or organised retail, to fill the void left by traditional agro-commercial capital whose transactions were largely in cash. Till that happens and liquidity truly returns, the ultimate sufferer is the farmer, evidence of which is visible in mandi prices and restive hinterlands.But even assuming demonetisations effects to be transitory, there is another elephant in the room in the form of inflation targeting. The finance ministry and the RBI, in February, 2015, signed a monetary policy framework agreement, obliging the latter to achieve an annual consumer price index (CPI) inflation target of 4 per cent, subject to a plus/minus 2 per cent band. While such inflation targeting may have been adopted by some 29 other countries, the Indian case is unique because of the sheer weight of food and non-alcoholic beverages in its CPI. At 45.86 per cent, this is way above the corresponding combined share of these items in the official CPIs of the United Kingdom (10.3 per cent), Canada (16.41 per cent) or New Zealand (18.84 per cent).Given the high weightage of agricultural products in its CPI, the success of inflation targeting in India is predicated on what happens to food prices. And since inflation at the retail and not just the wholesale level is whats being targeted, it inherently incentivises policy actions that depress farm prices (fire sales may, after all, not be all that bad a thing for the five wise men and one woman constituting the RBIs monetary policy committee). That could also explain why our policymakers today are naturally predisposed towards imposing controls on stockholding, domestic movement and export of farm goods, alongside allowing duty-free imports, at the slightest hint of a price increase  while doing nothing when produce realisations hit rock bottom.Inflation eventually isnt just a matter of the prices of goods and services going up or down. It is also about whose prices are rising and whose are falling  in other words, winners and losers. In the current deflationary environment, the farmers are the clear losers.harish.damodaran@expressindia.comFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Apart from the natural calamity of drought, there were man-made calamities, and this column is about how the two have brought about the explosive situation in the country.Farmers agitations are spreading across many states. It is the culmination of the acute distress in the farm sector that many observers have written and spoken about in the last two years. Two years of drought in many states was the main cause. The governments cannot be blamed for the occurrence of drought, but governments are solely responsible for the mismanagement of the consequences of drought. Apart from the natural calamity of drought, there were man-made calamities, and this column is about how the two have brought about the explosive situation in the country.The bulk of farmers in India have no choice but to do farming. Land is the only asset they have, farming is the only skill they possess, and unless they grow food many of them will face starvation. Agriculture, despite its declining share in total output (GDP), is also the largest employer. In Indias economy, the agriculture sector has primacy.The Price of NeglectUnfortunately, the NDA government lost sight of this basic truth. The agriculture portfolio is the Cinderella of this government. The Minister of Agriculture, unchanged since May 2014, is a political lightweight with little clout within the government. (How many of you can name Mr Sharad Pawars successor?). The minister has been neither seen nor heard by most people. The only memorable statement on agriculture that I can recall was when he repeated the Prime Ministers promise to double farmers income in 6 years and when asked if they had meant real income or nominal income, there was deafening silence.On the other hand, the government erred grievously on the issue of minimum support prices (MSP). In its manifesto and in the election campaign, the BJP had unequivocally promised that it would implement the M S Swaminathan Committees recommendation that MSP should be cost plus 50 per cent. In government, the BJP not only reneged on its promise, it dealt a body blow to farmers by denying them even a reasonable increase in MSP in its first three years. The numbers speak for themselves:The ostensible reason for denying a fair MSP was that higher MSP fueled inflation, which is partly true, but to lean in favour of inflation control against the interest of Indias farmer-producers was the height of folly. Some inflation is inevitable, and the government and the RBI must use other instruments to moderate inflation rather than reduce the farming community to penury.Errors galoreThe second grave error was demonetisation. Mr Harish Damodaran has convincingly demonstrated how demonetisation has crippled the post-harvest agricultural economy (see The Crops of Wrath, Indian Express, June 12, 2017). Agricultural products are bought and sold largely in cash. Demonetisation dried up liquidity and prices have crashed. According to Mr Damodaran, never before have prices of tomato, potato and onion crashed at the same time. Same is the situation with soyabean, arhar, garlic, methi (fenugreek) and grapes. Saying that farmers have resorted to fire sales, Mr Damodarans conclusion is, We have entered deflation territory in farm produce, whose proximate trigger clearly has been demonetisation.The third error was when the Prime Minister announced, on behalf of the yet-to-be-elected Uttar Pradesh government, that all farm loans in UP will be waived if the BJP formed the government. More likely, it was just an election promise in a state that the BJP perhaps did not expect to win, but it was an unequivocal promise that has returned to haunt the BJP in several states. Farm loan waivers are neither intrinsically good nor bad. As Dr M S Swaminathan said a few days ago, Loan waivers, though temporarily necessary, do not provide for a secure long term credit system (emphasis supplied). When farmers do not get a fair and reasonable price and are unable to repay their loans, they demand a loan waiver. The holder of the highest political office promised a total loan waiver, why blame the farmers for demanding that the promise be implemented?In February 2008, the fiscal situation was excellent, growth had found a new momentum, and a one-time loan forgiveness to small and medium farmers was justified. The central government was confident it could fund the waiver and so it went ahead and announced it. In 2017, however, every prudent norm was turned on its head. The Prime Minister promised a loan waiver on behalf of an yet-to-be-elected state government, no one seems to have examined the capacity of UP to bear the burden, and no one seems to have factored the fallout in other states. Having mounted a tiger, the BJP does not know how to dismount it. Meanwhile, the tiger is galloping through Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Gujarat.Jobless youth angryThe last straw was jobless growth. Young men can find no work on farms or off farms. Micro, small and medium businesses are not offering new jobs. Tier 2, 3 and 4 towns are full of jobless youth and their anger has turned against the central government. The BJP will not admit its mistakes. Nor will any BJP leader tell the Prime Minister that mistakes were made. Will the Prime Minister pull a rabbit out of the hat? Wait and see.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Shopkeepers and vendors claimed that there are now few takers for the vegetable. Shopkeepers in the city blamed supply shortage and the weather affecting perishable items for the price rise.Until last week, the retail price of tomatoes was Rs35 per kg. As soon as pre-monsoon showers hit the city, the prices went up to Rs60 per kg and finally reached Rs80 per kg by Sunday. Due to a spike in prices, people are not buying more than half kg at a time now, said Chain Singh, a vendor at Nirvana Country vegetable market.On Saturday, tomatoes cost Rs70 per kg and on Sunday Rs85 per kg, the shopkeeper said prices will go up to Rs100 per kg, said Anveshika Singh of Nirvana Country, Sector 50. Other upscale localities such as DLF, South City and Malibu Towne also reported high prices.Vegetable vendors estimate that tomatoes will continue to cost more for at least two months. Prices of other vegetables are also going up by Rs10 to Rs20 a kg, they said.On an average, Gurgaon gets 500 to 600 quintals of tomatoes daily, but on Sunday, the citys wholesale market received 200 quintals of tomatoes, immediately increasing retail prices by Rs10 a kg in a day.According to wholesalers of Khandsa market, prices have increased due to a major reduction in supply from Shimla in Himachal Pradesh, Ladwa in Haryana, and places in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and western India. They added that the situation will remain the same till fresh stocks arrive by the last week of August. The cultivation period in Rajasthan, Mewat, Farrukhnagar and other nearby areas has ended, they said.Read I A month ago, tomatoes were being thrown away in GurgaonThe shortfall and the transport costs are major causes of the price rise, said Pankaj Kumar, a shopkeeper in Sector 30 market.Tomato prices always increase during monsoon. The stock perishes easily during this season and we cannot store it for more than four days, said Ram Kumar, a wholesaler.Haryana agriculture minister, OP Dhankar, said while the high prices are an inconvenience to consumers, One should also realise that farmers had a very difficult season this year.People must also keep in mind that the high prices will help the farmers in some ways, he added."

Thangabali, named after theChennai Expressbaddie, is a catchy name for an eatery that dishes up traditional blockbusters from Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. At the restaurant, we crane our necks to follow the old-world map depicting Akhanda Bharat (greater India), and the 12th century spice route of India. The idea is to recreate the authentic local flavours and make it a foodies haven. Jambotkar adds, urging us to go through an extensive menu presented on a coconut scraper.To begin with we munch on crunchy murukku, dipping the coarse sticks into three chutneys  garlic, tomato, and kairi. We quite like the kairi chutney that makes our mouths water and eyes shrivel, but little do we know that the raw garlic chutney is just our first tryst with a meal that feels as it was meant to keep vampires at bay.For the vegetarian options, we choose the non-traditional: paneer ajadina (Rs. 180), which has cubes of crispy cottage cheese in a sukka masala of grated coconut, kundapura masala of chillies, cumin, coriander seeds and fenugreek. A tad bit too salty, the sukka is high on finely-chopped garlic that we wish had been used more discreetly. The non-veg starter, clams chilli coriander (Rs. 200) is a big relief, and we love the taste of sea, salt and coriander chilli paste minced in a palatable fishy mash. We take a big sip of the sol kadi, but it sets off an unwanted green chilli fire in our mouths. Sadly our crisp bombil fry (Rs. 150) doesnt have enough of a crusty coating and the batter falls apart from the flaky fish.For mains, we opt for the mutton stew with fluffy appams (Rs. 290). Unfortunately, the meat is chewy and the curry watery, separating from the khada masala. Our server has forgotten our order of Kundapur Chicken (Rs. 270) but brings us the side of neer dosa that sadly goes cold by the time our Mangalorean curry arrives. But, we relish the curry with a soft and flaky Malabari parotta, which maybe the best we have had till date.For sweets: the paal payasam (Rs. 90) feels like an overdose of coconut shavings, and we wish the milk had been allowed to thicken into a pudding. We love the gulab badam kulfi (Rs. 150) but it came to us in a semi-melted state, instead of neat, frozen pieces.Despite the hits and misses Thangabali holds the promise of a traditional eatery. What they need to do is fine tune the dishes and while they are at it, fix the uncomfortable seating too.The author was at a preview tasting on the restaurants invite.Thangabali, Mahim; noon to 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. to midnight; 24474499"

The decision was taken at a meeting of the Morcha in Nashik on Sunday, which also said the agitation will continue till their demands for loan waivers and minimum support price are met by the government. The bandh will exclude Mumbai.In a meeting with Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday, a section of farmer leaders unilaterally announced that the strike had been called off. However, farmers in Nashik, Ahmednagar, Solapur and Western Maharashtra continued with agitation, which intensified on Sunday.At the core commitee meeting at Nashik on Sunday, farmers leaders reiterated that the strike will not be called off based on promises made by Mr Fadnavis. We want the promises to be implemented. The CM has been making these promises repeatedly for months now, Ajit Nawale, state secretary, Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha (ABKS), said.Besides an immediate waiving off of all farm loans, the Morcha has demanded that all cases against protesting farmers be withdrawn unconditionally. The committee will meet again on June 7 in Mumbai, and has organised a State-wide conference in Nashik a day later. The conference is expected to be attended by farmers leaders, where a final decision on the mode of protest will be taken. Mr. Nawale will be holding a self-introspection rally in Puntamba in Ahmednagar district, the village where the strike originated, over the alleged betrayal by the section of farmer leaders that called off the strike.Though the government had planned on keeping Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMC) on Sunday, most of them remained closed and reported a drop of nearly 60% in vehicles arriving with produce. There were protests in Nashik, Ahmednagar, Kolhapur, Aurangabad and parts of Vidarbha. theFarmer leader Jayaji Suryavanshi, accused of brokering a deal with Mr. Fadnavis and calling the strike off, faced the wrath of protesters who pelted tomatoes on his residence in Aurangabad.Meanwhile, State Revenue Minister Chandrakant Patil accused NCP chief and former Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar of doing little for farmers when his party was in power. Why is Sharad Pawar showing so much concern for farmers? His party failed to give them a minimum support price (MSP) during its 15-year rule. Mr. Pawars recent allegations come from fear of losing his Janata Raja identity.Last week, Mr. Pawar had claimed the government was trying to divide farmers by leaking reports that it is considering loan waivers for a section of farmers.

His family owns a piece of land  about 27 bighas  in Barkheda Path, a village 22 km north of Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh where they grow soybean, methi (fenugreek) and chana (gram). On June 6, Abhishek went to Mandsaur along with hundreds of others from his village to protest against the falling crop prices that were pushing his family to the brink of desperation. Tragically, he became one of the victims of police firing, taking three bullets on a day when farmer protests across the western belt stretching from Madhya Pradesh to Maharashtra reached a frenzied pitch. He was too young but was keen to join the protest.

With an approximate population of 3,500, 95% of the population is engaged in farming in landholdings that are less than a hectare per family. Abhisheks family members narrate their tale of loss. The last three years have crushed our backbone because prices have plunged, forcing us to sell our produce at rates where we dont even recover our investment, says Dinesh, adding, todays market price for soybean is Rs. 2,500-2,700 per quintal while our cost to produce one quintal is above Rs. 3,000. Not only soybean, prices of onion, gram, methi , vegetables, milk have bottomed while input costs have soared for seeds, fertilizers, labour and transport, he says.Madhya Pradesh consistently boasts of double-digit growth in agriculture  averaging 13.9% during 2010-15  and like many other States, had a bumper harvest following a good monsoon in 2016. Yet as per the National Crime Records Bureau statistics, as many as 1,982 farmers committed suicide in the State in 2016-17. A combination of factors  falling procurement prices because of a glut of produce in the market, a cash crunch due to last years demonetisation policy and the predominance of smaller landholdings which are expensive to maintain  have led to a simmering anger. Like their counterparts in many parts of Maharashtra, farmers in Mandsaur launched an agitation demanding remunerative prices for their onion, soybean and pulses. As thousands of farmers poured onto the streets, stopping traffic, attacking trucks and confronting police, things turned violent and five farmers were killed as a result of police firing and a curfew was imposed across five districts.Farmers from the Mandsaur-Neemuch stretch in the Malwa region, aside from growing soybean and chana, also grow a range of spices and medicinal plants like methi , dhaniya (coriander), jeera (cumin) and ajwain (carom seeds). Yet, farmers in the region claim that prices for these cash crops have been falling for the past few years. We never sold methi below Rs. 4,000 per quintal during the Manmohan Singhs government. But ever since Modi became PM, methi prices have collapsed, says Dinesh, showing methi gunny bags stored in his house.In addition to low prices, what has aggravated the situation is the Central governments demonetisation move late last year that has adversely hit the rural and agrarian economy.  Notebandi has almost finished us in the rural areas. Even after selling our produce, we dont get money in our hands before at least two-three weeks and sometimes even a month, says Lalchand Mali, a farmer from Barkheda Panth.Interestingly, not many farmers in the region are seeking loan waiver as is being claimed in the media. Most of them want better and remunerative prices that cover their costs and provide them income for survival. Believe me, no true farmer would want loan waiver. If the government provides better prices, we will repay our debt. The problem is the government never provides better prices, adds Lalchand, who owns a two-hectare plot in the village.The Maharashtra stirIn the town of Niphad in Maharashtras Nashik district, the main vegetable market, located in a large yard opposite the tehsil office, lies deserted. In a series of godowns that lie adjacent to the yard there is a pink gleam as sunlight filters through to large sacks of onions that are waiting to be transported. In Vittal Sanaps godown, which is nearly packed to capacity with produce, a large truck with a tarpaulin cover has been parked inside for three days even as workers go about their usual task of loading onions into bright red sacks.We had an order for onions to go to Madras (Chennai) a few days back but the truck was accosted on the road before it could get to Nashik and all the onions were dumped on the road, says Sanap. Onions that are left at the mercy of the elements lose their value almost immediately, so for now Sanap is just waiting for things to tide over. The hartal (strike) will have to end soon because there are many farmers who have no choice but to sell their goods even if prices are bad.Onions and other vegetables from godowns like Sanaps go to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) market in Nashik from where they are taken to other cities in Maharashtra like Mumbai and Pune as well as to other States in the south like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, and even Sri Lanka. The APMC market in Nashik is appropriately mammoth  on either side of a dusty road are two large open halls, each the size of a large bus terminus with tall pillars running right through. On June 8, a day after the one-week strike called by farmers in the region officially ended, a small group of women have set up shop to sell vegetables like cabbage, chillies, tomatoes and cucumber. They take up barely a quarter of one hall but as produce is brought in by farmers in smaller trucks, there are murmurs of anger outside with some arguments breaking out as the produce is passed inside. These women are not from Maharashtra, you can tell from their earrings that they are from Rajasthan. These are just small local farmers who want to break the strike, says one of the men. Still, even these small traces of activity raise the suspicion that divisions are beginning to form in what was till now a unified movement in the district.United in adversityAs the major commercial supplier in this region, Nashik may have become the epicentre of the farmers movement but it all started in a village called Puntamba in Ahmednagar district three months ago on April 3, when the villages gram panchayat passed a resolution warning of a Shetkari Sampa (Strike of the Ryots) from June 1. Their charter of demands addressed to Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis included ensuring crop procurement prices at least 50% above production costs, a complete waiver of farm loans, 100% subsidy on drip/sprinkler irrigation systems, and a minimum milk purchase price of Rs. 50.Farmers across the region may find a specific resonance in one or the other of these demands but what seems to have really helped the movement spread from Puntamba across the Nashik-Ahmednagar-Pune stretch of Maharashtra is the language in which the idea of the strike was communicated. Farmers face many hardships but this was the first time Ive seen farmers actually willing to go on strike to and risk everything to see that they are given some recognition, says Abhijit Dige, who owns an eight-acre farm about 60 km from Nashik. Politicians dont know what farmers go through, its not like other businesses. Devendra Fadnavis should come and work in the field for 14 hours a day, work at night in the cold to tend to onion crops, and then maybe hell understand, he says.That same sentiment is echoed by Deepak Rane who has a one-acre farm just off Niphad where he grows cauliflower. The strike should not stop because people dont realise what we go through. I am not able to recover the cost that I bear to treat my crops with chemicals and fertilizers. I work from 6 in the morning; what is it all for? he says.People from all walks of life face hardships but have you ever considered why it is only farmer suicides you have heard of? asks Dinesh Nikam, another trader in Nashik who has refused to take orders for onions and other vegetables because he says he stands in solidarity with the farmers.The illusion of prosperityWhen farm distress was first reported in Maharashtra, it focussed mainly on the prices of tur and arhar dal and the difficulties faced by farmers in the drought-prone Marathwada and Amaravati regions. After two years of consecutive drought, a good monsoon in 2016 brought in a bountiful harvest and the markets were simply swamped with produce. Record harvests were offset by a steep fall in procurement prices for both crops.The plight of those farmers is often referenced by prominent leaders of the movement in Nashik and Ahmednagar though it has to be noted that this region is substantially different. The stretch from Ahmednagar to Nashik, and down to Kolhapur and Sangli where the movement spread is a fairly contiguous belt that is home to relatively more prosperous farmers. The majority of farmers in the region over the past two decades have moved from cultivation of crops like bajra (pearl millet) and jowar (sorghum) to cash crops like grapes and onions. Many have invested in dairy farming (Puntamba, for instance, is home to many dairy farmers).Vegetables, then, are actually only a small part of the produce from this region and while the enduring visual images of the strike may be of vegetables like cauliflower and cabbage being dumped on the road, there are many places where people show us pictures shot on cell phones of roads lined with pomegranates, which is the most recent entry to the crop market here.In Italy, for instance, a village about 10 km from Niphad that was the one of the centres of the agitation, Swarupananda Bhorgade says that about 80% of the village of 5,000-odd farmers is involved in grape farming, sometimes done in rotation with onions. I have been growing grapes for the last 20 years and till about seven or eight years ago I used to sell it for about Rs. 50 a kilo, says Bhorgade. So it was only natural that I planted grapes on every inch of my 15 acres. Now it costs me about Rs. 15 to harvest a kilo of grapes and all I can get on the market is Rs. 9 to Rs. 18 a kilo, he says.Bhorgade attributes this to a number of factors, the most important of which is climate  storms would come unseasonably and the crops would be destroyed. Or there would be hailstorms. This past year, the weather was regular and the crop was good for once but there is no price. You have to take into account how much we have spent on growing these crops and how we will recover it. It costs a lot to invest in crops like grapes and pomegranates, he says, adding that farmers from the region initially tried to rope in their counterparts from Amaravati who grew tur dal but their situation was completely different. They have larger landholdings and their crop is rain-fed. They dont have to spend on irrigation and other chemicals and fertilizer like we do.On June 3, a faction of farmer leaders decided to call off the strike after Mr. Fadnavis announced a partial loan waiver for small and marginal farmers that would come into effect on October 31. In a large meeting on June 8 in Nashik that included about 3,000 farmers and 150 representatives of farmer associations from across the State, that compromise was rejected. The people who met the Chief Minister did so late at night without anybody knowing and the agreement was not along the lines of what we were originally demanding, said Raju Shetti, president of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana that has taken a major role in advancing the agenda. If the government did not accede to the demand to waive all loans immediately and bump up procurement prices, the meeting decided that the strike would move to a new phase of hartals across district and collectors offices from June 12 and rail rokos  in some areas. As of June 8, the meeting concluded that farmers should be allowed to take their produce to the market in order to meet their minimum needs. Look for Puntamba on that day (June 12), says one of the farmers who attended the meeting. The first rail roko will be there, where it all started."

Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam, the prices would continue to be high for at least the next two months.As of now, the production is less. The prices are shooting up as the demand is high as there are muhurtham days this month. We will have to wait for fresh yield and supply of vegetables to see if the prices dip, he said.On Tuesday, the cost of a few vegetables offered some consolation. Tomato, carrot and beetroot were priced less when compared to other vegetables, he added.A kilo of tomato was priced at Rs. 15 to Rs. 20, while earlier the previous rate was Rs. 20 to Rs. 22. Carrot costs Rs. 30 to Rs. 40, while beetroot costs Rs. 20. He pointed out that most of the other vegetables were dearer.A kilo of onion cost Rs. 12 to Rs. 18, while small onion cost Rs. 80 to Rs. 100 and potato was priced at Rs. 15 to Rs. 20. Brinjal (thorny variety) cost Rs. 50 a kilo, while drumstick cost Rs. 20 to Rs. 30.Beans were priced high at Rs. 60 to Rs. 80 due to poor yield during summer.

Discussion has revolved around an apparent paradox: why are farmers rioting after a bumper crop? But any student of economics knows that prices fall after bumper harvests, which is good for consumers but terrible for farmers. This is why the government needs to step in to buy from farmers at a minimum support price, while subsidising consumers so that they get affordable food. This is what we have done over the last fifty years after setting up the Food Corporation of India (FCI) in 1965.If this system has been in place for so long, why are we still lurching from crisis to crisis? For long, we have said that the solution is to get people off farming. While there is no doubt we need to create more jobs in manufacturing, we must not forget that even in the year 2050, according to the latest projections, there will still be 800 million people living in rural India. And just one look at the state of Indian cities makes it clear that endlessly moving people from villages to cities could actually deepen the urban imbroglio. So solutions have to be found for agriculture  and fast.Use and abuse of soil, waterThe problem with Indian agriculture is that we are still stuck with the so-called Green Revolution of the 1970s. I use the prefix so-called for a specific reason. Yes, there was a dramatic rise in food production. And India no longer needs to beg for food in the world market. But this was primarily a rice and wheat revolution. It completely neglected two-thirds of Indian agriculture and crops grown and eaten by the poorest people of our country  pulses and millets. There is also nothing green about this revolution because, over the years, it has caused a deep crisis of sustainability, economic and ecological. Large-scale use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides has had an extremely adverse impact on our soil and water. Deep drilling by tubewells to grow these water-intensive crops has happened without any reference whatsoever to Indias unique hydrogeology, where nearly two-thirds of our land is underlain by hard rock formations which have very low rates of natural recharge.This has meant that there is now a serious water crisis, with both water tables and water quality falling rapidly. We have arsenic, fluoride, mercury, even uranium in our drinking water, creating serious health issues. What is worse, to get the same increase in production, farmers have had to apply more and more fertilisers and pesticides over time. This dramatically raises costs of cultivation, without a proportionate increase in production. More than 3,00,000 farmers have committed suicide over the last two decades, which has absolutely no precedent in Indian history.Sustainable agricultureSo what can we do to address these twin tragedies of suicides and violence by farmers? First, we need to transition to a more ecologically resilient agriculture. This becomes even more urgent in the context of climate change. Large-scale evidence now exists that non-chemical agriculture has become a profitable alternative. As farmers reduce their dependence on synthetic fertilisers and pesticides, they slowly emerge from the ecological vicious cycle and are also able to dramatically reduce their costs of cultivation, without compromising on production. The biggest votary of non-chemical farming is the Prime Minister himself. He has also launched the Soil Health Card Scheme, which potentially enables farmers to more carefully manage input regimes. The government must announce a comprehensive package to give a green direction to the nature of subsidies in the sector.Second, we must radically reform the management of both surface and groundwater to ensure that the water in our irrigation commands reaches the farmers for whom it is meant and groundwater is managed sustainably in a way that ensures that no one is deprived of their right to water for life. There is positive movement in both these directions within government except for some hesitation in going ahead with a new model groundwater Bill drafted by the Ministry of Water Resources. This landmark Bill seeks to replace archaic British Common Law from the 19th century, which has provided legal legitimacy to the over-extraction of groundwater that underpins the current agrarian crisis. The new law needs urgent adoption and advocacy with the States by the Government of India.On diversificationThird, we require continued diversification to other forms of livelihood, such as livestock and fisheries, among the fastest-growing segments of the rural economy, which could be hurt by recent policy changes. We must also shift focus away from water-intensive rice and wheat. This means radical changes in the way we grow these crops (seed, water and input regimes) but also much greater encouragement to millets and pulses, which are nutritionally far superior alternatives in a country beset with the diabetes epidemic. The key change required here is aggressive and extensive procurement of these crops by the government. FCI procurement focusses only on rice and wheat although this year we saw some initial steps in the direction of procurement of pulses. This is a welcome move but needs to go much further. The best way would be to include millets and pulses in the massive anganwadi and mid-day meal programmes.Fourth, investments in agro-processing infrastructure are urgently required that would enable farmers to move up the value chain. We cannot continue to have them dumping their vegetables and milk on the road. They should be processed before they are sold and farmers must get their due share in the value chain.Fifth, we need to ensure access to credit and crop insurance, especially to our 85% small and marginal farmers. This is why I am strongly opposed to farm loan waivers as they destroy the integrity of the banking system and potentially undermine the extraordinary anti-poverty initiative led by Self-Help Groups (SHGs) of women across the country. So many of these extremely poor women, with more than 97% loan recovery ratios, have helped the banking system survive in remote rural India. All this great work of providing an alternative to the usurious moneylender-traders is threatened by loan waivers.Finally, we need strong Farmer Producer Organisations, to overcome massive handicaps faced by isolated farmers and enable them to really benefit from market participation.Demonetisation crunchWhile many cumulative factors have taken a toll on farmers over decades, more proximate factors explain the outbreak of extreme violence. Speaking to farmers and traders, it appears that demonetisation squeezed so much liquidity out of the system that traders did not have requisite cash to buy the farmers produce. Farmers also feel that persisting with imports, even after clear signs of a bumper harvest, further depressed prices. Having lived in remote rural Madhya Pradesh for the last three decades, I do not recall a crash in prices as dramatic as this years, that too in the peak of summer. In Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka, prices of tuar, gram, soybean, grapes, potatoes, onions, tomatoes, milk, garlic, cumin, coriander and fenugreek are at historical lows. And when this happens in crops with high costs of cultivation and inadequate government support, the impact is catastrophic, leading to what the Reserve Bank of India has called fire sales. Which has also created apprehensions about kharif sowing. No wonder the farmers are upset.Violence shows no way forward. But this is a juncture agrarian policy reform in India cannot afford to ignore. Only a comprehensive policy response can ensure that farmers distress becomes a thing of the past.Mihir Shah, a member of the erstwhile Planning Commission, has lived in remote rural Madhya Pradesh for the last three decades, working on issues of water and livelihood security"

Besides, the vegetables are not being exported across the border. The export was allowed for three days this season and prices had suddenly gone up, but it was then closed, said Mr. Pahuja.Devidas, another commission agent, said that the prices of potatoes, onions and lemons had also fallen sharply compared to last year.Potatoes were being sold at Rs. 20 per kg in December last year, but now their prices have nose-dived to Rs. 5-6 per kg. Similarly, onions are now selling for Rs. 7-8 per kg compared to Rs. 10-12 last year. Lemon is selling at Rs. 15 per kg whereas it was Rs. 35-40 per kg last year. The sales have also decreased to half, further taking a toll on our profit margins, said Devidas, proprietor of Sahil Fruits and Vegetables Company.The commission agents, however, said that the farmers had suffered the brunt of the situation.The farmer gets around Rs. 4 per kg for tomatoes. He not able to even recover his cost. The farmers in Jharkhand a few months ago dumped tonnes of tomatoes on the roads after the price fell to just 50 paisa per kg. Same thing happened in Chhattisgarh, said Mr. Pahuja.Food for thoughtVegetables such as tomatoes and potatoes are now grown in every part of the country so the supply has increased. But it is not financially viable for the government to buy them at higher rate and sell at lower rate in the market. When the prices increase there is hue and cry and the governments are forced to act. Governments fall over rise in prices. But no one cares when the farmer suffers due to fall in prices, said Tara Chand, one of the largest wholesale dealers in the mandi.Governments fall over rise in prices, but no one cares when the farmer suffers due to fall in pricesTara ChandVegetable dealer"

An estimated 500 acres are brought under these vegetables in Kumaravadi, Aanangarayanpatti, Koambapatti, Pillaiyarnatham, Thulakkampatti, Nadupatti, Kallupatti, Karungulam and Edayapatti.The arrival of a few vegetables has virtually stopped for the past three months, indicating the nil yield in the fields, says K. Guna, one of the wholesale dealers of Vaiyampatti. Among them, brinjal, ridgegourd and beans are some of the vegetables which have not come to the wholesale mandy for the past few months. All these crops require periodical but intensive irrigation facility.Since the ground water table had gone down far below 100 feet, not many farmers have come forward to burn their finger by raising the crop.He said that farmers have skipped the vegetable crops for the past two pattams (Thai pattam and Vaikasi pattam).Another wholesale dealer, A. Anbu says he has been complacent with the arrival of mangoes.Never in the past two decades my mandi has witnessed such a deserted situation, he says.A cluster of wholesale markets are located near the bus stand in Vaiyampatti and brisk activity was seen in the past from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. daily at these wholesale markets, with farmers bringing the produce and the merchants or their agents from Tiruchi, Dindigul and Ottanchathiram loading the vegetables immediately. But, on Monday, the vegetable markets wore a dull look.The poor arrival of vegetables at the wholesale market has, in turn, affected the mini-van operators who used to transport the produce from Vaiyampatti to different places within the district and also to Dindigul and Madurai districts.Malayan, one of the operators, said that a large number of vans and taxis can be seen parked at the vehicle stand opposite the bus stand.The economy of the village largely depended on the wholesale markets.He said that most of the van operators were idling at the stand."

Until the 1970s, there used to be a flourishing trade in dried fruits and nuts across the border here. All thats over now. What we have instead is a Retreat Ceremony along the lines of Wagah. The evening I was there people crowded into the stands on both sides, waving flags and singing songs. The soldiers did their little dramatic routine, playing to the galleries with grimaces, boot-stomping and hoisted rifles. They were cheered raucously, the more aggressive the posturing, the louder the applause. Except perhaps for two or three people, everybody else was thrilled with all this display of patriotic belligerence.A dualityFor the armed forces, the performance is just another day at work. Backstage, soldiers from both sides rehearse together, exchange snacks and movie CDs, and peaceably send back goatherds who stray across the border. The amity as well as the swagger at sundown are real, and if war breaks out tomorrow, the killing will be as real. Its a duality they live with. But for a gullible audience that does not have the benefit of nuance, viewing a faux skirmish such as this is to imagine an always hostile enemy. It actively stokes bloodthirstiness.On a larger scale, on mass and social media platforms, just such a stoking is going on  a crude and constant invoking of a bogeyman, a rage always kept at boiling point.Soldiers, who had so far stayed away from political grandstanding, have today been hauled into television studios and Twitter timelines and forced into the same false binary as everyone else  with us or against us, nationalist or anti-national, patriot or traitor. Forcing them to play to the gallery is doing the security forces a huge disservice, and this government has dragged them into the very public and simplistic us versus them debate just as cynically as governments down the years have dragged them into conflicts planted and watered by politicians.Unfortunately, in the Kashmir Valley today, as elsewhere, it is precisely an easy, populist binary that is not available to the armed forces. Who are us and who are them? Citizen, terrorist, insurgent, provocateur, informer  they are all mixed up in one bag.That eventful day, Major Leetul Gogoi broke ethical rules of engagement but, equally, he was an ordinary young man functioning in extraordinary circumstances. It is surprising the Army should have reacted by honouring him rather than acknowledging it as an aberration, but one wonders how much such reactions are forced by a climate where military-political lines are being calculatedly blurred, and by the shrillness of debate that insists on black and white answers to murky grey questions.Sophisticated cynicism regardless, for an overwhelming majority, the abstraction of nation will always be represented by the easy symbolism of soil, flag and anthem. These sentiments drive the soldier too. Quoting Tolstoy calling patriotism stupid and immoral might be intellectually correct, but it is facile and ignores the soldier.This person has undergone years of intense training, a reconditioning of a person into an automaton to succeed in war. Ideals of flag and country have been drilled in so deep that he is willing to lay down his life unquestioningly for these. How do you invoke a borderless world or the idea of nation as sham for this person?Every argument that intellectualises the idea of nationhood without contextualising it enough drives the wedge deeper into the false binary. Worse, it plays into the hands of the jingoistic, desk-bound patriot-politicians who have conveniently made the armed forces the face of the dispute. And its a role the forces are increasingly and naively accepting because it seems like recognition after decades of bureaucratic neglect and mistreatment.Faced with cinematic posturing on one side that claims to respect the soldier and by a dissociated condescension on the other, no prizes for guessing where the soldier imagines salvation lies.The discussion around the Kashmir Valley has now become so much about theories of nationalism, about grandstanding on one or the other side, that the conflict itself has been normalised. By either constantly foregrounding the soldiers martyrdom or by casually demonising the soldier, we are conveniently forgetting to ask why the soldier is there in the first place.Surely it would be wise now for the generals to remember that finding solutions in the Kashmir Valley is not the Armys job, but the governments.vaishna.r@thehindu.co.in"

He is convinced that it is his old city (forget the fact that he has not lived there for decades) which has the best Muslim cuisine in India.

But I must admit that my Hyderabadi friend has a point. That the cuisine has been enriched by the royal family of Hyderabad  the Nizams  is an undisputable fact.In fact, the biryani that I love the most is the kuchchey gosht ki biryani from Hyderabad. Long years ago, another friend who grew up in Hyderabad would make it a point to come back to Delhi with tubs of biryani from his home city every time he went on a visit there. And we would devour it in silence, and thank him profusely  but only after wed eaten every morsel, for we raced to see who could eat the most at the shortest possible time.I was reminded of that glorious biryani some days ago when a friend at ITC Maurya invited me to a royal festival that the hotel has been organising. Every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, there is a banquet at The Pavilion celebrating the food of a former royal family  of Sailana and Hyderabad (which are over), Akheraj (June 16-18), Kangra (June 23-25), Kashmir (June 30-July 2), Rampur (July 7-9) and Bhainsrogarh (July 14-15).Heart of malai!I enjoy the food of Kangra, though, after spending several weeks there, way back in the eighties, I must admit I got a bit tired of the khatti dal that I ate every day and everywhere. I have had great encounters with Kashmiri, Rampuri and Sailana royal food. I recall eating a kabab cooked with the guler fruit and a shikampuri kabab, with a heart of malai (instead of hung curd), prepared by the Sailana scion in Delhi some years ago. The taar korma of Rampur is an eternal favourite, and I enjoy everything Kashmiri from the gushtaba to the rishta.But I think my favourite is still the food of Hyderabad. The Salar Jung festival at the hotel included some of the best known Hyderabadi dishes  including kachchey goshti ki biryani and hari mirch murgh masala. The biryani was the way I like it, fragrant rice, perfectly spiced and with deliciously tender pieces of meat. In this style of cooking, the juices of the meat get infused in the rice, and I suppose that is why I enjoy it so much.The chicken dish was excellent, sharp in taste and pleasant to look at, thanks to the green chillies, and a taste of tamarind and mustard. There was a paneer timatari  cooked in a nicely tart tomato curry. What I also enjoyed was the arbi kalimirch  a dry dish of arbi that had been in coated with carom seeds and black pepper.Surprisingly, the dish that didnt appeal to me was the jafrani machli, cooked in yoghurt and an almond paste. I found the gravy too thick, and the fish itself much too bland.I think the festival should have included the royal food of Bhopal. I find their rezala, mildly green in colour because of the use of coriander and mint leaves deliciously different. Theres a school of thought (based in Bhopal, of course), which believes that the royal food of Bhopal is particularly good because unlike elsewhere, begums were the rulers there.But I am not getting into this war of whose royal food is the best. Let them all bloom, and happily tickle our palates. And my Hyderabadi friend can turn his nose up as much as he wishes to."

India and Israel are not immune to it either. We are in full agreement that elements which perpetrate violence on innocent people should not be allowed to flourish, Modi said.Here is the complete text of the interview, as released by Israel Hayom:Q) What do you know about Israel? Have you ever visited Israel?A) I got firsthand experience of Israel during my visit to Israel in 2006, as chief minister of the Indian State of Gujarat, to take part in an Agritech exhibition. I am happy to return after more than a decade, and I look forward to seeing the developments and advances Israel has made in this time.I share the view of many of my fellow citizens about Israel. In India, Israel is perceived as a technological powerhouse, and a country that has braved many odds. Many tech-based inventions have their roots in Israeli universities and laboratories and have benefited humankind. These include articles ranging from USB flash drives to cherry tomatoes. The way you transformed yourself from being a water-deficient country to a water-surplus country; the manner in which you made your deserts bloom, are all amazing accomplishments. All these images have made a deep imprint on my mind.Q) Why have you made a decision to go ahead with this historic visit?A) Bilateral ties between our countries have always been strong. In fact, over the years, they have been continuously expanding and diversifying. In the recent past, the steady strengthening of our ties has begun finding reflection and reinforcement in high-level visits. You would have noticed that the frequency of exchanges has gone up over the last three years. No Indian president or prime minister had visited Israel before our president visited in 2015. President Reuven Rivlins visit to India in 2016 was only the second Israeli presidential visit to India.My forthcoming visit reminds us of the deep and centuries old connect between our societies. It is in line with our view that our ties should be reflected in all spheres of our engagement and backed by regular high-level contact. I think that this year, as we celebrate 25 years of our diplomatic relations, it is an opportune occasion to take the relationship to a new level.Q) Does this decision imply a more pro-Israel posture in the UN?A) Our positions at the U.N. are based on the merit of specific issues and driven by our core values and principles. We remain engaged with all our partners, including Israel, in finding optimal outcomes at the U.N. and other multilateral fora that reflect our commonly shared priorities and concerns. India is not in favor of singling out any country at the U.N.Q)Does India still consider itself unaligned with either the West or the East?A) We believe in the philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, which means the world is one family. We want to engage constructively with both the East and the West.Q) Are Israel and India facing the same threat of terrorism?A) Terrorism is a global menace. India and Israel are not immune to it either. We are in full agreement that elements which perpetrate violence on innocent people should not be allowed to flourish. Cross-border terrorism is a major challenge for us. Divisive forces across our border are trying to disrupt the unity of our nation. These troublemakers often misuse religion as a tool to misguide youth in our country and our regions. Terrorism should not be equated with any particular religion. India and Israel could cooperate even more closely and complement each others efforts to fight with the menace of terrorism.Q) Is this a reset or an upgrade of relations?A) My visit has its own significance as this is the first time ever that an Indian PM is visiting Israel. I am confident that my visit will lead to further strengthening of our relations in different areas and also open up new priorities for cooperation.Q) Will you agree to visit Jerusalem and the Western Wall like President Donald Trump?A) The principal objective of my visit is to deepen bilateral relations between India and Israel. I am sure I will visit Jerusalem. Elements of my visit and its program is being so arranged so that we can focus to taking forward our partnership with Israel in all the spheres, including technology and innovation links, agriculture and efficient resource use. Q) What is your position on the question of sovereignty in Jerusalem? Will India move its embassy?A) We believe in a two-state solution in which both Israel and a future Palestinian state coexist peacefully. A final-status agreement should respect the sentiments and address demands of all affected parties. The key to finding a solution to this issue lies with the affected parties. India supports all efforts to find an acceptable solution to all the pending issues, including Jerusalem. I assume the question refers to our embassy in Tel Aviv. We will take a decision on that after both sides have come to an agreement on Jerusalem.Q) Your biography, as a man who grew up in poverty and climbed up the ladder with hard work to become the countrys head of government, is impressive by any measure. But despite your past, you are an ardent supporter of the capitalist system and want to liberalize the economy. Can you explain what shaped your worldview?A) I do not believe in any -isms. I, and my government work with the motto of Together with all, development for all. We want our youth to become not just job-seekers but job-givers. We will adopt all measures necessary to unlock the innovation and entrepreneurial potential of our youth. My yardstick for supporting or advocating any course of action is the net benefit or value it brings to the lives of our people. And when this consideration is put first, the results can be deeply rewarding. I have seen that in my own home state, Gujarat in Western India, where I was the chief minister for 13 years, and now on the national scale in India.Q) You have tried to reform Indian society, in part by the use of modern technology in remote and rural communities that lack proper sanitary conditions. Can Israel play a role in this?A) Certainly. Israel could be a technology partner in this process of transformation. Israels capabilities offer a good match for our flagship schemes like Clean Ganga [the effort to clean the Ganges River] and Smart Cities. Israeli technologies could also be used to improve the quality of lives of hundreds of thousands of people in our country if Israeli innovators remodel their products according to the needs of our rural population. It is important to understand market trends among the rural sections.Q) What is the difference between the approach Israelis and Indians have when it comes to business, agriculture and other fields?A) As societies, India and Israel are both driven by a strong entrepreneurial mindset. Business cultures in the two countries are unique and have evolved from their respective context in which each has evolved. There may be differences in their approach but the Indian and Israeli businessmen whom I know have told me that both have similar scientific temperament.Q) How can we describe to the average person what innovation ties are there between Israelis and Indians?A) I think the average person is highly aware of our innovation ties as the outcome of our engagement touches his life. Our perspective on innovation may be varied by but we both rely on it to add wealth and value to our societies. Israelis and Indians are innovative by birth. India and Israel both support and sustain unique innovation ecosystems. Our common effort is also to link the creativity of innovation with the energy of entrepreneurship.Q) What kind of Israeli imports does India seek?A) We are not looking at a traditional import-export relationship with Israel. It is more than a buyer-seller relationship. We are more interested in a tech-based partnership with an emphasis on Make in India. The Israeli industry has been fairly positive to many of our flagship schemes like Clean Ganga. There is tremendous scope for deepening the extent of partnership in Indias flagship schemes."

The prices of several vegetables have spiralled this month, as a result. Even a bunch of mint and coriander leaves costs Rs. 40 due to the severe water crisis in places in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka where the plants are grown.Traders at the Koyambedu market said the market now receives only up to 250 truck loads of vegetables daily compared to the usual 350-400 trucks. S. Chandran, president, Koyambedu Market Licensed Merchants Association, said several vegetables are now at least 40% costlier than last month. Usually, the prices of vegetables that escalate during summer begin to drop from mid-June. But, as the drought situation continues across the State and also in neighbouring States, vegetables may remain expensive till July, he said.Onion, tomato and potato are the only vegetables that are priced at Rs. 20-Rs. 25 per kg. Cabbage and snake gourd are also being preferred more by some customers as they are priced at Rs. 20-Rs. 30 a kg in the wholesale market. Several customers have cut down on their volume of purchase. Beans and carrots are expensive.Low yieldP.Sukumar, joint secretary, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flower Merchants Welfare Association, said: Even the locally grown green chillies and brinjals are priced high this month as the yield is less across the State. Vegetable prices have been increasing for three months. But Ramzan has helped to keep sales up, he said."

The farmers of main crops such as rice, turmeric, millets, bajra and all horticulture crops could manage only 50 % of their regular production this season. This has affected the arrival of vegetables to the farmers shandies and other markets in the district.Due to the steep fall in the arrival, the prices of vegetables have shot up by about 30 % in the shandies, according to official sources.Small onionThe price of small onion remained as high as Rs. 100 per kg in the shandies and also in the open markets.The price of tomato that stood at Rs. 15 last week, rose to Rs. 22 per kg on Friday in the shandies; the price of carrot has gone up to Rs. 72 from Rs. 60 last week.Similarly the price of beans stood at Rs. 70 per kg; brinjal stood at Rs. 36 per kg; ladies finger Rs. 30; chillies Rs. 46; potato Rs. 24; raddish Rs. 25; beans Rs. 70; snake gourd Rs. 28; flat beans Rs. 50; beetroot Rs. 40, and cabbage Rs. 28.However, the price of big onion has registered a downward trend. The onion is priced between Rs. 15 and Rs. 18 per kg.A cross section of the farmers who market their produce in the farmers shandies said the price of all the vegetables invariably has increased in the last one-and-a-half month, due to fall in production. The prices of the vegetables are expected to continue to remain high for the next one month or so, they added."
5a060e0f9855b76bf13c343c,Why you don’t feel the record-low inflation,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/why-you-dont-feel-the-record-low-inflation/article19100813.ece,2017-06-19,,The Hindu,"It is not just RBIs forecasters who are likely to be scratching their heads after the release of Indias latest retail inflation numbers for May 2017. Aam aadmi is quite bewildered too. The data shows that the inflation rate, measured by the Consumer Price Index (Combined  new series) was 2.2% for May 2017, slipping from a 3% reading for April which everyone thought was the rock-bottom. The food component of the index actually deflated by 1.1%.A CPI inflation rate below 2.5% is a once-in-a-blue-moon occurrence in India. Looking back at the history of the CPI  Industrial Workers (the older avatar of the index which has a longer history), we find that India has registered CPI inflation of less than 2.5% only in 12 months in 20 years.But if retail inflation is at a stand-still, how come most of us dont feel it? Shouldnt this be boosting our purchasing power and visibly fattening our wallets?There are three reasons why your personal experience with price rise may not gel with the official reading.Where you liveIf you live in Jammu & Kashmir, Puducherry or Sikkim, the inflation rates in your household budget may bear no resemblance to the headline inflation number.This is because the All-India CPI Combined is compiled by collecting town and village-level data on the prices of goods and services across States and then aggregating them.Now, all States and Union Territories do not get equal weighting in the total. The weights are decided by the consumption expenditure within each State relative to the all-India consumption basket. While the State of Maharashtra gets a 13.2% weight in the all-India CPI (Combined), J&K weighs in with just 0.94%, Puducherry with 0.17% and Sikkim with 0.05%.In effect, price trends at Maharashtra carry nearly 260 times the influence that Sikkim carries in deciding the final CPI number. Runaway inflation in Indias less populous low-spend States and Union Territories is unlikely to show up in the form of a big swing in the overall index. But even small blips in the States of Maharashtra (13.1% weight), UP (12.4%) and Tamil Nadu (7.3%) can swing the headline number.This is why, in May 2017, CPI inflation at J&K (6.3%), Delhi (5.1%) and Himachal Pradesh (4.7%) ruled at many times the all-India reading of 2.2%.Consumption basketDoes 45.8% of your monthly household budget go towards food and groceries? Would house rent makeup just 10.1%? Do you fritter away 2.4% on tobacco and intoxicants? If not, the inflation in your household is likely to be very different from the official inflation rate.In order to arrive at a CPI General Index that is representative of both India and Bharat, the statistics office assigns different weights to the different products and services. These weights are derived from the actual spending patterns of rural and urban households as captured by the NSSOs ground-level survey of expenditure patterns across India. The latest such survey was the 68th round conducted over 2011-12. (See graphic).Because the majority of Indian households belong to lower-income strata, the CPI General Index thus carries a far higher weight to products than services.Services often witness higher price rise than products in the Indian context. But in practise, more affluent households will tend to spend a far lower proportion of their income on food and essentials and make a higher allocation to non-essentials and services.One-offsThe official CPI print captures the point-to-point change in the index in the latest month, compared to the same month last year. This makes the number susceptible to distortions from one-off factors both in the base month and in the current one.The CPI inflation rate for May 2017 has, for instance, been suppressed by the base effect. As we know, a bountiful monsoon this year has led to a bumper production of pulses, oilseeds and horticultural crops. This has triggered a rout in agri-commodities ranging from tur and urad dal to potatoes, onions and tomatoes, prompting farmers to protest. Agri-market watchers also add that the note ban and GST impact on the agri-supply chain have led to poor offtake and offloading of stock, thus adding to this downward spiral.But a fall in retail food prices at this time of the year is quite a one-off situation. Every year, food prices usually soar in the months of April-May as they represent the pre-monsoon months when food crops are in short supply. In May last year, for instance, two consecutive poor monsoon years had fuelled a sharp flare-up in the prices of pulses, oilseeds, vegetables and spices. In May 2016, therefore the item-wise breakdown of CPI showed the prices of pulses up 33% (year-on-year), vegetables higher by 10% and spices rising 9%.But in May 2017, the respective CPI index for vegetables was down by 13%, that for pulses had plunged 15% and fruits and oils were up by just 1-2% compared to the same time last year.If we ignore the monthly numbers and focus on three-year trends instead, we find that price levels have continued to creep up steadily. Between May 2014 and now, the CPI Combined has risen at an annual 4.5%.Food prices in this span have climbed 4.1%. In the preceding three-year span from 2011 to 2014, the CPI Combined had soared 9.6% and the CPI Food Index 10.9%.In short, yes, inflation has moderated of late, but for most middle class folk, it is likely to be higher than 2.2%. To get a real feel of your personal inflation rate, you should check out CPI trends in your State of residence, and in the products and services that make up the lions share of your budget.If we focus on three-year trends, we find that price levels have gone up steadily"

It requires eight months of growth and the tuber grows on vines and underneath the soil.With low sugar content and high calories, it is advisable for diabetics too. It can be kept for a year and its taste appeals to children, says Peter. A single plant yielded 12 kg adathappu last year, he says, pointing to a sapling in front of his house.Like many endemic tuber species, adathappu too was on the path of oblivion. Peter then started cultivating them with other traditional vegetable varieties that too faced extinction.Among them were native brinjal, ladies finger, chilly and tomato varieties.It was his interest in conserving native plant varieties and animals that led Peter, an instructor at an engineering college, to take up farming as a vocation.He liberally shares the seeds of crops and vegetables with farmers. Only if other farmers too grow them can our vast traditional species be protected, he says.Pest-resistantThe traditional species may not be highly profitable for farmers but they score on pest resistance and adaptability to climatic changes when compared to hybrid varieties, he says.Peter collected his plant and animal wealth over a decade of search, most of them from tribal settlements.Some tribes and traditional agriculture families still protect their seed wealth, which is the only reason for their survival. With the change in food habits, many vegetable varieties have disappeared from the culinary table, Peter says. One can spot native varieties of cattle such as High Range Dwarf, Vechur Cow, goat species of Malabar, and nadan kapri and karinkozhy chicken species at his farm.An important feature of our animal wealth was its adaptability to the topographical condition of a particular area like the High Range Dwarf. However, it is confined to some pockets and needs protection, he says."

Many of the eateries in rural areas have done away with serving tomato chatni.The horticulture farmers of Vazhappadi and surrounding areas usually raised tomatoes, brinjal, bhendi, avarai, pumpkin, drumstick, raddish, snakegourd, kottavarai etc. Vazhappadi block is a major tomato production centre in the western belt.The daily market in Vazhappadi town received tomatoes round the year from the farmers of Vazhappadi and surrounding areas and also from Arunutrumalai and Kalvarayan hills. The traders from not only Salem district, but also from Namakkal, Villupuram, Cuddalore, too visit the Vazhappadi daily market for procuring the tomatoes through auction.Due to acute drought conditions, there has been a sharp fall in the production of tomatoes in Vazhappadi and in the Kalvarayan hills, leading to steep hike in its price.A box of tomatoes containing 25 to 28 kg which was priced at Rs. 600 by the end of last month, has gone up to Rs. 1,200 in the last two days. A 10-kg basket of country tomatoes are being marketed at Rs. 500.The tomatoes are being marketed at Rs. 60 in the local markets.According to M.G.R. Palaniswami, a wholesale dealer of tomatoes at Vazhappadi daily market, there has been a sharp fall in the arrival of tomatoes in the daily market for the past few days. Harvesting of tomatoes has come to an abrupt end in villages on the Kalvarayan hills. The Vazhappadi market daily market which was receiving about 600 boxes of tomatoes during last month, at present is receiving only 100 boxes.Mr. Palaniswami pleaded for a cold storage facility for storing the tomatoes during the peak season and market the same at reasonable price whenever there is shortfall in the arrival of the same from the villages. The farmers and traders have been pleading for this facility for a long and the government should take steps for commissioning this facility immediately, in the interest of both the farmers and consumers.The price of tomatoes have registered upward trend in uzhavar santhais too in the district.The price of the tomatoes which remained at Rs. 28 per kg last week has risen to Rs. 35 on Wednesday."

More than a month ago, Pudhu Vaazhvu Project introduced three mobile grocery shops for parts of the hills in Tiruvannamalai to reach the commodities to the villagers.In the past, consumers had to travel 20 km to Jamunamarathur to get groceries. Now, these shops-on-wheels take the groceries to their doorsteps. For instance, a villager from Puthur had to travel for 17 km to Jamunamarathur every Monday to get vegetables. They managed with this stock for three to four days of the week, said C. Sevathan, district project manager, Pudhu Vaazhvu project, Tiruvannamalai.The idea was mooted by Collector Prashant M. Wadnere during a hill area development meeting. The project officials responded to his idea with the concept of mobile grocery shops.The Collector asked us to discuss about how essential commodities can be taken to the doorstep of the villagers in the hills and that the services can be done through self-help groups (SHG). We discussed this with SHG members and three groups came forward. Following this, we rolled out three mobile grocery shops on May 20, he said.From then on, these SHG members, who were trained, have been running the show. They take the groceries in mini-vans to villages.Three unitsWhile Amutha and Sangeetha have teamed up to run the mobile shop in Puthur village in Nammiyampattu panchayat, Sivaperumal, a community disability facilitator, manages the shop at Gundalathur in Kovilur panchayat and two members  Shanti and Jayasudha  run the store at Velichanur at Melsilambadi panchayat.The three groups have invested about Rs. 17,000 to Rs. 25,000. While one group goes around the villages every day, two others visit on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday. They sell vegetables such as onions and tomatoes, fruits, tamarind, pulses, soaps, shampoos, biscuit packets and chocolates. All things sold in petty shops can be found in these mobile units, Mr. Sevathan added.He said the project through its scheme, Amudhasurabhi, has extended financial support in the form of loans to these groups.The official said the response for the mobile shops has been good among the villagers. They are happy that the groceries reach their doorsteps, he said."
5a06343e9855b76bf13c4324,The great avocado show,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/the-great-avocado-show/article19201494.ece,2017-07-03,,The Hindu,"You know a superfood has gained serious traction when it makes news, rages across Instagram, and has restaurant menus dedicated to it. The avocado, once happily married to onion, tomato, cilantro and lemon juice, in the humble guacamole, is the latest to get upwardly mobile. It has found its way from the first course in swanky eateries to the last. You can have it smashed, pulped, frozen, charred, tossed in a salad or blended into a shake.Hip millennials have raised its demand to the point where the avocado has become hot rather than humble, and its price point in India is comparable to anywhere in the world.In Mumbai to showcase the versatility of this ingredient is Australian chef Scott Pickett. In two varied techniques, Pickett shows that the avocado can be made to obey any instruction. It can excite your palate and fuel taste buds when simply charred and served with olive oil and salt or sugar. Conversely, it can cool you off at the end of a meal when whipped into a chocolate mousse and served with berries and cherries. Says Pickett, When you use it to make ice cream, you are replacing milk-based fat content with avocado.With great power comes talkThe avocados status as a superfood has made it a talking point over the last year, and not just in Australia alone.As Pickett observes, With the world being so much closer, thanks to social media and the Internet, superfoods that are popular become a simultaneous trend the world over.This is why, there are at least two avocado-themed restaurants worth mention. Amsterdam has locals and tourists mad for The Avocado Show, while Brooklyn, New York, has the Avocaderia. Both restaurants serve up avocado halves in place of burger buns in their burger, while the former even pairs it with hummus and toast, in a nod to the popular smashed avocado on toast. Theres avocado in side dishes as well  trussed up with truffles and oils, served with salmon and caviar, and even married into a burrata.Much as Pickett loves avocado, he isnt keen on forcing it into every bite you take at any of his four Melbourne restaurants.Reining in the fad, he says, I think there is a place for everything. It can definitely be part of a meal, but Im not sure if I would like everything avocado.Experimental muchSpeaking of how chefs and foodies are playing with their food in Australias foodie state of Victoria, where Pickett is from, he says that the lack of an established culinary history (like India has) means that the treatment of ingredients is always under scrutiny.Whos to say what ready means when it comes to avocado? We are actively developing ways to cook and use the fruit at different stages of readiness. If its firm, charring works great, and served as a side with the main meal.A ripple set off in Australia last year made waves all the way to the front pages of western media when Australian columnist Bernard Salt wrote that millennials were unable to afford homes because they were spending $20 on avocado on toast. The furore this generated across oceans simply had more people lining up to see what the fuss was all about. Smashed avocado gained street cred in kitchens everywhere. Now, the time is right, feels Pickett, to take the interest into creating dishes beyond his beloved smashed avocado on toast.Trend mentalityHe wouldnt go as far as the avo-latte though, which is a regular latte served in the skin of an avocado. It was created as a joke in Melbourne before cafs around the world sincerely followed suit. They missed the joke, grins Pickett. Doctors in the UK  where sales of the fruit shot up over the last year  have even coined a new condition called avo hand for the injury sustained from cutting avocados.While the most popular variety of avocado sold is called Hass  named after the American postal worker Rudolph Hass  the latest variety that everyones excited about is the Teeny Tiny Avocado, developed by Trader Joes. Its lime-sized, ripens faster than your regular avocado, and is a perfect single serving. However, it hasnt made its way to your local grocerToo much of anythingAs for that fat content some people worry about, says Pickett, too much of anything is bad. And that is why the avocado too must be only one of the many things you eat. Its health benefits also outweigh the perceived negatives.

5a0637349855b76bf13c44f4,Life in blockaded Qatar,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/life-in-blockaded-qatar/article19196802.ece,2017-07-02,,The Hindu,"Every day when Sheikh Abubakkar calls home in southern India, he tries to reassure his worried mother that his work is going on as usual in the United Arab Emirates. Mr. Abubakkar, 26, moved to Dubai in 2015 to work as a customer care agent for a courier service. In February this year, his company transferred him to Doha, the capital of Qatar.Mr. Abubakkar returned to Dubai in June to process his residence visa for Qatar and was getting ready to fly back to Doha when Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and a few other Arab countries cut diplomatic ties as well as land, sea and air links with Qatar. Many of my colleagues are also stuck in a similar position as no visas to Qatar are being processed here, but thankfully, my work has not been affected, said Mr. Abubakkar.Nearly 6,50,000 Indians are working in Qatar, which has a population of roughly 2.7 million. Only 12% of its population are native Qataris, while Indians constitute the largest group living in this tiny gas-rich nation. If one goes by sheer numbers, Indians will be the hardest hit by this diplomatic stand-off.Rising pricesInternational human rights groups have expressed concern over the impact of Qatars blockade on its migrant worker population. Adam Coogle is a West Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch and was recently in Doha assessing the impact of the diplomatic crisis on its migrant workers. He explained that none of the workers he interviewed were worried about the general situation but they have complained about the increase in food prices.The prices of basic items like tomatoes, potatoes and onions have gone up, Mr. Coogle told this writer. A labourer who was spending nearly 200-250 Qatari riyals on food every month has to now spend between 300-350 riyals, a significant rise for people whose monthly income is about 900 riyals. Contrary to the initial reports of food shortages, Qatar has filled the void by flying in supplies, mostly from Turkey, Iran and India. Food is readily available but the local options of fruit and vegetables from the neighbouring Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan and Lebanon have been replaced with the pricier versions from Holland, Australia, Thailand and Malaysia.In supermarkets, it is like a flash sale where the fruit and vegetables are gone even before they are put on the rack, said one local resident. I found only the expensive tomatoes from Holland at my grocery store and something basic like coriander leaves are missing from the market or cost 7 riyals a bunch. Most labour accommodations are scattered far away from the city and many workers depend on smaller grocery stores for basic needs. Such stores, they say, are taking advantage of the crisis and increasing prices. In order to crack down on such practices, Qatars Ministry of Economy and Commerce is encouraging residents to report businesses that are over-pricing supplies via social media.The ramifications of the embargo may sweep into other industries such as construction, as the country prepares to host the FIFA World Cup 2022. A lot of the construction material was brought in through these borders and due to the current crisis, it may create a lag with the ongoing construction projects, which will no doubt affect the workers, said Vani Saraswathi, associate editor at Migrant-Rights.org, an advocacy organisation that aims to advance the rights of migrant workers in West Asia. A delay in materials means there is delay in work, and we have seen subcontractors especially dont have the financial wherewithal to bide over such contingencies. This could mean workers being left unpaid, or not paid in time.Indians, who make up the largest expatriate group living in Qatar, will be the hardest hit by the diplomatic stand-off between the country and its Arab neighbours"
