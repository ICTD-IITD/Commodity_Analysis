A shortage of cash because of demonetisation. Despite Rs 3.5 lakh crore  enough to build 545 Tehri-sized dams  invested over six decades to 2011, more than half of all farms depend on rains. These are the three factors agitating Indians who depend on farming  90 million families, or 54.6% of Indias 1.2 billion people.As anger sweeps rural Madhya Pradesh after the death of six farmers in police firing, farm protests roil rural Maharashtra -- wholesale markets are shut, produce is being dumped on streets -- and governments of the debt-ridden states struggle to respond to demands for loan waivers, an IndiaSpend analysis and reportage from rural Maharashtra explores why farmers are both angry and desperate.The primary reason farming is unviable in India is that farms are now among the worlds smallest (the global average land-holding size is 5.5 hectares)  too many people are dependent on shrinking farms.Since 1951, the per capita availability of land has declined by 70%, from 0.5 hectares to 0.15 hectares in 2011, and is likely to decline further, according to ministry of agriculture data.Such small and marginal land-holdings, as they are called, now constitute 85% of the number of operational farms in the country, according this 2015-16 report on the state of Indian agriculture.It is hard to use modern machinery on small farms, the owners of which are often too poor to afford farm equipment. Manual labour increases costs, but labour too has been in short supply, as workers migrate to cities. Further, their size and output limits access to loans and institutional credit.Those are the larger issues. Here are the three reasons for the current turmoil, gleaned by IndiaSpends analysts and reporters:1. After back-to-back droughts, a good harvest, but incomes fallAs 2017 rolled in, the news from Indias farms appeared good.After droughts in 2014 and 2015, a good monsoon in 2016 reversed two years of rural economic decline. Indias agricultural growth contracted 0.2% in 2014-15 and grew no more than 1.2% in 2015-16, because of the back-to-back droughts. In 2016-17, the agricultural economy grew 4.1%.Across many states growing pulses, such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Gujarat, markets were flooded with produce, especially tur (pigeon pea), which witnessed the highest growth among all pulses, an important source of protein for a majority of Indians. India is the worlds largest pulses producer.However, an influx of pulses from Myanmar, Tanzania, Mozambique and Malawigrowing 20% over two financial quarters, from September 2016 to March 2017, the Business Standard reported on March 3, 2017caused the price of Indian tur to plunge.From Rs 11,000 per quintal (from December 2015), the price of tur fell 63% to Rs 3,800-4,000 per quintal  20% below the minimum support price (MSP)the price at which government buys farm produceof Rs 5,050 per quintal (including a bonus of Rs 425) since December 2016 as Indiaspend reported on April 12, 2017.The table above explains how production of pulses rose 29%, from 17.15 million tonnes in 2014-15 to 22.14 million tonnes in 2016-17. Tur production increased 50%, from 2.81 million tonnes to 4.23 million tonnes, over the same period.The MSP for tur should be increased to Rs 6,000 per quintal in 2017 and Rs 7,000 per quintal in 2018, a government committee headed by chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian recommended in September 2016.As on March 2017, the minimum support price for tur was Rs 5,050 per quintal, nearly 20% (18%) lower than the prices recommended by the committee on pulses.As these prices crashed, farmers found it harder to find money to store their produce and prepare for the next season because demonetisationthe withdrawal of 86% of Indias currency, by value, on November 2016 left them starved of cash.2. How demonetisation  and government red tape  left farmers short of cashOn May 18, at around noon, 30-year-old Prashant Lande waited under a harsh summer sun to sell 800 quintals of tur at the Amravati agricultural produce market committee (APMC), 664 km east of Indias financial capital, Mumbai.From Kinhala village in Amravati districts Ashti taluka, in Maharashtras eastern region of Vidharbha, Lande said he refuses to sell his 800 quintals of tur to the government procurement centre, although the state buys tur at a higher rate.At the market, Lande could sell his tur at Rs 3,800 to Rs 4,000 per quintal, while the government buying centre offered Rs 5,050 per quintal.We dont sell to the government centre because the process of selling takes one month  from standing in line for the token to the sale to finally when the payment reaches the account, said Lande. Our fellow farmers who have sold their produce at the procurement centre on March 22, are yet to receive their payments and it is nearly June!It does not help that the effects of demonetisation continue to to be felt across the rural economy.Right after demonetisation, tomato farmers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, and onion farmers in Maharashtra and Gujarat, were the worst hit as prices fell by 60-85%, IndiaSpend reported on January 18, 2017.With little respite more than six months later, the experiment has aggravated the circumstances leading to the current farmers strike.By now we should have begun preparing our fields for the monsoons, but because of demonetisation and the unavailability of cash, we are still struggling to find money for sowing, said Lande.At such a time, farmers like Lande turn to credit.Up to 57% of farm families in Maharashtra are indebted; the figure for India is 52%, according to the National Sample Survey Organisations 2013 situation assessment survey of farm households, the latest available data.This indebtedness has widespread consequences. More farmers committed suicide in Maharashtra (4,291) in 2015 than any other state, rising 7% from 4,004 in 2014, followed by Karnataka (1,569) and Telangana (1,400), as IndiaSpend previously reported in January 2017.Now, after Uttar Pradeshs new government waived Rs 30,792 crore of farm loans, pressure is building on the governments of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to do the same. Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has been reluctant to do so, but with his governments coalition partner, the Shiv Sena, and other parties preparing for a political agitation, he may find it hard to exercise fiscal prudence.3. In an era of climate change, 52% of Indian farmers without irrigationThe basic problem across most of rural India is that despite the spread of irrigationa sector plagued by unfinished projects and corruption52% of Indias farms still depend on the vagaries of rain, which is becoming increasingly uncertain in an era of climate change.Extreme rainfall events in central India, the core of the monsoon system, are increasing and moderate rainfall is decreasing  as a part of complex changes in local and world weather  according to a clutch of Indian and global studies, as IndiaSpend reported on April 15, 2015.The droughts of 2014 and 2015 in rural Maharashtra were mitigated by the plentiful rains of 2016, but many parts of the state also endured floods. Uncertain weather affects the ability of government extension systems to provide accurate advice to farmers.The government encouraged us to grow more tur in the kharif (July to October) season, since these crops consume less water and are in high demand, said Lande, the Vidarbha farmer. We would not have faced so much loss over the last three years, had there been a proper system of canals.Despite six decades of irrigation, less than 50% (or 66 million hectares of Indias net-cultivated area of 140 million hectares) as irrigated, according to the 2015-16 State of Agriculture report. Groundwater provides water for two-thirds of Indias irrigated land, but those levels are falling from overuse.From the first five year plan (1951-56) to the eleventh (2006 to 2011), the central government has spent a total of Rs 3.51 lakh crore, as we said, on major irrigation and flood control projects characterised by time and cost overruns, shows this 12th Five Year Plan (2012-2017) report.On July 1, 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY)or the Prime Ministers Farmers Irrigation Programmewith a budget of Rs. 50,000 crores over five years (2015-16 to 2019). The motto of the PMKSY is Har Khet Ko Pani (water to every field) and More crop per drop.In 2015-16, less than a third (Rs 312 crore) of Rs 1,000 crores set aside for micro-irrigation was released, reveals this government report. Of this, upto April 2016, no more than Rs 48.3 crore, or less than 5%, was actually spent, according this micro-irrigation financial progress monitoring report. The government set Rs 1,763 as the 2016-17 micro-irrigation target, but no data on results have been released.The micro-irrigation programme covers an area of 6,51,220 hectares, or 0.46% of net cultivated area.(Salve is an analyst with IndiaSpend.

Many a restaurant has been lost to the siren call of this beautiful bungalow at the start of Worli Koliwada.Its a beautiful space. A long corridor leads to a bar, the third of four parallel, pale-olive-green rooms, each with a distinct character. The bar is buzzy, the attached lounge sedate and intimate. The outer eating area has the relaxed air of a drawing room; the inner ones dominant long table is reminiscent of a dining room.Slink and Bardot describes itself as a French-themed restaurant serving modern-day Parisian cuisine. The menu embraces international dishes, ingredients and flavours as enthusiastically as classic and contemporary French cuisine. Its not too different from modern Indian, an equally rootless cuisine that draws on, and sometimes combines, local and global tastes.The eating areas at Worlis Slink & Bardot are intimate, relaxed and a nice contrast to the buzzing bar section. (Aalok Soni / HT Photo)At Slink and Bardot the cheese plate contains British, Spanish and Swiss cheeses, and a French one produced in India. The charcuterie platter is made up entirely of Italian meats. Along with a Salade Parisienne, is an American Caesar, Spanish gazpacho and Nordic gravlax - all made with Indian ingredients.They only serve small plates. Our cocktail arrives first; the gin-based Sitting in an English Garden Waiting for the Sun, served in a long-stemmed martini glass, is the equivalent of a slinky dress, but the cucumber juice drowns out the other flavours.A standout dish at Slink & Bardot is the tomato and mozzarella tart. Sweet, skinned tomatoes and gooey mozzarella come stacked on a thin, crushed-Parmesan, biscuit-like base. (Aalok Soni / HT Photos)The food seesaws between mundane and extraordinary. The panko-crusted popcorn chicken, essentially glorified McNuggets, are too salty, and the three dipping sauces are an indistinguishable blur of textures.

Being a homebound person by nature, I spent a lot of time in the kitchen helping my mother. Our food needs a lot of whisking, and she would ask me to stir the curries. She taught me how to make kibbeh, a mixture of finely ground lamb or beef, bulgur, onion, mint and Middle Eastern spices, which we would stuff in fish or lamb and fry, says Alshamali. The 35-year-old chef in the midst of launching a modern Middle Eastern cuisine eatery at the Renaissance Downtown Hotel, Dubai is in Mumbai to helm the ongoing Arabesque food festival at the J.W. Marriott Juhu.When we meet Alshamali, the Lotus Caf is pleasantly enveloped with the pleasing fragrance of zaatar and cinnamon. Middle Eastern food is similar to Indian food as most of the ingredients are similar, shares the chef. The food that Alshamali is dishing up for Arabesque is more home-style making it an authentic Arabic experience on a platter.On the menu is an authentic shawarma station. Alshamali is serving shawarmas with a special red chilli paste he has brought all the way from Syria. From the grill section, we try chicken in harissa sauce, prawns in a green souk sauce made from coriander and chillies. While the ingredients are easily identifiable, they create a completely unique zing on our palates. We quite enjoy the mild chicken cooked in yogurt with saffron.Past the grill section, which also has crunchy baby corns, green chillies and baby aubergines,we take a dollop of kabsa, rice with minced meat and meatball in tomato sauce made with pomegranate molasses, kokum and sumac, which gives the dish a berry-like sourness.The chef, whose earlier stint has been at Qbara, a modern Middle Eastern restaurant that made it to Worlds 50 Best Restaurants this year. He says, My first job in Dubai was in Atmosphere, the highest restaurant in the world housed in Burj Khalifa, where we served authentic French cuisine.He breaks down Arabic cuisine to the basics. Tahina is made from roasted sesame and harissa, a sauce made from Magrebi red chili, Moroccan spices and garlic, are the most commonly used. We also make a fine green zouk sauce which has coriander, green chillies, caraway seeds and lemon juice. We use pomegranate molasses and cumin too in our curries, he adds, sharing a childhood memory of his mother pickling vegetables for winter months. She would put the olives in brine solution for two months before we could eat it, he smiles.Our order of the shawarma is here, and we roll the pita bread that is stuffed with grilled chicken, the Syrian red chilli paste, lemon juice, onions. We dunk it in sour cream and the sweet and tangy red chilli paste pleasantly surprises us. While it is not at all spicy, it is supremely flavourful.Alshamalis version of a bakalava takes us into a food trance. Its freshly made and comes with a twist. It has no pistachio but a filling of walnut with cinnamon. It is flaky and soft and we are likely to crave this version more than the traditional pistachio one.The Arabic Food Festival, Arabesque at JW Marriott, Lotus Caf from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. daily till April 30"

But what has come as a reprieve was that the prices of essential veggies such as onion and tomato, had stayed below Rs 30 per kg.Summers usually see rise in vegetable prices due to water shortage and decreased arrivals of produce. Traders say that almost all supplies to Chennai are coming from other States and hence the transport cost adds to the vegetable prices. They say the prices have been on the rise for last one week.In the wholesale market at Koyambedu, onion, which was sold at Rs 12 per kg, is now sold at Rs 17. Tomato and potato, which were sold at 15 per kg, are now sold at Rs 25 and beans sold at Rs 60.Sales are dull. When the cost is high, people tend to buy less; they buy something like half kg instead of 1 or 2 kg. But, only when we increase the prices we get decent profit, says Badriswamy, vegetable vendor, Koyambedu.Traders say most of the vegetables and fruits are transported from neighbouring States such as Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. In such cases, the cost of production and transportation falls on the vendors and traders and as a result, price rise happens and burdens the buyers.This is the case every year. Vegetables and fruits are very essential. Demand will always exist, but sometimes it is not met with sufficient supply. Hence the price rise to which Ive clearly reconciled myself, says Rathna.In Aminjikarai market, prices are at peak. Brinjal is sold at Rs 80 per kg and tomato at Rs 30. A sack of onion, earlier sold at Rs 400, is now sold at Rs 800 and 1 kg onion is sold at 20 kg. Carrots and beans are sold at Rs 70 and Rs 80 per kg, respectively.I buy minimum of all vegetables as the prices are high. My budget for vegetables for a week is Rs 100, says Allabakash."

Photo for representational purposes.This is the time of the year when as temperatures rise with the summers onset, so do prices of most vegetables. Its a phenomenon as predictable as the fall in prices that accompany lower temperatures during the winter months.A good example is tomatoes, which are currently retailing at around Rs 16 per kg, as against an average range of Rs 8.5-12 during November-January. In all likelihood, prices will firm up further over the next couple of months. Last year, they averaged almost Rs 45 in May, over Rs 56 in June and eased somewhat to Rs 30 in July, before collapsing to below Rs 10 per kg in August (see chart).These wild price oscillations have largely to do with natural, occasionally untoward, factors determining availability. Tomatoes are usually a 120-125 day crop, which start yielding fruits after 75 days, with production happening in flushes. There can be up to ten flushes in any given crop cycle, each following the previous one in four-five days intervals. Although tomatoes can be grown year-round, the water stress during summers means plantings mostly happen in June-July (with the monsoon rains), October-November and January-February. Arrivals pick up from mid-August onwards and peak over the winter.The above irregular supplies are further exacerbated by tomatoes being perishable and not amenable to storage, unlike potatoes or onions. The result is that prices fluctuate hugely during any year, with consumers having to especially pay much more in May-June-July, when crop availability is very poor.When prices of any vegetable go up, there is a natural outcry from consumers. But whats often not realised is that an average household consumes a basket of fruits and vegetables (F&V). While prices of individual items may go up, what matters ultimately for the household is how much it pays for the entire basket during any given month.Thus, even though tomato prices go up with dwindling supplies in the summer months, this does not hold true for other vegetables such as bhindi (okra), kheera (cucumber), lauki (bottle gourd), tinda (round gourd), tori (sponge gourd) and chichinda (snake gourd). You get all these cheaper in summers because of increased availability, which is also the case with mangoes (the King of Fruits), watermelons, sweet lime (mosambi), lychees, plums, peaches and cherries.In the same chart displaying the swing in retail tomato prices since January 2016, we also have the average per kg rate for the entire monthly F&V basket consumed by households. This price  based on the average value of F&V purchased by our consumers at Bigbasket.com  turns out to be relatively uniform and stable. Our consumers paid between Rs 43 and Rs 60 per kg for the average F&V item, which is quite different from shelling out anywhere from Rs 8.5 to Rs 56 for a kg of tomatoes.If overall price stability is what counts, we shouldnt worry much if individual items within the entire F&V basket cost more during certain months. Moreover, prices become an issue only when they go up. Spare a thought for the poor farmer, including the one growing tomatoes. Last August, prices crashed to levels where production costs could not be recovered. In November and December also, a bumper crop, coupled with the sudden demand shrinkage due to demonetisation, led to farmers destroying their standing crop in the field. But that did not bother us much.Price stability is eventually not just about consumers. Its also about farmers. Without a mechanism to ensure enough remuneration for the farmer to feed and take care of his familys essential needs, he will be in no position to produce to meet our consumption requirements. The farmer should be entitled to a reasonable annual income increment, just as we look forward to during this time of the time. A four-five per cent yearly increase in our average F&V spend shouldnt be too much for us to bear.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express File Photo: Mayur Bargaje) Crates carrying tomatoes at the Nashik agriculture produce market committee. (Express File Photo: Mayur Bargaje)After a 10-day gap, auctions in 305 Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs) across Maharashtra finally resumed as farmers, who had been staging an agitation, decided to bring their produce to the markets. The core committee of agitating farmers, which met in Nashik on Thursday, had conditionally decided to resume agriculture supplies to the APMCs.The immediate impact was a sharp reduction in vegetable prices in the markets. At the Nashik APMC, a 20 kg crate of tomato that fetched Rs 200-250 10 days ago, before the strike started, was now selling at Rs 100-150. We are now afraid that the massive glut in the market, will lead to a massive fall in prices hitting farmers further, Neelesh Kor, a trader from Nashik APMC said.Many farmers had been expecting that due to the massive shortage over the past few days they would end up getting decent prices in the market. However, many of them returned disappointed. Before the strike, a bunch of 10 cauliflower heads would sell for Rs 100 to Rs 150 but on Friday, the price was between Rs 40 and Rs 50.We are scared of how long these prices will fall. We suffered over the past few days because we could not bring the produce to the market. Now we are suffering as the prices have fallen, Vishnu Sonawane, a farmer from Dindori, said. We have started the auction. Farmers suffered quite a bit during the strike as they would not bring the produce to the market. Over the past 10 days, traders were going to farms and picking up the produce. We hope that normalcy will get restored in the next few days, Jagdish Apsunde, a trader at the Nashik APMC, said.The core committee of farmers, while deciding to resume agriculture supplies to APMCs, had, however, laid down an ultimatum stating that if the state does not hold a meeting with the committee in the next two days they will hold sit downs before all government offices on June 12 and stage a rail and rasta roko across the state on June 13. The Committee has also stated that from Friday, it will not allow any minister in state government to hold any kind of function in the state.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

A sales ban has exacerbated losses, as the military fears profits are funding insurgent activities.In recent weeks, the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) donated 30 tonnes of early-maturing, pestresistant seeds to Borno's farmers.But IITA coordinator Kamai Nkike said three consecutive rainy seasons have been missed and the current season, which began two weeks ago, is also likely to pass without crops being planted.""Farming in northern Borno at the moment is practically impossible,"" said Nkike. ""The farmers want to be on their own.They are not happy with food aid."""

The delicate skin has fewer oil glands compared to other areas and is constantly exposed to the suns harsh rays and other chemical concoctions like harsh soaps and detergents. Plus, our hyaluronic acid decreases with age, leading to pigmentation, prominent veins and thin skin. This process starts in your mid-20s but becomes evident in the early 40s.Care for your hands as you do your faceExposure to water, cleansers, hand sanitisers, dry weather, long hours in air conditioned environments affect your hands. But with a little care, you can remedy the situation. Firstly, moisturise as much as possible. Whether you are sitting in your car or in your office, always keep lotion handy. As for the men, while strong hands might be appealing, callused ones certainly arent. So use a hand cream too but just dont borrow one from your partner. Sonia Sharma, Spa Manager at Taj Salon, Vivanta by Taj - President, Mumbai, advises purchasing formulas meant for men as their skin tends to be thicker. While doing the dishes, use gloves to avoid contact with harsh detergents. Swap harsh soaps for gentle hand washes with pH levels between 5.5 to 5.7.Dr. Neena Chopra, director, Beauty and Technical, Just Herbs (an e-store for organic and ayurvedic luxury skincare) has simple advice. She urges you to use the same anti-ageing products meant for your face, on the backs of your hands. Massage it in to improve circulation and then slip on thin gloves before bed. Also, a hand mask once a week delivers an intensive dose of hydration to your skin. Dr. Renita Rajan, a consultant cosmetic dermatologist, offers a quick home-care facial for the hands. Lather up a gentle cleanser and add some brown sugar to the mix. Use the concoction to gently scrub the skin until the sugar dissolves. It will exfoliate your skin without being unduly harsh.Of course, never forget sunscreen, even for your hands. Dr. Neeraj Tulara, specialist internal medicine at Dr. L H Hiranandani Hospital, Powai says, Just like the rest of your skin, your hands are vulnerable to damage from the sun, including dark spots that can make them look older. To protect them, Tulara says to regularly apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher reapply often. And if theyve gotten sunburnt, a paste of fresh tomato juice will reverse the damage.Pay attention to your potionsDr. Jamuna Pai, celebrity cosmetologist at Blush Clinic, Mumbai, advises being smart about your hand products. Whilst selecting your moisturiser, check the labels for key ingredients such as hyaluronic acid, niacinamide and dimethicone, besides urea, glycerine and shea butter as these will replenish the moisture that the environment takes out from your skin by pulling the water from the inner layers of your skin to the surface. Aloe vera, vitamin E oil, mango butters, also work well to soften and heal your hands. Dr.Chiranjiv Chhabra, director and consultant dermatologist at Skin Alive, recommends using a product with retinol at night since it has great anti-ageing benefits and stimulates collagen production.If you want to go beyond homecare, Dr. Apratim Goel, cosmetic dermatologist and laser surgeon, Cutis Skin Studio, Mumbai, suggests trying out the new Helios-II fractional laser, which works wonders on shrivelled hands and removes age spots and tanning. Filler injections containing hyaluronic acid like Juvederm, Restylane and Meso Infusion can also be given to moisturise the skin from within, she says.Give your hands, a handThe age-old offenders like smoking and drinking will sap your skin of any moisture. Load up on good ol H20 because dehydration can affect your hands badly. A good well-balanced diet rich in vegetables, zinc and fatty acids will contribute to soft skin. Dr. Maithili Kamat consultant dermatologist at Jaslok Hospital & Research Centre, tells her patients to keep a stress ball handy as squeezing it not only helps release tension but also helps build the muscles of your wrists and hands."

Source: Debabrata Mohanty House of Siba Bhatra, the farmer who committed suicide. Source: Debabrata MohantyON MARCH 3, a physically challenged tribal farmer, Siba Bhatra of Sanamasigaon village in Odishas Nabarangpur, had lunch at home just after noon and walked towards his paddy field about half a kilometre away. Sibas wife Sanadi was away attending the marriage function of her nephew in another village, while his father Banamali was at home.Around 3 pm, two neighbours saw Siba lying unconscious near a cashew tree next to his field with a 100-ml bottle of Lethal Super pesticide lying beside him. After undergoing treatment for four days, Siba, 47, a father of two sons and two daughters, died in the Nabarangpur district headquarter hospital on March 7.With Sibas wife and residents of the village claiming that he was stressed over his inability to provide for his family, the death has once again highlighted concerns over farmers suicides in one of Indias poorest districts.Watch What Else Is making NewsThe death comes more than a year after five farmers committed suicide within a span of 30 days between October and November 2015 in this southern Odisha district. And, it follows two more deaths of farmers in Odisha this month, including one in Chief Minister Naveen Patnaiks Ganjam district.On Saturday, T Bulu Reddy of Chikarada village in the Golanthara block of Ganjam consumed poison after untimely rains destroyed his tomato and chilli crops, said officials. Reddy, who had taken a loan of Rs 1 lakh for farming and Rs 1.5 lakh for the treatment of his ill son, consumed poison on the night of March 10, they said.Days earlier, another farmer Khainu Bagarti, 55, consumed poison in Kendapalli of Bargarh district in the west, after his crop of chilli, cauliflower and other vegetables failed due to lack of water, said his family. The government has directed the district collector to conduct a field investigation.Nabarangpur is the focus of an ongoing assignment by The Indian Express, titled District Zero, in a zone ranked at the bottom rung of the development ladder based on several indicators, such as literacy and healthcare.Nabarangpur tehsildar Akshay Khemundu acknowledged that Siba had taken loans worth over Rs 48,000 for his farming needs over the last four years, but cited an inquiry report prepared by local officials to argue that this may not have been the reason for the suspected suicide. And officials said that compared with 2015, when Nabarangpur suffered a drought, 2016 was a good year for farmers.He had taken a loan of Rs 35,000 in 2013 from the Sanamasigaon branch of Utkal Grameen Bank, of which he paid one instalment. Similarly, he took a loan of Rs 13,150 from LAMPCS (Large Scale Adivasi Multi-purpose Cooperative Societies) in 2014, but had not paid any instalment. He was never issued any notice either by the bank or the cooperative society, said Khemundu.There are also murmurs in Sanamasigaon about domestic discord in Sibas home, which Sanadi denied. He rarely spoke and never fought with me But he used to drink a lot, said Sanadi.Nilambar Satpathy, managing director, LAMPCS, Nabarangpur, said Siba had taken a loan of Rs 13,150 in July 2014 for farming, including Rs 4,650 for fertiliser, at an annual interest rate of two per cent. The same was to be repaid in one single instalment at the end of one year, failing which the interest rate would mount to 12 per cent. Bhatra had not paid any money till the end of July 2015, said Satpathy.The branch manager of the Utkal Grameen Bank did not respond to The Indian Expresss request for comment.Sanadi said she did not know the details of her husbands financial condition, except that he got Rs 3,600 as disability allowance every year. But it was difficult for the family to earn even Rs 100 a day, she said.Though struck with polio, which had affected both his legs since childhood, Siba used to till his share of land with the help of neighbours.Sanadi has an Antyodaya card through which the family gets 35 kg of rice at Re 1 a kg every month. But it was barely enough for the family. My husband and I used to work as agricultural labourers or household workers in others homes or fields, she said.Sanadi said poverty forced their two sons Gopal, 15, and Dhanurjay, 8, to drop out of school while one daughter Urmila works as a help in a schoolteachers home in Berhampur town. Kaushalya, the second daughter, is the only one in the Bhatra household still in school and now studies in Class VII.Officials said the government has given Rs 15,000 as ex-gratia assistance to the family from the Chief Ministers Relief Fund and District Red Cross fund. They also insisted that the death could not be attributed to crop failure, as there was no standing crop in his field.But Sibas death continues to haunt Sanamasigaon. No one saw him buy the pesticide. There is no pesticide shop in our village. He must have bought it from Nabarangpur town, said his neighbour Banamali Bhatra. As his wife was away, I served him lunch. He had his food quietly and left, said Sibas sister-in-law Kusuma Bhatra.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

I had cultivated tomato on a two-acre plot and invested Rs. 2 lakh. Now, at the time of harvest, the rates have crashed, said Nagarajappa, a farmer in Mallasandra, Kolar taluk. I am going to suffer a loss of a minimum of Rs. 1.5 lakh, he said.Currently, tomatoes are being cultivated on an estimated 9,850 acres of land across Kolar district.Most farmers are struggling to get the produce into the market, and they feel it is not worth the effort. We are not even able to cover the cost of labour and transportation, K.M. Nagaraj of Srinivasapur taluk said.Varying pricesThe lack of standardisation in prices is also cause for concern.For instance, a 15 kg box fetched only Rs. 25 at Srinivasapur APMC yard on Saturday, which is less than Rs. 2 per kg. However, at Kolar APMC, the rates were marginally better: a 15 kg box was going for anywhere between Rs. 50 and Rs. 60 (about Rs. 4 per kg) on Saturday.Only a month ago, tomatoes fetched on an average Rs. 150 to Rs. 200 for a 15 kg box, which is around Rs. 13 per kg. Farmers were relatively happy with this price.A farmer can reap profit only if they get at least Rs. 300 per 15 kg box. The government should come forward to provide relief to the farmers, said P.R. Suryanarayan, president, Karnataka Prantha Raitha Sangha district unit, Kolar.Price variations are forcing farmers to leave tomatoes to rot in the field. Dumping of tomato on the roadside has become a common scene in the district.However, while there is a glut in the market as more farmers have taken up tomato cultivation, the slump in demand in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu is being seen as the main reason for the crash in price. Farmers in these two States have cultivated tomato on a large scale resulting in lesser demand for Kolar tomatoes, claimed farmers."

(Express Photo by Abhinav Saha) Red Fort in New Delhi. (Express Photo by Abhinav Saha)A new study of global pollution shows that Indias air is the worst in the world (www.stateofglobalair. org/data). Masked Delhiites, caught in a relentless shroud of smog, have no choice but to inhale copious amounts of particulate matter. Somewhere, a quiet realisation has sunk in that the way we live is not safe. This awareness has led to a shift, with the thinking urban citizen attempting to make substantial changes to his own environment.Since 2015, we have planned over 250 balconies, terraces and small garden patches in the NCR, says Kapil Mandavewala, 36, proprietor of Edible Routes, a specialised garden solution company. They offer quite a range  from vegetables to oxygen-generating plants, and creepers. Based on a large patch of land in Ghitorni, originally an artists collective where Vivan Sundaram has his studio and Bharti Kher is a co-owner, a walk through the garden is full of revelations on design and natural ecosystems: cabbages and broccoli grow together in chaos while tomatoes are surrounded by fragrant basil.This is called companion gardening. The basil repels insects naturally and increases the tomato yield, explains Mandavewala. While his clients in highrises prefer to grow herbs, he has encouraged some of them to try growing patches of cabbage, onion and garlic as well. There are interesting looking flower pots that one is unlikely to spot elsewhere, with white pipes embedded in the mud. Mandavewala explains that the biggest quandary of the apartment dweller, who works and travels, is not being around enough to water the plants.Once you top these pipes with water, the pot can go for a month without watering as the moisture releases into the soil slowly, he says. Edible Routes has pots with a nutritive mix of mud and manure made with a machine bought from a design student in Ahmedabad.After returning with a science degree from the US in 2008, Mandavewala began tilling his familys 22-acre farm in Gujarat and supplying vegetables to a few families in Jamnagar. A chance invitation from an NGO, Manzil, for a workshop on urban gardening led him to set up shop in Delhi in 2014. He took a 14-day course on permaculture, a system of agricultural and social design principles implemented by learning from nature. Applying it to an urban context came with its own challenges: the way light falls in a highrise, in a vertical slant, may not be conducive to all vegetables and oxygen-generating plants.A special focus needs to be given to seepage and drainage of water. It took me a while to understand urban spaces and explain to the clients as well that every space is capable of cultivating something, says Mandavewala. For one home, he introduced Malabar spinach called poe saag as a vine, a popular variation of spinach down south but rarely grown in Delhi. In another, a family grew tori along their border walls.The clients, meanwhile, are mostly enchanted by their gardens. The joy of growing and cultivating your own food, knowing what youre consuming, is something else, says Mandavewala, adding that many of them begin with being terrified at the idea of taking care of several plants. One of the ironies of urban India is that farm land is acquired by people who dont know how to farm; the ones who know want a job in the city, in an office.A consultation with Edible Routes can cost anywhere between Rs 5,000 and Rs 1 lakh, depending on the material cost, area and charges for executing the project. They also hold gardening workshops every month for people who want to experiment themselves.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

VENKATACHALAPATHYC_VENKATACHALAPATHYBuying vegetables may no longer be easy on the pocket, at least for the next two months, say traders. The rates of many vegetables have skyrocketed over the last few weeks in town.According to traders, the prices of many vegetables steadily increased during April.While the prices of onion and tomato continue to be low comparatively, the cost of brinjal, beans and carrot have shot up. The rates have peaked as there is no yield resulting in poor supply to markets in Vellore, A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam.The cost of the local variety of brinjal, thorny ones, has been rising in the last one month, he said. It was priced Rs. 15 a kg earlier. The rates steadily increased during April and are now priced Rs. 80 a kg. The regular variety of brinjal costs Rs. 30 to Rs. 40 a kg.As for beans the price went up from Rs. 15-Rs. 20 two months ago to Rs. 80 now. The price of carrot rose from Rs. 10 to Rs. 50, Mr. Balu said.Ladys finger is selling at Rs. 15-Rs. 30. Beetroot too has become costlier  from Rs. 10Rs. 15 it has gone up to Rs. 40.Onion and tomato offer some solace to consumers. Onion sells at between Rs. five and Rs. 12 a kg, and tomato at Rs. 10.The rate of tomato continues to be low when compared to other vegetables, as there is yield during summer in parts of Andhra Pradesh, he added.Potato costs between Rs. 15 and Rs. 20; small onion between Rs. 30 and Rs. 40; drumstick Rs. 20; green chillies Rs. 20; snake gourd between Rs. 25 and Rs. 30; bitter gourd between Rs. 20 and Rs. 30; and ginger between Rs. 30 and Rs. 40.Cost cuttingMr. Balu said, Already, people have started cutting down the purchase of vegetables due to the spiralling cost.Those buying a kg earlier are now purchasing  of a kg.Those who buy four kinds of vegetables prefer to purchase just one or two varieties, he said."

An abundance of the produce has led to a crash in prices, dashing the hopes of farmers.While farmers in Kolar, Karnataka, dumped tomatoes on the road after the prices collapsed to a new low of Rs. 2 per kg last week from Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 a month ago, violent protests broke out in parts of Telangana after a good yield of the commodity in the two Telugu-speaking States brought down the prices from a high of Rs. 10,000 per quintal last year to a measly Rs. 2,500 this year.In Maharashtra, the demand for tur, which rode a wave of high prices last year, plummeted after its production went up from 4.44 lakh tonnes in 2015-16 to 20.35 lakh tonnes in 2016-17. So was the case of grapes after a crash in their prices plunged the vineyard owners across the State into despair.While most farmers complain about the poor remuneration for their produce in comparison to the prices that prevailed in the previous season, agricultural economists have traced the reasons for the glut and the resultant price crash to the cobweb phenomenon.After the prices of a particular agricultural commodity shoot through the roof during a season of scarcity, farmers resort to boosting the production on the premise of the pre-existing demand and prices, leading to a problem of plenty, reasoned Dr. R.S. Deshpande, former Director of the Institute of Social and Economic Change (ISEC), Bengaluru, explaining the cobweb phenomenon.Most of the agricultural products that have now suffered a price crash due to their abundance had yielded a rich dividend in the previous season.Chilli woesA long duration crop, consuming up to eight months for harvesting, red chilli cultivation was expanded in both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh this year after the commodity commanded a good price last year.However, in the absence of minimum support price for the crop, categorised as commercial, the market dynamics of demand-supply kept the price low from the beginning of arrivals in the market this season from April first week. As the top quality red chilli yielded a price of even Rs. 13,000 per quintal last year, the farming community had hopes of good returns this year too, a senior Telangana Agriculture Department official told The Hindu . But, it was not to be. The Centre has, however, announced a market intervention plan to procure 33,700 tonnes out of the 7 lakh tonnes produced in Telangana with a support price of Rs. 5,000 per quintal and assistance of another Rs. 1,250 per quintal for other expenses.The crash in the prices of grapes not only soured the expectations of the vineyard owners in Maharashtra, but also claimed the lives of at least two farmers.Few takers for grapesThe suicide of 36-year-old Manik Randive and 25-year-old Chetan Vasal, both from Nashik, has been attributed to the poor price their grapes fetched.Despite a robust grape production, there were few takers as the prices had collapsed. According to Shriram Gadhave, president, Vegetable Growers Association of India, wine manufacturers are contending their stocks are full. The average input cost per acre of grape was Rs. 3 lakh. Yet farmers were selling their produce at barely Rs. 2 lakh, he said.According to him, in April last year, more than 95% of the grape harvest was plucked by wholesalers and wine-makers from farmers gardens.Farmers even received a decent rate of Rs. 40-42 per kg. This year, barely 75% of the picking had been completed while the average rate was a paltry Rs. 8 a kg.Dent in tur pricesTur dal, which hit the headlines last year with its skyrocketing prices, has suffered a dent in its demand this year after large scale production. In Maharashtra, production of tur went up from 4.4 lakh tonnes last year to 20.35 lakh tonnes during 2016-17, bringing down the prices by a huge margin.The total purchase by the government through its agencies at a Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs. 5,050 per quintal was only around 4 lakh tonnes while another five lakh tonnes had been sold at rates lesser than the MSP through the Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMC). Several lakh tonnes remain unsold.But, even during the season of scarcity, rarely do farmers benefit. For instance, even though a consumer paid almost Rs. 220 for a kg of tur dal last year, the farm gate price was just Rs. 45 to Rs. 50, said Dr. Deshpande. Does it take Rs. 170 to convert whole tur to edible tur dal, he wondered.Echoing Dr. Deshpandes views on the cobweb phenomenon, Mr. Srinivas, a progressive farmer from T. Narsipura near Mysuru, said he gave up tomato cultivation this year as many farmers began growing the vegetable on a large scale in the region after it realised a good price.( With inputs f romLaiqh A Khan in Mysuru, B Chandrashekar in Hyderabad, Shoumojit Banerjee in Pune and Alok Deshpande in Mumbai )"

In spite of the bumper crop in the face of lingering drought conditions, the produce has no takers from the northern States, thanks to the boom of tomato farming in Rajasthan and parts of Madhya Pradesh, a sudden phenomenon this year.The Madanapalle tomato market, which caters to farmers in over 20,000 hectares in several villages, records 800 tonnes daily during summer, while nearly 70% of the fine varieties invariably reach Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, UP, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. Till last year, the first round of auction would be for the export qualities.Farmers of this region could hardly realise that their produce would become unwanted. For those who do not know things other than tomato-growing and selling and the ambiance of the local market yard, it was news that Rajasthan, the most arid zone in India, also could grow tomatoes, and the farming is slowly spreading downward into some parts of UP and MP.Latest on Thursday, the fine quality tomato was sold at Rs. 4 a kg  the lowest ever this season  as against Rs. 9 last year. Last week, the price stood at Rs. 8 a kg. Threat of further fall even to a rupee or even less looms. The farmers draw solace from the local market pundits who predict fall of arrivals from Rajasthan from the last week of May. They can resume their exports then.Agriculture Market Committee (Madanapalle) chairman Ratakonda Gurappa Naidu told The Hindu that tomato farming had picked up by leaps and bounds in Rajasthan in the last two years, and the stage had now reached a point of exports from there. Till last year, we used to supply tomatoes to northern States in hundreds of tonnes daily. Now, our advance is checked by the Rajasthans sudden boom. The farmers there halted our exports, and we are not going beyond Chhattisgarh, that too in urban areas. The exports fell from over 600 tonnes a day to a meagre 200 or even less now.Perishability factorHe said compared to the southern variety (of Madanapalle), the Rajasthans produce was fast perishable. The produce ready for harvest cannot last longer than three weeks, whereas the Madanapalle variety can sustain up to three months, he said.The market chief, who had studied the exports pattern for a decade, said tomato farming would fail to sustain heat beyond 38 degrees. This is why Madanapalle with its cool climate round the year became the evergreen tomato producing zone. This is for the first time in the local farming history that a northern State has started to threaten domestic farming here, Mr Gurappa Naidu said."

The tomatoes are usually marketed through the daily market functioning in Vazhappadi town.The wholesale traders from Salem, Namakkal, Villupuram and Cuddalore visit this market and procure tomatoes in the auction. There is a spurt in the production of tomatoes this season, leading to bulk arrival in the Vazhappadi market.Due to this, the price of tomatoes has nosedived for the past few days.The price of a box of tomatoes weighing 25 to 28 kg is priced at a paltry Rs. 100. The price is very much on the lower side, the farmers say adding that they will not be able to meet even the expenses involved in raising the crop.Andi, a farmer of Maniyarkundam village, said that farmers managed to raise the crop overcoming heavy odds due to the drought conditions. But the poor price was a matter of shock to them.The fall in the price of tomatoes was unprecedented and tribal farmers were suffering heavy financial loss, he said and demanded the State Government to take steps for providing adequate compensation to compensate the loss."

As food and drink establishments proliferate in certain locations, like Lower Parel and Bandra Kurla Complex, there are vast swathes of the city where residents live, but without the kind of dining or drinking options that locals crave.As Pooja Kanodia, who is the restaurateur with her husband, Pankaj, says with a laugh, My neighbourhood is very large, it stretches from Cuffe Parade all the way to Lower Parel. Canto, is a new all-day dining restaurant and bar at Opera House, occupying the spot that was formerly Karma. The Kanodias all-day restaurant and bar is targeting those people that dont want to drive to another part of the city for a night out, and is counting on the fact that there are enough people that would rather visit some place closer, that serves both quality food and drinks, and who want to visit often.Canto, lives up on both counts, with a menu that has been put-together by consultant chef Gracian DSouza, and a bar that features signature tipples by Mukesh Khatri of Bar Solutions. The interiors, by Shweta Kaushik, are transportive, allowing you to imagine a swish Milanese clubhouse, with velvet sofas, lots of green tones and arched windows that let you look out to the street. Says Kaushik of the interiors, They wanted a very vintage vibe, and no distressed finishings at all. A mirrored bar area, with black stone helps set off all the colour, and makes a mean spezie negroni, their twist on the classic cocktail, which comes with citrus infused gin, sweet masala vermouth and Campari bitters.A consideration made during the design process was the ample number of power outlets for those that want to work out of the restaurant, while sampling the eaterys all-day menu. Says Pooja, Weve tried to maintain a very warm and inviting feel. The worry, with an eatery that wants to be everythinga caf, bar, restaurant and hang outis that it ends up falling short on all counts. At Canto, that doesnt seem to be a problem, though its still early days when it comes to how customers see the all-day space, after all it opened in May 2.The food, is of the moment though, and Pooja describes it as being, global fusion. What that translates into on the menu is dishes like the ragda bao and sambar risotto. During the course of our interview though, we sampled less fusion fare, including a highly recommended lamb meatballs, which thankfully, had more of the promised tomato and less of the coconut flavour in its sauce. Also on the menu are au current favourites like the cheesy eggs Kejriwal.Even though a majority of the restaurants in the area are all vegetarian, serving up comfort food, at Canto the menu includes non-vegetarian fare, as the Kanodias wanted the eatery to be inclusive and welcoming to all.Canto, Opera House, Charni Road; 30151537; 12 noon to 1.30 a.m."
