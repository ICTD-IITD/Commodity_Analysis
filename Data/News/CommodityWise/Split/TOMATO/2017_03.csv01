While farmers were forced to sell tomato at less than Rs 5 per kg, consumers are compelled to buy it at Rs 100 per kg.Price distortions of farm commodities are a continuing phenomenon, as farmers lack control over pricing their own produce. More shocking is the fact that at the receiving end are 30% of rural households who cultivate 82% of arable land in the country.With most landholdings being less than one hectare, the capacity of small holders to bear loss on their produce is anything but suicidal. One farmer suicide every 40 minutes in the country reflects a systemic failure.The crisis amplifies when a previous year high price for a particular crop entices farmers to expand cultivation of the said crop in the following year. Farmers in Andhra Pradesh were shocked when tomatoes fetched Rs 551 per quintal in June this year compared to Rs 3,015 per quintal during the same month last year.Neither was there a drop in consumption of tomatoes nor was there an unexpected glut in the market. And, yet price plummeted like never before. Despite fertilisers and power subsidies, cost of cultivation has been on the increase each year. With farmers not making profit on their small produce (on an average farmers keep 25% produce for home consumption), about 52% of agricultural households are in debt.Average household debt is Rs 47,000. This is unlikely to change as annual income of median farmers is merely Rs 20,000 or just Rs 1,666 per month as per Economic Survey of 2016. That the middlemen and traders are milking large share of the profit is no breaking news. Shocking is the fact that in addition to farmers and consumers bearing the brunt, the state too is at the receiving end of price distortions.Having purchased 8.76 lakh tonnes of onion at a support price of Rs 8 per kg during last five weeks, the Madhya Pradesh State Cooperative Marketing Federation is now forced to sell the same at Rs 2 per kg via the public distribution system.Price distortions have caught the government by surprise too. To avoid onion stocks from rotting over, the Madhya Pradesh State Civil Supplies Corporation could fetch only Rs 2-3 per kg in the open market.One reason for the glut in onion had to do with the Federation purchasing it at a high price which encouraged the farmers from Maharashtra and Gujarat to unload their produce in Madhya Pradesh. However, the cumulative loss to the exchequer in this transaction alone is worth Rs 900 crore.What is true for tomato and onion is equally true for other commodities including pulses. Having stocked two million tonnes of pulses during last two years, crash in market price of pulses has left the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (Nafed) high and dry.All this lends credence to the argument that farmers get no more than 25% of the price that consumers pay, and the minimum support price in the best of circumstances benefits only 6% farmers.Under such conditions, does the governments stated objective of doubling farmers income by 2022 hold any ground? Far from taking the price distortion issue head on, the Niti Aayog instead contends that without additional income from non-farm sources, farmers will not be able to cross income of Rs 18,000 per month even after the doubling efforts.The condition demands a mix of soft and hard options to pull farmers out from the current distress. The soft options include liberalisation of contract farming, direct purchase by processors and bulk buyers, direct sale by farmers to end users etc.The hard options include shifting of the workforce to non-agricultural occupations, an inclusion of supplementary sources of income, modernisation of farming and marketing practices, reforms in land lease and better price realisation.It is clear that none of the options proposed by the Niti Aayog can rid agriculture from prevailing price distortions. If farmers are not assured of remunerative prices for their produce, their interest in farming will wane further.Allow exportsA recent World Bank supported study on Price Distortions in Indian Agriculture by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) suggests a ban on export bans on agriculture commodities to help farmers.The report draws reference to lost opportunity on account of export restrictions on wheat during 2007-2011 subsequent to the lifting of the trade ban wheat exports had touched a high of $5 billion in 2012.The question that begs an answer is whether or not exports directly benefit farmers? Exports do contribute to overall agriculture economics, but do not constitute direct benefit to farmers who are often at the mercy of the unending chain of middlemen.Since farmers income is unlikely to be doubled under the business-as-usual scenario, farmers would need direct cash incentives, in addition to input subsidies, to stay in the business of farming.Improving input efficiency (fertiliser and water) will help farmers make choice of crops to be grown. Crop advisories based on price trends of last few years, transit storage facilities at cluster level, and promotion of cooperative farming can enhance bargaining power of farmers.(Sharma writes on development issues)"

Futuristic looking docking stations, suspended bubble lamps and a wall fronted by space pods with messages flashing on them.It is 2 pm in the afternoon and my younger son, The Foodie and me, have strolled over to New Yorks latest attraction, Eatsa. The eatery has garnered a lot of buzz since it opened for the novel way in which it caters to its patrons. A customer can wander in, browse through the menu, order food, pay and pick up lunch, all without talking to a single human being.Inside Eatsa, a line of gleaming wooden daises with mounted iPads sit like sentinels on duty. We swipe a credit card and the app welcomes Sunita to Eatsa.The menu is divided into Bowls and Bites. But unlike a Starbucks or any of the myriad counter service chains, where there are so many choices and a line of impatient patrons makes you flub your order, here the robot is benign and encourages browsing through the menu.There is a bunch of lunch bowls to select from: Bento Bowl, Burrito Bowl, Smokehouse Salad, No Worry Curry, among others. As always these days in US, displayed prominently above the ingredients for the bowls is information regarding protein, calories, gluten or not, contains dairy or whatnot.I am tempted by many of the bowls: should I get the Toscana bowl? Or should I be adventurous and go for the Cantina Kale salad with jicama, crispy tortilla strips, roasted jalapeno ranch dressing, cilantro, lemon-herb toasted quinoa, green pico de gallo, avocado, green onion, cotija cheese, chipotle black beans, pickled onions, tender kale, and roasted red peppers. Each salad looks tempting and the images inviting.I decide to strike it easy and go for the No Worry Curry: stir fried quinoa with egg, arugula, roasted potatoes, spaghetti squash, pickled onions, red Thai curry, apple-cabbage slaw, curried wonton strips. A preview of the bowl looks delicious and the fact that it has only 660 calories and 17 g of proteins makes me feel thin already.The Foodie decides to challenge the Eatsa android by customizing his own hummus and falafel bowl, removing arugula and tomato cucumber from his bowl of pita chips, tahini dressing, feta cheese, tzatziki, warm lemon-herb toasted quinoa, falafel, kalamata olives, hummus, and harissa. He also orders berry chia parfait from the Bites section and a cold glass of sparkling cucumber melon water.After placing our orders and being thanked politely by the Eatsa cyborg, we scurry over to the next station where the orders are to be fulfilled. This is the best part of Eatsa: a bank of delivery cubbies, with transparent LCD screen as covers.As we wait, with the luminous light of the cubbies throwing a blue sheen on us, I look around. There is a Japanese tourist clicking away with his ubiquitous camera. There is a middle-aged couple looking a bit intimidated at the array of technology. Furtive whispering in a corner and they go out, looking for a restaurant with a human waiter!The order gets fulfilled quickly, not even taking 5 minutes. My name flashes on the screen, with a number next to it, indicating the cubby where my order is to be delivered. The Foodie and I open the screen, take out our order and leave. The entire transaction has taken less than 10 minutes.When we reach home and open our salad bowls, we are pleasantly surprised. The food is fresh, tastefully arranged and just enough for a lunch appetite. The savory flavor of the Thai curry and the red onions, the heartiness of the quinoa, the crunch of the slaw and the wonton strips, all creates a perfect food storm. If anything, the only thing here I would change is the degree of spiciness. For a salad, the chilly content is a bit on the higher side!Eatsas robotic system may sound gimmicky to some dyed-in-the-wool New Yorkers, but we absolutely love it. The second time we walk through its portals, the food android greets me, Welcome back, Sunita. And I almost reach out my hand to pat an old friend on the back!"
5a0115c99855b76bf13a6bfd,Farmers slam decision to withdraw strike,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/maharashtra-farmers-slam-decision-to-withdraw-strike-4687810/,2017-06-03,"At the APMC market in Kalyan on Saturday. Deepak Joshi At the APMC market in Kalyan on Saturday. Deepak JoshiThere has been a split in the ranks of farmers over the decision to withdraw their agitation after a meeting with Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis late on Friday night.A large chunk of farmers criticised the delegation which met the CM and claimed that the strike will continue. The backlash against leaders who were part of the delegation which announced the withdrawal of the strike has been so strong that many of them were forced to make a clarification that the strike has not been called off yet.If farmers think I have made a mistake, then I seek forgiveness from them. If they feel that the strike should continue then I am with them, said Jayaji Suryavanshi, member of the Kisan Kranti Morcha.Suryavanshi seemed to have drawn the maximum ire from farmers who burned his effigies. Visuals of the chief minister speaking into his ears during the marathon four-hour meeting on Friday created a perception that he had struck a deal with the government.This is a decision taken by children of farmers and not by politicians. We have told the state government that if it does not stay true to its promise in the next four months, we will not allow the government to function, Suryavanshi had said soon after the core committee meeting with the CM in which the withdrawal had been announced. However, the backlash the decision received seems to have made many leaders including Suryavanshi rethink their position.Many local farmers were unhappy that the committee decided to take a decision without taking into confidence farmers from across the state.The committee should have heard what the government had to say and then come back and shared the details with farmers. They, however, announced the withdrawal of the strike without any concrete assurances from the state or taking people into confidence. For us they are not a core committee but a chor (thieves) committee and we will continue with the agitation, Bhausaheb Shinde, a farmer from Puntamba in Ahmednagar district, which had become the epicentre of the agitation, said.The Maharashtra Kisan Sabha has also criticised the decision to end the strike.The CM has spun a web around farmers. He has not given any clear assurance. If others want, they can withdraw from the agitation but the Maharashtra Kisan Sabha will continue with its agitation till we receive loan waiver for farmers, said a leader of the Maharashtra Kisan Sabha.Ajit Navale, general secretary of the Kisan Sabha, said, The chief minister did not give a clear answer to any of our demands. The new October 31 deadline that has been declared is a farce the 4-person committee will only announce its findings that day. No concrete decision regarding the waiver of loans or implementation of the Swaminathan report has been taken.Fadnavis has said that the commission shall look into waiving of loans of farmers who have smaller lands. What about Vidarbha or Marathwada, where most farmers have 10 to 15 acres of land, said Navale.The Baliraja Shetkari Sanghatna also criticised the withdrawal and claimed that the government was attempting to create a rift between farmers.I was first invited to a meeting with the CM but was detained by the Pune rural police at Dehu Road police station. I was allowed to go only after the announcement of the strike being called off. This is an attempt to create a rift between farmers, Sanjay Patil Ghanekar, leader of the Baliraja Shetkari Sanghatna, said.Meanwhile, farmers in Nashik held a meeting on Saturday and decided to continue with their agitation including a state-wide bandh on June 5. The farmers meeting also heckled senior BJP leaders including Dindori MP Harishchandra Chavan and BJP MLAs from Nashik Balasaheb Sanap and Devyani Pharande when they tried to attend the meeting, forcing them to leave.In spite of the strike being called off, protests continued in areas like Dindori where women farmers blocked traffic on Kalwan Dindori road. In Saigaon near Yeola in Nashik district, onion and milk were thrown on the road. Similar agitations took place in Jalgaon and Parbhani as well.The decision to call off the strike seems to have had no impact on prices of vegetables which have kept on shooting up in cities like Mumbai. The wholesale price of capsicum jumped from Rs 60 on Friday to Rs 100 on Saturday. Carrot prices increased from Rs 40 to Rs 80, tomato from Rs 30 to Rs 80, brinjal Rs 40 to Rs 80. The price of a bundle of coriander jumped from Rs 100 to Rs 150.Vashi APMC saw nearly 175 vehicles coming into the market. However, the bulk of them were from outside the state.The prices are still high. The decision to take the strike back was taken only late on Friday. The market will remain shut on Sunday. We need to see how farmers react on Monday to the strike call that has been given. Only then will we get a clear picture on when prices can stabilise, Naresh Kor, a trader from Vashi APMC said.Lok Sabha MP Raju Shetti said the people who negotiated with the government were novices and he would hold a meeting of all farmer leaders and groups in Nashik next week to chart out the course of action. The Shiv Sena also criticised the state government and claimed that the state, rather than trying to find a solution, had tried to create a rift between farmers.Rather than trying to sort out the problem, the government seems to have tried to create a rift between farmers. They are just prolonging taking a decision. This is nothing but running away from the problem. It has been the Senas long-standing demand that there should be complete loan waiver for farmers, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo by Jasbir Malhi)TOMATO PRICES in the city have gone through the roof, with one kilogramme of it costing between Rs 75 and Rs 80 on Sunday. The tomatoes cost around Rs 20 to Rs 25 per kilogramme earlier.Tomato sellers assert that because of no supply from Nasik during this season and limited supply from Himachal Pradesh, the rates have skyrocketed. On Saturday, the price went even up to Rs 100. Chandigarh gets its supply of tomatoes from Nasik and Haldwani in normal season which is stopped during the rains.During monsoon, supply of tomatoes comes from Himachal. Now there is a lot of demand for tomatoes and the supply is falling short. Thats why the rates have gone so high, said Desraj, president of Small Vegetable Sellers Association. He added that the rates were expected to hover between Rs 65 and Rs 80 for two more months.Housewives complain that the price of tomatoes are costing more than a packet of paneer. A branded paneer pack of 200 gram costs Rs 60 and tomatoes are costing even more than that. I purchased tomatoes for Rs 100 yesterday from my local vegetable seller. When I asked, he said that he too was paying a hefty price for the tomatoes, said Rashmi, a resident of Sector 21.Many homemakers now prefer to use one tomato in a vegetable. I have told my maid to put only one tomato in any vegetable she cooks. Earlier, she would put at least three. The rates are so high these days that we cant afford to eat tomatoes, said Rajni Lata.Even the hoteliers are using less tomatoes in their vegetables. We have been told by our supervisor to use tomatoes less even in the vegetable curries because of high rates. But a vegetable doesnt taste good until we have tomatoes in it, said a chef working at a prominent hotel in the city.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"

The Indian Express had earlier highlighted how farmers sold potatoes at 20 paise per kg at the Pipli grain market in Kurukshetra district. The situation was almost the same elsewhere in the state, too, as there was no mechanism to support the farmers  who were forced to opt for distress sale  even after a bumper potato crop.Khattar claimed that the government has fulfilled almost all the promises made by the BJP ahead of the Assembly polls. Transparency in recruitment for government jobs has been stated as one of his top achievements. It was painful when the youths had to look for sifarish for government jobs. We have changed that pattern to ensure jobs on merit, he said.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo by Jasbir Malhi)In the past two weeks, prices of tomato, have soared from Rs 50 to 60 per kg to Rs 90-100 per kg in local vegetable markets. The wholesale rate, too, have gone up from Rs 40 per kg to Rs 55-60 per kg in one week. The prices is unlikely to change for at least two more weeks till the crop is not received from key tomato growing places including Nashik in Maharashtra.Though, every year during June to September, the rates of tomato goes up due to off season, but this year, the crop arrived quite late from Nashik due to heavy rains, which also damaged it to some extent. Due to the rise in prices, homemakers have been forced to cut its daily usage. Tomato is used in the preparation of almost every vegetable and pulses, but due to sky rocketing price we are trying to use it less as possible these days, said Sangeeta Sharma, a homemaker.We have been selling tomato between Rs 55 to 60 per kg in wholesale market and retailers are selling them at Rs 90 to 100 per kg for the past few days and it will continue the same for at least for 10 more days, said a wholesaler Prem Kumar in Jalandhars Maksundan vegetable market. Like Prem, another wholesaler said, We have been receiving very less supply of tomato from key growing states like Maharashtra, Karnataka and other southern states this year. Crops have been damaged in some areas due to heavy rain, which has affected the supply.Dimpy Sachdeva, president Arhtiya Assoication of Maksudan vegetable market, said that though high rate of tomato is a seasonal phenomena but this year the rates shot up much more high as compare to the rates which generally prevail in this off season. He said that they are yet to get the crop from Nashik which got delayed by two weeks due to heavy rains there.Retailers said that they have to bear the transportation charges to ferry tomatoes from mandies to local retail markets and their margins are not very high.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"

Onion was being sold for just Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh till the state government stepped in to buy, potato is still being sold for 80 paise in Haryana and pigeon pea (tur dal) is fetching no more than Rs 40 in Maharashtra.The glut and plunging prices is the sum total of the crisis staring at farmers across the length and breath of the country. Last week, matters came to a head after farmers protest in Mandsaur of Madhya Pradesh turned violent, resulting in six deaths.Like everywhere else, Mandsaur farmers were agitating after they were forced to sell onions at just Rs1 a kg. The prices are well below what they fetched in 2016: Onion for Rs 1 as against Rs 7, turmeric for Rs 50, half the price in 2016, soya bean at 33% lesser than the rate in 2016 and so on.Farmers blame their plight on demonetisation and the failure of the government to impose adequate import duty on time.Farm economy runs on cash and traders say they have no money to give us. We are forced to sell the produce at whatever price they (traders) are offering, said Jasbir Mamumajra, a sunflower grower from Yamunanagar in Haryana, who blamed demonetisation for his woes.Most of the agriculture trade used to run on cash, mostly unaccounted money, and on credit. With cash being sucked out, the traders have less liquid asset to take risks. In some places they are seeking a commission of up to 2% to make payment in cash.A farm trader in Indias food bowl of Punjab, Devinder Singh, agrees, saying note-bandhi has disturbed the trade cycle. Entire trade shifted to no-credit system. It has hit us hard, he said.An agriculture expert with Bihar government, Anil Kumar Jha, said input costs such as labour, fertilisers and pesticides have gone up significantly this year. This added to the miseries of farmers, already facing cash crisis due to demonetisation.Maharashtra farmers, who were first to protest after prices of pigeon pea (tur dal) fell, blamed the Centre for not imposing high import duty on pulses.The production cost of the tur per quintal is more than Rs5,000 for farmers. With the Union government allowing the import of lentil at Rs 3,700 a quintal, the farmers are not likely to recover their cost, said Vijay Jawandhia, farm activist and Shetkari Sangathana leader.Same was the complaint by farmers in Haryana, who have been forced to sell sunflower at Rs 2,500 per quintal as against the minimum support price of Rs 3,950 even though the cost of seeds have increased by almost 50% in 2016.We could have been saved had the government increased import duty on edible (palm) oil, said Balwinder Singh, a Karnal-based farmer. However, state government officials blamed poor quality for the low price.In Asias largest grain market in Khanna, Punjab, the prices of maize have plummeted with traders like Sanjeev Kumar saying the farmers are bearing the brunt. In Uttar Pradesh, farmers sold wheat at less than the minimum support price, saying government agencies were not willing to buy the produce because of the record production this year.Wholesale traders in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh said the prices of onion, tomato and potato have crashed.The per quintal wholesale prices of the onion in Maharashtra was down to Rs 600-800 from Rs 1,000-1,250 in 2016. Potato in Haryana was sold at Rs 80 a quintal on Tuesday. Farmers sold onion for Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh after which the government announced a procurement price of Rs 8 per kilogram.P Chengal Reddy, founder-chairman of the Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations (CIFA), said: The Centre takes into consideration the average production of past three years and not the current years production cost, in deciding the MSP. If it continues, time is not far when farmers across the country will revolt, he said.(With inputs from state bureaus)"

Why should we have to wait here in this long queue to get aid?We used to have a dream life and weve fallen all the way down to the bottom, said the 38-year-old mother of two, declining to give her full name for fear of reprisals against family members left behind in districts still under jihadist control.IS seized the northern city of Mosul in June 2014 and imposed a brutal form of Islamist rule and a regime of terror on its inhabitants.Life has been made even harder since the battle launched last October by Iraqi security forces to drive out IS. East Mosul and a large part of the west is now back in government hands.In their no-holds-barred defence, the jihadists have used civilians -- caught in the crossfire and already the victims of food, water and electricity shortages -- as human shields.I break the (dawn-to-dusk Ramadan) fast with whatever I can find. Sometimes we even find sand and worms in the water we have to drink, said Umm Mohammed.She was among the women, children and the elderly standing in line amidst the rubble of pulverised buildings and the carcasses of burnt-out cars, many of them protecting their heads from the blistering sun with towels or rags.- What sort of life is this? -Another mother, Umm Yussef, stood nearby in tears, having failed to add her name to the list compiled daily of those entitled to the aid packages of rice, lentils, milk, sugar, tomato juice and cheese.I have 10 children. We break the fast just with water from the well and tomato juice. What sort of life is this? she asked, her voice tinged with both sorrow and anger.Umm Yussef said she would celebrate the Eid feast that follows the Muslim holy month -- at the end of next week -- only once her daughter Leila and their family are freed from Daesh (IS) control.All they have to eat is grass and sand, she said as a passerby handed a biscuit to one of her children.Young volunteers last week handed out 2,000 modest aid packages to inhabitants of areas of west Mosul recaptured by Iraqi forces.We try to meet a modest part of the needs of needy families, said 21-year-old Mohammed Dilan, one of those distributing the aid raised from donations by businessmen and other individuals.For those displaced from Mosul and forced to take refuge in overcrowded camps outside the city, life can be even more treacherous.A mass food poisoning this week at one such camp, Hasansham, left hundreds requiring urgent treatment, officials said Tuesday.Health ministry spokesman Seif al-Badr said around 100 of those affected required serious treatment after the iftar meal which breaks the fast.More than 800,000 people have been forced to flee their homes since the battle for Mosul erupted."
