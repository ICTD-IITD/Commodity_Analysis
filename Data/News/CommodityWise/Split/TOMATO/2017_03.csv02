(PTI Photo, File) Nagpur: Farmers throwing vegetables on a road during a protest as part of the Maharashtra bandh over various demands in Nagpur, Maharashtra on Monday. (PTI Photo, File)A HUNDRED years after Mahatma Gandhi led a movement of indigo growers against their oppressor landlords in Bihars Champaran district, farmers of Maharashtra launched an unprecedented strike early this month. But unlike the Champaran Satyagraha, this was a movement led by farmers themselves. It started with farmers from Puntamba, a sleepy village in Ahmednagar district, deciding at a Gram Sabha meeting in April to stop supply of all produce to cities from June 1. That resolution was subsequently adopted by farmers in villages across Maharashtra, culminating in a stunningly successful strike lasting almost 11 days.The striking farmers not only shut down wholesale produce markets and blocked highways to prevent delivery trucks from reaching urban centres, but also even dumped milk and vegetables on the streets. The Maharashtra government was, then, forced to constitute a Cabinet subcommittee of five ministers to hold consultations on the main demands that included a complete waiver of institutional farm loans and remunerative crop prices based on theM S Swaminathan reports formula of 50 per cent returns over cost. These demands were accepted in principle, following which the strike was called off. The collective might of farmers had clearly triumphed over the all-powerful state.The Maharashtra farmers agitation was remarkable for not only its seeming spontaneity and absence of any towering leader, but also it happening in an above-normal rainfall and bumper agricultural harvest year. Such protests one would have normally expected in the event of losses from drought, especially of the kind seen in 2014-15 and 2015-16.But as the accompanying table shows, the Maharashtra government infused around Rs 20,939 crore during the two consecutive drought years through time-honoured relief measures such as crop loss compensation, insurance claims and labour payments under MGNREGA. In addition, rescheduling of crop loans and reduced interest on these  plus the state governments ambitious Jalyukta Shivar programme of water and soil conservation in 25,000 drought-prone villages  turned out to be significant interventions.The trigger for the current farmers agitation has not been any natural calamity-driven distress, which was, on the whole, deftly handled by the state government. Instead, it has primarily been prices.A bumper crop resulting from good rains had ignited hopes among farmers of setting-off their losses from previous years. But what they encountered was a price crash across crops  from cereals and pulses to vegetables and fruits.Take pulses, where the Centre, in a bid to promote their cultivation to bridge domestic shortages, raised the minimum support price for tur (pigeon-pea) from Rs 4,625 to Rs 5,050 per quintal. Farmers obliged by increasing production, but the government failed to honour its promise. Far from getting the promised rate, farmers had to dump tur for as low as Rs 3,000 per quintal. Even during peak summer, they realised hardly Rs 5 per kg for tomatoes, onions and other vegetables.In short, farmers suffered more with record production on the back of good rains than when there was crop failure from drought.A second trigger for the stir was the crop loan waiver announcement by a newly-elected government in Uttar Pradesh, which took place around the same time prices were crashing. Farmer organisations admit that waiving loans cannot be a real solution, but say that it will have a soothing effect in the present context. At the least, it will bring many farmers back into the formal credit system. Also, if there can be a farm loan waiver in UP, then why not in Maharashtra?What is clear from the above is that the risk of price fluctuation in agricultural commodities isnt covered by any of the existing government relief mechanisms. The need of the hour is a framework that insulates farmers from the shocks of not just natural calamities, but also market price crashes. And loan waiver cannot provide any sustainable solution.That said, the Maharashtra farmers agitation  and the state government having to eventually concede to an unconditional loan waiver  is a game-changer, simply for showing how even an otherwise unorganised class can successfully express and negotiate demands. Organised labour unions, not to speak of industry associations like FICCI and CII, are known for constantly engaging in promoting and protecting the interests of their members. Farmers have had no such arrangements for collective lobbying. In this case, though, ordinary farmers under the most lugubrious conditions stood firm on their demands, resisting attempts to divide and weaken their ranks.The following elements may have contributed to the invisible glue of emotional unity among Maharashtras farmers: * Insensitive statements against farmers by some responsible public figures even amidst tumbling crop prices. Similar statements from top bankers (and also the financial regulator) against loan waivers and the possible adverse impact on repayment culture would only have further fuelled resentment among farmers.* The photos/videos of farmers ploughing back their onion and tomato crops because of not being able to afford the additional cost of harvesting. These images went viral on social media and were exchanged by farmers with one another. n Drying up of credit post-demonetisation from cooperatives, the lifeline of farmers in Maharashtra. They were, then, compelled to approach commercial banks and moneylenders for credit on far less favourable terms.* A spike in suicides, including in northern Maharashtra, the countrys top onion and grape producer. The latter belt has been the epicentre of the strike. The losses to its farmers have been more, as they grow a host of cash crops entailing higher investment and also exhibiting greater sensitivity to price crashes. These farmers are generally more well-off, educated and combative. They, not surprisingly, provided the leadership for the movement.* A sustained public debate on farm debt waiver in the last two years, amidst talk of loan write-offs for big corporates. The Oppositions Sangharsh Yatra and also a ruling coalition partners Atmakalesh Yatra marches in support of loan waiver would only have created the perfect pitch for the farmers strike.These elements established a common chord of angst amongst lakhs of farmers, culminating in a state-wide agitation. This is a classic example of collective behaviour driven by group dynamics that leads people to engage in unthinkable acts under unusual circumstances, as was propounded by the American social scientist Robert E Park. And nobody could have imagined that the success of Maharashtras farmer strike would pave the way for similar demands elsewhere, including in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

A host of conditions have been stipulated pertaining to food, cleanliness at the kitchen, cooking, transportation, Manoj Rajan, Special Commissioner, BBMP, who is incharge of the Indira canteen project told DH.He said it has been stipulated that the caterer will have to abide by the provisions of the Food Safety and Food Standards Act, 2006. A third party audit will be conducted on a regular basis to monitor quality control and hygiene related issues, Rajan said.Precast technologyIn an innovative move, all Indira canteens are being constructed using 78 prefabricated elements. The government decided to choose precast technology over the conventional brick-and-mortar method as the former has the advantage of quality and speed of construction.It is estimated that precast technology helps in saving up to 64% of the time taken for projects using normal construction method. Each canteen will have eight tall round tables outside the premises and six benches inside. At any time, 80 people can partake food at the canteens, Rajan said. One centralised kitchen per Assembly constituency will cater to all wards in the jurisdiction.LogoThe state government has finalised the logo for Indira canteen after holding a competition in which 600 citizens participated.

The current prices of tomatoes have already soared to Rs 70-80 per kg in retail markets and would remain so for at least next two months.According to wholesalers, the prices have increased due to a heavy reduction in supply of tomatoes from neighbouring states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Haryana after the rain.Tomato prices shooting up is a normal occurrence during the monsoon months, from June to September. This is because the stock spoils easily during the rain. Right now, we are getting our supply only from Himachal Pradesh, said Rajendra Sharma, president of Azadpur Mandi.The shelf life of tomatoes is not more than four days. Not all retailers have an access to cold storage. So, they tend to recover the losses by selling at a higher price, Sharma said.According to wholesalers, the situation will remain the same until fresh stocks arrive in the markets by August-end.On Thursday, the wholesale prices of tomatoes at the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) market at Gazipur were between Rs 30 and 40.The soaring prices of vegetables have affected the sales of vendors in local markets.Till May-June, the retail price of tomatoes was Rs 40 per kg. As soon as the pre-monsoon showers hit the city, the prices climbed to Rs 60 per kg and finally soared to Rs 80 per kg by the end of the month. Due to a spike in prices, people do not buy more than half a kilogram of tomato at a time, said Abdullah, a vendor at Malviya Nagar vegetable market.Even coriander leaves and green chilies, which came complimentary with vegetables, are now being sold with a price tag of over Rs 10-15 for 100 grams. The increase in the vegetable prices has forced many to exclude these from their shopping list.Except for onions and potatoes, prices of all vegetables have increased by Rs 5-10 in the market. I used to buy vegetables for Rs 200 twice a week, but now the same quantity of vegetables cost anything between Rs 300 and Rs 350, said Aarti Malik, a resident of Geetanjali."

After remaining stable till a few weeks ago, tomato prices rapidly increased at Rs 50 per kg in the wholesale markets. Vendors purchase a 25-kg tomato case for Rs 600 and sell native tomatoes at Rs 40 per kg. Tomatoes of higher quality are sold at Rs 50 a kg.However, retailers who buy the same case at Rs 600, sell tomatoes at Rs 65 a kg at Anna Nagar and Kilpauk. The price is high for the past two days. It was at Rs 24 a kg and now it has reached Rs 56. I have cut down on the quantity, says V Nagalakshmi.Supply is less. As tomatoes come from Andhra and Karnataka, the climate there also matters to cultivate crops. Excess rain or heat, both can damage the growth of tomato plants, says Ambedkar V, a vendor.Wholesale markets at Porur and Kilpauk were closed on Friday and those that were open wore a deserted look. With tomato prices on the high, the wholesale price of onion seemed decent. It was sold at Rs 13 a kg in wholesale and Rs 20 a kg in retail.Some retail shops at Anna Nagar sold onion at Rs 80 a kg.Onions and potatoes are being sold at Rs 20 a kg. But Rs 80 is too expensive, says Arjun.V, a wholesaler."

Kitchens, including those in restaurants, will find the going tough if the agitation continues beyond the weekend.Not a single onion truck arrived in the Vashi market, indicating the strike's appeal in Nashik district which provides onions to the entire state and large parts of the country . While only eight to 10 items could reach the APMC against the regular 94 kitchen staples. Even the quantum of produce halved on Friday , compared to Thursday and Wednesday .Atotal of 43,827 quintals of fruits and vegetables arrived on Friday as against 70,246 quintals on Thursday and 78,272 quintals on Wednesday , shows data from the state's marketing department.Overnight, retail prices of vegetables and fruits doubled in certain localities, partly because wholesale rates rose and retailers chose to take advantage of the situation. Coriander was a stinging Rs 150-200 for a big bunch, prompting several vendors not to stock it.Andheri resident Shyam More said, ""There was no spike in vegetable prices which normally occurs between March to May . But this two-day strike has turned the situation upside down. The fear is milk supplies could be affected in the days to come, which will worsen our predicament."" The Andheri municipal market wore a forlorn look. Greengrocer Iqbal said, ""I sourced merely a few items like cauliflower, cabbage, spinach and green chillies for the day . I did not stock tomato or brinjal as wholesale prices were high and I would suffer losses if there are no customers."" By Friday evening, Iqbal sold cauliflower at his cost price of Rs 50, only to clear his stock.In Matunga, one of the most expensive markets in the city , seller Bhavesh Baarve chose to shut shop for a day . ""Vegetables in Vashi market were so expensive, I chose not to buy . I will assess the situation on Saturday ,"" he said. Adarsh Shetty , president of AHAR, an association of over 8,000 bars and restaurants in the city , said restaurant and bar owners had enough stocks to cater to customers till Sunday . ""If the agitation continues on Monday , the food business may be adversely affected,"" he added.Fruit sellers at Crawford Market were anxious about the strike continuing into the weekend. Trader Pradeep Phalke said, ""When vegetables have spiralled to Rs 80-120 per kg, few will buy fruits.""Aftab Ahmed Khan, chairman, Mumbai Egg Traders Association, said, ""Trucks of eggs and chicken, which come from Hyderabad, are held up at Umergaon on the border.

The imminent onset of rains will destroy harvested produce as well as standing crops in the fields.""Approximately 250 truckloads of vegetables unloaded in Vashi on Sunday which is almost the same number as Saturday. Of these just 50 trucks were from Maharashtra , the rest from Gujarat, AP and MP. But few buyers arrived because of the uncertainty of the situation,"" said APMC trader Shankar Pingle.Pingle said other states were reaping the benefits of a local agitation. Deepak Sathe, owner of Byculla and Vashi's Sai Vegetables said, ""On Sunday, the wholesale rate of tomato was Rs 40-45, cauliflower and ladies' fingers Rs 45, capsicum Rs 50, green chillies and coriander Rs 60. I also deal with tomato farmers in Pune and Narayangaon who say they are barely finding buyers even for Rs 17-18 per kg. But see the exorbitant price Mumbaikars are being forced to pay.""Retail prices did fall marginally in certain areas like Dadar, Vikhroli and Bhandup but this was not enough to entice customers back to the market.Retailers opted to stay away from Vashi on Sunday for two reasons. Matunga vendor Rajabhau Patil said, ""We had vegetables left over from the previous day and we knew that few customers would step out to buy Sunday. Also there was the match between India and Pakistan. We cannot replenish our carts in such expensive times unless we are sure we will find buyers.""Several families tend to dine out or cook non-vegetarian fare on Sunday. This is another factor that prompts vendors to keep from adding stocks over the weekend. The trading community unanimously believes that the state should solve the impasse by inviting all farmers' groups for talks rather than pick and choose factions. Patil as well as Shankar Pingle, who was director in the NCP-affiliated APMC, echoed similar sentiments."

Sandeep Gidde (34), an MBA, is a Sangli farmer who also works as an event manager hosting agri-exhibitions. And 47-year old Dhananjay Dhorde has a Bachelor's degree and owns a 15-acre farm in Aurangabad.Younger, educated farmers like them form the backbone of Kisan Kranti, the group spearheading the strike which has crippled vegetable and milk supply chains across large parts of the state. The apolitical, leaderless agitation has drawn support from 37 smaller groups. But its core members are between 30 and 50 years old. Few have participated in previous agitations even though they come from farming families.""Our fathers did `rasta-rokos' and hunger strikes but it led nowhere. So we decided to do something different. If you don't pinch the nose, the mouth won't open,"" says Rayate. Significantly , the Opposition's `Sangharsh Yatra' just two months ago created barely a ripple.Besides small meetings, the use of social media including Whatsaspp and Facebook helped the movement reach out to other groups, guided by Gidde's event management skills. ""I knew how to reach out to large groups of people effectively and what posts could go viral,"" he says.What drew the Kisan Kranti together was the devastating crash in prices of key crops like onions, tomatoes and tur dal over the last year. The issue touched a chord among farmers across districts.The price crash had pushed even prosperous farmers like Rayate deeper into debt. ""Grapes which cost Rs 25 per kilo to grow, fetch a price of Rs 10. Last month brinjals were selling at Rs 25 for 20 kg. It cost more to transport them to the mandi,"" he said.The final catalyst was a gram sabha meeting in Ahmednagar's Puntamba village in April where villagers initially considered boycotting sowing. Later they decided to boycott agricultural markets instead. ""They realized its only when urban food markets are affected that there will be pressure on the government,"" says G Patil, an agro-markets expert who is part of Kisan Kranti.The movement spread to the onion belt of Nashik and the milk producing regions of western Maharashtra including Sangli, Satara and Solapur. Marathwada's districts, mainly Aurangabad, also joined.The discontent among farmers in the north Maharashtra belt had escalated with the state's decontrol of agricultural markets last year, says Patil. ""Traders called a strike for a monthand-a-half and onion prices crashed to 5 paise,"" says Patil. Later, the glut in the onion, tomato and tur crop kept prices low. Farmers ended up dumping their tomato and onion crop. By November, demonetisation added to the crisis.Activists recall a similar agitation led by farmer leader Sharad Joshi in 1982 but this one has created greater impact. ""The idea spread so fast because its time has come,"" says Patil. ""The new generation of farmers are more aware.They understand issues like import subsidies and the fact that crops are sometimes imported at a higher price than domestic rates.""Kisan Kranti has also drawn professionals including lawyers and social workers, whom they rely on for advice.""We have drawn up committees for different tasks: legal advice, meetings with the government, administration and publicity ,"" says Gidde."

Earlier we used to get around 20 trucks filled with vegetables in Jambli market, but now only three to four trucks come.

In several parts of the state, protesting farmers destroyed stocks of vegetables and milk headed towards cities and clashed with police as the chief minister ruled out a blanket loan waiver.Wholesale prices of certain produce increased by Rs 5-10 on Thursday as only 430 trucks arrived in the Navi Mumbai APMC, compared to the usual 500.""Retail prices did not increase on the first day of the strike. But if the stir continues,and agitationists stop farmers who bring their trucks to Mumbai along the highway, they will have to take a detour via smaller internal roads.

""While 30-40% vegetable supplies for Mumbai come from other states, prices of items coming from outside Maharashtra remained constant. Supplies of capsicum and tomato were less than the daily requirement which pushed their prices up. Friday will be decisive,"" said Balasaheb Badade, a trader.On Thursday, hundreds of agitating farmers in western and north Maharashtra and Marathwada region poured milk and dumped vegetables on roads to denounce government's inaction. Meanwhile, the agitation's co-ordinating body said the strike will intensify after chief minister Devendra Fadnavis rejected two of their main demands in a press conference in Mumbai. The CM ruled out a blanket loan waiver and said the state government will have to study whether implementation of the Swaminathan committee report will benefit the state. The Swaminathan committee report suggested support pricing for all agricultural produce in the state. ""A complete loan waiver is not possible for the state. If we had to give a loan waiver to all farmers in the state we would require Rs 1 lakh crore which is not even the revenue of the state per year,"" said Fadnavis. The state's annual revenue is between Rs 85,000-90,000 crore.""There are 31 lakh farmers across the state, who are outside the banking credit system and we are working on a scheme to make them creditworthy again. That itself works out to Rs 30,500 crore. We will have to look into their pending loans for which a committee has been formed,"" said Fadnavis.He slammed farmers who stopped trucks on Thursday and threw the produce on the roads. ""How can these people, who are holding other farmers to ransom, call themselves farmers? A strike has to be voluntary. You can't force anyone to be a part of your group,"" said Fadnavis. The CM said the government has called people leading the protest for talks. He also warned milk co-operatives who are not accepting milk from farmers. ""We will dissolve their board and appoint a government administrator, if these instances continue,"" he said.Finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said in Pune, ""The scenes of farmers resorting to strike are as heartbreaking as mothers shunning their duties towards children. It is definitely not a matter of pride for us that farmers are taking to the streets.""Several instances of stone pelting, burning and damaging of vehicles were reported across the state and police fired in the air to disperse agitators. Curfew was imposed in Yeola, Nashik, where a farmer and a policeman were injured in clashes. Most APMCs in Nashik, Solapur, Ahmednagar and Pune were shut though there was negligible support for the strike in Vidarbha."
