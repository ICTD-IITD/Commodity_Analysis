5a04a53c9855b76bf13be519,As you sow…,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Masquerader/as-you-sow/,2017-06-11,"The inventory begins-in agriculture, as in life! Peeling-off the political peels, there lies a core to the matter, which serially has the following aspects.Is farming the riskiest profession in this country, leading to so many suicides? Is a farmers income stability the same or even comparable to that of the wholesaler, retailer or consumer? Why does he have to take a heap of loans, and still continue to top-up? Why does the hand that tills the soil still considered synonymous with poverty? Are MSPs (minimal support prices) calculated on say, 25% above the costs, as retail elsewhere is protected by MRPs? All politicians being farmers (80% truly, the remaining by possession of land), enjoy tax exemptions, and earn their salaries, seem to have the cake and take it too! Can they help filling the loan kitty by paying taxes on their huge farm incomes?Finally, like so many professions, why does the farmer prefer his sons to settle in jobs in cities to plough-in the same profession?Some answers are obvious. Others may be linked to the frailty of human nature. The glaring blunder that one sees is that quite like the Imperial policy. Independent India found it easier to continue to enforce a camouflaged negative input policy (lagaan) on the farmer (In WTO parlance, it was once remarked that Indian agriculture was working on a negative subsidy). After consuming his voting powers, he was to be kept ignorant and disconnected so as not to be able to negotiate his grains in his market-linked product.Misinformation was to make him kneel down before his self -chosen ministers and beg for financial assistance so that he could he could replace himself as the second bull to till the soil once again.He was unaware of one crucial rightthat since he was the owner of the product, he had a right to negotiate for prices with his government, and that would also include international markets. I am not ruling out the democratic process of negotiations. No system was worked out. Our tanned sinewy brothers began to be seen hanging from trees, or slain by pesticides bought from loans, which was actually their own money, perpetually and systematically picked from his pockets. Cant blame anyone in particular, for we have had two farmer Prime Ministers (Ch. Charan Singh, Shri Dewe Gowda). I may vindicate the premise further. Why is loan waiver to the farmer a winning proposition for any political party, and has been tried by every political party!The book of politics is the same. Only editions vary.I had the honour of treating Indias first agronomist, Shri Sharad Joshi, the founder of the Shetkaari Sangathana in Vidarbha.Being a Rajya Sabha member, and for a while a WTO negotiator at that time, he would drop in casually, and often invite me to dinner at the India International Centre.On a particular day, he asked me how much a movie ticket cost twenty years ago. It was reasonable to guess, Rs. 20-25.At the time of the conversation, a PVR ticket was around Rs 500. Regarding onion, and tomato prices, I agreed they must have been around 10-15 then, and 15-25 now.He brought out his point that though the cinema gained 200 times in value (market links not denied), the man who grew the potato, at the most doubled his cost. This yawning gap was not sustainable once the markets get linked (invariably), nationally and internationally. This was the crux he told me.On the other hand, he added, it was not feasible that rice and pulses be sold at Rs. 100-200/kg.and in between lay the unpredictable and meandering river of politics! Sure enough, two months later, Mr Joshi dropped in for a chat, and told me that a politician had relieved him of his WTO duties. Neither he nor I was surprised. I had also begun to realize that even in medicine, mediocrity fetches the bulk.In Darwins quote, survival of the fittest, the word fittest perhaps denotes adaptability of a fox more than it denotes the strength of the lion, or the structure of the dinosaur.A wise government would like to take an opportunity in reforming the system.In its basics, the matter is of production of that which feeds the nation, as well contributes the largest chunk to the national economy, and the prices it should fetch in the market, so that the production is lucrative enough for people to invest and put efforts in this production.The answer lies in all the nitty-gritty that farming is about. Not to deny that government units may be working on it, the seed production units at much less subsidies, can increase yields many folds, for a component that grows naturally.Before one talks of outcomes, investments have to be made in infrastructure. Irrigation schemes, river linking have to pick up priority, much like that for industrial growth.I believe much information is being provided on fertilizers and indigenous soil additives as compost. They need to be capitalized on. I believe with better electricity farmers co-operative mini compost plants would be seen more frequently on the landscape.There is a case of hybrid seeds for certain crops, where there is enough evidence that there are no long- term effects on health. The damage done by pesticides should not be forgotten.Loaning to farmers at lesser rates has a limitation, and as other benefits as MNREGA, should be specific and should have checks that money is transferred, and that it is utilized for an agreed purpose.Finally, what the farmer requires are good fund managers. Money earned during a bumper crop is likely to flow to liquor barrels. It may be sagaciously invested for a rainy day or a non-rainy year.Advance advice on crop suitability worked on basis of demand or congestion of forward delivery chains nationally, and internationally is extremely crucial. Such knowledge is on the back of the palms of the commodity market players, as well as the government. Such information should be part of the fund manager and advisory units that should have every farmer enrolled in his area, and advice be given in one to one encounters. It is heartening to see a few apps by some Bangalore-based companies provide all such information to the farmers.Lastly, comes the question of the government allowing private participation in certain sectors in farming, exports, to make the outcomes comparable, publishable, replicable, and without intending much-reliable!Just heard the Chief Minister broke his fast on the second day. No further changes in the compost policy have been announced!Blog-breaking news! Maharashtra has just announced a loan waiver! Brave! Bharat and India are learning not to cheat on each other!Main chhahta bhi yahi tha, wo bewafa nikley,Usey samajhney ka koi to silsila nikaley(Maybe I wanted her to expose her disloyalty,Perhaps that was the only way to understand the affair)"

The department conducted a training session-cum-exhibition on Saturday, which was attended by as many as 500 vegetable and fruit farmers from Thondamuthur block. The event familiarised the farmers with drip irrigation systems, use of hybrid seeds, modern farming techniques like shade net and pro-tray, all of which consume less water and produce a good yield.Thondamuthur, one of the main vegetable cultivation belts in the district, has around 70% of cultivable lands covered by drip irrigation. But hardly 50% of them are in working condition, said horticulture department officials. ""We want to achieve 100% coverage in the block, which will be beneficial for the farmers,"" said deputy director A Ramakrishnan. ""On an average, a farmer uses about 25 litres of water a day to irrigate a coconut tree. However, most of that water goes to waste. It is also a massive waste of money. By installing a drip irrigation system, they can save at least 25% of the irrigation water,"" he said.""The State government has allotted Rs 22.02 crore for installation of drip irrigation systems across 3,665 hectares in the district,"" said Ramakrishnan. ""If the fund does get over, we can get funds from other districts,"" he said.The farmers were also told to cultivate a mix of vegetables. ""If you have four to six acres of land, do not cultivate tomato across the land, as you can not manage its water requirement. Instead, you should cultivate tomato, eggplant and lady's fingers, so that even if the price of one vegetable drops, you can earn an income by selling the others,"" said Ramakrishnan.Professors from the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) educated the farmers on the use of shade net, use of polyhouse, biofertilisers, vermicompost and use of hybrid seeds. ""Hybrid seeds are better cultivated in pro-trays because there will not be competition among the seedlings for water and nutrition. They will all grow to the same length within 25 days and can be transferred to the field,"" said PR Kamala Kumaran from TNAU . ""But, hybrid seeds are expensive and can not afford to be wasted,"" he said.Many farmers expressed apprehensions about installing drip irrigation systems and using hybrid seeds. ""I did not install drip irrigation because the farmland in Chadivayal is close to the forests and wild elephants might destroy it,"" said C Kannaiya , a farmer."

The Centre has decided to construct 500 cold storage chains across India.Union minister of agriculture Radha Mohan Singh, who was in Gandhinagar to attend the Textile India-2017 exhibition told TOI that these cold storage chains would be useful in helping farmers get better price for the produce and thereby increase their income.Regarding Gujarat farmers demanding a minimum support price for potato, tomato and onions, Singh said that the country already has a list of crops for which minimum support price has been announced. ""But currently there is no plan to upgrade the list or include vegetables in this list,"" Singh said.When told that farmers in Gujarat were throwing their produce away because of low support prices, Singh said that they should use cold storage facilities.Speaking at the seminar on 'Productivity and Product Diversification Challenges for Natural Fibres,' Singh said that natural fibres are the backbone of Indian textile industry. He said that despite stiff competition from synthetic fibres, the demand for natural fibres was steadily increasing with a growing population.The minister further said that given the limitation in increasing area under cultivation, the only way to improve production is increasing productivity. He said that introduction of high-yielding varieties, best agronomical practices, efficient fibre extractors and effective utilization for diversified products will improve productivity. Cotton is produced in over 90 countries across the world, and over 60% of that production comes from India, Singh said.Union textile minister Smriti Irani said the textile ministry and agriculture ministry have decided that the two ministries will have a regular exchange of information, knowledge and feedback on best practices . She said textiles is one of India's leading industries and has the potential to generate employment for millions of people throughout the country. The knowledge sharing will be in local languages so that farmers get the information and are not left out because the information was not a language they did not understand."

Legend has it that the craft was patronized by Tipu Sultan during times of drought to help the people of Channapatna earn a living. He brought a family of artisans from Persia to make wooden columns and later wooden toys to ornate the columns.Later, when the famous Mysore doll industry started dwindling, all the dolls for Dasara were made in Channapatna, and that's how the tradition lived. The craft flourished and hit its peak in the 70s and 80s when wooden napkin rings were exported in huge numbers.""This was Channapatna's golden period. But soon demand for flat toned finish picked up, affecting the traditional lacquering of tonal gradation. This continued for a good 10 to 12 years. Then buyers found cheaper places such as China and other Asian nations for these products,"" says Atul Johri.""Although a few groups and individuals continued to make the traditional wooden wares but the craft started losing its sheen as the tonal gradation techniques were lost owing to mass production in order to compete with the Chinese replicas, and lack of skilled artisans. This also led to people leaving Channapatna for odd jobs in Bengaluru,"" he adds.""The replicas first land in Mysuru and then come to Channapatna, and sold along with the toys made here. The government has barely done anything to check this influx.The replicas were so cheap that the units and artisans in Channapatna couldn't sustain the competition and many started selling the cheap foreign imita tions, which was more profitable,"" says Ali Khan, a fourth genera tion craftsman.The government con ducts training workshops but they haven't been of much help to the artisans in Chan napatna.With no focus on the market dynamics for domestic and global consumption, these trainings are of little benefit. And, after the workshops, the artisans are left with no work and end up doing odd jobs.The training kits distributed by the government includes impact drill and handsaw among other things.""These are useless for artisans.The kits were received by all and sundry. A tomato seller who got the kit sold it to me for Rs 2000,"" says Yusuf Ali Khan whose family has been living in Channapatna for the past 50 years. He said there were 300 to 400 artisan houses a decade ago, but today it's less than 100."

While retailers do not link the increase with GST, they feel an apprehension of overall increase in prices in the new tax regime has prompted middlemen to jack up prices. They have also cited less buying by retailers during rainy season as another reason for supply shortage in local markets.In retail markets , increase in average prices is ranging between Rs 10 and Rs 15 per kg. So far, the worst hit has been tomato which has seen a decline in supply and a sharp rise in prices. During the past fortnight, tomato price has increased by around Rs 15 per kg. ""We sold tomato at Rs 40-45 per kg even two weeks back. Now it is being sold at Rs 60 per kg. We are told that there has been a dip in supply of the Bengaluru crop,"" said Gopal Kundu, a vegetable retailer at Lake Market. Tomato prices have actually shown a sharp rise across the country in the past 10 days following crop damage due to rain in tomato-producing states like Haryana.""We receive the bulk of tomato from Maharashtra. But supplies have gone down substantially in the past few weeks. This has created a supply shortage in the wholesale market. As a result, prices of tomato has almost doubled in the past week,"" said Uttam Mukherjee, chief supervisor of Koley market.Other vegetables, including striped gourd (parwal), ladies finger (bhindi), brinjal and onion, have also recorded increase in prices at city markets. ""At Maniktala market, prices of vegetables like striped gourd, ladies finger and brinjal have increased by around Rs 10 per kg in past two weeks. So far, there has not been any report of crop damage from rain in neighbouring districts. But, price is still rising,"" said Kartik Saha, a vegetable vendor at Maniktala market.""Government has said there won't be any impact of GST on vegetables. But we have seen a steady rise in prices in past two weeks, especially after the Eid. It seems the middlemen are taking advantage of fears over the new tax regime,"" Kundu said."

But, there seems to be no respite in sight for Hyderabadis from the spiralling vegetable prices.

Even Rythu Bazaars have revised their rate cards increasing the prices by 20-30 per cent in comparison to last week, said consumers ruing how bitter gourd, cauliflower, carrot, capsicum and French beans too have become more expensive in the last few days.""I was shocked to find the local supermarket selling to matoes for `70. Even roadside vendors are now quoting that price.

While items like carrot, they said, was being transported to the city from Delhi, Indore, Ooty, Chikkaballapur, green chillies were being procured from Kurnool, Uttar Pradesh and Meerut ""There is a shortage of some vegetables which has led to rise in prices. We are trying to ensure that there is constant supply of tomatoes and chillies by bringing them from Madanapalle which is the major supplier of tomatoes.

Then, the traders depend on Madanapalli giant tomato market in Chittoor district. Similarly, local traders depend on Guntur, Krishna and Berhampur in Odisha for green chillies in the current season.

Excess rainfall crippled tomato production in Madanapalli,"" said G Prasad, estate officer of the Kancharapalem Rythu Bazaar Meanwhile, the IMD officials said south coastal districts have been receiving excess rainfall due to monsoon being active in the region and formation of a trough off the south Tamil Nadu coast.According to Prasad, the city needs nearly 80 tonnes of tomatoes daily. Nearly 50 per cent of the city's total requirement is contributed by 13 Rythu Bazaars in the city.""All traders, including those at Rythu Bazaars, depend on Madanapalle for tomatoes and Guntur and Berhampur districts for green chillies.

Since both my parents were teachers and would often be busy with work, I would cook basic dishes like khichdi and burji for myself. My love for food turned into my passion when I moved to Delhi for my higher studies. I had to cook for myself and that is when I started to explore. I was exposed to a lot of fresh ingredients and spices as I stayed very close to Azadpur Mandi, which was one of the largest vegetable markets.I decided to pursue a career in food and in 2003, I joined the Institute of Hotel Management, Bhubaneswar. It was a completely new experience for me. A new city, new cuisine and dishes like ghugni (snack), dalma (rice), and chhena poda (sweet) were all completely different from what I was used to in Delhi.I was 18 when I entered the industry and I worked with The Oberoi, Kolkata.There again I came across a completely new and different burst of flavours and dishes like rasgullas, sandesh (sweet), jalebis, kala jamun and much more. From Kolkata, I went straight to Kerala, in 2010 for a year, where I fell in love spices like the black pepper, cinnamon, mace, etc. We got fresh fish right out of the water. We were also part of an Ayurveda camp, wherein we had to cook food according to the prescriptions given by doctors for guests who were on medication. I also learnt to make sadhya, (means a feast), karimeen polichathu and Kerala sambar.In 2011, I went to the US and worked at the Steakhouse. There I learnt the fine tuning of steaks with expensive meat products. I also got the opportunity to work for the Carnival Cruise Lines. I travelled to different parts of Mexico, South America and Europe, where I got my hands on the best tomatoes, wines and cheese. I have been with Marriot Chennai since May 2017.I am so glad to have got such wonderful opportunities to travel to different places and explore so much of food, because it has really helped me grow as a chef. I have noticed that Chennai has a mixed set of cuisines, like Udipi, Chettinad, Andhra and so on.I am yet to master South Indian cuisine, but I am quite confident about the North Indian cuisine. Butter chicken, mutton rogan josh, chole, rajma chawal and karimeen pollichathu are some of my best dishes.Meen PollichathuIngredientsCleaned fish steaks/filet: 20 pieces, 1 kg (measured after cleaning)Turmeric powder: 10 gmPepper powder: 20 gmSmall onion: 200 gmCrushed ginger: 50 gmCrushed garlic: 50 gmGreen chilli: 20 gmChilli powder: 50 gmCoriander powder:50 gmTomato: 200 gmCoconut milk powder: 20 gmSalt: 20 gmCurry leaves: 5 gmCoconut oil: 30 mlBanana leaf: 1 bigMethodMake gashes on both sides of the cleaned fish.

Also, the children at a tender age had to handle head loads of 20 to 25 kg at the markets.Though some children wanted to return to their places, they had to desist from the move as neither they nor their parents received wages, Mr Dhanasekaran said.The rescue parties would visit the market places and pulp units elsewhere in the district to check the menace.District Collector P.S. Pradyumna instructed the ICDS and Childline wings to eradicate child labour in Chittoor by June 30."
5a05fce79855b76bf13c299d,The ‘shahi’ flavour,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/the-shahi-flavour/article19091467.ece,2017-06-17,"I have a friend from Hyderabad who often turns his nose up at the Muslim food of other regions, and especially that of Delhi. He is convinced that it is his old city (forget the fact that he has not lived there for decades) which has the best Muslim cuisine in India. Well, its true that Delhis food is called Lashkhari, that is, it the food that was eaten by soldiers. I am all for it, and can happily feast on Dillis kababs and nihari. But I must admit that my Hyderabadi friend has a point. That the cuisine has been enriched by the royal family of Hyderabad  the Nizams  is an undisputable fact.In fact, the biryani that I love the most is the kuchchey gosht ki biryani from Hyderabad. Long years ago, another friend who grew up in Hyderabad would make it a point to come back to Delhi with tubs of biryani from his home city every time he went on a visit there. And we would devour it in silence, and thank him profusely  but only after wed eaten every morsel, for we raced to see who could eat the most at the shortest possible time.I was reminded of that glorious biryani some days ago when a friend at ITC Maurya invited me to a royal festival that the hotel has been organising. Every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, there is a banquet at The Pavilion celebrating the food of a former royal family  of Sailana and Hyderabad (which are over), Akheraj (June 16-18), Kangra (June 23-25), Kashmir (June 30-July 2), Rampur (July 7-9) and Bhainsrogarh (July 14-15).Heart of malai!I enjoy the food of Kangra, though, after spending several weeks there, way back in the eighties, I must admit I got a bit tired of the khatti dal that I ate every day and everywhere. I have had great encounters with Kashmiri, Rampuri and Sailana royal food. I recall eating a kabab cooked with the guler fruit and a shikampuri kabab, with a heart of malai (instead of hung curd), prepared by the Sailana scion in Delhi some years ago. The taar korma of Rampur is an eternal favourite, and I enjoy everything Kashmiri from the gushtaba to the rishta.But I think my favourite is still the food of Hyderabad. The Salar Jung festival at the hotel included some of the best known Hyderabadi dishes  including kachchey goshti ki biryani and hari mirch murgh masala. The biryani was the way I like it, fragrant rice, perfectly spiced and with deliciously tender pieces of meat. In this style of cooking, the juices of the meat get infused in the rice, and I suppose that is why I enjoy it so much.The chicken dish was excellent, sharp in taste and pleasant to look at, thanks to the green chillies, and a taste of tamarind and mustard. There was a paneer timatari  cooked in a nicely tart tomato curry. What I also enjoyed was the arbi kalimirch  a dry dish of arbi that had been in coated with carom seeds and black pepper.Surprisingly, the dish that didnt appeal to me was the jafrani machli, cooked in yoghurt and an almond paste. I found the gravy too thick, and the fish itself much too bland.I think the festival should have included the royal food of Bhopal. I find their rezala, mildly green in colour because of the use of coriander and mint leaves deliciously different. Theres a school of thought (based in Bhopal, of course), which believes that the royal food of Bhopal is particularly good because unlike elsewhere, begums were the rulers there.But I am not getting into this war of whose royal food is the best. Let them all bloom, and happily tickle our palates. And my Hyderabadi friend can turn his nose up as much as he wishes to."

The prices of several vegetables have spiralled this month, as a result. Even a bunch of mint and coriander leaves costs Rs. 40 due to the severe water crisis in places in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka where the plants are grown.Traders at the Koyambedu market said the market now receives only up to 250 truck loads of vegetables daily compared to the usual 350-400 trucks. S. Chandran, president, Koyambedu Market Licensed Merchants Association, said several vegetables are now at least 40% costlier than last month. Usually, the prices of vegetables that escalate during summer begin to drop from mid-June. But, as the drought situation continues across the State and also in neighbouring States, vegetables may remain expensive till July, he said.Onion, tomato and potato are the only vegetables that are priced at Rs. 20-Rs. 25 per kg. Cabbage and snake gourd are also being preferred more by some customers as they are priced at Rs. 20-Rs. 30 a kg in the wholesale market. Several customers have cut down on their volume of purchase. Beans and carrots are expensive.Low yieldP.Sukumar, joint secretary, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flower Merchants Welfare Association, said: Even the locally grown green chillies and brinjals are priced high this month as the yield is less across the State. Vegetable prices have been increasing for three months. But Ramzan has helped to keep sales up, he said."

The farmers of main crops such as rice, turmeric, millets, bajra and all horticulture crops could manage only 50 % of their regular production this season. This has affected the arrival of vegetables to the farmers shandies and other markets in the district.Due to the steep fall in the arrival, the prices of vegetables have shot up by about 30 % in the shandies, according to official sources.Small onionThe price of small onion remained as high as Rs. 100 per kg in the shandies and also in the open markets.The price of tomato that stood at Rs. 15 last week, rose to Rs. 22 per kg on Friday in the shandies; the price of carrot has gone up to Rs. 72 from Rs. 60 last week.Similarly the price of beans stood at Rs. 70 per kg; brinjal stood at Rs. 36 per kg; ladies finger Rs. 30; chillies Rs. 46; potato Rs. 24; raddish Rs. 25; beans Rs. 70; snake gourd Rs. 28; flat beans Rs. 50; beetroot Rs. 40, and cabbage Rs. 28.However, the price of big onion has registered a downward trend. The onion is priced between Rs. 15 and Rs. 18 per kg.A cross section of the farmers who market their produce in the farmers shandies said the price of all the vegetables invariably has increased in the last one-and-a-half month, due to fall in production. The prices of the vegetables are expected to continue to remain high for the next one month or so, they added."

It requires eight months of growth and the tuber grows on vines and underneath the soil.With low sugar content and high calories, it is advisable for diabetics too. It can be kept for a year and its taste appeals to children, says Peter. A single plant yielded 12 kg adathappu last year, he says, pointing to a sapling in front of his house.Like many endemic tuber species, adathappu too was on the path of oblivion. Peter then started cultivating them with other traditional vegetable varieties that too faced extinction.Among them were native brinjal, ladies finger, chilly and tomato varieties.It was his interest in conserving native plant varieties and animals that led Peter, an instructor at an engineering college, to take up farming as a vocation.He liberally shares the seeds of crops and vegetables with farmers. Only if other farmers too grow them can our vast traditional species be protected, he says.Pest-resistantThe traditional species may not be highly profitable for farmers but they score on pest resistance and adaptability to climatic changes when compared to hybrid varieties, he says.Peter collected his plant and animal wealth over a decade of search, most of them from tribal settlements.Some tribes and traditional agriculture families still protect their seed wealth, which is the only reason for their survival. With the change in food habits, many vegetable varieties have disappeared from the culinary table, Peter says. One can spot native varieties of cattle such as High Range Dwarf, Vechur Cow, goat species of Malabar, and nadan kapri and karinkozhy chicken species at his farm.An important feature of our animal wealth was its adaptability to the topographical condition of a particular area like the High Range Dwarf. However, it is confined to some pockets and needs protection, he says."

Many of the eateries in rural areas have done away with serving tomato chatni.The horticulture farmers of Vazhappadi and surrounding areas usually raised tomatoes, brinjal, bhendi, avarai, pumpkin, drumstick, raddish, snakegourd, kottavarai etc. Vazhappadi block is a major tomato production centre in the western belt.The daily market in Vazhappadi town received tomatoes round the year from the farmers of Vazhappadi and surrounding areas and also from Arunutrumalai and Kalvarayan hills. The traders from not only Salem district, but also from Namakkal, Villupuram, Cuddalore, too visit the Vazhappadi daily market for procuring the tomatoes through auction.Due to acute drought conditions, there has been a sharp fall in the production of tomatoes in Vazhappadi and in the Kalvarayan hills, leading to steep hike in its price.A box of tomatoes containing 25 to 28 kg which was priced at Rs. 600 by the end of last month, has gone up to Rs. 1,200 in the last two days. A 10-kg basket of country tomatoes are being marketed at Rs. 500.The tomatoes are being marketed at Rs. 60 in the local markets.According to M.G.R. Palaniswami, a wholesale dealer of tomatoes at Vazhappadi daily market, there has been a sharp fall in the arrival of tomatoes in the daily market for the past few days. Harvesting of tomatoes has come to an abrupt end in villages on the Kalvarayan hills. The Vazhappadi market daily market which was receiving about 600 boxes of tomatoes during last month, at present is receiving only 100 boxes.Mr. Palaniswami pleaded for a cold storage facility for storing the tomatoes during the peak season and market the same at reasonable price whenever there is shortfall in the arrival of the same from the villages. The farmers and traders have been pleading for this facility for a long and the government should take steps for commissioning this facility immediately, in the interest of both the farmers and consumers.The price of tomatoes have registered upward trend in uzhavar santhais too in the district.The price of the tomatoes which remained at Rs. 28 per kg last week has risen to Rs. 35 on Wednesday."
