5a0637f19855b76bf13c4575,‘Sexy food and good storytelling’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/sexy-food-and-good-storytelling/article19191900.ece,2017-07-01,,The Hindu,"Openings, especially long-delayed ones, go through their own hype cycle with the restaurant doing its best to keep the wave cresting, rather than come crashing to shore.In case of the long-in-the-making Slink & Bardot, its unique menu, much-loved location and passionate team, each contributed to keep the curious continually engaged much before it opened on May 15. The French restaurant and lounge is made up of four distinct rooms, which are inviting, cosy and yet in the case of the bar, appropriately moody. The vibe here is not stuffy, but instead veers towards a small plate-inspired brasserie that happens to put out clean flavours and inventive cocktails.For the partners behind the eatery, Canadian Nick Harrison and French chef Alexis Gielbaum, the long journey to the launch has been filled with its own ups and downs. The two met while working at Delhis Le Bistro du Parc in 2014 but their endeavour to set up Slink & Bardot started in earnest in February last year, at a dinner at St Judes Bakery, for all of 12 people.A secret pop-upThe dinner, was paid for out of pocket by Harrison and Gielbaum, and served as a showcase for the restaurant that the duo wanted to open in the city. We were looking for investors, we were looking to see what we could do, says Harrison. In attendance were Riyaaz Amlani (who Harrison had been in touch with for about two years), food writer Roshni Bajaj Sanghvi and her husband, as well as Mangal Dalal of Restaurant Week India and his wife, Karishma.Harrison recalls, Basically, we did a small plates menu, very much in the tone of what were doing now. It was a 12-course menu called, The Stereotypes of French Cuisine, Theyre All True and Thats Awesome. The offering instead of sporting names came with phrases such as The French think lighting food on fire makes it better (strawberry charlotte with runny lime and berry flamb); The French undercook their food (grapefruit cured gravlax with salmon eggs, capers, and fermented daikon Chantilly); and French food is cheesy (chicken sous vide with filo wrapped camembert and blue cheese foam) to name a few. I think thats a lot of what the industry is right now, is contextualising, and giving people a reason why its interesting and why they should care about it, says Harrison. Simply delivering good food just isnt enough any more.He continues that ultimately, several of those dishes from the dinner did find their way onto the restaurants a la carte menu now. For instance the French food is rich dish which was confit lamb croquette with lavender jus and The French eat their wine which consists of buffalo cheek bourguignon with fondant potatoes and red wine jus. For the dinner itself, there were setbacks, like the fact that the fridge broke down, and the duo had to buy all of their produce again, as almost everything had spoiled. In the end though, the meal won Amlani over and he came onboard as an investor.Passion and pedigreeThe partners have extensive experience with food but the challenges that have accompanied the opening of this restaurant have been many. Harrison has studied at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, and has worked in London and Ibiza. Similarly, Gielbaum has worked in kitchens in France, Japan, Italy and on the Orient Express. The produce is different, and even the products that you have, like carrots, tomatoes, onions, that obviously we have in France [but here, its] different, says Gielbaum. I really needed to start from scratch. Most of what I am expecting to have is not available, obviously. In France you work with very different kinds of vegetables and meat than you have in India.As a result, for Gielbaum, the challenge was to choose a recipe that could work without compromising on taste, given the constraints. That said, dishes on the menu rarely crack the Rs. 500 mark, and the eatery is sourcing about 90% of their produce from the local market, except for, a few cheeses, charcuterie and Belgian pork belly.As a passion project and restaurant, Harrison and Gielbaum have been able to stay true to their initial meal, working through delays. As Amlani told Harrison subsequent to the dinner, It was the sexy food and good storytelling, that sold him. And the restaurant partners are excited about finally showcasing their food, drinks and more to the city.Slink & Bardot , Thadani House, Worli. Phone: 6002 8555."

Traders at the Koyambedu market noted that 1 kg of tomato costs up to Rs. 45 in the wholesale market and Rs. 5-Rs. 10 more in the retail market.The market gets only around half of its usual 60 truckloads a day.Traders said Koyambedu usually gets tomatoes of different varieties from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. As summer was harsh this time, the yield has been less.S. Chandran, president of Koyambedu Vegetable Market Licensed Merchants Association, said, Many customers are buying only a quarter of what they usually purchase, especially when it comes to tomatoes, carrots and beans that are costly. This has pulled down the sales by 30% in the wholesale market. While carrots cost up to Rs. 55 a kg, beans are priced at Rs. 65. Green peas and small onions are also among the expensive vegetables and are being sold for Rs. 100-Rs. 110 a kg in the wholesale market.Change likelyTraders expect the prices to stabilise slightly when the Tamil month of Aadi begins in mid-July as weddings and functions are not held then and the demand will come down. But tomatoes are likely to cost more till August or September, when the next harvest is due."

The 25-year-old chef heads operations at Le Cirque Signature, at the Leela Mumbai and has created a special food and wine trail thats been inspired by his hometown, Lucca in Tuscany near Florence. The menu includes several family recipes. On Sundays, after mass, my mother would buy fresh seafood and make gamberoni, baked prawns in orange lemon base, Severini cheerfully shares with us.For the chef, Tuscany is the fragrance of rosemary and thyme. And, pecorini reminds me of home, which I havent been in six years, and beef, he grins. Native Tuscans eat simple food, vegetables grown in their backyard, herbs collected from mountains and fresh catch from the sea. They rarely use eggs in their food and their bread is baked without salt. Thats because our cuisine is very powerful. The only challenge I face here is the [in]consistent availability of ingredients. I usually create menus depending on whats available. So many laws change overnight, I cant keep up, he quips, telling us about the one time his vegetables got caught in customs. They were stale by the time I got my hands on them. I sent them back! he exclaims.After a hearty chat, he leaves us to try the food, starting our journey with two types of bruschetta delloste (Rs 1,050). One is a raw tomato, and the other a herby porcini on a pillowy polenta with has a crisp coating. The tomato needs seasoning but the porcini is juicy and gets the taste buds going. The cacciucco alla viareggina (Rs 1050), a seafood soup, has clams, oysters, prawn and chunks of fish in a thick broth which we wash down with a watery Merlot Dazante from the region.In a chat with us, Severini had expressed his concern about creating vegetarian dishes but it feels like needless worry when we taste the gnudi senesi (Rs 1,250). The no-frills dish is a ricotta spinach gnocchi on a bed of tomato puree that woos the palate with every bite. This is how we eat it at home, Severini quips. Next up is tordelli lucchesi rewind (Rs 1,650), is lamb ravioli with a lamb ragout. We savour this with a sangiovese cabernet sauvignon, Castello Banfi.The sommelier for the evening, Margaux Pavoncello, tells us about French grapes that were planted in Tuscan region, giving the wine a distinct character, acquired from the terra. The weather and soil play a very important part in the flavour, she explains, as we sip the medium bodied wine.For our mains, the vegetarians dish is fagotto Florentino (Rs 1,150). The name gets the Florentino title owing to the spinach stuffed in a filo pastry shell with mushrooms. The second dish is the recipe that Severini has borrowed from his mother, the gamberoni arrosto (Rs 2,150) in which succulent prawns sit on orange and lemon mayonnaise base, which gives the dish a much-needed citrusy lift. We wish there was more of this sauce though. A Sangiovese Cabernet Merlot matches the dish, and is a whole bodied, woody experience. While the food shouts Italian yet none of the dishes are clichd presentations. There is barely any use of basil, and its a pleasant change to eat robust Italian dishes.Severini joins us for the dessert course which is cantucci e vin santo (Rs 750). For the custard, I break a Tuscan cigar, which is second best after a Cuban roll, and add it in the food smoking gun, he explains. What looks like slices of bread are cookies kneaded with dryfruits. The server pours the custard, which comes in a thick sauce consistency, over it. The burnt flavour lingers in our mouth, gently offering sweet solace from the cookie in every bite. A traditional recipe that Severini has given his own modern twist.Tuscany Food and Wine Trail ongoing at Le Cirque Signature, The Leela Mumbai, Andheri East till June 30The only challenge I face here is the [in]consistent availability of ingredientsLorenzo SeveriniChef"
5a0645099855b76bf13c4dc7,Ensure fair deal for Indian farmers,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/615639/ensure-fair-deal-indian-farmers.html,2017-06-05,,Deccan Herald,"DH News Service, Jun 5 2017, 23:54 ISTFormer Union agriculture minister, late Chaturanan Misra often used to say: The real agriculture minister in India is the rain god. Thanks good monsoon, the third advance estimates of foodgrain production is 273.38 million tonnes in 2016-17, higher than the second advance estimates in of 271.98 MT and final estimates of 251.57 MT in 2015-16. Farm growth for the full fiscal has zoomed to 4.9%, compared with a near flat 0.7% expansion in 2015-16. If the forecast of the India Meteorology Department (IMD) for this year holds true, the grain output will set a new record, boosting the growth rate. This is good news for the economy. After two years of back-to-back drought, in 2014-15 and 2015-16, we can look forward acche din (better days) in future.Increased production does not necessary mean more income for farmers. In fact, the pattern of bumper crops and dejected farmers has become a recurring feature of Indian agriculture. Farmers in some states are regretting their abundant yields this year as the prices of agricultural commodities have crashed. Chilli farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, tomato growers in Karnataka and pulses cultivators in Maharashtra are confronted with a severe crisis that has witnessed prices fall by more than half in a matter of just weeks. Even Punjab, known as the granary of India, has turned into a hotspot for farmer suicides. The Centre last month informed the Supreme Court that over 12,000 suicides had been reported in the agricultural sector every year since 2013. The states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu accounted for over 87% of them.According to the Economic Survey 2016-17, the average annual income of a rural household in 17 states is a paltry Rs 20,000, less than the annual mobile bill of some upwardly-mobile citizen in a city. This is primarily because the benefits from his labour are cornered by intermediaries in the market. Instead of the policy obsession with agricultural growth rates, the focus must shift to ensuring fair deal to the farmers. Apart from effective implementation of marketing reforms recently initiated by the Centre through the model Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act, this require more and better managed investment in agriculture. In 2014, the BJP had come to power promising profitability in agriculture by ensuring a minimum of 50% profits over the cost of production, cheaper agriculture inputs and credit, introducing latest technologies for farming and high-yielding seeds, and linking MGNREGA to agriculture. After three years in power, the government is nowhere near even partial fulfilment of those promises."

Israel also assisted India during two wars with Pakistan in 1965 and 1971, according to this 2009 article in the Stanford Journal of International Relations.India reciprocated during the six-day war in 1967 by providing Israel with spare parts for French-made Mystere and Ouragan aircraft as well as AX-13 tanks (also French-made), the Stanford report said.The highlight of the partnership was Israels supply of artillery shells during the Kargil war in 1999 when India faced a shortage.In the late 1990s, a crucial defence deal was the Indian purchase of Barak 1, an air-defence missile, bought specifically for its capability to intercept US-made Harpoon missiles deployed by Pakistan.Read | Modis Israel visit: Defence and fighting terror are pillars of bilateral tiesIndias imports of unarmed vehicles (UAVs) have almost all been from Israel.

I have been working at Chap Chay, The Raintree Hotel, for about six months now.I have been exposed to different varieties of food since my childhood. I have always understood and loved different cuisines and flavours. My brother and the chefs I have worked with in the last 12 years have inspired me. Every place that I have been trained in, I have learned and mastered a different cuisine under some of the best chefs. From Mumbai I learnt Japanese cuisine, a couple of Thai dishes from Bengaluru, from Chennai I learnt a lot of Chinese dishes and from Kolkata I picked up a couple of Cantonese dishes. So every place has made me a better chef and has taught me a lot. My specialities however are my Japanese, Chinese and Thai food.Each cuisine stands apart in terms of authentic flavouring. For example, we use a lot of tangy flavours in Shanghai food and in Cantonese and Chinese dishes we use very little spice. But we adjust the flavours as per the taste of the customers. In Chennai, people prefer more spices and tanginess, so even the authentic Chinese flavours have to be changed.I think my best and also my favourite dishes are dimsums. I also did a dimsum festival at the hotel recently. I love experimenting with dimsums and create new flavours. Broccoli and cheese dimsums, scallop and prawn dimsums, pork bun dimsum, beef dimsums are some of my most favourite varieties. I try out different varieties because nowadays people look for new and unique flavours.I have received a lot of appreciation for my broccoli and cheese dimsums. Mostly people prefer their dimsums with a dip, so I tried a couple of varieties with the kind of dips too. I tried four kinds of dips keeping in mind the kind of flavours and taste that guests want  spring onion and garlic, tangy chilli sauce, roasted sesame sauce and tomato and onion cold sauce."

(Express/Narendra Vaskar) With kharif sowing already at the half-way mark, farmers say the fresh loan may just come too late. (Express/Narendra Vaskar)Even as the Maharashtra government extended the countrys biggest ever loan waiver package to cover an even greater number of farmers by including all overdue crop loans disbursed since 2009, farmers across the state are reporting their inability to access fresh credit.Amid doubts over conditions imposed for eligibility for the loan waiver, and with the cooperative banking network in deep crisis, farmers have been unable to access any institutional credit more than a fortnight after Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis announced that a fresh line of credit worth Rs 10,000 would be made available immediately to all eligible farmers. And with sowing for the kharif season already at the half-way mark, farmers in regions that have witnessed acute agrarian distress over the past three to four years say the fresh loan of Rs 10,000 may just come too late.Nivrutti Gangurde of Kotamgaon village in Nashiks Niphad taluka had earlier in the year taken a loan of Rs 2 lakh for his daughters wedding. Unable to raise a fresh crop loan as he was unable to clear previous dues, he had to borrow informally from somebody in the village, at higher rates of interest, for the kharif season. I have been overdue since 2014  none of the banks was ready to sanction any loan. In order to meet the operational expenses for my acre of tomato I had to borrow around Rs 2 lakh from a moneylender this year, he says.For Maharashtras farmers now, there is water but no liquidity In Tuljapur talukas Salgara Devti village in Osmanabad district, farmer and postwoman Archana Bhosale says everyone is being turned away from the local bank. Similarly, in Nandurghat village of Beed, local journalist and farmer Amol Jadhav says those visiting the Maharashtra Gramin Bank branch have been told instructions regarding fresh credit havent arrived yet.Across the state, lead bank managers for agricultural loans say the fresh loan of Rs 10,000 promised by the government cannot be extended in the current circumstances where eligibility criteria have been repeatedly tweaked since the announcement and with no master circular from the Reserve Bank of India to all banks on writing off crop loan accounts that are non-performing assets (NPAs) or bad loans.The government and the RBI will have to clearly state which NPAs are to be written off, only then can fresh credit be offered. And banks have seen next to zero recovery ever since the loan waiver demand began to pick up. With nobody making payments on old loans and with no detailed intimation from the government on how to proceed, local banks actually cannot offer fresh loans to anyone, though there are requests every day, says the lead bank manager in one of Marathwadas districts. The Maharashtra Gramin Bank, a regional rural bank, is the only one to have issued a circular to its branches on the loan waiver and fresh credit, but sources say disbursals have remained very low despite demand.The Gramin Bank services 17 districts, including all of Marathwada where the district central cooperative banks are mostly weak or defunct. Chief Manager for Credit and Refinance K D Joshi says a circular was issued as per the directives of the state government to all 408 branches, but concedes that there is confusion regarding eligibility. The criteria are changing daily. Now all loans disbursed since 2009 that are overdue as of June 30, 2016 are eligible, but the government has not issued a circular about this. Until there is a firm eligibility criterion, some confusion will remain, he told The Indian Express.Other bankers say farmers are also a confused lot, some hoping to have multiple loans in multiple banks written off, others simply unaware of the conditions to be fulfilled before the mortgage record can be wiped clean from their 7/12 land extracts. Meanwhile, the distressed district central cooperative banks inability to service customers has added to the slow pace of farmers accessing fresh credit. The Nashik District Central Cooperative Bank (NDCCB) had, by the end of June last year, disbursed over Rs 1,200 crore in crop loans. Once known for its robust financial health, the bank has this year disbursed only Rs 61.41 crore  six per cent of its set target of Rs 1101.05 crore  till now. Chairman Narendra Darade blames the continuing impact of demonetisation for the situation. We do not have cash with us. How are we to disburse money to farmers, he asks.The confusion and consequent glitches in extending fresh credit to farmers eligible for the waiver comes after an already slow crop loan season for Maharashtras banks. By the end of June 2016, of the Rs 37,677.03 crore target for kharif loans, banks had disbursed Rs 20,889.20 crore  a healthy 55 per cent of the target. However, by the middle of June this year, of the targeted Rs 40,547.20 crore, only Rs 9,249.22 crore had been disbursed  barely 23 per cent of the target. On expected lines, district central cooperative banks that disburse around 40 per cent of crop loans have been the worst performers. They have disbursed Rs 5225.94 crore, or 40 per cent of their target of Rs 13108.38 crore. At the end of June 2016, these banks had disbursed Rs 10,451.77 crore of their targeted Rs 13,113.57 crore  80 per cent of the target.Simultaneously, sowing has continued despite the crisis in institutional credit. With healthy water levels in dams and local water bodies, nearly 40 per cent of the kharif sowing is now complete, with over 56 lakh hectares of farm land already sown in anticipation of the promised normal monsoon. At this time last year, only about 13 lakh hectares of farmland had been sown. Villagers say many have turned to private moneylenders in the absence of farm loans from banks. Worse, in some parts of Marathwada, villages actually completed sowing, enthused by the June rainfall, and a dry spell since the end of June has many worried about the likelihood of having to undertake a second sowing, called dubaar perni, a chronic and crippling additional cost for farmers in rainfed and non-irrigated parts.In Dhamangaon village of Ashti taluka, a drought-prone region, for example, a plentiful monsoon in 2016 has ensured theres plenty of water for drinking. But it hasnt rained since the end of June. If it doesnt rain in a week or 10 days, we will have to go in for a second sowing, says deputy sarpanch Dr Syed Bashir. Dhamangaons farmers have sown urad, moong, bajra and cotton and are now concerned about the young crops health at a crucial growth stage.With the weather office predicting a relatively dry July, farmers in Ashti expect they may have to sow a second time. If the promised fresh loans are disbursed now, the money will at least be handy for that, says Dr Syed. If it comes much later, whats the use?Minister of State for Agriculture Sadashiv Khot admitted to receiving complaints about non-disbursal of crop loans from various districts of the state. I will be meeting the chief minister on Friday and ask him to look into the matter. I will also be requesting the district guardian ministers to take weekly meetings with the lead banks and follow up about loan disbursal, he said. Khot signalled that banks who had failed to provide credit on time would face action.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Even as the State got its share of rains, price of the vegetable continues to skyrocket.Sources said, tomato is priced at `70 to `80 a kg in the open market which is almost three times the cost of the vegetable that was being sold at `25 a kg a month ago.The unprecedented price rise has been attributed to supply crunch. While the Capital city requires 100 tonnes of tomato daily, it is now getting half of it. Apart from the locally grown crops, the State depends mostly on Karnataka for the vegetable.According to traders, the red vegetable was priced at `100 a kilo at the Unit-IV market on Thursday. The price, however, came down to `70 on Friday though in some areas it is being sold at `80 a kg.Secretary of Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said the price fluctuation in the market depends on the demand and supply. The supply has been very less from the tomato producing States, he said.Blaming the State Government for the situation, he said, farmers in Keonjhar and Angul region were forced to sell tomatoes at throwaway price during summer. The Government could have purchased the vegetable from the farmers at a reasonable price and stored it for the season. Unfortunately, despite repeated demands, it has failed to set up required number of cold storages, he pointed out.The traders alleged that the retail price is high compared to the wholesale price as the Government has failed to control it. The retail price is 20 to 30 per cent high than the wholesale price, Panda said claiming it should be 5 to 10 per cent depending on the commodity. We are expecting a change in price after the arrival of fresh crop from Maharashtra and Hassan district of Karnataka in next 15 days, he added."

Now, the farmers dont have to worry about middlemen, he said.The consumers in Kerala who had been shelling out high prices fixed by private suppliers for vegetables can now get fresh vegetables with prices prevailing in Agriculture Producers Marketing Committee markets in Mysuru. He said they sell tomato and pumpkin for Rs 6 per kg and started procuring chilli at the prevailing prices in APMCs.He said farmers are saved from paying commission and nobody is there to cheat farmers here.The company that has entered into an understanding with a few societies in Kerala takes services charges.

In what is being regarded as a consequence of short supply, tomato prices have gone up to ` 75 to 80 per kg.Vegetable vendors at the Gudimalkapur wholesale market say that they have incurred huge losses as there are few takers for the pricey tomatoes and some other vegetables.Jaya, a vendor, says, Due to the excessive rains, a lot of vegetables on the farms have spoiled. We are suffering huge losses. For each carton of 25 kg of tomatoes supplied to us, we are paying `1,500-1,600 at present. Yet, most of the cartons dont hold a quantity beyond 22 kg. Such is the scarcity of vegetables in the market. This price hike has led to considerable reduction in customer footfall in the last three days.It is not only the case of tomato but beans too are being sold at ` 70 a kg in many places. As for green chilli, its wholesale rate is ` 80, says K Vamshi, a frustrated buyer at the mandi.It seems impossible to buy vegetables with this kind of price hike. Imagine I have bought 250 gm of chilli for ` 25 just now, laments Md Naeem, a resident of Mehdipatnam.The GST is followed by high vegetable prices. What can the common man do? Tomato is commonly and widely used and I am now forced to pay ` 75 for it. Has the government any consideration for people? fumes Chandani Adhikari, a tech analyst who lives in Begumpet.Another vegetable vendor, L Padma, has this to say: The unfavourable rains and the mishmash at the vegetable market have completely disturbed the demand-supply balance. A lot of vegetables being supplied to us are not of good quality. Today, out of the one quintal of tomatoes I was supplied, 15 kg were rotten.Ravindar Kumar, secretary of Agricultural Market Committee, Gudimalkapur, explains, A lot of vegetables are spoiled because of the unfavourable rains. This happens in the month on June every year but the sale has come down this year. If the situation continues to remain like this, the vegetable market is likely to see a further dip of 10 to 30 per cent in sales.But monsoon is favourable for some vegetables. The rains, on the other hand, have helped in the cultivation of some vegetables. For example, most of the farmers in Nalgonda district have started cultivating dondakaya as the weather is just appropriate for its cultivation, observes Kumar.Sale prices exceed those fixed by AMCA contrast was seen between the prices at which several vegetables are being sold in the market against their retail prices fixed by the Agricultural Market Committee, Gudimalkapur. Tomato is being sold at I80/kg against the fixed price of I54/kg, cauliflower at I70/kg against I32, French beans at I70/kg against I42/kg and green chilli at I80/kg against I62/kg."

From the villages of Jongksha, Thynroit, Pingwait, Iewrynghep, Thangbnaiand Pyngkya, falling under the Mawkynrew community and rural development block of East Khasi Hills, the farmers today complained of distress because of low returns, disproportionate to the investments made by them on various agricultural produce. These villages, which are around 40km from here, are known for cultivating potatoes, tomatoes, French beans, cabbage and broomsticks, among others. They are part of more than 100 villages under the block with a population of not less than 50,000, and where almost all the households are engaged in agriculture. ""The farmers are distressed because agricultural produce do not fetch a good price. The price is disproportionate with what they have invested,"" Jongksha village chief Olet Kharsahnoh, who came along with a group of farmers to the news conference, said. For instance, he said, this year, the price of potatoes per kg which is being sold by the farmers to the traders is a mere Rs 8-10 while the investment made per kg is not less than Rs 15. With no minimum support price for the produce and with the absence of government regulation, he said the farmers are at the mercy of ""middlemen"" who take them for a ride. But that is not all. If the returns are low, the farmers are further distressed with the lack of manure. ""The state government has been propagating the use of organic manure. But there is dearth of organic manure, and hence we are forced to purchase chemical fertilisers at a high price from the black market,"" Kharsahnoh said. Thynroit village council secretary Harkin Warjri pointed out that several farmers have availed of loans of Rs 50,000 from the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme. But because of the low returns, they have been unable to clear their debts. ""We hope that the government will waive off the loans. This would alleviate the farmers' problems,"" Warjri said. Augustine Lyngba, chief of Iewrynghep village, said even those farmers who cultivate broomsticks are facing a difficult time. ""Last year, we could still manage to sell the broomsticks at Rs 60-80 per kg. But this year, it is in the range of Rs 10-37 per kg while the investment is Rs 40-60 per kg,"" Lyngba pointed out. However, he could not pinpoint the reason of this sudden fall in price. Betel leaf planter and chief of Pyngkya village, Kyrshan Pyngrope, demanded that the government should recognise betel leaf as an agricultural product and not as a forest produce. ""Through betel leaf cultivation, we are actually helping in the conservation of trees. We are also planting trees wherever required as part of the cultivation. We have been explaining this to government officials but till date betel leaf has not been recognised as an agricultural produce,"" Pyngrope said. After enlisting their woes, the farmers now want the government to regulate the prices of agricultural produce, and come up with a minimum support price for the products, besides waiving off loans and providing manure. ""The farmers are usually described as the backbone of the economy. But this is mere rhetoric as nobody cares for us,"" Warjri said."

If the daily expense for vegetables was Rs 150 earlier, it has gone up to Rs 250 now. This is affecting the family budget.According to consumers, the price hike of tomato, green chillies and drumstick has left them in a lurch as these items are essential for many dishes. I dont think the soaring price of vegetables will have an impact on upper-class families. But it will be a herculean task for middle-class families to make ends meet, said Thanusha, an ophthalmologist working in a private hospital.However, many feel there is no considerable hike in the prices of veggies post GST.

The country is in the midst of a severe food oversupply, say experts, and farmers are selling their produce for prices less than what they spent growing them.It is also a reflection of demonetisation, when farmers did not have cash to buy seeds for Rabi season. The lack of resources, borrowed money, bumper crop and low demand reflect todays inflation numbers and farmers distress, says economist Arun Kumar.Painting a further grim picture of the economy, factory output for the month of May grew at a meagre 1.7 per cent, compared to 8 per cent last year.The subdued growth in manufacturing is worrying as some major sectors like capital goods, automobile and textiles have shown degrowth. This underlines the need for major reforms to improve the investment climate, said industry body FICCI secretary Didar Singh.It was food prices, that have a weightage of 49 per cent in inflation calculation, which brought the overall numbers down. Vegetable prices are in negative territory for the 10th straight month and pulse prices for the 7th straight month on yearly basis, says Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Adviser, SBI in report.Low inflation is not necessarily a good sign in the long run, says Seema Sharma Economist at IIT Delhi. More so because current numbers fall below the Reserve Bank of Indias tolerable levels that ranges between 2 and 6 per cent.It is a bad sign RBI will not be guided by June numbers, but by what happens in July, because it is the first month of GST and it will try to examine the impact on economy. Its likely that RBI may hold current rates, said Kumar, indicating that the new tax regime might make a repo rate cut unlikely.The government, however, has a different perspective. It feels these are reflections of a consolidation process in the ongoing macroeconomic activity. The number of 1.54 per cent is historically low and reflects the firm and ongoing consolidation of macroeconomic stability, Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian said.Tomatoes, however, defied economics with prices skyrocketing above `90 in Chennai. Traders blamed it on demand in Andhra and Karnataka."

Grocery stores are brimming with meats and cheeses from Europe and Turkey, and just last month the country's main port received 4,300 cars and sheep from Australia.Luxury hotels like the W and St. Regis serve lavish meals around the clock and alcohol flows for visitors. Famous Barcelona soccer players Gerard Pique, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba met with fans last week at a mall in the capital, Doha, which will host the 2022 World Cup tournament.""We don't feel any difference. It's a celebration everywhere,"" Qatari Badr Jeran said as he shopped at the mall.Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt moved to isolate Qatar in early June, severing diplomatic ties and closing off their air space and shipping lanes over Doha's support for Islamist groups across the region, many of which are viewed as terror groups by its rivals. Qatar denies supporting extremism and has condemned the closures as an attack on its sovereignty.Worried residents rushed to grocery stores, emptying shelves of dairy products and other food imports after Saudi Arabia sealed Qatar's only land border, but they were quickly restocked.If the Arab nations intended to bring about a change in government, those hopes appear to have been dashed by an outpouring of popular support for Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the 37-year-old emir. Signs on cars and billboards read ""We are all Tamim. We are all Qatar"".Here's a look at how Qatar has weathered the crisis:___MONEY  LOTS OF ITShortly after the crisis began, a Twitter account called DohaUnderSiege began documenting life under the blockade. One post showed a fully stocked hotel buffet and said: ""Breadlines have begun. Personally saw several middle-aged men at breakfast scuffling over the last baguette.""The tongue-in-cheek posts point to the fact that Qatar is fantastically wealthy. It is one of the world's richest nations per capita, making its citizens on average wealthier than even those in neighboring Gulf states.Qatar has a population of around 2 million, but only a little more than a quarter-million are citizens, meaning the government has a lot of wealth it can spread around.Qatar has some $340 billion in reserves. Around $40 billion of that is in cash plus gold, and $300 billion is in reserves with the Qatar Investment Authority, according to central bank governor Sheikh Abdullah Bin Saoud Al Thani. Qatar's sovereign wealth fund has invested strategically over the years in international luxury brands and real estate in major cities like New York and London.___ENERGYQatar's main source of revenue is its natural gas, which continues to flow uninterrupted. It is the world's largest liquefied natural gas producer, which it ships on tankers around the world. An undersea pipeline provides gas to Oman and the UAE, which heavily relies on Qatar's gas despite severing diplomatic ties.The crisis has actually served as a ""a good sort of trial run"" for the Qataris to determine how to manage their economy in the face of such an event, said Noha Aboueldahab, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center think tank.Costs have increased for the government because of the roundabout routes that need to be taken to fly or ship food and other goods into the country, but she says the added expense has yet to be felt by shoppers.The government says it's covering a ten-fold increase in shipping costs for food and medicine.___HELP FROM FRIENDSQatar's ally Turkey and its neighbor Iran have quickly stepped in to fill any gaps, as has Morocco. Instead of carrying the Saudi Almarai dairy brand, the shelves are now stocked with milk and produce from Turkey.One of the reasons cited for the Arab nations' decision to cut ties was Qatar's relations with Iran, with which it shares a massive undersea natural gas field. But here too, the blockade seems to have had the opposite effect. Iran's kept its airspace open, allowing Qatar Airways and other airlines to circumvent the closures.Past investments in desert agriculture have also helped head off any food crisis. Despite the sweltering, arid climate, farmers have found ways to grow organic produce like tomatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, eggplant and champignon mushrooms inside greenhouses.___NEW ROUTESSince the Arab quartet's June 5 blockade was announced, Qatar has launched five new shipping routes  two to Oman, two to India and one to Turkey.Doha's brand-new Hamad Port, south of the Qatari capital, is operating at ""full capacity,"" says the port's director, Abdelaziz Nasser Al-Yafei. The facility, part of a $7.4 billion port infrastructure project, only began general cargo operations in October, and was fully up and running in early December.Maersk Line, which had previously shipped much of its Qatar-bound cargo via Jebel Ali, has retooled its operations to keep Qatar supplied via Oman.Hamad Port received 212 ships in June, with 24,000 containers, 4,300 cars, 61,000 livestock and 6,400 tons of construction materials. On one evening earlier this month, five large ships docking in Hamad Port unloaded sheep from Australia, food from Turkey and cars made in South Korea.The peninsula-nation can also look to its national carrier to fly in goods. Qatar Airways, one of the region's biggest airlines, operates 200 aircraft, including 21 cargo planes."

Grocery stores are brimming with meats and cheeses from Europe and Turkey, and just last month the countrys main port received 4,300 cars and sheep from Australia.Luxury hotels like the W and St. Regis serve lavish meals around the clock and alcohol flows for visitors. Famous soccer players Gerard Pique, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba met with fans last week at a mall in the capital, Doha, which will host the World Cups 2022 games.We dont feel any difference. Its a celebration everywhere, Qatari Badr Jeran said as he shopped at the mall.Spain's national team soccer player Gerard Pique (L) signs his autograph on a soccer ball to the fans in a shopping centre in Doha. (REUTERS)Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt moved to isolate Qatar in early June, severing diplomatic ties and closing off their air space and shipping lanes over Dohas support for Islamist groups across the region, many of which are viewed as terror groups by its rivals. Qatar denies supporting extremism and has condemned the closures as an attack on its sovereignty.Worried residents rushed to grocery stores, emptying shelves of dairy products and other food imports after Saudi Arabia sealed Qatars only land border, but they were quickly restocked.If the Arab nations intended to bring about a change in government, those hopes appear to have been dashed by an outpouring of popular support for Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the 37-year-old emir. Signs on cars and billboards read We are all Tamim. We are all Qatar.Heres a look at how Qatar has weathered the crisis:Money  Lots of itShortly after the crisis began, a Twitter account called DohaUnderSiege began documenting life under the blockade. One post showed a fully stocked hotel buffet and said:Day 3 of siege. Breadlines have begun. Personally saw several middle-aged men at breakfast scuffling over the last baguette #DohaUnderSiege pic.twitter.com/ijnGQd1CBe  DohaUnderSiege (@DohaUnderSiege) June 7, 2017The tongue-in-cheek posts point to the fact that Qatar is fantastically wealthy. It is one of the worlds richest nations per capita, making its citizens on average wealthier than even those in neighbouring Gulf states.Qatar has a population of around 2 million, but only a little more than a quarter-million are citizens, meaning the government has a lot of wealth it can spread around.Qatar has some $340 billion in reserves. Around $40 billion of that is in cash plus gold, and $300 billion is in reserves with the Qatar Investment Authority, according to central bank governor Sheikh Abdullah Bin Saoud Al Thani. Qatars sovereign wealth fund has invested strategically over the years in international luxury brands and real estate in major cities like New York and London.EnergyQatars main source of revenue is its natural gas, which continues to flow uninterrupted. It is the worlds largest liquefied natural gas producer, which it ships on tankers around the world. An undersea pipeline provides gas to Oman and the UAE, which heavily relies on Qatars gas despite severing diplomatic ties.The crisis has actually served as a a good sort of trial run for the Qataris to determine how to manage their economy in the face of such an event, said Noha Aboueldahab, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center think tank.Costs have increased for the government because of the roundabout routes that need to be taken to fly or ship food and other goods into the country, but she says the added expense has yet to be felt by shoppers.The government says its covering a ten-fold increase in shipping costs for food and medicine.Help from friendsQatars ally Turkey and its neighbor Iran have quickly stepped in to fill any gaps, as has Morocco. Instead of carrying the Saudi Almarai dairy brand, the shelves are now stocked with milk and produce from Turkey.One of the reasons cited for the Arab nations decision to cut ties was Qatars relations with Iran, with which it shares a massive undersea natural gas field. But here too, the blockade seems to have had the opposite effect. Irans kept its airspace open, allowing Qatar Airways and other airlines to circumvent the closures.Past investments in desert agriculture have also helped head off any food crisis. Despite the sweltering, arid climate, farmers have found ways to grow organic produce like tomatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, eggplant and champignon mushrooms inside greenhouses.New routesSince the Arab quartets June 5 blockade was announced, Qatar has launched five new shipping routes  two to Oman, two to India and one to Turkey.Dohas brand-new Hamad Port, south of the Qatari capital, is operating at full capacity, says the ports director, Abdelaziz Nasser Al-Yafei. The facility, part of a $7.4 billion port infrastructure project, only began general cargo operations in October, and was fully up and running in early December.Maersk Line, which had previously shipped much of its Qatar-bound cargo via Jebel Ali, has retooled its operations to keep Qatar supplied via Oman.Hamad Port received 212 ships in June, with 24,000 containers, 4,300 cars, 61,000 livestock and 6,400 tons of construction materials. On one evening earlier this month, five large ships docking in Hamad Port unloaded sheep from Australia, food from Turkey and cars made in South Korea.The peninsula-nation can also look to its national carrier to fly in goods. Qatar Airways, one of the regions biggest airlines, operates 200 aircraft, including 21 cargo planes."

Authorities are struggling to find a reason for the difference even after the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) system removing separate taxes at the frontiers.In fact, the vegetable suppliers incur only transportation cost, said Joseph Sebastian, a vegetable vendor. Yet, they are charging an unfair price. We cant understand the reason for such a huge difference as Cumbum is only 23 km away from Kumily.The biggest difference is in the price of cucumber. While it costs Rs 15 per kg in Tamil Nadu, it is sold at Rs 50 per kg in Kerala. There is a difference of up to 50 per cent in the price of other vegetables. However, the price of a few other items are a notch higher in Tamil Nadu.Oops! They go through the roofThe prices of vegetables soared in the retail market in Palakkad district sharing its border with Tamil Nadu. The price of cowpea is Rs 60 per kg, while ladies finger is Rs 70 per kg. The price of tomato was Rs 50 per kg and onion touched Rs 110 per kg. Madhu, a vegetable merchant from Koduvayur, said as it was not seasonal, the prices were on the higher side. Ramesh, a consumer, said the budget was going haywire even for a small family. It costs Rs 300 to Rs 500 to purchase vegetables for a week.Salad days are here again Residents of the district can now dig into their favourite vegetarian dishes without feeling the pinch. The retail markets in Kozhikode witnessed a considerable decrease in the price of vegetables after the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST)."

But due to incessant rain in that state, movement of vehicles has been affected in last one month. We see supply of close to 150 truckloads of vegetables every day, but now hardly 50 of them are arriving. Again, this is a month of marriages and functions, so a lot of supply is going there. This have invariably pushed up prices.Idrees Chaudhary, general secretary of Russell Market Traders Association says, Even at places like Devanahalli, Kolar, Bangarpet in Karnataka, from where we get vegetables, most of the crops have been damaged by rain.Interestingly, for several months, tomatoes were being sold for anywhere between `7 and a maximum of `20. Consumers are perplexed with the sudden rise.Tomato is something that we use almost in every recipe. With the prices shooting up, it has become very difficult for middle class people like us. We cannot limit our consumption, neither is our income going high any time soon. I guess we have no other option but to bear the brunt, said Nikhil Kumar, a software engineer.Venkat Krishna, a manager at the online food-startup hungermeals.com in HSR Layout, points out, We deliver meals at very affordable prices to offices and homes.

Despite the loss, we have to serve the same quality of food to our consumers.

This has led to a sharp fall in arrivals in Chennai which usually gets 800 tonnes of tomato a day. It has shrunk now to 400 tonnes.Apart from the meagre quantity of tomato from Krishnagiri, which accounts for only about five per cent, the traders at Koyambedu pick up bulk of the produce from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.We used to get tomatoes from Dindigul, Theni, North Arcot, Vellore, Dharmapuri, Kaveripattnam etc. But because of the failed monsoon and farmers not getting enough money for their produce, there is a scarcity, added Thiagarajan, urging the State government to look into the issue.Vendors, too, have demanded timely action from the government to solve this problem. Water scarcity and other woes faced by farmers must be addressed soon to prevent the prices from rising further. Skyrocketing prices are a pain to both vendors and public, said S Senthil Kumar, a trader at the market.While the price of tomatoes has gone up substantially, those of other vegetables, though slightly high, are more or less stable, said M Abdul Khader, joint secretary, Koyambedu Wholesale Merchants Association.A key ingredient in Tamil cuisine, tomatos steep price is really burning holes in the pockets of people here.

Located in a gorgeous old-Bengaluru house with the soft sounds of Malyalam songs playing in the background, the ambience makes you forget that theres a busy main road right outside.This outlet recently held a Syrian Christian food festival, focusing on the traditional food made in the homes of the Syrian Christian community. On hearing this, anyone familiar with the cuisine of this community, would expect the festival to be a meat lovers paradise. The festival menu, although vast and mouthwatering, stood out for being in the form of a black-and-white newspaper, filled with little nuggets of facts on the cuisine and the community.To start the meal, we were served a refreshing drink comprising tender coconut water, mint leaves and honey. Next came the starters, and though the menu has several options to chose from, we were served the Aattirachi Cutlets (mutton cutlets) accompanied with beetroot chutney and the all-time Kerala favourite, Erachi Ularthiyathu (beef fry). Both dishes were splendid  while the cutlets were melt-in-mouth, and beef fry had the right dose of spices and cut pieces of coconut. We also tried the Kanava Peralan (a dry squid dish prepared with onions and tomatoes) - this was slightly disappointing as the masalas hadnt mixed with the squid well, and lacked flavour overall.For the main course, the Meen Pattichathu (fish curry cooked in an earthen pot) was what we tried first. The fish was tender and fresh and the gravy was just the right consistency, with a heavy dose of coconut and kokum. Served with Kappa Vevichathu (tapioca cooked and mashed with onions, garlics and green chillies), it was mild (despite the bright red colour) and flavourful at the same time. Next, we had the appams with Chicken Ishtew (chicken stew). The appams lacked the crispiness one usually expects, and the centre was lumpy rather than fluffy. The stew on the other hand, was comfort food at its best - rich, coconut-y and with a generous dose of pepper. In fact, the stew was so good that we were able to forgive the rather disappointing appams. Amid all this meat, what we really enjoyed was the pairing of the popular Puttu with a thick lentil gravy, the combination, which we were told is ideally a breakfast dish, was surprisingly good for such a simple dish.For dessert, we were served a tender coconut payassam. This was a miss personally, as the taste of coconut was far too overwhelming. While we wanted to try some of the other desserts on the menu, especially the fried bananas served with a scoop of ice cream, we were told that none of the other desserts were available. Even when it came to the seafood dishes on the menu, a lot of them were unavailable, which was disappointing to say the least, especially after teasing us with such a vast menu.The Syrian Christian food festival got over yesterday, but several of the dishes are available on the regular menu as well.Cost for two: Rs 1,000 (approx)"

While capsicum is selling at Rs 80 per kg, drumstick, cauliflower and coriander leaves are available for Rs 60 per kg. To kill the taste buds, prices of garlic and ginger have increased to Rs 80 per kg while green chilly is sold at Rs 100 a kg.Commonly used vegetables, including brinjal, ladys finger, radish, bitter gourd, ridge gourd, cow pea, beetroot and carrot are sold at Rs 40 per kg. Only the price of teasel gourd has come down to Rs 30 from Rs 60 per kg a week ago. Prices of pointed gourd and plantain are moderate at Rs 30 per kg while cabbage and pumpkin are selling at Rs 20 per kg.Sources said bulk of the vegetable demand of the city is met by farmers of Nuagaon, Bisra, Lathikata and Kuanrmunda blocks and adjacent rural pockets of Jharkhand. From December-end to mid-February, vegetable prices had dipped to unprecedented levels amid surplus production of locally grown vegetables. Then 3 kg of tomato was priced at Rs 10 and cauliflower was sold at Rs 10 per kg while garden pea and capsicum were sold at as low as Rs 12 and Rs 20 per kg respectively.Sundargarh Deputy Director of Agriculture RN Satpathy said shortage in supply of vegetables from July to September due to monsoon rain is common leading to price hike. He said vegetable crops grown on upland by farmers from mid-June are likely to reach the local markets in the next 45 to 60 days and hoped that prices would then come down."

He carefully feeds the old destitute woman who cannot even sit up.T Periyasamy and his friends have been doing this without missing a single day for nearly six years. Wednesday was the 292nd week of feeding destitute on roads. What began as a rare human compassion has now become an obsession for Periyasamy and 30 volunteers of Amudhasurabi project.The project offers full meals with water packets every afternoon to 100 persons in Salem City and to 500 persons on Sundays for destitute in the city and rural areas. Periyasamy runs an electrical shop near the old bus stand while the volunteers are from various walks of life. But none, including Periyasamy, is well off financially but seem to have a rare resolve to help the most helpless.Thirty per cent of the cost is supported by non-volunteers while the rest is pooled by the volunteers. They have set up a dedicated kitchen at Seelanaickenpatti. A paid cook prepares the food every Sunday. The volunteers gather at the kitchen on Sunday at 5.30 am and share the work like cleaning, vegetable cutting and food packing.At 11.30 am they leave to give the food to the hungry. On week days food is out-sourced for cash from a reliable source. We ensure that the lunch reaches the people by 1.30 pm every day. We have not missed even a day till date since we started. Most of whom we serve have been deserted by family. We look for people who cant even take a step to receive the lunch packet.In many cases they cannot even eat on their own and volunteers have to feed them literally, not just give the food packet and move on to the next.Water packets were added to the lunch offer when one day I saw an old woman who gets food regularly from us crawled up to the nearby drainage to wash hands and shockingly she also drank the drain water, he says.Recounting the journey, Periyasamy said that initially he visited old age and destitute homes run by NGOs and charitable trusts to offer some help. But he found that help was never scarce for such institutions. But those are on the roads sides and pavements had none to help.First I started giving idlis to 20 persons. But I found many were keeping it for more than a day till it rot. Later I tried giving lime and tomato rice which too ended same way.

That really motivated me to take the full plunge."

Addressing a roadshow here on Saturday, Secretary of Union Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) JP Meena said the eastern State has tremendous opportunity in the area of food production and processing.""But lack of processing and related infrastructure is resulting into a significant amount of food wastage. We have laid significant focus on food processing and are expecting the industry to witness an investment of about `60,000 crore in next three years,"" he said.He urged the Odisha Government to develop food processing industry in clusters as it requires special infrastructure and said if the infrastructure can be made available at a nominal rate then the industry will witness an exponential growth.""We are major producer of fruits, vegetable, milk, rice and wheat. Yet, we import tomato, pineapple and many other things. Because, the problem lies with the way we are managing our agro-production. Retail-end is fragmented as many do not have storing facilities. So far, only 10 per cent of the total production in the country is being processed,"" Meena maintained.The roadshow was organised by MoFPI in collaboration with the CII to invite Odisha-based industrialists to participate in the event. Speaking at the roadshow, State MSME Minister Prafulla Samal highlighted the growth prospects in Odisha. He expected the vibrant agro and food processing industry of the State will witness growth and generate many employment opportunities through the event.Additional Chief Secretary LN Gupta said Ministry of Food Processing has approved establishment of two mega food parks in the State to link agricultural production to the market by bringing together farmers and processors under one roof.""Odisha has made large strides in the food processing sector and the State's policy and regulations have made it easier for investors for doing business here,"" he said.Among others, Chairman of CII Odisha State Council and Nalco CMD Tapan Kumar Chand and Director of MoFPI Atul Saxena also spoke."

In Luzon, the provinces of Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur surprised me pleasantly: rich heritage structures that stood the test of time and traditions that are still in vogue. Long before the Spaniards came to the Philippines, settlements already existed along the coves in the northwestern part of Luzon. This region was a progressive trading post renowned for its gold mines, familiar to the ancient Japanese, Chinese and Malay traders.As I journeyed northwards, the jeepneys (initially made from the US military jeeps left over after the Second World War, since been developed into colourful public service transport, ubiquitous throughout the country) got smaller and the tricycles (like tiny auto rickshaws) even tinier. Zaza Santiago, my guide complained jokingly, Our tricycles are so small, we find it hard to squeeze into them. Especially after shopping, the tomatoes roll out from my bags and no place for more people.Zaza picked me up from Playa Tropical Resort Hotel to take me to Vigan, a fascinating town (also a Unesco World Heritage Site) in Ilocos Sur, the second Northernmost place in the Philippines. One of the new seven wonder cities of the world, Vigan is one of those few towns left in the country whose old structures have mostly remained intact, and the place is well known for its cobbled stone streets and the unique architecture - a fusion of Native Philippine and the Colonial Spanish styles. Vigan Heritage Village (Kamestizoan District) is replete with ancestral houses that date back to the 18th century, with ancient tile roofs, massive hardwood floorings, balustrades and azoteas in varying Spanish- Mexican-Chinese architectural designs.The Bantay Church features both baroque and gothic influenced architecture. The statue of Our Lady of Charity is an old treasure, made of wood and ivory. Its belfry, a few metres away was used as a watchtower for approaching enemies. There was a horse drawn cortege standing in front of the church, with the picture of a deceased lady: it was decorated with white balloons and flowers.Listening to the sacred music at the funeral service, I joined the line, paid respects to the departed soul, and received the Holy Communion. It didnt matter to me that the departed was a stranger.Neither did it matter that I am a staunch Hindu - what mattered to me was respecting a tradition/faith.A quick look at St Paul cathedral was followed by a visit to Pagburnayan, the traditional earthen jar-making industry in Vigan that was introduced by the Chinese in the 14th century. They were used for fermenting vinegar, wine, salt etc. A buffalo was going around in circles, stamping the clay. The potter turned the wheel and produced some lovely pieces of art. I bought some pots as souvenirs and a paper mache Kalesa, which is a horse drawn carriage, a popular mode of transport.Syquia Mansion belongs to a wealthy Chinese - Filipino family in Vigan. It was the residence of the former president Elpido Quirino. Turned into a museum, it showcases the lifestyle of the rich and the famous in the early 1900s. The floors are made of huge stone slabs called piedra, which came all the way from the Chinese merchants who used them to weigh down their empty ships before loading in the goods coming from Vigan City.The opulence of the family is seen through the numerous paintings hanging on their walls, foot-wide hardwood planks, antique furniture, glass chandeliers and draped capiz windows. The whole mansion wraps around a central courtyard found, not on the ground floor, but at the second floor of the house.After a lovely ride in a Kalesa through the cobbled streets of Vigan, we had lunch at Cafe Uno where the Vice President of Philippines also was expected that day. We had avocado shake, tilapia fish, garlic rice, fried chicken and halo halo for dessert which consists of evaporated milk, ice cubes, cheese, lots of sugar, grated coconut, kaong, gelatine etc.Post lunch we travelled to Ilocos Norte to see the imposing St Augustine Church in Paoay, with its picture perfect faade and the three-storey coral bell tower. The church is famous for its Earthquake Baroque Architecture that is an interpretation of the European Baroque adapted to the seismic condition of the country through the use of enormous buttresses - there were 24 in all. A wedding was underway - bridesmaids of all ages fully decked up and eagerly waiting for the ceremony to start. Zaza was keen to show me the Sinking Bell Tower that is located in the busy centre of Laoag City, close to the public market. It is believed that the historic tower is sinking at a rate of an inch a year, though no one is completely sure why.I headed home the next day, with rich memories of my travel to a country that has so much to offer, and with such a warm heart!

Its price in the Hopcoms outlets, as on Thursday, was Rs 90. Chairman of the Hopcoms outlets G R Sreenivasan said, just a month ago, the vegetable was being sold at Rs 10-20 per kilo. He said the prices are expected to come down a bit from today.Sreenivasan said, the reason for the steep prices was, ironically, its once-upon-a-time low price. He said, Six months ago, farmers didnt maintain the crop well because the price was low. At one point, the price had become as low as Rs 5-6 per kilo. Also, the number of tomato growers is usually very less during summers.He added that farmers have a herd mentality, wherein if one farmer does something, the rest would tend to follow suit. These factors have created a shortage in the market, which has driven up the price, he opined.By next month the prices should be back to normal, he added.When asked if the lack of rainfall was a factor, he denied it. He said it was in fact heavy rainfall which spoiled the tomato crop, resulting in price hike.Prices of a few other commodities have also increased. Banana of the yelakki variety is sold for Rs 83 at Hopcoms outlets, while the cost of various varieties of grapes ranges from Rs 39-75."
5a071f3e9855b76bf13c7dc3,Is inflation falling or steadily rising?,http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2017/jul/24/is-inflation-falling-or-steadily-rising-1632615.html,2017-07-24,,The New Indian Express,"MUMBAI: Retail inflation at 18-year low in June sounds alarming and strengthens the case for rate cuts. But look closely. Inflation isnt falling. Its going up.The misconception is because inflation is widely misread.Its a measure of how much more we pay than last year to achieve the same level of well-being.Inflation is measured every month, but DOES NOT reflect sequential change  the price difference of this month over the previous month  but for say June, 2016 to June, 2017.When the data comes out, its invariably compared with previous month leading to divergent views than that of the RBIs. Retail inflation in May was 2.18 per cent and Junes 1.54 per cent makes you believe its in a free-fall mode.But, if you see month-on-month data, prices are going up. From Januarys 130.3 points, general inflation index in June printed at 132.1 points. Ditto with food inflation, partly explaining why monthly budgets have no respite from falling inflation.Inflation also reflects a change in the base price, not accurate prices. Tomatoes retailed at Rs 3,000 per quintal in Bengaluru both during June 2016 and 2017, but in reality, prices rose, which economists blame on seasonal gyrations. Vegetable prices remain sticky every monsoon. Thats nothing new, says Dr Sowmya Kanti Ghosh, Chief Economic Advisor, SBI Economic Research.Food and fuel account for 57 per cent of the CPI basket, but its direct influence on monetary policy is limited and thats why the RBI seems unperturbed. Low inflation breeds weak economic activity and a rate cut can boost spending and investment, which is why the Ministry of Finance has been pushing hard for cuts.The dominant view is that the RBI is moving too independently, and isnt seeing what everyone else is experiencing. Because inflation is incorrectly compared to previous months data, the clamour for rate cuts is growing, but the Central bank takes a logical view, reasons Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist, Care Ratings.Critics are also pontificating about RBIs error-prone inflation projections, conveniently overlooking the inflation target itself. Strictly speaking, the RBIs Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has to maintain annual inflation of four per cent, with a plus/minus of two per cent. The MPC pegged inflation at 2-3.5 per cent for April-September.It means, Junes 1.54 per cent is well below RBIs lowest band of 2 per cent, but if you take the first quarter (April-June), theres no breach. In fact, the RBI and MPC scored quite a success, smoothly gliding down to the 2-4 target (from 7-8 per cent in 2014) in record time, but holding it here is a challenge.Interestingly, the inflation targeting mechanism was proposed by none other than the RBI Governor Urjit Patel himself. As Deputy Governor in 2014, he chaired the MPC Framework Committee, whose recommendations  including MPC creation and replacing WPI with CPI  were duly adopted in 2015 and 2016.Importantly, three of the Patel Committee members namely Patel himself, Prof Chetan Ghate, and RBI Executive Director M D Patra  are now part of the six-member MPC and to misinterpret and underestimate the collective wisdom is jumping the gun too soon. This isnt to say the MPC is fool-proof. Even with a clear target, suitable instruments and insulation from outside pressures, it cannot possibly foresee all contingencies (demonetisation, GST). Eventually, its decision depends on judgment and discretion.Now the rate cutting part. As eminent cartoonist R K Laxman once poignantly noted, for every ill, the only cure is for the RBI to cut rates. Since January 2015, policy rates are sliced to the bone by 175 bps, yet private investment is poor. How effective will a 25 bps cut next month is anybodys guess. RBI Deputy Governor Viral Acharya, whos plumbing the banks punctured balance sheets, last week made his views clear: cleaning up bad loans as a priority over rates.What does the rest of the MPC think? We will know soon.Inflation challengesIf the MPC fails its inflation target of four per cent (+/- 2 per cent) for three successive quarters, it will have to issue a public statement, signed by each member, stating the reason(s) for failure, remedial actions proposed and the likely period of time over which inflation will return to the centre of the inflation target zone."

But a little bit of chocolate now and then doesnt hurt, added American cartoonist Charles M Schulz. And honestly, as much as I love Beatles, you have got to give this one to Schulz.So, here I was at Smoor, surrounded by desserts sitting across another foodie to find out if this chocolate lounge succeeds in delivering beyond the sweet nothings.Their recently launched breakfast menu features Bircher Muesli, Eggs Benedict, Akuri with Pav, French Toast, Pancakes, Fresh Bread Basket, Fresh Fruit Platter and fruit juices. The lounge also offers healthier option such as omelettes, scrambled, baked egg whites and boiled eggs for the calorie counters.We started off with Hazelnut Cappuccino and watermelon juice. The cappuccino was brewed well and left with a creamy heart to top the smooth blend. The juice tasted fresh with no added flavours. I was also thankful that unlike the usual juices in stores, this one did not come in with a shot of diabetes. It was al naturale.With eggs being my only connect to the non-vegetarian world, the menu definitely pleased me the most as it plays out several dishes to pique your egg fantasies.I always enjoyed the desi masala-based scrambled eggs, and if you are one too, I would ask you to order the Akuri with Pav. It is the classic mix of eggs scrambled with onions, tomatoes, chilli and corianed. The scrambled mix is stuffed in a toasted pav and served hot and I suggest you dig in as long as it is on the table. Because we all know the cardinal rule to scrambled eggs. If it isnt fresh off the pan, then it is not worth your palate.For the foodie friend who joined in, nothing screamed a good breakfast meal like Eggs Bennedict. The knife cuts right through the poached egg, with the yolk oozing right over the salami disc platform placed on top of an English muffin. While the yolk and hollandaise sauce offer this gooey smoothnes, the salami and the muffin together offer a good substance and texture to the ensemble. The dish serves a good portion for one and will fill you up, but I advice you leave some room for dessert. You are at a chocolate cafe after all.Also, try the mocktails. The Green Appletini is icy, with flavours of pineapple, orange, green apple and lemon juice.We ended our meal with Pancake served with maple syrup, fruit compote and caramalised banana. The pancakes are fluffy in the middle with just the kind of brown and soft as one would like. I definetly fell hard for this one.Place:Smoor Chocolate lounge, 100 Ft Road, IndiranagarCost for two: C800 (approx.)"

It started in October when Delhi-based queer rights activist Sharma tied up with Chez Jerome, an expert in French and Indian cuisines. The French chef later stepped down and handed the reins of control to Sharma and his Italian partner Roberto.For Sharma running the cafe comes with a responsibility. ""I have to make sure that this cafe is not specifically for gay men because they already have many spaces in the city where they can hang out. They are dominating queer spaces all around the city,"" he said.With a small dance floor under an open sky and seating for around 30 people, the cafe usually opens in the evening. The menu, inspired by French, Greek and Italian cuisines, could compete with any eatery in the city.On offer are a variety of salads, omelettes, pastas as well as thin crust pizzas with traditional toppings and dips. Specialties of the house include Greek chicken potato salad, a delicate mix of potatoes, onions, tomatoes and chicken salami, Parisian salad dressed with fresh lettuce and fresh parmesan and freshly baked breads.But it's not all about food. With events like book reading sessions and trans nights, Sharma wants to sensitise his customers about queer rights beyond Section 377  the Indian Penal Code section that criminalises sexual acts ""against the order of nature"".""Obviously, the cafe is not any NGO but it also not a place where people should only come to enjoy. I want to utilise this space to revolutionise the struggle we are going through in India. The transgenders, lesbians and hijra folks of our community need more such spaces,"" said Sharma.Despite falling under the broader queer umbrella, gay men stand out from others in the trans community. As a result, transgenders don't feel safe even in those places where they should be welcome, he said.Delhi is amongst the few cities in the country where late night parties in five-star hotels welcome people from the queer community. But few trans people make it inside the elite doors. Simran Shaikh, a transgender and senior programme officer at Sexuality Gender and Rights at Alliance India, echoes Sharma and welcomes safer places for the community but associates the profound segregation more with ""class"" than ""gender"".""The segregation among the LGBTQ is only of class and not of gender. The discrimination happens when you are not associated with a particular class of a party. ""I don't foresee any such changes with these cafes and bars. There will still be class differences in particular parties where there might not be trans identified individuals,"" she said.According to LGBTQ activist Harish Iyer, homophobia within homosexuals is ""rampant"". ""It is sad but true. Just because one belongs to an oppressed community (queer) doesn't make them sensitive to everyone else. Gay men rule the roost in many spaces.""I think some gay men have an issue with effeminacy. It is just another form of misogyny that runs deep in our society. Some do so, so that they don't get noticed as gay, in the company of those who look gay,"" the Mumbai-based activist said. Praful Baweja, who is also based in Mumbai and is an activist, hopes that the workshops he has been organising will change things for the better for the community. ""Usually when one is looking for employees in any company, the person wants them to be trustworthy.Praful Baweja, who is also based in Mumbai and is an activist, hopes that the workshops he has been organising will change things for the better for the community. ""Usually when one is looking for employees in any company, the person wants them to be trustworthy.The question of orientation is usually hidden. With workshops we are trying to tell people from the community to not be bothered by their orientation. ""Usually MNCs have a diversity and Inclusion unit where gender issues are addressed, but in smaller companies they may not have such a facility,"" he said.""Through workshops we want to educate even trans people about company structures and how they can contribute in starting small scale businesses. We are also trying to facilitate information of people within the community so that they can connect to each other,"" he added. More spaces like the Q Cafe, they hope, will help in strengthening this connect."

Usually in a pot? No! A seasoned urban gardener thinks beyond the pot, way beyond the pot. For him/her, a plant grows in a container, which can be anything from an empty soft drink bottle to a broken coconut shell to tetra packs. Basically anything that can hold the most important ingredient required for a plants growth, water and soil (rather potting mix). An oil can, an unused helmet, a vegetable/milk crate, packaged wood, a good thick UV treated plastic grow bag, 1/2/5/10 litre water bottle/can, used paint bucket, PVC pipe or aata (wheat flour) bags. Plastic rice/cement bags are not advised as they disintegrate faster.Most of the pots available in the market are made out of good quality plastic. They are safe to grow edible or flowering plants. Plastic pots and grow bags typically last upto 2 years, based on the amount of exposure to the elements. Plastic paint buckets are much stronger and will last longer. But do ensure that they have been thoroughly cleaned multiple times with soap and hot/warm water. There are other options such as clay, mud, terracotta pots but they are heavier, therefore not preferred by many urban gardeners.Heres how to spot a container and the right plants for itShallow containers with about six inches of potting mix are good for growing leafy vegetables, such as mint, spinach, coriander and fenugreek. Coriander and fenugreek are one time harvest plants, so they can be grown in smaller containers, such as empty water bottles, tetra pack cartons, ice cream / sweets boxes and curd containers. Mint keeps regrowing, so a long lasting shallow container, tray/tub kind is better. Same holds good for spinach as well, since one can get multiple harvests from a spinach plant.These two boxes are from recycled wood used to grow spinach and lettuce.Creepers, such as gourds and cucumbers, require a good support structure or trellis to cling on to. Here is a wooden trellis fixed on to a plastic crate.Fenugreek growing well in another packing box.Grow non-edible flowering plants in converted old tyres. Pictured here are rain lily and aloe vera.Below is a DIY packing wood container, used by vegetable vendors. Cover all the sides with a tarpaulin sheet, they can last a few months.A brinjal plant if taken good care of, can last upto 3 years. So to provide ample nutrition a wider container like a discarded bath tub serves the right purposeFor fruit plants, youll need a large drum of capacity of 100L or more, to allow the roots some space to expand and get a good hold of the soil. If these are grown on the terrace, do make sure that they are placed nearer to the walls or on the load bearing walls, so that the weight is taken up by the columns and beams of the structure.Transplanted an orange sapling into an approximate 100 L drum.These recycled drums have been thoroughly washed and cleaned and cut into half and are being used to grow betel leaf plant. Take away containers are placed in this separately to grow coriander.Vertical gardening is a new trend, used by many restaurants, hotel and corporate offices to go green. Shown below is a very simple DIY structure, mainly used here for succulents and cacti.Succulents and cacti can be grown in small wooden boxes or in hanging glass bowls or small fancy buckets or in an old jug or in colourful planters. Since these need not be watered, they dont need drain holes.This is what a new unused packing box looks like.For bushier plants such as tomato, brinjal, capsicum or chilly, you can grow two plants in these type of vegetable/milk crates. Use a tarpaulin sheet as inner lining, so that it holds the potting mix.The following image has multiple Thai basil plants in one crate."

Seeing the demand for tomatoes, middlemen and retailers have hiked the prices. Few farmers said middlemen decide the price to a large extent.We toil in fields but the profits are taken away by others. As tomatoes cant be kept for more than three days, we have to sell it at the best available price, said a farmer in Dharwad.We sell a basket of 8kg tomatoes for about `350-`450. We also have to pay for transportation and labour charges. But in the retail market, the same tomato is being sold at `100 per kg. We sell tomatoes to middlemen as they take the entire quantity at one go, he added.Horticulture Department deputy director S B Diddimani said, Vegetable prices go up every year. But this year, the prices have gone too high. They may come down and get stabilised in another 15 days.Scarcity of rain and decrease in sowing areas are the reasons for price hike. Once tomatoes from districts like Belagavi and Kolar start arriving in the city market, the burden of price hike will be eased, he added.The middlemen at the APMC yard say they are blamed whenever the prices go up. Many retailers buy produce on credit. We pay labour charges to distribute the vegetables. We hardly get `50 to `60 profit a basket, they said.Potato farmers in Hassan a worried lotHassan: Potato farmers in Hassan are a worried lot as they incurred crop loss consecutively for five years. Moreover, the growing area of potato by small and medium farmers has been drastically decreased from 61,000 hectares to 10,087 in 10 years. Statistics available with Express show that small farmers who cultivate on less than five acres have switched over to alternative crops like maize and ginger due to crop loss. On the other hand, the farmers who are cultivating on more than five acres have leased out their land to Ginger growers. Horticulture officials are anxious as the certified seeds supplied by the department in 1,266 hectares were damaged due to dry spell. The department had brought the certified seeds from Punjab and supplied it to 2,094 farmers at a subsidised rate.The officials had promised compensation if crop loss was reported, but no action has been initiated so far.Dilemma of Tomato GrowersEvery acre approximately needs 50 gram tomato seeds and after seeds start sprouting, they will be planted.

Retail prices in the city have surged and selling between Rs50 and Rs100 a kg in different localities.Officials at the Sahibabad vegetable market said the rates have soared as the supply of local produce has stopped.They said rising retail prices in prime localities such as Indirapuram, Vaishali, Kavi Nagar, Raj Nagar and other locations have forced households to reduce consumption a bit.The present rate, depending on quality, is between Rs 60-Rs100 a kg in retail. Prices have surged drastically. We have reduced consumption but we cannot stop buying tomatoes, said Kiran Kumar, a Nehru Nagar resident.In the old vegetable market at Ambedkar Road, the wholesalers and those selling in retail are charging Rs70-80 per kg from customers, which is affecting the daily household budget.Tomato price rise will affect the common man while those with enough purchase power can still purchase the item. We have started using tomato puree and that too in low quantity as an alternative, said Preeti Singh, a Kavi Nagar resident.Officials at the agriculture marketing department said consumers will have to wait till November for a price correction as the local produce will start arriving by then.The price rise is the result of the exhaustion of the local produce, which is not coming in due to monsoon. Supplies at the Sahibabad vegetable market are mostly from Himachal Pradesh and from Pune. This is a yearly phenomenon, said Roop Singh, senior inspector.In March, when local produce was available, the wholesale prices ranged anything between Rs 900-Rs1,000 per quintal and retail prices were Rs 15-20 per kg. At present, we have wholesale prices of tomato ranging between Rs3,000-3200 per quintal and it is sold in retail at Rs50-Rs80 per kg, he added.Retailers have also cashed in and are selling at high prices in prime localities. They said supplies were procured from outside the district as the local produce finished by April."

So did green chili, which otherwise sold for no more than Rs 70 per kg till last week.The consumers in Kolkata felt the pinch even as the government alleged that a section of traders hiked the prices, taking advantage of the floods.The prices are on fire. This morning, vendors at the local market said this is only the beginning. Things will get worse in the coming weeks, said Shaktipada Sharma, a resident of Bagha Jatin in south Kolkata.Prices will rise more since supply to retail markets has fallen sharply, said Bikas Das, a vegetable vendor.Price of vegetables such as parwal (striped gourd), ridge gourd and okra went up by at least Rs 10 at different markets in the last 24 days, shopkeepers said.Admitting that floods have affected the supply chain, state agriculture minister Purnendu Bose said some retailers were manipulating the prices. The police and market monitoring committees appointed by the government are keeping a close watch. We will not hesitate to take action against hoarders, said Bose.Potatoes, the most consumed vegetable in the state, remained immune to the inflation.This happened because farmers moved their harvest from the fields to cold storages long ago. This is the time they sow paddy. But in case of other vegetables the flood has affected retail prices, said senior peasant leader and CPI(M) politburo member Hannan Mollah."

(File Photo) Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh. (File Photo)The Opposition and the ruling BJP on Tuesday traded blame in the Rajya Sabha over distress in the agriculture community due to which farmers have been committing suicides in large numbers. As the House took up a discussion on the agrarian crisis, the Opposition blamed the government for the problem, accusing it of being insensitive towards the farmers issues. They also sought to find faults in various policies of the government. The ruling side hit back, saying the present miserable condition of the farmers was due to the Congress partys rule of 60 years.The BJP members said it was the Modi government which had initiated a slew of programmes for the welfare of farmers over the last three years.Initiating the discussion on the farmers distress leading to rise in the incidents of thier suicide, Digvijay Singh (Cong) accused the government of being insensitive to plight of the agriculturists.He referred to the police firing on a violent agitation by farmers in Madhya Pradesh recently and said the agriculturists faced bullets on the centenary of Champaran agitation in which Mahatma Gandhi had raised his voice against British exploitation.He termed the imposition of import-export duties on foodgrains as one of the biggest scams.He said despite the bumper crop, import duty on wheat was reduced initially to 10 per cent from 25 per cent and then to zero in December, impacting farmers adversely as imported wheat was avaiable at cheaper prices.Foodgrain imports, which stood at Rs 134 crore in 2014-15, have risen to Rs 9,009 crore now, he said.Singh alleged that it was the wrong import-export policies which had led to imports of Rs 1,40,268 crore in 2015-16 as against Rs 56,000 crore in 2011-12.Quoting agriculture scientist MS Swaminathan to say that import of agricultural commodities was like outsourcing farmers skill to outside, he said there was a need for fixing import-export levies by the Commerce Ministry in consultation with Agriculture Ministry.Expressing concern over 42 per cent rise in incidents of suicide in 2014-15 in the country, Singh said agriculture has been reduced to loss-making proposition despite it contributing about 17 per cent to the GDP.He also alleged that there was corruption in Food Corporation of India (FCI) and National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED).The Congress leader alleged that after demonetisation, it was restrictions on cattle sale that had hit the farmers.He quoted Savarkar as saying that he was against ban on cow slaughter.Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Singh said that others in the Cabinet were helpless as it was PM who decided everything.He alleged that the crop insurance policy was nothing but a way to benefit industrialists.Minister of State for Agriculture Parshottam Rupala, who spoke in the capacity of a BJP member, said it was the Congress partys rule of 60 years which had resulted in the miserable condition of the farmers.There should be a discussion on the policies of previous governments and what all they did for farm sector, he said.He said the Modi government had taken a number of steps for the betterment of the farmers.Listing out the schemes, he said Rs 50,000 crore has been allocated for PM Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY) and 22 schemes under the project have already seen the light of the day.Under the programme, plans for irrigation at district level have been formulated, Rupala said.Ram Gopal Yadav of Samajwadi Party said the farmers have been affected because of import of agri products, which he alleged was being allowed because of ulterior motives while farmers are being deprived of remunerative prices.The prices of many agri-items have fallen below the minium support prices and, in some crops, it is not enough to meet even the transportation cost, he said.Citing the example of tomato prices that have risen sharply to about Rs 100 per kg, he said the prices are low when crops are harvested, but these rise after farmers sell their produce in the market.He said the futures market was also responsible for the farmers plight.Yadav said the agri growth has largely been below 4 per cent in last 25-30 years and that the farmers economic condition would not improve unless there is a sustainable growth in the sector.Yadav said the government has put tractors and pump sets in higher tax rate under the new GST regime and demanded that these items should be exempted from GST.Food processing in the country is in such a bad shape that every year fruits and vegetables worth Rs 50,000 crore to Rs 60,000 crore rot in the country, he said.Food processing percentage in India is barely 4 per cent as compared to 80 per cent in nations like Brazil, he added.He wanted to know under what circumstances private companies were roped in crop insurance scheme which was handled by the government companies earlier.He also wondered as to why the government could not use technology so that Indian apples could also last more unlike those imported from the US.Prasanna Acharya (BJD) sought to know from the government why farmers are committing suicide and are protesting on streets if the agriculture growth was high.He said farmers are not getting returns for their produce and are being cheated, not by Monsoon but by the government. Demonetisation has further aggravated their woes, he added.While the new crop insurance policy is better than the previous ones, it is benefitting private insurers more, he said.He said the Centre and states should take steps to fulfill three main demands of farmers  price, pension and prestige.Munquad Ali (BSP) said farmers situation is very bad in the country and that there has been a rise in farmers suicides in the last three years.Why it is happening? Why the government is not finding solution farmers problems? .I request the government not to give false promises. Please work for the welfare of farmers, he said.Praful Patel of NCP pitched for modern farm technologies like genetically modified crops to boost farm income,.It is unfortunate. I am sorry to say that we have neglected science and technology. There may be different views on BT technology but we have data how it benefits. We need to take benefit of it, he said.Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh has always focused on indigenous (technologies) but there is a need to use modern technology to improve farmers income, he said and suggested the minister to keep open mind on the issue of technology.Patel also spoke about shortcomings in the new crop insurance scheme and suggested the government to keep a watch on private insurers who are implementing it.Vijaysai Reddy (YSRCP) said the government needs to introspect why 12,000 farmers are committing suicides every year despite the government coming out with new schemes.He demanded that the loan waiver announced in some states need to be implemented in letter and spirite, claims under new crop insurance scheme should be settled in 15 days, better credit facility and creation of special agri-zones for farmers for better realisation.R S Bharathi (DMK) attacked the Prime Minister for not meeting the protesting Tamil Nadu farmers in Delhi and demanded a special session of Parliament to discuss the farmers issue and a special law to address their woes.Rajani Patil (Cong) said, I dont think the number (of farmers suicides will come down if the government does not take steps.She attacked Modi for not visiting affected farmers in Maharashtra, saying the prime minister has time to travel around the globe but no time for farmers in the state.Turning to Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh, she said the farmers situation is very serious. We dont want to hear about schemes in your reply. Tell me what relief you can give to our farmers. We want full loan waiver.Prabhat Jha (BJP) rejected allegation that the government was insensitive towards farmers plight and said maximum decisions had been taken over the last three years in the interest of farmers.He listed a slew of measures underaken like raising minimum support price for agriculture produce like wheat, rice, pulses and oilseeds.He said it was due to initiatives of the government that there was a record production of foodgrains in the country in 2016-17 at 271.98 million tonne (MT) including 108.8 MT rice and 96.64 MT of wheat besides 22.14 MT of pulses and 33.60 MT of oilseeds.On police firing during farmers agitation in Madhya Pradesh recently, Jha asked the opposition not to link such incidents to politics.He reminded the Congress that 24 farmers had been killed in firing in Madhya Pradesh in 1998 when Digvijay Singh was the Chief Minister and said nobody linked it to politics.D Raja of CPI said the whole country is witnessing suffering of farmers and asked the central government to consider debt waiver which has been done by various states.Farmers committing suicides should be unacceptable to us, Raja said and questioned why various commission reports on agriculture were not being implemented by the government.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

In addition, the NGO claimed, ghee, coconut, cashew and raisins were of poor quality.The NGO sampled 1,143 food items in the May-June period, and found 983 samples adulterated. Whats worse salt used for preparing food didnt contain iodine, said an NGO official.The findings found an overall adulteration of 86% of the total samples collected for tests. Eighty-one percent of salt samples did not have iodine. Mustard oil and vermillion were found adulterated. Some common items used to cook noodles such as chilli sauce, tomato sauce and vinegar were found unfit for consumption.Not only food, even prasad offered to the deities is of poor quality. Consumption of the food served to the people on yatra could mean a serious threat to life. Salt, an important ingredient was, found without iodine...which is dangerous, SPECS secretary Brijmohan Sharma said at a conference after releasing the findings on Wednesday.In the first 10 days, 2.21 lakh pilgrims paid obeisance at Badrinath and Kedarnath. Some 15 lakh pilgrims visited the four shrines within two months after the pilgrimage season began on April 27.Food Safety and Standards Authority (FSSA) additional commissioner Pankaj Pandey rejected the findings of the NGO. If the findings are genuine, then why dont they share statistics with the government? We dont claim that there is no adulteration along the route, but the report is exaggerated, he told Hindustan Times.Secretary, tourism, R Meenakshi Sundaram came out in support of Pandey.

The price is expected to further go up in the next couple of weeks, even touching Rs. 100 in the open market.During the last one week, the arrivals to the market remained fluctuating, but tending to be on the downward side. On Tuesday, the market received stocks to the tune of 293 metric tonnes, while it was 317 MT on Monday. In July 2016, the arrival was registered at 600 tonnes per day.Now, half of the produce with first quality grade was exported to Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and New Delhi. The second variety was sold in the wholesale at Rs. 41 per kg, which in turn was priced at Rs. 60-80 in the regular vegetable markets. The price is expected to go up in the next couple of weeks, even touching Rs. 100 in the open market.Farmers at the Madanapalle market had thrown away the produce in hundreds of tonnes daily when the price suddenly fell to Rs. 1 per kg in June 2015. Two years since the event, they have reason to smile. About 10,000 farmers depend on tomato crop in the western mandals, covering an acreage of about 30,000 hectares.Deputy Director (Horticulture) Saraswathi told The Hindu that in February harvesting of the major part of the crop was done and there was a slump in the later months.The crop suffered substantial damage in April and May due to sudden rains in the western mandals. Though tomato farming is done in Madanapalle division throughout the year, this year, there prevailed a gap between February and June, the official said. Agriculture Market Committee (AMC-Madanapalle) chairman Ratakonda Gurappa Naidu, an authority on tomato trading in the region since three decades, said for the first time the farmers were educated about the need for sustained farming, covering round the year. In the previous seasons, a farmer used to go in for tomato crop all over the field simultaneously. This used to result in bumper crop, resulting in no demand and plummeting prices. This crop year, the farmers divided the crop pattern into three categories.Each farmer maintained three slots of farming, avoiding bumper crops. The even distribution has led to a drastic fall in production, but it protected the economic interests of the farmers with healthy demand and moderate supply.Another reason for happiness of the domestic farmer here is that tomato growing has been halted in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh with the advent of summer, facilitating our farmers to export their produce to northern parts, Mr. Naidu said.Meanwhile, the retail prices at the vegetable markets became a cause of big worry to the households. In Chittoor, the second quality produce was sold at Rs. 70-80 on Tuesday, and it was the same throughout the district. In Srikalahasti, the supply was truncated, and the households virtually went hunting for the red gold."

A week before, tomatoes were priced at Rs. 36 and chillies at Rs. 26 a kg.Attributing the surge in prices of vegetables to unfavourable climatic condition and frequent showers, farmers say the annual harvest has been adversely affected. This year, rain washed away most part of tomato crop cultivated on a two-acre field in my farm in Sabbavaram mandal. Normally, the seasonal crop fetches good margins but this time I have to grapple with the failed harvest, rues P. Appala Naidu, tomato-grower.While tomato producers from Ramabhadrapuram, Sabbavaram, K. Kotapadu and Pendurthi mandals bear the brunt of the crop failure, wholesale traders cite short supply from vegetable-growing regions as reason for increase in tomato price. The supply from main tomato-growing regions such as Kolar, Narayangaon, Bengaluru, Guntur, Anantapur and Madanapalle has come down drastically. With a huge variation between the demand and supply, the prices of tomatoes have eventually increased, A. Narayana Murthy, wholesale trader, says.Rythu bazaars in MVP Colony, Seethammadhara and Gopalapatnam receive about 50 to 80 quintals of tomatoes a day, whereas the ones at Narasimha Nagar, Kancharapalem, Peda Waltair and Madhurawada get 20-40 quintals.In addition to tomatoes and green chillies, prices of leafy vegetables have almost doubled in the past 10 days. A small bunch of coriander leaves costs Rs. .10-Rs. 20.According to estate officer of MVP Rythu Bazaar K. Varahalu, the cost of tomatoes and green chillies will continue to remain high for the next few days."

A scene from the Ernakulam market on Tuesday.Thulasi KakkatThere seems to be no respite to the common man as vegetable prices in the district continue to remain largely high, with tomato, onion and carrot being especially costly.At the Ernakulam market, small onion was sold at a wholesale price of Rs. 90 per kg and a retail price of Rs. 100 whereas tomato and carrot were sold at Rs. 52 and Rs. 60 and Rs. 55 and Rs. 60 respectively. Prices were even higher in some other markets.On an average, vegetable prices continue to be 20 per higher than what it was a month ago, though prices of some vegetables have dropped slightly, said K.K. Ashraf, vice-president, Ernakulam Market Stall Owners Association.Price of shallotsThe only relief seems to be the declining trend in the price of shallots after touching a high of Rs. 130 recently, though the ruling retail price of Rs. 100 per kg is a far cry from Rs. 65 in April. Mr. Ashraf expressed the hope that a further softening of onion prices would come about with production catching up in Tamil Nadu, the main supplier to Kerala.However, tomato and carrot prices continued to hold firm with the previous low of Rs. 20 per kg appearing to be from a distant past. Green chilli has also turned a lot spicier with the price soaring to Rs. 60 per kg from Rs. 35.The shortage of tomatoes in North India drove traders from there to the markets in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which in turn, took a toll on the supply to Kerala. The strike by farmers in Maharashtra didnt help either, Mr. Ashraf said.In the meantime, the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) which aims at ensuring fair prices for farmers, was on a high over what it claimed consistently good returns for farmers. Farmers continue to auction their crops through 22 farmer markets in the district.Data collected from the wholesale markets in Aluva, Ernakulam and Perumbavoor on a daily basis by the market information centre of the VFPRCK were handed over to farmers to be used as the base price in auctioning their produce.This ensured that farmers got a price, which was even better than the market price, a senior VFPCK official said.Asked whether better price for farmers automatically resulted in higher prices for consumers, the official said that it was beyond the mandate of the VFPCK and had to be addressed by the government through market intervention measures."

Farmers in Madhya Pradeshs Neemuch-Mandsaur belt are feeling cheated as well. Just two months ago they were facing police bullets for demanding better prices for their bumper crop of onions, which they had to dump by the truckloads on the streets.In January-February, the same region had seen protests over a tomato glut, with prices crashing to as low as Rs 2 per kg. The subsequent onion bumper crop dragged its price to Rs 2 a kilogram, forcing many farmers to let their produce rot in the fields.We have noticed that whenever farmers have perishable items with them, the prices are in the dumps, and the moment it goes into the hands of traders, there is a massive price spike, says Bhupendra Patidar, a farmer from Barbariya village in Neemuch district.Six farmers were killed in clashes with police in the Neemuch-Mandsaur region in the first week of June, leading to protests across the state and a demand for government assured minimum price at local markets. The protests forced the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government to procure onions at Rs 8 per kg.Two months down the line, when the farmers have nothing to sell and are busy sowing for the next season, the prices of most agriculture products have shot up.In May, the average price of tomatoes in Mandsaurs wholesale market was Rs 500-700 per quintal. In August first week, it touched Rs 4,500. Similarly, the price of onions almost doubled from Rs 400 to Rs 800 per quintal during the same period.Skyrocketing prices Average price of onion and tomato has been witnessing a sharp spike across the country over past few months Average price of onion and tomato has been witnessing a sharp spike across the country over past few monthsWith local traders adding their profit margin, tomatoes are retailing at Rs 100 or more per kg in most parts of the country. The retail price of onion has crossed Rs 30 per kg, with a further spike expected till the fresh produce lands in September.Small and marginal farmers who constitute 85% of the farming community rarely get the benefit of high prices. The reason being they dont have storage facilities to take benefit of the price fluctuation, says Patidar, who witnessed the dumping of unsold onions and tomatoes by the roadside this year.After last years losses, like most farmers, we did not grow tomatoes this season. But now the prices are sky high and only the traders have it, says Jaswant Carpenter of Pipliyamandi, the epicentre of the farmers protest in Mandsaur.Traders, however, blame low production for tomato prices sky-rocketing.There is less production this year and therefore low supply. Most of it is in the hands of the big traders who are releasing it slowly from the cold storage so that the prices do not come down, says a government official in Indore, not wanting to be named.Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh president Shiv Kumar Sharma blames the government for the price fluctuations. In the last 14 years, the government has failed to increase storage capacity for onions or tomatoes as a result of which vegetables rot during bumper production and only traders benefit by hoarding it.Given the current spate of rains and floods, traders see no relief in sight due to supply disruption which is likely to continue till August-end. In fact, prices of other vegetables such as brinjal and cabbage will also rise due to reduced supply as the summer vegetable season comes to an end.(With inputs from Mustafa Hussain)"

The heat and lack of water have led to a fall in production. If the market received 10 loads earlier, now it gets two-three loads a day, he says.Tomato prices in Chala vary from Rs. 60 to Rs. 70 a kg when it normally costs Rs. 20 a kg or less.A 28-kg box of tomatoes cost Rs. 1,600, says an employee at a wholesale dealer in the market. Factoring in loss owing to spoilage, tomatoes have to be sold at Rs. 65 a kg, he says.However, a retailer at Sreevarahom says he buys tomatoes at Rs. 1,400 a box.A vegetable seller at Vallakadavu says he purchases tomatoes from Chala at Rs. 60 a kg and sells them at Rs. 70 a kg. A box that usually costs up to Rs. 500 a kg cost me Rs. 1,400 today. On Monday, it was Rs. 1,300 a box.It is not just tomatoes that have homamakers groaning. The price of ladys finger too has shot up to Rs. 60-65 a kg from Rs. 22-30 a kg.Retailers say they cant increase the price of tomatoes beyond a point as stock will go unsold, and tomatoes get spoilt fast. People know what the price in Chala is. I can sell tomatoes only if the increase is reasonable. Ladys finger can be sold for Rs. 80 a kg but not tomatoes, says a retailer.If stock remains unsold, they purchase less from Chala the next day.Carrot and beans continue to be expensive.

The price has skyrocketed compared to last week, making it one of the costliest vegetables this week.According to traders, the steep rise in the price is due to decline in supply to the market in the city. The increase in price of this staple vegetable is making purchase of vegetables an expensive exercise.As A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam, explained, There is no production of tomatoes in Tamil Nadu as of now, and we are relying only on supply from Andhra Pradesh. As tomatoes are being supplied from AP to all places, the supply is dwindling, resulting in the rise in rates.On Tuesday, a kg of tomato was priced between Rs. Rs. 50 and Rs. 60 in the retail market, but each shop fixed its own rate. The price has been steadily rising in the last 10 days by Rs. five to Rs. 10. Last week, the price of one kg of tomato was between Rs. 30 and Rs. 40, he said.Last month, tomatoes were sold at Rs. 15 to Rs. 20 a kg, he added. A retail vendor in Sathuvachari said the rates had shot up especially in the last three or four days. A box of tomatoes comprising 25 kg was earlier priced at Rs. 600. Now, it costs between Rs. 1,300 and Rs. 1,400.Brinjal too is costlyAnother vegetable that has turned pricier is the thorny variety of brinjal. The rates have almost doubled when compared to a few weeks ago. A kilogram of brinjal costs between Rs. 60 and Rs. 80 now. There is no water for crops, and there is also pest attack due to heat conditions. Hence, the yield is less, Mr. Balu added."

There is no definite cause for the increase, with middlemen at Vashi APMC blaming ambiguous causesfrom November's demonetisation to the farmers' strike in June as well as ""inclement weather"".Contrary to traders' claims there is no visible shortage either. Good quality, robust red tomatoes are available at all markets in Mumbai. Curiously, retail rates are rising even as wholesale rates continue to fall.APMC trader Shyam Yadav said, ""Wholesale rates rose to Rs 55-60 per kg over Friday-Saturday. On Monday, they dropped to Rs 36-40. Let us see what happens tomorrow.""Conversely, retail rates were Rs 35-40 per kg over Friday-Saturday, perhaps due to leftover stocks, which spiralled to Rs 60-80 Monday as retailers charged their pound of flesh. ""I bought half a kilo for Rs 30 to tide over the next two days. But how long can we continue like this?"" said Andheri resident Shaila Grover.Tomato is a household staple without which no meal is complete. Moreover, Shravan observances are set to begin on July 10 for north Indian communities and July 24 for Maharashtrians and Gujaratis. During this time families avoid onion and garlic and rely on tomato.One of the largest middlemen in the tomato trade at APMC Vashi, Javed Memon, cited a slew of reasons which seemed tough to swallow. ""This price increase is an outcome of notebandi. Recently there was also the farmers' strike in Maharashtra. Moreover, I am told the seeds have failed in south India. So this season we are relying on tomatoes from Maharashtra where a heat wave has beset certain growing areas. Also, remember that farmers have not been getting a good rate for their produce since the past year and a half. It is time they made some money.""Asked when customers would get relief, Memon said, ""Don't think of customers. Why think of customers alone, think of the farmer as well."" TOI asked if farmers were getting good rates at present. ""Well, not to their satisfaction. After all, the quality of their tomatoes is poor,"" the middleman said, adding prices would remain high till end-August.Mumbai receives its quota of tomato from cultivated areas in Karnataka, as well as Satara, Sangli and Narayangaon in Pune."

Small farmers said some vegetables get them good price. But they fear the prices may come down as the harvesting starts.Shankar Chavan, a farmer and vegetable vendor at Kapiltirth Market, said, ""The farmers come from long distances. Since the transport services get slowed down during heavy rains, which are occurring in most parts of the district, the supply of vegetables comes down. For instance, the demand for green chillies is comparatively less now, but the prices have gone up from Rs 60 per kg to Rs 80 per kg.""The traders at the APMC here said the heavy rains in villages damage the harvested produce. A couple of weeks ago, the supply of tomatoes was around 2,000 crates every day; but, it came down to 700 crates on Monday. The retail prices of tomatoes, one of the most perishable produces, rose to Rs 21 per kg in from Rs 9 per kg a couple of weeks ago.The district is not self-sufficient as far as vegetables are concerned as the area under vegetable cultivation is small.

""We were eating lots of salad for the past few months. But with prices of cucumber, tomato and coriander rising significantly, we had to remove salad from our menu,"" said homemaker Yadav.According to traders, prices rose mainly due to contraction in supply of vegetables after the rains.

The Centre has decided to construct 500 cold storage chains across India.Union minister of agriculture Radha Mohan Singh, who was in Gandhinagar to attend the Textile India-2017 exhibition told TOI that these cold storage chains would be useful in helping farmers get better price for the produce and thereby increase their income.Regarding Gujarat farmers demanding a minimum support price for potato, tomato and onions, Singh said that the country already has a list of crops for which minimum support price has been announced. ""But currently there is no plan to upgrade the list or include vegetables in this list,"" Singh said.When told that farmers in Gujarat were throwing their produce away because of low support prices, Singh said that they should use cold storage facilities.Speaking at the seminar on 'Productivity and Product Diversification Challenges for Natural Fibres,' Singh said that natural fibres are the backbone of Indian textile industry. He said that despite stiff competition from synthetic fibres, the demand for natural fibres was steadily increasing with a growing population.The minister further said that given the limitation in increasing area under cultivation, the only way to improve production is increasing productivity. He said that introduction of high-yielding varieties, best agronomical practices, efficient fibre extractors and effective utilization for diversified products will improve productivity. Cotton is produced in over 90 countries across the world, and over 60% of that production comes from India, Singh said.Union textile minister Smriti Irani said the textile ministry and agriculture ministry have decided that the two ministries will have a regular exchange of information, knowledge and feedback on best practices . She said textiles is one of India's leading industries and has the potential to generate employment for millions of people throughout the country. The knowledge sharing will be in local languages so that farmers get the information and are not left out because the information was not a language they did not understand."

While retailers do not link the increase with GST, they feel an apprehension of overall increase in prices in the new tax regime has prompted middlemen to jack up prices. They have also cited less buying by retailers during rainy season as another reason for supply shortage in local markets.In retail markets , increase in average prices is ranging between Rs 10 and Rs 15 per kg. So far, the worst hit has been tomato which has seen a decline in supply and a sharp rise in prices. During the past fortnight, tomato price has increased by around Rs 15 per kg. ""We sold tomato at Rs 40-45 per kg even two weeks back. Now it is being sold at Rs 60 per kg. We are told that there has been a dip in supply of the Bengaluru crop,"" said Gopal Kundu, a vegetable retailer at Lake Market. Tomato prices have actually shown a sharp rise across the country in the past 10 days following crop damage due to rain in tomato-producing states like Haryana.""We receive the bulk of tomato from Maharashtra. But supplies have gone down substantially in the past few weeks. This has created a supply shortage in the wholesale market. As a result, prices of tomato has almost doubled in the past week,"" said Uttam Mukherjee, chief supervisor of Koley market.Other vegetables, including striped gourd (parwal), ladies finger (bhindi), brinjal and onion, have also recorded increase in prices at city markets. ""At Maniktala market, prices of vegetables like striped gourd, ladies finger and brinjal have increased by around Rs 10 per kg in past two weeks. So far, there has not been any report of crop damage from rain in neighbouring districts. But, price is still rising,"" said Kartik Saha, a vegetable vendor at Maniktala market.""Government has said there won't be any impact of GST on vegetables. But we have seen a steady rise in prices in past two weeks, especially after the Eid. It seems the middlemen are taking advantage of fears over the new tax regime,"" Kundu said."

The farmers sold potatoes for as low as nine paisa per kg in Kurukshetra and were forced to feed tomatoes to their cattle as they did not get the right price, he said.The former CM said both the farmers and the consumers had suffered as the fall in prices of agricultural products had not reflected in the prices of the end-products.He said the prices of wheat, potatoes and tomatoes had nose-dived, but there was no change in the prices of flour, chips and the sauce, adding that the farmer was silent but not dumb."

Basavarajus produce was bought by a trader from Kerala. He described the price as highest in this season.Basavaraju attributed the sudden rise in the cost caused by a fall in production to declining water reserves (short-duration crops not getting sufficient water) and the demand for the fruit in neighbouring States, mainly from Kerala and Tamil Nadu.Basavaraju, who had grown tomatoes on a small portion of his land at Kalkunda, had so far harvested 200 crates and expects 50 more crates in the next few days. I go to markets where I get a good price. I have also sold tomato in Bengaluru and Hassan markets, said the farmer, who also grows vegetables on his 7-acre plot.Like Basavaraju, tomato growers, who had brought their produce to the APMC here, said they had grown the fruit with borewell water.

Out of a 25 kg box, 2 kg would have rotten during the transportation period. Traders will have to make profit with the remaining 23 kg of tomato, said an official of Uzhavar Sandhai.Since the price was high, customers shied away from buying tomatoes. Though tomato is an important commodity for cooking, not many customers prefer to buy one kg of tomato at Rs. 100. They manage the situation by limiting their purchase to 200-300 grams, said G. Manikandan, a retail grocery trader at Cantonment.Traders attribute the high price to the dwindling arrival from Andhra Pradesh, Krishnagiri, Theni and Oddanchathiram.

According to an official, traders from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are purchasing the product in Karnataka.In May, tomato cultivators in Kolar were dumping their crop by the roadside as prices had crashed to as low as Rs. 2 a kg in the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) yard. This month, however, the tide has turned. Rates have doubled and, in some cases, increased four times since June. Kolar district is one of the biggest producers of tomato in Karnataka.The reason for this change in narrative is a massive loss of the crop in some of the major tomato growing States in the country.Huge damage to crops, particularly in Nashik in Maharashtra, is the main reason for increase in demand from Kolar. Plus, damage to crop due to diseases and pests in non-traditional areas such as Mandya has added to the scarcity, said M.S. Raju, Deputy Director, Horticulture Department.According to A. Vishwanath, an APMC official, traders from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are purchasing the product in Karnataka. Another APMC source said that there has been interest even from Punjab. On June 4, a quintal was being sold at the APMC for a minimum of Rs. 314 and a maximum of Rs. 1,400 depending on quality and variety. On July 4, the price range was from Rs. 667 to Rs. 5,334 a quintal. On Wednesday morning, the average rate was around Rs. 5,000.In the retail market, consumers were paying Rs. 10 per kg a month ago. Now, they have to shell out as much as Rs. 50.Search for alternativesA reduction in supply from other States and districts combined with the produce from Kolar being shipped out of Karnataka has led to a scarcity and a steep hike in prices in the local market.This has led to experimenting with other local products.

Fall in production in neighbouring States owing to climatic factors has led to an increase in prices of many vegetables.Tomato and okra are among the vegetables that have shown a significant increase in recent days. In Chala, tomato costs between Rs. 60 to Rs. 70 a kg, but retail prices elsewhere in the city go up to Rs. 80 a kg.Shallots continue to make homemakers shed tears, with prices ranging from Rs. 80 a kg for wholesale to Rs. 140 in retail shops for the best quality.SeasonalSays a commission agent at Chala: Prices are on the rise owing to a drop in production. This is seasonal. Take onion for instance. As onion prices are low in producer States following bumper production, not many farmers will be inclined to grow onion. Those who do will get a good price next year as prices will increase when supply dwindles. This is also the case with shallots. With less stock availability, prices are bound to shoot up. However, there has been a dip in wholesale prices of shallots, he points out. Though shallots havent been reaching the market from Tamil Nadu, an improvement in climate in the crop-growing areas in Karnataka holds out some hope for a further reduction in prices.Yet there are vegetables such as thadiyan kaya which cost Rs. 35 a kg now. I dont remember it exceeding Rs. 20 a kg in recent times, he says.Another wholesale agent says that following a shortfall in tomato production in some States, traders from there reached Karnataka markets, affecting the supply to Kerala. The prices have shot up this much within a fortnight, says a retail vegetable seller.While cowpea (payar) is available for Rs. 40 a kg at Chala, the nadan variety costs Rs. 90-100.Green chilli has not lost its bite either, with prices hovering around Rs. 60 a kg for wholesale and Rs. 70 for retail.Carrot cost around Rs. 60, though cheaper ones can be had for Rs. 45 a kg, says an agent for a farmers producer company. There are three to four types of carrots and beans available, and prices vary for each. Carrot, from Rs. 54 the day before, has increased to Rs. 62. Beans is priced at Rs. 62.Daily fluctuations too have a role to play, and over the course of a week, prices may show a substantial increase or decrease. For instance, okra that cost Rs. 57 a kg a week ago has dipped to Rs. 36 for wholesale and Rs. 40 for retail. Drumstick price too has come down to Rs. 50 a kg. Indian cucumber though is expensive.One retailer at Chala says good quality carrots are available for less than Rs. 50 a kg. But okra in his shop costs Rs. 50 a kg, though it used to cost less than Rs. 20 a kg a month ago.QualityA couple of retailers say they stock the best quality and hence prices are on the higher side for their veggies. Yet, this argument does not go down well with customers who complain of being fleeced.Price intervention, however, does not work much, say the traders.Prices of vegetables that are expensive now will come down in a month or so, some say. Yet others think the trend will continue till Chingam."

Over watering can rot the plantJoin social media groups on organic terrace gardening for expert helpOf late Bengalureans have taken the saying 'Grow what you eat, Eat what you grow' quite seriously. Many in the city are now growing their own veggies and fruits in the tiniest space they find and do not shy from showing off their bounty. However, in this growing group of organic terrace gardeners, there are youngsters who manage to strike a balance between their studies and their hobby.For 14-year-old Niranjan Girish, it was his grandmother who inspired him to take to gardening. Niranjan says, ""When I was young, I used to go to Chennai to visit my grandmother and I used to see her work in her garden. She used to grow several vegetables. That is when I began helping her out and grew a fondness for gardening."" The ninth grader's vegetable garden in his house boasts of pomogranate, brinjal, strawberry, orange, potato, carrots and several other plants. Sixteen-year-old Arya Pudota too began growing vegetables and fruits at a young age. Arya, who has been actively involved in organic kitchen gardening, took after his mother, who had brought a piece of land next to their home with the intention of having a kitchen garden. He now grows several vegetables such as coriander, spinach, ladyfingers, beans, tomatoes, brinjal and more, most of which are consumed at home, he says adding that the family tries to limit their vegetable and fruit purchase from the market to a bare minimum.Having a garden in the city is a tough task, given the space crunch. But these gardeners have managed to have their own green patch by utilizing every little space they get. Apart from the space, sourcing seeds and saplings has been a worry for them. Kiran Pattar, another young terrace gardener and an entrepreneur from the city says that initially, even he had problems while sourcing seeds. ""I have been growing vegetables and fruits since I was a kid. Back in those days sourcing seeds was a problem. I had to go and approach farmers for saplings or seeds,"" he says adding that now things are better, given that several ecommerce companies sell all the gardening necessities.Though there haven't been any problems, sometimes the yield is not as expected, says Arya. ""We realized that once our vegetables were not growing as they were supposed to. So we took the help of an expert, who said that there was zinc deficiency in the soil. Following that, we added organic supplements in the soil,"" he says.Arya, who has conducted sapling drives in the past, says that he has received immense support from his school. ""I have also created the first recreational garden and given away saplings to teachers as part of gardening drives in my school and try to ensure that there are regular activities conducted that encourage students to take part in gardening,"" he says. In addition to this, schools in the city are now introducing gardening as part of the curriculum, encouraging students to take up organic gardening. BM English School on Hennur- Bagalur Road, is one such school that has introduced gardening as one of the subjects from first grade. ""We have introduced gardening from first grade onwards where each class is given a soil bed where they can grow their own vegetables. In addition to this, they are also taught waste management and composting. From sixth grade onwards, the classes are given a bigger patch of land,"" says S Rajesh, Principal, BM English School.How comfortable are the parents with the inclusion of such a subject in the syllabus, we ask. ""Initially we were skeptical of introducing gardening as a subject as parents would think that it would eat into their regular subjects, but after they saw how beneficial it would be for their kids, they supported us in this initiative,"" he says adding that now the students don't mind getting their hands dirty in mud.Kiran adds that in addition to the parents, schools must also encourage students to take up organic terrace gardening. ""If schools introduce it in their curriculum, it will be easier for the parents to understand and support their children in this initiative,"" he says stressing that people should start organic gardening not because it is a trend but to make it a part of their lifestyle."

Retail traders in smaller markets have a reason to rejoice since more customers are visiting their shops.When contacted, Rythu Bazar officials said, The market procures vegetables from neighbouring villages in Krishna and Guntur district on a daily basis as those areas have seen bumper productions. They claimed that vegetable farmers would not suffer much loss as vegetable crops are harvested in phases. After a fortnight, the prices would stabilise bringing much needed relief to the growers."

The supply of tomatoes from Karnataka to Yemmiganur in Kurnool district has nosedived.The short supply, thanks to decreased rainfall, resulted in the escalation of price by 150 per cent  `100 per kg  in Kurnool. V Hanumantha Rao Chowdary, a wholesaler dealer in the main market of the district head quarters, said there was a sharp fall in sales. The cost of vegetables has gone up, particularly that of tomatoes. This has resulted in a decrease in the number of buyers, with even regular customers reducing their consumption. Leftover stock will only increase our losses, he feared.Meanwhile, the rise in price is catching up in other parts of the state too. The going rate of tomatoes in Vijayawada is now `55/kg, a steep rise compared to last month's `20/kg. Officials pin the blame on the decrease in production. The usual non-remunerative price of the vegetable had forced farmers to turn to the cultivation of other crops. An estate officer at a rythu bazaar said only 15 tonnes, half of the usual stock of tomatoes, arrived on Saturday."

The programme, under National Horticulture Mission, is aimed at expanding the coverage to 11,250 acres in 22 districts, including Cauvery delta region that is reeling under a water crisis.Making a suo motu announcement under Rule 110, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami said the move was to avail less quantum of water and give high yield to generate more income for farmers. ""In the current fiscal year, the plan is to help 2,250 farmers. Hybrid seeds and raised seedlings will be distributed to farmers at a 50% subsidy of Rs 8,000 per acre,"" he said. Other than the traditional western belt of horticulture like Krishnagiri and Ariyalur, the government plans to bring in more areas under the scheme to benefit the larger population.While Tamil Nadu produces 77.72 lakh metric tonnes of vegetables annually, the area under vegetable cultivation will be increased to 3.37 lakh hectares from the present 3.14 lakh hectares. Hybrid vegetable cultivation is promoted by providing assistance to cultivation, and the special focus is given to preserve traditional vegetables. ""Predominantly, tomatoes, brinjal, and chillies are the major crop seedlings given to farmers. We motivate them to expand the areas by availing the subsidized seedlings,"" said a senior government official. Hybrid vegetable protray seedlings are raised in state horticulture farmers.Palaniswami announced a scheme to promote solar energy in agriculture. At least 1,000 farmers will get fixed type solar powered pumping systems with 90% subsidy assistance from the state and Centre. ""This comes in the wake of huge demand from the farmers, especially in the delta region. The pump sets come in the range of 5HP to 10HP and the programme is being implemented successfully for the last four years,"" the official said. Only 203 solar powered pump sets were extended to the farmers last year, with 80% subsidy.The state has also planned to set up 597 'pack' houses to add value to the horticulture produce in districts. Similarly, 160 sub-agricultural extension centres will be built, in addition to 146 centres coming up in block level to help farmers get the services of agriculture department, including seeds and micro-nutrients.The chief minister said the Centre of Excellence for Bio-Technology will be established in the Tamil Nadu Agriculture University in Coimbatore at an estimated cost of Rs 430 crore, with the preliminary sanction of Rs 51 crore this fiscal year. Adequate infrastructure facilities will be provided in agriculture institutions across the state at a cost of Rs 108 crore."

For, after sliding down from as high as Rs 70 per kg in the beginning of July, tomatoes are back to turning people red with anger at having to shell out anywhere between Rs 70 and Rs 100 per kg.One kg of tomatoes, which was priced at Rs 38 in the state-run Rythu Bazaar last Tuesday, was back to reigning at Rs 70 per kg this Tuesday.Confirming that prices have been spiraling out of control, the state agriculture department authorities said that it is highly unlikely that the situation will improve anytime soon because of a shortfall in tomato cultivation in the state.Explaining the reason for fluctuating prices, B Babu, an officer of the department, said that after the initial price rise in the beginning of July (as heavy rainfall left standing crop damaged), the authorities began importing tomatoes from neighbouring states, bringing down prices for a while.""Farmers in the state did not take up vegetable farming completely . If they had one acre of land, they only planted vegetables on one-fourth of it,"" said Babu, adding that only 65 % of the total area under vegetable cultivation in the state was planted this year.Farmers are reportedly taking up partial planting to avoid facing losses due to na tural reasons, like last year's flooding or the drought-like situation that was prevalent over the state in the couple of years before that.""Farmers say that they are not able to make any profits as their produce is being taken away by middle-men, who take the produce into the city markets. If this is the case, there is bound to be gaps in the demand and supply of vegetables in the city,"" said Naveen Ramsetty, state committee member, Rythu Swarajya Vedika.The city, he said, procures nearly 90% of its vegetables from two places, Kurnool and Madanapally village in Chittoor district."

Prices may increase as demand rises.Prices of several other vegetables have touched Rs 100 per kg or are nearing that mark.Brinjal's price has crossed Rs 50 per kg. Prices of ladyfingers, cluster beans, and green beans have gone past the Rs 50 per kg threshold in the retail market.""Prices of vegetables are skyrocketing because of heavy rains in the city,"" said Deepak Patel, the secretary of the APMC. ""Whenever there is a long spell of rain in the state, prices increase.""He said that prices usually stabilize when water recedes from fields.He said that the state was banking on tomatoes from Maharashtra and the south because rain has washed away around 25% of crops. But steady demand was increasing prices, he said.Sources in the APMC said that the demand for the tomatoes will increase as the shravan month begins in a week for North Indians, and by the end of the month for Gujaratis and Maharashtrians. During shravan, people avoid onion and garlic and hence the demand for tomatoes and other vegetables shoots up.It is worth recalling that farmers in the state did not receive good prices for their produce earlier this year; they were forced to throw away the produce on the roads. However, Radheshyam Marwadi, a trader in Memnagar , said that prices are likely to dip later this month. But they will increase again in August and September."

For ages, the Nepali-speaking population in the Hills have relied on a unique ""exchange plan"" of sorts to tide over tough times  when in need, people don't hesitate to approach their neighbours for cereals or flour, only to return the exact quantities when things improve. Now, they have moved a step ahead and turned to barter.Biju Rai, who runs a stationery shop near the old TV station in Darjeeling, had stacked four crates of biscuits along with other items two days before the strike. When the shutdown began, he had ample resources but hardly any vegetables or cash.""Biscuits have become extremely prized in these circumstances. So, I have started trading the biscuit packets for vegetables like tomatoes, watercress and pumpkin from a local vegetable seller, who grows vegetables in her own farm,"" Rai said.Another stationary shop owner in Chawkbazar, who requested anonymity, said locals regularly knock on his doors after dusk  his home is adjacent to the shop  to ask for daily requirements like salt, sugar and flour.""Over the past two days, people have started running short of cash. Yesterday, I gave away a kg of salt and sugar each to a local for four apples and six bananas. I think I made a good deal since fruits have disappeared from the market,"" he said.A woman who continues to sell momos, thukpas and homemade breadsticks near the Darjeeling Sadar Hospital as her establishment is out of the purview of the strike as she caters to patients and their relatives, said how an elderly woman came to her with an ailing grandson and little money to pay and offered her some beans, green chillies and bitter-gourd grown in her kitchen garden. ""I didn't take the vegetables though and told her to pay later for the food,"" she said.Liquor outlets in the Hills were shut down by the administration well before the indefinite bandh started as officials felt liquor could be used as a bait by Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) leaders to mobilise mobs. But the locals have found a way to procure liquor bottles from Sikkim or the plains and these are selling at a premium.""I had stacked a few bottles of liquor last week but had to trade a bottle of Old Monk rum for five litres of petrol from a pump owner who had no liquor stock. He has promised me more fuel if I can continue to supply liquor,"" said Prakash Thapa, who ran out of fuel for his bike.A regular face at the motor stand in Darjeeling, Ratna Maan, who sells milk and watercress said he is accepting nutrition bars and chocolates from those who don't have cash. ""I have brothers at home, who love chocolates and nutrition bars. Since, they are hard to find now, I accept them,"" he said.GJM leaders said they are aware of the barter system and called it a form of ""improvisation"" on the part of residents. ""Hills people are always ready to improvise. They are helping each other by exchanging goods of daily use. But they are also determined to continue with the strike and endure sufferings to attain the larger goal - Gorkhaland,"" said Kalyan Dewan, a senior GJM leader and convenor of Gorkhaland Movement Coordination Committee."

This staple item is selling for Rs 70-80 in most parts of the city as well as Thane and Navi Mumbai.Citizens have been tweeting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to take action. The holy month of Shravan began in north India on Monday. The fasting season according to the Maharashtrian and Gujarati calendar starts July 24. As families abstain from non-vegetarian food during this time, consumption of tomato rises.Traders have no explanation for the increase other than ""unseasonal rain"". They say the situation will continue through August. This is bewildering given that farmers were dumping produce in the streets as tomato rates crashed to Re 1 per kg a few weeks ago.In Andheri market, vendor Umar said, ""We are selling good quality fruit for Rs 100 because we are purchasing for Rs 75 in the wholesale market. This stock comes from Bangalore. The crop in Maharashtra has failed due to excessive rain."" Last week, the largest trader in APMC had cited a slew of reasons including ""demonetisation, farmers' strike and bad weather"".On Monday, buyers in Thane market, Bandra and Andheri restricted themselves to purchasing half a kg. Others chose to avoid tomato. ""The greengrocer cheekily asked me why I did not want to buy tomato since I had bought other vegetables. I retorted that at Rs 80 per kg, he was welcome to keep his produce,"" said Shiuli Banerjee of Malad.Kitchens are forced to explore alternatives. Borivli housewife Rosemary Fernandes recommended that households try vinegar while Maya Mirchandani of Andheri recommended thickening the gravy with sour curd or tamarind pulp. Banerjee suggested lime juice and kokum to add sourness, and gravies thickened with potato and cornflour to tide over the crisis.Prices of onion-tomato have maintained a steady average of Rs 15-20 per kg since 2014. In previous years, the country had seen a biannual spike in rates from March-May and October-December as traders cited ""seasonal shortages"" owing to the vagaries of monsoon. This inexplicable spike has brought consumers' worst fears back to haunt them."

Tomatoes and potatoes have been dumped on roads as agitations erupt for minimum support prices or loan waivers . But in the tribal hamlets of Chhota Udepur farmers have made unprecedented gains. Charoli and custard apples are bringing prosperity as farmers break free from treacherous traders' trap after centuriesBordha (Chhota Udepur): It's a dry fruit that costs not less than Rs 800 a kg; as much as cashews or almonds. But Ramesh Rathwa, a 48-year-old farmer in the remote Manka village of Chhota Udepur, never got cash for charoli, the crunchy almond-flavoured dry fruit that he collected from the forest near his hut. For all the hard work he and his wife put in from 3am to noon, they got just few pounds of grains that would last them barely a fortnight.Like Rathwa, several generations of farmers in this tribal heartland only got grains instead of money, thanks to the centuries-old saata (barter) system imposed upon them by local traders. They perennially kept these illiterate farmers in the dark about the actual value of charoli, which is widely used to add an extra crunch to sweets like kheer, mohan thaal, and basundi.But winds of change are sweeping through these far-flung villages of Chhota Udepur, the only district where charoli grows in Gujarat. Realizing the exploitation, the forest department took it upon itself to help them earn profit through an 'alternative livelihood through resource generation programme.'""We have been exploited for centuries. But three years ago, it was the first time I got Rs 7,000 cash profit for charoli,"" says Ramesh, who built a pucca house with an extra income of Rs 10,000 every year. SK Puwar, DCF, Chhota Udepur, said: ""We not only educated farmers about the value of this dry fruit but also helped them sell the produce at better rates by tying up with Reliance Fresh and other big retailers. The profits are shared with farmers.""A decortication machine of Rs four lakh was also set up in Bordha, which has now emerged as the local hub for this dry fruit, said Dipak Tank, district coordinator of the programme.""We were taught the scientific way of plucking which gave best quality seeds. Moreover, the decortication has made the tedious process of women every easy,"" said Kamlaben Rathwa, president of 11-member self-help group (SHG) in BordhaCharoli trees are spread in 836 hectares of forest in Bordha where the seeds are stored, weighed and collected by the forest department for sale. Charoli cluster includes seven villages: Manka, Bordha, Degla, Sajuli, Gabadiya, Gathiya and Runvad with every hamlet having a special team to ensure that charoli is not plucked illegally.Navsingh Rathwa, who heads the joint forest management committee (JFMC) said, ""Earlier, farmers even mortgaged silver and gave additional interest on loan to buy manure and seeds. But this exploitation by moneylenders too has stopped, thanks to cash income from charoli.""Vadodara-based Spyron Masala Mills is the biggest buyer of charoli from Bordha with annual contract of 200 kg. It must be noted that charoli is collected only once a year.N Shrivastav, additional principal chief conservator of forest, project management unit, said, ""The biggest gain from this programme is forest conservation. Villagers themselves preserve trees as they get extra income from them."""
5a07826f9855b76bf13cab14,Darjeeling: Residents struggle for basic requirements of urban life,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/darjeeling-limited/articleshow/59602375.cms,2017-07-15,,The Times Of India,"Darjeeling has been reeling under a strike, and no one  from local residents to major hill party leaders who had called the strike  knows when it will be withdrawn. The strike has been going on for about a month, but even in the midst the complete shutdown, with no transport, closed shops, banks and ATMs, no internet and not a single tourist, life goes on. How are residents making do without the basic requirements of urban life?FoodAlmost every family in the Hills town stocks up on rations for the entire month at a time. Now, with stocks drying up, several residents have been knocking against downed shutters and buying grain, oil and other essentials at black-market rates. Thankfully, milk is still available in abundance as it has been brought under emergency services like medicines and LPG. But that is about it. As the days roll on, people are forced to subsist on watercress plants and homemade vegetables sold on black from behind car boots or shopkeeper's homes. At dusk, the usual sight is of people walking with battery-run torches on unlit streets, knocking on every downed store shutter in quest of some food, even at a premium. ""We had stocks for close to a month and somehow managed, but now there is a serious scarcity. Food stocks have dwindled in every home,"" says Pema Sherpa, who works as a tourist car driver.While GJM, the party that had first called the bandh, blame the cops and administration, alleging food trucks are bring stopped at Siliguri to cut off the supply to the Hills, the administration alleges that GJM supporters have been looting the trucks and taking the resources to Patlebas, where GJM is headquartered, to feed their own leaders and supporters.TransportWith bus service stalled and no shuttle tourist vehicle operating, the transport system in the Hills have now become dependent on emergency vehicles like ambulances, hearses, funeral cars, school pool cars and doctors' vehicles. Cars with 'Ambulance', 'Funeral', 'On school duty' stickers on windshields, or with a red cross, to signify it as a vehicle on ""emergency duty"" are plying within the town as well as to and from Siliguri, carrying multiple passengers, most of whom are neither sick, dead or school-goers. If the entire vehicle is taken on rent, the charge is around Rs 6,000 for a trip from Darjeeling to Siliguri. For an SUV running shuttle service, each passenger has to pay around Rs 600. ""People have to commute and they were pressuring us to take out our cars. We checked which are the vehicles exempted from the strike and decided to paste such signs and started taking passengers. We know we are taking a risk but have no other choice,"" says a driver who had pasted an ""Ambulance"" sticker on his Tata Sumo and was spotted carrying a group of locals.At least eight cars and 13 mini trucks were attacked by strike supporters, causing the death of a driver. Five NBSTC buses were also either damaged or set on fire, following which the bus service has been withdrawn.Long walksWith no transport available, people who still have to attend government offices and those on emergency duties, such as in hospitals and colleges, are forced to walk for miles. Labourers carrying two full LPG cylinders were spotted walking for over 5km uphill for delivery at households; examinees appearing for a PSC examination had walked 16km to the exam venue; and some hotel workers who were in urgent need to get down to the plains were also reported to have walked 70km in three days. ""Gorkhas by nature are never shy of hard work. So, walking a few kilometres every day is not a problem for us. It is just the incessant rain that is causing a bit of trouble in this period,"" says Vincent Pradhan , a teacher at a government college in Darjeeling, who walked 16km every day to and from his home at Ghoom while practical exams were on.EntertainmentThe indoor game of Ludo has found a new shot at life in the strike town with everyone  from cops on duty to local residents  seen engaging in the game at one time or the other, with nothing much to do for the most part of the day. Hooked on to their smartphone, a group of heads cluttered around a screen has become a common sight across every nook and corner of Darjeeling. ""What else can we do? The evenings have become dull, with all bars and pubs closed. And with no work and loads of free time, Ludo is the best time-pass,"" says tourist guide Pawan Tamang, who finds himself out of work.Among outdoor games, cricket, football and badminton are ruling the streets. However, with all shops closed, rubber or tennis balls have been replaced by strips of hard paper rolled and glued in the shape of balls, and badminton shuttlecocks have been replaced by bunched-up paper projectiles.TransactionWith ATMs and banks shut and people out of business for close to a month, almost every family is suffering from an acute shortage of cash. In this situation, the age-old barter system has made inroads back into Darjeeling  vegetables for biscuits and rice, fuel for liquor, fruits for flour, and milk for nutrition bars and chocolates. For ages, the Nepali-speaking population of the Hills have relied on a unique ""exchange plan"" of sorts to tide over tough times. When in need, people don't hesitate to approach neighbours for cereal or flour, only to return the exact quantities when things improve. Now, they have moved a step ahead and turned to barter. Biju Rai , who runs a stationery shop near the old TV station in Darjeeling, had stacked four crates of biscuits two days before the strike, along with other items. At the onset of the shutdown, he still has ample resources to last days, but no vegetables and very little cash in hand. ""Biscuits have become extremely prized in these circumstances. So, I have started trading the biscuit packets with vegetables like tomatoes, watercress and pumpkin from a local vegetable seller, who grows vegetables in her farm,"" Rai says.EducationWith all schools and colleges in the Hills shut and GJM using children, some of them as young as three-year-olds in their rallies and political programmes, the future of thousands of little ones in the Hills are in jeopardy.Schools like Himali Boarding School and St Joseph's School have all extended summer vacation and say they won't reopen until the unrest is over. Darjeeling has a number of schools that attract students from abroad as well as from other parts of the country. The ongoing turmoil has been a major cause for concern for teachers and parents. GJM had relaxed the shutdown on June 23 to let students return home. Even as most schools held classes for boarders, day-scholars missed out. They could not even take their mid-terms.GJM leaders like MLA Amar Rai, Anmol Thapa and Roshan Giri have openly claimed that students need not go to schools and should focus on the fight for Gorkhaland . ""If students miss out even one or two years because of the movement, their parents will happily agree,"" Rai has said. As a result, most students have no option but to take part in political rallies and play street games all day long.A rally here, a rally there...For Hills people, rallies and political meetings have been a part of everyday life. Now, from 10am, some party  it could be GJM, GNLF, ABGL or CPRM  takes out a rally either jointly or alone from Darjeeling station, takes a tour of the city at times through Mall Road and then congregates at Chowk Bazar. At times, they even go to the district magistrate's office or the local police station and demonstrate for some time. The crowd, comprising the same faces almost every day, is anything from 500- to 2000-strong. The rally ends with the speakers addressing the crowd from the first floor of the Chowk Bazar super market for around an hour before the crowd disperses in the afternoon. ""I attend the rallies every day as there is nothing much to do otherwise,"" a resident of Chowkbazar admits.Internet connectivitySince June 19, internet services have been in the Hills to ensure residents cannot reach out to the world or spread information through social media. But when nothing is on, the internet ban has made life even worse. A group of enterprising youths, however, have discovered a trickle of network in a pocket behind the Mahakal Temple on Mall Road, from where glimpses of north Sikkim can be caught if there is no cloud cover and rain. Since then hundreds, especially young boys and girls, have been flocking there every day with their smartphones, often under umbrellas, from dawn to midnight. People had been carrying laptops to file passport applications, transfer money, file income-tax returns online, check Facebook or simply play online games. However, for the past two days, even that connection has dwindled.""With no internet now, we practically have nothing to do. My regular routine has been to jog in the morning along different parts of the city for two hours, and on my way back, to hold my phone up and look for a feeble connection from here and there. Life without the internet is indeed one of utmost pain,"" grimaces Amit Tamang, a first-year college student.PolicingCops are now everywhere in Darjeeling, mostly in riot gear, lining the streets and route-marching every now and then but for the past one month but people no longer approach them. Since June 9, there has not been a single complaint reported at the Darjeeling Sadar police station. All the 39 complaints registered so far have been suo motu complaints by police against unidentified people or known men, mostly for vandalizing government property. ""On an average, there are around 30 complaints, mostly of petty crimes, thefts, assaults or property disputes. But since the start of the movement, there has been no complaint,"" said an officer.Hotels and touristsFor a hill station that is entirely dependent on tourists, no other section of the society has been more hurt than hoteliers and tour operators. With not a single tourist in the Hills and even Puja bookings being cancelled, hotel owners have asked their employees, mostly from the plains, to go back to their homes and return only after the strike eases. ""I have 19 employees. Keeping them means paying their salary and arranging for food. With no business and acute scarcity of food at this moment, there is no point keeping them here. I have asked all of them to go down and have promised to call them back once the situation eases,"" says a hotel owner on HD Lama Road."

So, yesterday I decided to go to the market and check it out myself. The usual guy we go to had only two kilos of tomatoes left which he was selling for `110 a kilo! When I asked him to reduce the rates, he said he doesn't have enough stock on him and thus can't lower the price.""With the rise in the prices of tomatoes, there are many who feel that it is the Goods and Services Tax (GST) that is responsible for it. Shashi Verma, a resident of central suburbs says, ""We normally go to the nearest Chembur market to do our vegetable shopping. But, two days back when we went there, tomatoes were being sold for `85-100 a kilo. When we asked the vendor about the high price, he said it was because of GST.""Adding to this, a vegetable vendor from the western suburbs says, ""We were told that it is because of the farmer's strike and GST. After the strike got over, the prices went down to `40-50 a kilo. Just before GST, they were being sold for `60 a kilo and now they've reached the maximum  `80-100 a kilo.""While the blame game is still on, a spokesperson from the APMC market in Vashi (wholesale market) feels the need to clear the air. He says, ""People should not believe in such rumours. The hike in the price is not because of GST or farmer's strike at all. It is the lack of rains this year which has to be blamed for the rise in prices. Also, most of the stock have got damaged while being brought to the city and thus most vendors had to throw them away.""Prabha Saoba a resident of Wadala says that the wholesale markets are selling tomatoes at far reasonable rates than the ones which are being sold at retail markets. She says, ""I travelled all the way to Vashi to check out the prices of tomatoes and was surprised that it was being sold for `55-60 a kilo whereas in my area, tomatoes are being sold for `100-120 a kilo.""Rakesh, a vegetable vendor at Pali Hill market in Bandra, says, ""We don't have a choice but to increase the rates of tomatoes. If we buy a kilo for `70-80, we try and sell it for `100-110, so that we can make some profit, else our business won't thrive.""While consumers don't have much choice but buy tomatoes at the rate their local vendor is offering, there are many who are offering discounts to their loyal customers. Vegetable vendor Ramesh Gupta from South Mumbai says, ""Since it isn't easy to give a discount on half a kilo of tomatoes or even less than that, we encourage our customers to shop over a kilo so that we can waive off anything between `30 or `50 on the bulk purchases.""Many took to online purchase of veggies once they got to know about the sky-high prices of tomatoes. However, they did not find solace there as well. Shraddha Vaidyanathan, a resident of Thane says, ""The day the prices shot up, my husband sat down to order tomatoes online. However, he called me up an hour later to tell me that the prices are high there too (about `86 a kilo). There was no point, so in the evening, we went to the local veggie guy and bargained with him and got a kilo of tomato for `75.Rakesh says, ""Consumers are buying on a day-to-day basis, according to their usage."" Adding to this businessman Hemant Shah says, ""If not consumed, vegetables have a high chance of rotting. Also, the tomatoes which are being sold in the market at the moment, are not in a good condition. Thus, the trouble of shopping for it on a daily basis."""

Modi gave a clarion call that India should also 'start up and stand up'.Modi says ""innovation is the biggest goal towards the route of development. Israel has always promoted innovation and technology.""The one big thing that differentiates the Indian and Israeli innovation system is way the Israelis accept failure, and failed entrepreneurs are not stigmatised.In the past, India and Israel have not looked eye-to-eye. For decades India was leaning towards Palestine and the relationship got transformed during the Kargil conflict, when Israel came to India's rescue by supplying sophisticated weapons which helped push back the Pakistani infiltrators in the Kargil zone.Since then, the relationship has grown by leaps and bounds.India launched an Israeli spy satellite, TecSAR, in 2008. India also bought a similar satellite from Israel, RISAT-2, to keep an eye on its hostile neighbours, this was cooperation at the government level.After the visit by Modi, the space agencies of the two countries can now start cooperating in earnest now.Today Israel is a power house of high technology. If India's mission to succeed as 'Start Up' country has to go forward there is a lot to learn from the original 'Start Up Nation' Israel.Many lessons need to be learnt like from seeing the working of one of the top ten most successful venture capital companies JVP, a technology powerhouse.Located in the heart of the Negev Desert where nothing grows, JVP Cyber Labs is rated one of the best. It nurtured infant ideas and in the last few years it helped create 120 companies worth USD 1.3 billion.But, what gives Israel a unique start up ecosystem?YoavTzruya, Partner at JVP Cyber Labs at Beer Sheva in Israel said, ""One of the basic cultural differences that exist in Israel as a start up nation is how we look at failure. In Israel we do not penalise failure per se. We look at the entrepreneurs, who created their companies that failed, as people who have gained from their experience.""""We have been asked by many countries around the world to replicate it, the successful model of innovation, and always culture was an obstacle. People that founded start up and failed were looked down upon. It is critical actually to embrace failure, learn from it rather than look down upon it,"" he said.Israel nurtures the start-up environment. Incubators are set up by the Israeli government, which used to give $600,000 risk free loan to promising starts ups.If companies fail they don't need to pay back the loan but if they succeed they pay back a 3 per cent annual royalty.Israel is an acknowledged world leader in the use of solar and water technology.Israel is a very dry country. Unlike India it is not blessed by the monsoons which bring bountiful rain for us. Israel may lack in rain, but the country has deployed high technology to catch every drop, even waste water is fully recycled. Today Israel is using water as a weapon of peace.Pipes are Israel's weapons of defence against perpetual water shortage. Invented in Israel, drip irrigation is the most common thing in the country.This spectacular success story has been emulated worldwide, where by drop by drop water is supplied to the roots of the plants. Every litre of water irrigates almost 10 times more area than in India.In the Middle East, it is not just oil that is inflammable, countries have gone to war over water. The lack of water is cause for constant tension but sharing technology could offer solutions.Abraham Tenne, till recently chairman, Water Development Agency said, ""Israel is a leader in water technologies. Today water is a bridge for peace and not a target for war. Israel is teaching its neighbours, Jordan and Palestine, techniques for saving water.""In Israel, it is a miracle seeing first-hand how the desert is blooming ever since Israel started using precision agriculture. Israel and India have a deep cooperation in the field of horticulture, with many farmers in Punjab and Gujarat beginning to use Israeli technology.Juicy red tomatoes, coloured bell peppers are all grown in the deserts of Israel. The sun and sand of desert is fertilised with recycled water to bring about a green revolution in the parched soils.Lior Paster, water engineer, Igudanwater for agriculture facility said, ""We collect sewage of 2.5 million people and treat it and send it to the south in good quality for agricultural use, appropriate for crops, vegetables, fruits and flowers.""Despite Israel's love for high technology, it has not permitted any genetically modified crop to be grown by its farmers.Today Israel exports fruits, vegetables and flowers to Europe from its parched landscape.Jack Gilron of Zukerbrg Institute for Water Research, SedeBoqer, said, ""Israel is very water scarce. In the last 15 years, we drought-proofed the country using enough sea water desalination to take care of two-thirds of our domestic needs. We recycle 70 per cent of our municipal waste water for agriculture.""""Between those two actions we have protected our country from drought. There are lot of companies here in Israel which are looking to collaborate with India in the area of water treatment and protecting water resources.""There are many lessons that India could learn from Israel. One big lesson being learning to accept failure as a stepping stone to success."

Prices of vegetables like gourd and lady's finger have also come down from Rs 60 per kg to Rs 35-50 per kg.According to vendors, good supply and stock of vegetables have resulted in the lowering of prices.""During these months, vegetation in plains of Punjab dips which is why vegetables have to be transported from Himachal Pradesh. Due to this, there is constant fluctuation in prices of vegetables,"" said Bittu, a wholesaler at the Sector 26 Sabzi Mandi.Ranjan Kumar, secretary of market committee, UT, Chandigarh, said, ""The fluctuation in prices is seasonal. Prices rise as vegetables like peas get transported from Lahul Spiti during this season. Once the season is over, supply will resume from Punjab which will bring down the prices. It all depends on the arrival of vegetables.""Meanwhile, buyers turned up in less numbers at the mandi on Wednesday. The constant rain since morning had led to water stagnation and mud puddles everywhere which caused trouble for buyers.

Retail price of tomatoes has risen sharply across 17 major cities and breached the Rs 90 per kg mark. There are signs that household budgets are going to be under more stress as wholesale price of onions at Lasalgaon, Maharashtra, last week hit a 19-month high at Rs 1,300 a quintal. The price of these two items serves as a barometer and recent trends are worrisome.Price spikes are not uncommon. What makes the current situation unusual is that it comes at a time of normal monsoon and soon after farmers were gutted on account of a post-demonetisation collapse in prices. A cycle where farmers and consumers are stressed by turn is a sign of fundamental problems. At the same time a birds eye view shows that fruits and vegetables are where farmers are putting more effort on the heels of changing consumption patterns. Consequently, despite two of the last four years having deficient rainfall, production has risen steadily. Even area under cultivation increased and reached 24.92 million hectares last year.Despite positive trends, if neither farmers nor consumers are satisfied, it is on account of factors under the control of policy makers and some beyond them. Sharp swings in climatic patterns have increased in the recent past, which makes agriculture a riskier proposition. Centre and states worsen this situation with an uncertain policy environment. The cumulative impact is that farmers get garbled price signals, which leads to oscillation between glut and shortage. Fixing this problem has to start with governments letting price become the primary signal for sowing, then keeping the economic environment stable for farmers.A stable environment has to be complemented with two other steps. A start has been made by linking 455 markets of 13 states through an online marketplace, with more states expected to follow. This is an important step in breaking the hold of wholesale cartels. But it needs follow up in the form of superior infrastructure. Harvest and post-harvest losses in vegetables are estimated to be upto 12.44% of production. India needs to urgently enhance its cold storage infrastructure by providing private sector with better investment incentives. It is entirely possible to end the cycle of gluts and shortages if we get this policy framework right."

Until last week, onion was selling at Rs 15-18 per kg but this week it has reached Rs 25-30 per kg. As they are used in almost all dishes, rise in prices of tomato and onions always disrupts the household budget.Wholesale price of onion has gone up from Rs 6-8 per kg to Rs 15-18 per kg. As per traders, the hike is because of incessant rains in Maharashtra , from where the state and city gets maximum supply.Another major reason is GST (Goods and Services Tax). ""Most of the transport companies have not revised their systems under GST so very few trucks are plying. Lack of carriage has hit supply, and in turn, the cost,"" said Arvind, a wholesale vegetable dealer of Dubagga.""Also, because of monsoon, the transportation time has increased from three to five days, which turns onions stale. More than 30% of them are discarded because of poor quality,"" said Sheraz Sadiq, another vendor.With seasonal vegetables already selling at a relatively high price because of heavy rains in the producing states, the overall cost of raw vegetables has sky-rocketed in the city.Housewife Shruti Singh said, ""Because of vegetables getting costlier, especially onions and tomatoes , the cost of each meal has gone up. Cooking chicken is cheaper than preparing a vegetarian dinner. Worst part is that though vegetables can be replaced by meat, there is no substitute for onions.""Bank employee Ritika Sharma said she has resorted to buying vegetables from wholesale market even though she has to buy a week's quota in advance. ""Shopping from mandi costs a little less than from street vendors, so I go to Dubagga mandi and buy whatever I want all at once,"" she said.Though the cost of tomato has dropped in wholesale markets in the past few days, it continues to sell at Rs 100-120 per kg in the city. ""For the past three days, tomatoes are selling at Rs 60-65 per kg in the wholesale market. Price dropped because supply is getting back to normal,"" said Rizwan, wholesale trader."

Better Kochi Response Group, a community that consists of doctors, chartered accountants, civil servants and more, has been urging people via various online forums, to stay away from tomatoes for the next fortnight, by which they believe the price should dip.Will it, really? Kochi Times quizzed fiscal experts, customer behaviour analysts and more, to see how such a tactic might play out.Customer behaviour expert Sony V Mathew says, ""I don't think anything can stop customers from buying an item, at least in smaller quantities. However, they can have an effect on the price when they become responsible buyers. For example, many shopkeepers tell me that people now buy tomatoes in quantities ranging from 100 grams to just two pieces."" That, in turn, will affect a perishable product like tomato, explain analysts.Is it illegal to influence an item's price, collectively? ""If someone tries to increase the price artificially, it is unacceptable. But there is nothing wrong if the buyers decide they want to stay away from buying a costly item,"" Sony says.Jose Sebastian, a Kochi-based fiscal expert, says, ""Tomato is a perishable product and therefore, if people decide not to purchase it, sellers will be naturally forced to reduce the price, especially in a State like Kerala where people can do without this product. Those belonging to the lower strata of the society will avoid it as soon as the price increases.""Currently, the price of tomato is on the higher side because of the short supply and also due to higher income groups buying it at the steep cost, he says.""However, if they too decide to steer clear off tomatoes as a result of social media campaigning, ideally, the prices must come down,"" explains Jose.Elaborating on this strategy, S Gopakumar of Better Kochi Response Group explains, ""This is a model of protest that has been successfully used in countries like Japan. Around the time we started the protest a few days ago, the cost of tomato was around `110. In the following days it came down to `85 and I am sure that it will go down further, if we persist with this strategy. Our target is to stabilise it between `50 and `60 and we are spreading this strategy through mediums like Whatsapp.""Tomato is a relatively new entrant in Kerala cuisine and can be easily done away with, say culinary experts. Renowned chef Noushad says, ""It's mostly when we prepare North Indian dishes that we use tomatoes. It can be easily replaced in our dishes. In sambar and rasam, it can be replaced with tamarind. In avial, curd can do the trick. Even in salads, it's not an absolutely necessary item.""He observes that households use tomato while preparing dishes like butter chicken and chicken roast. ""Even for these, we can use tomato puree,"" he says.Sony says that the price rise has also started out a positive trend. ""People have started growing tomatoes in their own homes. What they need for a few curries on a daily basis can be easily sourced from a kitchen garden, a few customers happened to tell me. If the price rise can at least push more people into cultivating enough for their own kitchen, it should be helpful in the long run,"" he says."

According to senior officials, 22 quintals of tomatoes had been sold at the Rythu Bazars in the last three days alone.Presently, a kilo of tomato costs between Rs 85 andRs 100 in Poorna Market. Even road-side vendors are charging in excess of Rs 80-Rs 90 a kg. To make it affordable, the marketing department has fixed the price at Rs 64 a kilo.Speaking to TOI, the marketing department assistant director M Kaleswara Rao said, ""We stocked 10,525 kgs of tomatoes on Saturday for sale at the special counters for next one or two days. We have so far sold around 22 quintals of the tomatoes at the Rythu Bazars.""According to Rao, all the Rythu Bazars need nearly 17,500 kgs of tomatoes to meet the demand from the consumers in a day.""Due to shortage of the tomatoes country-wide, we are forced to source the supply of around 10000 kgs from Kolar in Karnataka . The supply from the Madanapalle market in Chittoor has stopped.

""If there is no proper price in the market, we don't get even the labour charges to pluck tomatoes. This is the reason farmers throw them on the road,"" he said. Though farmers are benefiting from the prices this time around, they are worried because the yield per acre has come down. ""We thought we could reap the benefits of good tomato prices but there is a problem. I have 8 acres for tomatoes and used to take 1,000 boxes (each of 15 kg) every day to the market. But this time, I could take only 200 boxes. We don't get proper groundwater even after drilling up to 1,200 feet.

Even allergy to dal items also seems to be uncommon, states 'A cross sectional study of the profile of food allergy among patients with chronic urticaria in Kerala'.The study was conducted by the department of pulmonary medicine, Government TD Medical College, Alappuzha, to identify the skin sensitivity to various food allergens in patients with chronic urticaria and to analyse the regional pattern of food allergy in Kerala. The study shows that 98% of patients with chronic urticaria had some form of food allergy. The common offending food allergens were wheat (28%), garlic (22%), ground nut (20%), cashew nut (18%), prawns (17%), ginger (16%), peas (12%) and black pepper (10%).""Food allergy can occur in isolation or in association with various clinical conditions such as chronic urticaria. The prevalence of food allergy is on the rise, owing probably to the changing food habits, multiplicity of food items with innumerable components and overuse of food additives and colouring agents.

The itching of the skin in case of chronic urticaria is more prominent at night. Prevalence of chronic urticaria is around 1% in general population and both children and adults can develop it. Women are affected twice as often as men and the common age group affected is between 30 and 50 years.Published in the Journal of Evidence Based Medicine and Healthcare (JEBMH), the study selected 100 patients with chronic urticaria who had predisposition towards developing certain allergic hypersensitivity reactions.""The treatment of chronic urticaria is challenging and if the aetiology is food allergy, the patients can lead a normal life by simply avoiding the offending foods and its components.

However, this year the price of tomato, which was Rs 30/kg during the same season last year, has already touched Rs 80/kg in the wholesale market, indicating that this is also going to be an expensive festive season. Central Market tomato traders association president R S P Sekhar said that they usually get around 10,000 boxes of tomatoes daily at the market, with each box containing 15 kilograms of tomatoes, but now the supply has dropped to only 4000 boxes.The price of one box of tomato in the wholesale market was Rs 1,000 on Sunday, and it sold at Rs 60/kg in the Central market, but the better quality fruits were priced at Rs 80, he said. The same was witnessed at the farmers markets in the city.K Ramesh of Viswanathapuram, said that he had gone to the Chokkikulam farmers market, where he was not given the liberty to pick the tomatoes. ""I was told all the fruits were good and that one kilogram cost Rs 80, so I bought half a kilogram because he price is too high to be burdened with a couple of rotten tomatoes,'' he said.In Anna Nagar, S Ganeswari purchased a quarter kilogram for Rs 24. ""A kilogram was being sold for Rs 96 and the trader told me he would give it for Rs 95 if I purchased a kilogram. Who wants to buy tomatoes for so much?'' she said. V Chellam , a trader, said that the supply from the local farms in Theni and Dindigul district, where tomato is usually cultivated in thousands of acres, was almost nil at present and the market was getting its supply from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh . ""There doesn't seem to be a possibility of getting supplies from the local farmers at least for the next two months, so the price will only continue to go up and may touch Rs 100 in the wholesale market soon,'' he said."

However, prices are high compared to previous Aadi seasons.Farmers say it is in the Tamil month of Aadi they start harvesting the summer crop. As the harvest has commenced and inflow of vegetables to markets has resumed, the prices have dropped.Tomato prices, which hovered around Rs 90-Rs 95 per kg last week, have dropped to Rs 80 on Tuesday morning. The price of small onions too has come down to Rs 85 per kg from Rs 95-Rs 100 in the past one month. Garlic, which cost Rs 200 per kg two months ago, is now priced at Rs 100 per kg.""Vegetables such as onions, chillies, tomatoes, and brinjal, among others, are ususally harvested this time of the year. And prices drop as they are easily availabile in markets,"" said Diriviyam, a farmer who comes to Uzhavar Sandhai in R S Puram. Since farmers anticipate a shortage of labour in the coming days, they have started harvesting whatever is grown. ""Several labourers will go on a pilgrimage in Aadi month. The crops, meanwhile, will start rotting after the onset of rain. So, we want to finish harvest as soon as possible,'' said a farmer.The prices are, however, still high compared to the previous Aadi months. Farmers say Rs 80 per kg for tomato is very high for this period of the year. Usually, vegetables such as tomato would be sold at throwaway prices during Aadi. This year, the cultivated area was less compared to previous years, due to water shortage. Also, the yield per acre has come down. ""On a normal year, the summer harvest will yield 10-20 tonnes of tomato per acre. Because of water shortage and extreme heat, the yield has dropped by 60% this year,"" said Senthil Kumar , a tomato farmer from Madhampatti.Farmers said they didn't expect the prices to drop further, a phenomenon usually witnessed as Aadi progresses. ""We have postponed harvest of onion to September after the rains,'' said Vijaykumar, a farmer, hinting that if at all there was a further price fall it would be after September. However, the cost of green chillies has been steadily increasing over the past one week, from Rs 30-Rs 40 per kg to Rs 88 on Tuesday. ""This is because chillies are coming from Mysuru. We are yet to get local stock from Erode, Chettipalayam and Thalavadi,'' said R Satheesh, a vegetable vendor at MGR Market."

This has forced them to hike rates urging us also to maintain the same. There will be no relief until this changes,"" said vendor Sadiq Shaikh.TOI had reported last week that poor rain in Maharashtra and Karnataka had led to a serious shortage in crop output. Resultantly leading to the low tomato produce and subsequent shortage.Weather parameters in Goa have also played foul for vendors in Goa. ""While supplying freshly-harvested tomatoes to the state, some of the stock got ruined after being hit by rains along Goa's ghats. Tomatoes unlike onions and potatoes cannot be hoarded and are easily perishable,"" said another vendor.They further added that rates will continue to remain high for another fortnight or so. Until then, tomatoes continue to be out of the common man's reach.Sharing his thoughts on the scenario, agriculture director Ulhas Pai Kakode said, ""Currently, there is low tomato stock in the market available for sale, therefore the exorbitant rates.

The price of tomato has shot up by 25% in the past 15 days, with the vegetable selling for as much as Rs100 a kilo in some markets. Prices of other vegetables, such as capsicum and beans, have also shot up by Rs 20 akilo the the past two weeks.Vegetable retailers at Lake Market on Sunday sold tomato at Rs 100 a kilo, while prices in markets like the one at Manicktala hovered between Rs 95 and Rs 100 per kilo. ""Our hands are tied now. Prices have shown a sudden spurt at the wholesale markets in the past one week, and there has been an unprecedented rise,"" said Gopal Kundu , a retailer at Lake Market.In Koley market , one of the largest wholesale markets of the city, tomato sold at Rs 70 to Rs 72 a kilo. ""Most of the tomato supplies in Kolkata market come from Bengaluru at this time of year. There are price fluctuations every year, but this time it is beyond calculations,"" said Anup Gupta, a vegetable wholesaler at Koley Market.According to Uttam Mukherjee, chief supervisor of Koley market, supplies have come down by almost 30%. ""If a wholesaler was importing 10 trucks of tomatoes, he is now getting eight. Shortage in supplies is pushing up prices,"" he said. Some traders also procure tomato from wholesalers in Indore. ""We have never imagined that prices could go up to Rs 80 per kilo. There is a shortage in production. The Centre had provided support to farmers, but that seems to have had no reflection on the prices,"" said Sushil Soni, a tomato wholesaler in Indore, Madhya Pradesh.Vegetable traders on Sunday pointed out that agitating farmers across the country had destroyed truckloads of tomato last month. ""In some cases, the tomato crop was not even harvested,"" Soni said.Prices of other vegetables, mostly the ones procured from other states, have also headed north. ""Prices of capsicum and beans have gone up by Rs 20 per kilo in the last two weeks,"" said Kartik Saha , a vegetable retailer at Manicktala market.What has come as a breather is the stable price of local vegetables like striped gourd and brinjal. ""Prices of these vegetables have remained steady and are being sold between Rs 35 and Rs 40 per kilo,"" Mukherjee said.Buyers know there is going to be a rise and fall in the price of seasonal produce; it's a normal demand-and-supply thing playing itself out. But, when there is an abnormal and unchecked rise in the price of certain vegetables, then it may indicate something more than usual market forces at play. The situation calls for much stricter monitoring."

In the past week, tomato prices have skyrocketed leaving Bengalureans in a fix. While there is no clarity on what has caused the price rise, many feel that the Goods and Service Tax ( GST ) is the culprit behind it. Bangalore Times finds out more...BT found out that tomatoes were being sold in the market between Rs 75-90 per kilo. ""Of late the price of tomato has gone up. Last week when we brought tomatoes, it was Rs 74 per kg. Earlier, we used to pay as less as Rs 20 per kilo,"" says Pallavi Sengupta, a city-based professional, adding that the increased price has cut down the usage of tomatoes in her home by half. ""Since tomatoes are so expensive, we have cut down our usage by half and try our best not to waste any food,"" she says. But many like George Thomas, banking professional from the city, say that the increased price has not made a drastic change to their diet. ""I haven't faced an issue as such. Since I can afford it, I still buy the same amount of tomatoes. But am sure there are many who are facing problems and have cut down on their intake,"" he says.Nishtha Nayyar, a working professional in the city, says that she prefers buying vegetables especially tomatoes, from a vegetable market than a supermarket. ""We bought tomatoes for Rs 60 last week. Am sure in a supermarket it's as expensive as Rs 85 per kilo."" But has the increased price affected her in any way? ""Of course it has. We don't make dishes like pasta and others that require more tomatoes, as often as we used to. Since the price has gone up, I have become more conscious of the usage. In fact, my domestic help says that she has reduced using tomatoes in her household considerably,"" she adds.Contrary to the belief that GST may have a role in the price rise of tomatoes, vegetable vendors and owners tell us that GST has no bearing at all. ""Obviously there has been less rainfall  that has had an impact in the production. In addition to that, tomatoes are very cyclic. If one year the prices drop, the next year it shoots up,"" explains Amar Krishna Murthy, CEO, Towness. ""If the prices drop, people stop growing tomatoes. The following year, when the demand goes up there isn't enough quantity to meet the needs, which in turn results in the steep rise of prices,"" he says.Chandru, who works at a HOPCOMS stall, says that the monsoons have created a shortage. ""If we ask for 500 quintals, we get only 100 quintals. How will the demands be met?"" he asks, saying the scenario is likely to last for a month or so. He also clarifies that unlike what many think, GST has not affected the prices of vegetables and fruits. ""There is a solid shortage of tomatoes in the market,"" he adds.Another representative at Namdhari's Fresh, on the condition of anonymity, said that the prices of tomatoes are expected to remain the same for another month. ""It is all because of the monsoon. If the weather does not improve, the prices will continue to soar,"" he sums up. Amar, however, points out that he hasn't experienced a slump in sales as such, as tomato is one of the basic necessities in cooking. ""Tomato is hard to replace in cooking,"" he says adding that people are still buying it online inspite of the price rise."

At present, Delhi is only getting tomatoes from Himachal,"" he said.Across the city , buyers started to panic as the price of tomatoes zoomed by about Rs 20-40 since the beginning of the month.

Prices are likely to increase further in coming days, said vegetable traders, adding that monsoon arrived late this year which led to poor crop of seasonal vegetables, while heavy rains later damaged the produce. Tomato was worst hit by rainfall in Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh.Seasonal vegetables hit by unfavourable weather conditions include brinjal, ladyfinger, bitter gourd, colocasia and potatoes. Cost of bottle guard, pumpkin, pointed guard and cauliflower has dropped up to 40%.Wholesale dealer Shahikant Singh said, ""Rains damaged the tomato crop in Karnataka and also affected its transport."" Another wholesale dealer Kripal said, ""The supply has yet to normalise, hence cost of tomato and other vegetables will increase further.""Vegetables that have become cheaper are those which are grown locally or within the state. There was a glut since the produce could not be sent to other states because of heavy rains, so their prices went down.

With prices hovering around Rs 100/kg since about a fortnight now, the humble tomato  which is scientifically a fruit but commonly known as a vegetable owing to its rampant use in cooking savoury rather than sweet meals  is giving a fright to the common man. While vendors at some of the local markets claim that the price hike is due to interrupted supply because of the rains, those in the food business are among the worst hit. With tomato prices going through the roof, many are resorting to substitutes like canned puree and ketchup, leading to their dwindling stocks at various departmental stores.Gurleen Singh, owner of Hindusthan Dhaba , said they are bearing a loss of 3-4% at the moment. ""We are hoping that the situation will get better in the coming weeks. If the crisis persists, we will be forced to increase the price of our dishes by `5-`10 on an average,"" he said, explaining that gravy items, especially makhnis, are cooked with fresh tomatoes. However, Rahul Arora, proprietor of Paranthe Wali Galli , said their business remains unaffected as they don't use fresh tomatoes and cook with tomato puree instead.""We get our stock of canned tomato puree and since the price of that has not increased, we are not feeling the pinch,"" he told us. Chef Rangan Niyogi seconded Rahul as he said tomato puree is indeed a preferred ingredient in Indian kitchens. ""Readymade tomato puree is a great help in times of crisis. It can be used for churning out a variety of dishes. Generally, we use fresh tomatoes in numerous Indian dishes, like chicken butter masala, dal makhni, methi saag, aloo dum etc. But, currently I am using tinned tomato puree in place of fresh tomatoes and Kashmiri mirch in place of red chilli powder to make them taste close to tomato. However, in case of tomato chutney, it's not possible to substitute fresh tomatoes. For making tomato or minestrone soup, I am using carrot and tomato puree in place of fresh tomato. While carrot lends the vegetable flavour, tomato puree helps in getting the right taste and colour of the soup,"" he said.According to local vendors, tomato prices shooting up during this season is a common occurrence as rains spoil the stock. Tomatoes that have a shelf life of 3-4 days are hard to stock up at a time not many farmers have access to cold storage. Chef Joymalya Banerjee , however, feels the crisis is ""created"". ""Monsoon comes every year and it's not believable that the entire stock got ruined due to exceptional rains. Yet, there's a dearth in supply. So, if I ask vendors to deliver 5 kilos, they are giving only 2 kilos. This has been happening for the past two weeks,"" he said. The chef added that he doesn't believe in passing the burden on to the consumers. ""Everyone in the restaurant business keeps a buffer. For example, if the making cost of a dish is `10, it's sold at `30. For the loss of a rupee or so, it's not feasible to hike the price of a dish. There was a time when potato prices were hiked to an extent that some biryani makers dropped the aloo from the dish. That was juvenile, as it's not fair to victimise consumers all the time. I will hike the prices only when I can't bear the burden anymore,"" he reasoned.Though tomato prices started coming down on Wednesday and were available at `80 a kilo at some places, online grocery platforms such as Big Basket and Grofers continued to sell the kitchen must at over `100 a kilo. It was `109 a kilo at Big Basket and `110 a kilo at Grofers on Thursday. Cherry tomatoes and the organic variety came at `280 and `172.50 a kilo respectively."

But tomato is, by comparison, an orphan.Remember, it was only weeks ago that we read about tomato growers in distress  selling their produce at as low as one rupee a kilo or simply throwing it away in protest on highways in drama reminiscent of La Tomatina, the festival held in the town of Buol, Spain  sans the festivities. In fact, this appears to be as much an annual occurrence in parts of India  particularly in the districts of Nasik and Kolar, the biggest tomato-growing areas  as the Valencian festival. What gives?At first blush, it would seem the tomato is getting squished entirely by seasonal factors and market forces, like so much other agricultural produce in India  particularly fruits and vegetables  that does not get government support price. Growing tomatoes is particularly dicey, says Aruna Urs, a farmer-in-residence at the think-tank Takshashila Institution, comparing it to a Las Vegas crapshoot. Unseasonal rain or unexpected heat, a mandi strike or market glut, could be the difference between boom and bust.Over the years, farmers have learned to navigate the treacherous terrain  not always successfully  using seeds that yield thick-skinned tomatoes (for longevity and ease of transport) and timing the pick to market. Urs himself speaks of planting this April by car headlights in the dead of the night to catch the right temperature (too warm and the seeds die).The result has been a bonanza  Rs 68/kilo in the wholesale market last week when anything above Rs 10/kilo is considered rich pickings. So if farmers who got crushed by Rs 1/kg price during the market glut are making a killing at Rs 100 a kilo, who can blame them? By the way, stories about middlemen milking it are vastly exaggerated. They do, but not to the extent of some of the tomato crorepati farmers who gamble by leasing hundreds of acres in what is a high-wire  high-vine  act.Still, the price variation of 100x is not just a factor of seasons and market forces, but also of cultural and culinary habits. India is notoriously shy of eating frozen and canned goods. No self-respecting Indian would be caught using tomato that is in any way processed or pureed, sliced or diced, into a can or container. Thanks to vast tracts of arable and fecund lands, landing fresh produce is no problem in most parts of the country even if there is a groundwater crisis.By contrast, in the US, where tomato accounts for 22% of vegetable consumption (outside the technicality of it being a fruit), more than 50% of tomatoes are consumed as tomato products  processed, pureed, pasted etc. What did the papa tomato say to the baby tomato? A: Hurry and ketchup! goes the joke. Q: How do you get rid of unproductive tomatoes? A: Can them. As a result, retail price of tomatoes in the US has hovered between a low of $1.21 and a high $2.47 per pound over the last 20 years  nothing like the Rs 1 to Rs 100 variation in India.To be sure, theres enormous merit in the way Indians consume fresh produce, including the tomato in all its fiery colour and cool completeness (Pablo Neruda). Instead of eating fruits and vegetables in their original state, much of the West, particularly the US, soup them up with sodium and sugar, adding needless calories and subtracting dietary fibre. Last year, the grocery chain Whole Foods invited outrage and ridicule by selling pre-peeled oranges.But there is now sufficient research to show that frozen produce is not always nutritionally leached, and in some cases, enhances it. Sans sodium, canned is not dicey either. Of course, there is nothing to beat fresh, but as long as India does not accept enforced longevity of produce, both farmers and consumers will have to periodically deal with crapshoots in the fruit and vegetable market."

Supplies of onions in Market Yard have dwindled because of rotting in the godowns during the rains.Meanwhile, the price of tomato , the other kitchen staple, simmered to Rs 50-60 per kg from Rs 100 in July. Dilip Khaire, chief administrator of Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), Pune told TOI that the rainy season often sees fluctuation in prices because of the problem it poses for reaping vegetables from the fields.""The recent rise in onion prices is the result of stocks rotting in the godowns they are stored in during the recent rain,"" Khaire said. He added that vegetable crops are susceptible to disease during the rainy season. ""Areas around Pune, such as Velhe, Mulshi, Bhor, Ambegaon and Junnar, that are to the west of Pune received good rainfall in the last few days, which caused supply problems in many vegetables, including onions,"" he saidNew onion stocks will enter the markets post-Diwali, Khaire added. APMC officials had earlier told TOI that incessant rain after mid-July damaged the tomato crops, causing supply to fall and prices to go up to Rs 100 per kg.Onion supply data from APMC showed that since August 1, when close to 11,423 quintals of onions came into the APMC market, supplies dipped to 9,615 quintals on August 2 and 8,985 quintals on August 3.Though 18,760 quintals of onion entered the wholesale market on August 4, prices continued their upward trendfrom Rs 700 to Rs 1,500 on August 1 to Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,600 on August 4. Another APMC official said onions in the wholesale market were being sold at around Rs 22 per kg on Thursday, which went up to Rs 25 on Friday.""The reduction in rainfall over the last few days has also caused a dip in cultivation of vegetables, including onions,"" he said. Yakub Pathan, owner, Fresh Vegetable Market, Wakad, said the retail price of onion is bound to be higher on Saturday.""From Rs 30 on Friday, it may go up to Rs 35 to Rs 40 on Saturday depending on the supply with retailers. Tomato supplies have normalized to an extent, but onion supplies are 50% less in the wholesale market on account of some stocks rotting due to rains,"" said Pathan.Vegetable vendors in the city on Friday were selling onions at Rs 30 per kg, as against Rs 15 on August 2. ""Tomato prices have come down to Rs 50-Rs 60. Though tomato prices have come down there is less supply,"" Inder Sen, a vendor in Koregaon Park, said."

The tuber, which was sold at `14 a kg a month back, now costs `30.Even as the State Government fixed the upper limit of onion at `17 a kg last week and opened Maitri shops (model fair price outlets) to sell it across the State to unburden the consumers, the retailers flout the order with impunity reportedly for lack of enforcement.General secretary of Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said, they are unable to supply onion at `16 a kg to Maitri shops as the supply price soared by `8 to `10. The price may escalate further due to scanty supply from the source States, he said.Odisha largely depends on Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh for onions. The supply came down drastically as the crop was ruined in Andhra due to lack of rain during kharif season and onions worth around `100 crore was damaged in floods in MP last month.Now, we completely depend on Nashik where the onion was priced at `2,500 to `2,600 per quintal on Tuesday. What can we do if the product is high priced at the source? We are managing since we had booked the commodity at less price a fortnight back, Panda said.Though Odisha, which consumes around 1500 tonne onion daily, stands second in the country after Maharashtra in area under onion cultivation, the productivity of the crop is very less compared to other major onion producing States.Panda said Odisha produces nearly 1.2 lakh tonne onion every year. But, it fails to utilise it within the State as a major share is diverted to Raipur. He, however, claimed that the price here is less compared to other States where the edible tuber is being sold at more than `40 a kg.Both the State Government and the Centre have to intervene to check the price rise. The Centre has to hold talks with vested interest traders in Nashik to regulate the onion price, he added."
5a0b440a9855b76bf13cd90a,Tomato price touches Rs. 100 a kg,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tomato-price-touches-rs-100-a-kg/article19255222.ece,2017-07-11,,The Hindu,"Tomato @ Rs. 100 a kg has become the talk of the town all over Chittoor district, in spite of it having South Indias largest tomato market at Madanapalle. The impact is also felt all over the South and the northern States. Currently, the crop is not raised in Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan due to adverse climatic conditions. These two States are the usual competitors to the Madanapalle grades.During the last one month, the tomato trade has been playing truant with not only the farmers, but also agents from across India, and the domestic retail market in Chittoor, Kadapa, Anantapur and Bellary (Karnataka). The price which stood at Rs. 20 a kg in the first week of June started taking giant leaps week after week, and now reached a level virtually creating panic among the public at Rs. 100 a kg.Alarming dip in arrivalsAs per the latest trend, the wholesale market price on Monday stood at Rs. 78 per kg (first grade) and the second grade at Rs. 48-54 per kg (based on quality and size). The arrival for the day was 241 metric tonnes. There had been an alarming dip in the arrivals since a week from 400 MT last week, followed by 311 MT on Thursday last and 277 MT on Sunday. In contrast, arrivals peaked to 750 MT per day in June-July 2016.The first grade stock, forming 40% of the arrivals, is exported to the metros in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and MP and some malls in Tirupati, Chittoor and Srikalahasti in the district. The second grade is sent to the urban centres of Chittoor district with a mind-blowing retail price at Rs. Rs. 90-100 a kg in vegetable markets and petty shops.This is double the wholesale price. Same situation is reported from elsewhere in towns of surrounding districts of Anantapur, Kadapa; and bordering Kolar and Chikballapur districts of Karnataka, while the price is even slightly up in the border areas of Tamil Nadu. The steep hike is attributed to the damage of the stock during transit, escalation of transportation charges and poor shelf life.Turns invisibleThe impact is clearly felt on the hotel industry and households.A majority of home-makers are forced to substitute the prized vegetable with tamarind juice. The roadside eateries and pani-poori carts are doubly cautious while using it; and it has turned invisible in salads of considerably big restaurants and bars. Though most customers tend to avoid buying it, retail and petty traders are not affected by the scenario, with the smooth disposal of small stocks thanks to a limited number of customers essentially in need of the temporarily unreachable vegetable. Meanwhile, traders said the situation would ease by mid August."

The rate of green chillies was Rs. 80 a kg and carrot Rs. 60 a kg in retail market.There was, however, something to cheer for consumers when they went to market as all dals registered a steep decline in prices over last year.The Directorate of Economics and Statistics attributed the decline to higher production because the cropped area of pulses went up. The pulses production in 2016-17 was estimated at 5.29 lakh tonnes which was 2.82 lakh tonnes more than the previous year.Agriculture Production Commissioner C. Parthasarathi told The Hindu that the hike in prices of tomatoes and green chillies was a regular phenomenon at this time of the year because they were cultivated in high temperatures from April to mid-June, which led to poor yield. Hence, it was decided on Monday to invest Rs. 10 crore on shade nets where they would be grown next year. He dismissed carrot as of no use to the common man.Telangana was largely dependent on purchase of tomatoes from Madanapalle in Chittoor district and Chintamani and Kolar in Karnataka from June to August. As the crop in Karnataka and Maharashtra was also damaged this year due to rains, the stock of Madanapalle was diverted to those States, said G. Lakshmi Bai, Director, Agricultural Marketing.She expected heavy arrivals at Bowenpally market yard here which is the main source of vegetable supply in October as fresh sowings have just started. But, the present rate of tomatoes would continue for at least a fortnight.The price of tomatoes went up steadily from Rs. 30 a kg last month. The hike was Rs. 20 in the last two days."

Amid reports of differences in the price at various retail outlets, the city administration came to the rescue of the locals by making onions available for `20 per kg at 37 government-run fair price shops.Assistant Civil Supplies Officer (ACSO) R C Tudu said 35 quintals of onions were supplied to fair price shops on Saturday. He further pointed out that the retail price of onion at some places rose to `28 per kg on Sunday, with the wholesalers claiming the price of fresh consignment to be `2,400 per quintal. The wholesalers are selling onions for `2,600 per quintal after adding the transportation cost, Tudu added.The officer claimed that the fair price shops will sell fresh stocks at no profit-no loss basis, adding that each wholesaler has been allowed to maintain a maximum stock of 300 quintals.There are no reports of hoarding at the local level. The citys estimated consumption of onions per day is about 130 quintals, claim sources in Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare department. Meanwhile, the hike in prices of vegetables has added to the woes of the consumers. The rise in onion price is an additional burden with tomato selling at `70-80 per kg, and most of the vegetables being sold at `40 and above, a housewife, Manavi Sharma, said."

According to retailers, this is perhaps the first time that tomato prices have crossed the Rs. 100 mark, according to retailers. The higher quality tomatoes from Bangalore cost a bit more at Rs. 120 a kg in Mumbai, they said.Every monsoon, prices would go up to around Rs. 80 due to shortage, but this time it is worse. There is an acute shortage in the market, Harishchandra Gupta, a vegetable vendor in the western suburbs, said.Sources said the sudden shortage in tomatoes is a direct fallout of the state-wide protest by farmers last month. They said rampaging mobs of farmers demanding loan waivers had destroyed truckloads of tomatoes across the State. This, sources said, had forced a large number of marginal tomato farmers to destroy their standing crop as they feared the protest could continue.Small farmers were scared. The off-take from their fields had stopped. Fearing more loss, they preferred to uproot the standing crop much before the harvest and plant other crops. This has lead to a supply problem, which is expected to continue till August, a tomato trader said.In just two days, prices have gone up from Rs. 80 per kg to Rs. 100 per kg. Two months ago, tomato was selling at Rs. 16 per kg.This is the part of the year when Maharashtra supplies tomatoes to many parts of the country including north India. The shortage at in the State has not only pushed prices up in Mumbai, but also in U.P., Rajesh Kumar, a vegetable seller, said.Prices up at retail chainsAt supermarkets like Big Bazaar, tomatoes were selling for Rs. 85 to Rs. 90 per kg. Surprisingly, prices at the comparatively upmarket Godrej Natures Basket was lower at Rs. 67 per kg. Analysts said this is because such stores have long term supply contracts with growers.Tomato prices touched Rs. 80 in Mira-Bhayandar and Vasai-Virar, evoking strong reactions from homemakers. Its not possible to buy tomatoes any more, said Ruma Bose, a Vasai resident.Officials at the Agricultural Produce Marketing Corporation (APMC), Vashi said the supply of tomatoes has gone down by nearly half. While the demand across the city and its suburbs is more close to 3,000 quintal per day, today only about 1,290 quintal has come to the APMC, an APMC official said.Shivaji Pahinkar, secretary, APMC Vashi, said wholesale prices hovered between Rs. 45 and Rs. 60 per kg on Thursday. Declining to pinpoint why tomato supply has dried up, Mr. Pahinkar attributed it to the vagaries of crop production and market economics. We cannot say for sure why there is a surge in prices, he said, while ruling out GST as a factor.Regional mandis (markets) from where retailers procure their supplies are charging between Rs. 70 and Rs. 80 per kg, which is being sold in retail at Rs. 100. We are not responsible for the retail prices, said Mr Pahinkar. You can add 30% to our prices for transport and miscellaneous charges, he added.Ramkrishna Yadav, a vegetable seller at Mira Road, is not happy with the soaring prices.We plan on picking up a certain amount of vegetables at the wholesale market, but we come away with much less as prices are high. This has been the situation for the past fortnight.Ganesh Pinglay, a wholesaler in Vashi, said this price rise could be due to shortfall in production. A couple of months ago, tomato prices hit rock bottom, and farmers could not even recover their production cost, so they didnt go ahead with the second tomato crop. Now they will plant another crop, which should come to the market in another month-and-a-half, he said.Two months ago, tomato prices fell so much farmers couldnt recover production cost, so they didnt go ahead with the second tomato cropGanesh PinglayVashi-based wholesale dealer"

Nallasamy, president of the association here in a press release.Mr. Nallasamy, who is also the president of Federation of Tamil Nadu Agriculturists Association, criticised the proposal of the State Government for sanction of power connection under tatkal system to farmers, saying it would not be of any use to economically backward farmers.The one-time payments of Rs. 2.75 lakh fixed for five hp motor and Rs. 3 lakh for 10 hp motor will suit only the affluent section of cultivated, Mr. Nallasamy said.Holding the government responsible for the rapid rise in the price of tomato, he said the evaluation of requirements for domestic use and export and the productivity level ought to have been the basis for determining the acreage of cultivation.The practice in vogue in other countries is ignored in India.

Not on the dance floor as her excellent grooving in films such as Kaabil makes everyone presume . It is at fitness studio where the energetic actress perspires after a vigorous round of kick boxing. Sceptics need to watch her video on Instagram to understand the importance she gives to fitness. On the International Yoga Day, the actress went a step further when she demonstrated how an extremely difficult scorpion pose, part of yoga, could be executed.Urvashis passion for weight training despite busy film schedule leave even her die hard fans bewildered.Some might find her schedule back breaking, taxing and even bordering on insanity, but for this Haridwar girl it is a routine she does with a smirk on her face. And through social media, she is able to motivate her fans on what more can be done than just the humdrum gym schedule.Urvashi, who came to launch Golds Gym in Gurugram recently, describes herself as a professional athlete. Mom was also an athlete; so fitness runs in my blood. Since childhood, I was ingrained into sports. It plays an important part in my life. Fitness is just like marriage; you cannot cheat on it and think it would benefit you. People need to incorporate it as part of their daily life, she says.If I hadnt been into films, I would have still continued with my workout. I do a healthy blend of mixed martial arts, dancing, functional training and swimming. These exercises give me ample strength, endurance, flexibility and stamina. The idea is to surprise your body with new kind of exercises. If you do the same gym workout, body goes into a comfort zone. Yes, I do weight training like squats, bench press, lunges but I keep rotating them.Sporty girlInterestingly, Urvashi has been a national level basketball player. Any outdoor sport like volleyball can also be played as a workout. It would be a surprise for many to know that I was into multiple sports like javelin, high jump, long jump at St. Joseph Convent.Pointing out that any kind of aerobic exercise helps in shaping up an individuals body, Urvashi says: It helps you to burn calories. It all depends on which body part you want to focus on. If you want great thighs work on lunges.She maintains that fitness has to be a lifelong goal. If you are healthy inside, you are healthy outside. I eat avocado and green vegetables. I take egg whites but keep alternating them with upma and poha. We have lot of protein in our dals, which I take along with broccoli. I have an addiction for green tea; I take eight cups of tea. It has lot of anti oxidants.Shunning supplementsWhile her colleagues in the film industry take supplements, Urvashi doesnt touch them at all.Though I am from glamour industry, I am against taking supplements. I dont look down at people who take shakes but why not take natural home-made diet instead of powder. I have won so many pageants because of my hard work. I never had protein shake in my life. Avocado, tomatoes, coconut juice, lemons, onions, tomatoes and garlic are all superfoods.Like any young woman, Urvashi likes chocolates, dark chocolates.But she also knows how to burn calories and not let the saccharine harm her physique.The idea is to surprise your body with different sets of exercises."

Our two-inch tongue rules our six-feet body. And the stomach takes on the role of a garbage bag, says the restaurateur. While Shettys two aforementioned eateries have been the go-to place for greasy dosas and cheesy pizzas, his new mission is to change the way we eat with his latest offering: Aharveda, located inside Golden Chariot.Aharveda has been decorated in warm shades of yellow with verses from the Gita and vedas painted on the wall and copper chandeliers above each table. The server welcomes us with a Red Roar (Rs 150) drink comprising carrot, beetroot, tomato, mint, betel leaves, coriander and gooseberries. Served at room temperature, the taste is of a Bloody Mary without the alcohol, we joke.Shetty, who started Aharveda, a food science company that conducts sessions of the importance of healthy eating, and using food to treat imbalances, shares an anecdote. We have gone to the moon, in the bargain we have lost our own powers. We understand everything other than ourselves. Picture this, theres a water tank with a faulty hole through which dirty water seeps in. This water goes to all the houses in the building. Every family, sends the sample for checking, pumps it with pesticide and insecticide to clean the water and uses it for consumption. Wouldnt it be wiser if we repaired that hole? says Shetty, who has created recipes that are an extension of his philosophy.Ahar means food in Sanskrit and it is really our medicine shop, says Shetty, offering us a cream of mushroom soup thats light on the palate, but not on flavours. Garnished with mushroom slices and a drizzle of coconut milk, we dont miss the usual onion, garlic or cream. The surprise is the pizza, with its crisp base of tapioca flour and a cheesy topping of cashew nut dust. It has everything and more a vegetarian pizza would have  olives, tomato paste and capsicums. Our eyebrows remain raised as we dig into the Mexican platter (Rs 350) of tacos, made with rajgira seeds and corn, and nachos served with a spicy salsa, guacamole, and a walnut and cashew nut sauce that replaces cheese.The Ahar Veda thali served on silverware has rice rotis, a roasted potato and corn cutlet, besan chura, rasam, cauliflower sabzi and sukka suran (elephant yam) and a serving of kheer. The offering is complete with pickled carrots (dried in-house by Shettys team and made in small batches so it doesnt need oil). The chaas (Rs 90) made from coconut milk is frothy and creamy.Shettys diversion into healthycooking began 10 years ago, when the teetotaller and non-smoker went to the doctor gasping for breath. All my parameters were abnormal, I had high blood pressure, uric acid, blood pressure, diabetes. What does health mean, I asked myself? recalls Shetty, who went on to study naturopathy. I am a second-generation restaurateur and I started working in the kitchen when I was in the seventh standard. So, I understand human emotions when it comes to food. I want my customers to believe that they can counter imbalances by choosing the right food, he asserts.If you head out to Aharveda, do remember, that their last order is at 8 p.m., as according to naturopathy rules, you shouldnt be eating later than that.Aharveda , Andheri West; 40722211/40722212"

But, the market had been receiving only half the load in the past few weeks owing to lack of rainfall and low yield.On Friday, arrival of additional five lorry loads eased the escalating cost. Only 25% of tomatoes arrived from the State Tamil and the rest was sourced from neighbouring States of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.Small onions were also priced high owing to fewer load arrivals and was even sold up at Rs. 110 per kg in retail market.P.Sukumar, joint secretary, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants Association, said the cost of many vegetables was beginning to dip this week. Several vegetables such as carrots and beans that were costlier were now priced at least 20 % lower now.We expect prices tocome down further once the Tamil month Aadi started in a few days. The cost of tomatoes too would stabilise in a week or ten days. Arrivals to the market would improve.

I had stumbled upon the name while surfing the net. It sounded good, for on the menu were all kinds of interesting sandwiches and pasta dishes. But the problem was that I just couldnt find it.The address was 39 Meharchand Market. I found No. 39, but that was not an eatery. I walked up the stairs and knocked at a door, and found it locked. I came down, asked some peoplemost of whom were clueless. Then a good Samaritan asked me to try the back entry through a small lane behind the shops lining the main market. I followed the directions, and luckily found a small sticker that told me I was on the right track. I followed the sign, walked up a steep flight of stairsand finally I was in CJs Fresh.Interesting menuCJs Fresh is a take-away which does deliveries (Phone: 9910501234; email: fresh@cjsfresh.com). Run by a young lady called Chahat Jain, it has an interesting menuwith sandwiches, pasta, pizzas, burgers, fries, milkshakes and desserts. I had done my research, so I knew what I wanted even before I landed up there. I had seen a picture of a bowl of pasta with juicy pieces of bacon on it, so that was on top of my list. Then we had decided to have a vegetable sandwich, and a meaty one.The formercalled Getting Grilled (Rs. 280), comprised eggplant, zucchini, mushroom, cherry tomatoes, rocket leaves, smoked cheese, herbs and CJs secret sauce. The Ham and Cheddar Affiliation (Rs. 349 ) had roasted ham and melted cheddar cheese with aioli and herbs. The Carbonara Crewfor Rs. 349was a bacon, cheese and pasta dish.I got talking to a lady at the counter, and heard that the place was started by her daughter just four months ago. She had studied in the US, and had returned to India full of food plans. She now wants to start an outlet near Chhattarpur.It should prosper, for the sandwiches were excellent. The pasta was superb, creamy and cheesy, as Carbonara is meant to be, and the bacon pieces were juicy and plump and fried just right. I had asked for a wheat pasta preparation, so I felt quite healthydespite all the rich bits that had gone in itwhen I was done with it.Secret sauceThe sandwiches (grilled panini, focaccia or multigrain) were soft and full of goodies. The fillings were fresh, and the cheese had oozed nicely into the ham-and-cheddar sandwich. The veggie one had a burst of flavourswith rockets and cherry tomatoes complementing the smoothness of the smoked cheese. I dont know what their secret sauce is (its secret, so I didnt ask), but it certainly gave a zing to the sandwich.I am quite a burger fiend, so I want to try out CJs burgers one of these days. The descriptions sound good: Twisty Aloo Burger (Rs. 279) has a potato filling with mint mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomatoes, sauted onions and cheddar cheese; the Pork Pack (Rs. 379) consists of pulled pork tossed in sweet chipotle, pickled black olives and mozzarella and Gangsta Lamb (Rs. 399) has a lamb patty topped with a three cheese blend, pine nuts, caramelised onions, lettuce and herbs, in a special hung curd dip.The lady insisted that I try out a slice of their fresh cheesecake. I agreed, and found it delicious, though I thought it was somewhere in between a cheesecake and a souffl. The Cheesecake Monopoly is for Rs. 210, and they have, among other things, a peanut butter and white chocolate cookie coalition (Rs. 120 for two) and Mos Nutella Fried Oreos (Rs. 150 for 5 pieces).I like young people with big dreams, and hope their dreams all come to true. The secret sauce should do its bit."

Bullied by the Dragon on the east, who constantly threatens war on the flimsiest of grounds. Pestered by the eternal enemy to the west, who is emboldened by the support it receives from the Dragon as well as by its impending victory in Afghanistan.India has a friend in Israel. Other than that, it really doesnt have a friend in the world. But Israel has its own constraints. It is too small. It makes great arms, but of the bits-and-pieces kind. Befriending Israel has allowed India to get on the right side of the influential American Jewish community.And we should close our market to American goods unless and until Trump sees sense on the H-1B front. Enough of flaky diplomacy. Its time for realpolitik. Enough of having had our eyes glaze over by the allure of America. Russia may not be nearly as cool, but it will come to our aid in times of crisis like America never will.But Americas Jews have been unable to prevent America from dumping Israel for Iran. Israel became livid with Obama. But Trump is honouring the Iran deal. And then Israel craves recognition from its enemies, many Muslim nations. Already the Saudis are buddies with Israel. What happens if they recognize Israel, and then Pakistan follows suit?In any case, Israel is too small, too besieged, too far away from India to come to our aid in any substantive fashion in case of a conflict with the Dragon.If the conflict with the Dragon explodes into anything more than a mere skirmish, expect the eternal enemy to jump into the fray. Pakistans media is eerily silent on the friction between us and the Dragon. Now that the generals are fully in charge of the country, they are not going to sit idle in opening a second front. It would represent a dream opportunity for them.So what should we do? Just follow what the expert of realpolitik, Indira Gandhi, did. Kiss and make up with the Russians. Boris Yeltsin admittedly was openly derisive of India. That made Messrs. Rao, Vajpayee, and Manmohan, turn by turn, spurn the Russians for the allure of the US.But what has true friendship with the US got us? Empty platitudes such as natural allies, strategic partners, and little else. Sure we got the nuclear deal, but the Americans, just because their own reactors are defunct and outdated, keep pushing more and more liability down our throats.Trump came to power promising to curb H-1Bs and launch a trade war with China. He has done none of the latter, but has gone after H-1Bs with full force. H-1Bs constitute our major export to the US. Today we have Heinz tomato sauce instead of the earlier-perfectly delicious Kisan, Lays potato chips instead of Indian versions, and Coca Cola and Pepsi instead of Thums Up and Campa Cola.American goods have flooded India, and keep flooding in more and more. India has an upper middle and elite class of 150 million which can afford anything that the 100 million American middle and upper class can. America is saturated as a market. India represents a new America to the Americans. Thats why they drool all over us with idle lip-service.America has not got us what we want  a UN permanent seat. Nor have the British and the French. Yet we keep buying major arms and goods from them. We should close our markets to them unless and until they get us the UN seat. Even so, they will not come to our aid in case of conflict with our neighbours.Thats where Vladimir Putin and Indira Gandhi come in. Putin has been cold to India. He is miffed at us for abandoning him for the West. But Leonid Brezhnev was no easy customer. And Indira was able to bear hug him to save us from the Americans.Our first port of call for any major arms supply should be the Russians. We should consider signing a treaty of friendship and eternal cooperation with them just as Indira did. The effect on the Chinese will be immediatethey will back off. We should buy arms from the West only if the Russians cannot supply them to us.And we should close our market to American goods unless and until Trump sees sense on the H-1B front. Enough of flaky diplomacy. Its time for realpolitik. Enough of having had our eyes glaze over by the allure of America. Russia made not be nearly as cool, but it will come to our aid in times of crisis like America never will.Lets just do what Indira did in 1971 and made India proud of her. By doing so, we will make her proud of us."
5a0b57fb9855b76bf13ce67f,Maximum support  maximum price,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/maximum-support-maximum-price/article19281962.ece,2017-07-15,,The Hindu,"Under the onion skin:The journey shows one thing  that farming, which sustains more than half of Indias population even if many of them also do other things on the side for supplementary income, is not a lucrative proposition. (Above and three-column image below) Pictures show the Sardar wholesale agricultural market, in Surat, Gujarat.R.V. MoorthyR_V_MoorthyIt is past noon and the Sardar wholesale agricultural market in Surat is bustling with activity. Trucks drive in every minute and so do lorries smaller in size. Farmers arrive in these with loads of agricultural produce to sell. The place has multiple rows of platforms interspersed with streets and parking spots. Each platform is dedicated to different kinds of produce: onion, fruits, vegetables, etc. Things move with clockwork precision. Daily-wage labourers offload the sacks of farm produce from trucks, dumping them in huge heaps on the floor of the platforms. A different set of merchants buys this grain and transports it from here, to be sold in towns nearby. The merchants registered here who act as conduits for the sale take a 6% commission on the produce sold. The rest goes to the farmer, and is delivered in cash on the second or fourth day.This correspondent  who accompanied the ongoing yatra of farmers organisations from Madhya Pradesh to Delhi through parts of Maharashtra and Gujarat  took a detour to talk to people at this wholesale market to make sense of agricultural marketing operations.Ebb and flow of pricesThe place is a market seeing daily fluctuations of prices, based on demand and supply. If a greater quantity of a crop comes to the market on a given day and fewer merchants land up to buy it, the price falls. If more merchants come and there is dearth of a commodity, the price rises. Farmers benefit from a higher price and return disappointed if the prices are low. The prices fluctuate even within a day. To sell for a good price is like being lucky in a draw of lots.Rakesh Bhambre and Sunil Sonone, who have driven down in a rented truck from Daswel village of the Baglan taluka in Nashik district of Maharashtra, have had a hectic day. They arrived here at 2 a.m. Through the morning, they have sold their onions, which were harvested in April, and have managed to get a price of Rs. 6-7 per kg, which is not bad. They will now head back to their village in a bit. The merchant will send them the money for their produce in cash two days from now, which another truck coming from their village will deliver to them.The two Nashik farmers say they engage only in farming and have no side work to do. Their annual calendar is hectic. In June/July and October, they sow sugar cane, which requires a lot of water and takes close to nine months to be ready. This year isnt a good one for sugar cane, they fear, as it isnt raining yet. They sow onion in August and also in November. They have brought the harvest of their November crop of onion here, they say. The advantage with onion is that it can also be stored for four-five months.They also sow tomato in June and July, and the crop takes two months to be ready.The agricultural process requires a variety of expenses. They need to buy seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and machines on hire for harvesting. They have to pay the bills for power consumed while watering their fields. They also need to hire labour for various operations, from preparing the fields, taking care of the crop to loading the produce on to trucks. Labour charges range from Rs. 70-100 a day.These expenses  varying for different crops  are facilitated both by the money they get by selling their previous produce in the market and by borrowing from cooperative banks, nationalised banks and regional rural banks at an interest of around 7%. Sometimes, they have to borrow from private merchants too, at a higher rate of interest on a monthly basis. Most farmers are under debt of a few lakhs, and sometimes borrow from one lender to pay another. A good crop and remunerative prices  a matter of chance  can lead to better incomes. A slump in prices of a crop or erratic monsoon can lead to loss.The variegated world of farmersThis year, farmers in Nimaad region of Madhya Pradesh and in adjoining parts of Maharashtra  like Nashik and Ahmednagar  are still awaiting rains. If it does not rain for another week, they say, their crops will be damaged. Villages, of course, have farmers of varying means. The richer ones have more land  perhaps 20 acres  and can try three or four kinds of crops in their fields. If one fails, they believe the other will not. The smaller farmers find it harder to get by.The truck in which Bhambre and Sonone brought their produce to Surat has been hired from a bigger farmer of their village, who owns trucks and hires them out.These two farmers  each owning 7-8 acres of land  however spend the year in farming, both with their family labour and hired daily wagers. The poorest in villages own no land of their own, and work on the fields of others.The wealthier farmers have also diversified into related occupations and other businesses as an additional cushion, as farming is not very lucrative and yields and prices are unpredictable. The poorest in the agricultural world either work others fields or do additional work as rickshaw pullers, construction workers, etc., sometimes becoming poor migrants. Hours before reaching the Surat market, this correspondent visited Koribhartna village near Surat, where daily wagers were working the fields of a richer farmer where okra was being grown. Dinesh, a daily-wage labourer of the village with no land of his own, said he works through the year at a daily wage of Rs. 100. He gets one or the other agricultural work through the year, he says, but adds that the money he earns is not enough for maintaining his family well.Pandane village in Nashik district is situated close to a dam from where it gets what villagers complain is sand-laced water. Pradip Shivaji Chitte, whose joint family has 7.5-acres of land, of which he works on just 2.5, has opened a small shop dealing in seeds, fertilisers and pesticides. He rented this shop two months ago in a bid to diversify beyond farming. I invested Rs. 1 lakh in this; some of my friends also contributed, he says. But till now, I am just being able to break even. Chitte says he is under Rs. 16-lakh debt and practises grape farming in the village. In our village, half the farming is grape farming; the rest is of all other crops, he says.Just preparing the fields for the crops entails a labour charge of Rs. 20,000 per acre, he claims. The fields are prepared from September and the harvest comes only by January, before which the crop requires a lot of care. The total expense, including labour, fertilisers and pesticides, comes to Rs. 1.6-1.7 lakh per acre. The selling of the produce begins from January and it sells at about Rs. 18-25 per kg. If one subtracts the expense borne from the selling price per acre, the profit is Rs. 45,000-50,000. This is the annual income for growing grapes per acre. Chitte says bigger farmers aiming at exports prepare their fields a month earlier  they also get higher prices when they sell their produce, he adds.Farmers in the Nimaad region of Madhya Pradesh also grow hybrid crops like Bt cotton.The same is the case in neighbouring districts of Maharashtra like Nashik. Jagdish Patidar, who came to Barwani for a day from Maheshwar in Madhya Pradesh to take part in the ongoing rally of farmers organisations, says he too grows Bt cotton, which requires more supply of water and higher input costs. What they look for is higher prices for their produce.Bt cotton costs more but is high yield and therefore more lucrative for farmers. When a new variety that is advertised as high yield comes, farmers will take to it for profits, says Lakhwinder Singh, an agriculture expert at Punjabi University, Patiala. Many farmers also took to it as it was advertised as resistant to bollworm, a pest that affected cotton. However, Singh cautions, the pest resistance is only for three-four years.Agitations and farmers yatraThe ongoing farmers agitations are demanding state support for making farming more lucrative. They demand that the M.S. Swaminathan Committees recommendation  that the government-announced minimum support price (MSP) should be 1.5-times the cost of production  be implemented. They are also demanding farm loan waiver, as many farmers are under large debt. However, a loan waiver does not ease the burden of loans taken from private parties.Till July 14, a Kisan Mukti Yatra involving several farmers organisations has been moving through Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, addressing villagers and articulating these demands. The participants argue that while input costs for farming have been rising, the rise in MSP has been sluggish.Swaraj Abhiyan leader and academic Yogendra Yadav, Narmada Bachao Andolan leader Medha Patkar, Maharashtra farmer leader Raju Shetti, the All India Kisan Sabha, Kisan Sangharsh Morcha, Bhartiya Kisan Union of Punjab, and other organisations are taking part in the yatra, which will converge on Jantar Mantar in Delhi on July 18. It began in Madhya Pradesh, with the farmers leaders being detained for a few hours by the police, and passed through Indore, Barwani  visiting village Barda, which is in the submergence zone of the Sardar Sarovar dam  Nashik, Vyara and Surat in Gujarat, Bhilwara and Jaipur in Rajasthan, among other places. There are regular halts to interact with people, with crowds varying from a few hundred to a few thousand turning up.The yatra comes close on the heels of the deaths of six farmers in police action in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, and a strike by Maharashtra farmers early in June, when they decided to let their farm produce and milk perish but not sell it in the absence of lucrative prices. The strike was broken in 48 hours after talks with the Maharashtra government, which made a few announcements: loan waivers for small and debt-ridden farmers; a Bill to criminalise buying produce at rates below the MSP; the setting up of a State Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices on the lines of the Centre to look into MSP issues. The State government also offered to subsidise farmers power bills, hike milk prices and set up cold storage chains for preserving the produce.Making farming sustainableThe journey shows one thing  that farming, which sustains more than half of Indias population even if many of them also do other things on the side for supplementary income, is not a lucrative proposition. Farmlands have become smaller over generations and, except for large farmers, many do not find it rewarding but find themselves ill-trained for other occupations, says Patidar, the farmer from Maheshwar. Farmers, however, do have an emotional attachment to farming.Their fortunes depend on many things: rains, prevailing prices, and how indebted they become. Lakhwinder Singh says that the answer to the agrarian unease is either subsidies on input costs or higher prices. He says farmers need to spend not just on farming but also on services like education and health. Unless their expenses go down or incomes go up, discontent is expected, he adds. Everything from health and education to seeds that were public services once are private services now. Farmers get into this loop of rising costs of living, he explains.In Punjab, the government purchases all wheat and rice crops at the MSP. This, being scientifically calculated, can enable farmers to have some incomes that make agriculture meaningful. But the same procurement guarantee applies neither to all crops nor to all States, which makes farming less lucrative as an occupation, says Lakhwinder Singh.Farmers in Madhya Pradesh say that government procurement centres are opened late, often a month and a half after a crop is ready. But farmers cannot store it all in their fields near their homes. They try to sell their crop soon after harvest to merchants, and often get prices below the MSP. If government centres were to start as soon as the harvest came, we would get better prices, says Patidar.The troubles dont end here. Patidar says not all the produce is bought by these centres; it may be rejected on grounds of quality. Suraj, a young farmer from Naraula village in Barwani district, says that there is much paperwork in these centres to ascertain the quantity of land on which the crop was sown, the yield, and to verify that the produce indeed belongs to the farmer who brought it.Unless there is a procurement guarantee and the farmer can count on the government to purchase his produce, the MSP has little meaning on the ground, says former Maharashtra State Planning Commission member and economist H.M. Desarda. Lakhwinder Singh adds that if the government undertakes to purchase all major crops at the MSP, farmers will be better off.But will this not push prices of farm produce bought by consumers upward? Lakhwinder Singh disagrees. He says the large number of middlemen in the supply chain do not anyway let vegetable and grain prices reflect the prices at which farmers are selling them. The long-term answer to farmers indebtedness, he adds, is a rise in their incomes.It may become a heated debate politically, but an answer to non-remunerative farming may take longer to come.Unless there is a procurement guarantee and the farmer can count on the government to purchase his produce, the MSP has little meaning on the ground,H.M.

The Centres role was limited to linking spot market to future market, reforms in essential commodities Act and bolstering food storage and processing sectors.When tomato was being sold at Rs. 7 a kg in A.P., it was sold at Rs. 50 a kg in Kerala the same day. Why are our State markets not integrated. Why cant we have better shelf life for vegetables and fruits. We need to remove restrictions on agriculture market and invite competition between markets, he said.Dr. Chand said a good number of SDGs were directly related to agriculture such as reducing poverty, zero hunger and sustainable use of water.While a new State would tend to grow faster and Telangana apparently was on the right track, it should quickly learn from mistakes of the other States which compromised long-term goals in favour of the short-term ones.He said over-exploitation of water and excessive use of chemical fertilizers would be the pinching factors. Our crop patterns should be linked to water availability. The States should look at different zones and decide on crops that are suitable to specific zones, he said.On decreasing income of farmers, he said though the income might not have risen in 2014-15 and 2015-16, the long-term data showed that the income accruing to the farmers was rising at three % a year. But that was not enough to meet the growing needs and aspirations for better education and health when the rest of the economy was growing at seven to eight %.Unless the farmers income was supplemented by non-farm sources, the agrarian distress would not be alleviated, he said."

And most of the crop, apparently, is withering away though the government says crop in only 7,300 acres is under stress.According to official figures, more than 3.4 lakh farmers seem to have left agriculture for good while the quantum of seed distributed has gone down by over 50%  3.44 lakh quintals  to todays 3.32 lakh quintals.From a high of 5.69 lakh quintals being distributed and 6.32 lakh farmers benefiting in 2009, it went to a low of just over 1.24 lakh quintals and 1.39 lakh farmers in 2014.After slowly regaining some ground in 2015 and 2016, backed by the governments promise of farm loan waiver and the ambitious promise of driving away drought by ensuring a successful crop in every acre through a combination of farm ponds and rain guns, the numbers have started to dwindle again.From the dismal lows of 2014, seed distribution rose by 73.98% (year on year) and the number of beneficiaries by 71.75% in 2015. The next year too registered a 43.6% and 37.5% increase in the quantum of seed distributed and beneficiaries respectively.However, it fell to a 7.1% growth (year on year over 2016) to 3.32 lakh quintals seed distributed and registered a negative growth rate of 17.72% in the number of beneficiaries this year.Given the fact that the acreage of alternative crops  castor, cotton and others including that of perennial crops (mostly horticulture) hasnt crossed the 70,000-hectare mark in any of the past years, it can safely be assumed that well over at least five lakh farmers are not taking to agriculture at all and around five lakh hectares are being left fallow for the better part of the last decade.I have left 15 of my 19 acres fallow this year out. Last year, I cultivated groundnut in the entire area and faced utter failure and debts. So, I shifted to tomato in four acres as it too has fluctuating fortunes at best, said Pulla Reddy, a farmer from the Anantapur rural mandal.Several lakhs of farmers seem to have made similar choices. The rise in the migration of people every year is but mirroring the grave crisis in the agrarian sector.Several farmers are choosing to move away from agriculture as it has become an experiment year after year. Confidence needs to be instilled in the farmers by bringing water for irrigation usage is the only answer, Peddireddy of the Andhra Pradesh Rythu Sangham told The Hindu ."

5a0b5e999855b76bf13ceb0f,Taming inflationary expectations,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/taming-inflationary-expectations/article19338912.ece,2017-07-24,,The Hindu,"The official inflation rate dipped to 1.5% last month, the lowest in almost two decades. Inflation is a politically more sensitive challenge than joblessness for the simple reason that it affects everyone, whether you have a job or not.Indias long-term record in managing inflation has been very impressive when compared with most developing countries. We have never had the bouts of hyperinflation experienced in many Latin American economies or seen even in countries such as Israel. The relatively high double-digit inflation experienced between 2010 to 2013 was an aberration, which had a political consequence. There have been very few instances of such persistent, multi-year, high inflationary episodes in our history. The credit for this goes to the vigilance of the political system and also to effective monetary management. Inflation is after all a monetary phenomenon  more money chasing fewer goods. So, controlling money supply is part of the strategy for controlling inflation.Food prices as indicatorBut inflation is also an indicator of whether there is an excess demand or supply of goods. For instance, with a bumper crop of fruits and vegetables, prices plunge, even though money supply might be unchanged. Indeed, the recent drop in the inflation rate has been caused by a steep fall in the prices of vegetables (-17%) and pulses (- 22%). Conversely, and rather ironically, unseasonal rains in the north have destroyed a large part of the tomato crop causing prices to skyrocket. Food prices, especially of perishables, are notoriously volatile. High onion prices, even if temporary, have caused the downfall of governments in past elections. Food prices are a big component in the determinant of the overall inflation rate based on the consumer price index basket. Keeping them low and stable involves policies such as public procurement and a minimum support price regime. Inflation control thus involves a combination of monetary management along with measures to increase supply of goods (in the medium term) as also anti-hoarding measures or the release of stocks from government warehouses.Even though price stability is an important goal of government policy, it is now an exclusive mandate given to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Last year, in a landmark reform of monetary management, the government officially gave an inflation target to the RBI. Prior to this, the central bank had multiple objectives which included enhancing growth and reducing unemployment, although price stability was undoubtedly paramount. The new paradigm, called the flexible inflation targeting framework, aims for a numerical target given by the government. The main tool to achieve it is by setting the benchmark interest rate. This decision is now taken by the six-member monetary policy committee (MPC), chaired by the Governor. The current inflation target is 4% plus or minus 2%. The MPC is deemed to have failed if for three consecutive quarters the inflation rate falls outside the band.Low inflation pointerWho would have imagined that in the new MPC regime, the first instance of deviation of the inflation rate would undershoot, not overshoot the target? Of course, technically, the MPC has not failed, for the June inflation rate of 1.5%, which is below 2%, may be transitory. However, there are strong indications and forecasts by many economists that point to low inflation in the coming months. Those numbers may be in the range of 2 to 4%.How did we get to this low inflation scenario? Partly it must be because the money supply has been kept dear, or tight. Thus, the benchmark rate (called the repo rate, or the rate at which the RBI gives money to banks) at 6.25% may be too high. Interest rates are the price of money, so if they are too high, money becomes scarce. If it is lowered, then there will be more money in circulation, more loans given out. But low inflation is also because of a steep fall in prices of fruits, vegetables and pulses, none of which was caused by high interest rates. These steep falls are highly seasonal. We have also benefited from low and stable crude oil prices, which are a crucial determinant of transport and energy costs.All eyes will now be on the MPC which meets again in less than two weeks. There is a strong feeling that high interest rates have deterred big industrial investments, or housing finance. High rates are crippling borrowers who try to come out of near-bankruptcy and are preventing a restructuring of stressed bank loans. Indias real interest rates, i.e. net of inflation, are quite high even compared to other developing countries. Much of the developed world has ultra-low rates, with some countries such as Sweden, Switzerland and Japan even having negative interest rates. India needs much lower rates for higher GDP growth.But the job of the MPC wont be easy. This is mainly because its task is to target future inflation, not the past. The future has some troubling portents. The short run impact of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is bound to be inflationary. Thats because a bulk of Indias GDP is in services whose tax rate has moved from 15% to 18%. Besides, while sellers wait for their refund, i.e. input tax credit under the GST, their cost of capital locked up might go up. Many State governments have introduced additional levies to counter their apprehension of a loss of revenue under the GST. Besides the GST, there is the impact of the award of the Seventh Pay Commission to government employees. This effect will cascade to public sector organisations and State-level employees as well, and put pressure on prices. A third factor could be the loan waivers announced in some States which can cause fiscal stress. High deficit spending is not compatible with lower interest rates. A fourth factor is the uptick in commodity prices worldwide as metals and food prices are looking up.The last, and probably the most important, factor weighing on the MPCs mind would be inflation expectations. Household surveys conducted by the RBI indicate that people are expecting inflation to be close to 10% , not the 1.5% as is reported now. You may say that these expectations are irrational, but they do affect behaviour. In this season of salary increments, try giving someone a raise of 2%, as is common in the developed world. Workers will howl. Even their official dearness allowance is much higher. The real challenge is to slay this inflation expectations monster. In much of the western world, they are fighting disinflation if not outright deflation. But in India we are still struggling with inflationary conditions and expectations.In English the verb for inflation is inflate. It refers to rising prices. But in most Indian languages, the equivalent word in usage is  mehengaai , which refers to affordability and cost of living. Not all inflation is unwelcome. So if stock prices go up, that is good cheer. But  mehengaai  is hated by all. A low and stable inflation rate is a perquisite for sustained high economic growth. Mehengaai is antithetical to it. In the medium term, the growth impact of the GST, the improving ease of doing business  and hence increasing supply of goods  and a strong domestic currency, will all help keep inflation low.

But their efforts fell through as they could not get credit without providing non-agricultural assets as collateral guarantee, pointed out Executive Director G.V. Ramanjaneyulu of Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (CSA).The 30% tax on farmers cooperative societies was a big dampener and just like the IT sector, there should be a tax holiday for farmers cooperative societies to get them into the market system, he suggested, at a recent workshop on Bangaru Telangana and Sustainable Development Goals attended by government officials and agriculture experts.While the proposed Rs. 4,000 financial assistance per acre to be extended to farmers by the Telangana government was welcome, it would do well to adopt Karnatakas model of having a State-level price mechanism to compensate farmers if prices fell below the floor price. Meagre farm incomes as against rising cost of living, lack of support systems for credit access or for marketing the produce, high cost of production and no commensurate support prices have resulted in growing debt burden and farmers suicides, observed Dr. Ramanjaneyulu.The government, which brought out agricultural action plans, should also be submitting review reports and data related to how many farmers got the credit and minimum support price etc., should be kept in the public domain. And, when prices of vegetables like tomato suffer wide variations from Rs. 1 a kg to Rs. 100 a kg, States should not brook delay in pushing for one country, one market to benefit both farmers and consumers.Farmers have been cultivating only three to four main crop varieties across all areas increasing the risk factor as all areas would not be suitable for all crops, therefore cropping pattern changes has to be crucial. For instance, cotton being cultivated in 40 lakh acres this season could be a risky proposition. Same goes with paddy, a water intensive crop, he says.Dr. Ramanjeyalu also alludes to the fact that TS accounted for the highest fertiliser consumption in the country which means the farmers cost of production has only increased even as the soil health took a hit."

How I came to write about food most of the time these days is a story for another time.But what I realized when I started to write this piece is that the foundations of becoming a food writer were laid down all those years ago.Everyday lunches were about discovering those hidden places in the Gandhinagar area close to my then office. I was a lone lady with a bunch of guys with ravenous appetites and a sense of adventure. And so I discovered the joys of a Jolada Rotti meal one day at a restaurant hidden deep inside a residential area. I've stood in line in front of a tiny place in Seshadripuram for mutton pulav that would be unceremoniously slapped onto a plate and handed to you. You jostled with people crowding the pavement to eat since there was no real place to stand or sit. I also did the rounds of most military hotels in the Majestic region, much before they came into their own today among food enthusiasts. I remember sitting in the midst of all my protective colleagues who wanted me to eat my donne biryani and mutton fry unmindful of all those eyes ogling at a denim clad lady in their midst. I discovered the joys of those Andhra meals and spicy biryanis with these guys too. And during those early morning shoot shifts, breakfasts made of crispy vadas, buttery dosas and sinful idli sambars, complete with a dollop of ghee were mine! These were at places well-known and some so hole-in-the-wall, that you would think people in the know joked of their existence. It was such a way of life that almost every conversation at the end of morning tea at office would center round where we would go for lunch! Discovering the joys of Bengaluru's food scene continued well into my next job - which was as a features journalist. This time, office was close to VV Puram Food Street which made the team actually look forward to those late production nights - steaming masala paddus, gobi manchurian rolls, MLA pesarattu, floating pani poori, gulkhand with fruits, those sinful aloo bajjis and endless cups of chai. Our office boy should have been awarded an honorary degree in journalism for his ability to take orders from everyone and bring them in flawlessly each time. Having a child led me down the freelance path of work and this was a time when I got fed up of doing work based on briefs from other people. I wanted to do something for myself and blogging had just started to be on people's radar. Realizing that I loved to discover new eating places, I started writing about restaurants and eateries.Bengaluru just began moving away from multi cuisine restaurants and began opening up to single cuisine formats. I still remember a lovely place in Koramangala that served only dimsums, much before the current trend of single-dish restaurants came up. Another happy memory is of making my own bruschetta with fresh basil, cherry tomatoes and olive oil served on a platter at an Italian restaurant. Or that time when a friend introduced us to the Laham Mandi, an Arabic version of the biryani served in a basement restaurant in a nondescript corner of Queens Road.With my blog gaining momentum, so did interesting food experiences that came my way - from a meal made entirely from edible flowers, to an Izakaya styled Japanese meal with a live sushi counter, robatayaki and for those on the run - the Bento Box.Gastropubs gave us the first taste of souped-up pub grub - from dirty fries to pierogies to biryani burritos to loaded jacket potatoes and more. Brewpubs had everyone waiting for those seasonal brews to make an appearance, besides the regular favourites. Gourmet coffee cafes are now sprouting, where you can decide on the roast level of your coffee... the scene has never been so vibrant and this is just the tip of the iceberg.Today, I can get myself a nice wine paired (Indian and international mind you) meal, just as easily as I can get sushi, beef carpaccio, ceviche, sour beef and truffle infused just-about-anything.Bengaluru, like the rest of the country is bringing the best of regional Indian cuisine to the fore as well - and so Chettinad, Malabari, Bohri, Punjabi, Rajasthani and more are ours for the grabbing.Indian food, with and without a twist; food served in rickshaws, swings, pressure cookers and ferris wheels . Drinks served in everything found in a science lab Bengaluru has been there, done that and is now coming full circle! Millets are gaining momentum, farm to fork is on the rise, home cooks are setting up pop-ups of regional cuisines that may be lost to posterity , and food is going back to being all about just that good wholesome food.And the best part - I am still eating my way through it all!"

Today, thanks to less production and greater demand, the average rate is Rs 80 a kilo and even an unprecedented Rs 100 is not unheard of.""While there are tomato varieties of lower quality which cost around Rs 80 in the local markets, the best ones are being sold even at Rs 110 per kg,"" says S Siraj Ahmed, a vegetable merchant in Russell Market.The reasons for the spike in prices are not hard to find at the Agricultural Produce and Marketing Committee (APMC) premises at Kolar headquarters, Asia's second largest tomato market. Traders and APMC officials at the yard and farmers in the surrounding villages agree that a combination of a dip in tomato production this season and a sudden rise in the demand for Kolar tomatoes from other states has led to rocketing prices.Kolar APMC secretary T S Ravi Kumar said tomato production in the region had gradually gone down in the past few months due to various reasons  less rain, low pricing and increased temperatures which decreases the yield. ""The supply we receive at the APMC during this season has gone down by 50% compared with last year. At this juncture, the demand for stocks has also gone up from some of the north Indian states where the production has come to a standstill due to flooding and other reasons. As the stocks have become limited, the price of tomatoes has gone up,"" he said.""The price is expected to remain the same or go up further till local production in other states picks up,"" said Toheed Pasha, a trader.Located around 70km from Bengaluru, Kolar headquarters is next only to the tomato market in Maharashtra's Nashik. Apart from Bengaluru, which receives a good chunk of tomatoes from here, the stocks are sold regularly to parts of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and some north Indian states as well. Traders also take tomato loads from here and supply to Bangladesh and Pakistan, among other countries.Kolar a tomato hotspotSrikanth C R from CMR Mandi (primary assembly market) at the Kolar APMC said the best of tomatoes land here from the various taluks in Kolar as well as from surrounding districts like Chikkaballapura, Bengaluru Rural, Mandya, Tumakuru and Chitradurga. ""By good quality, we mean uniform size, required hardness, shining and original red colour in the yield. This is the reason why traders from different parts of the country prefer tomatoes from here. Farmers from neighbouring Ananthpur and Chittoor districts of Andhra Pradesh come here to sell tomatoes as they can get a good number of traders,"" he said."

The skies open up and he pulls a plastic sheet over his head, wondering if he will be working at a petrol pump by this time next year. This isn't a story of urbanisation but of a murder convict being given a shot at reintegration into society.Harilal (name changed) is among a bunch of 24 convicts who have been farming at Thane's open prison . If a proposal made by the prison authorities is accepted by the state government, eight of them could be working as attendants at a petrol pump and car washing centre to be set up in the open prison premises. Prison authorities have written to government-owned oil companies for information about requirements for setting up fuel dispensing units. The open prison at Thane, spread across 20 acres, began operating three years ago. It is the only open prison in Mumbai metropolitan region where convicts can work with no boundary walls. The selection process and eligibility criteria are carefully laid down to choose only the best cases fit for transfer to an open prison. For instance, a committee looks at a con vict's behaviour inside the prison and whether at least a third of his sentence has be en completed. For every ye ar spent in the open prison, the convict get a remission of 13 months in his sentence. But if he is caught fleeing, he would be sent back to the prison and lose his privileges.At Thane's open prison, the largely grey-haired bunch of convicts cultivate land under the watchful eye of an instructor and prison guards.The produce is sold to other prisons. Between April 2016 and March 2017, the Thane facility earned a revenue of Rs 13.4 lakh from the sale of farm produce. ""The group of convicts is involved in every stage of production--from sowing to reaping. We have a tractor and 18 cattle. All kinds of vegetables are grown: tomatoes, brinjals, lady's finger and leafy vegetables like spinach. But during monsoon, we only grow rice,"" the instructor told TOI. After the day's work is over, the convicts return to their barracks within the prison.There are some patches of land that are not under cultivation. It is on one such patch that the authorities plan to instal two fuel units and operate a petrol pump. ""Motorists riding on the stretch from Thane central jail to Rabodi could re fuel their vehicles here. The cash collection will be handled by prison guards. Two convicts would operate a fuel-dispensing unit each and six others would work at an adjacent car wash centre--if things go as per plan,"" said Nitin Vayachal, superintendent, Thane prison. This would be the first time the convicts would interact with the public while still in incarceration; so far their interaction was limited to jail staff.""Open prisons are a good innovation to decongest prisons and facilitate rehabilitation process while the prisoner is still serving a sentence.A step further is open colonies where the prisoner stays in quarters with his family , goes out to farm and sells the produce on his own. He has to be back by a particular time, else it would be regarded as an escape.Prisons in Sangli, Jaipur, etc, have open colonies,"" said Dr Vijay Raghavan, professor, Centre for Criminology and Justice, TISS. Open prisons are only available for prisoners who have been awarded a life sentence or a very long term. ""As to whether society would accept a convict working in their midst, it would depend on the nature of offence committed.Where a murder was a result of circumstances such as land dispute or family dispute and the convict admits he did it in the heat of the moment, it won't attract the same stigma as a case of rape would,"" added Dr Raghavan.The main objective of the penal system being reformation, it is praiseworthy that Thane prison has a plan to ease the shift for convicts after a life of incarceration. The big challenge of the justice system is to prevent an individual from sliding back into a life of crime after a jail term. Criminal recidivism is as high as 60% even in developed countries.Teaching new skills is one way to stem the tide."

An Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) official told TOI that demand for French beans dips in the rainy season."" Because of that, supplies to the markets also come down. Excessive rains tend to affect some crops adversely,"" he said.Yakub Pathan, owner of the Fresh Vegetable Market in Wakad, said French bean prices have been on an upswing for about a month now.""Before Friday, French beans were sold at Rs60 per kg in the retail market. On Friday however, the price doubled, to Rs120 per kg. On Friday, the wholesale markets had no supply of French Beans, which caused the prices to rise,"" Pathan said of the situation.Tomatoes too are being sold between Rs80 and Rs100 in most retail markets. Kailash Kolhe, a vegetable vendor in Koregaon Park, said, ""We buy tomatoes from wholesalers at Rs70 per kg, and sell them at Rs80 per kg. Intense rain spells in tomato growing regions is ruining the crop, apart from making the harvested tomatoes pale in colour,"" Kolhe said. With 50% less supply of tomatoes in the market, the cost of tomatoes has continued to spiral upwards in the last few weeks. With less availability of tomatoes, the prices will continue to remain this way, stated sources from APMC.However, improved production is supposed to bring down tomato prices from mid-August and September.According to sources in the market, during last month's farmers' strike, many tillers had destroyed their standing crop as they were not sure how long the strike would go on for. Incessant rains too played spoilsport, bringing down production. However, the APMC hopes that things would improve and markets would normalize by August.Dilip Khire of Pune APMC added that incessant rains had damaged tomato crops and supply from farmers had depleted, which had caused the prices to rise over the last two months. Gadhve said that Narayangaon, which is one of the largest tomato suppliers, was seeing only 25% supply in the last two months.""There are about 70-80 villages in Narayangaon that supply tomatoes. With less production, we are only getting 200 metric tonne instead of 800 metric tonne of tomatoes during the same period last year,"" he said. He further added that the tomatoes coming from North India, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka have reduced.Meanwhile, vegetable vendor Nanasaheb Awate from NIBM Road said that since the wholesale prices of tomatoes had gone up, he can no longer afford to buy it, and so stopped stocking the vegetable at his stall.""The prices of all vegetables increased during the monsoon and tomatoes are practically impossible to get. For the last three days, my vegetable vendor has not been keeping tomatoes at his stall, so I've not been able to buy,"" said working professional Nina Shah."

Farmers cultivate the crops for almost 10 months, while treatment of land is conducted in two months, he said.Another farmer Janeswar Sahoo said earlier, market linkage was a problem, but with the construction of all-weather roads, vegetable dealers are buying the produce from the agriculture field after harvest. It is our source of livelihood and all family members are engaged in farming. We sell the vegetables to the buyers of Bhubaneswar, Athagarh, Cuttack , Dhenkanal and Angul, he added.They said some scientists from National Water Management came to the village and guided the farmers on proper use of natural stream water and better farming. Though it is not sufficient, farmers demanded more land near the agriculture fields, Government support to promote organic farming and micro irrigation facilities.The success stories of farmers, who reaped benefits from channelising stream water and organic farming, are inspiring scores to adopt the same.Debt-ridden farmer attempts suicideBaripada: A 48-year-old farmer, Maheswar Nayak, attempted to commit suicide by consuming pesticide on Sunday after being unable to clear his debts. He was admitted in Kaptipada hospital and later shifted to Udala Primary Health Centre (CHC) after his condition deteriorated. The incident took place in Pingusahi village under Kaptipada police limits. The farmer had apparently borrowed at least `80,000 from a bank for kharif cultivation over six acres. Sources said the farmers crop grown over five acres was damaged due to pest attack. Blaming the State government for the incident, villagers demanded financial assistance for the debt-ridden farmer. Meanwhile, doctors said the victim is being provided with all the medical facilities."

With onions selling at `40 per kg, the consumers are now feeling the pinch after prices of different vegetables soared between `40 and `100 per kg.In such a scenario, officials of the Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare (FS&CW) department have once again linked the price rise to the problem of limited supply at the source point in Nashik in Maharashtra. There are no reports of hoarding of onions by local wholesalers. We are monitoring the situation. If needed, onions will be sold through Government fair price shops, Sundargarh Civil Supplies Officer (CSO) A Barik said. In July, when onion prices had jumped to `28 per kg, the department had opened 37 fair price shops across the city.If onions were not enough to bring tears to the eyes of locals, vegetables added to their woes. While green peas were sold at `100 per kg, capsicum and carrot were priced at `80 per kg at the markets across Rourkela on Sunday, sources said. Pointed gourd, cauliflower, bean and seam were priced at `60 per kg each. Tomatoes and spinach were priced at `50 per kg, while brinjal, plantain, ladys finger, ridge-gourd and bitter-gourd sold at `40 per kg. Ginger and garlic were selling at `100 and 60 per kg, respectively, sources said, adding that the price of green chilli came as a surprise at `80 to `100 per kg.Amid the soaring prices, sweet potatoes, cow-pea, pumpkin, radish, papaya, cucumber and some local varieties of greens were available for `20 to `30 per kg. Potatoes came as a major relief, selling at `10 per kg, sources added. Usually, by this time of the year, vegetable prices should have decreased. The crisis can be attributed to the lack of locally-grown vegetables in the markets. I hope the arrival of new vegetables to Rourkela city from Nuagaon, Bisra block, Kuarnmunda and Lathikata blocks of the district besides from adjacent pockets of neighbouring Jharkhand will bring down prices, a local vendor, Subal Barik, said."

The price of almost all vegetables has crossed the Rs 70/kg mark, with the majority now in three figures, in the retail market. Prices of vegetables have increased considerably over the last fortnight , even at wholesale markets.Tomatoes cost Rs 130 per kg in retail and were selling for Rs 85 in the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) complex in Jamalpur. Prices may rise further if demand increases.Several vegetables are have touched the Rs 100 mark or are nearing it. Brinjals are now retailing for Rs 60 a kg. Ladies' fingers, cluster beans and green beans are retailing at around the Rs 100 mark.Deepak Patel, APMC secretary, says, ""The prices of vegetables are skyrocketing because of the heavy rains in the city. Whenever there is a long spell of rains in the state, vegetable prices increase.Once water levels recede in the fields, the prices will stabilize again.""Patel further said that the state at present is banking on tomatoes from Maharashtra and south India. About 25% of the crop has been washed away, and hence there is a shortage in the market. Demand is also increasing, and consequently, so are the prices, said Patel.Against a demand for about 500 10-tonne vehicles, the city is getting only 150 vehicles a day. This is not even one-third of the normal supply, and hence prices are increasing even at the APMC complex. Farmers in the state did not get good prices for their produce earlier this year, and as a result they were forced to throw their crops on the roads. Ghanshyam Devgadia a trader in Memnagar says that prices are likely to further increase in August and September."

The reason they cite is illegal occupation of some sheds in the wholesale market because of which several tomato traders have been sitting on a dharna.""We have been protesting for the past six days and met labour minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday, asking that the illegal occupation of our sheds be stopped. However, we have been given no assurances and on Friday, we will go on strike,"" said Anil Malhotra, general secretary of the vegetable traders' association.On Tuesday, about 2,000-2,500 tonnes of tomatoes arrived at the mandi against a normal arrival of about 12,000-16,000 tonnes. Sources said there was a country-wide shortage of tomatoes due to heavy rain in several states and only produce from Himachal Pradesh was reaching Delhi. ""Tomatoes sold for Rs 70-80 per kg in the mandi on Tuesday, which means that in the retail market, one can expect prices to rise to Rs 110 or even Rs 120 in the coming two-three days,"" warn a trader.While the shortfall was expected, the agitation by tomato traders has resulted in an even lesser arrival of tomatoes, said Metha Ram Kriplani, another trader. ""On July 20, APMC issued notices to companies that have illegally occupied seven tomato sheds and two sheds of mausambi. That is a clear acknowledgement that their occupation of the said sheds is illegal. Despite that, no action has been taken against them till now,"" said Kriplani. ""We want our sheds back and want action against officials who have colluded with the encroachers. Unless the encroachment is removed, we will continue with our strike on Friday.""Minister Rai said that he met representatives of both camps on Tuesday and the best solution that he had for this problem was to reallocate the sheds. ""If one camp is claiming that the other has occupied sheds illegally, then this is how sheds have been occupied in the mandi for years. I have spoken to officials as well and now the allotment will be on the basis on payment of market fees. Space will be allocated in proportion to market fees paid.

""The Biju Mahila Janata Dal (BJD's women's wing) will stage protest in all district headquarters against the anti-woman move,"" he said. Pramila Mullick, the BJD women's wing president, said the government undertook publicity campaigns to ensure that maximum women use LPG leaving behind firewood.

""There can't be a worse form of deceit by the government,"" she said. ""We will announce dates of our agitation on Wednesday,"" she said.The BJD members on Tuesday joined the opposition in the protest against the LPG price hike move in Rajya Sabha.

""Only the rich people who are getting undue benefits of subsidy, like the MLAs, MPs and bureaucrats will have to pay the actual price.""Political insiders feel the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), the subsidized cooking gas scheme for economically weaker sections, is a major reason why the saffron party has been able to made inroads into newer territories at the grassroots.

The price of tomatoes in the last week of July was Rs. 50 per kilo. Similarly, baby potato was priced at Rs. 45 per kilo whereas it was Rs. 30 per kilo for the regular variety.Vegetables including ladies fingers and beans were very costly on Monday, with the former priced at Rs. 69 per kilo and the latter Rs. 112 per kg.

5a0dbaa99855b76bf13d115c,Demonetisation and visible hand of market,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/621860/demonetisation-visible-hand-market.html,2017-07-09,,Deccan Herald,"Demonetisation and visible hand of marketKaushik Basu, International New York Times, Jul 9 2017, 23:59 ISTlong term side-effects: Demonetisation failed to do what it was supposed to do, and although the immediate disruption it caused was less severe than feared at first, the policy's impact is turning out to be more protracted than initially expected. nytIn 1776, Adam Smith described the power of the markets invisible hand. Although some economists have since overstated this power, dismissing the role of government regulation, its true that the market, when left to itself, often manages to meet a societys economic needs in ways that no one fully understands. Its a mistake for the state to disrupt it wantonly and for bureaucrats to try to do its job. And thats just the mistake India made last fall.On November 8, 2016, the NDA government suddenly declared that as of midnight that night all bills in denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 would cease to be legal tender. Demonetisation, as the policy is called, applied to 86% of the value of all currency in circulation. It was a state intervention of historic proportion.The goal, the government said, was to eliminate fake Indian currency notes, force people to bring out wealth they had hidden to avoid paying taxes on it  so-called black money  and help India switch from cash to digital money. To counter the criticism that erupted, the government later pointed to other countries that had adopted similar measures in recent times, including Iraq, North Korea and Venezuela.Nearly eight months later, a lot of data is now available to help us assess what demonetisation has actually wrought. Here it is, in a word: demonetisation failed to do what it was supposed to do, and although the immediate disruption it caused was less severe than feared at first, the policys impact is turning out to be more protracted than initially expected.Very little black money has been caught. The truly corrupt hold their black money not as money at all, but as real estate and bank balances abroad. The government had authorised people to trade in up to Rs 4,000 in the cancelled notes, so some parcelled their Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 bills into small bundles and got multiple agents (money mules) to change them, no questions asked. The governments freshly minted Rs 2,000 notes promptly became the new stash currency of choice.In the first weeks, even months, following demonetisation, there was visible chaos. Soviet-era-style queues snaked in front of banks and ATMs. The informal sector  mostly small traders, farmers and small unregistered businesses, which often dont have bank accounts  reeled from cash shortages.But the immediate damage caused, though large, was not as large as some of us had feared. GDP growth in the last quarter of 2016 was 7% and manufacturing activity continued to grow. On the other hand, there may be greater long-term side effects than expected.The problems appeared unexpectedly, when agricultural products arrived on the market. In January, with cash shortages in full swing, demand plunged and food prices collapsed. By February, potato prices in Uttar Pradesh were just over half of what they had been during most of 2016 (at around Rs 350 per quintal, instead of over Rs 600 per quintal).Tomato prices were less than one-third. Onion prices in May were half of what they had been a year before. The cost of onions in India is notoriously volatile  and often influenced by politics and elections  but the likeliest culprit for this years drop was demonetisation.The outcome was curious: Widespread suffering in the midst of plenty. Incomes crashed and distress mounted among farmers, a group in India already affected by high suicide rates because of mass indebtedness. And the downturn has hit more than the farming sector.The Indian economy was on a good trajectory until last year, and the government deserves credit for that. It had taken major steps to cut the costs of doing business and unify taxes on goods and services. With, in addition, the drop in world oil prices (which meant huge savings for India, an oil importer) and the rise of labour costs in China (which made Indian manufacturing and exports more competitive), there was every reason to believe that the Indian economy would soon get back to where it was before the 2008 world financial crisis: growing at over 9% per year. Instead, Indias growth in the first quarter of 2017 was 6.1%, down from 7.9% in the fiscal year 2015-16.Telltale signsAn economy is a complex machine, and there is no way to be absolutely certain that the cause of all this is demonetisation. But there is a telltale sign: Much of the slowdown originated in the financial sector. Rural loans increased by only 2.5% between October 2016 and April 2017, compared with 12.9% a year before. The rate of growth in overall bank credit declined.The growth in industrial output in April was a paltry 3.1%, down from 6.5% the previous April. In the first quarter of 2017, the construction sector actually shrank, by 3.7%, over the previous quarter.All this augurs poorly for the months to come: as the agriculture sector slows down in response to low crop prices and the credit shortage begins to bite, overall growth will likely fall further. The state-engineered shock of demonetisation will continue to course through the economy.Demonetisation did boost the use of digital money, which is more efficient than paper money. But the government didnt need to put 86% of the currency out of circulation to achieve that. Demonetisation was too coarse an approach, and it accomplished too little while causing too much collateral damage.Indias economy has enormous strengths  such as high rates of savings and investment  and this crisis will pass. But just as sailors heading to sea disregard the winds and waves at their peril, economic policy makers cannot ignore the laws of economics, and intervene in the market with a blunt and heavy hand, without risking shipwreck.(The writer, the C Marks Professor of International Studies and professor of economics at Cornell University, was chief economic adviser to the government in 2009-12 and chief economist of the World Bank in 2012-16.)"

At Krishnagiri, the hub of tomato cultivation, bright red ones that filled expansive fields during the abundant harvest shrivelled and died in front of farmers eyes. They had no choice as the market offered just Rs 80 for a 25kg crate (Rs 3.2 per kg).Last Sunday, at the same wholesale market in Krishnagiri, the price had shot up. A 25kg crate was sold for Rs 1,600 and as it made its way through large distributors to wholesalers and finally retail traders, the price hovered around Rs100 per kg for consumers in distant cities.It is the cascading effect of the crisis that had hit farmers at the start of the year that is being felt in kitchens across the State seven months later. It was brought about by a variety of events including glut in the previous season, which was worsened by demonetisation, which led to a severe cash crunch in the market in those months. There was not enough currency available to make any purchase other than essentials.After the drastic setback in winter, many farmers simply refused to cultivate during the next cycle. Few like L Vijay from Rayakottai in Krishnagiri, who went ahead on a half-acre piece of land were hit by the water crisis. He had dug two borewells that went as deep as 1,200ft but found no water. I was forced to buy water at Rs 700 per 6,000 litres, which was used on alternate days to protect my crop.Vijay managed to get a considerable yield but that is a rare success story. Because, as he said, many farmers left without sowing seeds.The effect of this reduction in cultivation was felt in the markets across the western region immediately. At Krishnagiri market, the arrival has dipped to 10,000 crates per day against 40,000-50,000.The sharp fluctuations in price are clearly affecting farmers, markets and consumers, with none having any certainty on how the price would behave at the end of a crop cycle, even if it is only 60-70 days long.There are tomato processing units in Krishnagiri, Kinathukadavu and Tiruchy that the State government is running in association with the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU), said vice chancellor K Ramasamy.According to him, farmers did not follow the announcements that the university made, and sowed without considering the climatic condition and water availability. Such individual cultivation would not help to ensure profitable farming, he said.From this year, following a recommendation by the TNAU, the State government has decided to shift the cultivation method to seedling plantation from sowing seeds. So we hope the cultivation can be streamlined into a systematic manner under the guidance of the State horticulture department.The government is also considering another suggestion by the university on creating 10 marketing societies across the State and introducing mobile processing units to collect the excess produce from the farm itself, he added."

While such an event may not need any medication, it tends to make us spin our gears trying to pinpoint what made us so miserably sick. Reading the clues might reduce risk in the future. NYTIt happens like a bolt out of the blue. One minute youre fine, and the next you begin to sweat as crippling cramps move wavelike through your belly. You vomit or have diarrhoea, or both, fearing you wont live to see another day. And then it goes away. Youre back to your old self, maybe after a day or two of binge-watching Netflix, chasing dry crackers with ginger ale.The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention estimates this scenario, known as an acute gastrointestinal event, happens to all of us at least once a year. The bouts, while extremely unpleasant, usually dont occasion a trip to the doctor or require any medication.But such events tend to make us spin our gears trying to pinpoint what made us so miserably sick. While its hard to know for sure, there are clues that might help you determine the source and reduce your risk in the future. People tend to blame the last thing they ate, but its probably the thing before the last thing they ate, said Dr Deborah Fisher, a gastroenterologist and associate professor at Duke University School of Medicine.It takes the stomach around four to six hours to empty a full meal, and then the small intestine takes about six to eight hours to squeeze out all the nutrients and empty into the colon. The remains linger there for another one to three days, fermenting and being formed into what ultimately is flushed down the toilet. The so-called bowel transit time varies significantly from person to person, but gastroenterologists said you can easily find out whats normal for you by eating corn and watching for when the indigestible kernels appear in your stool.Gross, perhaps, but with that baseline, the next time you get sick, youll be better able to estimate when you might have eaten the offending meal. For example, if you throw up something and dont have diarrhoea or roiling further down, it could be that what made you ill was something you ate within the last four to six hours. If you wake up in the middle of the night with cramps and diarrhoea, its more likely something you consumed a good 18 to 48 hours earlier, depending on the results of your corn test.Most food-borne illnesses are caused by viruses or bacteria, such as norovirus, Staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter, salmonella, E coli and Bacillus cereus. So in addition to figuring out the correct time-frame of consumption, also consider what foods are more likely to be contaminated. Items cited frequently on the Food and Drug Administrations food recall list include leafy greens, culinary herbs, melons with textured surfaces like cantaloupe, fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, jalapeo peppers, nut butters, shellfish, frozen peas, cheese and ice cream.Also suspicious are any foods left out for several hours, like the classic potato salad at the family picnic or fried rice at a Chinese buffet.Restaurant food tends to be riskier in general not only because more hands are involved in the preparation but also because the ingredients are ordered in bulk. A fast-food hamburger could have meat from a hundred different cows, Fisher said, and it takes only one with a pathogen to make you sick. The eggs in your two-egg omelette were poured out of a carton so it could have come from 50 different chickens, she said.Similarly suspect are freshly made juices and smoothies which are extracted from pounds and pounds of produce. Just one speck of contaminated dirt in your detox drink could upend your gut. And think of all the hands that necessarily touched the produce from the time it was picked in the field to when it was chopped and crammed into the Vitamix.Lets not forget about germs on your own hands if youre not diligent about washing them with soap and water. Did you eat or otherwise put your fingers in your mouth after gripping the pole on the subway or after throwing a slobbery ball for your dog? Did you put your mobile phone down on the table at a coffee shop  or on top of the toilet-paper dispenser in a public restroom  and then put it up to your mouth to take a call? Germs that make it into your digestive tract dont always come from food.And sometimes your gut distress isnt caused by a germ at all. It could be an overdose of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, known in public health circles as Fodmaps. These are essentially carbohydrates that, eaten in excess, are not well absorbed in the small intestine and then make their way into your colon to cause all kinds of trouble. They include myriad things were encouraged to eat including broccoli, brussels sprouts, radicchio, asparagus, avocados, mushrooms, peaches, whole grains and legumes.People are trying to eat so healthy these days, but a lot of those things are high in Fodmaps, said Dr Scott Gabbard, a gastroenterologist at the Cleveland Clinic. You could always eat a lot of salad, but on that certain day, that certain combination of fruits and vegetables in your salad was just high enough in Fodmaps that it overrode your systems capability to absorb those carbohydrates and you ended up with something almost like a purging.Gastrointestinal eventsDrugs are also a common source of acute gastrointestinal events. Fisher mentioned the story of an otherwise healthy and active patient who had bouts of GI distress every few months or so. After many tests came back negative, she finally determined it was the ACE inhibitor he was taking to control his blood pressure.A side effect of the drug is that it causes swelling in the intestines so he would get these temporary, partial obstructions, Fisher said. He would vomit and skip a meal and then the swelling would go down. It went on and on until we took him off that drug and now hes fine.Medications used to treat depression, allergies and gastrointestinal reflux can also make you more vulnerable to intense, short duration attacks of vomiting or diarrhoea, or both. Recreational drugs could also be the culprit. Were starting to see more cyclic vomiting syndrome called cannabis hyperemesis because THC content of marijuana now is so high, Gabbard said, referring to psychoactive component of marijuana.Finally, theres stress. Whats going on in your head has an enormous impact on your gut and vice versa. The human brain and nervous system is very intimately mixed with another nervous system that is present in the walls of the intestine, said D Santhi Swaroop Vege, a gastroenterologist at the Mayo Clinic.So instead of something that you ate, it could be youve swallowed your fear, anxiety, anger or sadness and its wreaking havoc on the nerves, chemical secretions and microbiota that keep your bowels operating smoothly. Gastroenterologists as well as psychiatrists said its not uncommon for acute gastrointestinal events to cease or become less frequent after a patient quits a bad job or leaves a bad relationship. Thats why, when making a difficult decision, you might just want to trust your gut."

The current price spiral is remarkable for its suddenness.First, it was tomatoes and now it is onions, whose prices are soaring, much to the discomfort of consumers and policymakers. The current price spiral is remarkable for its suddenness. Only two months ago  that too, during peak summer  tomatoes were retailing at an all-India average of Rs 15 per kg. That rate has quadrupled since, even scaling Rs 100 briefly in some places. Even more striking is that onion, till as late as July 21, was selling below Rs 7 per kg at Lasalgaon in Maharashtra. But today it is quoting at over twice that level in the countrys biggest market for the bulb. The second point to note about the price flare-up now is that it follows a protracted period of low rates for producers. Leaving out the last 10 days or so, onions have been trading in Lasalgaon at below Rs 10/kg since February 2016. Tomato growers were similarly battling Rs 5-6/kg prices from November right through mid-June; they have hardly benefitted from present wholesale prices of Rs 40-plus.There are two reasons for prices going up. The first is the monsoon. Rainfall this time, although normal on the whole, hasnt been as good and well-distributed as in 2016. While Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and even the Marathwada and Vidarbha regions of Maharashtra are facing drought-like conditions, Gujarat and Rajasthan have borne the fury of floods. This has led to delayed plantings or even necessitated re-sowing of the kharif crop in many areas. The immediate impact is being felt in onions and tomatoes, but the effects on other crops  maize, jowar, groundnut, soyabean, cotton  cannot be ruled out. The second explanation may have to do with un-remunerative realisations, post-demonetisation, in most crops until recently. There is evidence, at least in tomatoes, of farmers cutting back on production as a result. The price of that is now being paid by consumers.Going by past record, the Centres most likely response to rising prices would be to impose restrictions on exports (not allowing shipments below a minimum price) and holding of stocks by traders/processors, alongside allowing duty-free imports or even contracting these through government agencies. We saw this in 2014, 2015 and even 2016 in respect of onions, potatoes, pulses and sugar. While being sensitive to the interests of consumers may be a good thing  and also in consonance with the Reserve Bank of Indias inflation-targeting goals  this clearly cannot be at the expense of producers. Like its predecessors, the Narendra Modi government has shown little commitment to the principles of free trade and liberalisation when it comes to agriculture. Hopefully, the promise of doubling farmers incomes by 2022 will lead it to respond differently this time round.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Archive) Summer tomato, harvested between May and July, sees bigger investments by farmers who expect better price realisations. (Express Archive)Speaking of tomatoes, excuse me, why arent we speaking of tomatoes? Theyve reached Rs 100 per kg. Or why arent we crying over the price of onions which has, apparently, spiraled 119 per cent in 10 days (ABP News)? These are seasonal (vegetable) problems, were told. Perhaps. But theyre of far more immediate concern to the public/viewer than politicians who are men and women for all seasons. And dont you remember that Delhis BJP government was brought to tears at the hustings in 1998 by onions?Why not also discuss, debate, expose the abysmal condition of public hygiene and sanitation? When was the last time you didnt see a male or female perform (ablutions) in public  and when, if ever, have you heard a discussion about toilets or garbage disposal or the menace of plastic? The PM cries foul but why doesnt his Mann Ki Baat or the Swachch Bharat advertisements on TV and radio on such fundamental issues make breaking news, headlines or (super) prime time debates? If the price was right, wed throw a few tomatoes at them.Lets not throw any at ABP. On Monday, at prime time, it went on the onion trail from Alwar to Nasik and onto Madhya Pradesh where it found them rotting. They bit into tomatoes too and tried to explain the price rise in both. It was a detailed, in- depth report. Odd that they should be recognised for doing what ought to be routine. More, please.Someone who was pretty red-faced under his skin but did a good job of hiding it is Nitish Kumar. The newly sworn-in chief minister of Bihar for the nth time, was at a televised press conference on Monday, bleeding, sorry, pleading, almost for understanding of the impossible position Lalu & Sons had placed him in. By the time he proclaimed Modi as the winner of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, he looked somewhat crumpled, as if someone had sat upon him.Flashback to October 2015 and recall his stirring campaign speeches we watched during the Bihar assembly campaign when he challenged the PM to beat him in the state. On Walk the Talk (April, 2016, NDTV 247), soon after calling for a Sangh mukt India, he spoke of the BJPs ideology that was potentially poisonous as it divides society; of the need to set aside differences to fight the BJP, etc. What a difference two years makes in politics.If all this worldliness in politics is distasteful and soul destroying, never fear, help is near. Double digit spiritual/religious TV channels are available to salve your disillusioned heart. There are some 20-odd such channels on Tata Sky, including its own devotion channels. More than a dozen of these are related to Hindu spiritual discourse, with Lord Buddha TV, Shalom TV, God TV, Goodness TV for religious diversity. Didnt see one devoted to Islam, which only means that they are not on the popular bandwidths because they do exist.And what on earth is YO TV? No clue, after watching it. Speaking of Tata Sky, it has a bouquet of its own channels which offer education with entertainment and exercise: Tata Sky Fitness, Tata Sky Dance keeps you on your toes, Tata Sky Comedy plays old sitcoms for a laugh, Amitabh Bachchan promises you can learn to act (like him?) on Tata Sky Acting, theres Classic Cinema for those who want to remember when Sunil met Nargis, Tata with Javed Akhtar for the poet in you, Tata Sky Gurus to teach you a few lessons, etcetra, etcetra. Some of it is far superior to what entertainment channels offer.What one of them is offering just now is Pehredaar Piya Ki (Sony TV) in which nine-year-old Prince Ratan marries a woman twice his age, Diya. The age difference would be an emancipating thing for TV soaps but for Ratan being a child groom. They marry in order for her to protect him  again a liberating idea  but decidedly odd and disturbing since surely there are other ways to protect a child? Especially, when Ratan is besotted by her. Its all very absurd, trying to attract viewers by its bizarre premise.On news TV they scream, insult, and say even fake things, to get us to watch them; on entertainment channels they now exploit twisted fantasies.

Rangarajan who once said: Central banking is an art. It was the former RBI governor C. Rangarajan who once said: Central banking is an art.The decision by the RBIs Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to cut the policy repo rate by 25 basis points, from 6.25 per cent to 6 per cent, marks the first such reduction in eight months. The policy action has received subdued enthusiasm from the market based on expectations that the cut could have been 50 basis points.This has been the way the game is played out in recent times. As a policy date nears, demands are raised and a market expectation is built in favour of a cut that, it is expected, would eventually help lower the lending rate, boost investment and revive growth. However, what is often missed out is that the key link in this chain is the transmission of the policy repo cut to the bank lending rate, a link that by the RBIs own admission stands broken. This is what the RBI has flagged in its statement issued alongside the MPC resolution of August 2. The statement announced the setting up of an internal study group for improving the monetary transmission and exploring linking of the bank lending rates directly to market determined benchmarks.If this is the picture today, the question needs to be asked: Where does the rate cut of 25 basis points lead us? The question is important particularly in light of sustaining the growth rate of 7.3 per cent projected by MPC for 2017-18 (against 7.1 per cent in 2016-17) and keeping headline inflation close to 4 per cent on a durable basis. The growth data for 2016-17 show that Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) recorded a growth rate of 8.7 per cent while the Government Final Consumption Expenditure (GFCE) increased by 20.8 per cent. This tells us that the growth is essentially led by government consumption.The higher consumption expenditure of the government is also seen in the first quarter of 2017-18 in data released by the Controller General of Accounts. For example, revenue expenditure accounted for 31.7 per cent of total budgeted revenue expenditure against 26.7 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year. This resulted in a marked increase in the share of revenue deficit (119 per cent) and fiscal deficit (81 per cent).On the other hand, the private sector is suffering from weak investment demand. This is reflected in a broad based loss of speed in manufacturing, excess inventories of coal and near-stagnant output of crude oil. The problem worsens with lack of traction in the implementation of stalled projects coupled with deceleration in the output of infrastructure goods.Thus, the picture is of continued weak private investment not because loanable funds are not available but because corporate balance sheets are not in a position to fire new capex plans. Banks are themselves straddled with NPAs and have no appetite for corporate lending, particularly at a time when the road ahead with a new insolvency law and the proposed fast-track resolution of NPAs remains unclear. Retail inflation fell to a historical low of 1.54 per cent for June 2017 as a result of two factors: Vegetables (which showed a decline of 16.53 per cent) and pulses (down by 21.92 per cent). One has to only head to the market today to know that these are transitory factors, and vegetable prices are already headed high, led by tomatoes at Rs100 per kg.In sum, the perception that inflation is low, growth is on track and the time is right for a rate cut, is flawed. The letter of the MPC resolution recognises this but the spirit has been one of sailing with the wind of market sentiment and some government pressure. This is seen in the change in stance by the MPC members who voted against the cut in June 2017 but switched this time to a 25 basis points cut. The switch reflects an approach that is inconsistent.It was the former RBI governor C. Rangarajan who once said: Central banking is an art. And it is not surprising that the only career central banker on the MPC is the one who voted not to cut the repo rate this time.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Complaining of corruption in the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC, Azadpur) and encroachment of some sheds by new traders, a group of old-timers sat in protest under a tent. Tomato trader Puran Chand, 59, said, Ive been in this business for 30 years. On June 20, my area was illegally occupied by another firm Im suffering major losses. Another tomato trader, 50-year-old Tilak Raj, recounted a similar tale: I have barely bought two boxes of tomatoes since June 20 Ive told the labourers to find a job elsewhere because I have no work to give.While some of the traders organised a dharna on July 19  with a few sitting on a two-day hunger strike  many closed their sheds on Monday in protest. Stating that closing the mandi meant incurring a loss of Rs 30-40 crore daily, Anil Malhotra, general secretary of Azadpur Vegetable Traders Body, said, We demand that the sheds be given back to those who won the bid We also demand insurance for wage labourers and a proper security system, as well maintaining cleanliness in the area.He added, Initially, they (the committee) would accept cheques for market fee payments. Now we can only pay online Every trader is not well-versed with this; how can they force us? Sources in the Delhi government, meanwhile, maintained that the vegetable mandi was in fact open, while the fruit mandi was partially shut. A source said, This was a politically motivated non-strike the Delhi government will not bow down to blackmail.Reacting to accusations by the traders, Satnam Singh, secretary, APMC (Azadpur), said, The issue is of allotment This faction did not let the new allotment of sheds happen in 2016. They dont want reform, which is why theyre also against online payment of market fee. The country is moving towards digitisation but they dont want to. He added, As far as cleanliness is concerned, this is a 24X7 mandi and we do our best. The corruption charges are also baseless.While the traders have called off the strike as a meeting is scheduled with the APMC on Tuesday, they added, If our demands arent met, well shut down all four mandis of Delhi, go on a hunger strike and block Adarsh Nagar Metro station.For all the latest Delhi News, download Indian Express App"

With the aim of teaching gardening skills and waste management, this group has conducted more than 1,500 workshops. We help people start gardens on their terraces, and also train them in how to maintain these gardens through visits and consultations, says 25-year-old Mani, a software engineer.When asked what made him take up gardening, Mani says, It was back in 2012, we were witnessing a new era in gardening. Everything was polluted and contaminated, from the food we consume, the air we inhale, the water we drink and the soil as well. My passion started with several unanswered questions, such as, how to grow an organic garden? Which season is best for more yield? Can I grow vegetables by myself?He adds that they make a difference in the way urban citizens think about gardening, only when there is passion, is when we start questioning and start learning. We started My Dream Garden, as part of Imagine Enterprises and Marketing Solutions, with a passionate team to make people aware and encourage them to grow organic plants, he says.Mani says he mainly grows vegetables, herbs, fruits and a few flowering plants. He says that his favourite plant to grow are tomatoes, as they are beautiful and because its life cycle resembleshuman life.He says that he doesnt like to grow plants that arent suited to Indias climatic conditions, but that he likes to experiment anyway. One vegetable that he has been wanting to grow is lettuce, as it makes the garden beautiful and is healthy for meals as well.He adds that no one has inspired him as such, and that nature itself has been a source of motivation. Nature itself has inspired me the most. My childhood was spent with plants in my native place in Mulbagal, Kolar, he says.Sharing some useful tips on how to maintain a good terrace or kitchen garden, Mani says, Make sure plants get enough sunlight, that the containers are appropriate, that watering is done via sprinkling until germination happens, application of vermicompost or home compost once a week is a must, the use of bio nutrients such as plant meal, bio enzymes, seaweed extraction make for better crops, an organic pest management solution using chili, onion, garlic and ginger paste is ideal, he says.Mani adds that regular pruning and crop rotation is essential."

The country is in the midst of a severe food oversupply, say experts, and farmers are selling their produce for prices less than what they spent growing them.It is also a reflection of demonetisation, when farmers did not have cash to buy seeds for Rabi season. The lack of resources, borrowed money, bumper crop and low demand reflect todays inflation numbers and farmers distress, says economist Arun Kumar.Painting a further grim picture of the economy, factory output for the month of May grew at a meagre 1.7 per cent, compared to 8 per cent last year.The subdued growth in manufacturing is worrying as some major sectors like capital goods, automobile and textiles have shown degrowth. This underlines the need for major reforms to improve the investment climate, said industry body FICCI secretary Didar Singh.It was food prices, that have a weightage of 49 per cent in inflation calculation, which brought the overall numbers down. Vegetable prices are in negative territory for the 10th straight month and pulse prices for the 7th straight month on yearly basis, says Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Adviser, SBI in report.Low inflation is not necessarily a good sign in the long run, says Seema Sharma Economist at IIT Delhi. More so because current numbers fall below the Reserve Bank of Indias tolerable levels that ranges between 2 and 6 per cent.It is a bad sign RBI will not be guided by June numbers, but by what happens in July, because it is the first month of GST and it will try to examine the impact on economy. Its likely that RBI may hold current rates, said Kumar, indicating that the new tax regime might make a repo rate cut unlikely.The government, however, has a different perspective. It feels these are reflections of a consolidation process in the ongoing macroeconomic activity. The number of 1.54 per cent is historically low and reflects the firm and ongoing consolidation of macroeconomic stability, Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian said.Tomatoes, however, defied economics with prices skyrocketing above `90 in Chennai. Traders blamed it on demand in Andhra and Karnataka."

It's ironical that the government has not taken any initiative to open subsidised counters for selling tomatoes or to check its price,"" Tiwari said.The 'tomato bank' has some interesting schemes to offer like providing the commodity on easy loan as also a locker facility, 80 per cent loans on tomatoes and attractive interest rates for depositing tomatoes, especially for the poor.The idea behind the bank is to lodge a protest and to create awareness among the people about the commodity being sold at such high rates.Prices of tomato have shot up about four times since the beginning of June when tomatoes were being sold at about Rs 25 per kg in the Delhi-National Capital Region market.Industry body Assocham had said recently that ""Tomato prices may not immediately ease as flooding in some of the growing states has led to damage to the crop.""Unlike onion and potato, the shelf life of tomato is very short and it needs cold chains and modern warehouses for storage and transportation, it said.Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Odisha are the major tomato growing states.The country produces around 18 million tonnes of tomatoes."

This is the fifth farmer suicide in the state in just over a months time.Sanjay Munda, 25, left no suicide note, but his grieving family members said he took the extreme step after he could not cope with the stress of procuring funds to carry on paddy cultivation after incurring huge losses while growing vegetables.His body was recovered from his house in Betlangi village under Chanho block, 40 km off state capital Ranchi, and was sent for post mortem. Chanho circle officer Pravin Kumar Singh said the death is being investigated by police and that the victims family was handed Rs 3,000 in cash by the BDO as per the norms of a family benefit scheme.He was the sole earning member of our family. He was very worried for the past one month as he did not have money needed to carry on paddy cultivation on our 2.5 acres of land. He was also worried for having no money to pay for the education of his sisters, said Chandu Munda, the victims differently-abled father.Sanjay, the only son of his parents, had been funding the education of his three teenage sisters from his meager income from agriculture and odd jobs. The eldest among the sisters, Ritu, is a first year BA student at a local college. Their mother, Phool Kumari, expired two years ago.He grew tomatoes, cabbage and other vegetables this year, but was distressed as he did not get proper price for the produce. We see no hope for our lives without him around, said Ritu.Opposition Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik) (JVM-P) leader and former CM Babulal Marandi visited the grieving family and urged the Raghubar Das-led government to take steps to prevent more farmer suicides. Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) general secretary Vinod Pandey demanded that the government should ensure free education for the victims three sisters.It is still under investigation whether this death is a suicide or murder, said Deepak Prakash, general secretary of Jharkhands ruling BJP.On June 26, debt-ridden farmer Domna Oraon, of Lohardaga district, committed suicide by consuming pesticide. Baldeo Mahto, a farmer from Pithoria block in Ranchi district, killed himself by jumping into a well on June 15. Kaleshwar Mahto, another debt-ridden farmer from the same block, hanged himself from a tree on June 10. Rajdip Nayak, a farmer from Ormanjhi block, killed himself by consuming pesticides on July 2 allegedly due to harassment by bank officials for repaying loans."

The restaurant has introduced a new menu that includes signature Italian dishes and exotic ingredients. For starters, we were served Fungi misti e Formaggi, Chicken crostini and Calamari, acciughe e fritti di Gamberi.Fungi misti e Formaggi is a platter of mushrooms mixed with fresh greens, walnuts, broccoli and cheese. It has the nutty flavour of walnuts, bitterness of blanched broccoli and the earthy flavour of grilled mushrooms, and comes with an Italian dressing. The Chicken crostini has grilled pesto chicken, olives, onions, bell peppers on a crunchy Tuscan bread served with mixed greens. The olives neutralises the cheese. Smothered in a creamy, basil pesto, it brings out the char-grilled taste of the chicken. It serves as a comfort food.The Calamari in Calamari acciughe e fritti di Gamberi is crunchy and chewy. The crispy soft prawns in the platter goes well with the dip. It is served with french fries and salad. To cleanse our palate, an intermediate course of fruit sorbets topped with mint leaves are served. Next comes the main course. The Risotto aifunghi misti e porri has mushrooms blended with leek risotto prepared with truffle oil. Warm and starchy, it is healthy and makes you feel good. It's a dish that you can have during the rains. The Chicken scaloppini has thinly sliced chicken breast with truffle-flavoured mushroom wine butter sauce, grilled mushroom, tomato and buttered creamy spinach.The platter has garlic mashed potatoes and rosemary grilled veggies that includes broccoli, beans and cauliflower. The mashed potato is a favourite. Even people who do not prefer potatoes, would love it. It has a dominant pungent taste of garlic.The Burro di Dory e aranciapan is a fried polenta crusted John Dory fish with lemon couscous, spaghetti of vegetables, tomato salsa and orange butter sauce. The dish is not bad but it did not meet our expectations.The fish looks crunchy but is not. The vegetables in the noodles adds crunch to the dish. It has grainy Mediterranean khus khus. The desserts are the highlight. The Salted Vanilla Cheese Cake is the best of the lot. It looks so colourful and appealing that you don't want to disturb the presentation. Served with ice cream, the cheesecake platter also has strawberry sauce. Most Americans prefer to have the cheesecake topped with this sauce.But, people here might not take to it and, hence, it is served on the side. The Chocolate, Banana crepe is nice. The thin crepe is smooth. It is caramelised right. The chocolate sauce does not overpower the taste of the banana. It is served with almond Praline and Vanilla ice cream. The Strawberry and Chocolate Ganache Tart has crumbs of red velvet. It is buttery. The outer layer of the tart, made of bisuits, adds a creamy crunch to it. Cost for two: `1,500"

The edible portion of the plant consists of the flower buds before the flowers come into bloom. These are inedible in older, larger flowers.Today, cultivation of the globe artichoke is done only in a few countries and the main European producer is Italy. Apart from its use in food, the globe artichoke is also an attractive plant for its bright floral display, sometimes grown in herbaceous borders for its bold foliage and large purple flower heads.While working for Celler (The Fusion Restaurant) Civil Aviation Club - Dubai, we were trying many ingredients, finding Jerusalem Artichokes was very difficult and hence we landed with Italian Artichokes which turned out to be very relishing and refreshing. We made a salad out of it called as Braised Artichoke Salad, ingredients were artichokes, roasted green tomato, arugula, snow peas, feta cheese, roasted pine nuts, dressed sherry vinegarette.The flavour of the Italian Artichoke is mild, tastes a little nutty and is quite tangy. It is also soft, tender and juicy. The challenge is the ingredients itself, as there is no cultivation in our country but it is available online.

The new menu, which is for only a month at Smoke House Deli, offers six varieties of meats. There is the one Roasted Chicken and Classic Sauce Supreme and Potato Cake, which is served with potato, mushroom, tomato, cream and cheese. Chicken is juicy, abounding in creamy flavours of mushroom while the skin remains delightfully crisp.The potato cake layered with thin slices and sandwiching cheese and egg oozes, when cut, to compliment the fibrous chicken. Boiled tomato gives the meal an acidic twist. Grilled Rib Eye steak, with beef, is served with carrots and asparagus tossed in butter. The ribs are directly grilled without marination so the mild flavour of the meat is retained. Sauce Robert, a brown mustard sauce, is poured over the beef and the brown sauce tastes sharply of onion and butter, the two primary ingredients of Sauce Robert.The meat is hard and chewy, with a sour cream topping the taste balances out. Now onto the Pan Grilled Quail served with Spaghetti Chicken Bolognaise; expect an attractive presentation. The roasted quail nestles on classic spaghetti. The first bite is smoky and bitter and the taste lingers to turn sweeter. Quail tastes like chicken but the flavour is stronger. Minced chicken tossed in spaghetti and harmonised with zesty red wine makes this delectable.Almost similar in style but distinct in flavour is the Pan-seared breast of Duck and Soya Chilli Noodles that bursts with flavours of chilli and garlic. The tangy orange sauce has been tossed with noodles along with chunks of orange. Over this is placed glazed and juicy duck meat. The salad served to the side has lettuce, barley and duck feet, a refreshingly new combination.Besides the bird variety, Crumbed Lamb Cutlets and Mint Pesto is another surprise because this is the only meat in the menu that is fried in butter and not grilled. Caramalised, juicy and crisp, the lamb is cooked to perfection. Grilled Fresh Pork Chops with Home-made Hash Brown is shallow-grilled pork ribs and is medium-rare. The chewy and salty flavour of the pork meshed well with smokey cake-like Hash Brown. Cost for two: `2,000"

Kolkata is known for its trademark roll, a sumptuous snack where chicken or mutton pieces sauted with onions and masala are rolled inside a layered and flaky paratha, and served wrapped in thin paper. The snack was conceived by a small restaurant named Nizams near Hogg Market, Kolkata about eighty years ago, arguably as food to be consumed on the go.Initially it was known as kathi roll, because kebabs inside the rolls were charcoal grilled on wooden sticks or kathi. However, over the decades, as the snack became increasingly popular and roll centres mushroomed all over the city, partially cooked meat finished on a tawa started mostly being used instead of kebabs. A large variety of rolls have evolved in the last couple of decades with eggs added to the paratha, and a vegetarian version using potato or paneer as stuffing. The trend of using tomato or chilli sauces in the filling have also become common, much to the dismay of a puritan like me. One of the reasons of popularity of this street food is that it can serve as a utility lunch, evening snack or dinner. You can customise your roll by adding more layers to it, starting from a simple chicken roll and scaling up to the double egg double chicken version.It is fascinating to see a Kolkata style roll being prepared right in front of you. Freshly rolled out layered and flaky paratha is fried in oil on a tawa. For an egg roll, egg is added on the paratha while frying. The filling is prepared separately with meat, onion, optionally veggies like capsicum or cucumber, and a masala  for the last one many shops have their own proprietary versions. Then the paratha is deftly rolled with this filling, and sauces, lime, chopped chillies and dry masala added as per customer specification.In Hyderabad, the Kolkata style rolls have been popularised by Roll Call, that started as a kiosk selling rolls in Madhapur from 2002. They now have roll centres all over the city. Jayeeta Majumdar Singhee, one of the partners at Roll Call mentioned that apart from the authentic rolls from Kolkata, they have also introduced spicy versions like Chicken and Paneer 65 rolls for the local Hyderabadi palate. Overall, they have around 30 variants of rolls with versions like cheese rolls, seekh kebab rolls and reshmi kebab rolls and the rolls are also easy on the pockets priced at `50-100 range. Roll Durbar in Gachibowli, Amantran in Domalguda and Kolkata House in Kondapur are some other places to enjoy Kolkata style rolls."

The BKRG comprises of a group of Kochi natives, engaged in different vocations, who intervene in public related issues and aim to make the city a better place. We have decided to spread this campaign to Thiruvananthapuram and other parts of the state as well, said Gopakumar.He said their campaign was inspired from a Japanese movement in which the people boycotted anything that shows an unnatural increase in price.The campaign which started on July 22 is likely to continue till August 15. Till we see a decline in the price of tomatoes to Rs 50 per kg. The campaign waspropagated through Whatsapp. A similar price hike is seen in other food items like green chillies and chicken as well, he added.Gopakumar said Kochiites should either completely stop or minimise consumption of tomatoes just for a few weeks.This will have a demoralising effect on those hoarding the vegetable. It will in turn bring down the price within a week or two. If we stand united, we will be able to ensure the campaign is a huge success, he added.Meanwhile, the price of tomato came down to Rs 85 on Monday from last weeks price of Rs 110 per kg. While many have turned to other alternatives some still buy tomatoes, though in smaller quantities. Tomatoes are an essential ingredient in every dish we make whether its is sambar or rasam. The price hike last month has affected the middle class, said Jisha K, a housewife.Recently, the Union Government had pointed out that the price hike of tomatoes is only a seasonal phenomena. It also warned the state government to conduct regular inspections to prevent artificial storage and supply of stock. The vegetable vendors said the supply from the northern states has dropped sharply due to rain. It is estimated 70 per cent of the tomato crop has been damaged due to excess rain."

Since more than two decades, places like Universal Bakery as well as King and Cardinal in Himayatnagar have had loyal clientele feasting on their indigenous Hyderabadi burgers. A significant twist in the local burgers is that they usually have no patty in between the buns, instead there is minced meat, dollops of mayo, tomatoes and cabbage.However, it is the vegetarian tawa burger from a small outlet in Ranigunj which is recently making waves in the twin cities. Premium Tawa Burger from Shalimar Tiffin and Snacks is so much in demand that people travel from Hi-Tec City all the way to Secunderabad for it. The patty-less cheesy burgers prepared on a tawa use a totally indigenous recipe, and are extremely mouthwatering. And to top it all, it is light on the pocket costing only `90.The burger recipe is a brainchild of Dilip Mor, the proprietor of this pure vegetarian tiffin center, located opposite the well-known City Lights Bakery. While his shop is more than two decades old, he started selling burgers only in 2011. Three years back, he began making the Premium Burger, and ever since then there is no looking back for him. He uses a proprietary recipe with a special mystery chutney prepared by the family. Also once stuffed, the whole burger is finally rolled in a buttery masala giving it a special taste.You can see the burger being prepared on a tawa right in front of you.A lot of vegetables like capsicum, tomatoes, coriander leaves and chillies, as well as abundant paneer and cheese is sauted on the tawa with a specially prepared proprietary red chutney to make the stuffing. Two kinds of cheese are used  processed and cheddar. This filling is then stuffed inside a soft bun, but unlike conventional burgers the process does not end here.A second round of cheese based masala is again prepared on the tawa, with butter, a dry powder having garlic and ginger as well as the special chutney. After this the burger is actually rolled in this greasy masala, for a buttery look. As you dig into the burger, it gives a right balance of spices and flavours, and of course a lot of cheese.Shalimar also has a regular burger priced at `60 with the stuffing of mashed potatoes. They also recently introduced a mini version of the premium burger for those with a small appetite. The burger does not get soggy even after a few hours, and such is the reputation of this place that customers carry it to other Indian cities and even Dubai, and this street food center has a special flight packaging for this.

My chauffeur Tim had a lovely dog Brady, who insisted on taking the ride with me. We raced on the streets, as Bradys fur gently caressed my cheek. We drove past the Castle of Good Hope (built in the 17th century, it is the best-preserved example of a Dutch East India Company fort), Houses of Parliament and the Companys Garden (created in 1650s by the first European settlers, it is a park and heritage site).Then we headed to Sea Point, Cape Towns most affluent and densely populated suburb. At Camps Bay, another affluent suburb, we took a break to enjoy the scenic ocean vistas as Brady ran and played on the beach sand.Then happened Bo-Kaap. It is the prettiest neighbourhood in Cape Town with houses that are swathed in loveliest colours, standing on romantic cobbled streets from the 18th century. It is neither upmarket nor is it a posh quarter of Cape Town filled with mansions.But it seemed to be the most photogenic place where houses were like colourful birds perched in a row. The Bo-Kaap, formerly known as the Malay Quarter is situated on the slopes of Signal Hill above the city centre. It is the traditional home of Cape Towns Muslim population since the second half of the eighteenth century. The houses are a mixture of Cape Dutch and Cape Georgian architectural styles and this, combined with the Islamic faith, culture and eastern origin of the majority of its inhabitants, give the Bo-Kaap a setting that visitors find both captivating and exotic.Descendants of indentured labour brought by the Dutch from various Asian (mostly Malaysia and Indonesia) and African countries, during the 16th and 17th centuries, these slaves were generally called Cape Malays, though not all of them were of Malaysian origin. When the British took over Cape Town from the Dutch in 1795, the slave trade was abolished. When their slavery ended, they acquired religious freedom and the newly emancipated slaves formed a new community at Bo-Kaap. The founders of this community were the first to bring Islam to South Africa.Intermarriages between slaves from East Indies with those from India, Madagascar, and native African groups created a distinctive Cape Malay culture. It is said that many local women converted to Islam and married Muslim men, as they are teetotallers and made trouble free husbands. People in the Cape Malay community speak mostly Afrikaans and English, with Malay words and phrases thrown in. Bo-Kaaps multifaceted heritage is reflected in its music, dance and food too.Adaptations of traditional foods such as tomato bredie, bobotie, sosaties and koeksisters which are the staples in many South African homes originated from Cape Malay cuisine, which in itself is a fusion of many cuisines.Bo-Kaap Kombuis (Kitchen) is a place everyone recommends for an authentic Cape Malay meal. Their starters reminded me of home: samosas (just like our alu samosas), rolls, dalchies (similar to Indian spinach and moong dal pakoras), and patatawaras (like our batata wada back home). The Indian influence in the main courses too is evident due to generations of widespread intermarriage and union between the two communities.Yusuf Larney runs the joint with his wife Nazli who is a third generation Indian from Gujarat while Yusufs great grandfather came from Ireland. His forefathers married people from the Eastern countries and were integrated into Cape Malay culture. Speaking of Bo-Kaap, he said 90% of the population here is Muslim while the other 10% are Christians, Hindus and Indians. We all live with absolutely no conflict, it is the safest area in the whole of S A. We welcome inter marriages. We respect each other: we believe in sitting across the table and talk to each other first to sort out problems than first go and kill each other.I took a stroll down the road, feasting my eyes on every house. As we walked along, JP threw light on the brightly coloured houses on either side of the street, which, he said, is a recent innovation that celebrates the districts Muslim identity. In earlier days, all the houses of Cape Town were painted white. Then the residents of Bo-Kaap began painting their houses in vivid colours in preparation for the celebration of Eid. Neighbours would often agree on what colours to use so as not to have a clash of shades - in fact, the colours complement each other and act as landmarks as well. But sometimes, to outdo others, some clever residents paint their house a different colour overnight and surprise the neighbours!Of course, the last statement seemed a big joke, his own fiction, like most guides of his ilk. His jokes were often followed by his huge guffaws and gurgling laughter, hinting us to take the cue. JP made our Cape Town visit a huge fun, in fact, as huge as his enormous frame!(The author is a documentary filmmaker and travel writer; she blogs at ijayaprataptravelandbeyond.com)"

Contrary to popular belief, Dubai offers a delectable treat to vegetarians as well. Kusdhari, an Egyptian dish made of rice; macaroni and lentils; and charcoal lemonade are just some of the various delicacies that Dubai has to offer.Given the large Indian population in Dubai, it is only fitting that India gets a proportionate representation in Dubais cuisine.

The vegetarian menu at the rich-in ambiance restaurant included Saag Paneer, it is winter spinach and Masala Paneer grilled together. Badam Aur Shatavari Ki Tikki, which is almond and asparagus galette spiced with fennel and ginger. Malai Kofta Curry in Delhi style. A Kerala delicacy Kadambam Varuval was Kerala style vegetable masala with shallots, curry leaves and home ground Kerala spices. As a south Indian, it felt home on taste-buds.The desserts included chocolate delice, pistachio ice cream and poached pears.The Dubai Food Festival saw immense participation from food vendors and foodies alike. Among the most popular stalls was Kaak Al Manara, a Lebanese joint on Jumeirah Road. Its most sought-after dish was Kaak, a bag shaped, dairy free, vegan bread made of wheat flour and sesame. Its founderZiyak Ayaz was the first to introduce Kaak in Dubai two years ago at the Ripe Market and has diversified the simple bread into various flavours of which the authentic pickle and spread salty cheese topped with sumac was our favourite.Other dishes on demand include Polish sauteed mushrooms on a bed of tomato sauce topped with cheese.

Outside food , cigarettes and tobacco packets are being taken inside the jail with impunity.When this reporter visited the district jail premises on Tuesday evening between 4.30pm and 5.30pm, which is a visiting hour, the visitors were seen carrying all sorts of food items. Interestingly, each visitor was carrying food items in huge quantities which can be served to at least four to five people.One person had come with pundi (rice dumpligs), parottas and chicken sukka. Another person had come with mutton dry, parotta, dosa, fish fry and rasam. Three youths carried a bag containing several kilograms of potato, tomato, cabbage, onion, beans, cucumber and huge amount of spices and masalas inside the jail. However, one thing that was common among all the visitors was that each one of them was carrying packets of cigarettes and other tobacco products. The guards present at the gates allowed these items only after a thorough inspection.A guard, who was present at the jail entrance, pointed out that supply of outside food and number of visitors has increased substantially after the Bantwal communal incidents.""No food items can be taken inside the jail premises as per the prison manual, and tobacco, alcohol and cigarettes are a big no no,"" says S P Chengappa, senior advocate and president of Mangaluru Bar Association.He adds that certain foods can be served to a convict or undertrial only if the court permits it on the recommendation of the doctors. He added that officials in the district jail have not learnt a lesson even after several untoward incidents including murders took place. ""The situation inside the jail has gone out of control. Prisoners possess mobile phones and are in constant touch with the outside world,"" he added.A retired jail official, who served in various capacities in Mysuru and Bengaluru jails, pointed out that ganja smuggling was rampant inside the jail and no officer could stop it till date.When TOI contacted Vijay R, in-charge jail superintendent of the district jail and drew his attention towards food and tobacco products being taken into the jail, he remained tight-lipped. ""We are trying to curb tobacco supply inside jail in a phased manner,"" he said.Currently, the district jail houses over 400 persons including a dozen female undertrials as against its capacity of 210.

He grows more than 10 varieties of vegetables and fruits, including beans, tomato, bitter gourd, snake gourd, pomegranate and guava. He runs a retail outlet for organic products (Iyal) and says that the number of stores selling organic products in the city has increased by 25 % in the last three years.For the stores in the city, organic fruits and vegetables also come from places such as the Nilgiris, Kannivadi, Pudukottai, Dharapuram, Hosur, and Erode.Though awareness and consumption are relatively higher in cities such as Chennai and Bengaluru, it has increased here too, he says.According to Shantha Ramasamy of Sreevatsa Organic Farm Products, organic produce normally remain fresh for a longer time. The cost depends on the weather of the location where the produce is grown. Not just fruits and vegetables, even value-added products are going organic. When the demand for organic products increase, the farmers stand to benefit, she says.A.R. Selvaraj, an organic farmer who also runs a store, says that organic fruits and vegetables from this region are sent to cities such as Madurai, Trichy and Chennai too. For the last few months, awareness has improved about organic milk, he says.Awareness among people regarding the health benefits of organic foods has escalated in the past five years, says Rajesh Keerthi, who runs an online organic store. Though the cost is on the higher side, customers go for it considering the health benefits.Availability and affordability are the main drawbacks when it comes to buying organic vegetables and fruits regularly. Small local farmers often use organic methods but sometimes cannot afford to get their farms certified as organic. If the prices reduce, sales and consumption would increase and it would benefit the farmers, says S. Manoj, a regular customer of organic products."

Gomathi of Periyar Nagar in Erode. Dependence on non-vegetarian food has increased in the past one month from weekly once to thrice. We have to work on cost cutting measures for a balanced budget, she says.From tomatoes and small onions to even the fresh greens, prices of most vegetables are up across the region. It is the result of a combination of factors, say farmers, traders, and officials. Failure of monsoon last year and demonetisation had an impact on sowing, they say.Dharmapuri, Salem, Namakkal, Coimbatore and the Nilgiris are among the main horticulture crop growing centres in the State.Over 3,500 hectares are under tomato crop in the blocks of Mecheri, Kaadayampatti, Omalur, Pethanayakkanpalayam, Attur in Salem district. Small onion is raised in more than 4,000 hectares in Namakkal district and about 700 hectares in the Kolathur, Vazhappadi and Gangavalli blocks in Salem district.Repeated failure of monsoon resulted in standing crops withering in many parts, leading to fall in the arrival in the uzhavar santhais and open markets, say officials in Salem and Namakkal.Three kg of tomato was priced at Rs. 10 in May and now it is Rs. 60 - Rs. 64 a kg. During the peak season period, the uzhavar santhais used to receive about seven tonnes of tomatoes every day. Currently, about five tonnes of tomatoes reach the market.Following the commencement of small onion harvesting season in Salem District, there has been reasonable increase in the arrival of onion stock from the villages. The price of small onion which stood at more than Rs. 100 per kg last month, has come down. The price of good quality small onion stood at Rs. 84 and the second quality onion at Rs. 80 at the Salem Uzhavar Santhai on Sunday. The prices of tomatoes and small onions are expected to stabilise in the Salem wholesale markets once arrivals start from the nearby cultivation pockets.The shortage of rainfall and demonetisation seem to have played into the cropping area in Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts. Bathalahalli is the largest wholesale market that attracts traders from across the State and sends vegetables to Kerala too. The general fall in production of vegetables in Thally, Denkanikottai, Hosur and Rayakottai  whose farmers are the largest suppliers of cabbage, tomatoes, beans, carrots, beets, is one of the reasons for the price rise. The supply has fallen, but the demand has increased, say traders.President of Traders Association of Bathalahalli market Raja Reddy says the number of trucks loading vegetables is between 80 to 100 tonne on any day and it has remained almost the same, subject to availability of vegetables. The price of most vegetables range from Rs. 50 to Rs. 60 per kg. Beans has been going at Rs. 50 per kg for the last 6 months, he says. This year, tomato cultivation fell significantly. Its price at the market is Rs. 70 per kg, he adds. Normally, June- August witness a rise in tomato prices largely coinciding with the fall in the vegetables production in other growing regions of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.The 70-day crop was hit right when demonetisation came. Farmers, who were already mid-way into the crop and awaiting harvest, were hit. To cut down on costs, the area of cultivation was also reduced, says a Rayakottai-based farmer.In the Nilgiris, though the prices of vegetables such as potatoes and tomatoes remains extremely high, English vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, beans and beetroot, which are produced in large quantities in the Nilgiris, have not seen a steep hike in prices.According to Raja Mohammed, a wholesale vegetable supplier, the wholesale rate of broccoli currently is Rs. 130 per kg., while carrots are sold for anywhere between Rs. 35-40 per kg. depending on the quality and freshness of the produce. Beetroot is also selling for between Rs. 28 to Rs. 35 per kg., which is the usual price that these vegetables are sold for during this season.The price of English vegetables increase only during the wedding season, when they are purchased in large quantities for feasts, he says. Though the prices of vegetables such as tomatoes and potatoes are still high, there has not been a major demand for cheaper alternatives, said other vegetable sellers in the Ooty Municipal Market.(With inputs from Syed Muthahar Saqaf in Salem, P.V.

Tomato is largely grown in fields having borewells. Many have completed planting recently and harvest is expected only next month or early September. Until then, prices may not fall drastically, but there is a likelihood of little drop in prices till early next month, sources in the APMC market said. Tomato yield is less this year compared to last year. Lack of rain and drop in groundwater table are among the reasons.

Its no wonder then that its most popular wine is a ruby red from Rioja (pronounced ree-oh-hah), usually made with Tempranillo grapes.While in India, we have been familiar with the Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah (Shiraz) varieties for a while thanks to our homegrown wine industry, but Tempranillo is still a fairly new grape to us. Federico Lleonart, global wine ambassador for Pernod Ricard Winemakers was in India recently for the launch of Campo Viejo, one of the premire Rioja brands in the world, which recently dbuted in India. We spoke to him to help demystify the Tempranillo.The regionRioja is by far the most traditional, prestigious, and famous wine region in Spain. It has a DOCA appellation (qualified designation of origin), the highest regulation of quality and geographical origin for Spains products. Its largely a red wine region; but a small amount of white wine is made here too, mostly from the Viura grape, the white counterpart to the Tempranillo. As with many regions in Europe, wine production in Rioja started in the Roman times, so the region has more than 2,000 years of winemaking history, says Lleonart. Rioja rose to fame in the mid-19th century when the French producers arrived to seek an alternate wine-growing region after a severe blight destroyed the Bordeaux vineyards. Located in northern Spain, Rioja is a diverse region with three very different sub-regions. Theres the Rioja Alta, which is at a higher elevation and is known for its old-world style of wine. The Rioja Alavesa in the northwest and the smallest sub-region, which produces full-bodied wines with high acidity. Finally, the Rioja Baja, is influenced by a Mediterranean climate, leading to deeply coloured wines with a high alcohol content.The grapeRiojas signature grape is the Tempranillo. Its a very versatile grape that can produce a young, fruity wine as well as a Grand Reserva wine that has been aged for five years, says Lleonart. The range of flavours that you can get out of Tempranillo is very hard to get from other varieties. Tempranillo grapes smell like red fruits such as cherries, plums, and raspberries. Because of its versatility, it pairs well with different types of foods from meat and poultry to seafood and cheese.The brandCampo Viejo started in 1959 when three winegrowers from the region got together with the idea of producing high-quality Rioja wine. We are not the oldest or the largest winery in the region, but we are certainly the number one Rioja brand in the world. Campo Viejo exports to more than 60 countries, says Lleonart.The current winery was built in 2001 and is located just outside Logroo, the capital of Rioja. Our winery was certified as carbon-neutral five years ago. We use sustainable practices and also teach them to the winegrowers who work with us; sustainability is the only way to move forward, declares Lleonart.The winesWhile Campo Viejo has a large portfolio, it makes its debut in India with two wine variants, one red and one white, and both of them fall in the category of vin joven or young wine that isnt aged much, if at all. Campo Viejo Tempranillo is a red wine made with 100% Tempranillo grapes. Its a very fruit-forward wine, very smooth and easy to drink. Theres a smell of red fruits, a touch of liquorice, and because the wine is aged for four months in American oak barrels, theres also a hint of vanilla and coconut, explains Lleonart.It tastes fruity and fresh with low tannin. The drinkability of this wine is the key to its success in India; its a wine that will appeal to most consumers, elaborates Lleonart. The second wine is Campo Viejo Blanco, a white wine made with a blend of Tempranillo blanco and Viura grapes, that is not aged. This wine is super-new; we launched it only last year in the UK and later in Sweden, and now its in India. It is mainly made with Viura grapes but also has Tempranillo blanco, a white mutation of Tempranillo that appeared back in the 80s, says Lleonart.For a young market, and given the Indian penchant for wines that are sweeter and lighter, debuting with two fresh, fruit-forward wines seems like the right strategy for Campo Viejo. India has a great market potential and Campo Viejo is growing well around the world, so it made sense to expand into India, concludes Lleonart.Campo Viejo wines are priced at Rs. 2,000 in Mumbai."

Also, production has been less this year. In 2016, the prices hovered around Rs. 10 per kg in the wholesale market as tomatoes had been grown on a large scale, said Mr. Das.He, however, expressed hope that prices would crash in the next fortnight, when supply poured in from Bengaluru and Nashik.Vendors, meanwhile, are selling tomatoes at Rs. 80-90 per kg.The skyrocketing prices of the indispensable vegetable have also become the butt of jokes on social media.Pls dont misunderstand.

Prices have increased from Rs. 10 per kg to Rs. 20 per kg in less than 10 says, said Mr. Sharma.He, however, refused to speculate on far the prices might go up in the near future.Common phenomenonThe prices of seasonal vegetables, such as bottle gourd, bitter gourd and okra, have also doubled over the past fortnight.Hemant, a commission agent who deals in vegetables, however, argued that the rise in prices of vegetables was a common phenomenon during this part of the year.Crops are damaged due to heavy rain during monsoon, which in turn affects supply. The prices will continue to remain high for another two months, said Mr. Hemant.However, before the vegetables reach the kitchen, the prices go up by another 30-40%, making them unaffordable for the common man.Ram Pal, a squatter near Shani Mandir in Sector 37, argued that despite selling the vegetables at a rate 30-40% higher than the wholesale price, he ended up making only a marginal profit.I need to make up for the damaged and unsold vegetables and also recover the transportation cost. So, I end up making just Rs. 3-4 per kg after a hard days hard work, said Mr.Pal.Potato prices, however, continue to hover around Rs. 4-5 per kg on account of overproduction this year."

""We had informed the farmers about the strike, so most of them did not come here. A slight shortage may continue on Tuesday but, if we decide to call off the strike, the situation should stabilise by Wednesday,"" said a trader.The reason for the unrest was a decision by the government to reallocate tomato sheds. A section of traders had complained to APMC about some unauthorised people who had occupied their sheds.""APMC later issued showcause notices to these traders but the response was not satisfactory. So, teams have gone there on a couple of occasions to remove them but traders have threatened self-immolation. On Monday a final notice was issued and appropriate action will be taken soon,"" said a senior official.Despite the eviction, government officials said, reallocation of sheds would still be done.

The June number was the lowest since CSO started publishing the new retail inflation data in 2012. Separate data showed the annual rate of inflation, based on the monthly wholesale price index, stood at 1.9% in July compared to 0.9% for the previous month and 0.6% during corresponding month of the previous year.The increase in WPI inflation was largely led by vegetables, minerals and some food items. Vegetable prices rose an annual 22% while mineral prices shot up 25%. Robust monsoon rains are expected to have a sobering impact on prices but floods in some parts may put some temporary strains on supplies.""As expected, CPI inflation rebounded to 2.4% in July 2017 from the series low of 1.5% in June 2017, on account of rising vegetable prices, the revision in HRA (house rent allowance) and, to some extent, higher GST on various services,"" said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ratings agency ICRA.Some economists said the data showed that fears of an increase in prices post introduction of GST and implementation of Housing Allowances on headline inflation are rather limited at this point. According to Soumya Kanti Ghosh , group chief economic adviser at SBI, the July inflation number should ""thus be a transient one purely contributed by tomato prices.""Core CPI inflation recorded a marginal uptick to 4% in July 2017 from 3.9% in the previous month. Nayar said prices of various vegetables have displayed a month-on-month hardening so far in August and in addition, a reversal of the favourable base effect could result in retail food inflation rising further in the ongoing month. She said the staggered impact on the housing index, of CPI of the HRA of central government employees, is likely to push up housing inflation further over the coming year.""As the favourable base effect unwinds, vegetable prices record a seasonal hardening and the impact of HRA pushes up housing inflation further, we expect CPI inflation to ramp up over the next few months, and cross 4% by October 2017. Based on this anticipated trajectory, and the recent commentary by the Monetary Policy Committee , we see a low likelihood of further rate cuts in FY-18,"" Nayar said.In its latest monetary policy review earlier this month the RBI had cut the repo rate to 6% but kept the monetary policy stance at neutral, flagging possible return of inflationary pressures. While the government has been eyeing a sharp cut in interest rates, RBI has maintained its cautious stance."

The price of goat meat ('mutton', in local parlance) has gone down in the past month. And you can thank the friendly neighbourhood chicken seller for providing stiff competition, which has caused the price dip.While goat meat is selling at Rs 520 at Manicktala and Rs 530 at Rahmania in Kidderpore, it is as low as Rs 480 and even Rs 450 at markets in Gariahat and Behala. Till last month, the price was upwards of Rs 550.Meat traders blame chicken, which is selling for prices as low as Rs 120 across markets. Also, during monsoon, goats tend to develop fatal diseases (pneumonia, enterotoxemia and foot-and-mouth disease) and so, most sellers try to get the goats sold as quickly as possible.Food-loving Bengalis are overjoyed at the uncharacteristically 'downwardly mobile' prices.""At a time when all vegetables  from tomatoes to onions  are getting pricey, chicken and mutton prices have suddenly gone down. We are eating mutton at least twice or thrice a week these days. Earlier, mutton was only a Sunday treat,"" said Gariahat resident Arup Chakraborty Meat sellers at Gariahat said the price of goat meat was Rs 530 till end-June. Since then, there was a gradual decrease in the price, and now it's selling for Rs 480. ""The price has gone down since we are getting goats cheaper. Goat sellers are selling off the animals quickly fearing the animals would contract fatal diseases,"" said Md Asif, a seller at Gariahat.At Rahmania in Kidderpore, the price was hovering near the Rs 570 mark, but it has now come down to around Rs 530.However, 'reyaji mutton (goat meat with just the right amount of fat)', a delicacy and a speciality at their shop, is still priced at Rs 550. ""There has been a slight drop in price across the city. Apart from the cattle disease, another reason is stiff competition from chicken,"" said an employee at the shop.To make the most of the occasion, families of would-be brides and grooms in the upcoming wedding season are in a hurry to change their chicken platters with mutton items. ""We have been receiving requests to alter our price or change chicken items with mutton, but we have told our customers that the current price cannot affect our rate chart in any manner, as when we actually buy the meat, the prices are definitely going to rise again. We have a fixed rate chart and are charging our clients accordingly, irrespective of the changing prices,"" said Dwaraka Dutt of Diamond Caterers.Restaurants across the city, too, are following the same norm but some roadside eateries have slashed the prices of mutton rolls and mutton keema by around Rs 2 to Rs 5 to lure more customers. Industry sources said the prices are sure to increase a week before Viswakarma Puja on September 17 and again before the start of the wedding season.During monsoon, goats are prone to acquiring a number of parasite and bacteria-borne diseases that remain dormant during dry season. With arrival of wet weather, the parasites get the upper hand and their populations explode. The common diseases being pneumonia, foot and mouth disease  fatal contagious disease on the hoofs and mouth  and enterotoxemia  a disease that occurs due to toxin produced by bacteria of clostridium species."

Each truck carries about 10 tonnes of onions.Officials said that the prices of onion at the end of July was around Rs6 to Rs7 per kg in the wholesale market, and it has increased to Rs27.50 per kg. Interestingly during the same period last year, the prices of onions ranged between Rs6 to Rs8 per kg.Deepak Patel, secretary of APMC , Ahmedabad, said, ""Last year, many farmers in Maharashtra and even Gujarat did not get adequate prices against their onion crops, and hence they didn't go for onion farming this year. This has led to a shortage of the vegetable.""Patel said it was difficult to make any prediction about the next season, but prices will most likely continue to rise. ""In Shravan, people refrain from using garlic and onion in Gujarat, but once Shravan is over, there will be a spike in demand accompanied by increase in prices,"" Patel said, adding, ""We expect onion prices to stabilize by last week of October or the first week of November, when the new crop arrives.""An office-bearer of APMC, Ahmedabad said that it was not just onion prices, but all vegetable prices have increased. Brinjals, according to quality, cost between Rs40 and Rs100 per kg in wholesale. At this time last year, tomatoes cost about one-fifth of what they cost now. Officials said vegetables in the retail market usually cost double or more than those in the wholesale market.APMC officials said that a good sign was that in the last couple of days prices had stabilized to a certain extent. Tomato, which had crossed the Rs80 mark was now down to Rs50 in the wholesale market, and has plateaued out, hopefully."

If the price hovered around R20-R25 a kg a few days back, it is now hovering around R40 a kg.Onions were being sold for Rs 40 per kg at retail shops for the last two days. We have reduced the usage of onions in our day-to-day cooking. We purchased a little quantity only for specific dishes, says N Ramadevi, a resident of Ramesh Reddy Nagar. Consumers like her are pointing accusing fingers at onion traders, alleging that the latter have been hoarding onions in huge quantities to create artificial scarcity. Normally, the district imports onions from Maharashtra and Kurnool markets as local produce is not sufficient to meet the demand."

Retail inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index was revised downwards to 1.46 per cent for June.It is also a reflection of monthly kitchen costs, which continued to remain soft, with prices showing gradual improvement at (-) 0.29% from (-) 2.12 per cent in June against 8.35 per cent in the same period last year.The fall in food inflation has been brought about by disinflation in the prices of mainly pulses and vegetables, which is assessed to be a stabilising factor.Vegetable prices fell by (-)3.57 per cent in July compared with (-)16.53 per cent in June, prices of pulses fell (-)24.75 per cent, against (-)21.92 per cent in June. Prices of foods and beverages became costly by 0.43 per cent against (-)1.17 per cent growth. While fuel inflation was 4.84 per cent in June, against 5.46 per cent in May and data shows that housing inflation remained nearly flat, growing 4.98 per cent in July from 4.7 per cent in June.Higher food articles and vegetable prices have pushed up wholesale inflation for July by 1.88 per cent, compared to 0.9 per cent in June. Wholesale inflation was low in July last year at 0.63 per cent.Food prices of pulses, potatoes and onions experienced a free fall as a result of a supply glut. Vegetable prices were up 22 per cent in July as a result of a hike in tomato prices.The heavy rains and delay in crop arrival to the mandi/markets made it costly for the consumers as the prices grew by 25.47 per cent in June. However, the broad conditions for agri-prices remain conducive given normal monsoon in most parts of the country and stable global commodity prices. This outlook is also corroborated in the second part of the Economic Survey released last week, said Pankaj Patel, president, FICCI.The wholesale price index data shows the doubling in the rate of inflation in July was mainly on account of a turnaround in prices of food article, especially vegetables."

With the Centre turning back to the statehood demand, the Mamata Banerjee administration has also continued with total isolation of the hills by cutting off Internet.IN PICTURES: Gorkhaland protests in DarjeelingLPG cylinder prices have touched high of Rs1,800 per cylinder and availability of food in markets have touched new low. Food supplies from the plains have been stopped by Bengali organisations of Siliguri, allegedly supported by the police.Though GJM has often distributed eatables to residents of tea gardens where cultivation does not take place, it has never been sufficient.However, one word has kept the indefinite strike going is indigenous knowledge.The indigenous knowledge orally passed down through generations has allowed the consumerism-struck residents of the two hill districts to fall back to their roots.This indigenous knowledge has enabled the residents to scourge the correct locations in the forests for shoots and roots and cultivate indigenous varieties of crop after supplies from the plains stopped. The indefinite strike has also led to increased cooperation between people -- including age-old barter system -- which had faded away as consumerism crept in.""Many of us had started to depend on rice from the plains and stopped cultivating our locally-grown indigenous varieties. Now, many farmers in our village and neighbouring villages are cultivating maize and local varieties of rice and are also fetching bamboo shoots and wild mushrooms from the forests. Many are also preparing fermented soyabean, a must with every meal that was earlier available in the markets, at their homes,"" said Man Bahadur of Yokprintam village, 25 km from Kalimpong town.The soil of this part of the Himalayas also supports cultivation of a variety of vegetables including potatoes, ladies finger, brinjals, tomatoes, beans, bitter gourd among others.With currency notes rendered useless in the wake of the complete shutdown, availability of farm workers has also gone down the abyss, which has also forced people to work together at each other's farmlands.""It seems we have returned to the traditional way of cultivation that our forefathers followed when society was egalitarian. Farm workers are not available due to the strike. So, people nowadays work together in rotation at one person's farm in the village. The next day, they will all work at someone else's land. After work, all the farm workers eat at the residence of the person on whose land they worked. Nobody is small or big in this work. This has brought us closer,"" said Ramesh Rai of Samalbong village in Kalimpong district.Besides this commune-type work, villagers are also sharing their meat. ""Just today, a big chicken was slaughtered at my house. While we kept 1 kilogram, we gave the rest to our neighbours. They would do the same when they slaughter their chickens,"" said Suren Tamang of Seokbhir Khani village of Kalimpong district.However, one crop that has taken a beating due to the strike is ginger. ""While 40 kg of ginger costed Rs 6,000 last year, it has reduced to only Rs 800 per 40 kg due to the strike,"" said Mangal Tamang of Takling village, equidistant from both Darjeeling and Kalimpong towns."

The hike in onion prices is burning a gaping hole in the pockets of middle class, which is forcing many to cut down consumption of onion. Prices in the wholesale and retail markets have more than doubled in just one week and are expected to increase more in the coming days.Onion prices in the city are ruling anywhere between `40 and `50 per kilo on Friday, as against `10 to `15 per kilo last week. Rythu Bazaars are selling them for `28 per kilo.Last time it was tomatoes and now it is onions, both are essential ingredients. With the rise in the prices we are forced to increase our monthly vegetable budget, Y Sujatha Reddy, a homemaker from Mehdipatnam, said. As per the data maintained by onion wholesale market in Malakpet, the city has a supply of nearly 12,000 bags ie 6,000 quintals per day. And the sudden increase in the prices can be attributed to low production and supply from Maharashtra and other neighbouring states.Almost 90 per cent supply comes from Maharashtra and 10 per cent from erstwhile Mahbubnagar district and some parts of Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh, said J Ananthaiah, selection grade officer at Malakpet wholesale market.And if wholesalers are to be believed, big traders in Maharashtra are deliberately holding up the stock for weeks in cold storage, which is resulting in the huge hike. To get more profit, traders are holding the stock and creating an artificial scarcity.Actually, compared to past years, production of onion is very high in Maharashtra this year, said a wholesale dealer in Malakpet. Meanwhile, prices of tomatoes have come down drastically compared to last few months. On Friday, tomatoes were being sold at between `43 and `50 per kilo as against `90 per kilo in July."

That's why our shawarma is distinctly Damascene,"" Abulezz said proudly.""We even add a Damascene marinade to the roasted chicken -- a secret recipe that no one knows here.""The blend hails from his family's restaurant in Daraya, one of the first towns to revolt against Syria's government when protests broke out in 2011.At the time, Abulezz left university to join rebels defending Daraya, which soon came under crippling government siege.But in August 2016, he was among thousands of fighters and civilians bussed out of the town to opposition-held Idlib after a settlement with the regime.'Good old days of Daraya'Tens of thousands of people have been displaced to Idlib province under similar ""reconciliation"" deals ending government siege and bombardment in exchange for rebels and other residents leaving.About two months ago, Abulezz opened up Sultan Daraya in Idlib city.He now boasts seven employees: five from Daraya, another from third city Homs which the government also recaptured after rebel evacuations, and Abu Ali, from Eastern Ghouta near Damascus.As he shaved chicken slices from the spit, 25-year-old Abu Ali crooned a nostalgic ode to Damascus.""Most of my customers are people from Madaya, Zabadani, Daraya, and Moadamiyet al-Sham,"" Abulezz said, listing towns around Damascus under ""reconciliation"" deals.""Everyone from the capital's suburbs has chased these Damascene specialties,"" he said.Indeed, Daraya natives were flocking to Abulezz's restaurant on the day of AFP's visit.Abu Hamdan, a furniture seller living in Atmeh near the border with Turkey, said he eats at Sultan Daraya ""just to remember the smell of Damascus.""""Coming to these restaurants reminds us of Daraya, of its people and their food. Being displaced is like sucking the soul out of the body,"" the 50-year-old said.Carpenter Abu Imad, 50, is also a regular visitor.""I come to Idlib city every time I need to buy some merchandise, so we drop by friends from our hometown,"" Abu Imad said.""I don't have a favourite dish. I come here to remember, to go back to the good old days of Daraya.""Daraya-style falafelAlong the same street lies Ibad al-Rahman's Damascene Delicacies, which dishes out hummus, fava beans drizzled in olive oil, and deep-fried falafel.The owner, 22-year-old Mohammad Nuh, also imported his succulent recipes from his family's restaurant in Daraya.""When I was 10, my father had a restaurant in Daraya. My brothers and I used to work there, which is where I learned the trade,"" he told AFP.""I prepare the food here the exact same way.""Inside, his three employees are cubing fresh tomatoes, chopping parsley bouquets, and dipping mashed chickpea mixtures into sizzling olive oil to make falafel.""I had to go into debt to open up this restaurant. It took a lot of hard work, but finally I have my own place,"" Nuh said.""It was a coincidence that we all ended up on this street. Most of us didn't know each other before, but we opened several different businesses,"" he said.Just like Sultan Daraya, Nuh's restaurant attracts customers whose palates are used to Damascene flavours.""Idlibis love hot sauce so much -- they put it on everything. This ruins the food,"" Nuh said.""We're introducing them to new recipes so they can actually taste the dish and its ingredients.""One regular is Abu Mukhtar, who hails from Madaya, another town near Damascus that has been evacuated.""We Damascenes are known for our love of good food, which we always found in local restaurants in Daraya, Madaya, or other areas in the suburbs,"" said Abu Mukhtar.The lanky, silver-haired Syrian teamed up with other Madayans to establish a supermarket named after their beloved hometown.""We decided with neighbouring businesses also owned by displaced people that we'll shop at each others' places for mutual benefit."""

TGI Fridays is now hosting VEg Fiesta, that features exotic American and Tex-Mex delicacies.Thankfully this casual dining restaurants idea of vegetarian food festival did not mean binging on paneer. FYI to pubs in Bengaluru, replacing chicken with paneer doesnt exactly cut it.The menu includes Mexican Vegetable Platter  an assortment of cauliflower wings, balsamic grilled mushroom veggie skewers, vegetali tostados, served with garlic bread and New Orleans Corn Cob and choice of side from Pasta Puttanesca and Caesar Salad.Portobello, Bean and Quinoa Burger is well seasoned, with flavours of spiced bean and quinoa patty and the really soft bun making it a delicious bite. I am definitely going back for the buttery rich Multigrain Brioche Bun and the pan seared Portobello mushroom. What a burger!The crunchy Franks Red Cauliflower Wings is my idea of the vegetable fried with spicy batter. However, this one a bit too sour to my liking and was served with a sauce, which too was sour. I would pass on this one.The Sizzling Portobello and Aubergine Fajita was one juicy succulent bite to dig into. Okay, now lets talk about this delicious bite, shall we? It has the grilled marinated Portobello mushroom with grilled spicy eggplant served on a skillet of roasted onions, red and green capsicum.The fajita has a dose of the good carbs with flaky tomato flavoured rice. Yes, I would go back for the fajitas. Any day. Pico de gallo and guacamole were offered as toppings.The Funghi Trifolati Truffled Pizza too has marinated Portobello mushroom slices cooked in Truffle oil. The pizza is a thin crust one, topped with olives, cherry tomatoes and a dollop of mozzarella. It is pretty decent on the taste part. I was too busy fishing mushroom slices off the pizza.Am I a mushroom fanatic? Well, may be.Milkshake paradiseThe restaurant is also has a new Franken Shakes menu where shakes go wild on Fridays. We tried the Whole Lotta Cho-co-lat and boy, was it beyond our imagination delicious. The decadent chocolate milkshake topped with whipped cream is topped with brownie, chocolate doughnut and chocolate sauce. Yup, this drink should in fact be illegal. And I am not even done describing it yet. The glass in which the shake is served is covered with frozen fosting with chocolate chips and Hersheys Kisses embedded on it.

In the vegetarian part of the starters menu, the croquette were equal parts crunchy on the outside and goeey delicious on the inside.Among cocktails, the whiskey infused in tea, served chill was an interesting combination, but did fall back on the blend and the alcohol punch. The Hot Toddy is warm and soothing, but missed a brandy punch.And now that you have read through the starters, lets take a minute to talk about the bhindi, shall we? The Bendakaya Pulusu is hands down the best bhindi with tamarind curry combination I have had so far. The tamarind based gravy has the typical Indian curry texture with the sourness of the tamarind and tomatoes. And the ladies finger pieces soaks in the spicy tamarind curry flavours and makes for a delicious bite with naan. Save butter garlic naan for the non vegetarian curry, Id say.The Murgh Musallam, a Mughlai style chicken curry in the restaurant is rich and creamy. The onion based gravy underplays the spice tadka in the dish and tastes buttery instead. No complaints though.The aromatic Mutton Rogan Josh has rich Kashmiri flavours with delicate lamb chunks. The Chicken Biriyani came in as a colourful ensemble of rice cooked well, but was served cold. The Dal Makhani on the other hand was another star on the dinner table.The red kidney beans and black gram cooked with plenty of butter and spices was really smooth, creamy on the palate and yes, I asked for a second serving of this delicious Punjabi dal that stuck true to its roots.The cheesecake served with a side of blueberries sauce has balanced flavours of cream and cheese and has a chocolate chunk topping that adds crunch to the dessert.Place: Nook - Aloft Bengaluru Cessna Business Park, BellandurCost for two: `2000"

Moshe was two years old when the attack happened.""Ahead of the visit, both countries have prepared a roadmap of joint economic undertakings,"" the Haaretz reported on June 29, 2017. ""The Israeli cabinet approved a 23-page document continuing scores of bilateral measures and a budget of 280 million shekels (about $79.6 million or Rs 514 crore)  a bigger sum than Israel has ever set aside for China, Africa and Latin America combined. No fewer than 11 ministries were involved in preparing the programme.""Here are five things that define the India-Israel relationship today:India is Israel's top destination for arms exports, buying 41 per cent of export between 2012 and 2016, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, an independent global conflict and arms-research institute.Israel is India's third-largest source of arms, with a 7.2 per cent share of imports between 2012 and 2016, next to the US (14 per cent) and Russia (68 per cent).The earliest signs of collaboration came during the 1962 Sino-Indian war, when Israel provided India military aid. Israel also assisted India during two wars with Pakistan in 1965 and 1971.India reciprocated during the six-day war in 1967 by providing Israel with spare parts for French-made Mystere and Ouragan aircraft as well as AX-13 tanks (also French-made).The highlight of the partnership was Israel's supply of artillery shells during the Kargil war in 1999 when India faced a shortage.In the late 1990s, a crucial defence deal was the Indian purchase of Barak 1, an air-defence missile, bought specifically for its capability to intercept US-made Harpoon missiles deployed by Pakistan.India's imports of unarmed aerial vehicles (UAVs) have almost all been from Israel. Of 176 UAVs purchased from Israel, 108 are Searcher UAVs and 68 are Heron UAVs.In April 2017, India and Israel signed a $2 billion deal for an advanced medium-range surface-to-air missile system, which will provide the Indian army the capability to shoot down aircraft, missiles and drones at ranges of up to 70 km.In September 2016, tests were conducted of the jointly developed Long Range Surface-to-Air Missile with a range of 70 km, intended to equip three guided-missile destroyers of the Indian Navy.India successfully tested the Israeli-made SPYDER quick-reaction surface-to-air missile in May this year. The Indian Air Force (IAF) is planning to deploy this system on its western border.India and Israel also closely cooperate on counter-terrorism issues through a joint working group on counter-terrorism.Several ministerial and high-level official visits to Israel preceded Modi's tour. These included visits by then Home Minister LK Advani in 2000, former President APJ Abdul Kalam in 2008, Home Minister Rajnath Singh in 2014, President Pranab Mukherjee in 2015 and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj in 2016.Three Indian naval ships, destroyer INS Mumbai, frigate INS Trishul and tanker INS Aditya, made a goodwill visit at the Haifa port in May 2017 to mark 25 years of full diplomatic relations between the two countries.An Indo-Israel agriculture action plan for 2015-18 is operational, and 15 of the proposed 26 centres of excellence in agriculture are being developed in India with Israel's help to showcase the latest technology to Indian farmers.Phase-I (2010-12) and phase-II (2012-15) of the agreement are complete, according to a reply to the Lok Sabha.India has benefited from Israeli technologies in horticulture mechanisation, protected cultivation, orchard and canopy management, nursery management, micro-irrigation and post-harvest management, particularly in Haryana and Maharashtra.Every year, more than 20,000 farmers visit the Agricultural Centre of Excellence at Gharaunda in Karnal, Haryana, where a nursery produces hybrid seedlings  including tomatoes, cherry-tomato, colored capsicum, cucumbers, eggplant and chilli pepper-grown in small, individual cells, ready to be transplanted into containers or a field.There was a five-to 10-fold increase in crop yields with an accompanying 65 per cent reduction in use of water and noticeable decrease in the use of pesticides and fertilisers, according to a December 2014 report on the Indo-Israel Agriculture Project.On June 28, 2017, the Union cabinet approved a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Israel on the National Campaign for Water Conservation in India.Technologically-adept Israel has developed water-management technologies, located as it is in a semi-arid region with limited sources of fresh drinking water.India and Israel had earlier signed an MoU on water resources management and development cooperation in November 2016.Israel was India's 38th-largest trading partner, with trade of $5.02 billion (Rs 33,634 crore) in 2016-17, down 18 per cent over 2012-13. The trade balance stood in India's favour at $1.10 billion (Rs 7,370 crore) in 2016-17.Mineral fuels and oils are India's leading export to Israel, worth $1.01 billion in 2016-17.India's major imports from Israel in 2016-17 included natural or cultured pearls and precious stones, worth $1.11 billion.Trade in diamonds accounts for nearly 54 per cent of the bilateral trade. Nearly 40 diamond dealers from India have opened offices at the Israeli diamond exchange in Ramat-Gan. Some of these dealers have been active in Israel for nearly 30-40 years.The Israeli government has proposed measures such as ""offering export insurance, liberalising the aviation sector and granting longer-term visas"". The aim is to boost Israeli exports to India by 25 per cent over the next four years and tourists to 80,000 annually.""Relations with Israel are significant for India because of cooperation in agriculture, defence and science/technology,"" Uttara Sahasrabuddhe, professor of international relations at the University of Mumbai, told IndiaSpend.""Israel has been giving key weapons systems to India, including missiles; it has given us those weapons which we could not directly buy from the US for ideological reasons; cooperation in counter-terrorism from information sharing to techniques/doctrine of counter terrorism,"" Sahasrabudde said. ""It is also an important source of foreign investment, if tapped with care. The visit of the Indian PM will indicate that New Delhi has come out of the old mindset."""

So, she, along with her husband Stalin Kalidoss, launched `myHarvest' project that is helping city dwellers grow their own chemical-free green vegetables and fruits in their homes.In her 1,000-sq-ft terrace garden in KK Nagar, they have been growing vegetables like eggplants, spinach, bittergourd, beans, cabbages, okra, peppers, green chillies and other vegetables for the past three years now. "" After working with organic farmers and experts who understand how kitchen terrace garden works, we decided to venture into something that helps others eat fresh and healthy like we do. This is how `myHarvest' started. Once someone approaches us, we go and visit their place to understand what kind of vegetables they can grow in their space. Then the customer purchases a package that contains soil, seeds, fertilizers and other necessary equipment required for setting up a terrace or kitchen garden. Our job is to set up the garden in their house and guide them how to take care of it,"" explains Archana.They prepare the soil and fertilisers like panchagavya , source seeds from the local suppliers and organic vendors in Chennai. They are also working with schools, colleges and corporates to make them understand the concept of growing their own veggies.For 54-year old Christie Manohar, agriculture is not new. She has grown up watching her parents growing their own vegetables in their backyard, using organic manure. Recalling the childhood memories, Christie shares, ""My mother used to pluck vegetables and cook for all of us."" It was in the month of May this year when she came across an advertisement in a newspaper that said the state government was selling saplings, manure and sack bags at concession price. ""This is just a start, if it goes well, we will try organic farming in our five-acre land in Padappai town. All of us in the family are interested in gardening.We use neem oil, soapy water and plain water solutions to spray on the plants to keep them insect-free. To start your own kitchen garden, one need to invest a minimum of `600 to maximum `1,500,"" she shares.There's tender okra, tomatoes, green chillies, radish, eggplants and bitter-gourd in her 200-sq-ft terrace garden in Shanthi Colony, Anna Nagar. ""Just two weeks ago, Amma cooked spinach she had grown on her the terrace garden for two consecutive days. She was excited as it was the first vegetable she grew on her own at home.

From Rs. 110 a kg, the price came down to Rs. 55 and below a few days after hundreds of groups shared the message, said architect S. Gopakumar of Better Kochi Response Group. The campaign titled No Tomato Week began on July 22 and went on till July 30 in the initial phase. Mr. Gopakumar said the initiative was on the lines of a tradition followed in Japan, wherein they stop consuming commodities whose prices go up exponentially. This leads to a fall in their prices, he said.The WhatsApp group message urged all members to either stop or minimise consumption of tomato just for a week or 10 days. The aim was to demoralise hoarders. Members said the prices had slumped within 10 days of the start of the campaign. This group activity to check price rise can be implemented on a long-term basis, Mr. Gopakumar said.Meanwhile, residents associations here are also using social media to instantaneously circulate messages on relevant issues. A. Ajithkumar, general secretary of Ernakulam District Residents Association Apex Council, said at least seven WhatsApp groups were active at the zonal level.Residents have formed groups to share photographs and news on poor infrastructure in their respective localities.

Rain that wreaked havoc in Gujarat and Maharashtra has affected the supply to the city, traders said.Onions were priced at Rs. 40/kg in retail market on Wednesday and this may further go up, note traders.The Koyambedu wholesale market receives only half of the normal onion loads of 65 trucks daily. The city mainly receives its stock from Maharashtra and Gujarat apart from Karnataka.With the floods damaging crops in those States, less than half of the produce is reaching the city. Moreover, stocks from Karnataka are also being diverted to other places in north India like Delhi and Mumbai where the demand is high, traders said.Onions are priced up to Rs. 35 per kg in the wholesale market due to the increasing shortage, said P.Sukumar, joint secretary, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants Association. Cabbage, a vegetable that is usually cheap, has become dearer as truck loads are being diverted to north India.Price of tomatoes downThough cost of tomatoes is steadily dipping, it still remains out of reach for many consumers and is priced up to Rs. 68 per kg in retail stores. S. Chandran, a wholesale merchant, said the market has started getting fresh supply of tomatoes from Hosur belt and this has brought down the price. But, we may have to wait till December for the onions to cost less as produce from Andhra Pradesh may arrive only then. Cost of onions may even go up to Rs. 60 a kg in retail market, he said.The supply scenario at Koyambedu wholesale complex is significant as several small markets in Chennai and other places such as Tindivanam, Cuddalore and Vandavasi depend on this wholesale hub for their supply. The sudden surge in prices of vegetables and off-season for weddings have also contributed to dull sales in the market. It may one or two months for sales to pick up, traders said."

Rajendran, president of Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants Association.The wholesale price of tomato is Rs. 40 a kg, small onion Rs. 70 a kg and big onion Rs. 30 a kg. Beans, carrot, yam and okra are all Rs. 40 a kg. In the case of chilli, it is Rs. 50 a kg. The prices of tomato and small onion are expected to come down and that of big onion go up, he says.Poor rainfallThe main reason for the spiralling prices is poor rainfall, say vegetable traders.There is no shortage in availability of vegetables and the demand has not reduced much because of the prices. Even in places where the rain has been good now, it will take three months for arrivals to start from these areas.Most of the arrivals to Coimbatore now are from other States.Further, there are restrictions to avoid overloading of trucks and transport costs are up, adding to the prices of the vegetables, Mr. Rajendran says.Hoteliers, domestic consumers and bulk buyers are affected equally. Even a domestic consumer needs four or five varieties of vegetables a day. Tomatoes and onions are essential. If the prices continue to remain high, it will bring down the volume of purchase.Usually, prices are down during this period. Arrivals from different parts of the State are not there now and most of the vegetables come from other States. Though hotels buy directly from farmers, availability is down this year because of monsoon failure, says D. Srinivasan, president of Coimbatore District Hoteliers Association. The volume of vegetables used cannot be reduced and there are no substitutes to replace some vegetables. Hence, hotels are finding it difficult to manage. Business is down 30 % since the implementation of GST, he says.The demand for vegetables will go up next month as the festival season starts and this might lead to further increase in prices, adds Mr. Rajendran."
5a0f51649855b76bf13d7e3f,are vegetable prices soaring?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/are-vegetable-prices-soaring/article19527329.ece,2017-08-20,,The Hindu,"What happened in July?July saw a rise in inflation at the wholesale level to 1.88% from 0.9% in June, with the spiralling tomato prices, along with other food items, contributing significantly to this rise. Tomatoes saw a sharp inflation of over 209.5% in July against contraction of 29.4% in June, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. Brinjal registered a rise in inflation to 21.1% in July, from Junes contraction of 3.1%. The prices of tomato, onion and potato have increased in recent months owing to disparity between demand and supply on account of a drop in production because of unfavourable weather, a rise in transport costs, seasonality and supply chain constraints.Why is supply low?While the rise in the retail prices of tomato is being associated with low supply from key growing States, including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka following heavy rain in a few regions that damaged the crop and hindered transport as well, onion prices have seen a rise on account of low supply from the southern States.The fluctuation in vegetable prices, which is commonly referred to as seasonal, is associated with the economics of demand and supply. The Centre maintains that seasonal fluctuations in market arrivals have hit supplies. The other reasons for the fall in supply are adverse weather conditions and imperfections in marketing channels. However, the clash of interests between the consumer, the producer and the middlemen is a key factor that policy-makers must urgently address.Where is the problem?For years, the consumer, the producer (farmer) and the middleman have had a clash of interest when it comes to agricultural commodities. While the consumer wants to buy a commodity at the lowest price, the producer (farmer) desires to sell the produce at the maximum price. The middleman, on the other hand, wants to maximise profits. Striking a balance among these stakeholders could possibly address the issue of price fluctuation to some extent. Vegetable producers, especially small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. As vegetables find their way to the market, the cost of packaging, grading, transporting and fees, besides the margins of the middlemen, are some of the elements that determine the final price the consumer has to bear.Will better storage help?Agricultural commodities with a short shelf-life are prone to price fluctuation and hence require better infrastructure for marketing.Economists like Prof. M.S. Sidhu at Punjab Agricultural University believe that improved transport and upgraded storage infrastructure will keep a check on price volatility. Indias cold storage capacity at present is nearly 3.5 crore tonnes, which is short by 30-40 lakh tonnes, and it needs to be increased. Besides, cold storages need to be upgraded, equipping them to store fruit and vegetables at right temperatures so that they stay fresh.Also, the high cost of transport needs to be addressed. In the case of perishable vegetables, the government could consider promoting low-cost refrigerated trucks and weigh the option of freight subsidy.According to an estimate, there are 7,000-8,000 refrigerated trucks plying in India, mostly transporting pharmaceuticals and dairy products. Transport of perishable vegetables in refrigerated trucks could be one of the options that would help in better supply and availability of the produce.What about the supply chain?The mismanagement in the supply chain is another reason for the huge gap in prices that growers sell perishable agricultural commodities for and what the consumer pays. Creation of co-operative groups and societies are probably an alternative that could assist in minimising the marketing channel. They can work in tandem across the States and supply vegetables from surplus regions to places where the produce is in demand.Most farmers in India have small landholdings. Nearly 85% farmers are small, who have less than 2 hectares. Cultivation has become unviable for these small farmers, but through cooperative groups and societies even a small quantity of crop produced by the farmer can be marketed. This will stabilise prices and benefit consumers.VIKAS VASUDEVA"

To spread this message and to encourage people to go green, we are holding workshops for kids where they can learn how to make clay Ganeshas,"" said Sowmya Reddy, a civic leader from Bangalore Political Action Committee (B.PAC). It had earlier conducted green Ganesha workshops in seven wards and is set to hold them in five more wards.Meanwhile, a group of four friends has taken the concept of green Ganesha to the next level, by coming up with an idol which, on immersion, sprouts a plant. The Sasya Ganapathi kit, developed by Sudhakar M, Bharath Srinivas, Punith Kumar and Vivek N Kumar, includes an idol made of clay, potting mix and organic fertilizer and is painted with natural colours. There's also a terracotta-coloured plastic pot, a nutrient block which expands up to 10 litres of soil, and a packet of organic seeds (tomato, lady finger or holy basil).During the ceremony, the pot must be filled with water and the idol placed in it. The nutrient block should also be added to the pot. In a day's time, the soil block would have expanded and covered the pot. Once this happens, the seeds can be sown, ensur ing over time the Ganesha transforms into a plant.Each kit is being sold for Rs 1,501 and they are being shipped across the country.""When we started this year, we thought we'd only be able to sell 250-300 kits. However, we have sold 1,000 kits across India,"" said Sudhakar.Then there is Green My Life, an online garden store which too sells idols that, on immersion, grow into plants.""Along with the idol, we are giving the buyer a grow bag, coco peat and a packet of seeds. This way , the Ganesha can stay with you in your home,"" said Gitanjali Ramani, founder and CEO.The online platform is also selling do-it-yourself Ganeshas.For Rs 550, you can get the clay, a pot, natural paint and an instruction manual to create your own Ganesha. ""Last year, we got about 2,000 orders for green Ganeshas. As we hadn't expected so many orders, we couldn't meet the demand. We have increased supply this year,"" said Gitanjali.""Since last year, we have been using clay Ganeshas.We immerse the idols in a big drum within the apartment premises and the water is then used in the garden,"" said B S Raghavendra, a member of the Forthouse RWA, Kodigehalli.JP Nagar 6th Phase too seems to be going green. "" Aware of the harmful effects of PoP idols, people in our area have switched to clay and mud Ganeshas,"" said Dhananjaya Padmanabhachar, a resident.Meera Arun, who lives in Banashankari, has been organizing workshops for the past two years on the importance of switching to mud and clay idols and how to make them. ""We've stuck posters in the locality, telling people to say no to plasterpaintedglazed idols. We are urging them to get clay idols not more than 3ft tall, and immerse them in buckets in their garden itself. We'll also speak to street vendors, asking them not to leave festival waste on roads. They should pile them up neatly on the sides for BBMP workers to clear it the next day,"" she said.At a time when the government and civic bodies are facing flak for the city's degenerating waterbodies, it's the citizens and their collective efforts in the right direction that could make a lasting difference.Growing awareness about the ruinous effects of Plaster of Paris idols on lakes is driving Bengalureans to opt for greener versions of the elephant god.Even better is the concept of clay idols that could sprout plants later. While the authorities pass the buck to cover up their failures in saving Bengaluru's lakes, it's heartening to see a proactive citizenry cheerily lead by example."

Lot of plantain trees were destroyed due to drought in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, and as a result there is huge scarcity of bananas, especially Nendran variety, which is mainly sourced from Mettupalayam.""Though there are plantation cultivations in Wayanad, Thrissur and Ernakulam, it is not sufficient to cater the needs and demands of shopkeepers and customers,"" said A Siddique, secretary of banana market stall association.In addition to Onam, Chingam is a season of weddings. As a result, the prices of bananas as well as plantain leaves are likely to shoot up in the coming days, the shopkeepers said.At present, the price of plantain leaves ranges from Rs 3 to 5 per leaf.""We usually get bulk orders from hotels and for wed dings and feasts. With Onam round the corner, offices, educational institutions and organizations have started ordering plantain leaves in a bulk. We rely on neighbouring states like Tamil Nadu for plantain leaves. The problem is that we are not getting enough leaves to meet the demands,"" said Paul and John, a vendor at Ernakulam market.Apart from bananas, the price of banana chips is also skyrocketing. The cost of a kilo of banana chips ranges from Rs 280-300 in Kochi.Sharkara Upperi (Jaggerycoated chips) is priced at around Rs 300 per kg, while masala banana chips cost Rs 320 and sweet banana chips at Rs 200.""It's not just the Malayalis who like banana chips, but people from other states also buy these chips. So the demand is pretty much high for chips in general. In addition to that, increase in price of Nendran banana and edible oil has also contributed to the rise in price,"" said M Latheef of Calicut Bakery."

Vegetables sold include those certified as produced using Good Agricultural Practices (GAP).'Onasamridhi' during the last Onam season had witnessed sale of around 4,800 metric tonnes of vegetables over five days, out of which 3,400 metric tonnes were state's own produce.The `Onathinu oru muram pachakkari' scheme which envisages mass cultivation of vegetables with the participation of 63 lakh families, would address the demand only partially. The department's calculation is that it might require 5,207 MT vegeta bles to run these stalls. To fill the gap, Horticorp has been entrusted to procure 940 MT of vegetables from neighbouring states.""For the mass cultivation scheme under which people could raise vegetables in their backyards, on terraces and in grow bags, we had distributed seeds or seedlings of only around five types of vegetables (ladies finger, spinach, snake gourd, brinjal, bitter gourd and chilli). It was meant to create awareness on safe-to-eat vegetables and to boost consumers' confidence,"" said agriculture director A M Sunil Kumar.Envisaged as part of the Haritha Kerala Mission and implemented with the cooperation of Kudumbashree units, homemakers, students, workers under the employment guarantee scheme, vegetable farmers' clusters, officials and various institutions, the scheme had witnessed distribution of 63 lakh packets of seeds, 45 lakh vegetable seedlings, and more than one lakh grow bags.Whether the scheme achieved its aim of cultivating a habit of us ing safe-to-eat vegetables is yet to be seen. However, the increase in the number of vegetable stalls this Onam is huge. The depart ment had run 1,365 outlets last year. This has been made possible by introducing sale of vegetables in cooperation department fairs, Supplyco fairs and Kudum bashree outlets, the director pointed out.Among the 1,500 stalls to be run directly by the department in association with Vegetables and Fruits Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) and Horticorp are 51 eco-shops selling its own brand of organic vegetables 'Kerala Organic', which had hit the market last Vishu . ""All other outlets too will be selling organic or GAP-certified vegetables at a price that is bit higher,"" Sunil Kumar said.Locally grown vegetables will be procured from farmers by Hor ticorp at a 10% higher price, while the farmers will get 20% high price for GAP-cer tified products. At the stalls, the con sumers can buy them availing 30% and 10% discounts respectively. ""Be sides vegetables, the stalls will be selling the fa mous Marayoor jaggery, coconut oil and honey,"" the agriculture director said.The department is hoping to procure 150 tonnes of best qual ity garlic with great medicinal value from Kanthalloor-Vatta vada belt. The area famed for vegetable cultivation will provide a significant volume of cabbage, potato and cauliflower, for which the state has been depending heavily on neighbouring states.Majority of the vegetables to be purchased by Horticorp from other states are the ones not grown in the state. Kerala grows only around 15 types of vegeta bles out of 50 in demand. ""The cultivation of tomato, which was widespread in Palakkad district, has come down, and we need to procure it from outside,"" Sunil Kumar said."

Improvements in performance at the mining and electricity sectors buoyed the index, with expansion in the mining sector at 4.8%, up from 0.4% in June.The electricity sector grew 6.5% in July, accelerating from 2.1% in the previous month.Manufacturing, however, grew only 0.1%. Still, this was an improvement from Junes 0.4% contraction.Not out of woodsAlthough the IIP has improved compared to the previous month, the level is still very low, so it cannot be taken as a symptom of a turnaround in the economy, said D.K. Srivastava, chief policy advisor at EY India. The electricity and mining sectors are largely driven by the governments own demand. Some improvement was expected because of the governments own expenditure.And if you combine this with the fact that CPI inflation has also started to rise, the economy is still not out of the woods, Mr. Srivastava added.With retail inflation now edging closer to the Reserve Bank of Indias upper bound for price gains, economists see reduced prospects for any immediate interest rate cut by the central bank.Notably, core and non-core inflation gauges have jumped in the month, driven by higher transport, housing and possibly transient impact from price changes due to the GST roll-out (eg. health), Radhika Rao, India Economist at DBS Bank, wrote in an emailed statement. With August headline inflation on the higher end of the central banks 2-3.5% target for the first half of the current fiscal year, any lingering expectations for an October rate cut were likely to be doused, she wrote.While the uptick in CPI inflation was in line with expectations, the broad-based rise in core CPI inflation was a cause for some concern, according to Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ratings agency ICRA.However, some food price gains were likely to moderate this month relieving some inflationary pressure, Ms. Nayar wrote in an emailed note.Prices of various vegetables such as tomatoes and, to a smaller extent, potatoes, have eased in month-on-month terms so far in September 2017, which would contain the uptick in food inflation in the current month, Ms. Nayar wrote. In addition, prices of onions, while still high, have retreated from the peak recorded in late-August.The fuel and light segment witnessed a marginal quickening: at 4.94% from 4.86% in July. The housing segment saw an acceleration in inflation to 5.58% from 4.98%.The staggered impact on the housing index of the CPI, of the revision in HRA (house rent allowance) of central government employees, is likely to continue to push up housing inflation further over the coming year, Ms. Nayar wrote.While the overall primary goods category of IIP grew 2.3% in July, rebounding from a contraction of 0.2% in June, the capital goods sector continued to contract, shrinking by 1% in July following Junes 6.8% contraction. Consumer durables, too, contracted in July, by 1.3%, compared with a contraction of 2.1% in June.Weak demandIndustrial output remained weak despite the possible positives from restocking showing demand impulses still remained subdued, wrote Richa Gupta, senior economist, Deloitte.The big ticket manufacturing sector has continued to underperform, she wrote. Investment demand remains weak as capital goods production continued to contract. While the festival season could see some demand revival, any meaningful recovery may take longer to take hold, Ms. Gupta added."

5a11065b9855b76bf13dbb53,Farm livelihoods: beware of RCEP,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/629065/farm-livelihoods-beware-rcep.html,2017-08-20,,Deccan Herald,"By Devinder Sharma, Aug 20 2017, 23:08 ISTIt was always known, but when a United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) report in 2003 explained in detail how devastating cheaper imports of agricultural commodities and products have been to domestic production, and presented a chart detailing out how a surge in imports acted as a strong blow to the local economy, I thought the world would sit back and take notice.On the contrary, international trade negotiations have now taken a more aggressive stance. More and more opening up of the trade barriers has destroyed millions of livelihoods in the bargain.Lets examine what is at stake. Over the past few decades, especially after 1995 when the World Trade Organisation (WTO) came into existence, the effort has been to force developing countries to remove trade barriers and import duties.According to FAO, when imports of tomato paste increased by 15 times in Senegal, local production declined by 50%; when vegetable oil imports doubled in Jamaica, it recorded a 68% cut in domestic production.In India, too, when imports of vegetable oils surged between 1993-94 and 2015-16 following a systematic reduction in import duties over the years, India turned from a position of self-sufficiency to become the worlds second biggest importer of edible oils.What was attempted initially through the WTO was aggressively pushed under bilateral Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and regional trade pacts. While numerous studies have shown that India has hardly gained from the opening up of the domestic market, the damage done to agriculture has been enormous.As if this is not enough, a Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) treaty, which concluded its latest round of negotiations in Hyderabad in July, is considering removing import duties on 92% of all traded commodities. Worse, it is believed that a draconian provision whereby the import duties that will be reduced to zero under the treaty cannot be raised later, is being considered, a provision that even the WTO did not impose.In other words, the RCEP treaty, if India agrees to sign, would open up the Indian market for zero import duty for all times to come. It will take away the right from India to protect and ensure the livelihood security of its 600 million farmers. The treaty is being negotiated between 16 countries, including South Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and China.Surprisingly, every time India enters into a trade negotiation, it seeks greater market access for its services, including easier norms for its professionals to move across borders for short-term work.While this is certainly important, one fails to understand why agriculture is being deliberately sacrificed in the bargain. After all, domestic agriculture, which entails the livelihoods of 600 million farmers, cannot be placed on the chopping block of international trade.Grim prospectsTake the case of the dairy sector. According to Jayan Mehta, senior general manager of Amul dairy cooperatives, the livelihoods of 150 million people engaged in dairy farming will be severely if RCEP negotiations continue on current lines.India is the biggest producer of milk in the world. Presently, the import of milk and milk products are allowed with an import duty ranging from 40% to 60%. This provides enough protection for the local dairy industry to build its competitiveness.Opening up the flood gates will inundate India with cheaper milk flowing in from Australia and New Zealand. Let us not forget that while Australia, with only 6,300 dairy farmers and New Zealand, with 12,000, are pushing aggressively to protect the economic interests of their small dairy farming communities, India is willing to sacrifice the livelihoods of 150 million dairy farmers.Since India has a huge domestic demand for milk, it doesnt have the kind of export surplus that Australia and New Zealand have. Just because those countries are willing to provide greater access to Indian IT professionals, should India jeopardize the livelihoods of 150 million dairy farmers?Dairy is not the only commodity for which the market is to open up. India will have to open up for all kinds of fruits, vegetables, pulses, potatoes, spices, plantation crops, seeds, silk, processed foods, etc.Although India is still insisting on allowing zero tariff import on only 80% of the traded goods, and is seeking a three-tier structure, the negotiations are led by the dominant and aggressive stance of countries like China, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea, which will eventually have their say.It has taken so many years for the world to understand that the WTO was designed to serve the commercial interests of only the top 1%. The RCEP treaty, being negotiated without drawing any lessons from the WTO experience, would strike a much severe blow. What was negotiated in the Hyderabad round of talks has not been made public. It is being done in complete secrecy.A few people sitting in heavily guarded negotiations take decisions which eventually impact the future of 99% of the population. This is grossly unfair."
5a1117839855b76bf13dc7cd,India August inflation seen at five-month high on rising food costs: Reuters poll,http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2017/sep/11/india-august-inflation-seen-at-five-month-high-on-rising-food-costs-reuters-poll-1655413.html,2017-09-11,,The New Indian Express,"BENGALURU: India's retail inflation is expected to have picked up to a five-month high in August, largely driven by higher food costs, a Reuters poll showed, easing pressure on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to cut interest rates again after poor growth data.Consumer prices were forecast up at 3.20 percent in August from a year ago, jumping from July's 2.36 percent, according to the poll taken September 5-8 of nearly 40 economists.Forecasts for the data, scheduled to be released on September 12 at 1200 GMT, ranged from 2.50 percent to 3.55 percent.If the consensus is met, it would be the highest since April, but below the RBI's medium-term target of 4.0 percent for the tenth consecutive month.Tushar Arora, an economist at HDFC Bank, said food prices continue to rise in August, mainly driven up by ""unfavorable weather conditions and supply chain constraints.""Food and beverage inflation, which accounts for nearly 50 percent of the consumer price index basket was expected to have rebounded in August after prices fell in the three previous months.Monsoon rains this year have caused damages to crops of some perishable food items and hindered the movement of goods.The resulting hit from a shortage of production and supply of vegetables such as tomatoes and onions - which are basic ingredients in Indian kitchens - suggests inflation will be elevated in coming months.""Looking beyond the forthcoming data for August, price pressures are set to rise further,"" said Shilan Shah, an economist at Capital Economics.Wholesale prices were expected to rise 3.00 percent last month from a year ago, from 1.88 percent in July, the poll forecast.Early last month the Reserve Bank of India cut interest rates - making it the first Asian central bank to ease this year - on a subdued economic outlook.But rising price pressures will complicate the RBI's policy path as the latest data for April-June quarter showed economic growth cooled to a three-year low.""We do not see significant room for monetary policy accommodation given the fact that rates are near their all-time low and inflation is now on a rising trajectory,"" said Teresa John, an economist at stock brokerage Nirmal Bang.Separately, the poll also predicted industrial output rose 1.2 percent in July after contracting in June, despite disruptions caused by a new goods and services tax.That revival was likely led by increased output in the eight core industries - which makes up about 40 percent of overall industrial production."

It also cut its GVA growth forecast to 6.9 per cent from the earlier 7.2 per cent.Stating that the RBI may go for a rate cut at the December review of the policy, BofAML said, ""Although inflation is turning up to 3.1 per cent in August on rising tomato and onion prices and 4.6-4.9 per cent in 1H18, it is still well within the RBI's 2-6 per cent inflation target.""HSBC said there are ""downward risks"" to its growth forecast of 7.1 per cent, while Japanese brokerage Nomura cut its calendar 2017 forecast by 0.20 per cent to 6.7 per cent.""The key question is how soon the economy will recover from the GST-led disruptions,"" Nomura said. The brokerage, however, said that the RBI will hold rates.Analysts at Morgan Stanley said they continue to see a recovery, but the data release poses downward risks to its growth forecasts.""The key risks to the outlook are the impact of weaker monsoon on agricultural output; the pace of NPL resolution, which would affect credit growth; and private capex and global trade conditions,"" it said.India's GDP grew slower at 5.7 per cent during April-June -- the lowest in three years of the Modi government while lagging China for the second straight quarter -- as manufacturing slowed ahead of the GST launch and note ban impact lingered.Gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the first quarter of 2017-18 was lower than 6.1 per cent of the preceding one and 7.9 per cent in the same period last fiscal.China recorded 6.9 per cent growth in January-March as well as April-June quarters.Expressing concern on the GDP numbers, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said manufacturing growth rate seems to have bottomed out as GST has been implemented and destocking of pre-GST stocks is almost complete."

Some of this amount will have to be raised by the charity.Cini aims to cover 1,01,000 tribal households in four states -- Jharkhand, Odisha, Maharashtra and Gujarat -- and make them lakhpatis by 2020 by trebling their income from farming and animal husbandry to Rs 1.2 lakh per annum.In these four states, Cini covers seven blocks in five districts of Jharkhand (East Singhbhum, Hazaribag, Deoghar, Dhumka and Khunti); two blocks in one district of Odisha (Keonjhar); eight blocks in three districts of Gujarat (Mahisagar, Sabarkhantha and Dahod); and two blocks in two districts of Maharashtra (Nadurbar and Dhule).These four states are home to over 65 per cent of the nation's tribal population, Neelam said when asked why only these four states have been covered under its project.""Nearly half-way into the project, we've already created 15,000 lakhpati kisans across these four states,"" he said, adding the number of households that got lifted out of poverty through the high-value agriculture and piggery under the initiative stands at 41,313 now.Neelam said the livelihood enhancement initiative is aimed at trebling their income to Rs 1.2 lakh a year and is based on a four-pronged strategy - high value farming; livestock (primarily piggery and goats); non-timber forest produce like lac and horticulture.The initiative seeks to invest Rs 65,000 into each household of which the Tata Trusts will invest Rs 20,000 each and the rest will come through other agencies, including government grants but arranged through/by the Trusts.He sounded very confident of meeting the overall target of creating over 1.1 lakh lakhpati farmers (by 2020) as the traction in terms of adoption of their methods has been gaining better momentum.""Having already sown the seeds of change among a large number of farmers, who have become the brand ambassadors of the project, our work has become much easier now.""Total households engaged in agriculture stands at 45,740, who do at least two seasons now, while the total additional area brought under irrigation is about 4,973 acres, he said, adding total market-linked vegetable production clusters created stands at 53.While on a recent visit to the tribal-dominated Jharkhand, where Cini seeks to cover over 30,000 households, Cini state manager P Sirshendu said the success of the scheme has so far been beyond their expectation.He said in FY17 alone, more than 27,310 tribal households, spanning 429 villages and consisting of over 2020 self-help groups (SHGs), have benefited from the project.This agency has visited five villages in the Khunti district and met with dozens of farmers who do soilless farming of tomatoes and some other green vegetables.In a village in Khunti, there already are seven lakhpati farmers - all women-- who earn more Rs 1 lakh from farming and piggery. They said before they joined Cini initiatives, their lives were miserable and fully depended on the mercy of rain gods and middlemen.In another village, which is Christian-dominated and whose residents are into cultivation of lac - a natural adhesive used in industries - farmers said their lives have changed very radically after joining the Cini project.At another village, a farmer-turned-entrepreneur runs a hi-tech polyhouse nursery to grow soilless veg saplings.The farmer said he has invested Rs 7 lakh in setting up the nursery of which Rs 1 lakh was his contribution and the rest funded by the project with a condition that first he has to meet the demand from nearby villages only. He said within two years, he has recovered his investment.Cini also involves irrigation (drip and mulching), setting up solar pumps for irrigation, education and sports, especially hockey which includes a world-class hockey training academy at Jamshedpur.The academy has set a target of selecting at least 4-5 kids from the region to play in the Hockey Junior World Cup to be held in 2020.Its education initiative has resulted in dropout rate at Cini schools falling to 2-5 per cent against the state average of 12 per cent, while attendance has shot up to over 80 per cent."

Today she has more than 200 varieties of different plants. I started off with flowers such as the hibiscus and acanthaceae for my pooja room and then one day as I was washing spinach, which I got from the shop, I found a lot of mud and dirt in it. That is when I thought of growing spinach myself, and that became the first vegetable in my garden, she says.Sujatha then went on to grow other vegetables such as green chilli, ladies finger and brinjal. It was only after she came across a group called the Organic Garden Foundation, through a friend of hers, that she started taking terrace gardening seriously. My friend added me to this group and I would see how the members would post pictures of their jasmine, cabbage, carrots and so on. I was really fascinated and this motivated me to expand my garden, she says with a smile.Sujathas terrace offers a scenic beauty with various plants such as pumpkin, tomatoes, carrots, papaya, rudraksh and betel, standing fresh and tall. I treat them like my own children. I talk to them, play music for them and even compliment them, she says, adding, you need to give them back what they give to you.She says that there is immense support and help she gets from her family, friends, and people around her. In my absence, my daughter-in-law sends me pictures of my plants to show me how much they have grown, she says. Similarly my friends, watchman, driver and ironing man, all help me with my garden and get me natural composts such as fruit and vegetable peels, egg shells, ashes from the charcoal, and so on. And it is only with all their help that my garden stands so beautiful today, says Sujatha, adding that she uses only organic compost that is made from kitchen waste, for her garden.Sujatha who lost two of her plants, a fig and pomegranate, says while seeing the struggles of our farmers due to crop failure on the television, we may not feel much for them. But the day I lost two of my plants, I really felt the pain. She has also started the Terrace to Table project. In this, she clicks a photograph of the vegetable from her garden and then a photograph of the dish that she has cooked with it, and then posts it on her organic garden group."

My mother used to cook for a joint family and she was my first trainer. I still remember some of her tricks and tips...even now, every day, she asks me if Ive eaten properly (smiles).I started my career in 1990 at Taj Manjarun, Mangalore where I replaced my elder brother and worked there till 1998. This is where I first ventured into seafood specialities. From 1999 to 2008, I worked in Karavalli, a coastal restaurant in Bengaluru. Karavalli specialised in Goan, Kerala, Mangalore, Karwar and basically coastal cuisines and I took it as an opportunity to polish my skills with seafood. I have participated in food festivals across the country like Taj Bengal, Calcutta in 2003, Taj Banjara, Hyderabad in 2005 and other esteemed establishments like Blue Diamond, Pune and Taj Residency, Delhi. In 2009, I joined Raintree, Anna Salai and I am the sous chef there.My speciality is coastal cuisines and seafood from Kerala, Goa and Mangalore. My favourite dishes that I make best arecrab porichathu and Syrian Chicken curry. But I vote steamed neer dosai with coconut milk as my comfort food. Neer dosai is a popular breakfast in the rural areas of Mangalore. I love to cook for my family, especially my children. I am happy when my customers compliment my dishes andask me to teach them the recipes. I do everything in my capacity to ensure that the guests feel at home and they get what they request.I feel that the use of molecular gastronomy is not a bad thing at all. It has got some negative publicity due to isolated incidents that happened due to incomplete knowledge and inadequate assistance. It creates an entirely new and fun experience for the customers so if there is enough information, why not? Although I would suggest to avoid letting very young kids try it.I am very particular about wasting food and ensure that I discuss with my customers before cooking and always cook according to portions to avoid wastage. To people who are new to cooking, I would a saystart slow and gradually move on to more advanced techniques. Anybody who is interested in cooking can learn with time and remember to put your heart and soul into every dish.CRAB PORICHATHUIngredientsIngridientsOnion ,finely chopped 1Tomato,finely chopped 3Ginger Garlic Paste 1 tspTurmeric Powder  tspChilly Powder 1 tspCoriander Powder  tspCurry Leaves 10 gmCoriander Leaves 10 gmSalt To tasteOil 15 mlMETHODBring water to boil in a deep vessel.When it comes to a rolling boil, add enough salt and turmeric powder to it.Add the crab to this and cook for 2-3 minutes.

Being from Odisha, my speciality naturally became Odiya cuisine. But I prefer to call myself an Indian chef because I can cook specialities across the country. I acquired my culinary education from IHM, Chennai and started my career at The Residency, Karur. Later, I worked at Accord, Puducherry and now I am at the Paprika cafe in The Courtyard by Marriot, Teynampet.I have been an Oriya speciality chef in all of these establishments. Although I make specialities from across the country, like dal makhni, rogan josh and Awadhi biriyani, I personally prefer Oriya dalma as comfort food. It is made from yellow moong dal and a melange of vegetables. I also like kakhara poi ghanto which is made from plenty of vegetables like pumpkin, spinach, raw papaya, drumstick and potatoes. Maccha besara which is made from fish and other vegetables is also my favourite.Odiya cuisine also features some unique desserts such as chenna pudo, which is a cottage cheese-based dessert sweetened with sugar syrup. Then we have goja which is maida and sugar syrup based dessert. Khassa laddu, which is black sesame seed with jaggery is served after special ceremonies in Odisha. I am against food wastage. Therefore, we cook according to the reservation. Its better to make more if necessary than to end up with excess food.Since we are a business class hotel, the guests tend to stay longer. This gives me the opportunity to build a cordial relationship with them and I try my best to go out of my way to fulfil their requests. If anybody is tired of North Indian cuisine, I make South Indian food for them. I also take custom requests on how they want their food prepared. Recently, a US navy team stayed with us and before they left, they specially asked to meet me. I was hugged and appreciated by all of them for the food and experience we provided them. This is why I love my profession. More than just pleasing peoples taste buds, its about winning their hearts.Machha BesaraIngredientsFish: Rohu or cat fishOnion: 1 big, slicedTomatoes: 2, dicedPotatoes: 1 sliced (optional)Mustard seeds: 50 gm soaked in water for 2-3 hrsGarlic: 3 clovesGinger: 1 inchRed chilli powder: 1 tspTurmeric powder: 1/2 tspSalt to tasteWater: 1.5 cupsOil: around 10 tbspDried mango (Ambula),Curd (1/4 cup)Coriander leavesOnions: 2, chopped1 tbsp cumin-coriander powder1 tsp turmeric powder1 tsp garam masala2-3 bay leaves3-4 tbsp mustard oil1 tsp panch phutana (mix of cumin+mustard+nigella+saunf+fenugreek seeds)MethodGrind mustard seeds, ginger and garlic together to a fine paste.Wash the fish and marinate for 10 mins with 1/2 tsp chilli, pinch of turmeric and pinch of salt.In a frying pan on medium heat, put 3 tbsp of oil and fry the fish until brown on each side.
