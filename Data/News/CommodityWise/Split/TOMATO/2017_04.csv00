Traders at the Koyambedu market noted that 1 kg of tomato costs up to Rs. 45 in the wholesale market and Rs. 5-Rs. 10 more in the retail market.The market gets only around half of its usual 60 truckloads a day.Traders said Koyambedu usually gets tomatoes of different varieties from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. As summer was harsh this time, the yield has been less.S. Chandran, president of Koyambedu Vegetable Market Licensed Merchants Association, said, Many customers are buying only a quarter of what they usually purchase, especially when it comes to tomatoes, carrots and beans that are costly. This has pulled down the sales by 30% in the wholesale market. While carrots cost up to Rs. 55 a kg, beans are priced at Rs. 65. Green peas and small onions are also among the expensive vegetables and are being sold for Rs. 100-Rs. 110 a kg in the wholesale market.Change likelyTraders expect the prices to stabilise slightly when the Tamil month of Aadi begins in mid-July as weddings and functions are not held then and the demand will come down. But tomatoes are likely to cost more till August or September, when the next harvest is due."

The 25-year-old chef heads operations at Le Cirque Signature, at the Leela Mumbai and has created a special food and wine trail thats been inspired by his hometown, Lucca in Tuscany near Florence. The menu includes several family recipes. On Sundays, after mass, my mother would buy fresh seafood and make gamberoni, baked prawns in orange lemon base, Severini cheerfully shares with us.For the chef, Tuscany is the fragrance of rosemary and thyme. And, pecorini reminds me of home, which I havent been in six years, and beef, he grins. Native Tuscans eat simple food, vegetables grown in their backyard, herbs collected from mountains and fresh catch from the sea. They rarely use eggs in their food and their bread is baked without salt. Thats because our cuisine is very powerful. The only challenge I face here is the [in]consistent availability of ingredients. I usually create menus depending on whats available. So many laws change overnight, I cant keep up, he quips, telling us about the one time his vegetables got caught in customs. They were stale by the time I got my hands on them. I sent them back! he exclaims.After a hearty chat, he leaves us to try the food, starting our journey with two types of bruschetta delloste (Rs 1,050). One is a raw tomato, and the other a herby porcini on a pillowy polenta with has a crisp coating. The tomato needs seasoning but the porcini is juicy and gets the taste buds going. The cacciucco alla viareggina (Rs 1050), a seafood soup, has clams, oysters, prawn and chunks of fish in a thick broth which we wash down with a watery Merlot Dazante from the region.In a chat with us, Severini had expressed his concern about creating vegetarian dishes but it feels like needless worry when we taste the gnudi senesi (Rs 1,250). The no-frills dish is a ricotta spinach gnocchi on a bed of tomato puree that woos the palate with every bite. This is how we eat it at home, Severini quips. Next up is tordelli lucchesi rewind (Rs 1,650), is lamb ravioli with a lamb ragout. We savour this with a sangiovese cabernet sauvignon, Castello Banfi.The sommelier for the evening, Margaux Pavoncello, tells us about French grapes that were planted in Tuscan region, giving the wine a distinct character, acquired from the terra. The weather and soil play a very important part in the flavour, she explains, as we sip the medium bodied wine.For our mains, the vegetarians dish is fagotto Florentino (Rs 1,150). The name gets the Florentino title owing to the spinach stuffed in a filo pastry shell with mushrooms. The second dish is the recipe that Severini has borrowed from his mother, the gamberoni arrosto (Rs 2,150) in which succulent prawns sit on orange and lemon mayonnaise base, which gives the dish a much-needed citrusy lift. We wish there was more of this sauce though. A Sangiovese Cabernet Merlot matches the dish, and is a whole bodied, woody experience. While the food shouts Italian yet none of the dishes are clichd presentations. There is barely any use of basil, and its a pleasant change to eat robust Italian dishes.Severini joins us for the dessert course which is cantucci e vin santo (Rs 750). For the custard, I break a Tuscan cigar, which is second best after a Cuban roll, and add it in the food smoking gun, he explains. What looks like slices of bread are cookies kneaded with dryfruits. The server pours the custard, which comes in a thick sauce consistency, over it. The burnt flavour lingers in our mouth, gently offering sweet solace from the cookie in every bite. A traditional recipe that Severini has given his own modern twist.Tuscany Food and Wine Trail ongoing at Le Cirque Signature, The Leela Mumbai, Andheri East till June 30The only challenge I face here is the [in]consistent availability of ingredientsLorenzo SeveriniChef"

Thanks good monsoon, the third advance estimates of foodgrain production is 273.38 million tonnes in 2016-17, higher than the second advance estimates in of 271.98 MT and final estimates of 251.57 MT in 2015-16. Farm growth for the full fiscal has zoomed to 4.9%, compared with a near flat 0.7% expansion in 2015-16. If the forecast of the India Meteorology Department (IMD) for this year holds true, the grain output will set a new record, boosting the growth rate. This is good news for the economy. After two years of back-to-back drought, in 2014-15 and 2015-16, we can look forward acche din (better days) in future.Increased production does not necessary mean more income for farmers. In fact, the pattern of bumper crops and dejected farmers has become a recurring feature of Indian agriculture. Farmers in some states are regretting their abundant yields this year as the prices of agricultural commodities have crashed. Chilli farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, tomato growers in Karnataka and pulses cultivators in Maharashtra are confronted with a severe crisis that has witnessed prices fall by more than half in a matter of just weeks. Even Punjab, known as the granary of India, has turned into a hotspot for farmer suicides. The Centre last month informed the Supreme Court that over 12,000 suicides had been reported in the agricultural sector every year since 2013. The states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu accounted for over 87% of them.According to the Economic Survey 2016-17, the average annual income of a rural household in 17 states is a paltry Rs 20,000, less than the annual mobile bill of some upwardly-mobile citizen in a city. This is primarily because the benefits from his labour are cornered by intermediaries in the market. Instead of the policy obsession with agricultural growth rates, the focus must shift to ensuring fair deal to the farmers. Apart from effective implementation of marketing reforms recently initiated by the Centre through the model Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act, this require more and better managed investment in agriculture. In 2014, the BJP had come to power promising profitability in agriculture by ensuring a minimum of 50% profits over the cost of production, cheaper agriculture inputs and credit, introducing latest technologies for farming and high-yielding seeds, and linking MGNREGA to agriculture. After three years in power, the government is nowhere near even partial fulfilment of those promises."

I started my career in Bengaluru, where my brother also worked as a chef. He taught me all about food. After having spent five years in Bengaluru, I moved to Chennai. I have been working at Chap Chay, The Raintree Hotel, for about six months now.I have been exposed to different varieties of food since my childhood. I have always understood and loved different cuisines and flavours. My brother and the chefs I have worked with in the last 12 years have inspired me. Every place that I have been trained in, I have learned and mastered a different cuisine under some of the best chefs. From Mumbai I learnt Japanese cuisine, a couple of Thai dishes from Bengaluru, from Chennai I learnt a lot of Chinese dishes and from Kolkata I picked up a couple of Cantonese dishes. So every place has made me a better chef and has taught me a lot. My specialities however are my Japanese, Chinese and Thai food.Each cuisine stands apart in terms of authentic flavouring. For example, we use a lot of tangy flavours in Shanghai food and in Cantonese and Chinese dishes we use very little spice. But we adjust the flavours as per the taste of the customers. In Chennai, people prefer more spices and tanginess, so even the authentic Chinese flavours have to be changed.I think my best and also my favourite dishes are dimsums. I also did a dimsum festival at the hotel recently. I love experimenting with dimsums and create new flavours. Broccoli and cheese dimsums, scallop and prawn dimsums, pork bun dimsum, beef dimsums are some of my most favourite varieties. I try out different varieties because nowadays people look for new and unique flavours.I have received a lot of appreciation for my broccoli and cheese dimsums. Mostly people prefer their dimsums with a dip, so I tried a couple of varieties with the kind of dips too. I tried four kinds of dips keeping in mind the kind of flavours and taste that guests want  spring onion and garlic, tangy chilli sauce, roasted sesame sauce and tomato and onion cold sauce."

(Express/Narendra Vaskar) With kharif sowing already at the half-way mark, farmers say the fresh loan may just come too late. (Express/Narendra Vaskar)Even as the Maharashtra government extended the countrys biggest ever loan waiver package to cover an even greater number of farmers by including all overdue crop loans disbursed since 2009, farmers across the state are reporting their inability to access fresh credit.Amid doubts over conditions imposed for eligibility for the loan waiver, and with the cooperative banking network in deep crisis, farmers have been unable to access any institutional credit more than a fortnight after Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis announced that a fresh line of credit worth Rs 10,000 would be made available immediately to all eligible farmers. And with sowing for the kharif season already at the half-way mark, farmers in regions that have witnessed acute agrarian distress over the past three to four years say the fresh loan of Rs 10,000 may just come too late.Nivrutti Gangurde of Kotamgaon village in Nashiks Niphad taluka had earlier in the year taken a loan of Rs 2 lakh for his daughters wedding. Unable to raise a fresh crop loan as he was unable to clear previous dues, he had to borrow informally from somebody in the village, at higher rates of interest, for the kharif season. I have been overdue since 2014  none of the banks was ready to sanction any loan. In order to meet the operational expenses for my acre of tomato I had to borrow around Rs 2 lakh from a moneylender this year, he says.For Maharashtras farmers now, there is water but no liquidity In Tuljapur talukas Salgara Devti village in Osmanabad district, farmer and postwoman Archana Bhosale says everyone is being turned away from the local bank. Similarly, in Nandurghat village of Beed, local journalist and farmer Amol Jadhav says those visiting the Maharashtra Gramin Bank branch have been told instructions regarding fresh credit havent arrived yet.Across the state, lead bank managers for agricultural loans say the fresh loan of Rs 10,000 promised by the government cannot be extended in the current circumstances where eligibility criteria have been repeatedly tweaked since the announcement and with no master circular from the Reserve Bank of India to all banks on writing off crop loan accounts that are non-performing assets (NPAs) or bad loans.The government and the RBI will have to clearly state which NPAs are to be written off, only then can fresh credit be offered. And banks have seen next to zero recovery ever since the loan waiver demand began to pick up. With nobody making payments on old loans and with no detailed intimation from the government on how to proceed, local banks actually cannot offer fresh loans to anyone, though there are requests every day, says the lead bank manager in one of Marathwadas districts. The Maharashtra Gramin Bank, a regional rural bank, is the only one to have issued a circular to its branches on the loan waiver and fresh credit, but sources say disbursals have remained very low despite demand.The Gramin Bank services 17 districts, including all of Marathwada where the district central cooperative banks are mostly weak or defunct. Chief Manager for Credit and Refinance K D Joshi says a circular was issued as per the directives of the state government to all 408 branches, but concedes that there is confusion regarding eligibility. The criteria are changing daily. Now all loans disbursed since 2009 that are overdue as of June 30, 2016 are eligible, but the government has not issued a circular about this. Until there is a firm eligibility criterion, some confusion will remain, he told The Indian Express.Other bankers say farmers are also a confused lot, some hoping to have multiple loans in multiple banks written off, others simply unaware of the conditions to be fulfilled before the mortgage record can be wiped clean from their 7/12 land extracts. Meanwhile, the distressed district central cooperative banks inability to service customers has added to the slow pace of farmers accessing fresh credit. The Nashik District Central Cooperative Bank (NDCCB) had, by the end of June last year, disbursed over Rs 1,200 crore in crop loans. Once known for its robust financial health, the bank has this year disbursed only Rs 61.41 crore  six per cent of its set target of Rs 1101.05 crore  till now. Chairman Narendra Darade blames the continuing impact of demonetisation for the situation. We do not have cash with us. How are we to disburse money to farmers, he asks.The confusion and consequent glitches in extending fresh credit to farmers eligible for the waiver comes after an already slow crop loan season for Maharashtras banks. By the end of June 2016, of the Rs 37,677.03 crore target for kharif loans, banks had disbursed Rs 20,889.20 crore  a healthy 55 per cent of the target. However, by the middle of June this year, of the targeted Rs 40,547.20 crore, only Rs 9,249.22 crore had been disbursed  barely 23 per cent of the target. On expected lines, district central cooperative banks that disburse around 40 per cent of crop loans have been the worst performers. They have disbursed Rs 5225.94 crore, or 40 per cent of their target of Rs 13108.38 crore. At the end of June 2016, these banks had disbursed Rs 10,451.77 crore of their targeted Rs 13,113.57 crore  80 per cent of the target.Simultaneously, sowing has continued despite the crisis in institutional credit. With healthy water levels in dams and local water bodies, nearly 40 per cent of the kharif sowing is now complete, with over 56 lakh hectares of farm land already sown in anticipation of the promised normal monsoon. At this time last year, only about 13 lakh hectares of farmland had been sown. Villagers say many have turned to private moneylenders in the absence of farm loans from banks. Worse, in some parts of Marathwada, villages actually completed sowing, enthused by the June rainfall, and a dry spell since the end of June has many worried about the likelihood of having to undertake a second sowing, called dubaar perni, a chronic and crippling additional cost for farmers in rainfed and non-irrigated parts.In Dhamangaon village of Ashti taluka, a drought-prone region, for example, a plentiful monsoon in 2016 has ensured theres plenty of water for drinking. But it hasnt rained since the end of June. If it doesnt rain in a week or 10 days, we will have to go in for a second sowing, says deputy sarpanch Dr Syed Bashir. Dhamangaons farmers have sown urad, moong, bajra and cotton and are now concerned about the young crops health at a crucial growth stage.With the weather office predicting a relatively dry July, farmers in Ashti expect they may have to sow a second time. If the promised fresh loans are disbursed now, the money will at least be handy for that, says Dr Syed. If it comes much later, whats the use?Minister of State for Agriculture Sadashiv Khot admitted to receiving complaints about non-disbursal of crop loans from various districts of the state. I will be meeting the chief minister on Friday and ask him to look into the matter. I will also be requesting the district guardian ministers to take weekly meetings with the lead banks and follow up about loan disbursal, he said. Khot signalled that banks who had failed to provide credit on time would face action.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Even as the State got its share of rains, price of the vegetable continues to skyrocket.Sources said, tomato is priced at `70 to `80 a kg in the open market which is almost three times the cost of the vegetable that was being sold at `25 a kg a month ago.The unprecedented price rise has been attributed to supply crunch. While the Capital city requires 100 tonnes of tomato daily, it is now getting half of it. Apart from the locally grown crops, the State depends mostly on Karnataka for the vegetable.According to traders, the red vegetable was priced at `100 a kilo at the Unit-IV market on Thursday. The price, however, came down to `70 on Friday though in some areas it is being sold at `80 a kg.Secretary of Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said the price fluctuation in the market depends on the demand and supply. The supply has been very less from the tomato producing States, he said.Blaming the State Government for the situation, he said, farmers in Keonjhar and Angul region were forced to sell tomatoes at throwaway price during summer. The Government could have purchased the vegetable from the farmers at a reasonable price and stored it for the season. Unfortunately, despite repeated demands, it has failed to set up required number of cold storages, he pointed out.The traders alleged that the retail price is high compared to the wholesale price as the Government has failed to control it. The retail price is 20 to 30 per cent high than the wholesale price, Panda said claiming it should be 5 to 10 per cent depending on the commodity. We are expecting a change in price after the arrival of fresh crop from Maharashtra and Hassan district of Karnataka in next 15 days, he added."

Now, the farmers dont have to worry about middlemen, he said.The consumers in Kerala who had been shelling out high prices fixed by private suppliers for vegetables can now get fresh vegetables with prices prevailing in Agriculture Producers Marketing Committee markets in Mysuru.

In what is being regarded as a consequence of short supply, tomato prices have gone up to ` 75 to 80 per kg.Vegetable vendors at the Gudimalkapur wholesale market say that they have incurred huge losses as there are few takers for the pricey tomatoes and some other vegetables.Jaya, a vendor, says, Due to the excessive rains, a lot of vegetables on the farms have spoiled. We are suffering huge losses. For each carton of 25 kg of tomatoes supplied to us, we are paying `1,500-1,600 at present. Yet, most of the cartons dont hold a quantity beyond 22 kg. Such is the scarcity of vegetables in the market. This price hike has led to considerable reduction in customer footfall in the last three days.It is not only the case of tomato but beans too are being sold at ` 70 a kg in many places. As for green chilli, its wholesale rate is ` 80, says K Vamshi, a frustrated buyer at the mandi.It seems impossible to buy vegetables with this kind of price hike.

Tomato is commonly and widely used and I am now forced to pay ` 75 for it. Has the government any consideration for people? fumes Chandani Adhikari, a tech analyst who lives in Begumpet.Another vegetable vendor, L Padma, has this to say: The unfavourable rains and the mishmash at the vegetable market have completely disturbed the demand-supply balance. A lot of vegetables being supplied to us are not of good quality. Today, out of the one quintal of tomatoes I was supplied, 15 kg were rotten.Ravindar Kumar, secretary of Agricultural Market Committee, Gudimalkapur, explains, A lot of vegetables are spoiled because of the unfavourable rains. This happens in the month on June every year but the sale has come down this year. If the situation continues to remain like this, the vegetable market is likely to see a further dip of 10 to 30 per cent in sales.But monsoon is favourable for some vegetables. The rains, on the other hand, have helped in the cultivation of some vegetables. For example, most of the farmers in Nalgonda district have started cultivating dondakaya as the weather is just appropriate for its cultivation, observes Kumar.Sale prices exceed those fixed by AMCA contrast was seen between the prices at which several vegetables are being sold in the market against their retail prices fixed by the Agricultural Market Committee, Gudimalkapur. Tomato is being sold at I80/kg against the fixed price of I54/kg, cauliflower at I70/kg against I32, French beans at I70/kg against I42/kg and green chilli at I80/kg against I62/kg."

If the daily expense for vegetables was Rs 150 earlier, it has gone up to Rs 250 now. This is affecting the family budget.According to consumers, the price hike of tomato, green chillies and drumstick has left them in a lurch as these items are essential for many dishes. I dont think the soaring price of vegetables will have an impact on upper-class families. But it will be a herculean task for middle-class families to make ends meet, said Thanusha, an ophthalmologist working in a private hospital.However, many feel there is no considerable hike in the prices of veggies post GST.

Yet, they are charging an unfair price. We cant understand the reason for such a huge difference as Cumbum is only 23 km away from Kumily.The biggest difference is in the price of cucumber.

But due to incessant rain in that state, movement of vehicles has been affected in last one month.

He carefully feeds the old destitute woman who cannot even sit up.T Periyasamy and his friends have been doing this without missing a single day for nearly six years. Wednesday was the 292nd week of feeding destitute on roads. What began as a rare human compassion has now become an obsession for Periyasamy and 30 volunteers of Amudhasurabi project.The project offers full meals with water packets every afternoon to 100 persons in Salem City and to 500 persons on Sundays for destitute in the city and rural areas. Periyasamy runs an electrical shop near the old bus stand while the volunteers are from various walks of life. But none, including Periyasamy, is well off financially but seem to have a rare resolve to help the most helpless.Thirty per cent of the cost is supported by non-volunteers while the rest is pooled by the volunteers. They have set up a dedicated kitchen at Seelanaickenpatti. A paid cook prepares the food every Sunday. The volunteers gather at the kitchen on Sunday at 5.30 am and share the work like cleaning, vegetable cutting and food packing.At 11.30 am they leave to give the food to the hungry. On week days food is out-sourced for cash from a reliable source. We ensure that the lunch reaches the people by 1.30 pm every day. We have not missed even a day till date since we started. Most of whom we serve have been deserted by family. We look for people who cant even take a step to receive the lunch packet.In many cases they cannot even eat on their own and volunteers have to feed them literally, not just give the food packet and move on to the next.Water packets were added to the lunch offer when one day I saw an old woman who gets food regularly from us crawled up to the nearby drainage to wash hands and shockingly she also drank the drain water, he says.Recounting the journey, Periyasamy said that initially he visited old age and destitute homes run by NGOs and charitable trusts to offer some help. But he found that help was never scarce for such institutions. But those are on the roads sides and pavements had none to help.First I started giving idlis to 20 persons. But I found many were keeping it for more than a day till it rot. Later I tried giving lime and tomato rice which too ended same way. We brain stormed and came with the idea of providing full meal lunch. This was well received and we saw people eating it instantly. Soon we noticed people waiting anxiously for us to come. That really motivated me to take the full plunge."

He said the prices are expected to come down a bit from today.Sreenivasan said, the reason for the steep prices was, ironically, its once-upon-a-time low price. He said, Six months ago, farmers didnt maintain the crop well because the price was low. At one point, the price had become as low as Rs 5-6 per kilo. Also, the number of tomato growers is usually very less during summers.He added that farmers have a herd mentality, wherein if one farmer does something, the rest would tend to follow suit. These factors have created a shortage in the market, which has driven up the price, he opined.By next month the prices should be back to normal, he added.When asked if the lack of rainfall was a factor, he denied it. He said it was in fact heavy rainfall which spoiled the tomato crop, resulting in price hike.Prices of a few other commodities have also increased. Banana of the yelakki variety is sold for Rs 83 at Hopcoms outlets, while the cost of various varieties of grapes ranges from Rs 39-75."

Farmers are unable to reap the benefits and consumers are feeling the pinch.As farmers cant sit for an entire day in the market to sell their produce, they sell the harvest in wholesale market at a price demanded by the middlemen.Middlemen get a maximum of 70% and minimum of 50% profit for the tomatoes brought by farmers. Seeing the demand for tomatoes, middlemen and retailers have hiked the prices. Few farmers said middlemen decide the price to a large extent.We toil in fields but the profits are taken away by others. As tomatoes cant be kept for more than three days, we have to sell it at the best available price, said a farmer in Dharwad.We sell a basket of 8kg tomatoes for about `350-`450. We also have to pay for transportation and labour charges. But in the retail market, the same tomato is being sold at `100 per kg. We sell tomatoes to middlemen as they take the entire quantity at one go, he added.Horticulture Department deputy director S B Diddimani said, Vegetable prices go up every year. But this year, the prices have gone too high. They may come down and get stabilised in another 15 days.Scarcity of rain and decrease in sowing areas are the reasons for price hike. Once tomatoes from districts like Belagavi and Kolar start arriving in the city market, the burden of price hike will be eased, he added.The middlemen at the APMC yard say they are blamed whenever the prices go up. Many retailers buy produce on credit. We pay labour charges to distribute the vegetables. We hardly get `50 to `60 profit a basket, they said.Potato farmers in Hassan a worried lotHassan: Potato farmers in Hassan are a worried lot as they incurred crop loss consecutively for five years.

The ruling side hit back, saying the present miserable condition of the farmers was due to the Congress partys rule of 60 years.The BJP members said it was the Modi government which had initiated a slew of programmes for the welfare of farmers over the last three years.Initiating the discussion on the farmers distress leading to rise in the incidents of thier suicide, Digvijay Singh (Cong) accused the government of being insensitive to plight of the agriculturists.He referred to the police firing on a violent agitation by farmers in Madhya Pradesh recently and said the agriculturists faced bullets on the centenary of Champaran agitation in which Mahatma Gandhi had raised his voice against British exploitation.He termed the imposition of import-export duties on foodgrains as one of the biggest scams.He said despite the bumper crop, import duty on wheat was reduced initially to 10 per cent from 25 per cent and then to zero in December, impacting farmers adversely as imported wheat was avaiable at cheaper prices.Foodgrain imports, which stood at Rs 134 crore in 2014-15, have risen to Rs 9,009 crore now, he said.Singh alleged that it was the wrong import-export policies which had led to imports of Rs 1,40,268 crore in 2015-16 as against Rs 56,000 crore in 2011-12.Quoting agriculture scientist MS Swaminathan to say that import of agricultural commodities was like outsourcing farmers skill to outside, he said there was a need for fixing import-export levies by the Commerce Ministry in consultation with Agriculture Ministry.Expressing concern over 42 per cent rise in incidents of suicide in 2014-15 in the country, Singh said agriculture has been reduced to loss-making proposition despite it contributing about 17 per cent to the GDP.He also alleged that there was corruption in Food Corporation of India (FCI) and National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED).The Congress leader alleged that after demonetisation, it was restrictions on cattle sale that had hit the farmers.He quoted Savarkar as saying that he was against ban on cow slaughter.Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Singh said that others in the Cabinet were helpless as it was PM who decided everything.He alleged that the crop insurance policy was nothing but a way to benefit industrialists.Minister of State for Agriculture Parshottam Rupala, who spoke in the capacity of a BJP member, said it was the Congress partys rule of 60 years which had resulted in the miserable condition of the farmers.There should be a discussion on the policies of previous governments and what all they did for farm sector, he said.He said the Modi government had taken a number of steps for the betterment of the farmers.Listing out the schemes, he said Rs 50,000 crore has been allocated for PM Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY) and 22 schemes under the project have already seen the light of the day.Under the programme, plans for irrigation at district level have been formulated, Rupala said.Ram Gopal Yadav of Samajwadi Party said the farmers have been affected because of import of agri products, which he alleged was being allowed because of ulterior motives while farmers are being deprived of remunerative prices.The prices of many agri-items have fallen below the minium support prices and, in some crops, it is not enough to meet even the transportation cost, he said.Citing the example of tomato prices that have risen sharply to about Rs 100 per kg, he said the prices are low when crops are harvested, but these rise after farmers sell their produce in the market.He said the futures market was also responsible for the farmers plight.Yadav said the agri growth has largely been below 4 per cent in last 25-30 years and that the farmers economic condition would not improve unless there is a sustainable growth in the sector.Yadav said the government has put tractors and pump sets in higher tax rate under the new GST regime and demanded that these items should be exempted from GST.Food processing in the country is in such a bad shape that every year fruits and vegetables worth Rs 50,000 crore to Rs 60,000 crore rot in the country, he said.Food processing percentage in India is barely 4 per cent as compared to 80 per cent in nations like Brazil, he added.He wanted to know under what circumstances private companies were roped in crop insurance scheme which was handled by the government companies earlier.He also wondered as to why the government could not use technology so that Indian apples could also last more unlike those imported from the US.Prasanna Acharya (BJD) sought to know from the government why farmers are committing suicide and are protesting on streets if the agriculture growth was high.He said farmers are not getting returns for their produce and are being cheated, not by Monsoon but by the government. Demonetisation has further aggravated their woes, he added.While the new crop insurance policy is better than the previous ones, it is benefitting private insurers more, he said.He said the Centre and states should take steps to fulfill three main demands of farmers  price, pension and prestige.Munquad Ali (BSP) said farmers situation is very bad in the country and that there has been a rise in farmers suicides in the last three years.Why it is happening? Why the government is not finding solution farmers problems? .I request the government not to give false promises. Please work for the welfare of farmers, he said.Praful Patel of NCP pitched for modern farm technologies like genetically modified crops to boost farm income,.It is unfortunate. I am sorry to say that we have neglected science and technology. There may be different views on BT technology but we have data how it benefits. We need to take benefit of it, he said.Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh has always focused on indigenous (technologies) but there is a need to use modern technology to improve farmers income, he said and suggested the minister to keep open mind on the issue of technology.Patel also spoke about shortcomings in the new crop insurance scheme and suggested the government to keep a watch on private insurers who are implementing it.Vijaysai Reddy (YSRCP) said the government needs to introspect why 12,000 farmers are committing suicides every year despite the government coming out with new schemes.He demanded that the loan waiver announced in some states need to be implemented in letter and spirite, claims under new crop insurance scheme should be settled in 15 days, better credit facility and creation of special agri-zones for farmers for better realisation.R S Bharathi (DMK) attacked the Prime Minister for not meeting the protesting Tamil Nadu farmers in Delhi and demanded a special session of Parliament to discuss the farmers issue and a special law to address their woes.Rajani Patil (Cong) said, I dont think the number (of farmers suicides will come down if the government does not take steps.She attacked Modi for not visiting affected farmers in Maharashtra, saying the prime minister has time to travel around the globe but no time for farmers in the state.Turning to Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh, she said the farmers situation is very serious. We dont want to hear about schemes in your reply. Tell me what relief you can give to our farmers. We want full loan waiver.Prabhat Jha (BJP) rejected allegation that the government was insensitive towards farmers plight and said maximum decisions had been taken over the last three years in the interest of farmers.He listed a slew of measures underaken like raising minimum support price for agriculture produce like wheat, rice, pulses and oilseeds.He said it was due to initiatives of the government that there was a record production of foodgrains in the country in 2016-17 at 271.98 million tonne (MT) including 108.8 MT rice and 96.64 MT of wheat besides 22.14 MT of pulses and 33.60 MT of oilseeds.On police firing during farmers agitation in Madhya Pradesh recently, Jha asked the opposition not to link such incidents to politics.He reminded the Congress that 24 farmers had been killed in firing in Madhya Pradesh in 1998 when Digvijay Singh was the Chief Minister and said nobody linked it to politics.D Raja of CPI said the whole country is witnessing suffering of farmers and asked the central government to consider debt waiver which has been done by various states.Farmers committing suicides should be unacceptable to us, Raja said and questioned why various commission reports on agriculture were not being implemented by the government.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

In addition, the NGO claimed, ghee, coconut, cashew and raisins were of poor quality.The NGO sampled 1,143 food items in the May-June period, and found 983 samples adulterated. Whats worse salt used for preparing food didnt contain iodine, said an NGO official.The findings found an overall adulteration of 86% of the total samples collected for tests. Eighty-one percent of salt samples did not have iodine. Mustard oil and vermillion were found adulterated. Some common items used to cook noodles such as chilli sauce, tomato sauce and vinegar were found unfit for consumption.Not only food, even prasad offered to the deities is of poor quality. Consumption of the food served to the people on yatra could mean a serious threat to life. Salt, an important ingredient was, found without iodine...which is dangerous, SPECS secretary Brijmohan Sharma said at a conference after releasing the findings on Wednesday.In the first 10 days, 2.21 lakh pilgrims paid obeisance at Badrinath and Kedarnath. Some 15 lakh pilgrims visited the four shrines within two months after the pilgrimage season began on April 27.Food Safety and Standards Authority (FSSA) additional commissioner Pankaj Pandey rejected the findings of the NGO. If the findings are genuine, then why dont they share statistics with the government? We dont claim that there is no adulteration along the route, but the report is exaggerated, he told Hindustan Times.Secretary, tourism, R Meenakshi Sundaram came out in support of Pandey. I cant say whether the report is correct or not, but it brings a bad name to the state. If the NGO is so concerned of adulteration, then why doesnt it reach out to the authority?Sharma was clueless whether the report was to be shared with FSSA officials. He told Hindustan Times that the previous reports were submitted to former chief minister Harish Rawat, who forwarded the findings to the department concerned. Its difficult to meet secretaries and, therefore, we forward our reports to the chief minister."
5a0732b49855b76bf13c88f0,First time  tomato turns gold in Madanapalle market,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/first-time-tomato-turns-gold-in-madanapalle-market/article19213706.ece,2017-07-05,"For the first time in recent decades, the tomato price in the Madanapalle market, the largest in the drought-prone Rayalaseema region, stood at Rs. 60 per kg, giving moments of joy to the farmers. The price is expected to further go up in the next couple of weeks, even touching Rs. 100 in the open market.During the last one week, the arrivals to the market remained fluctuating, but tending to be on the downward side. On Tuesday, the market received stocks to the tune of 293 metric tonnes, while it was 317 MT on Monday. In July 2016, the arrival was registered at 600 tonnes per day.Now, half of the produce with first quality grade was exported to Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and New Delhi. The second variety was sold in the wholesale at Rs. 41 per kg, which in turn was priced at Rs. 60-80 in the regular vegetable markets. The price is expected to go up in the next couple of weeks, even touching Rs. 100 in the open market.Farmers at the Madanapalle market had thrown away the produce in hundreds of tonnes daily when the price suddenly fell to Rs. 1 per kg in June 2015. Two years since the event, they have reason to smile. About 10,000 farmers depend on tomato crop in the western mandals, covering an acreage of about 30,000 hectares.Deputy Director (Horticulture) Saraswathi told The Hindu that in February harvesting of the major part of the crop was done and there was a slump in the later months.The crop suffered substantial damage in April and May due to sudden rains in the western mandals. Though tomato farming is done in Madanapalle division throughout the year, this year, there prevailed a gap between February and June, the official said. Agriculture Market Committee (AMC-Madanapalle) chairman Ratakonda Gurappa Naidu, an authority on tomato trading in the region since three decades, said for the first time the farmers were educated about the need for sustained farming, covering round the year. In the previous seasons, a farmer used to go in for tomato crop all over the field simultaneously. This used to result in bumper crop, resulting in no demand and plummeting prices. This crop year, the farmers divided the crop pattern into three categories.Each farmer maintained three slots of farming, avoiding bumper crops. The even distribution has led to a drastic fall in production, but it protected the economic interests of the farmers with healthy demand and moderate supply.Another reason for happiness of the domestic farmer here is that tomato growing has been halted in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh with the advent of summer, facilitating our farmers to export their produce to northern parts, Mr. Naidu said.Meanwhile, the retail prices at the vegetable markets became a cause of big worry to the households. In Chittoor, the second quality produce was sold at Rs. 70-80 on Tuesday, and it was the same throughout the district. In Srikalahasti, the supply was truncated, and the households virtually went hunting for the red gold."

The firm will not be billing the BBMP for this project.While the menu has been finalised, Mr. Bhan told The Hindu that they are now working on the recipes and standard operating procedures.

A week before, tomatoes were priced at Rs. 36 and chillies at Rs. 26 a kg.Attributing the surge in prices of vegetables to unfavourable climatic condition and frequent showers, farmers say the annual harvest has been adversely affected. This year, rain washed away most part of tomato crop cultivated on a two-acre field in my farm in Sabbavaram mandal. Normally, the seasonal crop fetches good margins but this time I have to grapple with the failed harvest, rues P. Appala Naidu, tomato-grower.While tomato producers from Ramabhadrapuram, Sabbavaram, K. Kotapadu and Pendurthi mandals bear the brunt of the crop failure, wholesale traders cite short supply from vegetable-growing regions as reason for increase in tomato price. The supply from main tomato-growing regions such as Kolar, Narayangaon, Bengaluru, Guntur, Anantapur and Madanapalle has come down drastically. With a huge variation between the demand and supply, the prices of tomatoes have eventually increased, A. Narayana Murthy, wholesale trader, says.Rythu bazaars in MVP Colony, Seethammadhara and Gopalapatnam receive about 50 to 80 quintals of tomatoes a day, whereas the ones at Narasimha Nagar, Kancharapalem, Peda Waltair and Madhurawada get 20-40 quintals.In addition to tomatoes and green chillies, prices of leafy vegetables have almost doubled in the past 10 days. A small bunch of coriander leaves costs Rs. .10-Rs. 20.According to estate officer of MVP Rythu Bazaar K. Varahalu, the cost of tomatoes and green chillies will continue to remain high for the next few days."

A scene from the Ernakulam market on Tuesday.Thulasi KakkatThere seems to be no respite to the common man as vegetable prices in the district continue to remain largely high, with tomato, onion and carrot being especially costly.At the Ernakulam market, small onion was sold at a wholesale price of Rs. 90 per kg and a retail price of Rs. 100 whereas tomato and carrot were sold at Rs. 52 and Rs. 60 and Rs. 55 and Rs. 60 respectively. Prices were even higher in some other markets.On an average, vegetable prices continue to be 20 per higher than what it was a month ago, though prices of some vegetables have dropped slightly, said K.K. Ashraf, vice-president, Ernakulam Market Stall Owners Association.Price of shallotsThe only relief seems to be the declining trend in the price of shallots after touching a high of Rs. 130 recently, though the ruling retail price of Rs. 100 per kg is a far cry from Rs. 65 in April. Mr. Ashraf expressed the hope that a further softening of onion prices would come about with production catching up in Tamil Nadu, the main supplier to Kerala.However, tomato and carrot prices continued to hold firm with the previous low of Rs. 20 per kg appearing to be from a distant past. Green chilli has also turned a lot spicier with the price soaring to Rs. 60 per kg from Rs. 35.The shortage of tomatoes in North India drove traders from there to the markets in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which in turn, took a toll on the supply to Kerala. The strike by farmers in Maharashtra didnt help either, Mr. Ashraf said.In the meantime, the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) which aims at ensuring fair prices for farmers, was on a high over what it claimed consistently good returns for farmers. Farmers continue to auction their crops through 22 farmer markets in the district.Data collected from the wholesale markets in Aluva, Ernakulam and Perumbavoor on a daily basis by the market information centre of the VFPRCK were handed over to farmers to be used as the base price in auctioning their produce.This ensured that farmers got a price, which was even better than the market price, a senior VFPCK official said.Asked whether better price for farmers automatically resulted in higher prices for consumers, the official said that it was beyond the mandate of the VFPCK and had to be addressed by the government through market intervention measures."

Farmers in Madhya Pradeshs Neemuch-Mandsaur belt are feeling cheated as well. Just two months ago they were facing police bullets for demanding better prices for their bumper crop of onions, which they had to dump by the truckloads on the streets.In January-February, the same region had seen protests over a tomato glut, with prices crashing to as low as Rs 2 per kg. The subsequent onion bumper crop dragged its price to Rs 2 a kilogram, forcing many farmers to let their produce rot in the fields.We have noticed that whenever farmers have perishable items with them, the prices are in the dumps, and the moment it goes into the hands of traders, there is a massive price spike, says Bhupendra Patidar, a farmer from Barbariya village in Neemuch district.Six farmers were killed in clashes with police in the Neemuch-Mandsaur region in the first week of June, leading to protests across the state and a demand for government assured minimum price at local markets. The protests forced the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government to procure onions at Rs 8 per kg.Two months down the line, when the farmers have nothing to sell and are busy sowing for the next season, the prices of most agriculture products have shot up.In May, the average price of tomatoes in Mandsaurs wholesale market was Rs 500-700 per quintal. In August first week, it touched Rs 4,500. Similarly, the price of onions almost doubled from Rs 400 to Rs 800 per quintal during the same period.Skyrocketing prices Average price of onion and tomato has been witnessing a sharp spike across the country over past few months Average price of onion and tomato has been witnessing a sharp spike across the country over past few monthsWith local traders adding their profit margin, tomatoes are retailing at Rs 100 or more per kg in most parts of the country. The retail price of onion has crossed Rs 30 per kg, with a further spike expected till the fresh produce lands in September.Small and marginal farmers who constitute 85% of the farming community rarely get the benefit of high prices. The reason being they dont have storage facilities to take benefit of the price fluctuation, says Patidar, who witnessed the dumping of unsold onions and tomatoes by the roadside this year.After last years losses, like most farmers, we did not grow tomatoes this season. But now the prices are sky high and only the traders have it, says Jaswant Carpenter of Pipliyamandi, the epicentre of the farmers protest in Mandsaur.Traders, however, blame low production for tomato prices sky-rocketing.There is less production this year and therefore low supply. Most of it is in the hands of the big traders who are releasing it slowly from the cold storage so that the prices do not come down, says a government official in Indore, not wanting to be named.Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh president Shiv Kumar Sharma blames the government for the price fluctuations. In the last 14 years, the government has failed to increase storage capacity for onions or tomatoes as a result of which vegetables rot during bumper production and only traders benefit by hoarding it.Given the current spate of rains and floods, traders see no relief in sight due to supply disruption which is likely to continue till August-end. In fact, prices of other vegetables such as brinjal and cabbage will also rise due to reduced supply as the summer vegetable season comes to an end.(With inputs from Mustafa Hussain)"

The price has skyrocketed compared to last week, making it one of the costliest vegetables this week.According to traders, the steep rise in the price is due to decline in supply to the market in the city. The increase in price of this staple vegetable is making purchase of vegetables an expensive exercise.As A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam, explained, There is no production of tomatoes in Tamil Nadu as of now, and we are relying only on supply from Andhra Pradesh. As tomatoes are being supplied from AP to all places, the supply is dwindling, resulting in the rise in rates.On Tuesday, a kg of tomato was priced between Rs. Rs. 50 and Rs. 60 in the retail market, but each shop fixed its own rate. The price has been steadily rising in the last 10 days by Rs. five to Rs. 10. Last week, the price of one kg of tomato was between Rs. 30 and Rs. 40, he said.Last month, tomatoes were sold at Rs. 15 to Rs. 20 a kg, he added. A retail vendor in Sathuvachari said the rates had shot up especially in the last three or four days. A box of tomatoes comprising 25 kg was earlier priced at Rs. 600. Now, it costs between Rs. 1,300 and Rs. 1,400.Brinjal too is costlyAnother vegetable that has turned pricier is the thorny variety of brinjal. The rates have almost doubled when compared to a few weeks ago. A kilogram of brinjal costs between Rs. 60 and Rs. 80 now. There is no water for crops, and there is also pest attack due to heat conditions. Hence, the yield is less, Mr. Balu added."

There is no definite cause for the increase, with middlemen at Vashi APMC blaming ambiguous causesfrom November's demonetisation to the farmers' strike in June as well as ""inclement weather"".Contrary to traders' claims there is no visible shortage either. Good quality, robust red tomatoes are available at all markets in Mumbai. Curiously, retail rates are rising even as wholesale rates continue to fall.APMC trader Shyam Yadav said, ""Wholesale rates rose to Rs 55-60 per kg over Friday-Saturday. On Monday, they dropped to Rs 36-40. Let us see what happens tomorrow.""Conversely, retail rates were Rs 35-40 per kg over Friday-Saturday, perhaps due to leftover stocks, which spiralled to Rs 60-80 Monday as retailers charged their pound of flesh. ""I bought half a kilo for Rs 30 to tide over the next two days. But how long can we continue like this?"" said Andheri resident Shaila Grover.Tomato is a household staple without which no meal is complete. Moreover, Shravan observances are set to begin on July 10 for north Indian communities and July 24 for Maharashtrians and Gujaratis. During this time families avoid onion and garlic and rely on tomato.One of the largest middlemen in the tomato trade at APMC Vashi, Javed Memon, cited a slew of reasons which seemed tough to swallow. ""This price increase is an outcome of notebandi. Recently there was also the farmers' strike in Maharashtra. Moreover, I am told the seeds have failed in south India. So this season we are relying on tomatoes from Maharashtra where a heat wave has beset certain growing areas. Also, remember that farmers have not been getting a good rate for their produce since the past year and a half. It is time they made some money.""Asked when customers would get relief, Memon said, ""Don't think of customers. Why think of customers alone, think of the farmer as well."" TOI asked if farmers were getting good rates at present. ""Well, not to their satisfaction. After all, the quality of their tomatoes is poor,"" the middleman said, adding prices would remain high till end-August.Mumbai receives its quota of tomato from cultivated areas in Karnataka, as well as Satara, Sangli and Narayangaon in Pune."

Traders attribute it to shortage of supply within the state due to excess rain, coinciding with cut down in regular supply by other states.In the retail market, the price of the bell-weather vegetable  tomato  has increased from Rs 20-30/kg to Rs 80/kg. Prices of almost all fresh vegetables, barring onion and potato, have increased by over 100%.Sameer Singh, a software profession, was surprised when confronted by the hike in vegetable prices. ""I had last purchased vegetables last Sunday (June 25), when prices were stable. But today, I was taken aback by vegetable prices, which have shot up by over 100%. In particular, prices of tomatoes, cucumbers and coriander have skyrocketed,"" said Singh, resident of Sector 15, adding he hopes prices will settle down in a few weeks.Amrita Yadav, a resident of Sector 10A, has cut down on her family's vegetable consumption in the wake of the price rise. ""We were eating lots of salad for the past few months. But with prices of cucumber, tomato and coriander rising significantly, we had to remove salad from our menu,"" said homemaker Yadav.According to traders, prices rose mainly due to contraction in supply of vegetables after the rains. Inderjeet Thakran, president of Khandsa Market Association, said, ""Supply has reduced by 40% in a week, leading to increase in prices.""""Across north India, most agricultural fields are submerged,"" said Thakran, adding prices rise every year after rains, and are expected to settle down in 2-3 weeks. ""Prices are expected to fall by this month-end. You will see correction in prices of some of the vegetables later this week itself,"" he said.He added that tomato, which had remained relatively cheap so far due to local supply, will remain costly for some time, even as prices of other vegetables come down.""Local tomato supply has ended. Currently, we're getting tomatoes from Himachal Pradesh, and supply is low. But, this happens during monsoons every year"" said Thakran, adding that from next month, tomatoes from Bengaluru and Nasik will arrive to bring down price."

Legend has it that the craft was patronized by Tipu Sultan during times of drought to help the people of Channapatna earn a living. He brought a family of artisans from Persia to make wooden columns and later wooden toys to ornate the columns.Later, when the famous Mysore doll industry started dwindling, all the dolls for Dasara were made in Channapatna, and that's how the tradition lived. The craft flourished and hit its peak in the 70s and 80s when wooden napkin rings were exported in huge numbers.""This was Channapatna's golden period. But soon demand for flat toned finish picked up, affecting the traditional lacquering of tonal gradation. This continued for a good 10 to 12 years. Then buyers found cheaper places such as China and other Asian nations for these products,"" says Atul Johri.""Although a few groups and individuals continued to make the traditional wooden wares but the craft started losing its sheen as the tonal gradation techniques were lost owing to mass production in order to compete with the Chinese replicas, and lack of skilled artisans. This also led to people leaving Channapatna for odd jobs in Bengaluru,"" he adds.""The replicas first land in Mysuru and then come to Channapatna, and sold along with the toys made here. The government has barely done anything to check this influx.The replicas were so cheap that the units and artisans in Channapatna couldn't sustain the competition and many started selling the cheap foreign imita tions, which was more profitable,"" says Ali Khan, a fourth genera tion craftsman.The government con ducts training workshops but they haven't been of much help to the artisans in Chan napatna.With no focus on the market dynamics for domestic and global consumption, these trainings are of little benefit. And, after the workshops, the artisans are left with no work and end up doing odd jobs.The training kits distributed by the government includes impact drill and handsaw among other things.""These are useless for artisans.The kits were received by all and sundry. A tomato seller who got the kit sold it to me for Rs 2000,"" says Yusuf Ali Khan whose family has been living in Channapatna for the past 50 years.

Tomato, in fact, is sold at Rs 80 per kg by neighbourhood retailers.Green chillies, capsicum, beans and cauliflower have also become dearer. Retailers are selling for nothing less than 10% commission, a source in the business said.While vegetable merchants and traders' associations blame excessive rainfall destroying production for the sudden rise in the prices of vegetables, others point to the ongoing marriage season among Muslims.""Apart from excessive rainfall destroying produce this year, the marriage season among Muslims, following Ramzan, has also contributed to the rise in prices of some vegetables -- mostly tomato and green vegetables,"" said Choudhury Mohammed Idrees , general secretary of Russell Market Traders' Association.Stakeholders admit that farmers' lack of interest in growing veggies for the local market and focus on exports instead, has also squeezed supply, according to officials from Hopcoms and the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Yard, Yeshwantpur.""For nine months now, tomatoes and several green vegetables were available dirt-cheap, sometimes for as low as Rs 7 per kg. This affected farmers' profits and they lost interest in growing these veggies for some time, disrupting the steady supply of adequate veggies to the market,"" Ravi Krishna , managing director at Hopcoms, said.""Huge stocks of tomato, capsicum, beans and other green vegetables have been extensively diverted for exports this year; hence, there is less production for the local market. This has also contributed to a sudden increase in price,"" added Loknath H, a staffer at APMC Yard, Yeshwantpur.However, city vegetable traders are confident that in a month's time, the crisis would be resolved and rates would return to normal.Goods and Services Tax (GST), however, had no impact on the price of vegetables, said merchants. ""GST has got nothing to do with the rise or drop in price of vegetables as all perishable goods, like vegetables and fruits, have been kept out of the GST bracket,"" Idrees said.BEARING THE BRUNTWith the implementation of GST, food has become costlier in eateries as well as online delivery sites.

The Centre has decided to construct 500 cold storage chains across India.Union minister of agriculture Radha Mohan Singh, who was in Gandhinagar to attend the Textile India-2017 exhibition told TOI that these cold storage chains would be useful in helping farmers get better price for the produce and thereby increase their income.Regarding Gujarat farmers demanding a minimum support price for potato, tomato and onions, Singh said that the country already has a list of crops for which minimum support price has been announced. ""But currently there is no plan to upgrade the list or include vegetables in this list,"" Singh said.When told that farmers in Gujarat were throwing their produce away because of low support prices, Singh said that they should use cold storage facilities.Speaking at the seminar on 'Productivity and Product Diversification Challenges for Natural Fibres,' Singh said that natural fibres are the backbone of Indian textile industry. He said that despite stiff competition from synthetic fibres, the demand for natural fibres was steadily increasing with a growing population.The minister further said that given the limitation in increasing area under cultivation, the only way to improve production is increasing productivity. He said that introduction of high-yielding varieties, best agronomical practices, efficient fibre extractors and effective utilization for diversified products will improve productivity. Cotton is produced in over 90 countries across the world, and over 60% of that production comes from India, Singh said.Union textile minister Smriti Irani said the textile ministry and agriculture ministry have decided that the two ministries will have a regular exchange of information, knowledge and feedback on best practices . She said textiles is one of India's leading industries and has the potential to generate employment for millions of people throughout the country. The knowledge sharing will be in local languages so that farmers get the information and are not left out because the information was not a language they did not understand."

While retailers do not link the increase with GST, they feel an apprehension of overall increase in prices in the new tax regime has prompted middlemen to jack up prices. They have also cited less buying by retailers during rainy season as another reason for supply shortage in local markets.In retail markets , increase in average prices is ranging between Rs 10 and Rs 15 per kg. So far, the worst hit has been tomato which has seen a decline in supply and a sharp rise in prices. During the past fortnight, tomato price has increased by around Rs 15 per kg. ""We sold tomato at Rs 40-45 per kg even two weeks back. Now it is being sold at Rs 60 per kg. We are told that there has been a dip in supply of the Bengaluru crop,"" said Gopal Kundu, a vegetable retailer at Lake Market. Tomato prices have actually shown a sharp rise across the country in the past 10 days following crop damage due to rain in tomato-producing states like Haryana.""We receive the bulk of tomato from Maharashtra. But supplies have gone down substantially in the past few weeks. This has created a supply shortage in the wholesale market. As a result, prices of tomato has almost doubled in the past week,"" said Uttam Mukherjee, chief supervisor of Koley market.Other vegetables, including striped gourd (parwal), ladies finger (bhindi), brinjal and onion, have also recorded increase in prices at city markets. ""At Maniktala market, prices of vegetables like striped gourd, ladies finger and brinjal have increased by around Rs 10 per kg in past two weeks. So far, there has not been any report of crop damage from rain in neighbouring districts. But, price is still rising,"" said Kartik Saha, a vegetable vendor at Maniktala market.""Government has said there won't be any impact of GST on vegetables. But we have seen a steady rise in prices in past two weeks, especially after the Eid. It seems the middlemen are taking advantage of fears over the new tax regime,"" Kundu said."

The prices began skyrocketing in June after a drop in the stocks arrival to the market.The wholesale price for the local variety was Rs. 47 a kg at the APMC Market in Mysuru on Friday. The price in the retail market was between Rs. 55 and Rs. 60 per kg. Top quality fruit had been fetching Rs. 5 more a kg.Basavaraju, a farmer from Kalkunda in T. Narsipur taluk, is a happy man as he sold the hybrid variety at Rs. 1,050 a crate. His 22 crates of tomato (each containing over 10 kg) were bought at an auction at one go. Basavarajus produce was bought by a trader from Kerala. He described the price as highest in this season.Basavaraju attributed the sudden rise in the cost caused by a fall in production to declining water reserves (short-duration crops not getting sufficient water) and the demand for the fruit in neighbouring States, mainly from Kerala and Tamil Nadu.Basavaraju, who had grown tomatoes on a small portion of his land at Kalkunda, had so far harvested 200 crates and expects 50 more crates in the next few days. I go to markets where I get a good price. I have also sold tomato in Bengaluru and Hassan markets, said the farmer, who also grows vegetables on his 7-acre plot.Like Basavaraju, tomato growers, who had brought their produce to the APMC here, said they had grown the fruit with borewell water. The three-month crop needs water intermittently and the groundwater source had not improved with rains playing truant, they said.Stability unlikelyUntil May, tomato was available at Rs. 15-Rs. 20 a kg. The sharp rise in the price had upset the common people. I have minimised using tomatoes in cooking with the rise in price. I now buy a quarter kg instead of a kg to offset the hike, says Geetha, a homemaker.Tomato prices may remain unchanged or rise further till August as fresh produce was likely to arrive on a big scale by then.

A retail grocery trader at Cantonment in Tiruchi was selling a kilo of tomato at Rs. 100 on Thursday.However, wholesale traders at Gandhi Market quote Rs. 60 for one kg of tomato and it was Rs. 10 higher in Gandhi Markets retail shops. The rate was the same at the Uzhavar Sandhai in Thennur.The price of one box (25 kg) of tomato hovered between Rs. 1,400 and Rs. 1,600 at Gandhi Market, traders said. Out of a 25 kg box, 2 kg would have rotten during the transportation period. Traders will have to make profit with the remaining 23 kg of tomato, said an official of Uzhavar Sandhai.Since the price was high, customers shied away from buying tomatoes. Though tomato is an important commodity for cooking, not many customers prefer to buy one kg of tomato at Rs. 100. They manage the situation by limiting their purchase to 200-300 grams, said G. Manikandan, a retail grocery trader at Cantonment.Traders attribute the high price to the dwindling arrival from Andhra Pradesh, Krishnagiri, Theni and Oddanchathiram.

According to an official, traders from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are purchasing the product in Karnataka.In May, tomato cultivators in Kolar were dumping their crop by the roadside as prices had crashed to as low as Rs. 2 a kg in the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) yard. This month, however, the tide has turned. Rates have doubled and, in some cases, increased four times since June. Kolar district is one of the biggest producers of tomato in Karnataka.The reason for this change in narrative is a massive loss of the crop in some of the major tomato growing States in the country.Huge damage to crops, particularly in Nashik in Maharashtra, is the main reason for increase in demand from Kolar. Plus, damage to crop due to diseases and pests in non-traditional areas such as Mandya has added to the scarcity, said M.S. Raju, Deputy Director, Horticulture Department.According to A. Vishwanath, an APMC official, traders from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are purchasing the product in Karnataka. Another APMC source said that there has been interest even from Punjab. On June 4, a quintal was being sold at the APMC for a minimum of Rs. 314 and a maximum of Rs. 1,400 depending on quality and variety. On July 4, the price range was from Rs. 667 to Rs. 5,334 a quintal. On Wednesday morning, the average rate was around Rs. 5,000.In the retail market, consumers were paying Rs. 10 per kg a month ago. Now, they have to shell out as much as Rs. 50.Search for alternativesA reduction in supply from other States and districts combined with the produce from Kolar being shipped out of Karnataka has led to a scarcity and a steep hike in prices in the local market.This has led to experimenting with other local products.

Fall in production in neighbouring States owing to climatic factors has led to an increase in prices of many vegetables.Tomato and okra are among the vegetables that have shown a significant increase in recent days. In Chala, tomato costs between Rs. 60 to Rs. 70 a kg, but retail prices elsewhere in the city go up to Rs. 80 a kg.Shallots continue to make homemakers shed tears, with prices ranging from Rs. 80 a kg for wholesale to Rs. 140 in retail shops for the best quality.SeasonalSays a commission agent at Chala: Prices are on the rise owing to a drop in production. This is seasonal. Take onion for instance. As onion prices are low in producer States following bumper production, not many farmers will be inclined to grow onion. Those who do will get a good price next year as prices will increase when supply dwindles. This is also the case with shallots. With less stock availability, prices are bound to shoot up. However, there has been a dip in wholesale prices of shallots, he points out. Though shallots havent been reaching the market from Tamil Nadu, an improvement in climate in the crop-growing areas in Karnataka holds out some hope for a further reduction in prices.Yet there are vegetables such as thadiyan kaya which cost Rs. 35 a kg now. I dont remember it exceeding Rs. 20 a kg in recent times, he says.Another wholesale agent says that following a shortfall in tomato production in some States, traders from there reached Karnataka markets, affecting the supply to Kerala. The prices have shot up this much within a fortnight, says a retail vegetable seller.While cowpea (payar) is available for Rs. 40 a kg at Chala, the nadan variety costs Rs. 90-100.Green chilli has not lost its bite either, with prices hovering around Rs. 60 a kg for wholesale and Rs. 70 for retail.Carrot cost around Rs. 60, though cheaper ones can be had for Rs. 45 a kg, says an agent for a farmers producer company. There are three to four types of carrots and beans available, and prices vary for each. Carrot, from Rs. 54 the day before, has increased to Rs. 62. Beans is priced at Rs. 62.Daily fluctuations too have a role to play, and over the course of a week, prices may show a substantial increase or decrease. For instance, okra that cost Rs. 57 a kg a week ago has dipped to Rs. 36 for wholesale and Rs. 40 for retail. Drumstick price too has come down to Rs. 50 a kg. Indian cucumber though is expensive.One retailer at Chala says good quality carrots are available for less than Rs. 50 a kg. But okra in his shop costs Rs. 50 a kg, though it used to cost less than Rs. 20 a kg a month ago.QualityA couple of retailers say they stock the best quality and hence prices are on the higher side for their veggies. Yet, this argument does not go down well with customers who complain of being fleeced.Price intervention, however, does not work much, say the traders.Prices of vegetables that are expensive now will come down in a month or so, some say. Yet others think the trend will continue till Chingam."

For, after sliding down from as high as Rs 70 per kg in the beginning of July, tomatoes are back to turning people red with anger at having to shell out anywhere between Rs 70 and Rs 100 per kg.One kg of tomatoes, which was priced at Rs 38 in the state-run Rythu Bazaar last Tuesday, was back to reigning at Rs 70 per kg this Tuesday.Confirming that prices have been spiraling out of control, the state agriculture department authorities said that it is highly unlikely that the situation will improve anytime soon because of a shortfall in tomato cultivation in the state.Explaining the reason for fluctuating prices, B Babu, an officer of the department, said that after the initial price rise in the beginning of July (as heavy rainfall left standing crop damaged), the authorities began importing tomatoes from neighbouring states, bringing down prices for a while.""Farmers in the state did not take up vegetable farming completely . If they had one acre of land, they only planted vegetables on one-fourth of it,"" said Babu, adding that only 65 % of the total area under vegetable cultivation in the state was planted this year.Farmers are reportedly taking up partial planting to avoid facing losses due to na tural reasons, like last year's flooding or the drought-like situation that was prevalent over the state in the couple of years before that.""Farmers say that they are not able to make any profits as their produce is being taken away by middle-men, who take the produce into the city markets. If this is the case, there is bound to be gaps in the demand and supply of vegetables in the city,"" said Naveen Ramsetty, state committee member, Rythu Swarajya Vedika.The city, he said, procures nearly 90% of its vegetables from two places, Kurnool and Madanapally village in Chittoor district."
