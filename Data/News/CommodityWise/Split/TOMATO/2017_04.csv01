This staple item is selling for Rs 70-80 in most parts of the city as well as Thane and Navi Mumbai.Citizens have been tweeting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to take action. The holy month of Shravan began in north India on Monday. The fasting season according to the Maharashtrian and Gujarati calendar starts July 24. As families abstain from non-vegetarian food during this time, consumption of tomato rises.Traders have no explanation for the increase other than ""unseasonal rain"". They say the situation will continue through August. This is bewildering given that farmers were dumping produce in the streets as tomato rates crashed to Re 1 per kg a few weeks ago.In Andheri market, vendor Umar said, ""We are selling good quality fruit for Rs 100 because we are purchasing for Rs 75 in the wholesale market. This stock comes from Bangalore. The crop in Maharashtra has failed due to excessive rain."" Last week, the largest trader in APMC had cited a slew of reasons including ""demonetisation, farmers' strike and bad weather"".On Monday, buyers in Thane market, Bandra and Andheri restricted themselves to purchasing half a kg. Others chose to avoid tomato. ""The greengrocer cheekily asked me why I did not want to buy tomato since I had bought other vegetables. I retorted that at Rs 80 per kg, he was welcome to keep his produce,"" said Shiuli Banerjee of Malad.Kitchens are forced to explore alternatives. Borivli housewife Rosemary Fernandes recommended that households try vinegar while Maya Mirchandani of Andheri recommended thickening the gravy with sour curd or tamarind pulp. Banerjee suggested lime juice and kokum to add sourness, and gravies thickened with potato and cornflour to tide over the crisis.Prices of onion-tomato have maintained a steady average of Rs 15-20 per kg since 2014. In previous years, the country had seen a biannual spike in rates from March-May and October-December as traders cited ""seasonal shortages"" owing to the vagaries of monsoon. This inexplicable spike has brought consumers' worst fears back to haunt them."

So, yesterday I decided to go to the market and check it out myself. The usual guy we go to had only two kilos of tomatoes left which he was selling for `110 a kilo! When I asked him to reduce the rates, he said he doesn't have enough stock on him and thus can't lower the price.""With the rise in the prices of tomatoes, there are many who feel that it is the Goods and Services Tax (GST) that is responsible for it. Shashi Verma, a resident of central suburbs says, ""We normally go to the nearest Chembur market to do our vegetable shopping. But, two days back when we went there, tomatoes were being sold for `85-100 a kilo. When we asked the vendor about the high price, he said it was because of GST.""Adding to this, a vegetable vendor from the western suburbs says, ""We were told that it is because of the farmer's strike and GST. After the strike got over, the prices went down to `40-50 a kilo. Just before GST, they were being sold for `60 a kilo and now they've reached the maximum  `80-100 a kilo.""While the blame game is still on, a spokesperson from the APMC market in Vashi (wholesale market) feels the need to clear the air. He says, ""People should not believe in such rumours. The hike in the price is not because of GST or farmer's strike at all. It is the lack of rains this year which has to be blamed for the rise in prices. Also, most of the stock have got damaged while being brought to the city and thus most vendors had to throw them away.""Prabha Saoba a resident of Wadala says that the wholesale markets are selling tomatoes at far reasonable rates than the ones which are being sold at retail markets. She says, ""I travelled all the way to Vashi to check out the prices of tomatoes and was surprised that it was being sold for `55-60 a kilo whereas in my area, tomatoes are being sold for `100-120 a kilo.""Rakesh, a vegetable vendor at Pali Hill market in Bandra, says, ""We don't have a choice but to increase the rates of tomatoes. If we buy a kilo for `70-80, we try and sell it for `100-110, so that we can make some profit, else our business won't thrive.""While consumers don't have much choice but buy tomatoes at the rate their local vendor is offering, there are many who are offering discounts to their loyal customers. Vegetable vendor Ramesh Gupta from South Mumbai says, ""Since it isn't easy to give a discount on half a kilo of tomatoes or even less than that, we encourage our customers to shop over a kilo so that we can waive off anything between `30 or `50 on the bulk purchases.""Many took to online purchase of veggies once they got to know about the sky-high prices of tomatoes. However, they did not find solace there as well. Shraddha Vaidyanathan, a resident of Thane says, ""The day the prices shot up, my husband sat down to order tomatoes online. However, he called me up an hour later to tell me that the prices are high there too (about `86 a kilo). There was no point, so in the evening, we went to the local veggie guy and bargained with him and got a kilo of tomato for `75.Rakesh says, ""Consumers are buying on a day-to-day basis, according to their usage."" Adding to this businessman Hemant Shah says, ""If not consumed, vegetables have a high chance of rotting. Also, the tomatoes which are being sold in the market at the moment, are not in a good condition. Thus, the trouble of shopping for it on a daily basis."""
5a078caa9855b76bf13caff9,Rise in onion price disrupts veggie budget further,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/rise-in-onion-price-disrupts-veggie-budget-further/articleshow/59837978.cms,2017-07-31,"LUCKNOW: After tomato, onions are ripping the monthly budget with an increase of up to 70% in its cost in the past couple of days. Until last week, onion was selling at Rs 15-18 per kg but this week it has reached Rs 25-30 per kg. As they are used in almost all dishes, rise in prices of tomato and onions always disrupts the household budget.Wholesale price of onion has gone up from Rs 6-8 per kg to Rs 15-18 per kg. As per traders, the hike is because of incessant rains in Maharashtra , from where the state and city gets maximum supply.Another major reason is GST (Goods and Services Tax). ""Most of the transport companies have not revised their systems under GST so very few trucks are plying. Lack of carriage has hit supply, and in turn, the cost,"" said Arvind, a wholesale vegetable dealer of Dubagga.""Also, because of monsoon, the transportation time has increased from three to five days, which turns onions stale. More than 30% of them are discarded because of poor quality,"" said Sheraz Sadiq, another vendor.With seasonal vegetables already selling at a relatively high price because of heavy rains in the producing states, the overall cost of raw vegetables has sky-rocketed in the city.Housewife Shruti Singh said, ""Because of vegetables getting costlier, especially onions and tomatoes , the cost of each meal has gone up. Cooking chicken is cheaper than preparing a vegetarian dinner. Worst part is that though vegetables can be replaced by meat, there is no substitute for onions.""Bank employee Ritika Sharma said she has resorted to buying vegetables from wholesale market even though she has to buy a week's quota in advance. ""Shopping from mandi costs a little less than from street vendors, so I go to Dubagga mandi and buy whatever I want all at once,"" she said.Though the cost of tomato has dropped in wholesale markets in the past few days, it continues to sell at Rs 100-120 per kg in the city. ""For the past three days, tomatoes are selling at Rs 60-65 per kg in the wholesale market. Price dropped because supply is getting back to normal,"" said Rizwan, wholesale trader."
5a078d7b9855b76bf13cb04f,Can you regulate the price of tomato?,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/can-you-regulate-the-price-of-tomato/articleshow/59832218.cms,2017-07-31,"When the price of tomatoes soared up like never before this year, to occasionally cost even more than `100 per kg, it got a few folks in the State pondering what should be done to counter it?While a few homemakers started looking for cheaper alternatives, others depended on international methods to tackle it.The response was similar to when chicken prices shot up and many wanted to wait till the price fell. Better Kochi Response Group, a community that consists of doctors, chartered accountants, civil servants and more, has been urging people via various online forums, to stay away from tomatoes for the next fortnight, by which they believe the price should dip.Will it, really? Kochi Times quizzed fiscal experts, customer behaviour analysts and more, to see how such a tactic might play out.Customer behaviour expert Sony V Mathew says, ""I don't think anything can stop customers from buying an item, at least in smaller quantities. However, they can have an effect on the price when they become responsible buyers. For example, many shopkeepers tell me that people now buy tomatoes in quantities ranging from 100 grams to just two pieces."" That, in turn, will affect a perishable product like tomato, explain analysts.Is it illegal to influence an item's price, collectively? ""If someone tries to increase the price artificially, it is unacceptable. But there is nothing wrong if the buyers decide they want to stay away from buying a costly item,"" Sony says.Jose Sebastian, a Kochi-based fiscal expert, says, ""Tomato is a perishable product and therefore, if people decide not to purchase it, sellers will be naturally forced to reduce the price, especially in a State like Kerala where people can do without this product. Those belonging to the lower strata of the society will avoid it as soon as the price increases.""Currently, the price of tomato is on the higher side because of the short supply and also due to higher income groups buying it at the steep cost, he says.""However, if they too decide to steer clear off tomatoes as a result of social media campaigning, ideally, the prices must come down,"" explains Jose.Elaborating on this strategy, S Gopakumar of Better Kochi Response Group explains, ""This is a model of protest that has been successfully used in countries like Japan. Around the time we started the protest a few days ago, the cost of tomato was around `110. In the following days it came down to `85 and I am sure that it will go down further, if we persist with this strategy. Our target is to stabilise it between `50 and `60 and we are spreading this strategy through mediums like Whatsapp.""Tomato is a relatively new entrant in Kerala cuisine and can be easily done away with, say culinary experts. Renowned chef Noushad says, ""It's mostly when we prepare North Indian dishes that we use tomatoes. It can be easily replaced in our dishes. In sambar and rasam, it can be replaced with tamarind. In avial, curd can do the trick. Even in salads, it's not an absolutely necessary item.""He observes that households use tomato while preparing dishes like butter chicken and chicken roast. ""Even for these, we can use tomato puree,"" he says.Sony says that the price rise has also started out a positive trend. ""People have started growing tomatoes in their own homes. What they need for a few curries on a daily basis can be easily sourced from a kitchen garden, a few customers happened to tell me. If the price rise can at least push more people into cultivating enough for their own kitchen, it should be helpful in the long run,"" he says."

According to senior officials, 22 quintals of tomatoes had been sold at the Rythu Bazars in the last three days alone.Presently, a kilo of tomato costs between Rs 85 andRs 100 in Poorna Market. Even road-side vendors are charging in excess of Rs 80-Rs 90 a kg. To make it affordable, the marketing department has fixed the price at Rs 64 a kilo.Speaking to TOI, the marketing department assistant director M Kaleswara Rao said, ""We stocked 10,525 kgs of tomatoes on Saturday for sale at the special counters for next one or two days. We have so far sold around 22 quintals of the tomatoes at the Rythu Bazars.""According to Rao, all the Rythu Bazars need nearly 17,500 kgs of tomatoes to meet the demand from the consumers in a day.""Due to shortage of the tomatoes country-wide, we are forced to source the supply of around 10000 kgs from Kolar in Karnataka . The supply from the Madanapalle market in Chittoor has stopped. We are now getting the tomatoes from Kolar only,"" Rao added.MVP Rythu Bazar estate officer T Linga Murthy said that the nearly 10 counters in the Rythu Bazar were allowed to sell the tomatoes to avoid the rush from the consumers. ""We used to encounter problems like people standing in large lines in the case of selling onions last time at the rythu bazar,"" Murthy said.Marripalem Rythu Bazar estate officer G Prasad said, ""Selling the tomatoes for Rs 64 a kilo at the special counters by the marketing department is highest in last one decade. Last time, we had sold tomatoes Rs 44 per kilo in August in the special counters."""

This year, though, tomatoes are selling at a premium due to a fall in supply, making farmers rich.Venkatappa B, 55, of Kurubarahalli in Kolar, returned to his field after selling the day's tomato yield in the market. He told TOI, ""It's a rare occasion for us when the tomato yield shows indications of good returns. Though we hear that tomatoes are being sold at Rs 80 to Rs 100 per kg, we get only around Rs 50. But the price is a lot better, considering we used to sell tomatoes at Rs 2 per kg when there was no demand.""Pradeep Kumar from Srinivasapura taluk said a tomato farmer invests a minimum of Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3 lakh per acre of production and the crop matures in four months. ""If there is no proper price in the market, we don't get even the labour charges to pluck tomatoes. This is the reason farmers throw them on the road,"" he said. Though farmers are benefiting from the prices this time around, they are worried because the yield per acre has come down. ""We thought we could reap the benefits of good tomato prices but there is a problem. I have 8 acres for tomatoes and used to take 1,000 boxes (each of 15 kg) every day to the market. But this time, I could take only 200 boxes. We don't get proper groundwater even after drilling up to 1,200 feet. Lack of water, increased temperatures and diseases have resulted in low production,"" said Anand Reddy , another farmer."

Even allergy to dal items also seems to be uncommon, states 'A cross sectional study of the profile of food allergy among patients with chronic urticaria in Kerala'.The study was conducted by the department of pulmonary medicine, Government TD Medical College, Alappuzha, to identify the skin sensitivity to various food allergens in patients with chronic urticaria and to analyse the regional pattern of food allergy in Kerala. The study shows that 98% of patients with chronic urticaria had some form of food allergy. The common offending food allergens were wheat (28%), garlic (22%), ground nut (20%), cashew nut (18%), prawns (17%), ginger (16%), peas (12%) and black pepper (10%).""Food allergy can occur in isolation or in association with various clinical conditions such as chronic urticaria. The prevalence of food allergy is on the rise, owing probably to the changing food habits, multiplicity of food items with innumerable components and overuse of food additives and colouring agents. Identifying the offending allergens and avoidance is one of the most important measures which may help in the management of skin allergy,"" said Dr Venugopal Panicker, additional professor, department of pulmonary medicine, Government TD Medical College, Alappuzha, and one of the authors of the study.Urticaria, also called hives or wheals, is a common disorder with a prevalence of around 15%-20% in the general population, with patient complaining of severe itching and redness of the skin. The itching of the skin in case of chronic urticaria is more prominent at night. Prevalence of chronic urticaria is around 1% in general population and both children and adults can develop it. Women are affected twice as often as men and the common age group affected is between 30 and 50 years.Published in the Journal of Evidence Based Medicine and Healthcare (JEBMH), the study selected 100 patients with chronic urticaria who had predisposition towards developing certain allergic hypersensitivity reactions.""The treatment of chronic urticaria is challenging and if the aetiology is food allergy, the patients can lead a normal life by simply avoiding the offending foods and its components. Almost 79% patients with food allergy are allergic to multiple allergens,"" added Dr Panicker."

The government had earlier seen a similar problem with onion and potato traders and was successful in breaking those,"" said a senior official. As far as Monday's strike is concerned, he said, it is being done by a small section of traders and the government is not anticipating any severe disruption.The section of traders that has called the strike said the agricultural produce marketing committee (APMC) had sent a notice to the other side, saying they should vacate seven tomato and three mausambi sheds that they had illegally occupied. ""If there was a genuine misunderstanding, why would APMC issue them the notice? It is a clear proof that even the government found those traders in the wrong. In that case, why is there a reallocation of sheds?"" asked a trader.The strike, if it is as severe as traders claim it would be, may impact availability of fruits and vegetables and their price.

Traders have warned of a further increase in price if their protests continue.Two sections of growers, each accusing the other of having occupied the sheds illegally, have been sitting on dharnas at the wholesale market for a week.

The notice gives them three days after its receipt to remove their boards.""If APMC has issued them notices for illegal occupation , why is the government bent upon reallocation of sheds.

Traders said the prices will continue to soar for the next few weeks due to the lack of supply from the local region.The Tamil month of Aadhi begins on Monday. It is the month of festivals and ceremonies, and feasts are held in temples throughout this month. Accordingly, the prices of vegetables go up during this season due to the increased demand. However, this year the price of tomato, which was Rs 30/kg during the same season last year, has already touched Rs 80/kg in the wholesale market, indicating that this is also going to be an expensive festive season. Central Market tomato traders association president R S P Sekhar said that they usually get around 10,000 boxes of tomatoes daily at the market, with each box containing 15 kilograms of tomatoes, but now the supply has dropped to only 4000 boxes.The price of one box of tomato in the wholesale market was Rs 1,000 on Sunday, and it sold at Rs 60/kg in the Central market, but the better quality fruits were priced at Rs 80, he said. The same was witnessed at the farmers markets in the city.K Ramesh of Viswanathapuram, said that he had gone to the Chokkikulam farmers market, where he was not given the liberty to pick the tomatoes. ""I was told all the fruits were good and that one kilogram cost Rs 80, so I bought half a kilogram because he price is too high to be burdened with a couple of rotten tomatoes,'' he said.In Anna Nagar, S Ganeswari purchased a quarter kilogram for Rs 24. ""A kilogram was being sold for Rs 96 and the trader told me he would give it for Rs 95 if I purchased a kilogram. Who wants to buy tomatoes for so much?'' she said. V Chellam , a trader, said that the supply from the local farms in Theni and Dindigul district, where tomato is usually cultivated in thousands of acres, was almost nil at present and the market was getting its supply from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh . ""There doesn't seem to be a possibility of getting supplies from the local farmers at least for the next two months, so the price will only continue to go up and may touch Rs 100 in the wholesale market soon,'' he said."

Farmers say Rs 80 per kg for tomato is very high for this period of the year. Usually, vegetables such as tomato would be sold at throwaway prices during Aadi. This year, the cultivated area was less compared to previous years, due to water shortage. Also, the yield per acre has come down. ""On a normal year, the summer harvest will yield 10-20 tonnes of tomato per acre. Because of water shortage and extreme heat, the yield has dropped by 60% this year,"" said Senthil Kumar , a tomato farmer from Madhampatti.Farmers said they didn't expect the prices to drop further, a phenomenon usually witnessed as Aadi progresses. ""We have postponed harvest of onion to September after the rains,'' said Vijaykumar, a farmer, hinting that if at all there was a further price fall it would be after September. However, the cost of green chillies has been steadily increasing over the past one week, from Rs 30-Rs 40 per kg to Rs 88 on Tuesday. ""This is because chillies are coming from Mysuru. We are yet to get local stock from Erode, Chettipalayam and Thalavadi,'' said R Satheesh, a vegetable vendor at MGR Market."

This has forced them to hike rates urging us also to maintain the same. There will be no relief until this changes,"" said vendor Sadiq Shaikh.TOI had reported last week that poor rain in Maharashtra and Karnataka had led to a serious shortage in crop output. Resultantly leading to the low tomato produce and subsequent shortage.Weather parameters in Goa have also played foul for vendors in Goa. ""While supplying freshly-harvested tomatoes to the state, some of the stock got ruined after being hit by rains along Goa's ghats. Tomatoes unlike onions and potatoes cannot be hoarded and are easily perishable,"" said another vendor.They further added that rates will continue to remain high for another fortnight or so. Until then, tomatoes continue to be out of the common man's reach.Sharing his thoughts on the scenario, agriculture director Ulhas Pai Kakode said, ""Currently, there is low tomato stock in the market available for sale, therefore the exorbitant rates.

The price of tomato has shot up by 25% in the past 15 days, with the vegetable selling for as much as Rs100 a kilo in some markets. Prices of other vegetables, such as capsicum and beans, have also shot up by Rs 20 akilo the the past two weeks.Vegetable retailers at Lake Market on Sunday sold tomato at Rs 100 a kilo, while prices in markets like the one at Manicktala hovered between Rs 95 and Rs 100 per kilo. ""Our hands are tied now. Prices have shown a sudden spurt at the wholesale markets in the past one week, and there has been an unprecedented rise,"" said Gopal Kundu , a retailer at Lake Market.In Koley market , one of the largest wholesale markets of the city, tomato sold at Rs 70 to Rs 72 a kilo. ""Most of the tomato supplies in Kolkata market come from Bengaluru at this time of year. There are price fluctuations every year, but this time it is beyond calculations,"" said Anup Gupta, a vegetable wholesaler at Koley Market.According to Uttam Mukherjee, chief supervisor of Koley market, supplies have come down by almost 30%. ""If a wholesaler was importing 10 trucks of tomatoes, he is now getting eight. Shortage in supplies is pushing up prices,"" he said. Some traders also procure tomato from wholesalers in Indore. ""We have never imagined that prices could go up to Rs 80 per kilo. There is a shortage in production. The Centre had provided support to farmers, but that seems to have had no reflection on the prices,"" said Sushil Soni, a tomato wholesaler in Indore, Madhya Pradesh.Vegetable traders on Sunday pointed out that agitating farmers across the country had destroyed truckloads of tomato last month. ""In some cases, the tomato crop was not even harvested,"" Soni said.Prices of other vegetables, mostly the ones procured from other states, have also headed north. ""Prices of capsicum and beans have gone up by Rs 20 per kilo in the last two weeks,"" said Kartik Saha , a vegetable retailer at Manicktala market.What has come as a breather is the stable price of local vegetables like striped gourd and brinjal. ""Prices of these vegetables have remained steady and are being sold between Rs 35 and Rs 40 per kilo,"" Mukherjee said.Buyers know there is going to be a rise and fall in the price of seasonal produce; it's a normal demand-and-supply thing playing itself out. But, when there is an abnormal and unchecked rise in the price of certain vegetables, then it may indicate something more than usual market forces at play. The situation calls for much stricter monitoring."

In the past week, tomato prices have skyrocketed leaving Bengalureans in a fix. While there is no clarity on what has caused the price rise, many feel that the Goods and Service Tax ( GST ) is the culprit behind it. Bangalore Times finds out more...BT found out that tomatoes were being sold in the market between Rs 75-90 per kilo. ""Of late the price of tomato has gone up. Last week when we brought tomatoes, it was Rs 74 per kg. Earlier, we used to pay as less as Rs 20 per kilo,"" says Pallavi Sengupta, a city-based professional, adding that the increased price has cut down the usage of tomatoes in her home by half. ""Since tomatoes are so expensive, we have cut down our usage by half and try our best not to waste any food,"" she says. But many like George Thomas, banking professional from the city, say that the increased price has not made a drastic change to their diet. ""I haven't faced an issue as such. Since I can afford it, I still buy the same amount of tomatoes. But am sure there are many who are facing problems and have cut down on their intake,"" he says.Nishtha Nayyar, a working professional in the city, says that she prefers buying vegetables especially tomatoes, from a vegetable market than a supermarket. ""We bought tomatoes for Rs 60 last week. Am sure in a supermarket it's as expensive as Rs 85 per kilo."" But has the increased price affected her in any way? ""Of course it has. We don't make dishes like pasta and others that require more tomatoes, as often as we used to. Since the price has gone up, I have become more conscious of the usage. In fact, my domestic help says that she has reduced using tomatoes in her household considerably,"" she adds.Contrary to the belief that GST may have a role in the price rise of tomatoes, vegetable vendors and owners tell us that GST has no bearing at all. ""Obviously there has been less rainfall  that has had an impact in the production. In addition to that, tomatoes are very cyclic. If one year the prices drop, the next year it shoots up,"" explains Amar Krishna Murthy, CEO, Towness. ""If the prices drop, people stop growing tomatoes. The following year, when the demand goes up there isn't enough quantity to meet the needs, which in turn results in the steep rise of prices,"" he says.Chandru, who works at a HOPCOMS stall, says that the monsoons have created a shortage. ""If we ask for 500 quintals, we get only 100 quintals. How will the demands be met?"" he asks, saying the scenario is likely to last for a month or so. He also clarifies that unlike what many think, GST has not affected the prices of vegetables and fruits. ""There is a solid shortage of tomatoes in the market,"" he adds.Another representative at Namdhari's Fresh, on the condition of anonymity, said that the prices of tomatoes are expected to remain the same for another month. ""It is all because of the monsoon. If the weather does not improve, the prices will continue to soar,"" he sums up. Amar, however, points out that he hasn't experienced a slump in sales as such, as tomato is one of the basic necessities in cooking. ""Tomato is hard to replace in cooking,"" he says adding that people are still buying it online inspite of the price rise."

At present, Delhi is only getting tomatoes from Himachal,"" he said.Across the city , buyers started to panic as the price of tomatoes zoomed by about Rs 20-40 since the beginning of the month.

Prices are likely to increase further in coming days, said vegetable traders, adding that monsoon arrived late this year which led to poor crop of seasonal vegetables, while heavy rains later damaged the produce. Tomato was worst hit by rainfall in Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh.Seasonal vegetables hit by unfavourable weather conditions include brinjal, ladyfinger, bitter gourd, colocasia and potatoes. Cost of bottle guard, pumpkin, pointed guard and cauliflower has dropped up to 40%.Wholesale dealer Shahikant Singh said, ""Rains damaged the tomato crop in Karnataka and also affected its transport."" Another wholesale dealer Kripal said, ""The supply has yet to normalise, hence cost of tomato and other vegetables will increase further.""Vegetables that have become cheaper are those which are grown locally or within the state. There was a glut since the produce could not be sent to other states because of heavy rains, so their prices went down. Also, these vegetables don't have a long shelf life, so vendors are selling them for less.Housewife Pooja Rastogi said, ""The hike in prices of tomato and potato is pinching most as there is hardly any dish one can make without these two.

With prices hovering around Rs 100/kg since about a fortnight now, the humble tomato  which is scientifically a fruit but commonly known as a vegetable owing to its rampant use in cooking savoury rather than sweet meals  is giving a fright to the common man. While vendors at some of the local markets claim that the price hike is due to interrupted supply because of the rains, those in the food business are among the worst hit. With tomato prices going through the roof, many are resorting to substitutes like canned puree and ketchup, leading to their dwindling stocks at various departmental stores.Gurleen Singh, owner of Hindusthan Dhaba , said they are bearing a loss of 3-4% at the moment. ""We are hoping that the situation will get better in the coming weeks. If the crisis persists, we will be forced to increase the price of our dishes by `5-`10 on an average,"" he said, explaining that gravy items, especially makhnis, are cooked with fresh tomatoes. However, Rahul Arora, proprietor of Paranthe Wali Galli , said their business remains unaffected as they don't use fresh tomatoes and cook with tomato puree instead.""We get our stock of canned tomato puree and since the price of that has not increased, we are not feeling the pinch,"" he told us. Chef Rangan Niyogi seconded Rahul as he said tomato puree is indeed a preferred ingredient in Indian kitchens. ""Readymade tomato puree is a great help in times of crisis. It can be used for churning out a variety of dishes. Generally, we use fresh tomatoes in numerous Indian dishes, like chicken butter masala, dal makhni, methi saag, aloo dum etc. But, currently I am using tinned tomato puree in place of fresh tomatoes and Kashmiri mirch in place of red chilli powder to make them taste close to tomato. However, in case of tomato chutney, it's not possible to substitute fresh tomatoes. For making tomato or minestrone soup, I am using carrot and tomato puree in place of fresh tomato. While carrot lends the vegetable flavour, tomato puree helps in getting the right taste and colour of the soup,"" he said.According to local vendors, tomato prices shooting up during this season is a common occurrence as rains spoil the stock. Tomatoes that have a shelf life of 3-4 days are hard to stock up at a time not many farmers have access to cold storage. Chef Joymalya Banerjee , however, feels the crisis is ""created"". ""Monsoon comes every year and it's not believable that the entire stock got ruined due to exceptional rains. Yet, there's a dearth in supply. So, if I ask vendors to deliver 5 kilos, they are giving only 2 kilos. This has been happening for the past two weeks,"" he said. The chef added that he doesn't believe in passing the burden on to the consumers. ""Everyone in the restaurant business keeps a buffer. For example, if the making cost of a dish is `10, it's sold at `30. For the loss of a rupee or so, it's not feasible to hike the price of a dish. There was a time when potato prices were hiked to an extent that some biryani makers dropped the aloo from the dish. That was juvenile, as it's not fair to victimise consumers all the time. I will hike the prices only when I can't bear the burden anymore,"" he reasoned.Though tomato prices started coming down on Wednesday and were available at `80 a kilo at some places, online grocery platforms such as Big Basket and Grofers continued to sell the kitchen must at over `100 a kilo. It was `109 a kilo at Big Basket and `110 a kilo at Grofers on Thursday. Cherry tomatoes and the organic variety came at `280 and `172.50 a kilo respectively."

5a0b2b129855b76bf13cd08a,"Fruit for thought: To pay less for tomatoes, can prejudice",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/ruminations/fruit-for-thought-to-pay-less-for-tomatoes-can-prejudice/,2017-07-16,"Whether you pronounce it to-may-to or to-maa-to (or tamaatar), there is nothing very Indian about the tomate, as Spanish Conquistadors called the fruit (yes, it is a fruit) that grew wild in the Andes. The word tomato itself comes from the word tomatl, its name in the Aztec language Nahuatl. Anglophones likely corrupted it to rhyme with potato. The French, trust them, called it pommes damour (love apples), believing it had aphrodisiacal properties.Stop right there if you are reaching for one. Even without libidinal attributes, the price of this squishy everyday companion to cooking (along with onion) has already hit a new high in India, arousing ire. At Rs 70 a kilo last week, it surpassed the price of mangoes that are on their way out of the market. By this weekend, it had raced into record territory at Rs 100-plus a kilo.Famously, the rising price of tur daal and onion  our meat and potatoes  is something governments are leery of. But tomato is, by comparison, an orphan.Remember, it was only weeks ago that we read about tomato growers in distress  selling their produce at as low as one rupee a kilo or simply throwing it away in protest on highways in drama reminiscent of La Tomatina, the festival held in the town of Buol, Spain  sans the festivities. In fact, this appears to be as much an annual occurrence in parts of India  particularly in the districts of Nasik and Kolar, the biggest tomato-growing areas  as the Valencian festival. What gives?At first blush, it would seem the tomato is getting squished entirely by seasonal factors and market forces, like so much other agricultural produce in India  particularly fruits and vegetables  that does not get government support price. Growing tomatoes is particularly dicey, says Aruna Urs, a farmer-in-residence at the think-tank Takshashila Institution, comparing it to a Las Vegas crapshoot. Unseasonal rain or unexpected heat, a mandi strike or market glut, could be the difference between boom and bust.Over the years, farmers have learned to navigate the treacherous terrain  not always successfully  using seeds that yield thick-skinned tomatoes (for longevity and ease of transport) and timing the pick to market. Urs himself speaks of planting this April by car headlights in the dead of the night to catch the right temperature (too warm and the seeds die).The result has been a bonanza  Rs 68/kilo in the wholesale market last week when anything above Rs 10/kilo is considered rich pickings. So if farmers who got crushed by Rs 1/kg price during the market glut are making a killing at Rs 100 a kilo, who can blame them? By the way, stories about middlemen milking it are vastly exaggerated. They do, but not to the extent of some of the tomato crorepati farmers who gamble by leasing hundreds of acres in what is a high-wire  high-vine  act.Still, the price variation of 100x is not just a factor of seasons and market forces, but also of cultural and culinary habits. India is notoriously shy of eating frozen and canned goods. No self-respecting Indian would be caught using tomato that is in any way processed or pureed, sliced or diced, into a can or container. Thanks to vast tracts of arable and fecund lands, landing fresh produce is no problem in most parts of the country even if there is a groundwater crisis.By contrast, in the US, where tomato accounts for 22% of vegetable consumption (outside the technicality of it being a fruit), more than 50% of tomatoes are consumed as tomato products  processed, pureed, pasted etc. What did the papa tomato say to the baby tomato? A: Hurry and ketchup! goes the joke. Q: How do you get rid of unproductive tomatoes? A: Can them. As a result, retail price of tomatoes in the US has hovered between a low of $1.21 and a high $2.47 per pound over the last 20 years  nothing like the Rs 1 to Rs 100 variation in India.To be sure, theres enormous merit in the way Indians consume fresh produce, including the tomato in all its fiery colour and cool completeness (Pablo Neruda). Instead of eating fruits and vegetables in their original state, much of the West, particularly the US, soup them up with sodium and sugar, adding needless calories and subtracting dietary fibre. Last year, the grocery chain Whole Foods invited outrage and ridicule by selling pre-peeled oranges.But there is now sufficient research to show that frozen produce is not always nutritionally leached, and in some cases, enhances it. Sans sodium, canned is not dicey either. Of course, there is nothing to beat fresh, but as long as India does not accept enforced longevity of produce, both farmers and consumers will have to periodically deal with crapshoots in the fruit and vegetable market."

Supplies of onions in Market Yard have dwindled because of rotting in the godowns during the rains.Meanwhile, the price of tomato , the other kitchen staple, simmered to Rs 50-60 per kg from Rs 100 in July. Dilip Khaire, chief administrator of Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), Pune told TOI that the rainy season often sees fluctuation in prices because of the problem it poses for reaping vegetables from the fields.""The recent rise in onion prices is the result of stocks rotting in the godowns they are stored in during the recent rain,"" Khaire said. He added that vegetable crops are susceptible to disease during the rainy season. ""Areas around Pune, such as Velhe, Mulshi, Bhor, Ambegaon and Junnar, that are to the west of Pune received good rainfall in the last few days, which caused supply problems in many vegetables, including onions,"" he saidNew onion stocks will enter the markets post-Diwali, Khaire added. APMC officials had earlier told TOI that incessant rain after mid-July damaged the tomato crops, causing supply to fall and prices to go up to Rs 100 per kg.Onion supply data from APMC showed that since August 1, when close to 11,423 quintals of onions came into the APMC market, supplies dipped to 9,615 quintals on August 2 and 8,985 quintals on August 3.Though 18,760 quintals of onion entered the wholesale market on August 4, prices continued their upward trendfrom Rs 700 to Rs 1,500 on August 1 to Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,600 on August 4. Another APMC official said onions in the wholesale market were being sold at around Rs 22 per kg on Thursday, which went up to Rs 25 on Friday.""The reduction in rainfall over the last few days has also caused a dip in cultivation of vegetables, including onions,"" he said. Yakub Pathan, owner, Fresh Vegetable Market, Wakad, said the retail price of onion is bound to be higher on Saturday.""From Rs 30 on Friday, it may go up to Rs 35 to Rs 40 on Saturday depending on the supply with retailers. Tomato supplies have normalized to an extent, but onion supplies are 50% less in the wholesale market on account of some stocks rotting due to rains,"" said Pathan.Vegetable vendors in the city on Friday were selling onions at Rs 30 per kg, as against Rs 15 on August 2. ""Tomato prices have come down to Rs 50-Rs 60. Though tomato prices have come down there is less supply,"" Inder Sen, a vendor in Koregaon Park, said."
5a0b440a9855b76bf13cd90a,Tomato price touches Rs. 100 a kg,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tomato-price-touches-rs-100-a-kg/article19255222.ece,2017-07-11,"Tomato @ Rs. 100 a kg has become the talk of the town all over Chittoor district, in spite of it having South Indias largest tomato market at Madanapalle. The impact is also felt all over the South and the northern States. Currently, the crop is not raised in Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan due to adverse climatic conditions. These two States are the usual competitors to the Madanapalle grades.During the last one month, the tomato trade has been playing truant with not only the farmers, but also agents from across India, and the domestic retail market in Chittoor, Kadapa, Anantapur and Bellary (Karnataka). The price which stood at Rs. 20 a kg in the first week of June started taking giant leaps week after week, and now reached a level virtually creating panic among the public at Rs. 100 a kg.Alarming dip in arrivalsAs per the latest trend, the wholesale market price on Monday stood at Rs. 78 per kg (first grade) and the second grade at Rs. 48-54 per kg (based on quality and size). The arrival for the day was 241 metric tonnes. There had been an alarming dip in the arrivals since a week from 400 MT last week, followed by 311 MT on Thursday last and 277 MT on Sunday. In contrast, arrivals peaked to 750 MT per day in June-July 2016.The first grade stock, forming 40% of the arrivals, is exported to the metros in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and MP and some malls in Tirupati, Chittoor and Srikalahasti in the district. The second grade is sent to the urban centres of Chittoor district with a mind-blowing retail price at Rs. Rs. 90-100 a kg in vegetable markets and petty shops.This is double the wholesale price. Same situation is reported from elsewhere in towns of surrounding districts of Anantapur, Kadapa; and bordering Kolar and Chikballapur districts of Karnataka, while the price is even slightly up in the border areas of Tamil Nadu. The steep hike is attributed to the damage of the stock during transit, escalation of transportation charges and poor shelf life.Turns invisibleThe impact is clearly felt on the hotel industry and households.A majority of home-makers are forced to substitute the prized vegetable with tamarind juice. The roadside eateries and pani-poori carts are doubly cautious while using it; and it has turned invisible in salads of considerably big restaurants and bars. Though most customers tend to avoid buying it, retail and petty traders are not affected by the scenario, with the smooth disposal of small stocks thanks to a limited number of customers essentially in need of the temporarily unreachable vegetable. Meanwhile, traders said the situation would ease by mid August."

Amid reports of differences in the price at various retail outlets, the city administration came to the rescue of the locals by making onions available for `20 per kg at 37 government-run fair price shops.Assistant Civil Supplies Officer (ACSO) R C Tudu said 35 quintals of onions were supplied to fair price shops on Saturday. He further pointed out that the retail price of onion at some places rose to `28 per kg on Sunday, with the wholesalers claiming the price of fresh consignment to be `2,400 per quintal. The wholesalers are selling onions for `2,600 per quintal after adding the transportation cost, Tudu added.The officer claimed that the fair price shops will sell fresh stocks at no profit-no loss basis, adding that each wholesaler has been allowed to maintain a maximum stock of 300 quintals.There are no reports of hoarding at the local level. The citys estimated consumption of onions per day is about 130 quintals, claim sources in Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare department. Meanwhile, the hike in prices of vegetables has added to the woes of the consumers. The rise in onion price is an additional burden with tomato selling at `70-80 per kg, and most of the vegetables being sold at `40 and above, a housewife, Manavi Sharma, said."
5a0b4a749855b76bf13cdd3f,Now  tomato prices hit Rs. 100 a kg.,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/now-tomato-prices-hit-rs-100-a-kg/article19274831.ece,2017-07-14,"A supply glut has sent retail prices of tomatoes through the roof, with the popular vegetable hitting Rs. 100 a kilo in markets across the city and its suburbs. According to retailers, this is perhaps the first time that tomato prices have crossed the Rs. 100 mark, according to retailers. The higher quality tomatoes from Bangalore cost a bit more at Rs. 120 a kg in Mumbai, they said.Every monsoon, prices would go up to around Rs. 80 due to shortage, but this time it is worse. There is an acute shortage in the market, Harishchandra Gupta, a vegetable vendor in the western suburbs, said.Sources said the sudden shortage in tomatoes is a direct fallout of the state-wide protest by farmers last month. They said rampaging mobs of farmers demanding loan waivers had destroyed truckloads of tomatoes across the State. This, sources said, had forced a large number of marginal tomato farmers to destroy their standing crop as they feared the protest could continue.Small farmers were scared. The off-take from their fields had stopped. Fearing more loss, they preferred to uproot the standing crop much before the harvest and plant other crops. This has lead to a supply problem, which is expected to continue till August, a tomato trader said.In just two days, prices have gone up from Rs. 80 per kg to Rs. 100 per kg. Two months ago, tomato was selling at Rs. 16 per kg.This is the part of the year when Maharashtra supplies tomatoes to many parts of the country including north India. The shortage at in the State has not only pushed prices up in Mumbai, but also in U.P., Rajesh Kumar, a vegetable seller, said.Prices up at retail chainsAt supermarkets like Big Bazaar, tomatoes were selling for Rs. 85 to Rs. 90 per kg. Surprisingly, prices at the comparatively upmarket Godrej Natures Basket was lower at Rs. 67 per kg. Analysts said this is because such stores have long term supply contracts with growers.Tomato prices touched Rs. 80 in Mira-Bhayandar and Vasai-Virar, evoking strong reactions from homemakers. Its not possible to buy tomatoes any more, said Ruma Bose, a Vasai resident.Officials at the Agricultural Produce Marketing Corporation (APMC), Vashi said the supply of tomatoes has gone down by nearly half. While the demand across the city and its suburbs is more close to 3,000 quintal per day, today only about 1,290 quintal has come to the APMC, an APMC official said.Shivaji Pahinkar, secretary, APMC Vashi, said wholesale prices hovered between Rs. 45 and Rs. 60 per kg on Thursday. Declining to pinpoint why tomato supply has dried up, Mr. Pahinkar attributed it to the vagaries of crop production and market economics. We cannot say for sure why there is a surge in prices, he said, while ruling out GST as a factor.Regional mandis (markets) from where retailers procure their supplies are charging between Rs. 70 and Rs. 80 per kg, which is being sold in retail at Rs. 100. We are not responsible for the retail prices, said Mr Pahinkar. You can add 30% to our prices for transport and miscellaneous charges, he added.Ramkrishna Yadav, a vegetable seller at Mira Road, is not happy with the soaring prices.We plan on picking up a certain amount of vegetables at the wholesale market, but we come away with much less as prices are high. This has been the situation for the past fortnight.Ganesh Pinglay, a wholesaler in Vashi, said this price rise could be due to shortfall in production. A couple of months ago, tomato prices hit rock bottom, and farmers could not even recover their production cost, so they didnt go ahead with the second tomato crop. Now they will plant another crop, which should come to the market in another month-and-a-half, he said.Two months ago, tomato prices fell so much farmers couldnt recover production cost, so they didnt go ahead with the second tomato cropGanesh PinglayVashi-based wholesale dealer"

Our two-inch tongue rules our six-feet body. And the stomach takes on the role of a garbage bag, says the restaurateur. While Shettys two aforementioned eateries have been the go-to place for greasy dosas and cheesy pizzas, his new mission is to change the way we eat with his latest offering: Aharveda, located inside Golden Chariot.Aharveda has been decorated in warm shades of yellow with verses from the Gita and vedas painted on the wall and copper chandeliers above each table. The server welcomes us with a Red Roar (Rs 150) drink comprising carrot, beetroot, tomato, mint, betel leaves, coriander and gooseberries. Served at room temperature, the taste is of a Bloody Mary without the alcohol, we joke.Shetty, who started Aharveda, a food science company that conducts sessions of the importance of healthy eating, and using food to treat imbalances, shares an anecdote. We have gone to the moon, in the bargain we have lost our own powers. We understand everything other than ourselves. Picture this, theres a water tank with a faulty hole through which dirty water seeps in. This water goes to all the houses in the building. Every family, sends the sample for checking, pumps it with pesticide and insecticide to clean the water and uses it for consumption. Wouldnt it be wiser if we repaired that hole? says Shetty, who has created recipes that are an extension of his philosophy.Ahar means food in Sanskrit and it is really our medicine shop, says Shetty, offering us a cream of mushroom soup thats light on the palate, but not on flavours. Garnished with mushroom slices and a drizzle of coconut milk, we dont miss the usual onion, garlic or cream. The surprise is the pizza, with its crisp base of tapioca flour and a cheesy topping of cashew nut dust. It has everything and more a vegetarian pizza would have  olives, tomato paste and capsicums. Our eyebrows remain raised as we dig into the Mexican platter (Rs 350) of tacos, made with rajgira seeds and corn, and nachos served with a spicy salsa, guacamole, and a walnut and cashew nut sauce that replaces cheese.The Ahar Veda thali served on silverware has rice rotis, a roasted potato and corn cutlet, besan chura, rasam, cauliflower sabzi and sukka suran (elephant yam) and a serving of kheer. The offering is complete with pickled carrots (dried in-house by Shettys team and made in small batches so it doesnt need oil). The chaas (Rs 90) made from coconut milk is frothy and creamy.Shettys diversion into healthycooking began 10 years ago, when the teetotaller and non-smoker went to the doctor gasping for breath. All my parameters were abnormal, I had high blood pressure, uric acid, blood pressure, diabetes. What does health mean, I asked myself? recalls Shetty, who went on to study naturopathy. I am a second-generation restaurateur and I started working in the kitchen when I was in the seventh standard. So, I understand human emotions when it comes to food. I want my customers to believe that they can counter imbalances by choosing the right food, he asserts.If you head out to Aharveda, do remember, that their last order is at 8 p.m., as according to naturopathy rules, you shouldnt be eating later than that.Aharveda , Andheri West; 40722211/40722212"

Bullied by the Dragon on the east, who constantly threatens war on the flimsiest of grounds. Pestered by the eternal enemy to the west, who is emboldened by the support it receives from the Dragon as well as by its impending victory in Afghanistan.India has a friend in Israel. Other than that, it really doesnt have a friend in the world. But Israel has its own constraints. It is too small. It makes great arms, but of the bits-and-pieces kind. Befriending Israel has allowed India to get on the right side of the influential American Jewish community.And we should close our market to American goods unless and until Trump sees sense on the H-1B front. Enough of flaky diplomacy. Its time for realpolitik. Enough of having had our eyes glaze over by the allure of America. Russia may not be nearly as cool, but it will come to our aid in times of crisis like America never will.But Americas Jews have been unable to prevent America from dumping Israel for Iran. Israel became livid with Obama. But Trump is honouring the Iran deal. And then Israel craves recognition from its enemies, many Muslim nations. Already the Saudis are buddies with Israel. What happens if they recognize Israel, and then Pakistan follows suit?In any case, Israel is too small, too besieged, too far away from India to come to our aid in any substantive fashion in case of a conflict with the Dragon.If the conflict with the Dragon explodes into anything more than a mere skirmish, expect the eternal enemy to jump into the fray. Pakistans media is eerily silent on the friction between us and the Dragon. Now that the generals are fully in charge of the country, they are not going to sit idle in opening a second front. It would represent a dream opportunity for them.So what should we do? Just follow what the expert of realpolitik, Indira Gandhi, did. Kiss and make up with the Russians. Boris Yeltsin admittedly was openly derisive of India. That made Messrs. Rao, Vajpayee, and Manmohan, turn by turn, spurn the Russians for the allure of the US.But what has true friendship with the US got us? Empty platitudes such as natural allies, strategic partners, and little else. Sure we got the nuclear deal, but the Americans, just because their own reactors are defunct and outdated, keep pushing more and more liability down our throats.Trump came to power promising to curb H-1Bs and launch a trade war with China. He has done none of the latter, but has gone after H-1Bs with full force. H-1Bs constitute our major export to the US. Today we have Heinz tomato sauce instead of the earlier-perfectly delicious Kisan, Lays potato chips instead of Indian versions, and Coca Cola and Pepsi instead of Thums Up and Campa Cola.American goods have flooded India, and keep flooding in more and more. India has an upper middle and elite class of 150 million which can afford anything that the 100 million American middle and upper class can. America is saturated as a market. India represents a new America to the Americans. Thats why they drool all over us with idle lip-service.America has not got us what we want  a UN permanent seat. Nor have the British and the French. Yet we keep buying major arms and goods from them. We should close our markets to them unless and until they get us the UN seat. Even so, they will not come to our aid in case of conflict with our neighbours.Thats where Vladimir Putin and Indira Gandhi come in. Putin has been cold to India. He is miffed at us for abandoning him for the West. But Leonid Brezhnev was no easy customer. And Indira was able to bear hug him to save us from the Americans.Our first port of call for any major arms supply should be the Russians. We should consider signing a treaty of friendship and eternal cooperation with them just as Indira did. The effect on the Chinese will be immediatethey will back off. We should buy arms from the West only if the Russians cannot supply them to us.And we should close our market to American goods unless and until Trump sees sense on the H-1B front. Enough of flaky diplomacy. Its time for realpolitik. Enough of having had our eyes glaze over by the allure of America. Russia made not be nearly as cool, but it will come to our aid in times of crisis like America never will.Lets just do what Indira did in 1971 and made India proud of her. By doing so, we will make her proud of us."
5a0b57fb9855b76bf13ce67f,Maximum support  maximum price,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/maximum-support-maximum-price/article19281962.ece,2017-07-15,"Under the onion skin:The journey shows one thing  that farming, which sustains more than half of Indias population even if many of them also do other things on the side for supplementary income, is not a lucrative proposition. (Above and three-column image below) Pictures show the Sardar wholesale agricultural market, in Surat, Gujarat.R.V. MoorthyR_V_MoorthyIt is past noon and the Sardar wholesale agricultural market in Surat is bustling with activity. Trucks drive in every minute and so do lorries smaller in size. Farmers arrive in these with loads of agricultural produce to sell. The place has multiple rows of platforms interspersed with streets and parking spots. Each platform is dedicated to different kinds of produce: onion, fruits, vegetables, etc. Things move with clockwork precision. Daily-wage labourers offload the sacks of farm produce from trucks, dumping them in huge heaps on the floor of the platforms. A different set of merchants buys this grain and transports it from here, to be sold in towns nearby. The merchants registered here who act as conduits for the sale take a 6% commission on the produce sold. The rest goes to the farmer, and is delivered in cash on the second or fourth day.This correspondent  who accompanied the ongoing yatra of farmers organisations from Madhya Pradesh to Delhi through parts of Maharashtra and Gujarat  took a detour to talk to people at this wholesale market to make sense of agricultural marketing operations.Ebb and flow of pricesThe place is a market seeing daily fluctuations of prices, based on demand and supply. If a greater quantity of a crop comes to the market on a given day and fewer merchants land up to buy it, the price falls. If more merchants come and there is dearth of a commodity, the price rises. Farmers benefit from a higher price and return disappointed if the prices are low. The prices fluctuate even within a day. To sell for a good price is like being lucky in a draw of lots.Rakesh Bhambre and Sunil Sonone, who have driven down in a rented truck from Daswel village of the Baglan taluka in Nashik district of Maharashtra, have had a hectic day. They arrived here at 2 a.m. Through the morning, they have sold their onions, which were harvested in April, and have managed to get a price of Rs. 6-7 per kg, which is not bad. They will now head back to their village in a bit. The merchant will send them the money for their produce in cash two days from now, which another truck coming from their village will deliver to them.The two Nashik farmers say they engage only in farming and have no side work to do. Their annual calendar is hectic. In June/July and October, they sow sugar cane, which requires a lot of water and takes close to nine months to be ready. This year isnt a good one for sugar cane, they fear, as it isnt raining yet. They sow onion in August and also in November. They have brought the harvest of their November crop of onion here, they say. The advantage with onion is that it can also be stored for four-five months.They also sow tomato in June and July, and the crop takes two months to be ready.The agricultural process requires a variety of expenses. They need to buy seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and machines on hire for harvesting. They have to pay the bills for power consumed while watering their fields. They also need to hire labour for various operations, from preparing the fields, taking care of the crop to loading the produce on to trucks. Labour charges range from Rs. 70-100 a day.These expenses  varying for different crops  are facilitated both by the money they get by selling their previous produce in the market and by borrowing from cooperative banks, nationalised banks and regional rural banks at an interest of around 7%. Sometimes, they have to borrow from private merchants too, at a higher rate of interest on a monthly basis. Most farmers are under debt of a few lakhs, and sometimes borrow from one lender to pay another. A good crop and remunerative prices  a matter of chance  can lead to better incomes. A slump in prices of a crop or erratic monsoon can lead to loss.The variegated world of farmersThis year, farmers in Nimaad region of Madhya Pradesh and in adjoining parts of Maharashtra  like Nashik and Ahmednagar  are still awaiting rains. If it does not rain for another week, they say, their crops will be damaged. Villages, of course, have farmers of varying means. The richer ones have more land  perhaps 20 acres  and can try three or four kinds of crops in their fields. If one fails, they believe the other will not. The smaller farmers find it harder to get by.The truck in which Bhambre and Sonone brought their produce to Surat has been hired from a bigger farmer of their village, who owns trucks and hires them out.These two farmers  each owning 7-8 acres of land  however spend the year in farming, both with their family labour and hired daily wagers. The poorest in villages own no land of their own, and work on the fields of others.The wealthier farmers have also diversified into related occupations and other businesses as an additional cushion, as farming is not very lucrative and yields and prices are unpredictable. The poorest in the agricultural world either work others fields or do additional work as rickshaw pullers, construction workers, etc., sometimes becoming poor migrants. Hours before reaching the Surat market, this correspondent visited Koribhartna village near Surat, where daily wagers were working the fields of a richer farmer where okra was being grown. Dinesh, a daily-wage labourer of the village with no land of his own, said he works through the year at a daily wage of Rs. 100. He gets one or the other agricultural work through the year, he says, but adds that the money he earns is not enough for maintaining his family well.Pandane village in Nashik district is situated close to a dam from where it gets what villagers complain is sand-laced water. Pradip Shivaji Chitte, whose joint family has 7.5-acres of land, of which he works on just 2.5, has opened a small shop dealing in seeds, fertilisers and pesticides. He rented this shop two months ago in a bid to diversify beyond farming. I invested Rs. 1 lakh in this; some of my friends also contributed, he says. But till now, I am just being able to break even. Chitte says he is under Rs. 16-lakh debt and practises grape farming in the village. In our village, half the farming is grape farming; the rest is of all other crops, he says.Just preparing the fields for the crops entails a labour charge of Rs. 20,000 per acre, he claims. The fields are prepared from September and the harvest comes only by January, before which the crop requires a lot of care. The total expense, including labour, fertilisers and pesticides, comes to Rs. 1.6-1.7 lakh per acre. The selling of the produce begins from January and it sells at about Rs. 18-25 per kg. If one subtracts the expense borne from the selling price per acre, the profit is Rs. 45,000-50,000. This is the annual income for growing grapes per acre. Chitte says bigger farmers aiming at exports prepare their fields a month earlier  they also get higher prices when they sell their produce, he adds.Farmers in the Nimaad region of Madhya Pradesh also grow hybrid crops like Bt cotton.The same is the case in neighbouring districts of Maharashtra like Nashik. Jagdish Patidar, who came to Barwani for a day from Maheshwar in Madhya Pradesh to take part in the ongoing rally of farmers organisations, says he too grows Bt cotton, which requires more supply of water and higher input costs. What they look for is higher prices for their produce.Bt cotton costs more but is high yield and therefore more lucrative for farmers. When a new variety that is advertised as high yield comes, farmers will take to it for profits, says Lakhwinder Singh, an agriculture expert at Punjabi University, Patiala. Many farmers also took to it as it was advertised as resistant to bollworm, a pest that affected cotton. However, Singh cautions, the pest resistance is only for three-four years.Agitations and farmers yatraThe ongoing farmers agitations are demanding state support for making farming more lucrative. They demand that the M.S. Swaminathan Committees recommendation  that the government-announced minimum support price (MSP) should be 1.5-times the cost of production  be implemented. They are also demanding farm loan waiver, as many farmers are under large debt. However, a loan waiver does not ease the burden of loans taken from private parties.Till July 14, a Kisan Mukti Yatra involving several farmers organisations has been moving through Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, addressing villagers and articulating these demands. The participants argue that while input costs for farming have been rising, the rise in MSP has been sluggish.Swaraj Abhiyan leader and academic Yogendra Yadav, Narmada Bachao Andolan leader Medha Patkar, Maharashtra farmer leader Raju Shetti, the All India Kisan Sabha, Kisan Sangharsh Morcha, Bhartiya Kisan Union of Punjab, and other organisations are taking part in the yatra, which will converge on Jantar Mantar in Delhi on July 18. It began in Madhya Pradesh, with the farmers leaders being detained for a few hours by the police, and passed through Indore, Barwani  visiting village Barda, which is in the submergence zone of the Sardar Sarovar dam  Nashik, Vyara and Surat in Gujarat, Bhilwara and Jaipur in Rajasthan, among other places. There are regular halts to interact with people, with crowds varying from a few hundred to a few thousand turning up.The yatra comes close on the heels of the deaths of six farmers in police action in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, and a strike by Maharashtra farmers early in June, when they decided to let their farm produce and milk perish but not sell it in the absence of lucrative prices. The strike was broken in 48 hours after talks with the Maharashtra government, which made a few announcements: loan waivers for small and debt-ridden farmers; a Bill to criminalise buying produce at rates below the MSP; the setting up of a State Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices on the lines of the Centre to look into MSP issues. The State government also offered to subsidise farmers power bills, hike milk prices and set up cold storage chains for preserving the produce.Making farming sustainableThe journey shows one thing  that farming, which sustains more than half of Indias population even if many of them also do other things on the side for supplementary income, is not a lucrative proposition. Farmlands have become smaller over generations and, except for large farmers, many do not find it rewarding but find themselves ill-trained for other occupations, says Patidar, the farmer from Maheshwar. Farmers, however, do have an emotional attachment to farming.Their fortunes depend on many things: rains, prevailing prices, and how indebted they become. Lakhwinder Singh says that the answer to the agrarian unease is either subsidies on input costs or higher prices. He says farmers need to spend not just on farming but also on services like education and health. Unless their expenses go down or incomes go up, discontent is expected, he adds. Everything from health and education to seeds that were public services once are private services now. Farmers get into this loop of rising costs of living, he explains.In Punjab, the government purchases all wheat and rice crops at the MSP. This, being scientifically calculated, can enable farmers to have some incomes that make agriculture meaningful. But the same procurement guarantee applies neither to all crops nor to all States, which makes farming less lucrative as an occupation, says Lakhwinder Singh.Farmers in Madhya Pradesh say that government procurement centres are opened late, often a month and a half after a crop is ready. But farmers cannot store it all in their fields near their homes. They try to sell their crop soon after harvest to merchants, and often get prices below the MSP. If government centres were to start as soon as the harvest came, we would get better prices, says Patidar.The troubles dont end here. Patidar says not all the produce is bought by these centres; it may be rejected on grounds of quality. Suraj, a young farmer from Naraula village in Barwani district, says that there is much paperwork in these centres to ascertain the quantity of land on which the crop was sown, the yield, and to verify that the produce indeed belongs to the farmer who brought it.Unless there is a procurement guarantee and the farmer can count on the government to purchase his produce, the MSP has little meaning on the ground, says former Maharashtra State Planning Commission member and economist H.M. Desarda. Lakhwinder Singh adds that if the government undertakes to purchase all major crops at the MSP, farmers will be better off.But will this not push prices of farm produce bought by consumers upward? Lakhwinder Singh disagrees. He says the large number of middlemen in the supply chain do not anyway let vegetable and grain prices reflect the prices at which farmers are selling them. The long-term answer to farmers indebtedness, he adds, is a rise in their incomes.It may become a heated debate politically, but an answer to non-remunerative farming may take longer to come.Unless there is a procurement guarantee and the farmer can count on the government to purchase his produce, the MSP has little meaning on the ground,H.M.

The Centres role was limited to linking spot market to future market, reforms in essential commodities Act and bolstering food storage and processing sectors.When tomato was being sold at Rs. 7 a kg in A.P., it was sold at Rs. 50 a kg in Kerala the same day. Why are our State markets not integrated. Why cant we have better shelf life for vegetables and fruits. We need to remove restrictions on agriculture market and invite competition between markets, he said.Dr. Chand said a good number of SDGs were directly related to agriculture such as reducing poverty, zero hunger and sustainable use of water.While a new State would tend to grow faster and Telangana apparently was on the right track, it should quickly learn from mistakes of the other States which compromised long-term goals in favour of the short-term ones.He said over-exploitation of water and excessive use of chemical fertilizers would be the pinching factors. Our crop patterns should be linked to water availability. The States should look at different zones and decide on crops that are suitable to specific zones, he said.On decreasing income of farmers, he said though the income might not have risen in 2014-15 and 2015-16, the long-term data showed that the income accruing to the farmers was rising at three % a year. But that was not enough to meet the growing needs and aspirations for better education and health when the rest of the economy was growing at seven to eight %.Unless the farmers income was supplemented by non-farm sources, the agrarian distress would not be alleviated, he said."

And most of the crop, apparently, is withering away though the government says crop in only 7,300 acres is under stress.According to official figures, more than 3.4 lakh farmers seem to have left agriculture for good while the quantum of seed distributed has gone down by over 50%  3.44 lakh quintals  to todays 3.32 lakh quintals.From a high of 5.69 lakh quintals being distributed and 6.32 lakh farmers benefiting in 2009, it went to a low of just over 1.24 lakh quintals and 1.39 lakh farmers in 2014.After slowly regaining some ground in 2015 and 2016, backed by the governments promise of farm loan waiver and the ambitious promise of driving away drought by ensuring a successful crop in every acre through a combination of farm ponds and rain guns, the numbers have started to dwindle again.From the dismal lows of 2014, seed distribution rose by 73.98% (year on year) and the number of beneficiaries by 71.75% in 2015. The next year too registered a 43.6% and 37.5% increase in the quantum of seed distributed and beneficiaries respectively.However, it fell to a 7.1% growth (year on year over 2016) to 3.32 lakh quintals seed distributed and registered a negative growth rate of 17.72% in the number of beneficiaries this year.Given the fact that the acreage of alternative crops  castor, cotton and others including that of perennial crops (mostly horticulture) hasnt crossed the 70,000-hectare mark in any of the past years, it can safely be assumed that well over at least five lakh farmers are not taking to agriculture at all and around five lakh hectares are being left fallow for the better part of the last decade.I have left 15 of my 19 acres fallow this year out. Last year, I cultivated groundnut in the entire area and faced utter failure and debts. So, I shifted to tomato in four acres as it too has fluctuating fortunes at best, said Pulla Reddy, a farmer from the Anantapur rural mandal.Several lakhs of farmers seem to have made similar choices. The rise in the migration of people every year is but mirroring the grave crisis in the agrarian sector.Several farmers are choosing to move away from agriculture as it has become an experiment year after year. Confidence needs to be instilled in the farmers by bringing water for irrigation usage is the only answer, Peddireddy of the Andhra Pradesh Rythu Sangham told The Hindu ."

5a0b5e999855b76bf13ceb0f,Taming inflationary expectations,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/taming-inflationary-expectations/article19338912.ece,2017-07-24,"The official inflation rate dipped to 1.5% last month, the lowest in almost two decades. Inflation is a politically more sensitive challenge than joblessness for the simple reason that it affects everyone, whether you have a job or not.Indias long-term record in managing inflation has been very impressive when compared with most developing countries. We have never had the bouts of hyperinflation experienced in many Latin American economies or seen even in countries such as Israel. The relatively high double-digit inflation experienced between 2010 to 2013 was an aberration, which had a political consequence. There have been very few instances of such persistent, multi-year, high inflationary episodes in our history. The credit for this goes to the vigilance of the political system and also to effective monetary management. Inflation is after all a monetary phenomenon  more money chasing fewer goods. So, controlling money supply is part of the strategy for controlling inflation.Food prices as indicatorBut inflation is also an indicator of whether there is an excess demand or supply of goods. For instance, with a bumper crop of fruits and vegetables, prices plunge, even though money supply might be unchanged. Indeed, the recent drop in the inflation rate has been caused by a steep fall in the prices of vegetables (-17%) and pulses (- 22%). Conversely, and rather ironically, unseasonal rains in the north have destroyed a large part of the tomato crop causing prices to skyrocket. Food prices, especially of perishables, are notoriously volatile. High onion prices, even if temporary, have caused the downfall of governments in past elections. Food prices are a big component in the determinant of the overall inflation rate based on the consumer price index basket. Keeping them low and stable involves policies such as public procurement and a minimum support price regime. Inflation control thus involves a combination of monetary management along with measures to increase supply of goods (in the medium term) as also anti-hoarding measures or the release of stocks from government warehouses.Even though price stability is an important goal of government policy, it is now an exclusive mandate given to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Last year, in a landmark reform of monetary management, the government officially gave an inflation target to the RBI. Prior to this, the central bank had multiple objectives which included enhancing growth and reducing unemployment, although price stability was undoubtedly paramount. The new paradigm, called the flexible inflation targeting framework, aims for a numerical target given by the government. The main tool to achieve it is by setting the benchmark interest rate. This decision is now taken by the six-member monetary policy committee (MPC), chaired by the Governor. The current inflation target is 4% plus or minus 2%. The MPC is deemed to have failed if for three consecutive quarters the inflation rate falls outside the band.Low inflation pointerWho would have imagined that in the new MPC regime, the first instance of deviation of the inflation rate would undershoot, not overshoot the target? Of course, technically, the MPC has not failed, for the June inflation rate of 1.5%, which is below 2%, may be transitory. However, there are strong indications and forecasts by many economists that point to low inflation in the coming months. Those numbers may be in the range of 2 to 4%.How did we get to this low inflation scenario? Partly it must be because the money supply has been kept dear, or tight. Thus, the benchmark rate (called the repo rate, or the rate at which the RBI gives money to banks) at 6.25% may be too high. Interest rates are the price of money, so if they are too high, money becomes scarce. If it is lowered, then there will be more money in circulation, more loans given out. But low inflation is also because of a steep fall in prices of fruits, vegetables and pulses, none of which was caused by high interest rates. These steep falls are highly seasonal. We have also benefited from low and stable crude oil prices, which are a crucial determinant of transport and energy costs.All eyes will now be on the MPC which meets again in less than two weeks. There is a strong feeling that high interest rates have deterred big industrial investments, or housing finance. High rates are crippling borrowers who try to come out of near-bankruptcy and are preventing a restructuring of stressed bank loans. Indias real interest rates, i.e. net of inflation, are quite high even compared to other developing countries. Much of the developed world has ultra-low rates, with some countries such as Sweden, Switzerland and Japan even having negative interest rates. India needs much lower rates for higher GDP growth.But the job of the MPC wont be easy. This is mainly because its task is to target future inflation, not the past. The future has some troubling portents. The short run impact of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is bound to be inflationary. Thats because a bulk of Indias GDP is in services whose tax rate has moved from 15% to 18%. Besides, while sellers wait for their refund, i.e. input tax credit under the GST, their cost of capital locked up might go up. Many State governments have introduced additional levies to counter their apprehension of a loss of revenue under the GST. Besides the GST, there is the impact of the award of the Seventh Pay Commission to government employees. This effect will cascade to public sector organisations and State-level employees as well, and put pressure on prices. A third factor could be the loan waivers announced in some States which can cause fiscal stress. High deficit spending is not compatible with lower interest rates. A fourth factor is the uptick in commodity prices worldwide as metals and food prices are looking up.The last, and probably the most important, factor weighing on the MPCs mind would be inflation expectations. Household surveys conducted by the RBI indicate that people are expecting inflation to be close to 10% , not the 1.5% as is reported now. You may say that these expectations are irrational, but they do affect behaviour. In this season of salary increments, try giving someone a raise of 2%, as is common in the developed world. Workers will howl. Even their official dearness allowance is much higher. The real challenge is to slay this inflation expectations monster. In much of the western world, they are fighting disinflation if not outright deflation. But in India we are still struggling with inflationary conditions and expectations.In English the verb for inflation is inflate. It refers to rising prices. But in most Indian languages, the equivalent word in usage is  mehengaai , which refers to affordability and cost of living. Not all inflation is unwelcome. So if stock prices go up, that is good cheer. But  mehengaai  is hated by all. A low and stable inflation rate is a perquisite for sustained high economic growth. Mehengaai is antithetical to it. In the medium term, the growth impact of the GST, the improving ease of doing business  and hence increasing supply of goods  and a strong domestic currency, will all help keep inflation low. But the short run challenge is to temper inflationary expectations and keep them tethered.Ajit Ranade is an economist"

But their efforts fell through as they could not get credit without providing non-agricultural assets as collateral guarantee, pointed out Executive Director G.V. Ramanjaneyulu of Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (CSA).The 30% tax on farmers cooperative societies was a big dampener and just like the IT sector, there should be a tax holiday for farmers cooperative societies to get them into the market system, he suggested, at a recent workshop on Bangaru Telangana and Sustainable Development Goals attended by government officials and agriculture experts.While the proposed Rs. 4,000 financial assistance per acre to be extended to farmers by the Telangana government was welcome, it would do well to adopt Karnatakas model of having a State-level price mechanism to compensate farmers if prices fell below the floor price. Meagre farm incomes as against rising cost of living, lack of support systems for credit access or for marketing the produce, high cost of production and no commensurate support prices have resulted in growing debt burden and farmers suicides, observed Dr. Ramanjaneyulu.The government, which brought out agricultural action plans, should also be submitting review reports and data related to how many farmers got the credit and minimum support price etc., should be kept in the public domain. And, when prices of vegetables like tomato suffer wide variations from Rs. 1 a kg to Rs. 100 a kg, States should not brook delay in pushing for one country, one market to benefit both farmers and consumers.Farmers have been cultivating only three to four main crop varieties across all areas increasing the risk factor as all areas would not be suitable for all crops, therefore cropping pattern changes has to be crucial. For instance, cotton being cultivated in 40 lakh acres this season could be a risky proposition. Same goes with paddy, a water intensive crop, he says.Dr. Ramanjeyalu also alludes to the fact that TS accounted for the highest fertiliser consumption in the country which means the farmers cost of production has only increased even as the soil health took a hit."

Today, thanks to less production and greater demand, the average rate is Rs 80 a kilo and even an unprecedented Rs 100 is not unheard of.""While there are tomato varieties of lower quality which cost around Rs 80 in the local markets, the best ones are being sold even at Rs 110 per kg,"" says S Siraj Ahmed, a vegetable merchant in Russell Market.The reasons for the spike in prices are not hard to find at the Agricultural Produce and Marketing Committee (APMC) premises at Kolar headquarters, Asia's second largest tomato market. Traders and APMC officials at the yard and farmers in the surrounding villages agree that a combination of a dip in tomato production this season and a sudden rise in the demand for Kolar tomatoes from other states has led to rocketing prices.Kolar APMC secretary T S Ravi Kumar said tomato production in the region had gradually gone down in the past few months due to various reasons  less rain, low pricing and increased temperatures which decreases the yield. ""The supply we receive at the APMC during this season has gone down by 50% compared with last year. At this juncture, the demand for stocks has also gone up from some of the north Indian states where the production has come to a standstill due to flooding and other reasons. As the stocks have become limited, the price of tomatoes has gone up,"" he said.""The price is expected to remain the same or go up further till local production in other states picks up,"" said Toheed Pasha, a trader.Located around 70km from Bengaluru, Kolar headquarters is next only to the tomato market in Maharashtra's Nashik. Apart from Bengaluru, which receives a good chunk of tomatoes from here, the stocks are sold regularly to parts of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and some north Indian states as well. Traders also take tomato loads from here and supply to Bangladesh and Pakistan, among other countries.Kolar a tomato hotspotSrikanth C R from CMR Mandi (primary assembly market) at the Kolar APMC said the best of tomatoes land here from the various taluks in Kolar as well as from surrounding districts like Chikkaballapura, Bengaluru Rural, Mandya, Tumakuru and Chitradurga. ""By good quality, we mean uniform size, required hardness, shining and original red colour in the yield. This is the reason why traders from different parts of the country prefer tomatoes from here. Farmers from neighbouring Ananthpur and Chittoor districts of Andhra Pradesh come here to sell tomatoes as they can get a good number of traders,"" he said."

An Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) official told TOI that demand for French beans dips in the rainy season."" Because of that, supplies to the markets also come down. Excessive rains tend to affect some crops adversely,"" he said.Yakub Pathan, owner of the Fresh Vegetable Market in Wakad, said French bean prices have been on an upswing for about a month now.""Before Friday, French beans were sold at Rs60 per kg in the retail market. On Friday however, the price doubled, to Rs120 per kg. On Friday, the wholesale markets had no supply of French Beans, which caused the prices to rise,"" Pathan said of the situation.Tomatoes too are being sold between Rs80 and Rs100 in most retail markets. Kailash Kolhe, a vegetable vendor in Koregaon Park, said, ""We buy tomatoes from wholesalers at Rs70 per kg, and sell them at Rs80 per kg. Intense rain spells in tomato growing regions is ruining the crop, apart from making the harvested tomatoes pale in colour,"" Kolhe said. With 50% less supply of tomatoes in the market, the cost of tomatoes has continued to spiral upwards in the last few weeks. With less availability of tomatoes, the prices will continue to remain this way, stated sources from APMC.However, improved production is supposed to bring down tomato prices from mid-August and September.According to sources in the market, during last month's farmers' strike, many tillers had destroyed their standing crop as they were not sure how long the strike would go on for. Incessant rains too played spoilsport, bringing down production. However, the APMC hopes that things would improve and markets would normalize by August.Dilip Khire of Pune APMC added that incessant rains had damaged tomato crops and supply from farmers had depleted, which had caused the prices to rise over the last two months. Gadhve said that Narayangaon, which is one of the largest tomato suppliers, was seeing only 25% supply in the last two months.""There are about 70-80 villages in Narayangaon that supply tomatoes. With less production, we are only getting 200 metric tonne instead of 800 metric tonne of tomatoes during the same period last year,"" he said. He further added that the tomatoes coming from North India, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka have reduced.Meanwhile, vegetable vendor Nanasaheb Awate from NIBM Road said that since the wholesale prices of tomatoes had gone up, he can no longer afford to buy it, and so stopped stocking the vegetable at his stall.""The prices of all vegetables increased during the monsoon and tomatoes are practically impossible to get. For the last three days, my vegetable vendor has not been keeping tomatoes at his stall, so I've not been able to buy,"" said working professional Nina Shah."

That is a clear acknowledgement that their occupation of the said sheds is illegal. Despite that, no action has been taken against them till now,"" said Kriplani. ""We want our sheds back and want action against officials who have colluded with the encroachers. Unless the encroachment is removed, we will continue with our strike on Friday.""Minister Rai said that he met representatives of both camps on Tuesday and the best solution that he had for this problem was to reallocate the sheds. ""If one camp is claiming that the other has occupied sheds illegally, then this is how sheds have been occupied in the mandi for years. I have spoken to officials as well and now the allotment will be on the basis on payment of market fees. Space will be allocated in proportion to market fees paid. The same exercise had to be carried out with the potato and onion traders as well,"" he added."

During a meeting with development minister Gopal Rai, traders were assured that the alleged illegal occupation of tomato sheds would be removed. But, at the same time the government also made it clear that they would continue with the reallocation of sheds.""Our basic problem was that some tomato sheds had been occupied illegally. Despite a show cause notice to the encroachers by the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee, they had not been removed. On Tuesday, the minister assured us that the encroachments will be removed while subsequent reallocation will also be done. The traders were satisfied with the outcome of the meeting and called off the strike,"" said Metha Ram Kriplani, a trader.The government also accepted the demand of some traders that they pay market fees by cheque as they were unable to understand the e-banking process started recently. Traders had gone on strike on Monday and suspended their agitation for a day to attend the meeting with Rai on Tuesday. Officials said the day-long strike resulted in a loss of about Rs 30-40 crore as Azadpur is the biggest wholesale fruit and vegetable market in Asia."

S. Mekhala, who runs Eco Organic, a gardening consultancy firm.In a bid to get more people hooked to kitchen and terrace gardening, she has joined hands with Uzhavar Sandhai at Chokkikulam here and is selling seed packets for Rs. 10 each until August 3. Vermicompost and coir pith are also on sale.D. Gunasekaran, Agriculture and Administrative Officer of the farmers market, says not many city people are aware of the advantages of having their own garden. Gardening is a step towards self-sustenance for those with a green thumb. One can save money as well in the process, as fluctuating prices in the market will not affect them. The bonus is one gets to eat nutritious food. A minor hitch is that one has to deal with rare air-borne diseases that affect plants, he says. Ms. Mekhala says seeds of tomato and green vegetables sell well.T. Aparna, who has raised a small terrace garden at her home, says more such initiatives should be taken so that people are also educated about environmental issues such as global warming. Mr. Gunasekaran says gardening is good for relieving stress and calming the mind. If people give 15 to 20 minutes of their free time every day in tending to their garden, they will reap a yield in four to five weeks, he says."

""The Biju Mahila Janata Dal (BJD's women's wing) will stage protest in all district headquarters against the anti-woman move,"" he said. Pramila Mullick, the BJD women's wing president, said the government undertook publicity campaigns to ensure that maximum women use LPG leaving behind firewood. When it became a habit for them, the government now is suddenly withdrawing the benefits so that the oil companies can make money. ""There can't be a worse form of deceit by the government,"" she said. ""We will announce dates of our agitation on Wednesday,"" she said.The BJD members on Tuesday joined the opposition in the protest against the LPG price hike move in Rajya Sabha. BJP spokesperson Sajjan Sharma said the BJD is trying to make political capital against Dharmendra though the Centre's decision will not affect any poor and deserving family. ""Only the rich people who are getting undue benefits of subsidy, like the MLAs, MPs and bureaucrats will have to pay the actual price.""Political insiders feel the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), the subsidized cooking gas scheme for economically weaker sections, is a major reason why the saffron party has been able to made inroads into newer territories at the grassroots. Now, the decision to withdraw subsidizes from the middle class may boomerang, they feel. ""It may become a setback to the momentum gained by the saffron party in Odisha after its impressive performance in the panchayat election in February,"" an analyst said.For the BJD, the move comes as a godsend political weapon. ""It will help bring Dharmendra to a spot of bother at a time when there is constant media scrutiny of BJD's poll expenditure,"" he added.The Samajwadi Party state unit said the Centre's move to hike domestic LPG cylinder price by Rs 4 a month is contrary to the Centre's slogan of 'clean energy and healthy life of women'. ""As such price of vegetables, tomato and onion is beyond the reach of the common consumer. Cooking gas price hike will further burden him,"" he said."

However, retailers in Khar, Andheri, Matunga and Malad are still charging upwards of Rs 90-100.""The prices have fallen but it is still burning a hole in our our pockets. We restrict ourselves to quarter kg or half kg. Quarter kg barely lasts a day. So there is no reason to be pleased. The normal cost of this essential item is Rs 16-20 per kg, and until that rate is achieved, Mumbaikars will not be happy,"" said Mulund resident Sharad Shewle.In Navi Mumbai's Mafco market, the biggest retail market near APMC, tomatoes were sold at Rs 60 per kg on Tuesday, which brought some respite for consumers. Traders are anticipating further de-escalation in prices in the coming days as new harvest is expected to hit the market. ""Supply has increased by 15% in the last few days, bringing down the prices,"" said APMC sources.""There is a slight respite from the rising tomato prices. We hope it will dip further to stabilize our already disturbed monthly kitchen budget. Meanwhile, we have reduced consumption of tomatoes due to the astronomical prices,"" said Airoli resident Neelam Patil. In Thane's Talavpali main vegetable market and Gaodevi retail market, a kilo of Tomatoes was being sold for around Rs 65-70 per kg, on Tuesday.
