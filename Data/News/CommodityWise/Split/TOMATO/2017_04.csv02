All the girls were rushed to the area hospital for treatment. Three girls were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the hospital as their condition was serious. All the students are said to be stable now.The girls who consumed hostel food in the evening started vomiting around midnight and they were immediately shifted in 108 ambulances to area hospital by the hostel authorities. It is learnt that they reportedly consumed potato and tomato curry with rice for dinner in the hostel mess after which they began to show signs of uneasiness.Parents of the girls, who reached the hospital after learning about the incident, alleged that the students had been complaining about the hostel mess' poor quality of food for a long time but the management ignored their complaints.According to sources, the students of the gurukul are not happy with the hostel mess food and in the past too such incidents have taken place, but of a lesser magnitude, and the matter was kept a secret. Students told reporters that though they have been complaining about the poor quality of food to the school principal, no action was taken to improve the quality.""Worms are found in the food often. We complained about it to the principal many times but he did nothing. The cook always makes unhygienic food,"" a student said.Though the students were rushed to the area hospital for treatment there were not enough doctors to attend them. The hospital superintendent had to request Bayyaram government hospital doctors to rush immediately to help them in treating the girls.Local MLA Shankar Naik, who rushed to hospital after learning about the incident, fumed at hospital authorities as doctors were not available to treat the girls. Joint collector and DEO, who also reached the hospital to take stock of the situation, expressed displeasure over the way the hospital was functioning. They pulled up the hospital superintendent for non-availability of doctors in the hospital during night hours.Deputy chief minister Kadiyam Srihari, who also holds education minister's portfolio, expressed anger over the incident and directed his department officials to immediately cancel the contract of the caterers. He directed district collector Preeti Meena to take steps to provide proper treatment to the girls.The deputy chief minister, who is touring Warangal rural district, also spoke to the hospital superintendent, who informed him that the condition of all the girls was stable and that they would be discharged by evening. He also directed the collector to take stringent action against the persons responsible for the incident.Meanwhile, Congress, CPI and students' union activists gathered in front of the hospital and demanded that the government take stringent action against the gurukul warden, principal and cook. They also wanted the collector to take action against the doctors for staying away from duty.The police have registered a case and are investigating. Food inspectors have collected samples consumed by the students for testing them in labs."

At Krishnagiri, the hub of tomato cultivation, bright red ones that filled expansive fields during the abundant harvest shrivelled and died in front of farmers eyes. They had no choice as the market offered just Rs 80 for a 25kg crate (Rs 3.2 per kg).Last Sunday, at the same wholesale market in Krishnagiri, the price had shot up. A 25kg crate was sold for Rs 1,600 and as it made its way through large distributors to wholesalers and finally retail traders, the price hovered around Rs100 per kg for consumers in distant cities.It is the cascading effect of the crisis that had hit farmers at the start of the year that is being felt in kitchens across the State seven months later. It was brought about by a variety of events including glut in the previous season, which was worsened by demonetisation, which led to a severe cash crunch in the market in those months. There was not enough currency available to make any purchase other than essentials.After the drastic setback in winter, many farmers simply refused to cultivate during the next cycle. Few like L Vijay from Rayakottai in Krishnagiri, who went ahead on a half-acre piece of land were hit by the water crisis. He had dug two borewells that went as deep as 1,200ft but found no water. I was forced to buy water at Rs 700 per 6,000 litres, which was used on alternate days to protect my crop.Vijay managed to get a considerable yield but that is a rare success story. Because, as he said, many farmers left without sowing seeds.The effect of this reduction in cultivation was felt in the markets across the western region immediately. At Krishnagiri market, the arrival has dipped to 10,000 crates per day against 40,000-50,000.The sharp fluctuations in price are clearly affecting farmers, markets and consumers, with none having any certainty on how the price would behave at the end of a crop cycle, even if it is only 60-70 days long.There are tomato processing units in Krishnagiri, Kinathukadavu and Tiruchy that the State government is running in association with the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU), said vice chancellor K Ramasamy.According to him, farmers did not follow the announcements that the university made, and sowed without considering the climatic condition and water availability. Such individual cultivation would not help to ensure profitable farming, he said.From this year, following a recommendation by the TNAU, the State government has decided to shift the cultivation method to seedling plantation from sowing seeds. So we hope the cultivation can be streamlined into a systematic manner under the guidance of the State horticulture department.The government is also considering another suggestion by the university on creating 10 marketing societies across the State and introducing mobile processing units to collect the excess produce from the farm itself, he added."

The current price spiral is remarkable for its suddenness.First, it was tomatoes and now it is onions, whose prices are soaring, much to the discomfort of consumers and policymakers. The current price spiral is remarkable for its suddenness. Only two months ago  that too, during peak summer  tomatoes were retailing at an all-India average of Rs 15 per kg. That rate has quadrupled since, even scaling Rs 100 briefly in some places. Even more striking is that onion, till as late as July 21, was selling below Rs 7 per kg at Lasalgaon in Maharashtra. But today it is quoting at over twice that level in the countrys biggest market for the bulb. The second point to note about the price flare-up now is that it follows a protracted period of low rates for producers. Leaving out the last 10 days or so, onions have been trading in Lasalgaon at below Rs 10/kg since February 2016. Tomato growers were similarly battling Rs 5-6/kg prices from November right through mid-June; they have hardly benefitted from present wholesale prices of Rs 40-plus.There are two reasons for prices going up. The first is the monsoon. Rainfall this time, although normal on the whole, hasnt been as good and well-distributed as in 2016. While Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and even the Marathwada and Vidarbha regions of Maharashtra are facing drought-like conditions, Gujarat and Rajasthan have borne the fury of floods. This has led to delayed plantings or even necessitated re-sowing of the kharif crop in many areas. The immediate impact is being felt in onions and tomatoes, but the effects on other crops  maize, jowar, groundnut, soyabean, cotton  cannot be ruled out. The second explanation may have to do with un-remunerative realisations, post-demonetisation, in most crops until recently. There is evidence, at least in tomatoes, of farmers cutting back on production as a result. The price of that is now being paid by consumers.Going by past record, the Centres most likely response to rising prices would be to impose restrictions on exports (not allowing shipments below a minimum price) and holding of stocks by traders/processors, alongside allowing duty-free imports or even contracting these through government agencies. We saw this in 2014, 2015 and even 2016 in respect of onions, potatoes, pulses and sugar. While being sensitive to the interests of consumers may be a good thing  and also in consonance with the Reserve Bank of Indias inflation-targeting goals  this clearly cannot be at the expense of producers. Like its predecessors, the Narendra Modi government has shown little commitment to the principles of free trade and liberalisation when it comes to agriculture. Hopefully, the promise of doubling farmers incomes by 2022 will lead it to respond differently this time round.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Tashi Tobgyal Azadpur mandi, the largest in Asia, wore a deserted look on Monday. Tashi TobgyalThe usually busy and crammed streets of Azadpur mandi wore a deserted look on Monday evening as a section of fruit and vegetable traders shut shop. Complaining of corruption in the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC, Azadpur) and encroachment of some sheds by new traders, a group of old-timers sat in protest under a tent. Tomato trader Puran Chand, 59, said, Ive been in this business for 30 years. On June 20, my area was illegally occupied by another firm Im suffering major losses. Another tomato trader, 50-year-old Tilak Raj, recounted a similar tale: I have barely bought two boxes of tomatoes since June 20 Ive told the labourers to find a job elsewhere because I have no work to give.While some of the traders organised a dharna on July 19  with a few sitting on a two-day hunger strike  many closed their sheds on Monday in protest. Stating that closing the mandi meant incurring a loss of Rs 30-40 crore daily, Anil Malhotra, general secretary of Azadpur Vegetable Traders Body, said, We demand that the sheds be given back to those who won the bid We also demand insurance for wage labourers and a proper security system, as well maintaining cleanliness in the area.He added, Initially, they (the committee) would accept cheques for market fee payments. Now we can only pay online Every trader is not well-versed with this; how can they force us? Sources in the Delhi government, meanwhile, maintained that the vegetable mandi was in fact open, while the fruit mandi was partially shut. A source said, This was a politically motivated non-strike the Delhi government will not bow down to blackmail.Reacting to accusations by the traders, Satnam Singh, secretary, APMC (Azadpur), said, The issue is of allotment This faction did not let the new allotment of sheds happen in 2016. They dont want reform, which is why theyre also against online payment of market fee. The country is moving towards digitisation but they dont want to. He added, As far as cleanliness is concerned, this is a 24X7 mandi and we do our best. The corruption charges are also baseless.While the traders have called off the strike as a meeting is scheduled with the APMC on Tuesday, they added, If our demands arent met, well shut down all four mandis of Delhi, go on a hunger strike and block Adarsh Nagar Metro station.For all the latest Delhi News, download Indian Express App"

(Photo| ANI)LUCKNOW: Pricey tomatoes today spurred a fresh round of protests by Congress workers who parked a cart full of tomatoes in front of the UP Legislative Assembly and sold the kitchen staple at Rs 10 per kg.The party had earlier come up with a ""State Bank of Tomato"" that is being operated from the Youth Congress office here.Tomato prices have hovered around Rs 100 per kg in major cities with supplies being disrupted due to heavy rains.Congress workers led by state secretary Shailendra Tiwari stood in front of the Assembly with a cart full of tomatoes with a banner ""Tamatar ke aaye acche din"" (good days have come for tomatoes) and sold it at Rs 10 per kg per person.""This is our way to protest the soaring tomato price.We are selling it to the common man to show our concern for them. It's ironical that the government has not taken any initiative to open subsidised counters for selling tomatoes or to check its price,"" Tiwari said.The 'tomato bank' has some interesting schemes to offer like providing the commodity on easy loan as also a locker facility, 80 per cent loans on tomatoes and attractive interest rates for depositing tomatoes, especially for the poor.The idea behind the bank is to lodge a protest and to create awareness among the people about the commodity being sold at such high rates.Prices of tomato have shot up about four times since the beginning of June when tomatoes were being sold at about Rs 25 per kg in the Delhi-National Capital Region market.Industry body Assocham had said recently that ""Tomato prices may not immediately ease as flooding in some of the growing states has led to damage to the crop.""Unlike onion and potato, the shelf life of tomato is very short and it needs cold chains and modern warehouses for storage and transportation, it said.Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Odisha are the major tomato growing states.The country produces around 18 million tonnes of tomatoes."

The restaurant has introduced a new menu that includes signature Italian dishes and exotic ingredients. For starters, we were served Fungi misti e Formaggi, Chicken crostini and Calamari, acciughe e fritti di Gamberi.Fungi misti e Formaggi is a platter of mushrooms mixed with fresh greens, walnuts, broccoli and cheese. It has the nutty flavour of walnuts, bitterness of blanched broccoli and the earthy flavour of grilled mushrooms, and comes with an Italian dressing. The Chicken crostini has grilled pesto chicken, olives, onions, bell peppers on a crunchy Tuscan bread served with mixed greens. The olives neutralises the cheese. Smothered in a creamy, basil pesto, it brings out the char-grilled taste of the chicken. It serves as a comfort food.The Calamari in Calamari acciughe e fritti di Gamberi is crunchy and chewy. The crispy soft prawns in the platter goes well with the dip. It is served with french fries and salad. To cleanse our palate, an intermediate course of fruit sorbets topped with mint leaves are served. Next comes the main course. The Risotto aifunghi misti e porri has mushrooms blended with leek risotto prepared with truffle oil. Warm and starchy, it is healthy and makes you feel good. It's a dish that you can have during the rains. The Chicken scaloppini has thinly sliced chicken breast with truffle-flavoured mushroom wine butter sauce, grilled mushroom, tomato and buttered creamy spinach.The platter has garlic mashed potatoes and rosemary grilled veggies that includes broccoli, beans and cauliflower. The mashed potato is a favourite. Even people who do not prefer potatoes, would love it. It has a dominant pungent taste of garlic.The Burro di Dory e aranciapan is a fried polenta crusted John Dory fish with lemon couscous, spaghetti of vegetables, tomato salsa and orange butter sauce. The dish is not bad but it did not meet our expectations.The fish looks crunchy but is not. The vegetables in the noodles adds crunch to the dish. It has grainy Mediterranean khus khus. The desserts are the highlight. The Salted Vanilla Cheese Cake is the best of the lot. It looks so colourful and appealing that you don't want to disturb the presentation. Served with ice cream, the cheesecake platter also has strawberry sauce. Most Americans prefer to have the cheesecake topped with this sauce.But, people here might not take to it and, hence, it is served on the side. The Chocolate, Banana crepe is nice. The thin crepe is smooth. It is caramelised right. The chocolate sauce does not overpower the taste of the banana. It is served with almond Praline and Vanilla ice cream. The Strawberry and Chocolate Ganache Tart has crumbs of red velvet. It is buttery. The outer layer of the tart, made of bisuits, adds a creamy crunch to it. Cost for two: `1,500"

The new menu, which is for only a month at Smoke House Deli, offers six varieties of meats. There is the one Roasted Chicken and Classic Sauce Supreme and Potato Cake, which is served with potato, mushroom, tomato, cream and cheese. Chicken is juicy, abounding in creamy flavours of mushroom while the skin remains delightfully crisp.The potato cake layered with thin slices and sandwiching cheese and egg oozes, when cut, to compliment the fibrous chicken. Boiled tomato gives the meal an acidic twist. Grilled Rib Eye steak, with beef, is served with carrots and asparagus tossed in butter. The ribs are directly grilled without marination so the mild flavour of the meat is retained. Sauce Robert, a brown mustard sauce, is poured over the beef and the brown sauce tastes sharply of onion and butter, the two primary ingredients of Sauce Robert.The meat is hard and chewy, with a sour cream topping the taste balances out. Now onto the Pan Grilled Quail served with Spaghetti Chicken Bolognaise; expect an attractive presentation. The roasted quail nestles on classic spaghetti. The first bite is smoky and bitter and the taste lingers to turn sweeter. Quail tastes like chicken but the flavour is stronger. Minced chicken tossed in spaghetti and harmonised with zesty red wine makes this delectable.Almost similar in style but distinct in flavour is the Pan-seared breast of Duck and Soya Chilli Noodles that bursts with flavours of chilli and garlic. The tangy orange sauce has been tossed with noodles along with chunks of orange. Over this is placed glazed and juicy duck meat. The salad served to the side has lettuce, barley and duck feet, a refreshingly new combination.Besides the bird variety, Crumbed Lamb Cutlets and Mint Pesto is another surprise because this is the only meat in the menu that is fried in butter and not grilled. Caramalised, juicy and crisp, the lamb is cooked to perfection. Grilled Fresh Pork Chops with Home-made Hash Brown is shallow-grilled pork ribs and is medium-rare. The chewy and salty flavour of the pork meshed well with smokey cake-like Hash Brown. Cost for two: `2,000"

Kolkata is known for its trademark roll, a sumptuous snack where chicken or mutton pieces sauted with onions and masala are rolled inside a layered and flaky paratha, and served wrapped in thin paper. The snack was conceived by a small restaurant named Nizams near Hogg Market, Kolkata about eighty years ago, arguably as food to be consumed on the go.Initially it was known as kathi roll, because kebabs inside the rolls were charcoal grilled on wooden sticks or kathi. However, over the decades, as the snack became increasingly popular and roll centres mushroomed all over the city, partially cooked meat finished on a tawa started mostly being used instead of kebabs. A large variety of rolls have evolved in the last couple of decades with eggs added to the paratha, and a vegetarian version using potato or paneer as stuffing. The trend of using tomato or chilli sauces in the filling have also become common, much to the dismay of a puritan like me. One of the reasons of popularity of this street food is that it can serve as a utility lunch, evening snack or dinner. You can customise your roll by adding more layers to it, starting from a simple chicken roll and scaling up to the double egg double chicken version.It is fascinating to see a Kolkata style roll being prepared right in front of you. Freshly rolled out layered and flaky paratha is fried in oil on a tawa. For an egg roll, egg is added on the paratha while frying. The filling is prepared separately with meat, onion, optionally veggies like capsicum or cucumber, and a masala  for the last one many shops have their own proprietary versions. Then the paratha is deftly rolled with this filling, and sauces, lime, chopped chillies and dry masala added as per customer specification.In Hyderabad, the Kolkata style rolls have been popularised by Roll Call, that started as a kiosk selling rolls in Madhapur from 2002. They now have roll centres all over the city. Jayeeta Majumdar Singhee, one of the partners at Roll Call mentioned that apart from the authentic rolls from Kolkata, they have also introduced spicy versions like Chicken and Paneer 65 rolls for the local Hyderabadi palate. Overall, they have around 30 variants of rolls with versions like cheese rolls, seekh kebab rolls and reshmi kebab rolls and the rolls are also easy on the pockets priced at `50-100 range. Roll Durbar in Gachibowli, Amantran in Domalguda and Kolkata House in Kondapur are some other places to enjoy Kolkata style rolls."

The BKRG comprises of a group of Kochi natives, engaged in different vocations, who intervene in public related issues and aim to make the city a better place. We have decided to spread this campaign to Thiruvananthapuram and other parts of the state as well, said Gopakumar.He said their campaign was inspired from a Japanese movement in which the people boycotted anything that shows an unnatural increase in price.The campaign which started on July 22 is likely to continue till August 15. Till we see a decline in the price of tomatoes to Rs 50 per kg. The campaign waspropagated through Whatsapp. A similar price hike is seen in other food items like green chillies and chicken as well, he added.Gopakumar said Kochiites should either completely stop or minimise consumption of tomatoes just for a few weeks.This will have a demoralising effect on those hoarding the vegetable. It will in turn bring down the price within a week or two. If we stand united, we will be able to ensure the campaign is a huge success, he added.Meanwhile, the price of tomato came down to Rs 85 on Monday from last weeks price of Rs 110 per kg. While many have turned to other alternatives some still buy tomatoes, though in smaller quantities. Tomatoes are an essential ingredient in every dish we make whether its is sambar or rasam. The price hike last month has affected the middle class, said Jisha K, a housewife.Recently, the Union Government had pointed out that the price hike of tomatoes is only a seasonal phenomena. It also warned the state government to conduct regular inspections to prevent artificial storage and supply of stock. The vegetable vendors said the supply from the northern states has dropped sharply due to rain. It is estimated 70 per cent of the tomato crop has been damaged due to excess rain."

My chauffeur Tim had a lovely dog Brady, who insisted on taking the ride with me. We raced on the streets, as Bradys fur gently caressed my cheek. We drove past the Castle of Good Hope (built in the 17th century, it is the best-preserved example of a Dutch East India Company fort), Houses of Parliament and the Companys Garden (created in 1650s by the first European settlers, it is a park and heritage site).Then we headed to Sea Point, Cape Towns most affluent and densely populated suburb. At Camps Bay, another affluent suburb, we took a break to enjoy the scenic ocean vistas as Brady ran and played on the beach sand.Then happened Bo-Kaap. It is the prettiest neighbourhood in Cape Town with houses that are swathed in loveliest colours, standing on romantic cobbled streets from the 18th century. It is neither upmarket nor is it a posh quarter of Cape Town filled with mansions.But it seemed to be the most photogenic place where houses were like colourful birds perched in a row. The Bo-Kaap, formerly known as the Malay Quarter is situated on the slopes of Signal Hill above the city centre. It is the traditional home of Cape Towns Muslim population since the second half of the eighteenth century. The houses are a mixture of Cape Dutch and Cape Georgian architectural styles and this, combined with the Islamic faith, culture and eastern origin of the majority of its inhabitants, give the Bo-Kaap a setting that visitors find both captivating and exotic.Descendants of indentured labour brought by the Dutch from various Asian (mostly Malaysia and Indonesia) and African countries, during the 16th and 17th centuries, these slaves were generally called Cape Malays, though not all of them were of Malaysian origin. When the British took over Cape Town from the Dutch in 1795, the slave trade was abolished. When their slavery ended, they acquired religious freedom and the newly emancipated slaves formed a new community at Bo-Kaap. The founders of this community were the first to bring Islam to South Africa.Intermarriages between slaves from East Indies with those from India, Madagascar, and native African groups created a distinctive Cape Malay culture. It is said that many local women converted to Islam and married Muslim men, as they are teetotallers and made trouble free husbands. People in the Cape Malay community speak mostly Afrikaans and English, with Malay words and phrases thrown in. Bo-Kaaps multifaceted heritage is reflected in its music, dance and food too.Adaptations of traditional foods such as tomato bredie, bobotie, sosaties and koeksisters which are the staples in many South African homes originated from Cape Malay cuisine, which in itself is a fusion of many cuisines.Bo-Kaap Kombuis (Kitchen) is a place everyone recommends for an authentic Cape Malay meal. Their starters reminded me of home: samosas (just like our alu samosas), rolls, dalchies (similar to Indian spinach and moong dal pakoras), and patatawaras (like our batata wada back home). The Indian influence in the main courses too is evident due to generations of widespread intermarriage and union between the two communities.Yusuf Larney runs the joint with his wife Nazli who is a third generation Indian from Gujarat while Yusufs great grandfather came from Ireland. His forefathers married people from the Eastern countries and were integrated into Cape Malay culture. Speaking of Bo-Kaap, he said 90% of the population here is Muslim while the other 10% are Christians, Hindus and Indians. We all live with absolutely no conflict, it is the safest area in the whole of S A. We welcome inter marriages. We respect each other: we believe in sitting across the table and talk to each other first to sort out problems than first go and kill each other.I took a stroll down the road, feasting my eyes on every house. As we walked along, JP threw light on the brightly coloured houses on either side of the street, which, he said, is a recent innovation that celebrates the districts Muslim identity. In earlier days, all the houses of Cape Town were painted white. Then the residents of Bo-Kaap began painting their houses in vivid colours in preparation for the celebration of Eid. Neighbours would often agree on what colours to use so as not to have a clash of shades - in fact, the colours complement each other and act as landmarks as well. But sometimes, to outdo others, some clever residents paint their house a different colour overnight and surprise the neighbours!Of course, the last statement seemed a big joke, his own fiction, like most guides of his ilk. His jokes were often followed by his huge guffaws and gurgling laughter, hinting us to take the cue. JP made our Cape Town visit a huge fun, in fact, as huge as his enormous frame!(The author is a documentary filmmaker and travel writer; she blogs at ijayaprataptravelandbeyond.com)"

Contrary to popular belief, Dubai offers a delectable treat to vegetarians as well. Kusdhari, an Egyptian dish made of rice; macaroni and lentils; and charcoal lemonade are just some of the various delicacies that Dubai has to offer.Given the large Indian population in Dubai, it is only fitting that India gets a proportionate representation in Dubais cuisine.

Gomathi of Periyar Nagar in Erode. Dependence on non-vegetarian food has increased in the past one month from weekly once to thrice. We have to work on cost cutting measures for a balanced budget, she says.From tomatoes and small onions to even the fresh greens, prices of most vegetables are up across the region. It is the result of a combination of factors, say farmers, traders, and officials. Failure of monsoon last year and demonetisation had an impact on sowing, they say.Dharmapuri, Salem, Namakkal, Coimbatore and the Nilgiris are among the main horticulture crop growing centres in the State.Over 3,500 hectares are under tomato crop in the blocks of Mecheri, Kaadayampatti, Omalur, Pethanayakkanpalayam, Attur in Salem district. Small onion is raised in more than 4,000 hectares in Namakkal district and about 700 hectares in the Kolathur, Vazhappadi and Gangavalli blocks in Salem district.Repeated failure of monsoon resulted in standing crops withering in many parts, leading to fall in the arrival in the uzhavar santhais and open markets, say officials in Salem and Namakkal.Three kg of tomato was priced at Rs. 10 in May and now it is Rs. 60 - Rs. 64 a kg. During the peak season period, the uzhavar santhais used to receive about seven tonnes of tomatoes every day. Currently, about five tonnes of tomatoes reach the market.Following the commencement of small onion harvesting season in Salem District, there has been reasonable increase in the arrival of onion stock from the villages. The price of small onion which stood at more than Rs. 100 per kg last month, has come down. The price of good quality small onion stood at Rs. 84 and the second quality onion at Rs. 80 at the Salem Uzhavar Santhai on Sunday. The prices of tomatoes and small onions are expected to stabilise in the Salem wholesale markets once arrivals start from the nearby cultivation pockets.The shortage of rainfall and demonetisation seem to have played into the cropping area in Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts. Bathalahalli is the largest wholesale market that attracts traders from across the State and sends vegetables to Kerala too. The general fall in production of vegetables in Thally, Denkanikottai, Hosur and Rayakottai  whose farmers are the largest suppliers of cabbage, tomatoes, beans, carrots, beets, is one of the reasons for the price rise. The supply has fallen, but the demand has increased, say traders.President of Traders Association of Bathalahalli market Raja Reddy says the number of trucks loading vegetables is between 80 to 100 tonne on any day and it has remained almost the same, subject to availability of vegetables. The price of most vegetables range from Rs. 50 to Rs. 60 per kg. Beans has been going at Rs. 50 per kg for the last 6 months, he says. This year, tomato cultivation fell significantly. Its price at the market is Rs. 70 per kg, he adds. Normally, June- August witness a rise in tomato prices largely coinciding with the fall in the vegetables production in other growing regions of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.The 70-day crop was hit right when demonetisation came. Farmers, who were already mid-way into the crop and awaiting harvest, were hit. To cut down on costs, the area of cultivation was also reduced, says a Rayakottai-based farmer.In the Nilgiris, though the prices of vegetables such as potatoes and tomatoes remains extremely high, English vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, beans and beetroot, which are produced in large quantities in the Nilgiris, have not seen a steep hike in prices.According to Raja Mohammed, a wholesale vegetable supplier, the wholesale rate of broccoli currently is Rs. 130 per kg., while carrots are sold for anywhere between Rs. 35-40 per kg. depending on the quality and freshness of the produce. Beetroot is also selling for between Rs. 28 to Rs. 35 per kg., which is the usual price that these vegetables are sold for during this season.The price of English vegetables increase only during the wedding season, when they are purchased in large quantities for feasts, he says. Though the prices of vegetables such as tomatoes and potatoes are still high, there has not been a major demand for cheaper alternatives, said other vegetable sellers in the Ooty Municipal Market.(With inputs from Syed Muthahar Saqaf in Salem, P.V.

The retail price on Tuesday stood at Rs. 80 a kg (both local and hybrid varieties). Top quality hybrid variety (bigger in size) is being sold at Rs. 90 a kg.Merchants predicted that the commonly used vegetable may cross Rs. 100 a kg in the retail market by the end of this week, if arrivals drop further. Households have begun buying tomato in smaller quantities to cope with the soaring price. Some have switched over to tamarind and lemon juice as alternatives. In supermarkets, medium quality tomato was sold at Rs. 70 a kg while the price of top variety is ranging between Rs. 80 and Rs. 90. However, in HOPCOMS, small-sized average variety is being sold at Rs. 53 a kg.The quantum of arrivals to the wholesale market has further dropped because of fall in production. Tomato is largely grown in fields having borewells. Many have completed planting recently and harvest is expected only next month or early September. Until then, prices may not fall drastically, but there is a likelihood of little drop in prices till early next month, sources in the APMC market said. Tomato yield is less this year compared to last year. Lack of rain and drop in groundwater table are among the reasons. Thanks to the recent showers, many have planted tomato, but it will take time for the prices to stabilise, said Kurubur Shanthakumar, founder president, Raitha Mitra Farmers Producers Company, Mysuru."

He said with the Income Tax Department warning against cash transactions of over Rs. 2 lakh, saying that the receiver of the amount would have to cough up an equal amount as penalty, wholesalers had been buying less from farmers.GST impactThis is the way business has been happening for years. Transporters charge us certain fee and then show smaller amounts on bills. Similarly, wholesalers make up this amount in some other area. Thats how we make profits. With GST, the law has gotten stricter and people are buying less, he said.He also said that the number of transporters had reduced as they now had to carry an e-way permit for carrying goods above Rs. 50,000.Rajini Kumar, a resident of south Delhis Vasant Kunj, said getting tomatoes from her local market had become a difficult task.The two times that I went to my local vegetable market around 8 p.m. to buy tomatoes, I got only rotten ones.

The June number was the lowest since CSO started publishing the new retail inflation data in 2012. Separate data showed the annual rate of inflation, based on the monthly wholesale price index, stood at 1.9% in July compared to 0.9% for the previous month and 0.6% during corresponding month of the previous year.The increase in WPI inflation was largely led by vegetables, minerals and some food items. Vegetable prices rose an annual 22% while mineral prices shot up 25%. Robust monsoon rains are expected to have a sobering impact on prices but floods in some parts may put some temporary strains on supplies.""As expected, CPI inflation rebounded to 2.4% in July 2017 from the series low of 1.5% in June 2017, on account of rising vegetable prices, the revision in HRA (house rent allowance) and, to some extent, higher GST on various services,"" said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ratings agency ICRA.Some economists said the data showed that fears of an increase in prices post introduction of GST and implementation of Housing Allowances on headline inflation are rather limited at this point. According to Soumya Kanti Ghosh , group chief economic adviser at SBI, the July inflation number should ""thus be a transient one purely contributed by tomato prices.""Core CPI inflation recorded a marginal uptick to 4% in July 2017 from 3.9% in the previous month. Nayar said prices of various vegetables have displayed a month-on-month hardening so far in August and in addition, a reversal of the favourable base effect could result in retail food inflation rising further in the ongoing month. She said the staggered impact on the housing index, of CPI of the HRA of central government employees, is likely to push up housing inflation further over the coming year.""As the favourable base effect unwinds, vegetable prices record a seasonal hardening and the impact of HRA pushes up housing inflation further, we expect CPI inflation to ramp up over the next few months, and cross 4% by October 2017. Based on this anticipated trajectory, and the recent commentary by the Monetary Policy Committee , we see a low likelihood of further rate cuts in FY-18,"" Nayar said.In its latest monetary policy review earlier this month the RBI had cut the repo rate to 6% but kept the monetary policy stance at neutral, flagging possible return of inflationary pressures. While the government has been eyeing a sharp cut in interest rates, RBI has maintained its cautious stance."

Retail inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index was revised downwards to 1.46 per cent for June.It is also a reflection of monthly kitchen costs, which continued to remain soft, with prices showing gradual improvement at (-) 0.29% from (-) 2.12 per cent in June against 8.35 per cent in the same period last year.The fall in food inflation has been brought about by disinflation in the prices of mainly pulses and vegetables, which is assessed to be a stabilising factor.Vegetable prices fell by (-)3.57 per cent in July compared with (-)16.53 per cent in June, prices of pulses fell (-)24.75 per cent, against (-)21.92 per cent in June. Prices of foods and beverages became costly by 0.43 per cent against (-)1.17 per cent growth. While fuel inflation was 4.84 per cent in June, against 5.46 per cent in May and data shows that housing inflation remained nearly flat, growing 4.98 per cent in July from 4.7 per cent in June.Higher food articles and vegetable prices have pushed up wholesale inflation for July by 1.88 per cent, compared to 0.9 per cent in June. Wholesale inflation was low in July last year at 0.63 per cent.Food prices of pulses, potatoes and onions experienced a free fall as a result of a supply glut. Vegetable prices were up 22 per cent in July as a result of a hike in tomato prices.The heavy rains and delay in crop arrival to the mandi/markets made it costly for the consumers as the prices grew by 25.47 per cent in June. However, the broad conditions for agri-prices remain conducive given normal monsoon in most parts of the country and stable global commodity prices. This outlook is also corroborated in the second part of the Economic Survey released last week, said Pankaj Patel, president, FICCI.The wholesale price index data shows the doubling in the rate of inflation in July was mainly on account of a turnaround in prices of food article, especially vegetables."

The one who constantly has a FOMO (fear of missing out) everytime the gang goes pub hopping. I feel your pain, with the scarce vegetarian options in comparison to the non vegetarians.Now that I have ranted out, heres some good news for my vegetarian patrons. TGI Fridays is now hosting VEg Fiesta, that features exotic American and Tex-Mex delicacies.Thankfully this casual dining restaurants idea of vegetarian food festival did not mean binging on paneer. FYI to pubs in Bengaluru, replacing chicken with paneer doesnt exactly cut it.The menu includes Mexican Vegetable Platter  an assortment of cauliflower wings, balsamic grilled mushroom veggie skewers, vegetali tostados, served with garlic bread and New Orleans Corn Cob and choice of side from Pasta Puttanesca and Caesar Salad.Portobello, Bean and Quinoa Burger is well seasoned, with flavours of spiced bean and quinoa patty and the really soft bun making it a delicious bite. I am definitely going back for the buttery rich Multigrain Brioche Bun and the pan seared Portobello mushroom. What a burger!The crunchy Franks Red Cauliflower Wings is my idea of the vegetable fried with spicy batter. However, this one a bit too sour to my liking and was served with a sauce, which too was sour. I would pass on this one.The Sizzling Portobello and Aubergine Fajita was one juicy succulent bite to dig into. Okay, now lets talk about this delicious bite, shall we? It has the grilled marinated Portobello mushroom with grilled spicy eggplant served on a skillet of roasted onions, red and green capsicum.The fajita has a dose of the good carbs with flaky tomato flavoured rice. Yes, I would go back for the fajitas. Any day. Pico de gallo and guacamole were offered as toppings.The Funghi Trifolati Truffled Pizza too has marinated Portobello mushroom slices cooked in Truffle oil. The pizza is a thin crust one, topped with olives, cherry tomatoes and a dollop of mozzarella. It is pretty decent on the taste part. I was too busy fishing mushroom slices off the pizza.Am I a mushroom fanatic? Well, may be.Milkshake paradiseThe restaurant is also has a new Franken Shakes menu where shakes go wild on Fridays. We tried the Whole Lotta Cho-co-lat and boy, was it beyond our imagination delicious. The decadent chocolate milkshake topped with whipped cream is topped with brownie, chocolate doughnut and chocolate sauce. Yup, this drink should in fact be illegal. And I am not even done describing it yet. The glass in which the shake is served is covered with frozen fosting with chocolate chips and Hersheys Kisses embedded on it. It was sinfully delicious and yes, I asked my colleague if she could help me down the stairs after this shake.Cost for two: `1,000 (approx.)"
