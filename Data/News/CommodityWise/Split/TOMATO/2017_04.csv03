It proved effective, as the prices slumped after we circulated a request to minimise consumption of tomato. From Rs. 110 a kg, the price came down to Rs. 55 and below a few days after hundreds of groups shared the message, said architect S. Gopakumar of Better Kochi Response Group. The campaign titled No Tomato Week began on July 22 and went on till July 30 in the initial phase. Mr. Gopakumar said the initiative was on the lines of a tradition followed in Japan, wherein they stop consuming commodities whose prices go up exponentially. This leads to a fall in their prices, he said.The WhatsApp group message urged all members to either stop or minimise consumption of tomato just for a week or 10 days. The aim was to demoralise hoarders. Members said the prices had slumped within 10 days of the start of the campaign. This group activity to check price rise can be implemented on a long-term basis, Mr. Gopakumar said.Meanwhile, residents associations here are also using social media to instantaneously circulate messages on relevant issues. A. Ajithkumar, general secretary of Ernakulam District Residents Association Apex Council, said at least seven WhatsApp groups were active at the zonal level.Residents have formed groups to share photographs and news on poor infrastructure in their respective localities. They believe that circulating photographs of potholed roads and damaged canals on social media will evoke immediate response from elected representatives."
5a0f4f7a9855b76bf13d7d68,Vegetable prices to remain high,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vegetable-prices-to-remain-high/article19468826.ece,2017-08-11,"Vegetable prices have been on the rise in the city for the last few days and are likely to remain high for the next few days.The average price of vegetables now is Rs. 30 a kg, says M. Rajendran, president of Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants Association.The wholesale price of tomato is Rs. 40 a kg, small onion Rs. 70 a kg and big onion Rs. 30 a kg. Beans, carrot, yam and okra are all Rs. 40 a kg. In the case of chilli, it is Rs. 50 a kg. The prices of tomato and small onion are expected to come down and that of big onion go up, he says.Poor rainfallThe main reason for the spiralling prices is poor rainfall, say vegetable traders.There is no shortage in availability of vegetables and the demand has not reduced much because of the prices. Even in places where the rain has been good now, it will take three months for arrivals to start from these areas.Most of the arrivals to Coimbatore now are from other States.Further, there are restrictions to avoid overloading of trucks and transport costs are up, adding to the prices of the vegetables, Mr. Rajendran says.Hoteliers, domestic consumers and bulk buyers are affected equally. Even a domestic consumer needs four or five varieties of vegetables a day. Tomatoes and onions are essential. If the prices continue to remain high, it will bring down the volume of purchase.Usually, prices are down during this period. Arrivals from different parts of the State are not there now and most of the vegetables come from other States. Though hotels buy directly from farmers, availability is down this year because of monsoon failure, says D. Srinivasan, president of Coimbatore District Hoteliers Association. The volume of vegetables used cannot be reduced and there are no substitutes to replace some vegetables. Hence, hotels are finding it difficult to manage. Business is down 30 % since the implementation of GST, he says.The demand for vegetables will go up next month as the festival season starts and this might lead to further increase in prices, adds Mr. Rajendran."
5a0f51649855b76bf13d7e3f,are vegetable prices soaring?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/are-vegetable-prices-soaring/article19527329.ece,2017-08-20,"What happened in July?July saw a rise in inflation at the wholesale level to 1.88% from 0.9% in June, with the spiralling tomato prices, along with other food items, contributing significantly to this rise. Tomatoes saw a sharp inflation of over 209.5% in July against contraction of 29.4% in June, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. Brinjal registered a rise in inflation to 21.1% in July, from Junes contraction of 3.1%. The prices of tomato, onion and potato have increased in recent months owing to disparity between demand and supply on account of a drop in production because of unfavourable weather, a rise in transport costs, seasonality and supply chain constraints.Why is supply low?While the rise in the retail prices of tomato is being associated with low supply from key growing States, including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka following heavy rain in a few regions that damaged the crop and hindered transport as well, onion prices have seen a rise on account of low supply from the southern States.The fluctuation in vegetable prices, which is commonly referred to as seasonal, is associated with the economics of demand and supply. The Centre maintains that seasonal fluctuations in market arrivals have hit supplies. The other reasons for the fall in supply are adverse weather conditions and imperfections in marketing channels. However, the clash of interests between the consumer, the producer and the middlemen is a key factor that policy-makers must urgently address.Where is the problem?For years, the consumer, the producer (farmer) and the middleman have had a clash of interest when it comes to agricultural commodities. While the consumer wants to buy a commodity at the lowest price, the producer (farmer) desires to sell the produce at the maximum price. The middleman, on the other hand, wants to maximise profits. Striking a balance among these stakeholders could possibly address the issue of price fluctuation to some extent. Vegetable producers, especially small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. As vegetables find their way to the market, the cost of packaging, grading, transporting and fees, besides the margins of the middlemen, are some of the elements that determine the final price the consumer has to bear.Will better storage help?Agricultural commodities with a short shelf-life are prone to price fluctuation and hence require better infrastructure for marketing.Economists like Prof. M.S. Sidhu at Punjab Agricultural University believe that improved transport and upgraded storage infrastructure will keep a check on price volatility. Indias cold storage capacity at present is nearly 3.5 crore tonnes, which is short by 30-40 lakh tonnes, and it needs to be increased. Besides, cold storages need to be upgraded, equipping them to store fruit and vegetables at right temperatures so that they stay fresh.Also, the high cost of transport needs to be addressed. In the case of perishable vegetables, the government could consider promoting low-cost refrigerated trucks and weigh the option of freight subsidy.According to an estimate, there are 7,000-8,000 refrigerated trucks plying in India, mostly transporting pharmaceuticals and dairy products. Transport of perishable vegetables in refrigerated trucks could be one of the options that would help in better supply and availability of the produce.What about the supply chain?The mismanagement in the supply chain is another reason for the huge gap in prices that growers sell perishable agricultural commodities for and what the consumer pays. Creation of co-operative groups and societies are probably an alternative that could assist in minimising the marketing channel. They can work in tandem across the States and supply vegetables from surplus regions to places where the produce is in demand.Most farmers in India have small landholdings. Nearly 85% farmers are small, who have less than 2 hectares. Cultivation has become unviable for these small farmers, but through cooperative groups and societies even a small quantity of crop produced by the farmer can be marketed. This will stabilise prices and benefit consumers.VIKAS VASUDEVA"

Vegetable suppliers in Tamil Nadu do not foresee a scarcity or higher prices as most of the areas in the State have received sufficient rains, said a wholesale vegetable dealer in Kochi on Sunday.Shallots (small onions) have taken the place of tomatoes with the price of the vegetable now ranging around Rs. 90 a kg in the retail market. But tomato price has come down to about Rs. 40 a kg.The price of nendran variety of bananas, in great demand during the Onam season, has gone up to nearly Rs. 70 a kg in retail stores. The price of njalipoovan too is up at around Rs. 75 a kg.The price of vegetable cowpea has stabilised at around Rs. 50 a kg; okra and French beans are selling for Rs. 36 and Rs. 50 a kg respectively.The price of green chilli is around Rs. 50 a kg in the retail market. The overall price level has steadied, and the situation is expected to be more stable during the coming week, said the trader pointing to sufficient availability of produce from different supply centres in neighbouring States."

This means that there has been an additional income of Rs 53,747Cr to farmers in 2016-17"", principal secretary agriculture Rajesh Rajora told TOI.With an objective to give a new momentum to the food processing industry in state, state government has decided to open 500 food processing units in this year. These units will be opened by individuals and government will provide a subsidy of 40% of investment cost to farmers of general category and 50% to the farmers belonging to SC and ST category. Decision in this regards was taken in the Krishi cabinet held at Bhopal on Monday.Explaining the model of these processing units, Rajora said, ""These units will be owned by the farmers and government will provide a subsidy of 40% for people belonging to the general category and 50% of the investment cost to the people belonging to the SC & ST community, the units will be set up in the villages. These units will also have packaging facilities. Thus, it will provide local farmers with the opportunity to not only sell their raw products but also sell their processed products. For example, a farmer growing garlic could also sell its paste, packaged and labelled as his brand. Likewise, tomato puree, processed vegetables etc. There are 16 such category of processing units.""""It is one of its kind initiative and the sole objective is to diversify the rural economy and give a boost to food processing in the state. Till now, the food processing industry is not getting such priority in another other state,"" claimed Rajora."

5a11065b9855b76bf13dbb53,Farm livelihoods: beware of RCEP,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/629065/farm-livelihoods-beware-rcep.html,2017-08-20,"By Devinder Sharma, Aug 20 2017, 23:08 ISTIt was always known, but when a United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) report in 2003 explained in detail how devastating cheaper imports of agricultural commodities and products have been to domestic production, and presented a chart detailing out how a surge in imports acted as a strong blow to the local economy, I thought the world would sit back and take notice.On the contrary, international trade negotiations have now taken a more aggressive stance. More and more opening up of the trade barriers has destroyed millions of livelihoods in the bargain.Lets examine what is at stake. Over the past few decades, especially after 1995 when the World Trade Organisation (WTO) came into existence, the effort has been to force developing countries to remove trade barriers and import duties.According to FAO, when imports of tomato paste increased by 15 times in Senegal, local production declined by 50%; when vegetable oil imports doubled in Jamaica, it recorded a 68% cut in domestic production.In India, too, when imports of vegetable oils surged between 1993-94 and 2015-16 following a systematic reduction in import duties over the years, India turned from a position of self-sufficiency to become the worlds second biggest importer of edible oils.What was attempted initially through the WTO was aggressively pushed under bilateral Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and regional trade pacts. While numerous studies have shown that India has hardly gained from the opening up of the domestic market, the damage done to agriculture has been enormous.As if this is not enough, a Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) treaty, which concluded its latest round of negotiations in Hyderabad in July, is considering removing import duties on 92% of all traded commodities. Worse, it is believed that a draconian provision whereby the import duties that will be reduced to zero under the treaty cannot be raised later, is being considered, a provision that even the WTO did not impose.In other words, the RCEP treaty, if India agrees to sign, would open up the Indian market for zero import duty for all times to come. It will take away the right from India to protect and ensure the livelihood security of its 600 million farmers. The treaty is being negotiated between 16 countries, including South Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and China.Surprisingly, every time India enters into a trade negotiation, it seeks greater market access for its services, including easier norms for its professionals to move across borders for short-term work.While this is certainly important, one fails to understand why agriculture is being deliberately sacrificed in the bargain. After all, domestic agriculture, which entails the livelihoods of 600 million farmers, cannot be placed on the chopping block of international trade.Grim prospectsTake the case of the dairy sector. According to Jayan Mehta, senior general manager of Amul dairy cooperatives, the livelihoods of 150 million people engaged in dairy farming will be severely if RCEP negotiations continue on current lines.India is the biggest producer of milk in the world. Presently, the import of milk and milk products are allowed with an import duty ranging from 40% to 60%. This provides enough protection for the local dairy industry to build its competitiveness.Opening up the flood gates will inundate India with cheaper milk flowing in from Australia and New Zealand. Let us not forget that while Australia, with only 6,300 dairy farmers and New Zealand, with 12,000, are pushing aggressively to protect the economic interests of their small dairy farming communities, India is willing to sacrifice the livelihoods of 150 million dairy farmers.Since India has a huge domestic demand for milk, it doesnt have the kind of export surplus that Australia and New Zealand have. Just because those countries are willing to provide greater access to Indian IT professionals, should India jeopardize the livelihoods of 150 million dairy farmers?Dairy is not the only commodity for which the market is to open up. India will have to open up for all kinds of fruits, vegetables, pulses, potatoes, spices, plantation crops, seeds, silk, processed foods, etc.Although India is still insisting on allowing zero tariff import on only 80% of the traded goods, and is seeking a three-tier structure, the negotiations are led by the dominant and aggressive stance of countries like China, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea, which will eventually have their say.It has taken so many years for the world to understand that the WTO was designed to serve the commercial interests of only the top 1%. The RCEP treaty, being negotiated without drawing any lessons from the WTO experience, would strike a much severe blow. What was negotiated in the Hyderabad round of talks has not been made public. It is being done in complete secrecy.A few people sitting in heavily guarded negotiations take decisions which eventually impact the future of 99% of the population. This is grossly unfair."

It also cut its GVA growth forecast to 6.9 per cent from the earlier 7.2 per cent.Stating that the RBI may go for a rate cut at the December review of the policy, BofAML said, ""Although inflation is turning up to 3.1 per cent in August on rising tomato and onion prices and 4.6-4.9 per cent in 1H18, it is still well within the RBI's 2-6 per cent inflation target.""HSBC said there are ""downward risks"" to its growth forecast of 7.1 per cent, while Japanese brokerage Nomura cut its calendar 2017 forecast by 0.20 per cent to 6.7 per cent.""The key question is how soon the economy will recover from the GST-led disruptions,"" Nomura said. The brokerage, however, said that the RBI will hold rates.Analysts at Morgan Stanley said they continue to see a recovery, but the data release poses downward risks to its growth forecasts.""The key risks to the outlook are the impact of weaker monsoon on agricultural output; the pace of NPL resolution, which would affect credit growth; and private capex and global trade conditions,"" it said.India's GDP grew slower at 5.7 per cent during April-June -- the lowest in three years of the Modi government while lagging China for the second straight quarter -- as manufacturing slowed ahead of the GST launch and note ban impact lingered.Gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the first quarter of 2017-18 was lower than 6.1 per cent of the preceding one and 7.9 per cent in the same period last fiscal.China recorded 6.9 per cent growth in January-March as well as April-June quarters.Expressing concern on the GDP numbers, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said manufacturing growth rate seems to have bottomed out as GST has been implemented and destocking of pre-GST stocks is almost complete."
