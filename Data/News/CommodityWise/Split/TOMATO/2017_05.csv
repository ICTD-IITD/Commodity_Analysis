I have been an entrepreneur throughout my career, with startups in the food and manufacturing industries. After my stints in the corporate world, I decided to take a leap of faith and decided to pursue my passion for food and cooking.I am a self-taught chef. I do not have any fancy cordon bleu training but I know that our kitchens are, in many ways, the most vital and important space for discourse of all sorts. We learn at the kitchen table. We argue, we affirm, we try to figure things out.As a chef, it is important to know our ingredients, understand them and know how best to use them. One of the ingredients that has intrigued me the most is vinegar. Vinegar has been used is various cuisines for thousands of years. There are records of Egyptians using vinegar to preserve food. Vinegar in dishes improves the flavour, is often used in salad dressings, used in marinades. For me, I love the acidity that vinegar adds to a dish. It gives a complexity and new layer of flavour. No dish better illustrates the virtues of vinegar than a classic gazpacho.To make this cold soup the traditional way, mash chopped tomatoes, red bell peppers with seeds, seedless cucumber, minced garlic and one-day old bread in an earthenware or glass bowl. Place a fine-mesh strainer over a separate bowl, then, working in batches, use a flexible spatula to push the mashed mixture, including its liquid, through the strainer. If you want to save time, use a hand-cranked food mill or a high-powered blender to make your puree. After extracting as much moisture as possible from the solids, discard them. Stir the oil into the strained gazpacho. Taste, add salt and/or vinegar, as needed. Transfer to an airtight container; refrigerate until ready to use. Garnish with diced tomatoes, red and green bell-pepper and white onions and small croutons.The journey from cooking as a hobby to passion and to a full-time profession has involved many such interesting experiments.- Chef KanishkaChef will be curating a menu at the Chef Social Event at Little Green Caf, Museum Road today."

For a few years now, ecologically conscious individuals have been thinking of alternatives for this, and that has resulted in Ganeshas being made with wool, coconut fibre and many other natural materials. Lately, after the popularity of seedballs for afforestation purposes, seedball Ganeshas can be seen doing the rounds. One such green buff, is Ganeshram, who is selling seedball Ganeshas to Bengalureans.The Bengaluru-based naturalist spends most of his time travelling for projects related to water conservation, sustainable food production and conservation of indigenous flora. This is an idea that has been in the air all the while, but with very few people acting on it. I am being helped by my brother and a few friends, and this is my second year at it, he says, adding that the city has really taken to this idea, as the response to his Ganeshas has been overwhelming. I have been swamped with queries for the past few days, and Im glad to see that youngsters and older people alike are opting for these idols. Most are curious to know how it works, and what seeds these idols have, says Ganeshram.They sell Ganeshas of different sizes, ranging from 4 to 12. The 4 idol costs `80, and that, he says, is the one that has been selling the most. The Ganeshas prepared this year by him have a mix of different vegetable seeds such as tomato, brinjal, chilli, ladies finger, mustard and greens such a fenugreek. We have been instructing people to not dump the idols into lakes or ponds, but to submerge them in water vessels at home and pour the mixture into a pot or onto soil. Alternatively, to place the idol in a pot containing soil, in an area receiving a good amount of sunlight and water it everyday, he says. He works along with a potter family near Frazer Town that makes these idols. This system has been working economically for them too, he says.Telling us a bit about the harmful effects of PoP on the environment, he says, PoP does not dissolve in water. Another issue is with various dyeing agents/ paints used on Ganesha idols these days. Many of them are heavy metal-based, and are toxic not just to smaller lifeforms, but also to the humans coming in contact with them. He adds that the food webs and interconnections between various organisms are so intricate in nature that more often than not, we really dont know how it affects the environment. All our anthropocentric inventions solve human needs/wants in the short term, and are generally not oriented towards sustainability or ecology, he says.

I just had the most delicious vegetarian version of Nasi goreng that there is, born out of chef Sachin Talwar's intelligent choice of ingredients and his love for food making that reflects in his creations.The spiced pre-cooked fried rice has mushroom and cottage cheese bites and is topped with a cottage cheese layer, which served as the vegetarian equivalent of an egg topping. The spice mix in the rice is a brilliant blend to say the least. The dish completes itself with peanut butter sauce, fried papad and vegetable satay on the side.The dish is part of ""World Street Food Festival"" at My Fortune, Bengaluru. The festival includes Cheese Baked Nachos, Double Decker, Veggie Burger, Eggplant and cheese Fritters, Falafel, Mexican Re-fried Beans Gorditas, Paneer Khurchan Kathi Roll, Tofu Satay with Peanut Putter Sauce, Veggie Nasi goreng, Veggie Wraps, American Chicken Supreme Burger, Arrosticini Abruzzesi, Chicken Satay with Peanut Butter Sauce, Garlic Chicken Wings, Hot Dog, Mexican Lamb Gorditas, Murgh Khurchan Kathi Roll and Nasi Goreng.The Cheese Baked Nachos are crisp, layered with corn, tomatoes, onions and zuchini. The sour cream and salsa dip, both score high on taste and technique.The Chicken Satay with Peanut Butter Sauce is an unusual combination for an Indian palate, but once you dig in, you wouldn't stop with just one bite. The chicken is grilled right with Indonesian spices and the peanut butter sauce adds a tinge of sweetness to the dish.The Eggplant and cheese Fritters are extremely crunchy on the outside and has smooth cheesey texture on the inside with well-cooked aubergine slice layered in. It is served with cumin and olive oil induced pimento sauce. The jalapeno stuffed in the patties lifts the flavour of the ensemble. The Garlic Chicken Wings served as an Italian twist to a Chinese preparation. The meat has chilli flakes on top, is roasted well and has a strong flavour and aroma of olive oil. It isn't too spicy and will suit the taste buds well.The Paneer Khurchan Kathi Roll is a maida roll stuffed with onion, tomatoes and paneer chunks. The fish and chips served on the table was another winner of the evening. The batter fried fish melts in your mouth. The Basa fish is light and the corn flour batter adds crunch to the dish. It is served with French fries and tato suace on the side. The ""World Street Food Festival"" is being hosted at My Fortune, Bengaluru until September 17. Cost: `2,000 for two people (approx.)"

(Photo | AP)KHAZIR CAMP: Fawaz Saleh Ahmed has been secretly sneaking into his own village in northern Iraq to visit his home.The last time he went, he wept as he spent several hours going from room to room in the partially destroyed house, he said. When his tears dried, he made his way back to the nearby Khazir camp housing those displaced by war, where he and his family have lived for almost a year.Frustratingly, tantalizingly, he can see his house from there, but the Kurdish forces controlling his village, called Hassan Shami, won't allow him to return to live.""That is my house there on the hill, do you see it?"" said Ahmed, a member of Iraq's once-dominant Sunni Arab minority. He stretched his arm to point.The 39-year-old Ahmed's predicament is part of the wider disaster facing Iraq's Sunni Arabs. Three years of war have freed their lands from the rule of the Islamic State group but have also left the community at its lowest state ever. Sunnis are feeling lost, unsure what their place will be in the country's future and worried that the Shiite majority and the Kurds aim to change the demographics of some Sunni areas to impose their own control.Sunnis have been barred from returning to their homes in numerous villages and towns that the Kurds seized during fighting with Islamic State militants in a belt of territory across the north stretching down to Iraq's eastern border.Kurdish officials cite security reasons for not allowing residents back, even though IS was driven out of the area late last year. At the same time, the Kurds have repeatedly said they intend to incorporate the captured territory into their own self-rule zone  even as they plan a referendum for outright independence later this month. That raises questions over the future of Sunni Arab villages like Hassan Shami.Further south, Iranian-backed Shiite militias that captured mainly Sunni territory have also kept Sunnis from returning to strategic areas between Baghdad and the Iranian border or other areas Shiites consider vital.Sunni Arabs, meanwhile, are faced with the depth and magnitude of their plight. The fear among Iraqi authorities and the Sunnis themselves is that new militant groups could take root unless the community's situation is improved.Their cities and towns lie in partial ruins from the fight that drove IS out of most of the territories it seized in 2013 and 2014, from northern Iraq through the country's center and across the Sunni heartland of the western Anbar province. Thousands of Sunnis languish in detention for alleged links to the group.The community has suffered massive displacement. Currently, 3.2 million people are displaced, the overwhelming majority Sunni Arabs. Another more than 2 million were displaced previously but have since returned home, according to the International Organization of Migration. Together that would be a staggeringly high proportion of the country's entire Sunni Arab population, which is generally estimated to make up 15 to 20 percent of Iraq's 37 million people.Those who have returned  mainly to Anbar  must rebuild homes and communities, so far with little help from the government. Those still displaced either scramble to find housing or jobs or languish in camps. More than 400,000 of those displaced in nearly a year of fighting to liberate Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, are housed in 19 camps around the north.Sunni Arabs have struggled since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, which brought down Saddam Hussein and opened the door for the Shiite majority to gain power through elections. Sunnis were relegated to second-tier status, igniting an insurgency that brought years of violence and gave rise to al-Qaida and its successor, the Islamic State group. Over those years, divided Sunni politicians were ineffectual, and many Sunni professionals and businessmen left the country.Some Sunnis talk of trying to form their own self-rule region like Kurdistan. But many are wary, knowing the Sunni-majority areas have far fewer resources.""We Sunni Arabs are the weakest link in Iraq today. But trust me, this country will not be stable and strong again unless we assume a leading role in how the country is run,"" said Adnan Abu-Zeid, a school teacher from Mosul.But this kind of bravado masks a widespread despair.""Back in 2003, we wanted democracy and freedoms. Look where that got us,"" said an embittered Ghazi Hamad, displaced from Mosul. ""We have now lowered our expectations. Any government is good for us, as long as it makes us feel safe. We will happily live on the sidelines.""Hossam Ahmed, a 24-year-old student displaced from Mosul, spoke nostalgically of Saddam, though he would have only been 11 when the autocrat was ousted. ""I love Saddam Hussein. When he was in power, we, the people of Mosul, enjoyed full security,"" he said. ""Iraq was finished when he left.""In a sign of resignation and distrust of Shiites, some Sunni Arab tribal chiefs in the north are even publicly campaigning for their areas to join the Kurdish region. The Kurds are overwhelmingly Sunni, but suspicions and divisions run along ethnic lines with Sunni Arabs.The Baghdad government routinely says it wants the displaced to return, and official media celebrate when Sunni Arabs go back to their areas. Officials cite security concerns and lack of basic services as reasons why some do not return.But Sunnis worry over signs of forced demographic change in particular strategic areas.For example, Sunnis have had difficulty returning to parts of Diyala province, which borders both Iran and the Iraqi Kurdish autonomy zone.A recent IOM survey found that nearly 80 percent of Sunnis displaced from two sampled towns in Diyala had tried to return home but were prevented, whether by Kurdish forces or Shiite militiamen.Sheikh Iyad al-Laheibi, a local Sunni tribal chief, said he believes Shiite militias are engineering demographic changes in Diyala to secure a direct route from the Iranian border to Baghdad through the province.""Who gets to return home has become a random practice,"" al-Laheibi said. He also pointed to frequent kidnappings of the Sunnis who remain, believed to be aimed at intimidating them into leaving.In neighboring Salaheddin province, nearly half of those displaced from towns around the provincial capital Tikrit  Saddam's hometown  said they had been blocked from returning by Shiite militias, according to the IOM survey.Southwest of Baghdad, thousands of Sunni Arabs have been unable to return to Jurf al-Sakhar, a Sunni pocket in mainly Shiite Babel province that controls the gateway to the Shiite holy cities of Najaf and Karbala further south. Shiite militias drove IS militants from the area in 2014.Sunni politicians' repeated calls for Sunni residents to be allowed back have been ignored. Last month, the Babel provincial government threatened legal proceedings against anyone demanding their return.Infuriated Sunni lawmakers accused Babel of seeking to change the area's demographics. The U.N. said the Babel government was trying to intimidate politicians into silence.In Khazir camp, Fawaz Ahmed, once a Health Ministry employee, spoke of his secret trips back to his home in Hassan Shami village. Kurdish fighters guarding the village don't allow visits, so Ahmed and others obtain permits to leave the camp, ostensibly to visit relatives elsewhere, and then sneak into their homes.""My heart keeps telling me to go back and look,"" he said, squatting on a large rock at the edge of the camp facing his village. Below, in a ravine running parallel to the Khazir river, youths played soccer on dirt fields as the sky grew darker.""There is only one question on my mind: Why can't I go home?"" he said.In Irbil, Naseradeen Saeed Sindi, the Kurdish official in charge of ""Kurdistani areas outside the region,"" had no direct answer. He said security concerns prevent return for the moment. He also suggested that such captured areas would be made part of the Kurdish self-rule region.""Turkmen, Christians and Arabs will have rights equal to those enjoyed by the Kurds under the region's law,"" he said.In Khazir and other camps, residents languish, dealing with sizzling heat and long hours of boredom in tents lined up in monotonous rows. They talk longingly of ""awda""  Arabic for ""return.""""One's village is like his mother. You can never abandon her,"" said Ahmed Hassan Khalaf, another native of Hassan Shami and a father of 13 who is in his mid-70s and in poor health. ""We used to grow tomatoes on the land on which this camp is built,"" he said, grapping a fist-load of pebbles from the ground outside his tent.Then he murmured, barely audible in despair, ""Oh God, oh God the compassionate."""
5a112dd99855b76bf13dda95,Yuck or yum? Swiss offer insect burgers of mealworm larvae,http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2017/sep/11/yuck-or-yum-swiss-offer-insect-burgers-of-mealworm-larvae-1655390.html,2017-09-11,,The New Indian Express,"GENEVA: Swallow deeply, pinch the nose and repeat the mantra: ""Tastes like beef, tastes likes beef."" Then bite into the burger of rice, chopped vegetables, spices and mealworm larvae.The Swiss supermarket chain Coop, to a bit of domestic hoopla, has begun selling burgers and balls made from insects. It's being billed as a legal first in Europe, a continent more accustomed to steak, sausage, poultry and fish as a source of protein.The goal is to convince leery consumers to try a nutritious, if unusual food that ""preserves the planet's resources,"" Coop says.About one-third of the burger is mealworm larvae. A burger weighing 100 grams (3.5 ounces) has about 10 grams of protein in it  about the same amount found in a child's-size beef burger.For now, only seven of Coop's nearly 2,500 stores in Switzerland are serving up the critters concocted by the Zurich-based food startup Essento. The chain says the insect products have been flying off shelves during their limited rollout in the Alpine nation and a broader launch is planned by year's end.Insect promoters say Switzerland isn't the first European country to allow retail sales, just the first to have those sales so clearly authorized. A change in Swiss law in May allows the sale of three types of insects: mealworm larvae, house crickets and migratory locusts.""It's the first time that a state has authorized human consumption of insects in such a firm, explicit way in Europe,"" said Christophe Derrien, chief of the International Platform of Insects for Food and Feed.Insects can be found on the shelves in Belgium, Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands, but that's due to a ""legal void"" in European Union rules, he said.New legislation taking effect in January will smooth the way for bug burgers to turn up on picnic plates across the EU, however.The chain says it has a policy of not releasing sales numbers, but spokeswoman Andrea Bergmann said the insect burgers and balls ""have been very successful from day one and have been sold out quickly everywhere.""The burger itself has little white specks of rice inside with traces of carrot, paprika, chili powder and pepper. After a hesitant bite, the main flavors that come out are the spices. The texture is curious, a bit like a meaty falafel with a crunch. An aftertaste lingered  but maybe that was just my subconscious playing tricks.The insect burgers, like the meat variety, can be accompanied by buns, tomatoes and lettuce. The insect balls  a mixture of mealworms with cilantro, onions and chickpeas  seem to fit best in pita bread, perhaps with a spoonful of yogurt.The U.N.'s Food and Agricultural Organization has promoted insects as a source of human food, saying they are healthy and high in protein and minerals. The agency says many types of insects produce less greenhouse gases and ammonia than most livestock  such as methane-spewing cattle  and require less land and money to cultivate.Still, there's no telling how long a true conversion in consumer tastes from beef to bug burgers might take  if it happens at all."

Picture by Ashwinee Pati Bhubaneswar, Aug. 8: The state government today expressed its helplessness to contain the price of onion, which is now selling at Rs 30 a kg. ""The state produces only one-fourth of its onion requirement. Whatever onion has been produced this year in the state has been exhausted. Now, we are depending on other states such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh,"" food supplies and consumer welfare minister Surya Narayan Patro told The Telegraph. The government had announced on August 2 that it would make onion available at select outlets at Rs 17 a kg and had even threatened to take action against hoarders. It had said that the sellers should not charge more than Re 1 above the purchase price. ""There has been crop failure in Madhya Pradesh, while the crop has not been harvested in Andhra Pradesh. So it is not just Odisha, the entire country is depending on Maharashra at the moment. This crisis is not specific to Odisha. The entire country is facing the problem. At some places, onion is selling at Rs 35 a kg,"" said Patro. The minisyer said the purchase price at the source point was now between Rs 26,000 and Rs 27,000 a quintal. ""After taking the transport cost into account, the selling price in Odisha comes to around Rs 30 per kg,"" he said, adding that he had asked his department officials to sell onion at the government outlets at a price not above Rs 30 a kg. The rise in onion prices following the soaring price of tomato has hit the consumers hard. Last week, tomato was selling at between Rs 80 and Rs 100 a kg in the retail market. ""We have no role to play in the rise in onion price. The price of onion has increased at the source points,"" said secretary of Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda. Traders apprehend that the current high prices would continue till November. ""The winter crop from Nashik will reach the state in November. Besides, onions grown in various parts of the state will also enter the market in the winter and only then will the price stabilise,"" said Panda. Both farmers and traders said the state was suffering because of the lack of adequate cold storages. The state had witnessed distress sale of onions in March. However, the state government had attributed distress sale to over-production."

Ambur Biryani from the erstwhile princely state of Arcot is one of them. The biryani is especially in demand in the northern part of Tamil Nadu as well as parts of Karnataka around Bangalore city.Ambur, a small town in Tamil Nadu known for its leather industry, is located on the way to Bengaluru from Chennai close to Karnataka border. It is said that about a century ago, Hasin Baig, a bawarchi from the kitchens of the Nawab of Arcot relocated to his hometown Ambur and started preparing biryani there with a similar recipe as the Arcot biryani.While the biryani at Nawabs court was prepared in basmati rice, Baig started making his Ambur version for the masses using cheaper seeraga samba rice. The biryani (spelt briyani in Ambur) which was initially sold on bicycles, became so popular that a small shop was set up and people from even outside the town started to flock to this shop. Over the years, this recipe, now known as Ambur Biryani, has spread to parts of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu where it is hugely in demand. Bangalore and Chennai, for example, has many eateries offering this version of biryani.Apart from the variety of rice (seeraga samba rice is known as chitti mutyalu in Telangana), there are other differences Ambur Biryani has with its Hyderabadi counterpart. The meat here is cooked before putting the biryani on dum, and tomatoes are used frequently in the recipe. Also, in the biryani more of spices like cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and green chillies are used yet it is not as spicy as the Hyderabadi variety. Moderate use of tomatoes, coriander and mint leaves gives a uniform colour to the dish.While preparing Ambur biryani, the meat is first pre-cooked with onions, ginger, garlic, tomatoes, curd and whole spices. Separately cooked rice and this meat are then layered in a degh and topped with ghee before putting on dum. In some places the rice and meat are mixed together instead of layering. The biryani is preferably eaten with an eggplant gravy known as kathirikal pachidi.In Hyderabad, a small place in the bylanes of Madhura Nagar near Ameerpet is perhaps the only place serving Ambur Biryani. Pondy Parottas is a 12-seater eatery run by Raja Subbiah and Judith May, a couple from Pondicherry. Known for its Tamilian and Sri Lankan parottas, the outlet introduced Ambur Biryani about a year back and since then there has been no looking back. According to Raja, Ambur Biryani has become the fastest selling dish drawing a steady flow of local customers. He offers variants of this biryani in chicken, mutton kheema, and prawns. Enthused by the response he is planning to start his second outlet in Hi-Tec City soon. Sabyasachi is a food enthusiast and blogs at www.foodaholix.in"

With Bakrid preceding Thiruvonam by two days, on September 1, the trade fairs too began slightly earlier this year, aimed at tapping into the demand of the twin celebrations. ""At a time when the prices of essential commodities are increasing in the general market, the trade fairs really are a boon to the common man; they could aptly be termed 'the people's market',"" said K V Thomas MP, speaking after launching the Onam Trade Fair set up by Supplyco on the Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium premises in Kaloor.Thomas said agencies like Supplyco play a key role in preventing the price hike of essential goods. ""There was a time when wholesale traders use to collect goods from FCI warehouses. But most of them would in turn keep the stock in their own godowns, resulting in increasing number of cases related with the hoarding of goods. They later sell these goods in the black market. This prompted the then government to introduce the Food Safety Bill.This helped government agencies like Supplyco play a major role in providing supplies to the common man,"" said Thomas. The MP said the government is taking a favourable stance towards Supplyco godowns. ""Supplyco should use these favourable conditions for the benefit of consumers,"" said Thomas. ""A new programme named Karshakamithram, mooted to attract more students towards agriculture, will be launched in schools soon. One lakh curry leaf saplings will be distributed on September 11.""THE HIGHS AND LOWS OF ONAMKochi: Every year, the weeks leading up to Onam season are marked by the soaring prices of vegetables. This year, with only about a two week-countdown left for the festival, it is not easy to assess the price trend in the market. Some of the essential vegetables are priced high, but the prices of others, which hit an all time high last month, have come down. For instance, the price of shallots saw a record high price of D140 per kg in July. This month, however, it has come down to D85 per kg. The main reason for the price hike in shallots was the drought in Tamil Nadu from where the produce reaches Kerala. Now, the wholesalers are getting more supply from Andhra Pradesh which is reflected in the reduced price, said N Rajan, a vendor in Kaloor market.However, customers complain vegetables sold cheaply in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka become costly when they cross the border into Kerala. The price increases three or four fold when it reaches here, said Prasanth Jacob, a customer. Raw banana costs only D30 per kg in Coimbatore. However, a customer here has to pay a minimum of D70. Likewise, tomato which is available for D15 per kg in Tamil Nadu gets a weightier price tag here, costing D60 to D70 per kg. The other items that witness a hike in price in August are beetroot, amaranthus, beans, cow pea and drumstick. The price of green chilly and carrot have reduced slightly. ""The prices were fluctuating during the first two weeks of August. However, it is likely to go up by the end of this month, added Rajan.The where and when of fairsSupplyco fairs will be organised in all taluks in Ernakulam. Essential commodities, including red chilly, coriander, black beans, bengal gram, tur dal and vegetables will be available at prices lower than the market price.

And it seems the airline companies have finally understood this universal truth.All the companies are scrambling their menu cards to provide their customers with the ultimate food experience as they fly towards their destinations. The cuisine being offered range from the oriental, continental etc to the local flavours.Among the airlines, Kochi-headquartered Air India Express has gone the extra mile and are giving their passengers the choicest of Malabar food, mainly Malabari poratta and chicken curry from their customised ala carte.Air India Express claims they are the only company in the country which serves complimentary snacks, both the veg and non-veg variety, in the domestic and international routes.We have added varieties like Malabar chicken, meen vattichathu, poratta and chicken to our lunch and dinner menus. These dishes can be ordered only online up to 24 hours prior to the departure of the flight. Bar snacks and starters such as chicken tangri kebab with mint chutney, chicken 65 and chicken nuggets with tomato ketchup rosemary chicken with caramelized onion in multi cereal roll and jeera rice served alongside butter paneer and aloo gobi with salad and gulab jamun are potential enough to tickle the taste buds of passengers, said the spokesperson of the AIE.AIEs inclusion of non-vegetarian dishes in its menu assumes significance considering the fact that Air India, the parent company of AIE, had recently discontinued the supply of these dishes in the economy class its domestic flights as part of cost cutting. The national carrier had also been in news a couple of times for mixing up veg and non-veg orders.According to a report tabled in the Parliament by the Civil Aviation Ministry officials, Air India had mixed up orders three times. Also, the airline had received as many as 44, 27 and 48 complaints in the last three years, regarding the quality of food and catering service. The multiple complaints forced the airline to take appropriate action against the caterer as per the contractual terms.Cost cutting measuresAir India stopped serving non-vegetarian meals in the economy class of its domestic flights as part of cost cutting measures. It also launched various cost cutting measures like a change in menu, meal schedule, rationalisation of dry stores and ancillary items as per current trends.The annual savings which are expected to be made from these measures is Rs 20 crore, said the officials while replying to a query. The annual savings from the discontinuation of non-vegetarian meals in the economy class of Air India domestic flights are expected to be around Rs 8 to Rs 10 crore, said Ministry. Apart from saving cost, it will reduce wastage, improve service and also prevent any chances of mix-ups.This doesnt mean the national carrier is dragging its feet in improvising the airline menu. The airline company has taken steps to improve its catering services by introducing new improved menu, doing away with food items not preferred by passengers, has began training chefs at its international stations on Indian cuisine, taking up passenger and crew feedbacks with the caterers aggressively and monitoring the quality or presentation of meal service closely and making surprise visits to the caterers often. Further, follow ups will be taken for rectifications if a deficiency in the caterers service is noticed, said officials.Local flavours a hitAround 95 per cent of air passengers from Kerala prefer to have local dishes onboard, said Gunasekaran Chandrasekaran, chief chef with Casino Air-caterers and Flight Services, Kochi.Today airlines are putting more emphasis on including as many deshi dishes as possible in their menu. And there has been a good feedback regarding the local cuisine. We have received orders from three major airlines to provide special Onam dishes for its flights to Kerala, he said.Though he refused to disclose the dishes since the airlines are planning the menu as a surprise for their passengers, a senior AIE officer said those flying with Air India Express will be greeted with a special Kerala sweet dish onboard the flight.Experts associated with the flight kitchens also maintain there has been a considerable increase in foreigners who visit the state and nearly all of them prefer to savour the best of the local flavour."
5a1150e19855b76bf13df594,Congress lines up oil 'loot' protests,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170916/jsp/nation/story_173499.jsp,2017-09-16,,Telegraph,"New Delhi, Sept. 15: The Congress has lined up a nationwide campaign against rising prices of petroleum products and food items, accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of squeezing money out of the common man's pocket to fill up government coffers. While there will be a demonstration at Jantar Mantar in Delhi on September 20, at least 10 lakh signatures will be collected for a memorandum to be submitted to the Prime Minister. The signatures will be collected from people at petrol pumps for three days from Sunday. All Congress state units have been asked to devise their own programmes against the rising prices of petroleum products and food items like onions, tomatoes, some pulses and other vegetables. While onion and tomato prices have shot past Rs 50 a kg, some pulses are selling at over Rs 100 per kg even as arhar prices crashed after crossing Rs 200 last year. Congress leader Ajay Maken said at a news conference today: ""If petrol or food items sell at higher prices because of unavoidable circumstances, we can understand. But this government indulges in profiteering by looting ordinary citizens. Petroleum products are a case in point. The domestic prices have soared as international crude oil rates have gone down."" Maken added: ""While the government has given absurd reasons like 'Hurricane Harvey and Irma' for the increase in petrol and diesel prices, it has dealt a devastating blow to the savings of the common people by increasing central excise 11 times in the past three and a half years - 133.47% on petrol and 400.86% on diesel. The government has also robbed 18.11 crore LPG consumers by increasing the prices of subsidised cylinders by Rs 75 in the past three years."" Pointing out that international crude oil prices have come down more than 52 per cent since the Modi government took over on May 26, 2014, Maken said: ""If you take petrol of Rs 100, Rs 51.78 is going to the government in the form of taxes. In diesel worth Rs 100, Rs 44.40 is tax. This is dacoity. Which government punishes citizens to make up for its own (revenue) shortfall caused by wrong economic policies? This is not only insensitive, this is loot."" Maken declared that the Congress ""shall fight this battle to reduce taxes on every available forum"". ""We dare the BJP to come out with a white paper on taxes on fuel and the total gains. The Congress demands immediate withdrawal of excessive central excise duties and other taxes."" Maken stressed that the government had adopted a devious strategy to mislead people by raising prices in small instalments. ""18.11 crore customers purchase subsidised gas cylinders every month. The government decided to increase the price of every cylinder by Rs 4 every month until the subsidy is wiped out. In the last three years, the hike on a gas cylinder was Rs 75. This is done when international price is so low. The UPA government was paying a subsidy of Rs 449 per cylinder to provide relief to the common citizen."""

A long break in rain has heightened prospects of soya crop failure and portends a big trouble for farmers reeling under heavy debt.In past one year, they faced back to back losses, notwithstanding bumper crops of orange and onion. Post-demonetisation, onion was sold for Re 1 before the government stepped in. ""The government woke up too late and started procuring onion at a rate of Rs 8 per kg. By the time the procurement started, thousands of farmers had already sold lakhs of tonnes of onion,"" said farmers in Agar Malwa bitterly.""It should rain soon or the soya crop may damage,"" they said. The district in western MP is known for producing good quality orange, onion and soyabean. Grown over almost 50,000 acres of land, orange crop was hit by demonetisation when traders did not turn up to buy the produce. Availability of onion at dirt cheap rate dealt another blow to growers.Poor rain in the district led to stunted growth of the soya crop. This is happening when many farmers are under debtfrom Rs 1 to Rs3 lakhdepending on the land area under cultivation.A farmer, Roop Narayan is trying hard to save his soya crop. Narayan, who sowed soya between rows of orange plants on 10 bighas of land, says, ""I incurred a loss of Rs 1.5 lakh after spending Rs 3 lakh on onion crop. I had no other option, but to borrow more money from the cooperative societies. I am just praying nothing goes wrong this time.""He said the government should have ""reacted early"" to procure onions from farmers. The decision was taken after more than 15 days, he said. Another farmer Devi Singh could get barely Rs 90,000 by selling onion at Rs 2/ kg. He said the government, which talks a lot about the farmers, should actually do something concrete for them.Jain Singh, another farmer of the region, says, ""We need warehouses for onion and yields like tomato and orange cultivated in the region.""Minister for agriculture Gaurishankar Bisen, however, said, "" Onion procurement benefited 99% farmers.

However, there was disinflation in the food basket.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which factors in CPI for arriving at its monetary policy, had earlier this month slashed the key interest rate (repo rate) by 25 basis points to 6%.Separately, skyrocketing tomato prices propelled inflation at the wholesale level to 1.88% in July from 0.9% in June, with the food category overall contributing significantly to the uptick in WPI terms.Inflation in the food segment of the primary articles category in July came in at 2.15%, snapping a two-month contraction. Within this, the fruits and vegetables segment contributed the most, with inflation coming in at 29%.Seasonal, temporaryTomatoes witnessed blistering inflation of more than 209% in July, compared with a contraction of 29.4% in June, according to data with the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). Brinjal, too, witnessed a sharp acceleration in inflation to 21.1% in July, from the previous months contraction of 3.1%. Okra ( Bhindi ) saw inflation at 32.4%.What we have to recognise is that these are seasonal influences and are therefore temporary in nature, D.K. Srivastava, chief policy advisor at EY India, said. We must look at core WPI inflation and see if there are any factors pushing it up. Otherwise, this increase will subside shortly. As far as fuel is concerned, there has not been any significant movement in crude oil prices, so that wouldnt put any pressure in either direction, Mr. Srivastava said.The index for Food Articles group rose by 6.2%... due to higher price of fruits and vegetables (29%), peas/chawali (6%), ragi (4%) and condiments & spices, barley, poultry chicken and paddy (1% each), the government said in its release.

5a127ca29855b76bf13e0a61,On a cool jaunt inside an eco-friendly house,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/on-a-cool-jaunt-inside-an-eco-friendly-house/articleshow/60145034.cms,2017-08-21,,The Times Of India,"A cool breeze ruffling your hair on a scorching afternoon in Chennai... not even a fairy tale will ever begin like this. But what if this was a reality? Well, it is, at this four-decade-old, eco-friendly house on Vasu Street, Kilpauk, that runs on solar panels and biogas, follows rainwater harvesting, and grows fresh green vegetables on its terrace-cum-kitchen garden. The terrace is so lush, that you can hear birds chirping even on a hot, still afternoon, and the rustling leaves ensure a cool breeze all day long. That the house belongs to the 73-year-old revolutionary, D Suresh , popularly known as 'Solar Suresh', is the secret here. Suresh, popular across India for his efforts to 'green up' the country, grown eggplants, tomatoes, ridge gourd, lemons, ginger, curry leaves, mint, broad beans, green chillies, radish, cauliflowers, beans, potatoes and bittergourd on his roof. And after successfully implementing all his natural resources project, the man is now ready to come up with a wastewater recycling project that will be capable of treating toilet, household, bathroom and kitchen wastewater into safe potable water right in his home.""It all started when I got to travel to Germany 20 years ago. It stunned me when I saw every house having its own rooftop solar plant. This left me thinking, if a country like Germany, that has a little sunshine, is successfully living on solar energy, why can't a big country like India? Especially if you look at Chennai, we have sunlight throughout the year, imagine how much energy we could produce and utilise in the areas where there is no electricity at all,"" begins Suresh.The IIT-Madras and IIM-Ahmedabad graduate, after working for 18 years in a company that manufactured auto electrical components, decided to give shape to his innovative idea all by himself  at his home. The first move was to approach major companies in Chennai for sponsorship, but none showed any interest. So, he decided to walk down the path all by himself. Says Suresh, ""I'm not a businessman and we need to stop looking at this as 'Return-on-Investment'.""Do you think twice before splurging on movies, shopping or partying? He believes this is one investment that has a larger impact. ""There are many misconceptions about installing solar panels. People think these do not work when it rains, and changing the mindset of people to get them to adapt to this lifestyle change is a major challenge. To prove all the misconceptions wrong and present a successful project to the public, I decided to do it myself. I want to eradicate the problem of solid waste management and if we all install biogas, half of garbage dumping problems will be gone soon,"" he shares.So far, he has installed around 40 solar panels and biogas plants in Chennai, Hyderabad and Bengaluru in various schools, residential areas, old-age homes, hospitals and factories. He works closely with three local vendors who help him set up solar panels, biogas plants and kitchen garden in houses, schools and commercial areas. He ensures that he inspects the places before and after the installation.Suresh installed 1 kilowatt (kW) solar power plant at his home in January 2012, and later in June 2015, he added 2 kWs. In his independent home, everything  from fan, tubelights, computer, mixer-grinder, washing machine, water pump and TV  runs on solar energy. ""I only pay around `600 as my electricity bill for AC and the inverter. Solar plants depend on the UV rays of the sun and not the intensity of the heat. So, even during rains, or when it is drizzling, the UV rays are available. It works perfectly fine during monsoons, too,"" he says witha smile.The simple and low-maintenance method of resource optimisation required `40,000 as a one-time investment in setting up a 1 cubic meter biogas plant that can process about 10kg of waste each day to produce around 40kg of gas per month. Biogas plant requires organic waste like cooked, uncooked, leftover food, vegetable peels, spoilt vegetables and fruits. Suresh collects these from his home, neighbourhood and nearby vegetable shops and hotels. The organic waste is fed to the plants in his kitchen garden as manure. About 20 years ago, he installed an organic filtration tank in his house. ""The rainwater is collected from the terrace and is purified through the organic filtration plant. It is completely potable; the plant consists of layers of pebbles, charcoal and sand. The water can be stored and used for various purposes in our house,"" he explains.Suresh starts his day in his garden  he can be seen with gardening tools in his hands, scraping the manure he prepares with coco peat and sand in equal proportions. ""I am keeping the dry leaves on the top of the soil to retain the moisture  it is called mulching,"" he tells us, and continues doing what he loves the most  gardening and in turn, help saving the nature."

Prices will only increase as Onam approaches, he said.Sadasivan Sugathan, who runs a beauty parlour near the airport, said he bought bananas fewer times a week than earlier.It is not possible to eliminate it altogether because children have to be given fruits as part of their diet. Prices are likely to keep going up in the days to come, he said.A vegetable vendor said he was forced to make do with small-sized rasa kadali from the Chala maret as the average-sized ones were not to be got from the market. Another vendor said the palayamkodan variety was hard to come by.Abdul Rashid, a wholesale dealer at the Chala market, said the wholesale rate was around Rs. 70-74 a kg for nendran.In short supplyThe supply of Wayanad variety of nendran that had been reaching the market for the past couple of months had nearly stopped.We have some stock and are selling it for Rs. 64, he said.A retail vendor in the Chala market said the matti variety of banana used for payasams and other desserts cost Rs. 200 a kg.Even raw plaintain cost Rs. 50 for half a kg, another vendor said.At a Horticorp outlet at Poojappura, the nendran variety cost Rs. 80, and rasa kadali, Rs. 110 a kg. Palayamkodan, which usually could be bought for Rs. 30 a kg, was priced at Rs. 50 a kg.The vendor said once the government intervened in the market in time for Onam, the prices would come down in the open market too."

Road, in Malleswaram and other areas.The KSPCB had first banned PoP idols and their immersion in waterbodies in 2014. The ban was reintroduced in 2016, but stating a delay in communication, idol makers approached KSPCB with a plea to permit sale of idols that had already been manufactured. The KSPCB temporarily relaxed the ban on the condition that the idols be scientifically disposed. It reiterated that a complete ban would come into effect this year.Lakshman, chairman, KSPCB, told The Hindu , The board had directed the BBMP and other municipal corporations to ensure that the ban is followed in letter and spirit.

As citizen representatives, we recommended placing boards at waterbodies stating that immersion of PoP idols will not be allowed. Except near Yediyur lake, this has not been done anywhere else. With PoP idols already making it to the markets, we foresee lake pollution this year as well.An eco-friendly messageAround 150 civic leaders trained by Bangalore Political Action Committee (B.PAC) have been conducting awareness programmes in their respective neighbourhoods. Apart from this, we are conducting make your own clay Ganesh workshops in 20 wards. We have already covered 11 wards, including B.T.M. Layout, Koramangala, Shanthinagar, K.R. Puram, and made around 2,500 clay idols. In the next two days, we will be covering the remaining wards, said Sushma Mahabala, programme head, B.PAC, which has roped in artists from Karnataka Chitrakala Parishad to conduct the workshop.From Ganesh to a plantA Ganesh that grows into a plant remains a popular eco-friendly innovation. Sasya Ganapathi, a company started by four friends this year, has created and sold 1,000 such Ganeshs.Ganesh Chathurti is something that most people celebrate. We thought we could spread a green message through the festival. Thus was born Sasya Ganapathi, says co-founder Bharath Srinivas.The kit includes a 1 ft clay Ganesh idol, which is filled with fertiliser and a potting mix. Pot and seeds are provided separately.After the festival, people can immerse the idol in the pot. When it dissolves, the fertiliser mixes with the soil, following which seeds can be added. We offer tulsi, ladies finger and tomato seeds, said Mr. Srinivas. A year of experimenting preceded the launch of the product.Another start-up  GrowShareSustain  has come out with a similar concept where a clay Ganesh idol is a seed ball. After the festival, the idol can be immersed in a container. As the idol dissolves, the seed balls merge into the clay and soil. With enough sunlight and water, saplings will sprout within a week."

The reason? All kinds of veggies required for Onam, whether it be tomato, ladies finger, chilly, brinjal, cucumber or varieties of spinach, are ready for harvest at their own vegetable garden, located in their office complex!The initiative, launched by the secretariat officials under the agriculture department's scheme Onathinu Oru Muram Pachakkari , envisages mass cultivation of organic vegetables. And, it has turned the secretariat officials, including seniors, into 'green volunteers'. The small stretch of land near the Durbar Hall at Kerala Government Secretariat complex has around 500 grow bags while more than a 1000 grow bags have been placed on the terrace of the secretariat annexe-II building complex.But it is not just about the vegetables but also about the joy of farming, says Satheeja VR, convener of the Kerala Secretariat Employees Association Vanitha subcommittee. ""The majority of the employees working here in the various sections are not Thiruvananthapuram natives. We live in rented apartments or houses and don't get the time or space for cultivation. But the sight of the tender vegetables sprouting from the grow bags set makes our day,"" says Satheeja.During breaks, plants are the subject of discussion. ""The main enemies of vegetables are the green caterpillars, which eat the leaves. I used to squash them with my fingers while tending the plants. The employees were disgusted with that but now they are so concerned about the plants that they have started to do it themselves. Agriculture minister VS Sunil Kumar has been our greatest support,"" says N Suresh Kumar, secretariat garden supervisor.The first harvest, of the vegetables planted a month earlier, was in the first week of August. ""We put up an organic vegetable counter at the secretariat garden office, which opens at 4 pm every day. Public have to pre-book if they want to buy the fresh organic veggies from the secretariat garden. We sell them in small vegetable kits, at nominal prices. The next harvest, including that of leafy vegetables, will be done in the coming weeks,"" adds Suresh.The employees have formed an active social media group named 'green volunteers'. Suresh says, ""The group has around 100 members, and they share photos of the veggies grown in their houses, while some post queries on pest attacks. Instant remedies are suggested!""Organic farming is also a means by which government employees can exercise their social responsibility, observes Kerala Secretariat Employees Association general secretary M S Bijukuttan . ""It sends out a message to the public to make organic farming part of their lives. We have kept a vithupetti or seed box which anyone can access. We consider this a beginning to re-establish the farming culture and to make available safe-to-eat vegetables,"" Bijukuttan says."
5a12cebb9855b76bf13e1d9b,We’ll double biz here in 7 yrs: Unilever CEO,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/well-double-biz-here-in-7-yrs-unilever-ceo/articleshow/60454612.cms,2017-09-11,,The Times Of India,"Mumbai: Paul Polman , the global CEO of Euro 52.7 billion Unilever belongs to a rare breed of leaders who believes in inclusive capitalism . The two are inseparable for him. He talks about sustainability and growing the business with equal zeal. Seven years ago, when he visited India and set a target of doubling the business while halving the environment footprint, it was considered audacious. Ask him for a scorecard and he is happy to share the numbers. Unilever's Indian subsidiary, Hindustan Unilever HUL ) has doubled its business during this period, while also delivering on some of the goals on inclusion, which are more long term and moving.But Polman, a Dutchman who previously worked with Nestle and Procter & Gamble, believes there's enough to be done. The Rs 35,000-crore maker of Dove soaps and Surf Excel detergent , in which Unilever holds 67%, looks for an encore.""I am prudently confident of the opportunity to double our business in India in the next 7 years. What we have done in the past 7-8 years is created the same business of what we have created in the previous 100-plus years. Now we are going to do that again. We think the country gives us that opportunity and, actually, we are part of creating that opportunity. So it's a wonderful symbiosis,"" Polman tells TOI, in an exclusive interview, amid a hectic schedule that included visits to consumers in some of Mumbai's slum areas, business review meetings and a town hall for Leverites at the FMCG major's head office based in the western suburbs.While Polman appears to be satisfied with HUL's performance, nagging competition from new players like Patanjali Ayurved has forced the FMCG giant to become more reactive. It hurriedly launched a full range of Ayush in nine months  from conceptualisation stage to national launch  in an attempt to stop Patanjali in its tracks.Couldn't HUL have been more proactive? ""If Ford knew what the car would do to a horse buggy, he would have introduced it earlier,"" says Polman, exhibiting a rather nonchalant demeanour. ""It's not important to be first, it's important to be right. All I see is making it big. Our business has doubled. We clearly saw priorities and we had opportunities in tea, ice cream, food, personal care and home care. We have had a great run to create another Hindustan Unilever. We are not dissatisfied the way the business went. Ayush has good potential in India.""There couldn't be a better endorsement for the newly launched Ayush toothpaste. Polman is a new convert and has taken back tubes of Ayush toothpaste which he sampled while in Mumbai. To that extent, Polman chuckles, he's already taking the brand ""global"". ""But we need to build the brand (Ayush) here where there is so much potential. If we see the success here, I have no doubt other countries will pick up on that. Pureit (an Indian innovation in water purifier) is a big brand in China and it's getting into other countries as well,"" says Polman.Local innovations certainly excite Polman who believes those days where consumer trends could be picked up from US and Europe to predict what would happen in markets like India, are gone.""Innovation can come from anywhere and usually from developing markets because people are more entrepreneurial here. There's also a younger population outside Europe and US. In China, the internet is far advanced than in the US. In India, Ayurveda is taking off and is an enormous opportunity. These markets are much quicker to leap frog to the best and often premium products. Here, hair care is moving towards premium more than developed markets,"" he says.On Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP), Polman says it's on track. ""If you look at our business (Unilever global), the hard numbers our share price and our returns to shareholders have been three times in this period of nine years. So our USLP is well on track and delivering on the stretched targets that we have set for ourselves. We have over half of our materials that are now sourced sustainably, 100% of tomatoes in India and about 45% of our tea is sourced sustainably, all of our factories are zero waste and we are moving quite rapidly to green energy. I think for many of these aspects because we had set ambitious goals, we have made a difference.""However, Polman, who came close to becoming a priest before he plunged into the depths of the business world, claims he is no oracle of Delphi. But some of his predictions have been bang on. When he took over as CEO of the Anglo-Dutch multinational in 2009, the developed markets were reeling under a recession. He then said 75% of Unilever's growth would come from market development, 75% will come from personal care and that developing and emerging (D&E) markets would contribute 75% to Unilever's turnover by 2020. Of these, Polman has managed to get the first two predictions right. But D&E markets are still at 60% of Unilever's turnover.""The reality is, actually more of our growth has come from the emerging markets because Europe and US have not performed that well. I was hoping we would have 75% of our business in emerging market in ten years - so I still have about 2-3 years to go on that. But we are at 60% despite having done M&A activity in developed markets (Alberto Culver, Dollar Shave club, Seventh Generation). We made these acquisitions to increase our footprint in Europe and US. If you take those acquisitions out, we would be higher than 60% (D&E percentage of total),"" he says.With weakening currency and other economic factors, emerging markets began to feel the pressure and slowed down. But the goal remains the same. ""Since 80% of the population is going to live outside of Europe and US, the bulk of the growth will come from the D&E markets. We will have the bulk of our business in D&E. When I started, D&E was 45% and now it's at 60%. You will see urbanisation continuing to be a driver in developing markets. So if we do our jobs well, we will definitely have 75% of our business in ten years in D&E,"" says Polman.Altruism comes naturally to Polman. In a world where CEO salaries are only going northwards, Polman's has remained unchanged. He believes leaders shouldn't work for money.""The moment I came into the company, I made it clear to my board that despite Unilever results, I don't want to get paid more. The reality is since I joined the company 9 years ago, I have the same salary. I get paid enough and have a great lifestyle. Salary for me is not a driver. Contrary to what people think that CEOs work harder if they get paid more is a load of baloney. All CEOs when they become CEOs already have enough money to retire. So we are volunteers,"" says Polman, who turned 61 this year and talks about his retirement have already begun.Will his successor continue with the same strategy? Polman, who had succeeded Patrick Cescau, who first talked about 'brand imprint', is not worried about USLP (Unilever Sustainable Living Plan), which he says, is by now ingrained in the DNA of Unilever. ""From the moment I joined this company, I had to think about succession. We have a much stronger bench and team leaders. We have people here like Sanjiv (Sanjiv Mehta, MD & CEO, HUL) who have incredibly challenging assignments. We have a cadre of people who could step into my job any time and continue to do successful things,"" he says.He, however, holds on to his strong views and rejects business models meant merely for ""a few billionaires"". This year, Polman successfully staved off a surprise $143-billion bid by US food company Kraft Heinz , controlled by billionaire Warren Buffet and private equity firm 3G Capital, to acquire Unilever.He believes business can actively make a positive contribution to society. ""Unfortunately, we have too many businesses only staying around now for shorter terms. The average length of a publicly traded company in the US is 17 years. It used to be 60 years,"" says Polman. The reason, according to him, is because they are just narrowly focused on shareholder and have totally forgotten what it is all about.""I would hope, as I move on, that people would say that Unilever is a model that shows business can be run differently. That it doesn't have to be to the benefit of a few, that its value and values is to the benefit of the billions and not billionaires, that you can have business play a key role in creating a sustainable and more equitable world, that business can play a key role in alleviating poverty,"" says Polman, who personally went to the White House to convince them to be part of the Paris climate deal.""We didn't succeed but I would have felt worse had we not tried,"" he says."

He made nearly Rs. 10 lakh in four months. I have harvested a bumper yield of 43 tonnes and am expecting another 8 to 10 tonnes from the remaining crop, which is a record in this region, says Mr. Sunil, whose mantra in farming is determination and application of scientific practices.In honour of his success the Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR) organised a field demonstration day at his farm to popularise scientific methods of cultivation of this high-yielding variety.IIHRs Vegetable Division Head A.T.

Travelling from one place to another means arriving in the particular culinary pleasures offered by that destination, but it also means that a new sector of deprivation opens up simultaneously. If you happen to be visiting somewhere for a short period, then this is fine: you enjoy the local foodings in all their pomp and peculiarity, and then you move on before the lack of this or that makes itself felt. The problem arises when you go somewhere for a stretch, say, for a couple of months, and bits of your taste-bud operating system begin to experience small glitches.Within India, coming home to Calcutta, I can find some of the best variations of north Indian dishes, the vegetarian items as well as the biryanis, kebabs and the meat and chicken gravy dishes, but I can never find the perfect naan or lachha parantha that I get in Delhi or its environs. Vice versa, there was no question of getting decent Bangla food in either Delhi or Bombay, barring enclaves like Chittaranjan Park. This much is easy to understand: while some taste-things manage to travel from their home base, others dont. While some foods drop roots (including supply chains for ingredients that need to be brought from the original territory), others find it impossible (example, think how idli-dosai have become equally authentic all over India).Half a mealThe next thing thats also more or less understandable is what happens when you carry with you some precious food to eat far away from its point of origin. So, you come home to your warm tropical city and quickly refrigerate the four kinds of French cheese youve brought back. You call friends over, they bring wine, bread, crackers, and you open the cheese. There is the pleasure of serving and eating foodstuff that are once again rare, but theres something missing. Maybe its the exact bread that goes with the cheese or maybe its the taste of the wine, but you end up feeling that youve had a sort of half or three-quarters meal, with bits missing in the middle.Flip it around and things abroad can get similarly strange. There is the well-worn joke which starts with the question, Hey, where do you get the best Indian food in Paris? The answer goes: Head for Gare du Nord, take a Eurostar train to London Kings Cross, come out and turn right. Drummond Street with its desi eating joints is right there. Paris may have some of the best food in the world, but a cosmopolitan hub of international cuisine it is not, especially as far as affordable subcontinental food is concerned. If Paris is lacking in this regard, Berlin is even worse. The city is now full of boards proclaiming Indisches Restaurant, but if youre a desi, you want to avoid most of these. Spending some time in Berlin, I got lucky: around the corner from where I was staying was a small Indian restaurant run by a Bangladeshi man who spoke fluent, idiomatic Hindi. We struck up a cordial relationship and my friend would make sure the dishes he served me and my companions were as fresh and non-industrial as possible. While far from great desi khana , coupled with my own cooking this was good enough to tide over my home food cravings.Germany, a cornucopia of foodHowever, as I kept sternly reminding myself, I wasnt in Berlin to miss Indian food. Germany has some of the best bread, great cheese and sausages, and, along with the Czechs and Belgians, simply the best beer on the planet. Besides, the huge Turkish presence means a wealth of doner and kebap shops; other West Asian and Asian populations provide a whole variety of reasonably priced non-European grub. Added to this, there are, of course, the usual suspects of variously priced burger joints and purveyors of pizza and pasta. If you want a change from the beer, European and non-European wine is widely available at much cheaper prices than in the U.K. and certainly back home. All in all, Berlin (and a couple of other parts of Germany that I visited) is a cornucopia of food and drink. Nevertheless, after nearly two months, I began to feel some some sense of missing that I couldnt quite place.Coming back from Berlin to London, one of the first things I found myself buying were sandwiches from the supermarket: egg and cress, bacon, lettuce, and tomato, and even the very Germanpastramiandsauerkraut. Among the first places in which I found myself eating out were my favourite pizza joints. Despite coming from one of the worlds best pork-producing countries, I found myself loading packets of English bacon for breakfast at home. Soon, I will come away from all this foreign food. At home await both ghastly pizza delivery fraudsters and the wonderfully chilli-hot Chinese sausages from Kalimpong, both extortionately priced Indian wine and the winter gifts of sarson ka saag and missi roti , both the crap psuedo Chinese and Thai food and Gujju Bajri no rotlo and gawl (gur) and the Bong luchi and kosha maangsho . No doubt after a month of so of quaffing aloo parantha in Delhi, or idli-dosai all over the home country, Ill find myself double missing the sandwiches in London and the lovely, dark bread, cheese and salami in Berlin."

I can imagine what her dining table would look like  laden with some of the best known dishes of Bengal, from fish and mutton preparations, to fries and cutlets, stuffed vegetables and chutneys.Being a card-holding feminist  let me remind new readers that I protested in front of a Miss India pageant many years ago  I do not belong to that school of thought which states that the best chefs are always men. Though some of my best friends are men who cook, and rather well, I hold with high regard women who have been cooking delicious stuff  and writing about it, too. Consider all these names from Bengal  Bunny Gupta, Jaya Chaliha, Minakshie Das Gupta, Chitrita Banerjee, Satarupa Banerjee. I rely on their books whenever I want to try out something interesting from Bengal.And now I think I need to get some recipes out of Iti Aunty, who is based in Kolkata and is known to wield a mean ladle. I had a special thaala  thats thaali in Bengali  curated by her at the Monkey Bar the other evening, and have been licking my fingers ever since. The festival  on from tomorrow (September 24) to September 30  is a Puja special that also seeks to celebrate what is called pate puja in Bengal, or worshipping the stomach.I am, as you know, very fond of the Monkey Bar. The CP outlet has shut down, but the one in the Vasant Kunj Market is so full of life that I feel years younger whenever I am there. Theres loud music, no doubt, but the lights that glitter from funky chandeliers, the great menu and the friendly staff all make for a very happy meal.And I had a very, very happy meal when I was invited to try out Iti Auntys Pujor Special Thaala. There are three kinds of platters on offer  with fish (Rs. 1299 plus taxes), with chicken (Rs. 1199 plus taxes), and vegetarian (Rs. 999 plus taxes). Every thaala has in common aloor dom, a Bengali variation of dum aloo, flavoured with cumin and other spices, begun kasundi, which is an eggplant dish with a sharp mustard flavour, plastic chutney, cooked with raw papayas, and tomato chutney.I opted for the fish thhaala which also included fish kachori, bhoona khichri with fried mourola fish, steamed prawns wrapped in pumpkin leaves, fish cutlet and kamala bhetki. Each one was delicious.The gravy in the kamala bhetki was lightly flavoured with oranges, so it was mildly sweet, as Bengali food can be. The prawns were sharp with mustard and the fish cutlet  with mashed boneless fish mixed with potato, crumbed and fried  was just right.I have had various kinds of kachoris, or Bengali kochuris, but the fish kochuri was one of a kind, with a filling of mashed bhetki. The kachori, soft and puffy like a puri, was absolutely superb. I enjoyed the khichri immensely, too. It had been cooked with the fragrant gobindo bhog rice and moong dal, flavoured with ghee and topped with fried onions and fried mourala fish.Mourala is a small fish that I think is best eaten when fried with just a coating of salt, chillies and turmeric. Here they had put a besan batter around the fish. The problem with the fish is that it has to be eaten fresh off the kadhai, because if kept out for a while, it goes limp in this weather.The kasundi  a strong and mildly bitter mustard sauce  gave the begun kasundi a nice kick and I happily finished off the plastic chutney  so called because of its light, translucent look.The chicken thaala includes mughlai porotas, flaky, fried bread that Calcutta is known for, bhoona khichuri with chicken meatballs, chicken chop, chicken kosha and omelette curry, which is a great Bengali favourite of omelette pieces in a light gravy.The vegetarian thaala has luchi, or maida puris, parwal stuffed with cottage cheese, dhokar dalna, steamed dal cakes in gravy, sukto, a light vegetable mix, mildly bitter and sweet, steamed rice, apart from the four common dishes.The platter didnt come with a sweet. I told Chef Himmat, the man on the spot, hed have a mini Bengali rebellion at hand if there was no dessert. I got a call yesterday to say that mishti doi has now been added to the platter  which I think is a great idea.This may sound corny, but I have just two words for the festival  De taali.Address: Plot No 11, Pocket C 6 & 7, Commercial Complex Vasant Kunj; Tel: 011 41095155; Open from noon to midnight (those under 25 years are only allowed till 6:00 pm)"

5a1465b29855b76bf13e3dc5,How Darjeeling is coping with the strike,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170717/jsp/bengal/story_162329.jsp,2017-07-17,,Telegraph,"A woman checks for Internet signal on her cellphone near the Sikkim border in Darjeeling.Picture by Passang YolmoJuly 16: A month of shutdown has forced lifestyle changes on a hill population short of food, transport and Internet services. A look at how Darjeeling is coping: Long marches Hill residents are walking the extra mile, literally, to keep their hearth burning. A vegetable trader who didn't want to be named said he woke at 4.30am every day and walked 10km to Jorebungalow, and then walked back carrying 30kg to 40kg of vegetables to sell in Darjeeling. ""At night, villagers from various places bring vegetables that are stocked at Jorebungalow,"" he explained. ""Earlier, all we did in the morning (in Darjeeling) was unload the vegetables from the trucks. Now, with no transport, we need to do a lot of legwork. It takes us between one hour and 90 minutes to make it from Jorebungalow with the load."" Today, the trader and his friends carried back cabbage and squash. The shortage has raised vegetable prices by Rs 10 to Rs 20 a kilo. But it's not just the traders - almost every Darjeeling resident is walking a lot more. It's become an unwritten rule that at least one member from each family should attend the Gorkhaland rallies being held every day. ""Attending the rallies is the least we can do for the cause,"" said Sharmila Tamang, a regular. Once the rallies are over around noon, the hunt for vegetables and other rations begins: which means some more walking up and down the hills. Almost every third woman one sees on the town's streets is carrying a shopping bag. ""The bag is always with me these days - who knows when I might chance upon some vegetables?"" a woman said. A resident of Darjeeling's Raj Bari neighbourhood said: ""How long can one watch TV or stay indoors? After the rallies, my friends and I often walk as far as 10km to the town's outskirts, searching for vegetables, mutton and any other edibles."" Rare bird Chicken, most of which used to come from the plains, has virtually vanished off the tables. ""Mutton, pork and beef can be sourced from the countryside but chicken, which used to be the most easily available meat in town, is a struggle to find,"" a resident said. An official at the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park said: ""We need 70kg to 80kg meat every day for the animals. While we are getting mutton and beef, there's no chicken; so we can't rotate the menu like we did."" Among vegetables, the choice is limited to squash and its tendrils, watercress, cabbage and potatoes. ""I have occasionally been able to find beans. My family wasn't too fond of watercress before, but nowadays they don't grumble much,"" a woman said. New nightlife Darjeeling was known to sleep early and silent. Now it's making a beeline for the markets after dark. The night is when food stocks mostly reach the hills, clandestinely - eluding what many allege are the authorities' efforts to stall food lorries at Siliguri to spite the agitation's spearheads. ""The moment the rations come and we open our shop, the stock vanishes,"" a shopkeeper said. Samaritans Hardship has kindled the spirit of humanity. ""With likeminded friends, I have formed a loose group called the Darjeeling Initiative (DI). We are distributing free rations in the villages,"" said Arbin Subba. Pooling their own money with donations from the well-off, Subba and his friends are buying food stocks from the plains, where they have contacts, and distributing packets containing 10kg rice, 500gm lentils and edible oil in hill villages. ""Since July 5, we have reached 224 households covering 14 villages in Okayti, Durpin and Thulung Gaon in Mirik subdivision. Today, we reached out to at least 100 households in Nagri,"" Arbin said. A Darjeeling district court lawyer who lives in Lebong, around 7km from town, said: ""I come to court with my bag full of vegetables and other foodstuff for my friends and acquaintances in Darjeeling every day. Sadly, I have run out of petrol for my two-wheeler from today."" Disconnected The Internet ban imposed since June 20 - officially, to prevent rumour-mongering; allegedly, to prevent mobilisation of agitators - has virtually cut most hills people off from the outside world. ""I can't connect with friends and family members outside the hills. I even have to ration my phone calls; who knows when I might have the next chance to top up my phone credit?"" a college girl said. ""Outstation friends have recharged my credit but you can't ask them to do it again and again."" The Internet ban and lack of transport has left many students struggling to apply for admission to colleges outside the hills. Even local TV channels have been barred from airing. Local news is a trickle now, adding to the day-to-day frustration. Some are attempting to beat the Internet blues. ""Sikkim and Nepal are helping us cheat the Internet ban, but we need to climb up the hills to vantage points to receive signals from Sikkim towns. The data speed is slow and, today, we had no signals from these towers, either,"" said Akash, a college student. On the plus side, social bonding is improving. ""People are now stepping out to socialise. We all gather at one of our neighbours' place in the evening, discuss the agitation and share meals,"" a resident said. ""This is a spirit Darjeeling had lost but is reviving now. Our neighbourhood is turning out to be one big family in this hour of crisis. 'Class' divide The children are probably the happiest lot. With the schools (and colleges) closed since June 15, it's been all play for them, with just a little studying at home. Darjeeling, which hardly offered children any open spaces, has turned into a vast playground, with cricket and football having free run of its streets. The parents are worried, though. ""My son will be taking the ICSE exams next year: I'm concerned how long this strike will last and whether his school will be able to teach the full syllabus,"" a parent said. A group of 11 teachers and some local youths are holding classes for 150-odd students at Takdah. ""Since June 18, we have been teaching them free of charge at the Sirigaon forest community hall and the Tiny Angels School, from 10am to 2pm every day,"" said Trideep Basnet, a teacher. Silver lining A homemaker said the shutdown had opened a window of opportunity for her. ""Every morning, my milkman now delivers not just milk to me but also vegetables, cereals and other foodstuff from his village,"" she said. ""I have begun selling them in front of my home at a small profit. My stock of ginger, garlic, tomatoes and chillies sold out in no time today."""

Picture by Uttam Kumar Pal Naveen gesture NCC cadets take part in a tent pitching competition during a training camp in Rourkela. Picture by Uttam Kumar PalnArch-rivals BJD and BJP welcomed the NDAs presidential candidate Ram Nath Kovind in Bhubaneswar on Friday. However the BJD, despite its support for Kovind, sought to maintain a distance from the BJP and interacted with the NDAs nominee separately at the conference hall in the Assembly. Nevertheless, when it came to the photo session, chief minister Naveen Patnaik held and raised the hand of not only Kovind, but also J.P. Nadda, Union minister and senior BJP leader who had accompanied the former. Though some BJD leaders might have frowned at this, it was widely seen as a gesture of courtesy that drew praise. Predator mess Forest and environment minister Bijayshree Routray is said to be unhappy with his officers, who are yet to catch the animal attacking sheep at Niali and in other areas of the state. Aware of the rising public anger against the authorities on the issue, he is learnt to have given the top mandarins of the department a piece of his mind, but they appear to be helpless. We have stepped up our vigil at Niali and in other areas, where the attacks have taken place. We can catch the predator if it is sighted. When no one has seen it properly, how can we hope to trap it? said a hassled forest officer on duty at Niali. Too costly Tomato prices have gone through the roof leaving consumers in a tight spot. They are fuming at the governments alleged insensitivity with neither agriculture minister nor the food supplies and consumer welfare minister coming to their rescue. While agriculture minister Damodar Rout washed his hands off the price rise blaming it on lack of marketing facilities which, he said, did not fall within his departments purview, food supplies minister Surya Narayan Patro has sought to downplay the issue describing tomato as a non-essential commodity and the price rise a nationwide phenomenon. They dont realise how it has affected the middle class with tomato prices soaring to Rs 80 a kilo from Rs 8 a kilo a month ago, said a homemaker. Open secret Though now it is more than obvious that UPA presidential nominee Meira Kumars visit to Bhubaneswar to meet state Congress MLAs was cancelled because of the continuing tug of war between the Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee (OPCC) and the Congress Legislature Party, some party leaders have sought to make light of it. Party chief whip Tara Prasad Bahinipati, who shares a strained relationship with OPCC president Prasad Harichandan, raised many eyebrows when he described Kumars visit as unnecessary because party MLAs were going to vote for her anyway. Its true that party legislators will vote for her but we all know what scuttled her visit, said a senior Congress leader. Lonely leader Former minister Bimbadhar Kuanr, who had ended his old ties with the BJP to join the BJD three years ago, seems to be ploughing a lonely furrow in his adopted party. If sources close to the leader are to be believed, the veteran from west Odisha, who had held many important positions during his time with the BJP, is hardly ever seen in programmes organised by the ruling party.However, since he had quit the saffron outfit accusing its leadership of ignoring him, he will find it hard to make a comeback. Besides there has to be some excuse for going back. At the moment he cant think of anything, said a sympathiser of the beleaguered leader. FOOTNOTE Damodar Rout Back in the game Criticism of his rather loose tongue notwithstanding, agriculture minister Damodar Rout continues to enjoy the confidence of chief minister Naveen Patnaik. In fact, he seems to be having a great run of luck. During Naveens last ministry rejig, he benefited the most by bagging the plum agriculture portfolio coveted by many colleagues. His importance within the ministry has also gone up with him being allotted the seat next to Naveen in the Assembly. Critics had written him off. But he has proved all of them wrong, said a BJD leader. Ashutosh Mishra"
5a1466b39855b76bf13e3e96,A tale of the flying tomato,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170717/jsp/jharkhand/story_162279.jsp,2017-07-17,,Telegraph,"The story of the tomato is one of rags-to-riches in Ranchi. Farmers had been forced to destroy tonnes of this edible fruit - rich in the healthy antioxidant pigment lycopene - in January this year when the supply-demand mismatch dragged down prices to as low as Rs 2 a kilo. By mid-July, the tomato is back with a bang - a rare relish with a premium tag of Rs 100 a kg. President of Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FJCCI) Vinay Kumar Agrawal blamed the monsoon for the abnormal rise in tomato price. ""Increase in rates is not unusual in the rainy season because local farmers depend on import from Bangalore and Nasik. And this year, the supply is also poor; hence, the price is hitting the roof. There will be no relief till the end of monsoon (September),"" he said. It goes without saying that homemakers in the state capital are grappling with their kitchen budget. Pinky Sharma of Upper Bazaar quipped that a curry with tomatoes had become a status symbol. ""I was buying half a kilo for Rs 50 from a vendor and people were looking at me as if I were some maharani (queen). It gave me such complex that I settled for 250gm,"" she chortled. Saraswati Devi, who works at a computer accessories store, said she had switched to bottled ketchup. ""I noticed the price skyrocketing last (Saturday) evening and decided to shift allegiance. While a kilo of raw tomatoes was being sold at Rs 80-100 per kg, a 1kg bottle of ketchup is available at Rs 100-130. The latter is cost-effective because it lasts longer,"" she added. Madhvi Mishra, a resident of Vidyapati Nagar, recalled how an acquaintance had to deal with his 12-year-old daughter's tantrums because he did not buy tomatoes for her birthday party. ""The little girl loves the tangy taste of homemade sauce and couldn't come to terms with the fact that there were no tomatoes on her birthday menu,"" Mishra said. On January 30 this year, farmers of Bundu, protesting against the dearth of cold storage facilities and food processing plants, had destroyed tonnes of tomatoes. Similar protests had taken place at many other places on the outskirts of the capital. Farmer Keshwar Sahu on Sunday said a proper storage and supply plan could alone put a check on abnormal pricing of perishable items. ""Otherwise, the story will be same every year. Tomatoes will sometimes be down to earth, literally, as it happened a few months ago; and sometimes they will be too pricey for consumption like now,"" he summed up.

Picture by Ashwinee PatiTomato prices have soared in the past month, from Rs 25 per kilogram to Rs 100-Rs 110 per kilogram in Bhubaneswar. Lelin Mallick of The Telegraph speaks to traders, residents, and experts to find out the rationale behind the price rise The problem Tomato was being sold at Rs 25 a kilogram in various city markets just a month ago. The state's tomato farmers resorted to agitation in March and dumped quintals of the fruit on the roads to protest against distress sale. The price of the crop had even dipped to Re 1 per kilogram in Keonjhar, Angul and Bargarh during the summer, spurring the Opposition Congress and the BJP to demonstrate against the government. Reason behind the price rise The city is dependant on Karnataka for supply tomato with 20 trucks arriving daily. It has come down to three to four trucks over the past few days. Traders said the city's daily requirement was 100 tonnes of tomato, the supply of which has come down by almost 80 per cent. Traders fear that the price would touch Rs 100 in a couple of days. The city is reliant on Bengal, Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh for the crop. Low yield in Bengal led to a stop in tomato imports to the city. Besides, fresh crop from Karnataka reaches the city in a week. Traders said the state capital never depended on locally grown tomato during monsoon. Price difference The wholesale price of the fruit is Rs 60 per kilogram but when it reaches the retailers, the price rises by Rs 20 (around 30 per cent). Traders attributed the difference to the crop's perishable nature. They also said the crop couldn't be stored for long. Improvement likely Traders said the situation was likely to improve in a week or two. ""We have to wait for fresh produce, either from Karnataka or Himachal Pradesh, which may take another one to two weeks,"" said secretary of the Raw Vegetable Merchants' Association, Kabiraj Swain. State's role The state government attributed sale of tomato at throwaway prices in various districts to over production of the crop. But it had failed to set up adequate cold storages to store tomato, which has been witnessing frequent price rise along with onion. Public opinion ""The crop used to be sold at cheaper rates in the summer, but the state government failed to arrange proper facility to store the crop. If the government had managed to store the crop properly, the price might not have skyrocketed during the rains. Tomato has become a luxury even for the middle class,"" said Deepak Panigrahi, a sales executive and resident of Bhubaneswar."

The price of tomato is shooting up faster than the Sensex. The buzz in the markets is that a dip in production across the country has led to a shortfall in supply, coinciding with the season when local produce is not available. The price of tomato has increased by almost Rs 40 a kilo in the Maniktala market since Metro first highlighted the upswing on July 11. The produce currently available in Calcutta markets is mostly from Karnataka. Tomato becomes dearer between late June and early or mid-August, when the city becomes dependent on supplies from Karnataka. The markets are flooded with produce from within Bengal for around five months before that. Several retailers said the price rise this year was abnormal. College teacher Debayan Basu, who lives in Maniktala, bought tomato for Rs 120 a kilo last week. ""I do not remember when I last paid so much for this vegetable,"" he said. Compared to Maniktala, the price of a kilo of tomato is at present lower in New Market (Rs 80) and Lake Market (Rs 90). Abhijit Kumar Nandi, head of the department of agricultural economics at Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswa Vidyalaya, linked the abnormal price rise to less than normal production in the last crop year (July to June). ""During the 2015-16 crop year, tomato production in India was very good, because of which farmers did not get the price they expected,"" he said. After taking a price hit in the 2015-16 crop year, wary farmers apparently scaled down production in the subsequent year, which meant less supply to markets like Bengal. ""The total area under tomato cultivation was smaller in 2016-17 because farmers did not want a rerun of 2015-16. They preferred growing other crops instead. They feared that they may again incur losses if supply of tomatoes is higher than demand,"" Nandi said. The second factor in the price rise is that produce from Bengal has long disappeared from the markets. Tomato is grown in the state in winter. During that period, the price of the vegetable plummets because of abundant supply. Besides farmers reducing the area of cultivation, climatic conditions have had a role to play in the quantity of production this year. Tomato being essentially a cold crop, the shortening of winter is having an effect on productivity."

Retail inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), jumped to 2.36 per cent in July on a yearly basis after easing for three straight months. The rise in the CPI was driven by hardening of prices in sugar and confectionery items, pan, tobacco and intoxicants. However, there was disinflation in the food basket. The RBI, which factors in CPI for arriving at its monetary policy, had earlier this month slashed the key interest rate (repo rate) by 25 basis point to 6 per cent. However, the industry expects a bigger rate reduction. Another macro-economic indicator for July showed that the wholesale price index (WPI) inflation rose sharply to 1.88 per cent - the first rise in five months - as some food articles turned dearer even as the industry pitched for a cut in interest rates citing weak industrial activity. With the prices of tomatoes jumping up sharply in July, WPI inflation in vegetables shot up 21.95 per cent. According to CPI data released by the Central Statistics Office, food inflation saw deflationary pressure at (-)0.29 per cent in July against (-)2.12 per cent in June this year. While vegetable prices in July were 3.5 per cent lower than the same month last year, they have been rising on a sequential basis. The RBI had noted this in its bi-monthly policy review. ""There are now visible signs, however, of the usual seasonal price spikes, even if with a delay and especially in respect of tomatoes, onions and milk,"" the RBI said. However, India Inc believes that there is room for further rate cut by the RBI to boost investments from the private sector and revive industrial growth. Industrial output had hit a four-year low and contracted 0.1 per cent in June, mainly on account of a decline in manufacturing and capital goods sectors. ""Given the trend and outlook for inflation, we see clear space for a more accommodative stance in the monetary policy. This is all the more important, given the state of industrial sector where growth is anaemic,"" said industry chamber Ficci. The mid-year economic survey tabled in Parliament last weak had said that with inflation ruling low, there was scope for reducing the RBI's key policy rate by 25-75 basis points. On the inflation data, economic affairs secretary Subhash Chandra Garg in a tweet said: ""Both WPI and CPI inch up in July at 1.88 per cent and 2.4 per cent year on year. But still below the comfort level of 4 per cent."""

(Hardeep Singh) A week after the state food and civil supplies department directed traders to fix the retail price of tomato between Rs 75 and Rs 80 per kg, residents in Ranchi are continuing to pay anything between Rs 100 and Rs 120 a kilo. Homemakers rue that the rates are fluctuating from not just market to market, but from vendor to vendor. While Saraswati Singh of Piska More was lucky to purchase tomatoes for Rs 60 per kg at Naga Baba vegetable market on Tuesday, Babita Sharma of Upper Bazaar had had to pay an additional Rs 20 at the same market a day before. ""It is so confusing and unfair. Retailers are fleecing customers because there is no one to govern prices,"" said Babita. Surabhi Sinha, another resident of Piska More, and Nisha Singh of Booty More sounded equally annoyed. ""Last (Monday) night, I bought a kilo of tomato for Rs 120. When I told the shopkeeper about the government directive on retail price, he asked me to find another vendor if I wanted a better rate,"" said Surabhi. Nisha said few people had the time and energy to hop markets for a reasonable price. ""We are suffering because the government hasn't implemented its order."" The vegetable market at Sector-II in Dhurwa seemed to be the most reasonable one. Rajni, a local resident, said she struck gold at Rs 60 per kg. Sudama Sahu, a farmer who sells vegetables on Kanke Road, admitted that the price of tomato hadn't stabilised. ""Vendors in posh areas like Ashoknagar and Morabadi are charging more,"" he said. Jharkhand imports its tomato stocks from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Madan Prasad, a wholesaler at Pandra Bazar Samiti, said the wholesale price was between Rs 45 and Rs 50. ""Retail price shouldn't be more than Rs 70 in that case, but vendors are fleecing people,"" he added. Minister Saryu Roy, who had ordered the tomato price cap on July 24, said he was unaware of any variation. ""If any individual vendor is ignoring the government directive, he or she will face the music,"" Roy promised."

Picture by Ashwinee Pati Bhubaneswar, Aug. 2: The state government today resorted to market intervention by fixing the price limit for onion, which is now selling at Rs 25 a kg in retail market. Food supplies and consumer welfare minister Surya Narayan Patro today asked the traders to sell onion within Rs 17 per kg and warned stern action in case of hoarding the commodity. Patro said the department had been instructed to keep close watch over the price situation. Officials will purchase onion from the source and sell it at fair price shops of the government named as ""Maitree"" at reasonable price. In the first phase, it will be sold in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack. The department has been asked to keep a token of Re 1 profit margin per kg and sell it to make the retail price affordable for the consumers. However, consumers have been left high and dry as onion price is now selling in the city at Rs 25 per kg. The price of onion was Rs 15 per kg early last week. The rise in onion price following the soaring of tomato price has hit the consumers hard. Last week, tomato was selling at Rs 100 per kg in retail market. The state needs nearly five lakh tonnes of onion annually of which it produces nearly three to 3.5 lakh tonnes. Odisha produces onions mainly in Kalahandi, Balangir, Boudh and Angul districts as well as a few areas in the state's western districts. Odisha depends mainly on Maharshtra, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh for procurement of onions. Wholesalers said the recent floods in Nashik and crop loss in Andhra Pradesh had led to the price rise. ""The price of onion has increased at source points. The city is getting the normal supply of 10 to 15 trucks of onion on daily basis, but as the price has increased in the procurement areas, it has its impact in the state as well,"" said Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha secretary Sudhakar Panda. Traders apprehend that the current price would prevail till November. ""The winter crop from Nashik will reach the state in November. Besides, onions grown in various parts of the state will also enter the market in the winter and then the price will stabilise,"" said Panda. Farmers and traders said the state was suffering because of lack of adequate number of cold storages. The state had witnessed distress sale of onions in March. However, the state government had attributed distress sale to the over-production of the crop. ""However, the state government is yet to come up with adequate cold storages to ease the problem,"" said Abhiram Jena, a farmer. On the other hand, consumers are still bearing the brunt of price rise. ""The consumers have been badly hit by the skyrocketing prices of vegetables during rains. In this circumstances, price rise of onions will definitely put burden on us,"" said Nirakar Pradhan, a consumer."

Picture by Swapnaneel Bhattacharjee Silchar, Aug. 19: Karimganj deputy commissioner Pradip Kumar Talukdar today said teams would be sent to markets across the district to inspect whether uniformity is being maintained in prices of vegetables. The prices have shot up immensely following the recent waves of floods. A large number of citizens have alleged that some vendorsraders, taking advantage of the floods, are charging arbitrarily. Talukdar, who held a meeting with administration officials this afternoon on the issue, said a report would be submitted on the basis of the inspection and stern action would be taken against those found to have fleeced the public by overcharging them. Currently, the prices of some of the vegetables are - chilly (Rs 300/kg), brinjal (Rs 80/kg), string beans (Rs 80/kg), tomato (Rs 70/kg), ridge gourd (Rs 60/kg), cabbage, radish, eddoe (all Rs 50/kg), onion and sayote (Rs 40/kg) and potato (Rs 20/kg). These rates are prevalent in most markets, including Chantar Bazar, Nilambazar, Shanibari Bazar and Kaliganj. In some places, the prices fluctuate and are even higher, residents alleged. The general secretary of Chantar Bazar Byabsayi Samiti, Pijush Das, said crops have been damaged across the state because of floods this year, pushing up the prices of vegetables, and it would take some time for circumstances to return to normal. He added that vegetables are being sold at rates equal to other markets in Chantar Bazar market and that vendors here do not fleece customers. Narrating the plight of lower middle class and poor people because of unethical practices adopted by a section of vendors, Abdul Bakkar, a retired grade IV government employee, said people are already facing extreme financial troubles because of the floods and the skyrocketing prices of vegetables/commodities added insult to injury. crisis of having vegetables in the district In summer, farmers of Karimganj district grow vegetables like okra, ridge gourd, bottle gourd, pointed gourd, bitter gourd, cucumber and others. In winter, vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower, turnip, carrot, capsicum and others are grown, he mentioned. Nearly 2,300 hectares of cultivable land, where vegetables are grown, have been damaged and more than 30,000 farmers have suffered losses because of floods this year. Sources said vegetables are being brought to Karimganj from Tripura, Shillong and Barpeta district, among others. However, since floods have affected those places too, the problem has been aggravated."

The star hotel has partnered with Gujarat Tourism for the food promotion.We began with Hondvo, Methi Na Muthiya and Petis Corn Tikka. We liked the muthiya as the besan batter was nicely mixed with spices like Shepherds Purse, black salt and dry fenugreek leaves. Petis Corn Tikka was crispy and at the same time filling because of potatoes. To go with the starters, were an array of pickles such as green chilies pickle, mango pickle both in sweet and sour variety. In the main course, what we liked was Sev Tamatar: a preparation of tomato curry to which crispy crunchy sev was added. It tasted really well with Bajre Ki Roti and Thepla. We also tried Gujarati Kadhi with Bardoli Ki Khichdi. Gujarati Daal was a bit sweet like other dishes. Executive chef Nitin Mathur from Ahmedabad along with few other chefs curated the menu.For the desserts we recommend Moong Daal Ka Sheera and Mohanthhal: a halwa of yellow lentils with fried nuts.

However, even after an increase in the production and supply, the prices are on the rise this year. During Dasara last year we received close to 400 quintals of the vegetable and the price was also stable, the official said.

Declaring Nargund of Gadag district the first open defecationfree (ODF) taluk in Karnataka on Tuesday, Naidu said over 2.45 lakh villages, 1,300 cities, 200 districts and five states have been declared ODF so far. All the villages along the banks of the Ganga have been declared ODF.He pointed out that over 5 crore toilets have been constructed in rural and urban areas in the last couple of years. There is still some distance to cover and the nation is committed to achieving open defecation-free status by October 2019, he added. Appreciating the performance of Karnataka on this front, the Vice-President said the household sanitation coverage in the state was only 30 per cent in 2014. Since then, the state has showed a remarkable progress in achieving over 72 per cent coverage today.The programme called Shouchalayakkaagi Samara (Crusade for Toilets) is being implemented across Karnataka as a peoples movement to stop open defecation.

5a1483029855b76bf13e50f3,Just right for the day,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170926/jsp/opinion/story_174961.jsp,2017-09-26,,Telegraph,"The first thing you eat and drink in the morning is hugely important. The beverage and food provides fuel to a body that has, usually, not ingested anything for a good few hours. The quality and quantity, the taste and the 'rightness' of the first meal also go a long way towards shaping the start of your day and possibly the whole day itself. Furthermore, that first intake also fits in with a whole cluster of morning rituals that define who you are, ethnically, culturally, socially and class-wise. Or, horror of horrors, it doesn't actually gel with your usual habits and needs, creating its own misregistration between you and the day. Or, then again, the change of morning alimentation could provide a delicious challenge to an intrepid, unprejudiced and curious traveller. In my family of three, breakfast didn't actually exist. My parents would drink tea in the morning ( desi style, CTC, milk and sugar), while listening to the radio and reading the newspaper. Watching them, I used to think the crackling pages were actually their morning nashta, though they would also snack on some non-oily, non-spicy chevdo and some biscuits. The real meal would only come in the shape of an early lunch around 11 am. They could afford to stick to this very Gujju routine because my father ran his own business and my mother taught in a college where she never had early classes. On the other hand, I had to be given fodder before school and so strategies were developed, involving fruits, Bournvita, Ovaltine, Cadbury's Hot Chocolate and toast. My Madrasi friend who lived down the road came to school having quaffed lovely home-made idli, vada and dosai, which I thought was hugely unfair. At some point, eggs and I were introduced to each other by my mother, but outside our strictly vegetarian home. By and by, I discovered the illicit, taboo-joy of meat, which meant bacon or sausages along with the eggs. There was an epiphanic moment at age 15, on the first day of my first trip to the West. Travelling with my father on a strict budget, we found ourselves in a small hotel in Paris, confronting the all-important free breakfast that came with the price of the room. I sipped on magical hot chocolate, the likes of which I'd never tasted before, and simultaneously discovered this flaky, buttery, airy thing called a croissant and the French jams that go with it. At that age I knew a tiny bit about French painting and sculpture but this breakfast was the first time I encountered Gallic culture viscerally, haptically, through touch, smell and taste, and I was left flabbergasted - no wonder they painted so brilliantly after such a breakfast. Later, I came across the comment of the great film-maker, Jean Renoir: ""the quality of the day's shooting depends on the taste of the first cup of coffee in the morning."" By this time I'd graduated through my first encounter with the French petit djeuner and had had close dealings with all sorts of different breakfasts. There was the ghastly 'dead omelette' and banana at boarding school, variations on the same theme on the Indian railways, and, in contrast, the winter joys of stuffed paranthas, achar and dahi in roadside dhabas in north India. Filming in rural Bengal, you realized that 'breakfast' was as alien a concept here as in a middle-class Gujju household, often consisting of lal chaa accompanied by chirey or dry muri with green chillies and mustard oil. Travelling in Rajasthan, the tea came with dry rotis and pickles. South India was a heaven of different kinds of home-made dosai, upmas and utthapams. In Maharashtra, the sweet Gujju tea was tweaked just that little bit with spices that made it undrinkable for someone like me, but the pohey were a revelation. In various parts of the country, people with a little bit of money were also able to bombard their stomachs, first thing in the morning, with deep fried samosas, filluries and bhajiyas. Upon travelling, all sorts of categorizations would attack the mind that was just waking up. Breakfasts were cold or hot, heavy or light, centred around sweet tastes or savoury, expansively vegetarian, with a small non-veg presence or a truckload of meat with some tiny vegetable alibis on the side; there were summer breakfasts in hot countries and then summer ones in cold countries; winter breakfasts in the tropics and winter breakfasts with icicles hanging from the window. The one hugely unhealthy thing that became a constant for far too many of us was the coupling of a cup of tea or coffee with a cigarette; this would be first thing we would touch in the morning before space was created, biologically and mentally, for any solid food. At some point in a wintry Paris very different from the one I first visited, working on finishing the post-production of a film, I was introduced to the 'French working man's breakfast', which added a shot or two of cognac to the already formidable coffee and cigarette combination. In contrast to the gut-scouring sparseness of this lunacy were the examples of extreme morning excess. At a certain young age in America, it seemed to me and my pals a fun idea to put away a stack of pancakes, two kinds of egg, sausages, bacon and hash browns plus coffee and juice, all in one eating frenzy in some diner. Across the Atlantic, the 'Full English' was no less bruising: eggs, mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, all the aforementioned pig variations plus black pudding (for those who don't know: a delicious, dark biscuit of dried beef blood). As a change from this, one thankfully came across one standard Middle Eastern breakfast which consisted of olives, hummus, various other pastes, roasted and raw vegetables, salad and pita bread. Speaking of a 'Full English', I recently found myself watching a documentary titled Secrets of the Royal Kitchen, where one got to see two kinds of breakfast being made in the British royal kitchens. One was a 'normal' breakfast for Her Maj, elaborately eviscerated discs of brioche were lightly fried to make cages for poached eggs, which were then served with sausages. The other was a reconstruction of the wedding brekker made for the union of Charles and Diana in 1981, a meal eaten by the royals and a hundred and twenty of their closest friends. Starring on the menu were quenelles of brill with a lobster sauce and a breast of chicken stuffed with a lamb mousse, coated with brioche breadcrumbs, a minted cream sauce and samphire. Somewhere else in the film it says Queen Elizabeth never travels without crates and crates of her own English bottled water. No matter where in the world, the royal tea is always made with this same water. Watching this food porn I felt no twitch of lust for all the expensive, elaborate food that was being made and displayed. One of the things that put me off was when they said no garlic at all was allowed into the royal kitchens. As one grows older the realization hits the gut: eating some things in the morning makes you happy while eating other things, no matter how delicious, can destroy your day; if you eat healthily most of the time you can indulge occasionally; a croissant is a confection of genius but it is essentially a very small, fluffy lachha parantha that's been rolled up; muesli, fruits and raw nuts are not just a fad; garlic is one of the healthiest things you can eat raw in the morning. Another realization also lands, perhaps only partly true, but I'll venture it anyway: you can mess with a person's eating habits for lunch and dinner far more easily than you can with their breakfast. Just as the first language you learn, your mother tongue, is said to be stored in a different part of the brain from all the subsequent languages you pick up, I suspect the construction and taste of one's basic breakfast is also stored in a special place. This is perhaps why I find myself craving a sada dosa or a plate of luchi-alu while looking at artisanal brioche being carved into twee little medallions."

Here's how you can opt for healthy ready-to-eat...,http://www.hindustantimes.com/fitness/canned-food-got-you-in-a-pickle-here-s-how-you-can-opt-for-healthy-ready-to-eat-meals/story-69mV8NyIUMsBFC4D0osBzK.html,2017-10-01,,Hindustan Times,"Theres nothing more satiating than relishing a traditional home cooked meal after a tiring day at work. But, thanks to our lifestyle, cooking after work feels like a tiresome chore. And, this is the reason why we are increasingly opting for ready-to-eat processed Indian meals, packaged chutneys and pickles. The appeal of these processed products is simple. You dont have to cook; they go straight from spoon to mouth. However, we conveniently ignore the fact that these processed foods come laden with preservatives that are extremely unhealthy and ecologically unsustainable. To combat the rise of packaged unsustainable Indian foods, many food enthusiasts are popularising homemade Indian sustainable products, which include pickles, condiments and ready-made meals. I love cooking traditional South Indian meals. Every time I used an age old recipe, I struggled with getting authentic masalas. The ready-made condiments available in the market lack authentic flavour and aroma. Thats when I decided to make my own masalas. I make gunpowder, sambar powder and tamarind rice mix at home. They became so popular among my friends that they prodded me to launch my own range of masalas. We use traditional recipes to make preservative free, fresh, natural, and healthy products, says 50-year-old Sudha Raj. She started her venture last year in August, under the name of Zing, along with her 58-year- old sister, Sushila Srinivasan. Sudha says its a myth that homemade masalas and condiments have a very short shelf life. The shelf life of these products can go up to one year, depending on the product. Her products start at Rs150.Preserving our rich culinary traditionApart from being healthy, sustainable food products help preserve our rich culinary tradition. Our recipes have been handed over through generations. I dont think you can enjoy authentic Indian food if you club processed product to your food. What we make at home is free of chemicals and added colours. Our raw papaya, tomato and garlic relish and pickles such as adrak ka achar and hari mirch ka achar are very popular . The starting price of one jar is Rs100,says 34-year- old chef Chandrashekar, who has been making homemade preservative-free pickles for 4 years now.Economic ChallengesMango chilli jam available at Rummy Kitchen .Despite various benefits that come with sustainable products, economic challenges are a barrier to making it a preferred choice for consumers as compared to packaged products. Organic, fresh ingredients are expensive to acquire. Competing with big brands that produce in bulk and sell at low cost, is difficult. Consumers also prefer buying off-the-shelf products. And convenience and pricing become the determining factor, says 45-year-old Inderpreet Nagpal, who started her food venture Rummy Kitchen, three years ago.Inderpreet makes organic pickles and jams. Her range includes chicken, surmai, pork, prawns, keema pickles and jams such as mutton chilli jam and bacon jam. The starting price for one jar is Rs200.Apart from the expensive ingredients, getting a license to market homemade products to grocery stores is also a challenge. You need to register and get a license to market your product. To get a license to sell, you need to show a turnover of at least Rs12 lakh minimum. This is why our products dont make it to grocery stores, says Sudha Raj.Aloo Goli available at Just 2 Eat.So, how does one deal with the economic challenge? 42-year-old Manmohan Singh, who started his venture Just 2 Eat, six months ago, believes that one can deal with economic hindrances by mass producing sustainable food items. We produce packaged Indian food without using preservatives. Through our NGO Singh Educational Welfare Association along with the help of KVIC (Khadi And Village Industries Commission), we impart culinary skills to children above the age of 16 years in rural places. The advantage of this is that we are able to produce mass quantities of sustainable Indian food. These kids acquire the necessary skills to start their own small venture in the near future. Also, it stops rural migration of the children to metropolitan cities, says Singh. His products start at Rs90 and include ready-to-eat dishes such as Aloo Gobhi, Rajma Chawal, and Chicken Biryani.Expert opinion on preservativesPreservatives contains chemicals such as formalin and sodium metaborate. They are high in sodium content. In the long run, they can harm our internal organs such as heart, liver and the kidneys. They also cause high blood pressure and obesity. Packaged products that have a very long shell life are risky, as they contain too many preservatives. Preservatives can make us feel lethargic and irritated. - Dr Mohsin Wali, cardiologist and former honorary physician to the President"

Picture by Ngangbam Indrakanta Singh Imphal, Sept. 21: The 24-hour strike imposed across the state by Co-ordination Committee (CorCom), a conglomeration of several outfits of Manipur and Manipur Naga Revolutionary Front (MNRF), today hit normal life. The strike was called to protest the merger of Manipur with the Indian Union in 1949 on this day. The outfits alleged that Maharaj Bodhachandra Singh, the then king of Manipur, was forced to sign the merger agreement with the government of India and the state formally became a part of India on October 15 the same year. The Coalition for Indigenous Rights Campaign (Circa) also recalled the Manipur merger agreement and organised the National Repentance Day at Sana Konung (royal temple), here. Shops, business establishments and educational institutions were shut as a result of the strike. The roads wore a deserted look. Work in the government offices almost came to a standstill. However, a few women vendors at Khwairambandh Bazar continued their business as usual on the roadside. Basic services like medical and fire services were exempt from the purview of the strike. A woman vegetable vendor at the market here said, ""Whenever there is a bandh, we suffer a lot. All my rice, beans and tomatoes could not be sold today and tomorrow nobody will buy them as they will be almost rotten. Any form of protest should not affect poor people like us."" On the occasion of the repentance day function, Angom Ningthou, an executive member of Utra Sanglen, said Manipur had various issues which remain unresolved. ""We realised that the issues can be solved only when Manipur regains pre-merger status. We recall that this day Maharaj Bodhachandra was forced to sign the merger agreement. We take it as the most unfortunate day among those historic events from 1947 to 1949,"" he said. Paosing Golmei, a co-convener of Circa, said, ""Although the people of the state are aware that Manipur was a sovereign state, they seem to have completely forgotten that it was forcibly merged with India. Most people do not take it seriously. The original culture and traditions of the state became weak due to the intervention of external forces."" Manipur's ""national flag"", which bore the emblem of lord Pakhangba of the Meiteis, was flown half-mast at the event. Two-minutes' silence was also observed. The repentance day event was attended by various civil organisations and members of students' groups."

The driver was wounded and the truck stopped, the ministry said in a statement.A Western security source told AFP that each 20-litre drum contained ammonium nitrate, which is also used to make fertilizer. The containers were connected by yellow electric cables, photographs showed.The only thing missing was the device to detonate the explosives, he said.Security in the Afghan capital has been ramped up since May 31 when a massive truck bomb ripped through the citys diplomatic quarter, killing about 150 and wounding around 400 people, mostly civilians.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack -- the deadliest in the city since 2001 -- that Western officials say was caused by more than 1,500 kg of explosives packed in a sewage truck.The government has blamed the Taliban-allied Haqqani Network for the bombing. Taliban militants rarely claim responsibility for attacks that kill large numbers of civilians.Following outrage over the attack authorities increased the number of police checkpoints in the diplomatic zone and installed special barriers to prevent trucks from entering the centre of the city.Scanners to check lorries wanting access to the area where embassies and international organisations are located were also being used.In August Afghan intelligence seized a truck in Kabul carrying more than 16 tonnes of explosives hidden in boxes marked as poultry feed.But despite the enhanced security measures insurgents have continued to carry out carnage in the capital.In the most recent major attack a suicide bomber disguised as a shepherd blew himself up near a Shiite mosque in Kabul last month killing six people.Ordinary Afghans have borne the brunt of the 16-year insurgency, with more than 26,500 civilians killed and nearly 49,000 wounded as a result of armed conflict since January 2009, according to UN figures.Suicide and militant attacks have been particularly deadly. Between January and September 1,584 civilians were killed and wounded in such incidents, the UN says, accounting for 20 percent of casualties over the nine-month period."

He was the first to find the location and altitude of Lhasa .He mapped the course of Tsangpo river and the trade route between Nepal and Tibet.The Doodle, designed by Hari and Deepti Panicker, portrays Rawat as he might have looked on his travels  solitary and courageous, looking back over the distances he had walked, rosary beads in hand, and staff by his side, reads Googles description of the explorer.Rawat, who was recruited by the British for mapping, used to disguise as a Tibetan monk and walk as far as Kathmandu in Nepam, Lhasa in Tibet and Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh. He concealed instruments like a compass in his prayer wheel and hid his travel records as prayers. His pace during his travels remained uniform and he measures his steps using a rosary.Rawat was also recruited by German geographers, the Schlagintweit brothers, in 1855, according to an NDTV report.He was awarded the Patrons Medal in 1877 by the Royal Geographical Society for his explorations. British Colonel Henry Yule advocated for awarding Rawat and spoke about him during the medal presentation ceremony. He said the explorer is not a topographical automaton, or merely one of a great multitude of native employees with an average qualification. His observations have added a larger amount of important knowledge to the map of Asia then those of any other living man, a Frontline article said.A book on Rawat titled Asia Ki Peeth Par (On the Back of Asia) was published in 2006, illuminating the writings and life of the 19th century Indian explorer.Rawat died of a heart attack while visiting Jagir, a village gifted to him by the British, in 1895.Google marks significant events and honours the achievements of people from different walks of life. On Thursday, the Doodle marked the 107th birth anniversary of Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, the first astrophysicist to have won a Nobel Prize for his theory on the evolution of stars."

The National Institute of Plant Health Management (NIPHM), a body under the Union agriculture ministry, is conducting the three-year study in collaboration with Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana. The study began in October last year.Use of proper techniques, giving the correct amount of dose at an appropriate time and increased awareness among farming community has led to the positive results.The first-year results of the study are encouraging. Things are not as bad as we think. We couldnt find as much pesticide residue as has been publicised. In none of the tomato samples, did we detect pesticides above the prescribed MRL (Maximum Residue Limit), said Dr G Jayalakshmi, director NIPHM, adding that pesticide residues couldnt be detected from samples taken from organic and Integrated Pest Management (IPM) fields. IPM is a method by which soil is worked on to make it better prepared for pest management.Some fruit samples drawn from conventional farmers fields showed the presence of residues of mancozeb, profenophos and triazophos, but these were also below the MRL levels and thus safe, she added.The methodology of the studyTwo crops were studied in both kharif and rabi seasons. To distinguish between fields, samples were also taken from organic and conventional fields. Specifically, samples were collected from one-acre fields in Swal village in Sultanpur Lodhi, Kapurthala. The organic field selected was from Dvyagram village, Nurmahal, in Jalandhar. For conventional fields, 10 villages in Kapurthala were chosen to take samples.Pesticide consumption has dropped: PAU studyAs if to support this theory, a PAU study found that the consumption of insecticides in Punjab has declined from 3,800 metric tonnes in 2001-02 to 2,344 metric tonnes in 2016-17, a drop of around 40%. Another PAU study on status of pesticide residues in Punjab done on 5,224 food crops from 2011 to 2017 also shows that almost 92% of crops were free of pesticides. This signals a significant trend reversal as a similar study on 1,507 crops done three decades ago from 1981 to 1990 showed only 22% within the safe limit. PAU vice-chancellor Dr Baldev Singh Dhillon said, Tomatoes are also consumed raw in large quantities and the studys results are welcome.Punjab farmer now far more educated: PAU VCAdvances in research have contributed to ensuring food safety and ensured that pesticide residues in crops is contained within limits, PAU V-C Baldev Singh Dhillon said. He added that the Punjabi farmer is now far more educated. Use of proper techniques, giving the correct amount of dose at an appropriate time and increased awareness among farming community has led to the positive results, he added."

Youre going to get some inside information now, so listen close. Did you know that even with a very superficial understanding of how press previews work, you could make a fairly accurate prediction about how a movie will ultimately be received?You did? Then feel free to skip ahead. The rest of you, gather round.Allow me to illustrate with three examples, all from 2017: Edgar Wrights Baby Driver, the upcoming Thor: Ragnarok, and the reason behind this blatant procrastination, Geostorm.A large part of Baby Drivers marketing highlighted its (then) phenomenal 100% Rotten Tomatoes score. Sony premiered the film at the South by Southwest Festival, more than three months before its worldwide release. During the weeks leading up to its release, they encouraged everyone whod seen it to talk about it online, and no embargoes were enforced on critics reviews. So when the time finally came for the world to watch what Wright had made, the buzz was firmly in place.Its been a similar story for Thor  and, you will notice, most Marvel films  which held its first press screenings two whole weeks before release day. Its currently the highest-rated MCU movie ever, with a 99% score on Rotten Tomatoes. That number will go down for sure, but the fact that it has become a talking point illustrates what Im getting at.Geostorm, meanwhile  lets just get this over with  was not screened for the press in advance. The first batch of professional reviews appeared online a day after its release. If you take a look at its RT page, youd see only a handful of them - a suspiciously small number - all presumably written by journalists whod paid to see it.The point being, despite what they tell you in trailers and advertisements, studios usually know exactly what they have on their hands. And in the case of Geostorm, the latest in our scheduled biannual abusive appointment with Gerard Butler, Warner Bros saw a cut back in 2015, decided it wasnt up to the mark, had the director unceremoniously booted off the project, spent millions on reshoots, and still delivered one of the worst movies of the year.Its a personal rule to avoid reading/watching opinions about a film before having seen it myself, but its so difficult to resist a signature Mark Kermode rant. I think its the stupidest film I have ever seen, said the Observer critic, slouched on his chair with an appearance of a man forced to reconsider everything hes believed in.And thats the overall emotion Geostorm leaves you with  oddly introspective. Not only does it make you question your life  why do you love movies at all, why did you waste precious moments of your youth yelling This is Sparta at your friends, whatll it take to get Gerard Butler to stop  but it also makes you question things you genuinely adore.For example, nothing in this movie is as far fetched as your average Tintin comic  but only one of them is a timeless masterpiece. And just the fact that you had this thought at all is a testament to the soul-sucking evilness of this movie.Watching it  or more accurately, enduring it, and surviving it  will make you want to undergo an exorcism, or a lobotomy. Itll leave you wondering if being frozen alive, or being pelted in the face with football-sized hail, or being crushed under an airliner dropping out of the sky  all honest-to-god things that happen in this movie  would be such a bad idea after all.Without wasting much time  because, lets be honest, most people have gone already; they saw that rating  heres taking a stab at the insane plot: After a series of calamitous events caused by climate change, a group of international scientists lead by Jake Lawson (Butler), builds a system of satellites called Dutch Boy designed to control weather disruptions. Soon, however, Dutch Boy is hacked into, hijacked, and weaponised. Temperatures plunge in Rio, the heavens burst open in Hong Kong, and the oceans rise in New Orleans  and this is just the beginning, Jake prophecies. Its all leading up to an apocalyptic event, a Geostorm. Cue the dramatic music and cheesy sound effects.Its all utterly ridiculous, of course. But that doesnt necessarily have to spell disaster, pun not intended. 2012, The Day After Tomorrow, and Armageddon were each borne out of central ideas that were equally, if not more, outlandish as anything in Geostorm  but theyre all a blast. Its how the filmmakers choose to treat these ideas is what really matters  the tone they take, the pacing of it, how the actors pitch their performances, and whether or not we care about the characters.And Geostorm, for close to two agonising hours, routinely makes the wrong choices. Its dull, too earnest for its own good, and like Gerard Butlers 2016 gem Gods of Egypt, completely unaware of its own silliness. For Gods sake, its a movie in which a Scotsman, an Englishman and an Australian play Americans, an Irishman plays an Englishman, an Egyptian plays a Frenchman, and an American plays an Indian.Come.

While the total area under horticulture crops in the block is 2,000 to 2,200 hectares, 70 per cent of the land is under tomato cultivation.Wilt disease in the tomato crops was first reported from Sorda gram panchayat (GP) a fortnight back and now the disease is spreading to newer areas. Nuagaon Assistant Horticulture Officer (AHO), Soumya Pathak, and Assistant Agriculture Officer (AAO), P Mandal, visited some of the affected areas and confirmed the spread of the disease.Pathak said from symptoms in the affected plants, it appeared to be viral wilt disease and 25 to 30 per cent of the late kharif crop was affected. He said during inquiry, farmers admitted to repeating tomato cultivation on the same piece of land which increases chances of virus contamination and fungus attacks. He said tomato crops requires less labour with high returns, luring farmers to opt for it.An affected farmer, Nath Samad of Golatoli hamlet under Sorda, said he had invested about `1.25 lakh on growing tomatoes over three acres of land but a majority of the standing crops has been damaged by the wilt disease. Farmers such as Ganju Oram of Banki village in Chitapedi GP, Anil Ekka of Barilepta GP and Soma Lakra of Sorda GP have similar stories to tell.Pathak said they have asked the affected tomato farmers to immediately remove the plants which are affected by the disease to save healthy plants and avoid repeating planting the crop on the same piece of land. He said from an acre, farmers get 50 to 60 quintals of indigenous tomato varieties, while the yield is 250 to 300 quintals per acre for hybrid tomato crops.Panposh Assistant Horticulture Director (ADH) S P Nayak said spraying of pesticide was taken up by some farmers, but it did not work. It is impossible to contain the spread of the disease with any form of treatment, including pesticide application and the only viable option is to remove affected plants, he said, adding that a study would be conducted soon to assess the total crop damage.Nuagaon caters to bulk tomato requirement of Rourkela city and at present, the vegetable is priced at about Rs 50 per kg. Last year too, the tomato farmers of Nuagaon had faced loss in the shape of distress sale due to bumper crop."

Locals claim that the prices have gone beyond the budget of commoners as no vegetable is available at a rate below `60 per kg. The highest price is of tomatoes, which are selling at `80 per kg in Baripada town and nearby haats. The situation is no better at Rairangpur, Karanjia and Udala sub-divisions . Prices of locally-grown vegetables have also increased, locals said.The traders have linked the price rise to poor supply of vegetables from other States due to erratic rainfall. Contradicting traders, sources, however, claimed that local businessmen have created an artificial shortage of vegetables and managed to hike the prices, taking advantage of the huge demand for vegetables in the holy month. Meanwhile, commoners have apparently cut down their vegetable consumption.The price rise of vegetables has come as a major shock for my family, said Sumati Singh, a housewife. Almost all the vegetables were priced between `30 and `40 per kg three months back. Now, the prices of most of the vegetables have been doubled. Nowadays, a small family has to spend at least `500 to `600 for vegetables for an entire week. Earlier, we used to spend only `300 to `400 for a weeks consumption, said Manoj Sethi, a resident of Purunahatsahi Ward No. 6.At least 20 to 30 per cent vegetables demand is usually fulfilled by vegetable growers of Khuntapal, Kuliona and Pratapur from Barasahi area. The rest is met by supplies from other States. Now, the vegetable sellers of Gopiballhavpur in the neighbouring State of West Bengal and Tata in Jharkhand have been sending supplies to Baripada market and the three sub-divisions of the district, said a vegetable wholesaler.Locals, however, alleged that unscrupulous traders have hiked the prices in the absence of a proper market regulation mechanism.

During the auspicious month of Kartika, the soaring vegetable prices has hit the common man hard. During Kartika, most people avoid non-vegetarian food owing to religious beliefs.According to reports, the cheapest vegetable available in the market is ivy gourd (kunduri), which is priced at Rs 26 per kg. Brinjal and ladies finger cost Rs 50 and Rs 60 per kg, respectively. While beans come at a price of Rs 70 per kg, tomato is priced at Rs 60 per kg. Potato, the most popular vegetable, is being sold at Rs 16 per kg, thereby eating into the budget of the common man.The prices of vegetables are so high that I am contemplating to sell the rice, which I get at Rs 1 per kg, for my daily needs, said Prafulla Malik, a BPL villager of Gopabandhupur in the district. For him, selling the BPL rice is the only option as his daily earning is not enough to buy vegetable for his six-member family.

But we cannot afford to have non-vegetarian food daily, said Kathia Jena of Rajpur.The worst-hit are vegetarian hotels of the district. Dipu Nayak, owner of a vegetarian hotel, said, For the last few days, I am incurring a loss of Rs 500 on a daily basis. Now, I feel compelled to include non-vegetarian food in the menu to retain my customers.According to local traders, the vegetable market here depends on neighbouring States such as West Bengal, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh. Due to hike in prices of vegetables there, the market here has been affected, they said.The demand for vegetables has increased in the wake of marriage season and this is another reason for the price hike, said Valu Khanaa, a vegetable vendor. Sources in the Regulated Market Committee said vegetables worth Rs 7 lakh are sold in Bhadrak town daily. The sales double during marriage season.Sources said vegetable farming is being hardly given any importance in the district with over 95 per cent of vegetables being imported from other States. Deputy Director of Agriculture, Bhadrak, Tankadhar Behera said due to lack of storage and irrigation facilities, farmers show little interest in vegetable farming."

But, due to various reasons, the locally-produced vegetables fail to meet the demands. The town mostly depends on supplies from other States like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and West Bengal, wholesale vegetable traders said.Though vegetables are much in demand during this month, which is considered auspicious, this year their prices have almost doubled, said Manoranjan Sahu, a trader.The prices are likely to rise further as crops have been damaged due to the torrential rains in several areas, Sahu added.Pocket pinchRs 120 per kg for drumsticksThe price of bitter gourd price hovers between J60 and J70/kg.Beans and brinjal have been selling at J80 per kgNo vegetable is available at a price less than J40 per kg"

Today, he is reaping rich dividends from it. Apart from paddy cultivation, the father and son duo grows vegetable as well as fruits with help of two deep bore wells and are also into pisciculture.Prior to joining of Bismaya, Laxminarayan was cultivating paddy in only over five acres of land till 1999. He started vegetable farming in 2000 and cultivated pointed gourd (potal) in over half an acre of land and even managed to earn a profit of `20,000 in the first year. Subsequently, he ventured into cultivation of pumpkin, tomato as well as brinjal and expanded vegetable farming to over one and a half acres of land. Currently, the father-son duo earns a profit of about `50,000 per annum from vegetables only.Later, on being informed that pisciculture offers good returns, Laxminarayan dug up a tank in one acre of land with subsidised loan amounting to `90,000 from the Fisheries department. He spent `1.27 lakh to start pisciculture and released fish spawns of Rohu, Common Carp and Catla into the tank.Now, the father and son harvest around eight quintal of fish annually and earn a profit of about `50,000 per annum.After making up his mind to join his father, Bismaya decided to devote his entire time to farming activities and began banana cultivation in over one acre of land with support from National Horticulture Mission.Bismaya said they spent about `1.20 lakh to start banana cultivation with help of drip irrigation. In the first year of harvesting, they managed to recover the total expenditure. The saplings were provided free of cost by the Horticulture department along with subsidy on drip irrigation, he said.In the second year, the father-son duo earned a profit of `1 lakh after incurring an expenditure of `20,000. They have already earned a profit of more than `50,000 during the current year and the financial gain will cross `1 lakh, he said.Altogether, they earned a profit of about `2.5 lakh per annum, including profit of `50,000 from paddy cultivated over 10 acres as sharecroppers besides their own 3.5 acres of land.Buoyed by the profit from banana, Bismaya has planned to expand its cultivation to one and a half acres of more land from the next kharif season besides potal in over another half an acre.Bismaya said they face no problem in selling their produce as traders come to the village to procure it. I am happy after taking up farming as a profession and this decision of mine has proved to be a success, he added."

(Above): Workers in the final stages of pack gherkins with acid preservatives and vinegar in Ranebennuru in Haveri district, Karnataka. (Below) The gherkin is a demanding crop; even a one-day delay in picking the fruit makes it unviable. A farm hand in Ranebennuru, Haveri district.Sudhakara JainManzoor, a farmer barely in his 20s, picks up a small prickly fruit. He scrapes at its rough green skin, which is covered in hair. I know for sure you cant eat this, he says. He speaks of a large company, whose local agents contacted him with seeds, contracts and promises earlier this year. It is actually medicine, he adds, with some confidence. When he puts it down, he washes his hands thoroughly, and uses a stone to exfoliate the fingers. Pesticide, he says, corrodes the skin, turning it rough and whitish.Neat rows of strings and poles divide his one acre farm into grids. Water marks the channel in the middle, and the creepers clinging desperately to strings are beginning to wilt with disease.Manzoor is astonished to hear that people in other parts of the world eat the medicine that he grows. No one has told him that in the West, pickled gherkin is a condiment, as common on dining tables as pepper. Confounded, he calls his neighbours, who have been growing gherkins in their village Thimmapura in Haveri district, close to the River Tungabhadra in Central Karnataka. They laugh. No, it cannot be. When our children come here, we have to keep an eye on them. If they eat it, they will fall sick. It fills the stomach with gas, says Rajappa, another young farmer who has been growing gherkins for the past five years.The recent rains have transformed the undulating plains into a quilt of green. In these chequered fields sliced up only by roads and irrigation canals, rice, maize, sugarcane and millets have been the traditional crops. Its only over the past decade that the gherkins have slowly established a foothold.But the bad news is that this seasons crop has been washed out by unseasonal rains. The three gherkin crops in a year are typically grown from April to June, August to October, and December to February.Discussing gherkins with farmers inevitably leads to narratives of agrarian distress, migrations, and failed bore wells. Amid the vinegar flavours of gherkin processing centres in Karnakatas agro-processing zones spread across eight districts, managers and exporters list out their concerns. These range from the Goods and Service Tax, which shrinks their working capital, to the international outrage over Russian military aggression, to even the weather in Vietnam. A bumper crop in that country could affect the fortunes of the crop back home in India, and thus the lives of Manzoor and Rajappa.A crop like no otherWith little domestic demand, the foreign crop is like no other in the State, and perhaps in the country. Seeds sealed in neat packets are brought in all the way from Europe. Export companies engage farmers through contracts, and it is in the unpredictable agrarian environs of Karnataka that the alien fruit is birthed.The fruit, however, undergoes a series of chemical treatments before being shipped thousands of miles again, with its final destination ranging from the restaurants of Madrid to the supermarkets of Manhattan.In the 1990s, as information technology (IT) and the outsourcing boom transformed Bengaluru, a few hundred kilometres away, exporters found in the relative warmth of districts such as Kolar and Bagepalli the perfect conditions for the cultivation of gherkins. Just like the IT boom, this one, too, was founded on cheap labour.For more than a decade, this sector saw on average an annual growth rate of 20%. Export companies popped up like mushrooms in food parks and SEZs. While banks announced special loans, agriculture policies dangled special incentives, and gherkin contract farming spread across the State. The gherkin revolution has turned many impoverished farmers into lakhpathis, stated a 2006 report by the Institute for Social and Economic Change (ISEC) in 2006.By 2014, over 1.31 lakh farmers in southern India were engaged in gherkin cultivation. The sectors exports touched Rs. 1,200 crore, an impressive feat considering that a decade ago, exports were barely worth Rs. 180 crore.When it was dropped into the State two decades ago, the fruit did not have a local name. Now it goes by the odd term medicine cucumber. Most say that it is a corruption of the Kannada word,midi, meaning small. Farmers in areas where gherkins are just making an entry into the landscape think that the name is on account of it being made into medicine (some believe it cures piles), or, perhaps, because the fruit leaves a bitter aftertaste, like a tablet.Karnataka, where gherkin cultivation covers 20 out of the 30 districts, accounts for more than 60% of Indias production, with the neighbouring States of Andhra Pradesh, Maharasthra and Tamil Nadu chipping in.Similar to the dynamics in the IT sector, where a policy announcement on the other side of the world tends to echo through the air-conditioned corridors of Bengaluru, the gherkin industry is also highly vulnerable to the headwinds of global events.The Russia problemIn 2014, parts of central Karnataka saw copious monsoon rains even as large parts of the State battled drought. The perfect conditions yielded a bumper crop. But just a few months before the monsoons arrived, something unexpected happened: Russian soldiers took over the courthouses and government buildings of Crimea.The Russian annexation of Crimea had begun. Despite international outrage, a referendum was conducted. Eventually, a pro-Russia government was installed to govern the peninsula where no gherkins are grown.As Russia faced sanctions from Europe and America, suddenly, Indias largest importer of gherkins found itself unable to afford the fruit. Thousands of miles away, in nondescript villages of Karnataka where news from the outside world is hard to come by, company agents were suddenly obsessed with the Russia crisis.A conversation in Hemodre, a village in drought-prone Sira taluk near the Andhra Pradesh border, triggers an impromptu gathering of curious farmers. Beeresh, 30, the local agent, is called in to explain the dynamics of gherkin cultivation in the village.Beereshs job is to talk to farmers, perhaps even give loans (sometimes from his own pocket), so that they shift to gherkin cultivation. He has to ensure enough produce to meet the targets, which are decided by the companies based on the export orders they have received. The credit he gives to the farmers is later deducted from the payments made for the gherkin produce.I used to contract 250 farmers. But due to the Russia problem and other issues, we were asked to cut down on acreage as demand dipped. Now there are 150 farmers, but they dont do it regularly enough, he says. With the cut in supply, his commissions have dropped. He is now in a debt of more than Rs. 2 lakh, which he hopes to pay off when the market stabilises.About 200 km away, in a recently refurbished factory that sticks out incongruously in the maize and sugarcane fields of southern Ballari district, the air smells of the acid preservatives in which gherkins are stored.Srinivas R., the factory manager, explains what happened when Crimea was annexed. In 2014-15, the factory handled 14,000 tonnes. We prepared for a bumper crop, and suddenly the orders dipped. The rouble had crashed, from 38 to 83 roubles to a dollar. The Russians were no longer able to buy gherkins in bulk from here. We had tonnes of gherkins with no buyers, he says. Within a year, the acreage sown in the area reduced by 40%.The setback reverberated through company balance sheets. Exports to Russia came down from Rs. 234 crore in 2014-15 to just Rs. 90 crore in 2016-17. Russia remains the key, for it is the only importing country that takes lower-grade gherkins which are often rejected by European buyers.The crisis devastated the industry. At least five companies with significant investments  some owned by hotel, telecom and steel tycoons  have folded up. These are difficult times, compounded by international and domestic problems, says Mune Gowda, who heads Exotic Agro Pvt. Ltd., and is the Treasurer of the Indian Gherkin Exporter's Association. Even the U.S. has started importing from Mexico, while Vietnam is catching up in gherkin production, he says. In the past three years, a quarter of the gherkin farmers have stopped production for various reasons, estimates the association. Production has dipped by over 70,000 metric tonnes. Making up for the loss of the Russian market by tapping the European one proved difficult as the latter is choosy and has strict compliance norms and certification requirements.The foreignerDomestically, cultivating gherkins comes with its own problems. Unpredictable weather takes a toll on the crop. The gherkin itself is a demanding crop that takes its pound of flesh from the land on which it is sown. It acts like a foreigner who lives here, says Ranganath at Hemodre village. He is relatively less enamoured of the cucumber. He is not taken in by the promise of high yields. If the wind changes direction for an hour, it falls sick, he says.Gherkins need constant care, which isnt easy given the harsh realities of farming in India: monsoons are erratic and prone to failure; rural distress has sparked large-scale migrations and reduction in the availability of labour; tropical diseases sweep across large tracts; and groundwater reserves are dwindling. This constant battle has made the farmers christen the fruitkiri kiritarakari(irritating vegetable) andsoutekaye savasa(problematic cucumber).A little more than a month after the seeds are sown, gherkins pop out of the base of the flower, yielding fruits incessantly for the next two months.It is here that the trouble begins. If it is not picked within a few hours of flowering, it grows exponentially in size, and for the farmers, the bigger it is, the smaller their returns. The gherkins are graded according to their size and there are five grades in all. The smallest gherkins (160 of them can fit in a crate) could fetch Rs. 32 per kilo. The biggest (less than 30 in a crate) fetch just Rs. 2. If transportation of the plucked gherkins is delayed, up to one-third of the produce could be lost.We need 15 labourers a day just to pick the fruit. Most of the youth have gone to Bengaluru or Hyderabad for jobs. If we delay the picking by one day, the gherkin grows and becomes unviable for us, said 41-year-old Siddarameshwara in the remote Udramappanahalli village of Sira taluk. His crop this year has been ravaged by mildew, which sets upon gherkins when it rains.Its because of these reasons that despite his success with the crop in the past 10 years, he has confined gherkins to just 0.5 acres of his 12-acre farm. As white, stringy fungus envelops the gherkin, he hopes that the winter crop can compensate for his loss. However, in the slight chill of the winter lurks the melon fly which, farmers say, no quantity of pesticide can effectively contain.More disconcertingly, the crop guzzles water. If the field is not irrigated daily, gherkins become shrivelled and bent, unsuitable for export. For the 50 days or so that it flowers, farmers have to draw water from their borewells. If maize needs water thrice in two weeks, the gherkin needs it every day. Maize is grown twice a year; gherkins thrice a year. For all the three seasons to yield sizeable profits, it needs more than 150 days of irrigation.The guru of gherkinsEight years ago, it was the sight of a group of Spaniards inspecting gherkins in Bagepalli, just 100 km from Bengaluru close to the Andhra Pradesh border, that enthralled villagers. Taking them around the clusters of gherkin villages was B. Srinivas, whose company acted as a conduit for the bigger companies and farmers. The Spaniards had told the gherkin growers that the produce here was the best they had seen.Having taken to the gherkin sector in 1998, it was he and a small band of agents who persuaded farmers to try this new crop. Agents and company facilitators propped up. Bollywood-style films on gherkin management were shown to farmers to attract them to the crop. Gherkins, it was believed, could lift the region out of poverty.Srinivas remembers the gherkin rush. Farmers would line up for seeds. We could even do large swathes of 30 acres in each village. Things were easy back then.Over 1,000 acres of gherkins  a limit constrained only by the volume of the companies export orders  were sown in 2006-07. Money flowed as advances to farmers, agents kept a steep commission from the output, and for farmers, gherkins did translate into money.Then the inevitable happened. By the late 2000s, the rains started failing, and one by one, the borewells went dry. Groundwater dipped in places from 400 feet to more than 1,200 feet. In places where the borewells ran through the summer, they now stopped two months before the rains, and later, didnt function even in the winter. Gherkins, with their immediate need for water, were the first to be affected.By 2011, the number of red farmers  those with debts  rose dramatically, and the agents had to look farther for suitable land, with some going as far as Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh. It just didnt work out. We would get half an acre in one village and a couple of acres elsewhere far away. The debts kept rising. I had to get out, Srinivas says.In the hustle of the Bagepalli market, the man who many farmers and agents say was the guru of gherkins in the region now runs an agro-business focussing only on traditional vegetables and maize seeds. Just three agents operate now, and struggle to cumulatively cover 50 acres.Cycles of debtDrought and international price fluctuations have left behind a cycle of debt  unpaid loans for field agents and gherkin farmers, who, in turn, have to pledge a greater share of future gherkin production.In the past decade, the prices of the seeds, all imported, went up from 6 paise to 68 paise per seed. If tomato seeds cost Rs. 700 for 10,000, the cost for gherkins is up to Rs. 10,000. The returns, however, havent kept up. In the same period, the price of premium gherkins has gone up from Rs. 8 to Rs. 32 per kg.In some areas, agents have racked up debts of more than Rs. 50 lakh. Agents like Gangappa in Bagepalli who claims to have nearly Rs. 70 lakh in debt from farmers in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, have pinned their hopes on the recent rains that have filled up tanks. They hope that these farmers can repay the debt by cultivating gherkins again.The rains have indeed given life to the dry lands of Bagepalli, Sira and central Karnataka, which glimmer now in various shades of green. There is slight optimism in the corporate offices of exporters too: a steady year can blunt Indias reputation as an uncertain producer that frequently misses shipment dates. But is it possible that, somehow, the U.S. and Russia would normalise relations and bring Indian gherkins back on Russian tables?Well, the fruit is fickle and vulnerable, and uncertainties loom, much like the dark vestigial monsoon clouds that threaten to wash out this seasons crop.I used to contract 250 farmers. But due to the Russia problem and other issues, we were asked to cut down on acreage as demand dipped. Now there are 150 farmers, but they dont do it regularly enough.BeereshA local agentEven the U.S. has started importing from Mexico, while Vietnam is catching up in gherkin production.Mune GowdaHead, Exotic Agro Pvt.

Even those not knowing the language are sure that I am singing from my heart, he explains settling down for a quick lunch at The Parks Fire restaurant. When I sing in other languages, I do it phonetically but am unable to put my soul behind it. This gets translated to the audience as they know kuch toh fake kar raha hai, he quips.After a quick look at the menu, Raghu asks for Caesar salad with lots of lettuce, kothamalli pestro, baby mozzarella and cherry tomatoes while agreeing to try Andhra quinoa and beetroot, suggested by the staff. Back to the point, he observes, Before singing, I always explain the lyrics. The language barrier is only for the first few minutes then it takes a back seat as audience feel assured with our passionate singing. The other day I sang for 150 people with just my guitar and other accompaniments. Yet, I made people sing Kannada songs.He maintains lyrics are the prime reason for his bands success in India and abroad as the songs have philosophical and positive messages. I dont do it deliberately as they are already embedded in the poems on which I compose music. He explains with examples. In Gudugudiya Sedi Nodo, poet Santa Shishunala Sharif asks how does one feel after smoking hookah in which materialistic pursuits are burnt in a chillum called faith. Youngsters realising the poems gravity remark, That is really deep. Similarly, the song Lokada Kaalaji Maaduthinanthi, by the same poet says, dont worry and be happy in life. Relatable, the audience connect to it. He feels even if two out of 10 are drawn to know about these poets and their writings, he feels happy. Today, as soon as we release a new song, my hardcore fans immediately want to know the meaning.Colourful attireThe colourful and printed lungis and dhotis of band members also make Raghu Dixit Project stand out. It is a take off from what I learnt in Bharatanatyam. Its aharya abhinaya relates to costumes and make-up. I incorporated these dresses to highlight who we are. I wear bells on my feet as it is rhythmic. Moreover, the dress gives us a unique look which is unlike other groups who perform in jeans and T shirts.The Caesar salad is laid out. It is fresh and light, he remarks. Not very fussy about food, he prefers Southern cuisines like Manglorean and Chettinad. I like rasam, sambar, idli, dosa, bisi bele bath, yengai and puliyodharai. In fact, curd rice can carry me anywhere in the world. What about Andhra food? As it is spicy, I dont eat it regularly but do so when suffering from severe cold. Believe me, one meal and it simply vanishes, he jests.Describing himself a decent cook, the singer reveals he learnt the art during his bachelor days. I would call up my mother in Mysore and ask for recipes and directions. Hit and trial and pots of luck made me learn this art which though similar to singing is much tougher. Elucidating, he explains: Both need ones heart and soul and they have to be done for joy and not for commercial gains. The two help in building lasting human relationships. On our tours, fans invite us to share lunch and dinner with them. Once desperate to have rasam in New York, I posted a request on the Facebook. I instantly received 30 invitations!Surprisingly, Raghu doesnt follow a strict diet. I eat everything vegetarian, including street food, like gol gappe, chaat, dahi bhalle, vada pav and misil pav. Perceiving my surprise, he explains, The throat should get used to everything to make it immune to ill-effects. Now he is speaking like a microbiologist. For the uninitiated, Raghu is a post graduate in Microbiology and worked for years in Belgium before moving to singing. Trying the Andhra quinoa and beetroot, he reveals, I learned Bharatanatyam for 18 years and once wanted to be a professional dancer. It was a challenge by a friend to do something macho like singing and playing guitar instead of dancing that made me turn to music. I learnt to sing 500 Miles Away From Home with a guitar in two weeks flat much to the friends surprise. Then I realised what a beautiful thing it is to play an instrument and sing. I became aware I had a voice and it is nice to sing. Felt like breaking barriers and do whatever I wanted to.Appetising journeyStill stage performances, cutting albums and composing for films like Chef , was a distant dream. Working in Belgium, Raghus landlord asked him to lend his recordings. I gave him a CD of songs I had written and sung in India which he sent to Radio 21 . It was well received and I was flooded by calls and mails asking for more . That set me thinking. If I could impress people who did not understand a word of what I am singing, then things could be better. Ten days later he quit and returned to India. I had been collaborating with my friend Bhaskar and had no band. So I quickly put together one. Named Antragani, we played in front of an audience of 40000. What an experience! relates Raghu.The group was later disbanded and he formed Raghu Dixit Project which cut albums, Raghu Dixit Project and Jag Changa. The project is a novel initiative as it is an open house for people to join to collaborate and continue till they wish to. It is a fluid arrangement and outfit and is working well, he reveals.With filmmakers opting for independent musicians to score for movies, Raghu got his chance. Besides Kannada and Tamil, he composed music for Mujhse Fraaandship Karoge and Bewakoofiyaan . His latest is Saif Ali Khan-starrer Chef for which he composed and also sang songs with Shugal Laga Le becoming quite popular. Initially, director Raja Menon asked me to compose one song which I disagreed as I wanted to compose the entire score. He gave me the script and I produced scratches which he liked immensely. Describing composing for movies challenging, Raghu says, Film music is bound by its storyline, characters and situations unlike independent music. The upshot is you can reach a wider audience. The group also appeared in the film. Calling it fun, he says, Raja asked us to fly to Mumbai to perform Shugal Laga Le. Saif was absolutely cool during shooting and the scenes and song were shot much to Rajas satisfaction.One assumes Chefs popular appeal will ensure more filmy collaborations. Live performances are and will be my first preference, he sums up before rushing for rehearsals."

But the country still has some distance to cover in terms of exports as post-harvest wastage of produce in India is high.In 2015, the Modi government started project CHAMAN  acronym for Coordinated Horticulture Assessment and Management using geo-informatics  to prepare a comprehensive horticultural plan. Using remote sensing technology to study soil conditions, land use, weather and cropping patter, the Centre has chosen 185 districts across the country where seven selected crops are being promoted.Once complete, the findings of the project would be shared with all states to give to boost to cultivation of horticultural crops.States put into groupsDifferent states have been divided into different groups to grow banana, mango, citrus fruits, potato, tomato, onion and chilli.Sharing the progress of the project CHAMAN at a press briefing, Mr Singh said the Centre would convene a meeting of the northeastern states by January next year as the report on horticulture development for this region was ready.This sector provides nutrient rich crops to the people and better remunerative prices to the farmers and increases their incomes, Mr. Singh said.Under CHAMAN, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat and Maharashtra have been identified as the major banana-growing states. Mango cultivation is being promoted in Andhra, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana, while onion is the focus for Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh."

The World War II shelter in Clapham, which could protect up to 8,000 people from Nazi German bombs, consists of two large tunnels that were intended to one day become an extension of the London Underground.That never happened and the shelter lay abandoned for 70 years until two entrepreneurs, Steven Dring and Richard Ballard, decided to grow broccoli, coriander, fennel and a host of other vegetables as so-called micro leaves, also known as micro herbs, grown from seedlings but harvested early when the first leaves form. We need to create these new fertile spaces to meet increased demand from a growing global population, Dring said on a visit to the Growing Underground site -- some 33 metres below the road.The vegetables are grown with hydroponics, using nutrient solutions in a water solvent instead of soil. The technique can also be used to grow a wide range of produce, including tomatoes and baby peppers, Dring said.The only other ingredient required is light. The tunnels have no natural light and are illuminated with pink LEDs, giving them a futuristic look.The intensity of the light changes to imitate daylight, but with one major difference -- the lights are dimmed during the day and shine brightest at night, as electricity is cheapest then. We predominantly grow micro herbs, which are standard herbs, from different seeds. But what we do is we grow them to a very small stage, before the first true leaves start to come out, Dring said.The micro herb broccoli takes between three and five days to grow before being packaged up in the shelter and sent off. Fans enthuse about the intensity of the flavours of the produce.Dring and Ballard latched onto the concept of vertical farming -- producing food in vertically stacked layers -- which was developed by US biologist Dickson Despommier in his 2010 book The Vertical Farm: Feeding the World in the 21st Century.The operation takes up some 200 metres of the 1,000 metres available in the air-raid shelter tunnel, half for growing while the other half is used for packaging. Their request to use the air-raid shelter in Clapham was eagerly taken up by the owners of the space, Londons public transport company.This type of farming is 100 times cheaper than setting up an urban farm on the surface, Dring said.Experts say vertical and urban farming could be ways not only of facing up to population growth but also growing urbanisation worldwide as well as climate change.The Growing Underground project sends its data on humidity, temperature and plant growth to Cambridge University to try and improve efficiency. What these guys are doing is modelling for us which one is the optimum environment for each product, Dring said. Every day is the same in the underground farm and there are no seasons, or unpredictable British weather."

To ensure better price for such farmers, a separate market was indeed necessary. As there would be huge demand for organic products, it is necessary for farmers to be transparent and committed.There is also the possibility of farmers deviating from the responsibilities and getting into the routine farming to meet the demand for supply using pesticides and fertilisers. Officials should be thoroughly invigilating and ensure that the organic farm products are only supplied in the market.He urged the farmers to take up organic farming to keep people away from diseases like cancers.District admin supportDeputy Commissioner Priyanka Mary Francis said Savayava Santhe will be held on Sundays. Non-certified materials should not be permitted. The produce would get better price and all marketing facilities will be provided by the district administration. The area would be made an organic hub. Around two tonnes of organic vegetables and fruits were sold out in barely two hours in the first market, she added.The Savayava Santhe had organic vegetables, foodgrains and fruits from Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Chikkamagaluru districts. Six organic farming clusters are established in Udupi district and 632 farmers have been practising organic farming on 655 hectares of land since 2013-14 under the Savayava Bhagya Yojane introduced by state government. The clusters include Hirebettu, Kadur, Kattingeri in Udupi, and Belinje in Karkala and Japti and Yelajith in Kundapur. Under the project, a Dakshina Kannada, Chikkamagaluru and Udupi Districts Regional Cooperative Organic Farmers Associations Federation is set up.The farmers in these clusters grow organic rice like Rajamudi and Kempakki and other products like rice flakes, organic jaggery, pulses, millets like navane, sajje, baragu, ragi, oodhalu, harake, organic vegetables and fruits, including tomato, ladies finger, gherkins, elephant yam, green chilli, leafy vegetables, bitter gourd, ash gourd, pomegranate, chikoo, beans, bananas and spices like onion, garlic, cardamom and pepper.There are 200 members in Dakshina Kannada, Chikkamagaluru and Udupi Districts Regional Cooperative Organic Farmers Associations Federation. Under the Federation, there are six organisations in Udupi, 11 in Dakshina Kannada and 27 in Chikkamagaluru. There are 3,000 hectares of farm land in the three districts earmarked to grow organic products.Farmers who grow organic products are certified by the organisation based in Bengaluru. There would be three years observation, after two years, the farmer can apply for the certification.The farmers are also into organic farming under the Paramparagatha Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) of the Union government in nine villages in Udupi district since 2015-16. As many as 292 farmers are following organic farming in 108 hectares of land under this scheme."
5a14e3fa9855b76bf13e8ceb,Wilderness on a,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/wilderness-on-a/article19904074.ece,2017-10-23,,The Hindu,"Every time Prateek Sadhu, executive chef at Mumbai-based restaurant Masque, pays the mountains a visit, he returns with close to a 100 kg of sea buckthorn, a modest Himalayan shrub with numerous medicinal benefits. Typically used by locals to construct fences, he converts the plant  also known as the Leh berry  into flavourful concoctions like citrusy-creamy sea buckthorn with black pepper mousse. Since Masques launch in 2016, exotic culinary delights  with seasonal foraged veggies like fiddleheads, wild cherries and tree tomatoes  have become top favourites among food enthusiasts. When you have such amazing produce, ideas come easily. The focus of Masque is to scale up the farm-to-table concept in India, and with people open to experimenting, the concept has caught on. Initially, our audience was restricted to Mumbai, but now travellers from across the globe recognise us as a dining destination, says Aditi Dugar, CEO, Masque.Inspired by Rene Redzepis (of Copenhagens Noma) foraging exploits, food lovers across Indias culinary landscape are bringing wild produce such as mud crabs and ghingharoo berries to city kitchens, and the trend is here to stay. According to Mumbai-based food writer, Vikram Doctor, the monsoon serves as the perfect season to forage, especially for tribal and farming communities. As they cant fish or farm, foraged food comes to the rescue of many communities who face a food crisis during this season, he says.For Pooja Pangtey and Teiskhem (Tei) Lynrah  the folks that started Mumbai-based pop-up restaurant, Meraki, last year  the art of foraging allows them to present unsuspecting Mumbaikars with a glimpse into the culturally rich kitchens of the Northeast. The knowledge handed down from our village folk has kept us connected with our culture, says Pangtey, who has introduced dishes with timila (wild figs) and kafal (red bayberries). In typical community-style dining, every edition of Merakis pop-ups follows a storytelling format where dishes like Wa khapa (Garo ginger pork) are presented coupled with a brief anecdote about their ingredients. When you read a book, you imagine what the author is trying to say. We wanted to create a similar experience, and were happy to see a change in the way locals think about what they grow, forage or eat, and what the city folk think about this type of food. Perceptions like people from the Northeast just eat a lot of meat are also changing, says Pangtey.Culture popForaging in India is anything but a new-age phenomenon, explains Doctor. We have a very long tradition of using foraged foods, and even today, women from tribal communities harbour most of the available knowledge on such edibles. Urmila Pawar, a Dalit writer from Konkan, writes about how women in her community would look for oysters on the coast; a treat they relish, he says. Foraging has also remained an integral part of religious rituals across the country. In the Angalaamman legend in Tamil Nadu, the goddess cooks a dish fromAgathileaves and chicken blood. Apparently, this dish is still prepared in certain temples as an offering to the deity, he adds.Beyond kitchensThe potent exercise of foraging isnt simply restricted to the kitchen. Kush Sethi, who heads digital communications for the Delhi Walk Festival, conducts foraging walks (between September and February). Venues include Lodhi Garden to discover edible plants  like wild amaranth and common mallow  that have been labelled weeds. Sethis motivation stems from his interest in studying weeds in an urban landscape, free from interventions like fertilisation and irrigation. Labelling a plant as a weed renders it useless and encourages people to litter in such spaces. But if someone promotes a particular plant as medicinal, the whole perception changes, says Sethi.Mumbai-based travel company, Kipepeo, also incorporates foraging walks in all its community-based tour itineraries. The idea stemmed from a conversation the founder, Piran Elavia, had with a tourist; and what followed was the creation of a product that puts the emphasis on local cuisine of the Northeast. I was surprised by the kind of vegetarian food people there forage and consume. They boil produce like the stinging nettle and flowers of the Nakima plant with rice, herbs, and some even add meat, says Elavia, who conducts foraging walks every six months.Fresh experimentsThe flavour these wild edibles lend to dishes and their presentation is what makes foraging a much-loved activity for chefs. Dugar, for instance, talks about their experiments at Masque with chestnuts. We foraged them along with the thorny shell and now have a range of dishes, like the chestnut brle served inside a chestnuts shell, chestnut and cacicovallo cheese (from Andhra Pradesh) and wild wood sorrel, explains Dugar. This foraging philosophy often finds its way to their bar as well. The bartender will try to use the same ingredients the kitchen is working with. For instance, while getting the sea buckthorn back in a carton, a lot of the juice had settled at the bottom. The bartender sieved it with a muslin cloth and infused gin-based drinks with it.Pangtey, who interacts with botanists who connect her with locals, explains how being well versed with local traditions is important, especially when exhibiting facets of a lesser known culture. In Uttarakhand, for example, there are close to 230 varieties of kidney beans. A lot of this produce is consumed by the families who grow them.Tracing the tightropeForaging, as enriching and lucrative as it sounds, presents its practitioners an equal share of challenges. The biggest being the short shelf life of the edibles.Countering this uncertainty, the people at Masque avoid getting a standard menu printed. The menu is often planned according to ingredients that reach the kitchen table. While there is a wishlist and its disappointing if we are not able to get that produce, we love the uncertainty that comes with foraging, says Dugar. For Sethi, explaining a seemingly unknown concept like foraging to commoners in order to get permissions to conduct walks, is the biggest hurdle. But weve got our secrets to deal with it! he says.Meanwhile, food historian and critic, Odette Mascarenhas says foraging demands a fair share of responsible execution. Our new-generation palate has been more open to exploration, and chefs are catering to that. But the preparations authenticity must remain intact, she insists. Though everything is subject to experiment, being the traditionalist that she prides herself to be, for her its imperative that something of the past is retained.You can reach Masque at022-2499 1010, Meraki at meraki.bombay@gmail.com,Kush Sethi, www.delhiwalkfestival.com and Kipepeo, www.facebook.com/kipepeo.india/When you have such amazing produce,ideas come easily.

Sreenivasa MurthyPeople who wanted to get back to their routine diet after Deepavali festivities were in for a rude shock. A steep increase in vegetable prices have ensured that there is no post-festival cheer that is usually the phenomenon when it comes to the prices of fruits and vegetables. Buying greens, especially, could burn a deep hole in your pocket.M. Vishwanath, managing director, Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS), said there had been a 20 to 40% increase in the prices of vegetables compared with last week.The steepest rise has been in the price of tomato, which costs Rs. 52 a kg now, and greens come at Rs. 150 to Rs. 200 a kg. Coriander, for example, costs Rs. 160 a kg now, he said.Prices of most vegetables are being reported to have nearly doubled in a month. Venkatesh G.M., manager at a supermarket chain, said the rates of tomatoes, for example, was up from Rs. 20 a kg last month to Rs. 45.The copious rainfall in Bengaluru and places around it such as Kolar, Chickballapur, Nelamangala, Malur, and Doddaballapur received in the last few weeks is said to be one of the contributing factors, mainly affecting the greens. In the wholesale market, coriander costs Rs. 160 to Rs. 180 a kg (from Rs. 100 about a fortnight ago), spinach Rs. 110 kg (from Rs. 60) and fenugreek Rs. 140 (from Rs. 60). Even beans costs Rs. 60 a kg, up from Rs. 40. During the festival, the rate had gone up to Rs. 80 and it should have normalised by now, said Mr. Venkatesh.The continuous rain since mid-August is said to have affected the late crops, as well as the new crops. The prices are expected to stabilise in about two months.We will have to wait for three months to get enough vegetables, said K. Srinivasa Gowda, a farmer in Kolar.Though vegetable prices in Kolar, a major centre of supplying vegetables to Bengaluru, have gone up owing to low yield following the recent rains, the rainfall is likely to help boost farming in the long run, with farmers having ample water for the summer months."

Prices that shot up after recent rains continue to remain high, deterring customers, the sellers say.K.V.S. GiriK.V.S. GIRIVegetable prices in the city continue to remain perched at increased rates despite monsoon withdrawal from the State nearing completion.Prices in the city increased during the first few days of October even as supply was affected. Vendors attributed the poor quality and high price of some commonly consumed vegetables to rains. A check of prices in government retail as well as wholesale markets suggested prices continue to pinch the common man.High quantityThough the quality and quantity has improved, the prices continue to be high. Customers have cut down on their purchase, said Venu Naik, a vegetable seller in Sainikpuri. The effect of rains in grower regions continue to affect prices.For instance, at the Bowenpally vegetable market, the arrival of hybrid variant of tomato had nearly doubled since the start of the month, accompanied with a three-time price increase. The variant was selling for a maximum price of Rs. 48 per kilo in the wholesale market. In retail markets however, the price was about Rs. 75 per kilo.The local variant of tomato is selling over Rs. 65 per kilo while the wholesale price stands at about Rs. 32 per kilo.Different pricesWhile potato and onion prices did not register a high, the cost of carrot continue to remain higher than its price last month. A kilo at Bowenpally market was listed at Rs. 55 on Tuesday. Carrot price in Rythu Bazars was around Rs. 70 with the private retail market demanding about Rs. 5 higher.The price of French bean at around Rs. 100 in the local private market, also remains higher than that of last month."

Only potato is available for Rs 13 per kg, giving a sigh relief to consumers. Even coriander leaf has become dearer by Rs 32 while green chilly is being sold at Rs 30 per kg.""I was shocked to see the prices of vegetables at Rythu Bazaar. Tomatoes which were being sold at Rs 13 per kg a week ago is now priced at Rs 30. Brinjals, which were being sold at Rs 18 a kg a few days ago, is now being sold at Rs 34 per kg, said S Dhanalakshmi, a homemaker.The exorbitant prices will continue for another two or three weeks till the end of Karthika Masam, claim traders. Till then, people have to bear the brunt of sky-rocketing prices.The month is famous for Vanabhojanam and Deekshas and many other traditions in the Hindu calendar. People observe fast and consume only vegetables, said N Veerababu, a trader at Rythu Bazar. When contacted, Rythu Bazar officials said the market procures vegetables from the neighbouring villages of Krishna and Guntur district on a daily basis and all those areas have seen bumper productions.They claimed that vegetable farmers would not suffer much loss as vegetable crops are harvested in phases. After a fortnight, the prices would stabilise bringing relief to the growers, they said."
5a14fe979855b76bf13e9b4b,"Fiscal recipe for growth: cut taxes, push up public spend",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/637237/fiscal-recipe-growth-cut-taxes.html,2017-10-10,,Deccan Herald,"Fiscal recipe for growth: cut taxes, push up public spendBy Ajit Ranade, Oct 10 2017, 23:59 ISTThe most important thing is to acknowledge the economic slowdown. For the past six quarters, the growth rate has steadily gone down from 9.2% to 5.7%. Investment as a share of GDP has been declining for five years. Job creation may not be just at a standstill, but sliding backwards. To some extent, this can all be viewed as the price to pay for the structural transformation of the economy. The price is paid in terms of political capital. Long-term measures have been undertaken, which have short-term costs, and can prove costly in electoral terms, too.A unified tax structure, direct linkage of farmers to buyers, attack on black money, determined effort to widen the tax net, financial inclusion, the move toward a less-cash economy are all steps toward a stronger and more efficient economic system in the longer term. But the government might be guilty of completely neglecting the here and now in pursuit of the long-term vision. After all, some of the jobs lost now are lost forever.Meals not served in restaurants during demonetisation wont come back in the future.When prices of perishables like tomatoes crash to Rs 3 a kilo, that is not compensated by better prices in the future. Many daily wage labourers who didnt find a job lost that livelihood, even if temporarily. Statistics confirm that all four basic drivers of growth (and spending) are sputtering: consumer spending, foreigner spending (that is, our exports), investment spending, and now even government spending.Economic revival is as much about psychology as about macroeconomic policy. Rising consumer and business confidence feeds off itself, and can lead to a virtuous cycle. The government and its spokespersons have as much responsibility to restore and enhance that confidence as to actually implement growth-enhancing policies. It helps to have credible promises and action plans, not just platitudes that all will be ok, this pain is only short-term.In times like these, it helps to refer to the eminent modern guru of economic policy, John Maynard Keynes. He understood that investors and consumers are as much moved by psychology as by economic incentives. Indians by nature are optimistic, as revealed by many global surveys, but that is not helping in the current times. The 80-year old wisdom of Keynesian economics still holds, despite many attempts to malign or discredit it. It is also no use being alarmist on Indias already high fiscal deficit ratio. Indias debt to GDP ratio is middling, and eminently sustainable. The pause in fiscal restraint fits in well with the new conventional wisdom put forth by worthies like the IMF in the wake of the European debt crisis.There is, of course, a price to pay for fiscal loosening. That price could be in terms of higher taxes in the future (to pay for new debt), or higher inflation. Both of these are acceptable costs. The unborn generation will bear a lower per-capita burden of taxes because of our demography. We can afford a slightly higher inflation rate, given that it has undershot even the RBIs target band.Finally, it is unfair to pin all our hopes on monetary loosening, and ignore the fiscal possibilities altogether. We need a well thought-out, well designed and implemented fiscal push now, not later.Revival packageSo, here is a list of fiscal options recommended as a much-needed timely fiscal package. First, recapitalisation of public sector banks. Burdened by NPAs, they are simply not in a position to extend new loans. This has caused credit growth to fall to the lowest in decades. The incremental credit-to-deposit ratio is deeply negative. Of course, we need not give the banks a blank cheque, so to speak. The recapitalisation could be tied to conditions and milestones, such as a time-bound resolution of top 10 NPAs, or speedy decisions on haircuts on stressed loans.The second area of fiscal priority is lower taxes. The corporate sector awaits the lower rate of 25%. More importantly, the excessive excise taxation on petrol and diesel must be reversed. Granted, it is in the domain of state taxes and that it lies outside the ambit of the GST council, but we need urgent relief on petro taxes. These are indirect taxes; they hurt the poor more than the rich, are regressive, do not give GST offset credit, and feed into generalised inflation through higher logistics and energy costs. Theres no point in filling the coffers of the governments and oil companies, and denying the benefits to the citizen.The third area is affordable housing. That will need a subsidy, mostly in land cost and interest subvention. The land should be acquired by governments (thats where thesubsidy comes in), and housing loan interest rate can be reduced. The state of Kerala has a successful pilot which can be emulated. Maharashtra is also implementing a large project, which includes rental housing, too.The fourth priority is a wage subsidy, especially for labour-intensive sectors like textiles (weaving, spinning, garment-making), construction and tourism. The state of Odisha has successfully innovated a scheme for garment makers which can be emulated. The NREGA can be extended to the textile sector. Wage subsidy and national accreditation should be given to apprentices, too, because most of the skilling is actually done as on the job training.A fifth priority is exporters. The issue of delay in GST refund has already been flagged. An expansion of the MEIS and SEIS schemes could be looked into. The fate of manufacturing and the export sector are interlinked.The sixth priority is farm incomes. Raising the MSP is a much-politicised issue. But there are crops outside the ambit of MSP. The government must examine ways of providing floor price support, although this helps only farmers with surplus to sell. There are many other specific measures to address the immediate need to rev up the economy. A fiscal push, in terms of lower taxes and higher government spending is an imperative.(The writer is an economist and senior fellow, Takshashila Institution)(The Billion Press)"

(Express Photo by Ratan Lal) Children eating mid-day meal at the school Santoshi was enrolled in. They were served rice, pulses, and a soyabean-potato curry; policemen provided for Santoshis familys security following threats from villagers. (Express Photo by Ratan Lal)Her hair brushed back, a comb tucked in her bun, Gudiya (26) is at ease this Tuesday afternoon. People from the administration are hovering around her, while six policemen keep a vigil on visitors. Officials from Jaldega block in Jharkhands Simdega district, a Naxal-dominated area, have come to the house in Karimati village to help the family encash a cheque of Rs 50,000 given by the administration to Gudiyas mother, Koyli Devi (45). They escort her to the bank located at Jaldega, where Koyli is told she can withdraw the money next week.Breastfeeding the youngest of her children, a two-and-a-half-year-old boy, half-an-hour later, Koyli talks of all she can buy with the money. Or could have bought for Santoshi. On September 28 night, her 11-year-old daughter died  Koyli says of starvation  seven months after the family stopped getting their rations as their Aadhaar wasnt linked to PDS. Later, the familys name was struck off the ration card list. Santoshi was the third child Koyli lost; the other two died of illness.Read | Santoshi died of starvationApart from the Rs 50,000 cheque and the Rs 15,000-odd in aid given by visiting leaders, Santoshis death has brought the family 75 kg of rice from the government and other benefactors, 20 kg of potatoes, two litres of edible oil, adequate kerosene oil, 10 soap bars, some green vegetables and tomatoes. Koyli is planning to stock up on more vegetables and pulses at the Wednesday haat.Then, once the cheque is encashed, Koyli will make other purchases. Family members are saying I should get a mobile phone. Also, we need things for the house. We will buy a box (suitcase), she says. The family, including Koyli, husband Tatya Naik, daughters Gudiya and Chando Kumari, and son Prakash, lives in a mud house, with mud-baked tiles for roof. The house comprises a large room, with a small area partitioned off as kitchen.The rest of the money she would keep in the bank, Koyli says, as saving  a new luxury for her.Earlier that day, Koyli indulged in another small luxury. When Chando, 8, asked for something to eat, she gave her Rs 10 to buy coconut biscuits. She likes fancy things to eat and was crying, Koyli says, with a faint smile.Santoshi was never fussy about food, the 45-year-old adds. She only kept asking for rice, but there was not a single grain at home.***************Rice for breakfast, rice for lunch, rice for dinner. Thats been Hemanti Kumaris routine all 10 years of her life. She is in Class 5 of Upgraded Primary School, Karimati. Santoshi cleared Class 5 from here too early this year, but never went on to the middle school (Classes 6 to 8), in the nearby Pangur hamlet.A sprightly girl, barely over 3 ft in height in her slippers and school uniform, Hemanti is happy as today has been a special day. In the morning, she made herself two chappatis and boiled some potatoes  that will be her evening snack, a rare fourth meal.Read | After starvation death case: Jharkhand minister scraps top state officials order on Aadhaar-PDS linkHer mother Padma Devi sits next to an earthen chulha, dug in the verandah of their mud house. She has placed twigs as cooking fuel, and from time to time, stirs a potato curry with tomatoes on the chulha.Hemantis father Gurucharan Mahato works as a labourer, taking up odd jobs. Padma cant do much work as both her legs are amputated. They live at her brother Nareshs home, and are grateful they have only two children to raise. Most families here have five to six children.Describing a regular day, Hemanti says she and her friends eat rice gruel in the morning, have rice with pulses and a seasonal vegetable for mid-day meal at school, and rice gruel again for dinner, sometimes supplemented with guda (a local shrub eaten raw). Only the mid-day meal sees variation, mostly in the form of papad and pickles on Saturdays, fruits three days a week, and eggs once a week.Shiv Nath Singh, a student of Class 3 in Hemantis school, has not gone to school. Mother Rukmani Devi remains silent when asked why. Putting plain rice before him for lunch, the 40-year-old says potatoes cost Rs 10 a kg. We cant get potatoes daily. We have pulses, but we only cook them sometimes.Ask what they consider a good meal, and she breaks into a laugh. Yahi sab na bhaat, daal, sabzi (Its all this only rice, pulses, vegetables). Once in a while, for a feast or a family function, villagers buy chicken or mutton.PDS doesnt provide more than 150-250 gm of rice per person per day on a ration card (see box). With their large sizes, families struggle to feed mouths. In the open market, rice of similar or lower grade costs at least Rs 22 a kg, while 2.5 litres of kerosene that they are also entitled to under PDS comes for Rs 75. Families cant afford these rates, and even buy their ration in bits and pieces as they never have enough money to buy in bulk.As per the October 2017 figures on the Jharkhand governments portal, 2,212 people in Karimati are under the PDS. Villagers claim almost every household has one members Aadhaar linked to their ration card.After Santoshis death, officials suspended the licence of the PDS dealer and Block Supply Officer for failing to ensure uninterrupted ration supply to her family, despite non-matching of Aadhaar. On October 21, Jharkhand Minister for Public Distribution System and Consumer Affairs Saryu Roy annulled an order by Chief Secretary Rajbala Verma to delete ration cards not linked with Aadhaar.***************I know families in Karimati who just scrape through, says Sudama Kachhap, a para-teacher heading the Upgraded Primary School. Santoshi used to be his student.Kachhap says Santoshis mother had promised to send her to middle school. But she didnt They are just so poor, he says.Even in this village of mainly daily wage labourers and farmers with small fields and poor yields, Kachhap adds, there was no family in as pitiable a state as Santoshis. Agar is gaon mein koi antim vyakti ya antim parivar hai, to yahi hai. Inse buri sthiti kisi ki nahin hai (If there is that last man or last family in this village, they are the one. Nobody is in as poor a condition as them), the 40-year-old says.(Express Photograph by Ratan Lal) (Express Photograph by Ratan Lal)As part of his duties, Kachchap also supervises the mid-day meal at the school.For the allocated Rs 4.13 per child per day, a mid-day meal is supposed to provide 450 gm of calories and 12 gm of proteins to children at the primary level. Children in middle school (Classes 6-8), are entitled to Rs 6.18 per day, for 700 calories and 20 gm proteins. Additionally, at Rs 4 per child per day, egg or seasonal fruit is given to the students on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.If the school remains closed for, say, four days, more than 90 per cent children would have eaten only rice those days, says Kachhap.The rations for the mid-day meal are sourced from the PDS block godown. The cost of the cook, appointed locally, comes out of the money allocated for children. Kachhap says the money is too less, going by the prices of eggs and vegetables that they have to buy from the open market, but they manage.There is another reason Kachchap is closely linked to Santoshis case. Till September last year, this para-teacher was also the Booth Level Officer (BLO) of Karimati, responsible for ensuring that villagers got themselves enrolled in Aadhaar, and got ration cards made. But, following an order that para-teachers should not be engaged in non-teaching works, his name was struck off.Read | Jharkhand starvation case: Girls family heckled out of village, now back homeHowever, since Kachchap knew the people, he continued to do the work. We have got complaints against him and are inquiring, says Jaldega Block Development Officer (BDO) Sanjay Kongari, referring to charges that Kachchap took money to get ration cards made. Kachchap denies the allegations.Hirawati Kumari, 17, claims he demanded Rs 1,600 from the family for a ration card. Her father Chhotu Ram died 18 months ago and her mother Keriyo Devi sustains the family working as a help in houses or through odd jobs in fields, earning around Rs 50 per day.Without a ration card, the family depends on the PDS Chhotu Rams elder brother gets. Giving a break-up of what it costs to buy from the market, Hirawati talks about last Wednesday when the family got 10 kg rice from the haat for Rs 22 per kg. Mother took an advance from a person she works for. She will now work four-five days without any reimbursement to pay back. She spent an additional Rs 30 to buy 3 kg of potatoes.Its a week later, and the family of four is left with only some rice, potatoes and guda. Hirawati says they have run out of sugar, tea and kerosene.She is lucky though, the 17-year-old amends. Thanks to her enrolment at Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya, 7 km away, where she studies in Class 8, she gets regular food. These schools were set up to ensure quality education for girls, predominantly from SC/ST, OBC and minority communities, in difficult areas, and admit children after a test. Hirawatis younger siblings, aged 10 and 4, depend on help from relatives.***************At Karimatis anganwadi centre, K D Chaudhary, the in-charge of the Jaldega Community Health Centre (CHC), is holding a health check-up camp. That is another thing Santoshis death has brought to Karimati. Chaudhary admits he does not remember the last time such a camp was held in the village, though a mobile medical van does the rounds every three-four months.Accompanying him is Dr Binod Oraon, the single man responsible for 174 primary schools and 132 anganwadi centres in Jaldega under the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram. It is an initiative under the National Health Mission for early intervention for children from birth to 18 years to cover 4 Ds  Defects at birth, Deficiencies, Diseases, and Development delays.Ask when he last visited Karimati, and Dr Oraon tells you to do the math. There are 365 days in a year. You add 174 and 132. Plus, there are several other issues to be looked into. How many times can I come in a year?Chaudhary is despondent about what he has seen so far at the health camp. Alcoholism is rampant. Their livers are weak, eyes are damaged, many have lost their senses. Jaundice, Hepatitis, TB There is severe lack of awareness, he reels off.As for malaria, the official cause of Santoshis death, Chaudhary says it is common, though not endemic. In fact, no malaria deaths have been reported from here in the last few years.***************Its easy to slip out of the net, like Santoshi and her family did. BDO Kongari claims it was technicalities that led to their name being taken off PDS list.Koylis husband Tatya, who also went by the name Tetwa, had a ration card. A few years ago, the government policy was changed when it was felt that ration cards should be in the name of women heads of the family, as they were more sincere. Ideally, in Koylis case, Tatyas name should have been replaced by Koylis. But, somehow, it got transferred to the name of Balmati Devi, Tatyas mother. The problem is that Balmati died 10 years ago, he says.In 2016, the Point-of-Sale (PoS) machine system was introduced, for biometric identification through Aadhaar of ration card holders. It required the Aadhaar number of at least one member of the family to be linked to their ration card. Both Koyli and Gudiya had Aadhaar since 2013. But nobody from the family got their Aadhaar linked to the ration card, as a result of which Balmatis name finally got deleted, says Kongari.Right to Food Campaign activist Tara Mani Sahu, who had raised the issue of Koylis ration card when Santoshi was alive, says, I tried to raise the matter at the district level, but nothing happened. We also get constant complaints about beneficiaries getting less than entitled ration. Dealers cut 1-2 kg, giving one or the other reason.There are also cases of members of families left out of ration cards. In the case of Lal Card holders (see box), the amount of ration a family gets will be less, points out Sahu.Kongari, however, maintains that the process of Aadhaar seeding with schemes has been smooth, and that nearly 100 per cent of the work is done in his block. New people will be added, but for all the programmes using direct benefit transfer (DBT, cash being transferred into accounts), Aadhaar seeding is almost complete, he says.But some villagers complain about MNREGA payments being irregular. Dupatti Devi worked under MNREGA a year ago and should have got over Rs 3,500. But she has got just Rs 800, she claims. Her husband Bideshi Baraik, she says, is a pagla  a euphemism for a chronic alcoholic in these parts. With four children to support, Dupatti is desperate. Only I know how I run my house, she says.District Supply Officer Nanki Ram admits there are problems. But we are trying to put in place a system where beneficiaries get payment without middlemen. Some names may have got left out. We are launching campaigns to get them enlisted, he says.PDS minister Saryu Roy says, What I mentioned in the order (annulling the order of the Chief Secretary), the same thing has now been said in a circular of the Government of India. It is very clear-cut (that non-linking of Aadhaar should not be used to deny benefits).Further, Roy says, he has asked the department to provide him month-wise and reason-wise break-up of the 11.3 lakh ration cards deleted after the PoS system was introduced. In the same period, the department has added nine lakh beneficiaries. I want to be sure that any deserving candidate has not got his name struck off, he says.***************Among the villagers, Santoshi or Koyli find no sympathy, with the people backing officials assertion that she died of malaria. Aaj ka jug mein koi bhookh se mare hao (Does anybody die of hunger in this day and age)? questions a woman.With Tatya unable to work, Koyli and Gudiya support the family through odd jobs at Lachragarh, or collect wood from the jungle and sell it at Rs 30-Rs 40 per bundle. The day-long task of picking up the twigs, bundling and selling them fetches only a little more. Labourer jobs, for around Rs 200 a day, are few and far between.None of the villagers was around to witness Santoshis slow descent to death, Gudiya recalls. Koyli had not been going to work. There was no rice for 15 days and, in the last eight days, the family went without a meal. Let alone rice, there was no salt, sugar, kerosene, not even a match-stick.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

That results in a per capita investment of $406.73 this year. Thats a drop in the bucket compared to the assets under management that are expected in the Robo Advisors category in India between 2017 and 2021, with a compound annual growth rate of 97.4%. Experts readily agree that the total value of assets under management with Robo Advisors in India will be worth approximately $100 million by 2021. Additionally, some 200,000 traders and investors are expected to be using Robo Advisors by that time. Compared to the USA, where Robo Advisors are adopted across the board, the total value of assets under management is some $182.505 billion.Why Are Robo Advisors So Popular in Canada, the US and Europe?Part of the problem with investing is understanding the investment terms, investment phraseology, investment landscape, and investment dynamics. These complicate the process of making investments in stocks, commodities, indices, currency pairs and the like. Financial services have evolved  thanks to innovative financial technology (FinTech)  to allow regular investors to dabble in the markets. People have long been seeking do-it-yourself-style investments, and one of the simplest ways to do this is a Robo Advisor.The technology is sufficiently advanced today to make it possible for individuals to successfully implement trading and investing activity via this high-tech platform. A Robo Advisor is not a robot; it is a financial advisor offering a full range of services to clients. They are not automatons  they simply exclude human beings from stock selection. The fact of the matter is that humans are not adept at choosing stocks for clients. If they were, we would all have a much higher success rate in the financial markets. Fortunately, Robo Advisors are managed and controlled by human beings, meaning that all customer service interactions will be conducted with real human beings.Robo Advisors Dramatically Cutting Costs in IndiaTraders across India get to enjoy the same Robo Advisor benefits from these services, like in Canada. Today, Robo Advisors are used for managing increasing components of personal financial portfolios. There are many benefits to using Robo Advisors in your day-to-day operations. For starters, these resources can provide up to 98% of the data, knowledge and information-based resources that are needed to begin trading and building a financial portfolio.There are many other benefits including Light Advice (information varies from one company to the next), improved investment options over mutual funds, an easy and effective way to invest your capital, easy to implement contribution methods, and the like. The websites that provide Robo Advisors are equally appealing to users, meaning that its click and pick functionality for the layman.Some financial writers have likened Robo Advisors to set and forget ways of investing. It should be stressed that Robo Advisors are not an impersonal way of taking money from you through robotic mediums of exchange. The FinTech Enterprises offering Robo advisor services are geared towards making it easier for anyone to invest money through smart technology. Its a DIY option for those who eschew big banks, financial corporations, and brokers in their ivory towers.You can conduct purchases of exchange traded funds, stocks, bonds, Forex, indices and commodities at your leisure. Most importantly, Robo Advisors are cutting costs and saving investors a tonne of money over the long-term. This is true in Canada, and it is a new reality in India today too. Within 4 years India will be a power player with this FinTech technology, and the trends are already showing strong signs of growth in this arena."
5a15126a9855b76bf13ea9b6,Let’s start at the very beginning,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2017/oct/24/lets-start-at-the-very-beginning-1682002.html,2017-10-24,,The New Indian Express,"CHENNAI: This week, we will cover about seed germination and transplanting.Seeds, where it all begins!There are various types of seeds  heirloom (naati), open pollinated (o/p), hybrid. However, heirloom or o/p seeds have the highest germination rate. A seed packet marked as F1 are hybrid varieties. A very common question asked by newbies is, the seed packets have Poison mentioned on the packets, is it safe to use them? They are completely safe to use for sowing purposes. The seeds are coated with a very thin layer of chemical so that the seeds do not rot or decay and have a longer shelf life.For plants such as methi, dill, etc seeds from the kitchen cupboard work but the germination rate is low, as they are processed for kitchen use. Most folks start off with buying seeds initially. Once they form a good network of gardening enthusiasts, they exchange seeds at meets and events. There are quite a number of green events held in Bangalore, which have stalls dedicated for selling seeds and saplings.GerminationOne can invest in a seeding/ germinating tray. A basic one costs about `50. Else you can also reuse/recycle egg shells, coconut shells, milk packet, juice cartons, curd cups etc. The most basic need for a seed to germinate is moisture. For making a germinating potting mix, you can take a few handfuls of cocopeat and compost, with some neem powder.The quantity of the ingredients need not be exact, since it will house the plant for just about 1-2 weeks. Germination time depends on various reasons like climate, source and health of the seeds. On an average seeds of bushy vegetable plants like tomato, brinjal, chilly take roughly 10 days. Methi seeds sprout in just 3-4 days.- Fill the germinating container with the above germinating potting mix.- Moisten the whole tray, by spraying water gently.- Make a small hole in the middle of each slot, with your finger/pencil, just a few millimeters deep.- Place the seed in the hole. Its a good idea to place 2-3 seeds so that at least one will germinate. Also there are sometimes lots of seeds in a single seed packet, which eventually one does not end up using. Use your own judgement !- Cover the holes with the potting mix around the slot, then give a very gentle press.- Place the tray in a bright but shaded place, away from direct sunlight.Sapling / TransplantingWhen you are transplanting from the seeding tray to the final container, make sure you are not doing it under direct sun. Do it around 6-7 am or 5-6 pm. Use extreme caution when taking out the sapling. Make sure that the stem along with the root structure and soil around the roots come out as a whole. Before taking the sapling out, you can gently press the outside of the seedling tray slot or container. You can use a spoon/fork to take out the sapling. Over a period of time, you will master this trick. TIP: If you plan to have, say, five tomato plants, then its a good idea to sow 10 seeds, just in case you loose some during the sowing, germinating or transplanting.In the final container make a hole in the middle, wide and deep enough to hold the sapling. If you have some cow dung, you can place it in the hole, before placing the sapling, so that the young plant gets some extra nutrition to sustain its initial days.Once transplanted, keep the container in a shady place. This will enable the sapling to bear the transplant shock. Water the container carefully, so as not to harm the sapling, as mentioned in the tips above. If at the initial stage (after transplanting), you feel that your plant needs support, you can stake the plant for support. Staking is placing a thin but strong piece of wood (similar to pencil). Insert it into the pot near the seedling, but not too close to the roots. Use a thread and tie the sapling loosely to the stick. This will give some support to the plant for the first few weeks of its life.Enjoy watching your plant grow from a seed over a few weeks and months!"

We caught up with the Delhi-based writer, painter and travel enthusiast ahead of the launch of her debut novel She and He in the city on November 25. Love and relationships define our very being, yet sometimes we forget its significance in our lives. We live very mechanical lives these days. My book is a reminder for this generation that love is everything, she smiles.A self-admitted hopelessly hopeful romantic, she says that the book focuses on the many facets of the man-woman relationship - both the simple and difficult. I have compared it with Yin-Yang and Siva-Sakti, where one is incomplete without the other. You cannot spark a dialogue on one aspect, without talking about the other. It is symbiotic, organic yet complex, she laughs.So what exactly prompted her to explore the dynamics of this puzzling bond? All that I have written is a reflection of my own experiences with relationships, and also those of my friends and family. I think personal anecdotes tend to make the narrative stronger and make people connect with the story better, she avers. I am an engineer with a mass communication degree, but writing has always been on my mind. From the 15-year-old about to touch the flames of love for the first time to a senior citizen, who has endured what life has thrown at him or her, I believe that everybody will be able to relate to the plot.Though this is the first time that Astha has penned a book on the subject, it is not the first time that she has tried to creatively express the dimensions of the man-woman relationship. As I am an artist as well, I had already come up with an exhibition of paintings based on the same theme in 2015. I also plan to do a She and He cookbook, featuring simple recipes with flavours that marry well. For example garlic bread and tomato soup, and even a short story series soon, she grins.Word of adviceAfter being turned down by publications, Astha decided to just go for it and self-publish her book. She recommends the same to aspiring writers.She & He is available on Amazon and is priced at `500"

My motive behind gardening is to give my family and neighbours chemical-free food, says 53-year-old Poonam Bhide, who lives at Viman Nagar in Secunderabad.Started gardening in 1979, she says that we should let Nature the way it is and not tamper with it. She had never thought of gardening until she came across Facebook groups promoting organic gardening. Out of curiosity she joined the groups and went on to discover the beauty and benefits of gardening. Inspired by gardeners across the country, from just a flower garden she has now developed an organic garden. This garden is spread out in an area of approximately 175 yards. Currently, she is growing vegetables like brinjal, cucumber, snake gourd, tomatoes, chilly, drumstick, and potatoes. She says, I have not bought vegetables from the market for the past two years. The produce from the garden is self-sufficient and I also give the extra to my neighbours. Fruits include guava, papaya, pomegranate and coconut. From her produce, she makes jams, chutneys and healthy drinks.Adding to the list, she also specialises in terrace gardening. She does not use any kind of container for the plants. Layers of fertile soil are developed directly on the slab. The making of soil layer is a four-month-long process. Slab beds with dimensions 12 by 3 feet using a mix of leaf litter and soil. She also grows 26 varieties of leafy vegetables. She not only specialises in growing indigenous plants but also exotic plants. Exotic plants include passion fruit creeper and vengeri brinjal. She takes extra care of the exotic plants and has successfully grown 10-feet tall plant of vengeri brinjal variety. Apart from this, medicinal plants are abundantly found in her garden. In a city where there is water scarcity, she is trying to promote the idea that throughout the year, soil needs to be covered with mulch. This helps prevent evaporation of water. Outdoor burning of waste and leaf litter is not advisable. So composting and mulching comes to the rescue.Composting is a microbial process that converts plant materials such as grass clippings and leaves to a more usable organic soil amendment or mulch. Gardeners have used compost for centuries to increase soil organic matter, improve soil physical properties, and supply some of the essential nutrients for plant growth. Mulching refers to the practice of applying a layer of materials such as compost, leaves, or grass clippings to the soil surface in order to modify soil temperature and moisture as well as control weeds and soil erosion, she explains. She traps rainwater in and around her residence to water her plants. Gate valves are switched to direct water from washing machine and bathrooms into garden pipes which are directed into soil and specific plants. Kitchen waste water is also stored to water plants during summer.Poonam is a theatre and Hindustani music enthusiast. Gardening gives me peace of mind. I love to be in tune with nature."

My whole family felt safe there. We were content with nature, with the birds and the squirrels, and we all ate idlis together in my garden, recalls Lakshmi Venkatasubramaniyan, with tears in her eyes. CE spoke to her about her 1,200sqft garden and the techniques she follows to maintain it. The 45-year- old has been terrace gardening since 2002, starting with flowering plants.Lakshmi Venkatasubramaniyanin her gardenHer garden, with 5ft trimmed trees such as red guava, chikku, star fruit, custard apple, varieties of drumstick, tamarind, herbs such as stevia (good for diabetics), Thai and Italian basil, krishnar tulsi, flowering plants such as jasmine including ramabanam and ramar malli, adeniums (dessert rose), thazhampoo, vegetables such as multivitamin spinach- all vitamins, bay leaf constituting to more than 300 plants, shows her passion for plants.Those days, my father grew ladys finger and tomato and my mother plucked flowers from our own plants. It was a part of our life. Thats how I started, she says. However, she was new to terrace gardening when she began. The BSc Math graduate gained knowledge from Namaalwar books, videos, facebook pages and a lot of other books on gardening techniques. I struggled to change from traditional pot mixes, which contained, red soil, river soil and cow dung, to the modern method of adding coco pete to the soil, she says. Coco pete or coir pith is a spongy medium that when mixed with soil, can retain water in it and makes the pot mix loose and lightweight for terrace gardening.One blunder she talks about is blindly following books that instruct people to 'pluck leaves that are infected'. Each day, I plucked one leaf of peerkanga and one day only the stem remained, she laughs.When space hinders gardening, she suggests beginners to do plant companion planting where a tree, herb and creeper can be grown together. Grow kaaramani, fenugreek and thatta payiru as companion plants with other plants, as they are nitrogen fixating plants. Vertical garden can be opted for if there is no space. Customised pots are available to be fixed on the wall, she says.If spending for plants hinders gardening, dont worry, she has solutions for that too. Replace jute bags, milk packets, aata bags, watermelon skin, egg shell or orange skin if grow bags are not affordable.I have remodeled a tire in to a container for spinach and it works out well, she shares.The right time to sow seeds is aadi maasam, she says. October- January winter vegetables such as carrot, coriander, broccoli, exotic veggies, stevia and strawberry can be grown.While all want to get rid of pests, she says that good pests follow bad pests. So we cant completely eradicate pests, but can distract them with 3G, perungayum, buttermilk, panjakavya, jeevamrithum which is made by processing cow dung, cow urine, handful of garden soil, besan flour for three days. On the fourth day, dilute it with water in 1:10 ratio to enrich the microbes in the soil.Plants in turn take nutrition from them. Strong smell of herbs such as mint, neem leaves, karpuravalli and tulsi can also distract bad pests by covering the smell of other plants.I buy red sand, seeds, cow dung and bone meal which is rich in phosphorus from the Cathedral road nursery, she says, as she believes the place is reliable. She has been awarded the 'Outstanding Gardener' award 2015 at Chennai gardens meet, organic garden foundation, and first prize in best terrace garden competition held by VGP trust in September, 2016."

And for the health conscious among us, what if the thokku was made out of bittergourd or capsicum? Will you still say yes to it? Meet Rajalakshmi Allen, who began Jhos Kitchen in January this year out of her sheer passion for food and cooking. I was pursuing my PhD part-time and had to discontinue due to health issues. So while I was at home, I thought of doing something and at the same time take care of my daughter too. So I entered this field, she explains.Rajalakshmi Allen with her motherThe venture which is named after her two-and-a-half year old daughter Joshita, she says is run by her family. I havent employed anybody from outside. It is solely run by me and my family. Every member in the family helps out and this is the result of their support, she smiles.From podis, appalam and thokku to different varieties of ready rice mix, Jhos kitchen caters to most South Indian vegetarian dishes. Their speciality however is their variety of thokku  onion, green chilli, capsicum, ginger, bittergourd, tomato, garlic, etc. I do cook continental and north Indian food as well. But, for the time being I am only selling my South Indian varieties. I try and experiment with as many vegetables as possible to make my thokku. These are the ones you wont get anywhere in the market. People often assume that bittergourd thokku will be extremely bitter and dont prefer it, but it doesnt have a bitter taste  it is a mix of flavours she points out.What quantity is the thokku sold at? I sell a minimum of 100 grams. The prices usually vary with the availability of the vegetable in the market, like the pudhina podi  when the prices in the market go down; I buy it and make the podi. I always prepare it fresh and dont store it for longer period. So is the case with the pickles too  lime, mangoes, gooseberry  it all depends on the season, she adds.Apart from the regular sambar and rasam mix, Rajalakshmi also makes the Kandanthippili rasam podi, which has many medicinal values. It is very good for curing ailments like cold, cough and fever.Although Rajalakshmi hasnt done any marketing for her venture yet, she says that the responses have been good so far. When people taste it, they come back for more. Mostly people learn about Jhos Kitchen through word of mouth. The stall at Kadaiveedhi was my first till now and I have learnt so much through this.What was the best compliment you got so far? The best compliment was that my capsicum thokku is awesome. It started with vengaya thokku, when people said that it was awesome, then it shifted to other vegetables, she says. With a set of compliments from those who buy and constant support an motivation from her family, Rajalakshmi seems all pumped up to take her venture further and even plans to introduce more varieties of thokku.For details, call: 9445614242"

For the past three decades, she has been helping foreign tourists acquaint themselves with traditional cuisines of India.And the meals prepared and served at her house in a true Indian manner always leave foreigners satisfied and with everlasting memories. Hema welcomes foreigners with a garland and tilak. Before they depart, she gives them tamboola as a gift. She uses only plantain leaves to serve the meals. She takes every possible care to ensure that foreigners enjoy fresh food and warm hospitality.Hema also teaches foreigners how to eat food without using spoons and chopsticks. She describes in detail various kinds of ingredients used for preparing the meals and their health benefits. A detailed menu card helps foreigners get familiar with the name of traditional South Indian delicacies. Often, she is seen taking the foreigners to markets to introduce them to local vegetables and spices. The right amount of spices is necessary for a healthy food, she always tells her guests.In our country, we do not use so much of spices and flavours. The South Indian food we had here was very delicious and exotic. The flavours blended so well and the taste was just incredible. Mango chitranna, brinjal gojju, tomato bath prepared using dry fruits and rotis were very good. We would love to visit this place again, says Jessica from the US.Carina Maria from Germany adds: I savoured the food with ghee and the colourful palyas. I learnt some of the recipes from Hema and just cannot wait to try them when I am back home.Hema also runs a cooking school Indias Royal Kitchen at her residence in Vontikoppal, where several foreigners have learnt the tricks of the culinary trade. Not just your tongue, but the food should also be able to satiate the eyes and the nose. The aroma and the look of the food trigger the senses in the body, making one feel like trying it. If grinded together, the spices blend well, and the right flavour of the spices leaves one craving for more, explains the 50-year-old avid cook.Over her tryst with cooking, Hema says, I started cooking at the age of eight. Pancakes and South Indian filtered coffee were the two things that I learnt to prepare first. Fascinated by the grinding stone, I soon started spending more time in the kitchen. As a child, I got to eat the best homemade food rich in spices. My grandmother and mother were both passionate about cooking.Her favourite dish: Majjige Huliconsecutive days. When asked to share the recipe for the same, she said: First cut the ash gourd to small cubes and put them to boil in a vessel. Then grind green chillies, cumin, coconut, coriander leaves, chana dal and moong dal. Once the ash gourd is soft, add the masala and boil. Later, add curd and cook for one boil. Oil, mustard and curry leaves could be used for seasoning. The delicious curry will be ready.Indian food in foreign kitchensHema Malini Devi has held several cooking workshops across the globe. I was once invited by Berea University to give presentation on the spices and conduct cooking workshops. I taught them the significance of spices and South Indian delicacies. Everyone enjoyed the sessions and since then, I have cooked Indian food umpteen times in foreign kitchens, says Hema. I have travelled to San Francisco, Taos in New Mexico, Houston, London and several European countries to conduct cooking workshops.

Farmers in state have already suffered successive droughts since 2015, and more rains could result in huge losses for them. Experts feel there will be a surge in post-harvest diseases if such moist conditions persist throughout October. Dr N Nagaraj, Professor of Plant Pathology, University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS) told Express that if it rains heavily during October, farmers tend to harvest their crops early.Due to such showers, it becomes a problem for farmers to dry and store the produce. As a result, post-harvest diseases such as formation of moulds will increase and hurt revenues of the farmer, he said. Quoting the example of an experimental plot of UAS, he said that the plot of land that used to give 200 kg of harvest might provide a maximum harvest of 140 kg of vegetables this year. Perishable crops like tomato are affected by diseases such as Phytophthora Late Blight. Other crops such as papaya, chillies and vegetables will be affected due to spell of rains, he said.Crops such as moong bean, maize, jowar and ragi too are not exempt from the consequences of such weather. Paddy is among the few crops that will not be affected much, he said. However, rains effect ragi, when earheads are growing in the plants. If water stands in the ragi form, the earheads will sprout, leading to loss for farmers, he said. Shivkumar Naiklal, scientist at Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Cell said that overcast conditions also effect crops which are about to flower. He said that 99% of the State had adequate moisture in soil, after two years of moisture stress due to drought."

Started by Bikash Parikh, who worked in the sports sector earlier but had a dream of starting his own place, the concept of the restaurants is driven on him wanting to break the myth that healthy, vegetarian food isn't tasty.The menu is limited, and the food is all made fresh. We don't store anything, the food is all made fresh. And because of that, if your meal takes about ten minutes more to get ready, says Parikh.We started the meal with a carrot and ginger juice and a peanut butter smoothie topped with granola. Both were delicious and just right on the sweetness factor. The Mezze Platter looked healthy, sounded healthy and was high on taste, with homemade multigrain breads, beetroot humus, chia seed humus and tahini. Next was the Raw Papaya and Soba Noodle with Som Tum dressing salad  one of the best raw papaya salads we have tried of late, with just the right amount of Asian flavours and spice. We also tried the Vietnamese Pho with Soba Noodles, the flavours hit the spot that chilly evening. Global cuisine at pure vegetarian eateries wasn't common in the city. This is something I wanted to change, and that's why you find Asian, Italian, Mexican cuisine on the menu, says Parikh.For the mains, we tried the Whole Wheat Spaghetti with Tomato Ragout and the Cottage Cheese steak with Mexican Rice. The spaghetti had a very home cooked feel to it, as did most of the food, and was loaded with vegetables. Though not a fan of cottage cheese, the steak was grilled and topped with a sauce that complemented it perfectly, and when paired with the rice and grilled vegetables, the overall experience was a satisfying one.If you want something sweet (and healthy) after your meal, ask for the special of the day. Although they didn't have any of the specials that day, as the desserts are all made with fresh ingredients, we did sample some sweet treats from the in-house bakery called The Bakehouse. We tried an oreo chesecake and a salted caramel tart, both of which tasted like they came out from your mother's oven, simple, flavoursome and comforting.The decor is also eco-friendly. The limestone and mud walls, along with the rustic artifacts and restored teak wood floors, resonate Prikh's belief of keeping things local, and that you don't have to spend exorbitant amounts to make a space look good.If you're in the mood to eat simple and healthy, then Little Green Cafe is just for you.

(Source: AP) Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses the gathering during dedication of a new Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) campus at Gandhinagar. (Source: AP)We have been great admirers of Gujarats agrarian miracle when Narendra Modi was the states chief minister from October 7, 2001 to May 22, 2014. Gujarats agri-GDP registered an unprecedented growth of 8 per cent per annum during 2002-03 to 2013-14, way more than the all-India figure of 3.3 per cent per annum (Graph 1). Gujarats agri-growth was even higher than that achieved by Punjab during the Green Revolutions heydays (5.7 per cent per annum during 1971-85). This gave Modi a big political dividend and he was returned to the CMs office thrice. It was good economics and good politics.So, when Modi became the prime minister in May 2014, one was expecting that the Gujarat model would be extended to many states  of course with the fine-tuning to suit each states requirements. But the growth of all-India agri-GDP in the first three years of NDA rule has come down to 1.8 per cent. This is less than half of what was achieved during the last three years of the UPAs rule (Graph 2). Deficient rain in 2014-15 and 2015-16 is of course one factor behind this poor performance. But there were bumper harvests in 2016-17, yet farmers suffered due to a collapse in agri-prices. The advance estimates of 2017-18 do not indicate much recovery, and the agri-growth in the first four years under the Modi government may turn out to be around 2 per cent per annum.Here we focus on how to get Indian agriculture on a path where it can have a growth rate of least 4 per cent  although it has the potential to grow at 5 per cent or even a little more; the productivity levels of Indian agriculture are very low by international standards. The promise of doubling farmers income by 2022 cannot be fulfilled if agri-growth remains subdued at 2 per cent per annum. So, what can the prime minister do at this juncture? Should he set up another expert committee or just look back at the agrarian miracle achieved under his leadership in Gujarat, learn some important lessons, and fine tune them at the all-India level?In order to answer these questions, one needs better diagnosis of Gujarats excellent agri-performance when Modi was the states chief minister. Our research at ICRIER shows that the states agri-growth was driven by four factors. First, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee governments bold decision to allow the commercial use of Bt cotton became a catalyst for change, from which Gujarat benefited the most. From nowhere in 2002, Bt cotton spread to more than 90 per cent of the area under cotton in Gujarat by 2014. Production at the all-India level increased from 14 million bales in 2002-03 to 39.8 million bales by 2013-14, as per the Cotton Corporation of India. Indias raw cotton export increased from a meagre $10 million to $4,258 million by 2011-12, making the country the worlds second largest cotton producer and exporter (Graph 3). A forthcoming study, of which Ashok Gulati is a co-author, shows that the cumulative gain from import saving, extra raw cotton export and extra yarn export  compared to the business-as-usual scenario  between 2003-04 and 2016-17 is estimated to be $67.4 billion at the all-India level. Cotton from Gujarat had a big share in these exports. If cotton export had been banned, this revolution would not have fructified. Access to the best markets is, therefore, as important as access to the best seeds.Second, it may be worth recalling that the Bt cotton seeds came from a global seed company  Monsanto  in association with an Indian partner Mahyco, and then multiplied by several licensees. In this context, it is interesting to see that while China is taking over Syngenta for $43 billion to access the best technologies for its farmers, the Centre is creating conditions that may force companies like Monsanto to quit. This government is literally reversing the benefits that the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government bestowed to farmers.The third key lesson from the Gujarat story relates to providing basic infrastructure to farmers  irrigation, power and roads enabled the easy adoption of Bt cotton, and benefited other crops and the livestock sector as well. Check dams, bori bandh and khet talavadi provided life-saving irrigation, while the Jyotigram Yojana helped improve rural electrification. Another crucial infrastructure for agri-growth is all-weather roads. Currently, Gujarat has one of the best road-network in the country, with 930 km of roads per 1,000 sq km, of which 89 per cent are pucca/surfaced roads.Fourth, good marketing institutions propelled Gujarat agriculture, especially its dairy industry. The AMUL model of directly buying milk from farmers cooperatives and processing and distributing it through millions of outlets ensures that farmers receive 75-80 per cent of the consumers price. This model is worth extending to other commodities, especially fruits and vegetables, bypassing the mandi system. It is time to launch Operation Veggies TOP (Tomatoes, Onions and Potatoes) on the lines of Operation Flood.What are the key lessons, then, from CM Modi to PM Modi? First, enable farmers to access best technologies and best markets at home or abroad; second, invest in basic infrastructure that can give access to water for irrigation, power and rural roads; and third, create AMUL type institutions for other commodities to enable farmers to access high share of consumers price. Export bans or high minimum export prices for agri-products are anti-farmer. The government should use satellites and drones to identify places appropriate for building check dams across the country and use the MGNREGA workforce to build such dams. It should ensure farmers get power either through the grid or solar panels, and supplement this with micro-irrigation (drips and sprinklers) to get more crop, per drop.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Similarly, the price of chilli has doubled from Rs 40 to Rs 80 per kg in the retail market. Coriander, that must ingredient, is out of reach: it has jumped from Rs 25 to Rs 50 per bunch in the retail market. And this trend is likely to continue for another 15 days.Vegetable prices have soared in Mysuru, Hubballi and Mangaluru too. Market experts say that the unusual pattern of rainfall is to be blamed for the price rise. Vendors said that since the crops have been destroyed in rain-abundant districts, prices have skyrocketed. G R Srinivas, former president, HOPCOMS, said, Wherever rainfall has been more, crops have been damaged. It will take another month or two for the next crop to be successfully harvested. Till then the prices will see an inflation.Russell Market Traders Association General Secretary Idrees Chaudhury said, Farmers say the situation wont improve for another 15 days. Customers who purchased one kilo of produce are buying quarter kilo. Sales have dropped.A vendor in Shivajinagar, Mohammed Shahnawaz, said, It is not just rain that played spoilsport. Due to the festival, farmers arent working in the field. So, we have no option but to hike prices.Nagabhushana K S, a resident of Kengeri who shopped in KR Market on Thursday, said, Local variety of beans costs Rs 80 per kg, while brinjal costs Rs 60, the prices of both vegetables are steep.

Well, what else would you expect from a curry place, you ask? Well, at Coyla Cababs and Curries, Whitefield, I was pleasantly surprised, having found myself indulging in a heartwarming and the most comforting loaf of an aristocratic naan that pledges its allegiance to a royal pedigree. I got a taste of Taftan, a leavened flour bread that traces back to Persia.Coyla , Four Points by Sheraton offers Makhanwala Ghar Ka Paneer, Amritsari Pindi Chole, Sarson Ka Saag, Succulent Nalli Nihari and the traditional Kukkad Makhanwala among other desi preparations.The Paneer Tikka Angare has the fluffy cottage cheese grilled in a tandoor, leaving you with a taste of roasted spices and a moist paneer. The Jhinga Dum Nisha has the prawn coated in spices. The Gosht Chapli Cabab on their menu comes highly recommended. The meat is minced well, blended with spices employed with thorough cooking.The Makhanwala Ghar Ka Paneer has a smooth buttery tomato gravy that isnt too heavy on the spices, neither is it as oily as conventional paneer sabjis are. The Baingan Bharta too is less oily than what I am used to at home, but I guess the kitchen is adapting to the healthier lifestyle of its guests. The Kukkad Makhanwala is the traditional buttery chicken curry; the meat is well cooked and tastes of a richer version of the conventional Indian masala curry based in tomato puree.I would also like to give a shout out to the Methi Cherra Aloo on the menu. The dish is simplicity personified as deliciousnes. The chef has let the methi and aloo bring its own flavour to the dish, by keeping the spices on check. What a beauty, this was! I would highly recommend you to try this sabji if you visit Coyla. The Dal Makhani is rich and creamy.But if I havent made it more obvious yet, it was indeed the Taftan that stole my heart at this restaurant. It was light, flaky, bubbled well on the corners, soft and just served as the perfect soul food for a rainy evening. The Gulab Jamun was warm, soft and not overtly sweet, topped with pista flakes.So, if you are looking for some soothing comfort food to keep you warm on a rainy evening, head over to Coyla and order yourself some Taftan and Methi Cherra Aloo, Id say.Cost for two: Rs 1,700 (approx)"

(Source: PTI) Narendra Modi wields a broom with NDMC workers to launch Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. (Source: PTI)The neurologist, Antonio Damasio, once wrote, A brain that cant feel, cant make up its mind. Examples abound where ostensibly rationally thinking human beings with perfect information and foresight choose collectively to defy the fundamental tenet of classical economics. They tend to succumb when the dessert cart trundles by, to the great consternation of economic theorists and clairvoyants. We all break our diets.My own experience with policy and its delivery allows me to cite a few more such scenarios where pure economic policy-making crumbled at the event horizon  the policy was of little use to communities it was designed to help. As an implementer, I found programmes requiring normative behavioural change distressingly difficult to deliver, and admittedly, success was moderate.Lets take the case of Swachh Bharat, a proverbial horse and water scenario. Building toilets and creating infrastructure has not proved to be enough to make people use them. Naming and shaming has met with limited success to change preferences here. In the absence of social disincentives with everyone indulging in the same behaviour, and the practice being a collective habit perfected over the years, something more than building toilets (mostly without water supply) needs to be done here.Another of many such examples is the win-win-win incentive whorl created by our agricultural policy owing to the MSP guarantee to a limited number of crops, mainly rice and wheat. Its a winning scenario for farmers growing crops underwritten by the MSP. Fertiliser subsidies encourage more use and productivity in the short term  a win-win for both farmers and suppliers. Government procurement further fortifies overflowing FCI godowns, adding to our confidence of being sufficient in grain, adding the third win. In this system of self perpetuating incentivisation, where is the scope to wean away farmers from cereal crops towards cash crops and ensure a better agro-climatic fit?So what is that new perspective? Lets understand through a few examples again. Singapore is so spick and span, they say, you could eat out off the road. Locals file at the Tokyo metro entry and exit in perfect straight lines like automatons without a prompt, every single day of their commute. In fact, Japan is so low on public misdemeanour, more force and resources are deployed for the community service bureau than the crime bureau in the National Police Force. People behaving well save these governments billions in enforcement costs. In another example of a government harnessing normative insight, the British government called in game theorists to help design auctions for 3-G mobile telecoms operating licences in 2000, and ended up raising a cool $35.4 billion, exploiting the competitive gaming behaviour of the bidders. In short, understanding strategy requires a perspicacious look into social norms and habits, and into human behaviour guiding such norms and habits. Policy needs to be informed thus.Guided by such principles, the British government now has a full-fledged Behavioural Insights Team (BIT) also called the Nudge Unit working with the Cabinet Office. The two mantras informing all policy are: If you want to encourage someone to do something, make it easy (here is a case for simplifying tax returns), and we cant do evidence-based policy without evidence (perhaps a case for more decentralised planning tailored to local needs). Their five-year old What Works Network to encourage the government to test new ideas is already available in some manner in an indigenous avatar of the PMOs website welcoming crowdsourcing of ideas for better insights and policy design. Another stellar example to emulate is the public connect network established by the Gujarat government through BISAG (the Bhaskaracharya Institute of Space-Applications and Geo-informatics), the brainchild of our prime minister. The institute has done great work in sustainable development and inclusive growth through communication, information and direct public connect.The US too has an SBST Team (Social and Behavioural Sciences Team) in the White House, which conducts randomised controlled trials to test the effectiveness of federal policy. It has helped veterans make choices for better pension plans. It has also helped people to pay off their educational loans and also helped the IRS to increase tax compliance using simple nudges instead of hard (dis) incentives.Policy design in India thus stands to gain by being behaviourally-informed especially in the realm of policy outcomes like clean India. Working in a normative space with communities, instead of an antiseptic economic sphere, shall ensure the achievement of desired policy outcomes in the long run while minimising costs to the exchequer. This calls for the inclusion of their choices and preferences in policy and using nudges, that is continuous subtle suggestions and subliminal prompts, so that behaviours that are beneficial are reinforced and those which are damaging are extinguished.Remember, in the long run, we are all humans.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Flax seeds has been consumed as food for around 6,000 years. It could very well be the worlds first cultivated super food. Their benefits help you improve digestion, rejuvenate the skin, lower cholesterol, reduce sugar cravings, balance hormones, fight cancer and most definitely promote weight loss. Often called linseeds, they are the richest source of plant based omega-3 fatty acids, called alpha linolenic acid.There are many ways to add this super seed into ones diet.

5a152e689855b76bf13ebf1d,Denmark Super Series: Attacking Kidambi Srikanth stuns Viktor Axelsen in three games,http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/badminton/denmark-super-series-attacking-srikanth-stuns-world-no-1-axelsen-in-three-games-4899468/,2017-10-21,,Indian Express,"K Srikanth beat Viktor Axelsen 14-21, 22-20, 21-7. (Source: Reuters) K Srikanth beat Viktor Axelsen 14-21, 22-20, 21-7. (Source: Reuters)Viktor Axelsen is 63. Its an imposing 63 that maxed its advantages two months ago in beating the best of China  Chen Long and Lin Dan, as the tall Dane won the World Championships. Its also where Indian coach Pullela Gopichand watched a tad heartbreakingly as PV Sindhu  a near 6 footer  was brought down literally by Nozomi Okuhara  5 feet and a little more. The enduring image of that womens singles final was the ribbon like long slashing frame of Sindhu bent low, in clearly what is an awkward retrieving stance for the tall Indian.On Friday, it was an Indian slightly shorter than the towering Axelsen, who magnified the perils of being tall in pursuit of a dipping shuttle.Kidambi Srikanth caused mental mayhem for World Champion Viktor Axelsen in beating the Dane 14-21, 22-20, 21-7 on Friday to make the semifinals of Denmark Open. Winner of two Super Series titles this season, Srikanth had gone off the boil at the World Championships where Axelsen picked his maiden crown. But Srikanth pounced on the net often and was assured in his attacking play at Axelsenss home event, to record a major upset in front of the partisan crowd.It was Srikanths ability to cut off all that altitude on his strokes and keep the shuttle flat and low, that literally brought down the high flying Dane who has been in the form of his life these past few months. Like a kite runner, slashing off and bringing down rival kites, Srikanth killed the flight on the shuttle successfully to deny the world champ Axelsen a home semifinal.Srikanth is both intuitive in badminton and boasts of shots that can make use of his fast-processing shuttle smarts, to implement plans that his coaches sketch out. Against the long and looming Axelsen, the plan was to take the vertical advantage out of the equation.Theres nothing tall players hate more than bending low. Gopichand knows this particularly well because its the biggest challenge he faces when putting together Sindhus game. Tall players have a natural high centre of gravity that wrecks havoc with both balance and low defense. This low defense can turn nightmarish as was exploited by the 24 year old Indian against his opponent, a year younger and many inches taller.Srikanth would stub the height in the shuttle, displaying immense control in limiting the field of play to very close to (and just above) the net.So his famed attack was channelled towards keeping the shuttle as low as possible, denying Axelsen any freedom to start wheeling his long arms. Tosses and lifts were kept to a bare minimum to nip every attempt of an Axelsen smash. And as the game progressed Srikanths feet moved fast, picking the shuttle early and ensuring that it stayed low piling the discomfort of retrieving by bending and lunging on the Dane.High shots went near missing by the time Srikanth shrugged off the first set deficit and a 21-7 scoreline in the decider pointed to how effectively Srikanth had cramped Axelsen for height on a near perfect day.The 24-year-old Indian unleashed a flurry of down the line smashes deep on Axelsens forehand in overturning the first set deficit. The offense was potent in both pace and precision, but Srikanth gained confidence for what was a whiplash of a decider after some gritty retrieving of his own in the second set.It was while trailing in the opener that Srikanth had made his intent clear with some angular cross court flicks at the net. They didnt yield him immediate points as he struggled with the drift, but he was chipping away at the home contenders confident striding with some devilish deception of the wrist.Viktor  a defensive automaton helped by his massive reach, was wrong footed twice and even got himself into a tangle and landed awkwardly midway through the mid set. Srikanth, seeded 8th, would then stay in the match keeping the margins narrow snapping at the heels of the 23-year-old second seed.Coach Gopichand till then sitting for the HS Prannoy match would hop into the coachs seat soon after the opener, and guide Srikanth through what was a mental battle. Srikanth would first come up trumps in the battle of the net with his tight dribbles and then push the attack to the rear putting Viktors forehand defense to deep scrutiny. Playing the lines and upping the pace, Srikanth would expose a vulnerability and then twist the knife deeper widening the lead in the third.Axelsen fell apart under the sustained pressure and exited his home tournament, collapsing in a pile of errors. Srikanth looks good to make the Denmark finals and resume his Super Series title conquests this year. Slow to start he might ve been, but this wasnt down to him being inconsistent. Once he got a measure of the tosses and lifts in the windy stadium, and killed off both, Srikanth was right on top of the best retriever currently in world badminton.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

Narendra Vaskar Sanjay Nimbalkar and his daughter, Pranjal. Narendra VaskarSANJAY NIMBALKAR (57), a general physician for 34 years, claimed that his skills and experience were tested the most during the nine-hour travel in the Karmali-Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) Tejas Express on Sunday. His biggest challenge was to calm down passengers on board the train, in which 24 passengers had to be admitted to the Life Care hospital in Chiplun after they complained of food poisoning.Nimbalkar, who was travelling in the chair car compartment on Sunday, along with his wife and daughter, recalled the journey when two of the co-passengers complained of nausea and stomach pain. We had just finished with our tomato soup at 12.30 pm when someone came calling out to check if there was any doctor in the train. When my daughter and I told them that we were medical practitioners, we were told about two passengers who complained of stomach pain and nausea. By the time we attended to them, the situation had become intense, said Nimbalkar, who runs his clinic in CBD Belapur in Navi Mumbai.The doctor recalled that when they began attending to the ill passengers, other passengers were already in a state of confusion and panic. While many suggested to halt the train at that given spot, a few even reached to pull the chain in the train, he said. We had just left Ratnagiri railway station when the incident happened. The next halt was at Chiplun railway station, at least two hours away. After giving the required medication to a few passengers who complained of nausea, we realised nothing was going to work on them till they get the required medical care in a hospital. So, we tried our best to convince the passengers that the train needs to run till we reach a specific halt, added Nimbalkar.The father-daughter doctor duo added that they did not have their stethoscopes or other accessories with them as they were returning from a four-day holiday in Goa. By checking the pulse of ill passengers and through analysing their symptoms, Nimbalkar said, they tried to identify the problem and spread a word of caution to others. We saw the relatives of passengers were surrounding those who were ill, suffocating them further. This was followed by switching off the air-conditioner in the coach as many complained of the vomit smell that had spread across coaches. We asked them not to surround the ill passengers and allow them to breath freely, said Nimbalkar. While a few of those taken to the hospital blamed the food served in the train, which they claimed was smelly, the Nimbalkars claimed they were satisfied with the quality of food that was served to them.After the train halted at Chiplun station for two hours, we resumed the journey at 2.30 pm. I had my lunch at around 4.30 pm without having any issue with the quality of food served. Many other passengers too had their lunch, said Nimbalkar. I am not a judge to say whether there was any problem in the food. However, with a less than two minute halt at each station in this train which has automatic doors, passengers can not take a chance to step out at stations and eat. Few of them opt to carry lunch with them. Many will thus opt to eat in the train, hoping the food served is suitable to the price we pay, he added.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Forty of the 294 passengers, travelling to the city from Karmali in Goa on Sunday, were rushed to the Life Care hospital in Chiplun after the train was stopped there. Twenty-four of them had to be admitted to the hospital. But on Monday morning, all of them were discharged and transport arranged to send them to Mumbai, said railway officials.According to senior railway officials, the committee spoke to passengers, the AC mechanic, the train conductor and ticket examiners to find out the reason for the passengers throwing up as the initial suspicion was on the food served on the train. Food on Tejas not reason for passengers taking ill: RailwaysIt emerged that two groups of tourists were travelling in the affected coach, one from Himachal Pradesh and the other from Kolkata. Two children travelling with the group from Himachal Pradesh first vomited in the coach. The smell and sight caused uneasiness among the other passengers and then two more children threw up. Then two more children vomited, triggering a vomiting spree in the compartment, railway officials said.The IRCTC has served a showcause notice to catering contractor J K Ghosh. The area officer of the IRCTC at Madgaon and the onboard manager too were placed under suspension. The inquiry on them is still under way. The caterer has been supplying food in the premium train for three months.A committee comprising the senior divisional commercial manager of the CR, additional chief medical superintendent, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and additional general manager, IRCTC (Western zone), was formed to inquire into the episode. Feedback about the quality of food was taken from passengers, almost all of whom said the food served was satisfactory. Food samples were found to be within their expiry dates, said a statement from the railways.Of the 294 passengers onboard the Tejas Express, 230 were served breakfast consisting of omelette, cutlet, tea, coffee and juice at 9.30 am followed by tomato soup at 12.30 pm. Passengers reported not feeling well from 12.30 pm onwards.The railways statement quotes the tour manager of the group from Kolkata, Kajal Chakravarti, who said there was no problem with the food quality. As many as six passengers of the 16 from the group from Himachal Pradesh and six others from the group of 23 travelling from Kolkata fell ill on the train. Food poisoning could have been caused by food eaten days in advance or by bacterial infection, which can develop days later. This may have triggered the first two cases of vomiting. The uneasiness and smell caused the other passengers to throw up, said a member of the committee.It is true that food poisoning could be caused by bacterial growth after consumption of stale food over a period of days. The same is referred to as gestation and the poisoning may be triggered after consumption of other meals. However, as many as 40 passengers feeling nauseous due to the air-conditioning in the coach is something which should be checked, said Manish Deliwala, a general physician based out of Chembur.The Food and Drug Administration of Maharashtra said they were not sent any food samples from the meals served on the train for testing. The railways has not asked us for any inspection. As per protocol, they have their own food safety officer to test the food samples, said Maharashtra FDA Commissioner Pallavi Darade.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

They first shot the guard and then entered the building. They started throwing grenades and firing, said Shamshad TV reporter Faisal Zaland, who escaped through a back door.Shamshad TV, a Pashto language station that broadcasts nationwide, was transmitting a holding image instead of its normal programming.Zaland told AFP that security forces were in the area of the Shamshad compound in the Afghan capital trying to bring down the attackers. Many of my colleagues are still in the building, he added.Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid denied the militant group was involved in the attack in a Twitter post. The interior ministry told AFP that t was investigating the incident but had no further details.Kabul has been rocked by a series of deadly attacks in recent weeks as the Taliban and Islamic State insurgents step up offensives against security installations and mosques.Last Tuesday a suicide bomber, believed to have been as young as 12, struck Kabuls heavily fortified diplomatic quarter and killed at least five people, showing that militants can still hit the heart of the city despite tighter security.Security in Kabul has been ramped up since a 31 May truck bomb went off on the edge of the so-called Green Zone, killing around 150 people and wounding 400 others. Special truck scanners, barriers and permanent and mobile checkpoints have been rolled out across the city.The last major assault in Kabul was on 21 October when a suicide attacker hit a busload of Afghan army trainees, killing 15. On 20 October a suicide bomber pretending to be a worshipper blew himself up inside a Shiite mosque in the city during evening prayers, killing 56 and wounding 55.Earlier this month Kabul police stopped a lorry carrying 2,700 kilograms (nearly 6,000 pounds) of explosives hidden under boxes of tomatoes, averting a potentially deadly blast."

(Source: Reuters) A vendor sorts her tomatoes at a market outside of Harare. (Source: Reuters)Zimbabwe banned fruit and vegetable imports on Tuesday to preserve its dwindling reserves of hard currency, drawing immediate warnings of food shortages. The order, which followed a ban on maize imports in June, alarmed retailers and street dealers in the capital Harare who get much of their produce from neighbouring South Africa. The shutdown, which Agriculture Minister Joseph Made said was immediate, underlined the scale of the economic crisis in what was once one of southern Africas agricultural heartlands, in the build-up to next years national elections. Made told the Herald newspaper that veteran President Robert Mugabe had made the order himself to stop the imports because they waste much needed foreign currency.This means that the importation of fruit and vegetables will be stopped immediately. We are finalising on the exact list of foreign-produced fruits that are occupying shelves in shops, Made said. The order would let local farmers increase output, he added.The minister declined to give further details when contacted by Reuters. It cant be a blanket ban since we are not producing as much fruit and vegetables to adequately supply the local market, said the head of the Confederation of Zimbabwe Retailers, Denford Mutashu. We would need to review this.GRAPES, MANGOES, PLUMSShopper Erica Juma said she doubted Zimbabwe would be able to satisfy local demand by itself. If we can produce enough there is no problem with the ban. But I doubt we are able to, Juma said, while picking up South African grapes in Pick n Pay supermarket for her lunch in central Harare.At a busy road intersection, street hawker Sam Nyandima said the ban would hit his supplies. We survive on selling fruits to motorists. If they go ahead with this ban it will badly affect our livelihoods, he said, as he sold pawpaw, mangoes and plums in the blazing sun.The country dumped its currency for the US dollar in 2009 because it was wrecked by hyperinflation but it is now running short of dollars as well as quasi-currency bond note introduced last year to ease cash shortages.Zimbabwes latest currency crisis is blamed on low export earnings, increased government domestic borrowing that has increased money supply not matched by dollar inflows and high govermnment spending, 90 percent which goes to salaries.Commercial agriculture has not recovered from the hit it took after 2000 from Mugabes seizures of land from white farmers. Last year Zimbabwe spent more than $80 million on fruit and vegetables imports, according to national statistics agency Zimstat.Many Zimbabweans keep stashes of USdollars at home, or resort to buying hard currency on the black market when they want to travel or pay for imports.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

5a155b8c9855b76bf13ed94f,Eating Bengal,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1171001/jsp/opinion/story_175573.jsp,2017-10-01,,Telegraph,"For the non-Bengali like me, Puja tourism is about food. In the early Nineties, when I first began visiting pandals in Chittaranjan Park, I was baffled by the non-doing nature of the main enclosure that hosted the pratima. We seemed always to get there before or after the aarti so to the uninitiated outsider, the setting felt like a prelude to something that never happened. The first time the pandal and the pratima made sense to me as performance was years later while watching the film, Parineeta, when I saw a particularly energetic version of the dhunuchi dance. Except that the principal dancer was Sanjay Dutt and while I'm used to suspending disbelief at the pictures, it was hard to take in Munna Bhai in this new bhadralok avatar without giggling. I think one of the reasons people inspect the pratima so closely is that for the most part, there's so little else to do. I used to pay particular attention to the slain (or in the process of being slain) Mahishasura for the same reason that people watch action movies: for the gore. The first year that I toured the pandals, the Mahishasuras were small, pitiable figures, notable mainly for the bloody wound that Durga's trident had made, but I later encountered large, heavily muscled versions. What they had in common was a haplessness that was oddly moving. Durga herself seemed oblivious to the asura she had killed, as she looked into the middle distance, remotely smiling. It was her lion that seemed properly involved in the slaughter, his bloodied teeth and claws dug into Mahishasura's body which was often a bilious green and who can blame him? The saddest figure in the composition was the discarded buffalo, supine and hollowed out at the base of the tableau, like a filmi extra. My disenchantment with the tableaux had something to do with the fact that the first one I saw had Durga as a dead ringer for Hema Malini. The prig in me was offended: I had come looking for Bengali iconography and had found a still from a Bombay mythological instead. Looking back, though, I can see the point of the likeness: if the artist had been looking to model beatific blandness, he couldn't have done better. It was in the food stalls that I found consolation, in the deep fried, keema-stuffed porotas made out of maida. As someone born and raised in Delhi on first-rate Punjabi parathas, after that first taste of the Bengali version, I couldn't understand why north Indians bothered with aata when maida's elastic chewiness was self-evidently better. The same principle holds for pooris; why not, in a frank, manly way acknowledge superiority and eat luchis instead? The first time I encountered festive Bengali food was in 1983 when I travelled up to Calcutta for a friend's wedding. We stayed with the groom in his parents' house for several days and on the first day we settled down to eat lunch at a very long table flanked by benches. It was a catered meal and I still remember the name of the caterer: Bijoli Grill. We were served rice and dal and mashed potatoes which, in retrospect, I recognize as alu makha but at the time I thought was a kind of alu bharta. The dal was excellent and the sharpness of the mustard oil mixed into the potatoes was a new and adventurous taste. As someone who had been raised a vegetarian before going over to the dark side, I understood dal, chawal and alu and I made a meal of it. I was a little surprised at the plainness of the food, but it was barely noon so I decided it was meant to be a kind of brunch and there were after all, dozens of people to be fed. After stuffing myself, I made to get up and leave. This was awkward because I was sitting on a running bench so the thin young man to my right had to get up as well to make space for me to lever my legs out from under the table. I was midway through this manoeuvre when Mrs Sarkar, Abhijit's mother, materialized in front of me looking concerned. ""Where are you going?"" she asked. ""Is there something wrong with the food?"" I said it was wonderful but I had eaten enough. ""Enough?"" she repeated, baffled. ""But we have just begun!"" I had never eaten a desi meal in courses before. Where I came from you ate your staple - dal, roti, paratha - surrounded by the sabzis and chutneys and raitas and pickles that constituted the meal. An amused Hyderabadi friend once described this to me as 'your katori culture'. So when I was nudged back into my place on the bench, I realized that the wedding guest in Bengal needed to be a long-distance runner. After that initial course, we ate two kinds of fish, rui and ilish. This was followed by a mutton curry which I know now was kosha mangsho. All of this was accompanied by several servings of rice. After we had done with the meat, we moved on to chatni, a tomato chutney mined with dates, raisins and other sweetness that I wasn't sure I liked till I combined it with rice and then it was magical. I was feeling faintly sick by then because I had never eaten so much before and I hadn't paced myself. This was around the time that I began to attend to the thin young man to my right. He was extraordinarily thin, in that hipless, hollow-cheeked way that's special to India. He was virtually two-dimensional. And yet, he made his way through the rui, ilish and mangsho like a human tapeworm, helping himself more than once to each sort of fish and then the mutton and now he was doing a steady free-style through the chatni, never pausing to breathe or burp. We finished with three kinds of mishti; I use 'we' loosely, because I had fallen by the wayside by then. My participation was vicarious; I just watched my neighbour do the treble with ease, this Abebe Bikila of the six-course meal. We ate like this every day, twice a day, for three days. But this, I was assured, was nothing; the pice de rsistance according to the gourmands who surrounded me, was yet to come. These were the king prawns that would be served at the bou bhaat, the reception dinner the day after the wedding. I never got that far; I only ever heard Abhijit's king prawns described because by the evening of the wedding reception, I was a broken man, running a shuttle service to the nearest loo, my digestion destroyed by a regimen of gluttony that asked for more endurance than my north Indian constitution could supply. There is a reason why Abhijit, like many Bengali men, always carries a little pink bottle of Gelusil or its alternative, the orange Aqua Ptychotis. No culture can eat like this without chronic heartburn. But eating was never the same again after that 1983 wedding. I learnt to eat my way through fish heads as they squinted at me, to tease hair-thin bones out of ilish, to lay by enough room for the sweet at the end. When my niece declared the other day that she was going pandal-hopping with friends, I told her to skip the pratimas and home in on the porotas. She was kind enough to report that I was right. It's a simple truth that I learnt three-and-a-half decades ago: Bengali culture is basically food."

I just want the truth to come out.""Mr Banerjee has to report for questioning again tomorrow.He was accused by the woman, a resident of north Bengal, of promising to marry her, cohabiting with her and then dumping her. Her police complaint, filed on October 10, alleges rape. Earlier, she had filed a police complaint at her hometown, Balurghat, and then gone public with intimate photos of the two of them and tweeted to India's vice president, the minister of women welfare and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for help.Mr Banerjee had, however, filed a police complaint on September 6, stating that he had merely tried to help the woman get a student loan and she had tried to blackmail him. He filed an FIR on October 9, a day before she did.In September, just before the case hit the headlines, Mr Banerjee was expelled by his party, the CPM, for a variety of 'personal indiscretions'. His party suspended him in June after it received 19 complaints about alleged ""sexual misconduct"".After the woman's FIR, the CID, given charge of the case, summoned Mr Banerjee twice but he failed to show up. Finally, with the threat of arrest looming over his head, he sought and got anticipatory bail and reported to the police today.The woman is not backing off. Her Twitter status reads, ""Ritabrata is a rapist, womanizer, liar and full of s***. Next time you see him, throw rotten eggs n tomato at him.""Such public exchanges about personal indiscretions are unusual in India, certainly in Indian politics. Though he has been expelled by his party, Mr Banerjee is still a member of the Indian parliament. His term as an 'Independent' ends in 2020."

The government provides only rice to the workers to prepare food and they have to purchase all the ingredients such as oil, tamarind, chilli powder, turmeric, dhania, onions, salt and other food items to be used for preparing curries, apart from eggs and fuel.Big menuThe government is paying Rs. 8.18 paise for each student studying from eight to tenth class and Rs. 6.18 paise for each student from sixth to eighth class and Rs. 4.13 paise for each student from first to fifth class. With the steep increase in prices of all vegetables, including onion, which has crossed Rs. 60 per kilogram, the midday meal workers are forced to cut down on the items on the menu.Before the prices of vegetables increased, we used to serve the food as per menu. But, now it has become very difficult to purchase vegetables and leafy vegetables to prepare curries, said Vasumathi, a midday meal worker of government high school in Karimnagar town. I am unable to buy even leafy vegetables like spinach as it costs Rs. 120 per kilogram, she complained and added she was forced to purchase cheap vegetables like potatoes to serve it to students.No earningsWe are not even getting the income a daily wage worker gets after working from morning to evening preparing food and serving the midday meals to the students, another midday meal worker Lalitha said.

Even cabbage which we could buy for Rs. 15 to Rs. 20 has gone up to Rs. 60, she said.The amount of vegetables coming to Puducherry markets have also reduced by 40 to 50%. Rama Devi, a wholesaler at Goubert market, said: Puducherry requires at least 6,000 tonnes of tomatoes per day but we are now buying only 1,200 tonne.Perumal, another vegetable and fruit wholesale agent, added: The hotels and fast food joints which are the major consumers have reduced their purchase and the sale of vegetables has dropped by 60 to 70%. We are, therefore, purchasing only 50% of what we used to earlier.Many vegetables to Puducherry are transported from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. We get onions, capsicum, brinjal, ladies finger from Chikkaballapur and Bengaluru and tomatoes and cucumber from Andhra Pradesh. We were buying five loads of onions from Bengaluru. It has now reduced to three, he said.Ms. Devi states that the other major reason for the hike in prices was the drastic fall in the vegetable farming in Puducherry. Thengaithittu, Ariyankuppam and many villages surrounding Puducherry were known for their vegetable farming. Ladies finger, greens, brinjal, pumpkins were grown locally. With the conversion of agricultural land to residential plots, the production has fallen. Now, we have to depend on other states for vegetables, she says."

Ole, I said to myself, and landed up there.The restaurant, called The Beer Caf, is present in many parts of Delhi but has just opened up an outlet in Khan Market. Its in the middle lane, on your right if you enter the lane from the Rabindra Nagar side. The cafe is on the second floor (Phone No. 9711316004).Its a neat place, with a bar on one side, comfortable sofas, tables for dining and a small terrace where you can sit and contemplate nature. There is music playing, but not so loud (as it is in several cafes) that you cannot hear yourself think.They have a Spanish theme, but actually it has a lot of other stuff as well  from dim sums and Bruschetta to pasta, pizza and grilled food and from keema pao and biryani to even peanut chaat.But my mind was on Spain, so I was keen on tapas and such like. A platter of tapas  Spanish finger-food  arrived, with pulled chicken, mustard and scallion herb fish, garlic prawn crostini, caprese, marinated olives, pickled gherkins and fried chillies (Rs. 695).The first dish to arrive was a prawn preparation  gambas al ajillo  prawns sizzled with garlic, chilli, parsley, olive oil and lemon (Rs. 425). Then came the pollo al ajillo  pan-seared garlic chicken thigh, sausages and wings (Rs. 375). And then there was coca-Catalan flatbread  oven-roasted vegetables, roasted tomatoes and fresh herbs (Rs. 325).The tapas were good, and I enjoyed the pulled chicken, the caprese  a piece of soft mozzarella and tomato stick  and the garlic prawn crostini served on a piece of small flat bread.The platter included some basa fish, which I politely refused. Basa, in my opinion, is the fish worlds paneer.The main prawn dish was served on a small slice of lemon, which gave it a nice tangy taste. The main flavours for the chicken and prawn dishes were similar, except that the chicken was chilli-hot. I enjoyed both.I liked the Catalan flatbread quite a bit. One, of course, because of the developments in Catalonia, and, two, because it was a crispy thin-crust bread with some delicious roasted toppings.It is almost like a pizza, but without the mandatory tomato sauce. It came with yellow and red roasted peppers, broccoli, zucchini, aubergines and tomatoes. The veggies were juicy, the bread was crisp, and the two complementary textures jived well together. And what added to the taste was the basil, which left its characteristically piquant flavours on the toppings of the flatbread.It was quite a nice meal, and since I was in The Beer Caf, I had some Belgian beer to go along with the food.However, since the caf has a vast wine collection, I think they should tone down their spices so that the food can complement the wine, and vice versa.But the menu is interesting, the place is comfortable and the food, enjoyable.

Part of a group of seven inmates who received their licence, Rupa also appeared for her Class 10 equivalency examination the day before her release. She was also very active in other activities in which the inmates are trained. Once Rupa eases back into her life outside the prison walls, she can use her driving skills to earn a living and stay away from crime, hopes jail superintendent O.V. Valli.The Attakulangara jail has space to accommodate 107 women inmates, but currently has only 60. As a correctional facility, it has been training inmates in various skills to provide them an opportunity to turn their life around when they walk out of here.The food unit at the jail, for instance, churns out nearly 40 products made by three inmates. These include cakes, sweets, munchies, instant snacks, and pickle. For the inmates here, the day starts early  at 2 a.m. By 6 a.m., idli and sambar cooked using traditional idli thattu are ready. The inmates are paid Rs. 48 in wages for their work.Artistic talentWelfare Officer Rekha P. Nair is in charge of the sari design and nettipattam (ornamental caparisons) unit.The sari design unit began by screen printing on Kerala saris, and then moved on to cotton colour saris in December last. The prisoners also make nettipattams and thidambu in various sizes. Some of the inmates are very talented, and their artistic skills and eye for colour are reflected in the products they make, Ms. Rekha Nair says. Owing to the low cost of production, these are available at cheaper rates than those in the market. The sales too are good, she adds.The jails garden boasts of muringa, papaya, plantain, ginger, colocasia, long-podded cowpea, yam, chillies, tomato, brinjal and mushroom cultivation, all tended to by the prisoners. With 700 recently arrived growbags, the cultivation has been expanded further. We believe the veggies here grow especially well because of the care and attention provided by the inmates, the officials say.A teacher trains the inmates in cutting and stitching. The unit has 11 sewing machines. Six prisoners here transform running material into salwar sets, tops, nighties, and underskirts, for sale at the jail and the Free Fashionista counter at the Central Prison. There is also a soap and lotion unit, umbrella unit, and a paper bag unit. Some inmates use the time inside to complete their Class 4 and 7 equivalency courses of the Kerala State Literacy Mission Authority under the supervision of a teacher, while others study even further, the officials say.Joy of readingThe jail has an extensive library with over 6,500 books, and many an inmate is a voracious reader. An FM radio and a television are other sources of entertainment. Not only do the activities keep the inmates occupied, it is often what keeps them looking ahead during their days here.Inmates who are used to keeping busy come asking for work, the officials say. Once an initial batch is trained in some skill, they train a few others too.However, because there are very few inmates who are here for long periods, training remains an ongoing process. Ms. Valli says there are many who have used their skills to earn a steady income once they are released.B. Pradeep, Deputy Inspector General of Prisons (South Zone) and Director, State Institute of Correctional Administration (Thiruvananthapuram), says driving and handicraft making were two good initiatives launched recently for prisoners. Some of them are very creative, and we are trying to help them hone their skills so that they can look forward to a self-reliant life once they return to the world out there, he says.Some of the inmates are very talented, and their artistic skills and eye for colour are reflected in the products they make.Rekha P.

5a1579309855b76bf13ee537,Bhog for Pujo: It's time to dine with the goddess!,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bhog-for-pujo-its-time-to-dine-with-the-goddess/articleshow/60871765.cms,2017-09-29,,The Times Of India,"'Head to Congress Bhavan. They have the best chingri maach. Also, the kosha mangsho at Bhosale Nagar is to die for!'During Pujo, besides festive pleasantries, we can bet that the next most important topic of discussion among Bengalis is what one can eat and where - such is their love for food! Be that as it may, the real charm, however, lies in the simple 'bhog' (an offering to Ma Durga) served during the festival.Close to lunch hours, it's common to see people partaking in the meal on sal leaf or dona plates as dada-boudis and elderly kaku-kakimas attend to them. An honest celebration of community, we couldn't think someone better than 68-year-old Moni Das to tell us more about this divine meal.We meet Moni, the head cook of Pune Kali Bari (one of the city's oldest pujas), in a makeshift mandap beside the pandal. Sporting a checked gamccha, he oversees his team that readies the day's bhog . They stir enormous steel patilas of food, as myriad aromas arise and engulf us. ""We've been cooking since 5 am,"" he tells us. While Moni captains the ship, he has 15 men assisting him, and an additional 10 men packing food parcels for visitors who won't be eating at Pune Kali Bari.Having used over 40 kilos of paneer, 40 kilos of peas, 50 kilos of potatoes, 200 kilos of rice and about 200 litres of milk, Moni assures us that the food will be more than sufficient. ""10 people can have a kilo of bhog'er khichuri. Going by that estimation, we cook according to the day and its expected footfall. Ashtami and Navami see maximum attendance. That's when we cook for 3000-plus people,"" Moni adds. Clearly, catering for so many has become second nature for him, given that he has been cooking for Pune Kali Bari since 1979.The quintessential meal is a simple one, merely representing a lavish Bengali meal for everyone to partake in. Moni tells us that the line-up usually comprises, but isn't restricted to, flavoursome bhog'er khichuri (prepared from special Gobindobhog rice, moong dal and vegetables; except onions and garlic), labra (Bengali-style mixed vegetable), a sweet-tangy date and tomato chutney, beguni (a fried brinjal savoury) followed by payesh (rich Bengali rice kheer). On Saptami, Pune Kali Bari served devotees a Bengali-style pulao, chana dal, aloo-mattar-paneer, chutney and payesh. Today's menu will be the aforementioned standard one.Moni says, ""Panch phoron (five-spice masala) is most important for preparing khichuri, labra and chutney. If it is prepared here, the flavours don't match up to what you get in Bengal. Hence we source the masala and Gobindobhog rice from Kolkata."" Another key element is the bhaja masala gudi (dry-roasted and ground masala) that's added to the khichuri along with ghee before serving.Besides Durga Puja, Moni is busy during other pujas at Pune Kali Bari, namely amavasya puja, Annapurna puja, Saraswati Puja, Laxmi Puja and Kali Puja, to name some. Besides seeking Durga's blessings, he is also reason why many love visiting  to tuck into the familiar, homely meal they look forward to. Rest assured, when you visit today, the taste and flavour will be just like what you relished last year.According to consulting Indologist Urmi Chanda-Vaz , socially, Durga Puja in its present form was started in the early 16th century by Bengal's rajas and zamindars. ""They instituted the festival in their palatial homes as a show of authority or autonomy against the British. Gradually, it became an opportunity to flaunt wealth and social status. They would organise grand feasts and committed acts of charity. The grander the feast, the more the social prestige,"" she says.But the gastronomic excesses are also justified with an emotional narrative. Rina Pradhan, a member of Anandam Association, explains, ""We liken Ma Durga's visit to the arrival of a married daughter to her parent's house. Her spending these five days with us brings immense happiness. She is thus pampered with the most delectable traditional food in the form of bhog."" According to Urmi, the offerings in West Bengal are mostly vegetarian, but the East of Bengal (now Bangladesh) offer the goddess non-vegetarian fare, including meat and fish.'Bhog' means an offering to the goddess. Once she has ritually 'eaten' it, it becomes prasad. And it is this prasad that people eat. It's a misnomer when people say they are going to eat bhog.

Balakrishna, employee of a private organisation, was surprised to see the empty beverages counter during the intermission of a cinema at a multiplex a couple of days ago. With limited options available at the counter, all he could get is an overflowing tub of tomato-chilli popcorn for Rs. 250 before settling down to watch the rest of the film.The experience of watching movies in swanky and ritzy world of multiplexes comes at a price even for those who enter the cinema halls with loaded wallets. A small family of three members is sure to shell out Rs. 4,000-Rs. 5,000 for entertainment in a multiplex cinema hall a month.Every time, I end up emptying my wallet paying dearly for a range of snacks served at the counters as my wife and daughter cannot do without indulging in munchies and refreshments, said K. Ganababu, who works in a private hospital. However, what came as a relief to movie-goers is that they can now get refreshments at maximum retail price as Collector Pravin Kumar directed multiplexes not to charge them above theMRP.The well-stocked racks at the counters now wear a empty look as the multiplexes have stopped selling water bottles, popular beverages and packaged food stuff sourced from select channels. Products procured from select channels have been returned to the respective dealers and fresh stocks are yet to arrive from the makers, said a multiplex theatre manager.Cine-goers heave a sigh of relief as they can now settle for some edible stuff at an affordable price in the multiplexes. Asked whether the drop in price is also applicable to pizzas, samosas and sandwiches available at the counters, a multiplex theatre manager said there was no clarity on rates of such snacks.According to divisional vice-chairman of National Consumer Rights Commission M. Vyas Goud, the order was issued following constant representations by people who expressed their concern over dual pricing of snacks and beverages at the multiplex theatres.Assistant Controller of Department of Legal Metrology P. Sudhakar asked consumers to be aware of their rights and report to the authorities if they come across any deviation in rules on MRP."
5a1598079855b76bf13eeddf,Are vertical farms the way forward for Bengaluru?,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/are-vertical-farms-the-way-forward-for-bengaluru/articleshow/60982425.cms,2017-10-08,,The Times Of India,"Pollution and space restraints  something that Bengalureans tackle every single day. Scarcity of water and erratic climate changes have become unfortunate realities, but we still carry on leading our lives in traditional ways that were meant for a plentiful world. It is said that by 2050, there will be well over nine billion people in the world, and 70% of them will live in urban areas. As a result, there is bound to be food shortage and food security issues. This is why 23-year-old Rutusha Nagaraj Kapini , a fresh graduate of The Oxford School of Architecture , picked vertical farming as the topic for her thesis, which, she says, is the way forward in an urban metropolis like Bengaluru. And such was her research into the topic that she received two awards for it  Zonal Winner, Council of Architecture National Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Architectural Thesis 2017 (top 10 in Zone 4) and Archi Design Best Thesis of the Year Award 2016 (Student of the Year Award  national level).For her thesis, Rutusha had to find an innovative solution to the following problem: 'Increasing population has drastically reduced farming lands. Raw food, such as vegetables and fruits, are loaded with toxic chemicals and pesticides'. Having attended the All India Convention of Architects in 2008 (both her parents are architects), Rutusha was inspired by Dr Dickson Despommier 's speech  he is considered the father of vertical farming. ""He spoke about how vertical farming can be beneficial in urban populated cities in India, as it can produce nutritious food that one can access within the city. He is the reason I picked this topic,"" she says.So, what did Rutusha discover through research for her thesis? She found that vertical farming could be an innovative model through architectural design intervention, which minimizes land usage, while still feeding the population. The environmentally-conscious and ecological design is conceived as a network of facilities, with training centres for farmers, and creating bioclimatic buildings of the future  Verti Farms. Throwing more light on the topic, Rutusha says, ""Bioclimatic buildings are those that respond to climate; verti farms are inside these buildings. The buildings create an artificial environment within them and are not completely dependent on natural resources. So, design plays a big role. For e.g., they will have solar tubes through which natural sunlight enters the building. There will also be LED light farming (certain LED lights help plants grow). Each of the planters will be placed on rotational carousels within the building. There will be mirrors on the walls that will reflect the natural sunlight (the buildings will not be completely closed and the openings will be protected with stainless-steel meshes). The carousels will be placed in stacked heights; there will be one water inlet source, and since the platforms rotate, the water will be drained out at a single drain pipe, which will lead to the central service core that will be connected to a sewerage treatment plant."" Through this method, she adds, only 5% of water is required for five times the yield. Also, changes in weather will not affect the crops much as the environment within the building is controlled.To get a better idea of how verti farms work, Rutusha went to Singapore for a live study of the Sky Greens there. Having done sufficient research, she has identified a vacant plot of land near Lalbagh that can be put to productive use by setting up India's first vertical farm there. ""The government already has HOPCOMS set up in many places; similarly, they could allot land to verti farms. These can serve as interactive spaces for the public, which would encourage them to adapt it on smaller scales, such as at apartment complexes and private layouts. It can even serve as local marketplaces, where the produce is sold fresh,"" says Rutusha. But wouldn't this harm the income of farmers? ""No,"" says Rutusha, explaining, ""Farmers will be required to work on verti farms. Each building will have training centres for the farmers  it will be a free course. Crops often fail due to erratic climate changes, but verti farms reduce that risk, since they are not completely dependent on natural forces. So, farmers will actually be able to generate a steady income.""What is interesting is that verti farms cater to city-specific needs. This reflects in the plants that can be grown in them  fruits and vegetables that we use for daily consumption. This includes tomato, peas, brinjal, curry leaves, basil, lettuce, mint, cauliflower, spring onions, okra, cucumber, lemons and broccoli, among others.The organic building that Rutusha has proposed will be expensive initially, but, she says, costs will breakeven after five years, after which it will be profitable. ""A 10-acre site in Lalbagh can accommodate two high-rise verti farms. On the same land, I have proposed the setting up of training and research centres, a local market and an interactive space. All this can be built at an estimated cost of Rs 200 crore,"" says Rutusha.The young architect wants to continue research on the subject through a Master programme, apart from creating a startup to convert her thesis into a viable business model. If her efforts come to fruition, Bengaluru could very well be home to India's first vertical farm."

Under the scheme, Rs 8,000 per acre will be directly credited to bank accounts of farmers who have grown tomato crops. Officials will inspect farms 45 days after tomato seeds are sown, following which the amount will be credited to farmers' accounts.Tomatoes are currently being sold at Rs 50-80 per kilo in Gurgaon and other NCR cities. Seeds for the crop are sown in January and February, and the fruits are ready for harvest by April-May. The agriculture department has set a target of 400 hectares to grow tomatoes in the coming season.On Wednesday, Abhilaksh Likhi, principal secretary to the agriculture department, said a monthly plan should be prepared for the new scheme, and soil testing done at the earliest. ""We've set a target to collect and check 12,707 soil samples in Gurgaon by year-end. So far, we have collected 3,600 soil samples, along with 14 samples of manure, two of pesticides and 24 of seeds,"" said Likhi.In total, around 60,000 soil health cards are expected to be distributed among farmers, which will contain analysis that tells farmers which crop their land is best suited for.Likhi has instructed district officials to implement the scheme properly, so that maximum number of farmers can benefit from it. Officials have been asked to visit villages and farmers' meetings to inform them of the scheme and distribute soil health cards.""Tomato is an important ingredient in most dishes. It gets really expensive this time of the year. I'm hoping this initiative will help regulate prices,"" said Aastha Popli, a marketing executive.""Although I expect tomato prices to come down, it won't fall quickly enough to provide relief to customers. We've had to put up with high tomato prices. This has affected our budget and what we cook. Still, I hope prices go down soon,"" said Shabnam Kohli, a Sushant Lok resident."

Picture by Prashant Mitra Inundation of several roads and bridges is threatening to snap the supply of essential commodities, including fruits and vegetables, to Ranchi and jack up prices in the wholesale and retail markets. Sources in the transport circuit said a bridge over Koel river in Basia, Gumla, went underwater on Wednesday, leaving 100trucks bound for the capital stranded at various locations. Similarly, rainwater flowing over a bridge near Bero in Mandar block has halted the supply of essentials coming from Lohardaga and Daltonganj (Palamau). ""The Ranchi-Simdega road, which extends till Odisha, is out of bounds for traffic since the Koel bridge was inundated. We have suspended all buses (around 30) to Simdega and beyond. At least 100trucks bringing supplies from different states are stranded,"" said Kishore Mantri, the general secretary of Ranchi Bus Owners' Association. Mantri added that vehicular movements on Ranchi-Lohardaga and Ranchi-Daltonganj routes were as badly hit. Suresh Kumar, who drives a bus on Ranchi-Daltonganj stretch, said a portion of a small bridge near Pakhria in Chanho on NH-75 was witnessing erosion. ""Portions of the bridge have become very narrow, leading to long snarls. More rain can snap this link too,"" he said. On Ranchi-Hazaribagh-Patna route (NH-33), a landslide threat has emerged near Chuttupalu valley in Ramgarh after heavy rain loosened boulders. The Ranchi-Bokaro road via Sikidiri and Ranchi-Silli road are also out of bounds owing to flooding of a bridge and road cave-in in Silli two days ago. Sunil Chauhan, vice-president of Ranchi Goods Transporters Association, said consignments from Bengal had remained affected for two-three days. ""Potatoes, vegetables and flowers come from Bengal and other states to Ranchi via Baharagora, and this link has taken a beating. Vegetable prices are likely to rise,"" Chauhan said, adding that roughly 100 trucks brought essential items to Ranchi and more than 50 were stranded. A senior official of a retail supermarket chain said for three days now, they were facing crisis of vegetables. ""Our stocks come from Silli and Gola, but many roads and bridges have been washed away along the route, and there is no supply. In Brambe (on Ranchi's outskirts), where we do bulk procurement, local markets are closed owing to incessant rain. We are somehow managing with vegetables bought from Pithoria,"" he said, adding that almost all their outlets in Ranchi and Jamshedpur were facing the crunch. ""For our 50-odd stores in Ranchi and Jamshedpur, we require 10 tonnes of vegetables a day, but are doing with less than half the stocks."" The humble potato will soon be too hot to handle, the supermarket official warned. ""Potatoes mostly come from Bengal. As per norms, they are first dried after being taken out of cold storage before being dispatched. Heavy rain in Bengal has hit stocks,"" he said. In retail markets, the price of tomato has shot up to Rs 120 notwithstanding the state food and civil supplies department's order to FJCCI to cap the rate at Rs 80. Green vegetables like beans and cauliflower are acting pricey too. Beans are selling at Rs 30 per 250gm while a small cauliflower also has a price tag of Rs 30.

5a1739449855b76bf13f00cc,Garden without pests is like life without problems,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2017/nov/07/garden-without-pests-is-like-life-without-problems-1694976.html,2017-11-07,,The New Indian Express,"CHENNAI: Like them or hate them, insects will be a part of your garden and they are here to stay. What is a garden without insects ? Its like life without problems! The most common insects that can create havoc are mealy bugs, aphids and spider mites.Leaf Miner: These minute insects form lines on the leaves. They usually dont harm the plant much, but its advisable to discard the leaves, else they can affect the whole plant.Mealy bugsThese are soft cottony looking insectsAphidsThese are tiny dark coloured insects.Aphids and mealy bugs can spread very quickly if not detected at an early stage. They are sap sucking insects and are mostly found on the stem and branches and at the back side of the leaves.Spider mitesAre extremely tiny insects and usually found on the underside of the leaves. They form web like structure and make holes through the leaf.Some common remedies are described belowAlthough organic pesticides are tempting, water jet spray and wiping with hand is a better option to clean off the insects from the plant. A jet spray from the watering hose pipe is very effective compared to spraying from a bottle. Give the affected part of the plant a complete wash. Wait for a few days and see if they come back. Give a second wash if necessary. Following are some alternative options in case the pests returns:Neem oil : Add 20 ml of neem oil and 5 drops of liquid handwash to 1 litre of water. Mix it well and spray generously all over the affected parts of the plant. The liquid handwash helps the neem oil to stick on the plants and protect it.3G formula : Grind 100g each of ginger, green chillies and garlic to paste. Take 5 ml of this paste and mix with one litre water and spray. Use once in 10 days.Wood Ash : Sprinkle wood ash on the plant, preferably from wood that has not been chemically treated. You can also sprinkle homa ash on the affected leave and around the top soil of the pot.Once you have an attack of aphids and luck shines upon you, a very friendly visitor, the ladybug or lady beetle may appear to feast on these aphids. Other insects / reptiles such as lizards and grasshoppers also help in controlling the pest population in a garden.Another indicator of an aphid infection is the presence of ants on the plant. Ants do not directly harm the plants, but they help spreading and protecting the mealybugs and the aphids. The mealybugs and aphids take off nutrition from the plants and the ants then feed on them. So once you see ants on your plants, there is a good chance that there is something buggy going on. Most of these insects will be on the back side of the leaves, so it is difficult to spot them.Some gardeners spray the neem oil mix (as mentioned above) on a regular basis. But this is usually not a good option since it works like taking a paracetamol in advance to prevent from falling sick. Instead , it is suggested to spend time on making the soil rich enough that it has good amount of nutrition to keep the plant healthy and be able to fight pests.Just like humans and animals fall sick, so do plants. This usually happens when plants are weak due to lack of nutrition or care. Providing nutrition on a regular basis helps the plant growth. For example, a tomato plant takes about 1.5 months to start flowering. Till this point of time, the nutrition present in the initial potting mix is used up. The plant needs more nutrition during the flowering and fruiting period. So starting from the flowering stage, provide additional nutrition to the plant. Some methods of enriching the soil are below:Leaf MinerThese minute insects form lines on the leaves. They usually dont harm the plant much, but its advisable to discard the leaves, else they can affect the whole plant.Stem/shoot/fruit borerThese insects basically lay their eggs in the stem or the fruit of the plant. As the caterpillar develops, it destroys the fruit/stem. Most commonly seen on gourds and brinjals. Phermone traps can be used to trap these insects.Different types of CompostRemove approx 1 inch of the top layer of the soil and 1-2 handfuls of compost and cover with the soil again. General recommendation is to do this once in 2 weeks. Make sure that you do not disturb the root structure.Liquid fertilisers like Panchgavya (PG) and Jeeva Amrut (JA) help in quick nutrient absorption from the soil. PG and JA are usually available with folks who have cows (preferably desi cows) in their farms. Making them is a rather long process and the ingredients are not easily available for an average urban gardener. Hence they usually prefer to buy these instead of making them on their own.TIPWhen opening the PG bottle for the first time, make sure you direct the opening away from you and slowly twist open the cap in an open place. Else it may fizz out like a cola drink! For first timers, PG smells can be intimidating.Jeevamruta (JA)is similar to PG, but with lesser ingredients viz, cow urine, cow dung, jaggery, besan (bengal gram) powder and untouched top soil. The microbial activity n JA is at it peak around the 3rd/4th day of preparation. Check with supplier for when to use & dilution details.Panchgavya (PG) : is made out of five ingredients and hence its name  cow dung, cow urine, cow milk, ghee and curd. Bananas and jaggery are also added. To use PG, one needs to dilute 20-30 ml of PG into 1 liter of water and water the plants with this diluted mix. There might be slight variation in how PG is prepared, so check with the supplier about dilution details and its life. On an average, one can use it once in a month."

Their bright plumage fanned out regally, they strut about without the fear of being trapped or killed. The area has turned into a safe haven for the national bird and perhaps has the largest concentration of these birds at one place in the state. ""Though a scientific survey of the birds has never been conducted, but ocular estimates put their number around 1,500,"" said Ghumsar south divisional forest officer Bijay Ketan Acharya. With the forest officials and the local peacock protection committee, a volunteers' body, taking care to ensure that peacocks are not harmed in any way, the birds feel completely secure at Pakidi, a protected forest area spread over 480 hectares. The birds frequently descend from the hill and roam about at the periphery villages feeding on leftover food and drinking water from the artificial tanks constructed by the committee. ""So far, we have not come across any case of intentional killing of these birds. People residing at 20 villages around the hill love peacocks and will not harm them,"" said Acharya. At Chermaria, one of these villages, located about 8km from Aska town, the forest department has set up an eco cottage, where tourists can stay and enjoy the scenic beauty of the hill and the surrounding. Local peacock protection committee president Samir Pradhan said the forest department co-operated with them in protecting the peacocks. ""The birds love ripe tomatoes and red chillies, which are found in abundance at our villages. Sometimes we have to protect the crops from them, but no one ever harms the birds. We also keep pots filled with water for the peacocks to slake their thirst,"" Pradhan said. However in 2011, 10 peacocks had died at Pakidi after feeding on cotton fields sprinkled with pesticides. The issue had led to a confrontation between the forest and agriculture departments with both pointing accusing fingers at each other. ""However, things have been fine since then. The birds are perfectly safe at Pakidi,"" Acharya said."

Rainwater from the market complex drains into the Cooum through a channel near Daniel Thomas Matriculation School on Poonamallee High Road ""Despite repeated requests, CMDA refused to clear the water channel.

If the restaurant is allowed to come up, it will permanently seal the channel,"" said advisor to the Koyambedu Vegetable Market Wholesale Traders Association, V R Soundararjan. ""Footfall reduces every monsoon due to poor maintenance of the market complex. Authorities must ensure that traders dump vegetable waste only in bins. Fogging must be carried out regularly to control mosquito breeding in the market complex,"" he said.Traders said prices of vegetables have gone up due to heavy rainfall that damaged crops in Karnataka and western Tamil Nadu .

Situated beside a granary in Chawri Bazar, it has been serving fruit sandwiches since 1948.The sandwiches, with apple, chiku, pineapple, and grape stuffed between slices of white bread, are a delicacy you will probably not find anywhere else in the Capital.The basic ingredients of each fruit sandwich, besides the fruit, are white cream, home-made paneer and sugary kesar chutney. Some of the specialties are seasonal, but the rule doesnt apply to all seasonal produce. The mango sandwich, for instance, is available round the year. They also serve toasted sandwiches with a simple filling of tomatoes and cucumber.The area where the Jain Coffee House is located has a colourful history. It was a red-light district during the Mughal era. Serious-minded city explorers, however, visit the area to photograph crumbling old balconies and try delicious streetside, vegetarian-only snacks such as aloo tikkis, gol-gappas and bedmi puri.If you dont have a taste for fruit sandwiches, you might like the savoury namkeen sandwich layered with paneer, tomato slices, pomegranate seeds, and flavoured with coriander leaves and light spices.The dimly lit coffee house is owned by a family of grain merchants from north Delhis Kanhaiya Nagar. A few assistants spend the day placing sliced tomatoes on slices of white bread. Its founder, Lala Shambhu Dayal Jain, had migrated to the city from Shikarpur in western Uttar Pradesh.The coffee house also serves fruit shakes. But you should wash down the sandwiches with its excellent ginger-flavoured chai.Sadly, Jain Coffee House doesnt have patience for people who like to sit for hours over a single cup of coffee. A Hindi-language notice on the wall warns the customer not to waste our time by idling in the shop."

Her two sons recently finished business studies (Akhil from Shanghai, Rohan from Chicago). She is a practitioner and teacher of Alternative Therapy. We are in her apartment because she has promised to cook us authentic Sindhi food. This is a special treat because we havent found any Sindhi restaurants in the Capital yet.Ms Hemrajanis parents were originally based in Sindhs Manjhand town. She has never been to her ancestral land. In fact, she is so well-entrenched in the upper echelons of Delhi society that it is astonishing when she tells us, Im a Bombay girl, born and raised Daddy was a struggling businessman. Mummy would look after us seven siblings. We all grew up in a one-room home.The household budget was always tight and Ms Hemrajani remembers that each kid would receive exactly two meat pieces in their biryani, whenever it was cooked. The fact that her father always bought sava-kilo meat is so deeply imprinted in her memory that to this day she also buys the same quantity of mutton.Every weekend mummy would bake caramel pudding which would be served only to Daddy.Ms Hemrajani is making Daal Pakwan for us today because its simple to make and my friends love this dish and it makes for a great Sunday brunch.We must add that Ms Hemrajani is helped in the kitchen by Sushila, who has been working with her for 10 years.INGREDIENTSOne cup chana daal (soaked for 3-4 hours)2 green chillies1 medium tomato cut into 2 piecesHaldiSaltFOR TEMPERING2 tsp Ghee1 tsp Amchur1 tsp Dhania powder1 tsp Jeera1/2 tsp Red chilliACCOMPANIMENTSChopped onionGreen coriander mint chutneyMeethi tamarind chutneyFOR PAKWAN1 cup whole wheat flour (or maida)1/2 tsp ajwainOil for fryingMETHODBoil chana dal in a pressure cooker with chopped chillies, tomatoes, haldi and salt.Once cooked, remove the skin of the tomatoes, and mix them whole in the daal.Transfer the dal into a bowl.

Indeed, in the case of movies like Darren Aronofskys mother! and  Ill never forget this  2007 Best Picture Oscar-winner No Country for Old Men, that wait never ended.But another thing happens in the weeks you spend in anticipation of a new film: You read about it online. Theres no avoiding it. Tweets, hourly updates on Rotten Tomatoes scores, tweets about hourly updates on Rotten Tomatoes scores; they hound you like injustice hounds Hercule Poirot. So while Ive successfully managed to stick to my rule of not reading professional reviews before having seen the film, I could not avoid some of the more colourful headlines.While most of them were evidently quite pleased with Kenneth Branaghs film, one of the recurring observations however, was that he didnt seem to have introduced enough new ideas to justify another adaptation of Agatha Christies celebrated novel. After all, they pointed out, Sidney Lumets 1974 adaptation is still held in the highest regard.Having finally seen the new Murder on the Orient Express  eagerly, hungrily, as a lifelong fan  I cannot disagree more. Not only has Branagh retained the old-world charm and the exotic romanticism of Christies novels, he has found dimensions to the Dames stories that I  despite having read all her books to the point that they were under physical threat of disintegration  had never expected, and honestly, never even thought of.And Branagh begins his deviation from tradition from the first scene of the Murder on the Orient Express, in which he establishes a new sort of Hercule Poirot. We already know of his famous moustaches and his legendary grey cells (he never shuts up about them, does he?), but have we ever wondered (or even felt the need to learn more) about him as a human being?As masterful as Christies writing was  it is said that such was her genius that she could knock a new mystery out in a week  it was always cool and clinical, oddly unsentimental and emotionally distant. She was always deliberately vague about revealing too much about Poirot, too. He is an enigmatically peculiar man, remembered more for his distinct physical appearance, his idiosyncrasies and eccentricities than anything else  not unlike Sherlock Holmes, James Bond or Tintin. We know nothing about his motivations, and even less about his past.Perhaps he operates out of ego  that is the most likely solution to his mystery. After all, Christie once described him as a detestable, bombastic, tiresome, ego-centric little creep. But in the opening scene of this film, after Poirot has, with trademark theatricality, pronounced a lawman as guilty of a crime, he turns away and immediately steps into a pile of dung. He glances down at the damage with an expression as blank as his character has been for more than a century, and in one innocuous move, alters it forever. Instead of cleaning the soiled shoe, he sinks his other, pristine foot into the dung as well.There is right, there is wrong, he declares to the utterly bamboozled man assigned the difficult task of escorting him to the Istanbul train station, in what is surely his attempt at an explanation. There is no in between.Branagh  despite having a head that isnt in the least shaped like an egg, and moustaches that (while being undeniably grand) arent at all like Christie described in the books  comes as close as any actor has come to capturing Poirots spirit, perhaps even more than Albert Finney, Peter Ustinov, or fan-favourite David Suchet. In his OCD, he finds the morality that drives him.And as he did with his Jack Ryan adaptation, Branagh (rather shamelessly) hogs the limelight, and delivers a performance so overwhelming that it threatens to derail most everything else. As Lumet did in his 1974 film, he assembles an all-star cast  Daisy Ridley, Michelle Pfeiffer, Penelope Cruz, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe and Johnny Depp step into their snazziest outfits and paste the gravest expressions on their faces to play suspects in what has to be, undeniably, the mother of all locked-room murder mysteries.By the way, heres the premise (in case youre still, even after 83 years, unfamiliar with it): While being snowed in during an overnight storm, a man is (brutally) killed on board the luxurious Orient Express, and only one of the 13 passengers on the first class compartment could have done it. Fortunately, through sheer luck, The Greatest Detective in the World also happens to be present, and is compelled  now we know why  to bring balance to this world.Branagh translates what is, by definition, a very stagey story through good, old-fashioned filmmaking. His direction is  elevated by Haris Zambarloukos stunning cinematography and Patrick Doyles lush orchestral score  as flamboyant as his performance. The same 65mm cameras that framed his stoic face in Christopher Nolans Dunkirk waltz around him in Murder on the Orient Express, alternating between intricate tracking shots, omnipotent overhead angles, and careful close-ups.There are however, some nagging issues  like every train journey youve ever been on, after the excitement of departure has died down, and before the eagerness of arrival has set in, there is a palpable lag during the second-act; and despite populating his cast with such splendid faces, theres little they are given to do to fuel the proceedings. Another cause for concern is how the films ending will play for those whove never experienced it. A lot relies on the reveal  its when Poirot is in his element, after all  and I wonder if Branaghs decision to simplify Christies labyrinthine plotting will affect the film in any way.But all these are minor quibbles. When the moment finally arrives  the suspects seated before him in a tableau reminiscent of the Last Supper, and the Orient Express looming large in the background  Branagh delivers his most moving surprise yet.As his impeccable hair falls out of place, and fresh snow sticks to his coat  a matter that would have at any other time caused him more pain than a bullet wound, and as Patrick Doyles score reaches crescendo and his voice quivers with emotion weve never heard before, Branagh unleashes a wallop of raw, unexpected sentimentality thatll strike you with the force of a steam engine.Broken souls are mended, old wounds are healed and order has been restored to the world; the Orient Express, is back on track. As the train finally arrives at its destination - thematically, and literally - Hercule Poirot is summoned to his next adventure. For our sake, lets hope were invited for the ride.Watch the Murder on the Orient Express trailer hereFollow @htshowbiz for moreThe author tweets @RohanNaahar"

Exhibitors count on filling a lot of seats, even if a couple of the new movies were dubbed turkeys by critics.The three-day total for the Last Jedi was just below estimates ranging from $70 million to $80 million. It also was 69% less than what the movie brought in over its first weekend, a larger drop than usual for major blockbusters.The Last Jedi is slowing down at the box office, said Gitesh Pandya of Box Office Guru. Some of the weekends decline is due to Sunday being Christmas Eve, a day thats usually weak, he said. The overall total for Last Jedi is running ahead of last years spinoff Rogue One, indicating a larger part of the Star Wars fan base saw the current movie in its first few days, he said.Jumanji was one of the better-reviewed new movies in wide release.

Photo: ReutersLos Angeles: The Force is strong with this one, too.Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the latest instalment of the epic sci-fi adventure series now owned by Walt Disney Co., met the high expectations set by movie fans and analysts with an opening weekend of $220 million in the US and the Canada.The results, based on estimates released on Sunday by ComScore Inc., put the film squarely ahead of last years spin-off movie Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which took in $158 million in its opening weekend. It will likely establish The Last Jedi as the top-grossing picture of 2017. The new film reaped $230 million in other countries around the world, except China, where it will open next month. Disney had expected $225 million overseas.Disney set a high bar for itself. The first chapter in the latest trilogy, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, took in an all-time North American record of $255 million in its opening weekend in 2015. Independent forecasts for The Last Jedi had run as high as $226 million from the Hollywood Stock Exchange and $210 million from Box Office Pro. Disney predicted the film would take in about $200 million.This just speaks to the power of Disney storytellinghow they are able to get their movies right time after time, said Geetha Ranganathan, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Especially this year when we have so much concern with sequilitis or franchise fatigue.The strong performance of The Last Jedi will reassure investors in Disney, which has at least five more Star Wars films in the works and last week made an even bigger commitment to the film business through its $66.1 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox Inc.s entertainment assets.The Last Jedi was well received by critics, with 96% positive reviews from top critics, according to aggregator RottenTomatoes.com. As they did for previous Star Wars films, fans began lining up outside theatres days before the debut. The film took in $45 million Thursday evening shows in the US and Canada, an amount bested only by The Force Awakens two years ago.To have a movie do $220 million domestically is an extraordinary thing and to be as close to the phenomenon that was The Force Awakens is certainly more than we expected, Dave Hollis, Disneys global head of distribution, said in a telephone interview on Sunday.The movie picks up where that film ended, with Rey, played by Daisy Ridley, seeking out Mark Hamills Luke Skywalker to encourage him to take up his light saber and fight with the Resistance. Carrie Fisher returned as Princess Leia. Fishers death in December 2016, after filming was complete, probably brought fans in to see her final performance.Younger actors, including Adam Driver as bad guy Kylo Ren, and John Boyega and Oscar Isaac, reprising their roles as Resistance fighters Finn and Poe Dameron, no doubt drew in a new generation of devotees.Some viewers have posted negative comments about the movie on RottenTomatoes, while other measures of audience reaction from Cinemascore and ComScore have been positive.Any online debate over the movie is just another reason to see the film, Hollis said. It turns conversation into fuel that ultimately drives people back into movie theatres, he said.Disney didnt disclose the budget of the film. The Force Awakens cost $245 million and brought in $2.07 billion worldwide over its theatrical run, including $936.7 million in North America.Fox offered the only other wide release this weekend with the animated film Ferdinand. It generated $13.3 million while coming in second. The story of a kind-hearted bull trying to find his way back home scored 75% positive reviews from top critics on RottenTomatoes. It had a production budget of $111 million and was projected to place second with $17 million on its debut, according to Box Office Mojo. Bloomberg"

The agriculture ministry thinks so and is hunting for commercially viable proposals in 12 pre-identified areas.The Narendra Modi governments Startup India scheme, which has a Rs10,000 crore war chest managed by the Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi), is seeking to incubate farm-solution startups through a contest called Agriculture Grand Challenge.I urge young entrepreneurs to participate in our newly launched Agriculture Grand Challenge and join forces to make agrarian sector technologically sound and commercially viable, farm minister Radha Mohan Singh said. The idea is to enable entrepreneurship and innovation, he said.A handful of startups for the rural economy are already a part of the growing ecosystem. India has more than 19,000 startups, led by consumer Internet and financial services apps, according to the Economic Survey 2015-16.From 220 in 2014, the number of startups funded in the first 10 months of 2017 stood at 482, according to data from Tracxn.As of December 2015, eight Indian startups belonged to the so-called Unicorn category, a club of ventures valued at $1 billion or more. Yet, fewer than 10% of these cater to the farm or social sector, according to Tracxn.A government document, which Hindustan Times has reviewed, states that private-sector startups could offer viable interventions in an array of areas, notably linking farmers to markets and offering extension services. It seeks to rev up an emerging niche area thats being dubbed as farming as a service, or FAAS.Proposals are being invited for simplified, sensor-based quick testing of soil samples as well as real-time assaying and grading of food commodities in electronically linked eNAM markets. The government has linked 470 mandis electronically but many of them lack crucial infrastructure: food labs to test samples being brought to these markets. The prospective app should preferably enable sample tests under two minutes to promote online trade.The government is interested in apps to connect food processors with agripreneurs and growers, an official said. To help price discovery, the ministry is looking at price forecast apps for pulses, oilseeds, potato, onion and tomato at the time of sowing since these crop are vulnerable to price volatility.According to the document, the success of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Indias main farm insurance scheme, depends on accurate yield estimates at village and farm levels for which it wants to incubate digital technologies.Another priority area is custom hiring of farm machinery and cheaper disposal of crop residue that has become a major reason for pollution in the national capital from neighbouring states during winters.Under the programme, commercially viable ideas will be incubated at the governments expense for three months. The last date for applications is January 15, 2018.Given the high penetration of Internet-enabled mobile phones, this is a good idea that can drive down cultivation costs, said Ashok Duggal, one of the promoters of VentureIndia Labs.A crop of startups aimed at harnessing the rural economy has made inroads already. AgroStar, a Pune-based mobile-commerce firm, directly sells farm inputs to farmers in Maharashtra and has raised more than $4 million. Farmers need to give a missed call to access its services.EM3, another firm, offers farm-labour services at Rs 2,000 an acre of wheat, which it claims is half of what it normally costs during peak season.The government document said it would prefer solutions that are scalable and can reach small farmers.The average size of farm holdings is 1.15 hectares. This means nearly 85% farmers are small and marginal. India has 120 million agricultural land holdings."

Barely three weeks back, 30 to 40 per cent of tomato crops were reportedly damaged.With low-pressure induced overcast condition prevailing in the region for the past five to six days, the temperature variations have enhanced the breeding capacities of pests and fungus. Due to this, vegetable plants are witnessing rotting of leaves and stems, horticulture officers said.While tomatoes, brinjal, cabbage and cauliflower plants have been witnessing the initial stages of fungus and pest attacks, so far reports of attack on capsicum havent cropped up, they added.I have cultivated cauliflower and cabbage over half-an-acre and tomato on another acre. However, signs of pest and fungus attacks have been detected on the standing crop, Manuel Xalxo, a farmer of Karimati village, said.Panposh Assistant Director of Horticulture (ADH) S P Nayak said the the department was keeping a close watch on the situation. We are advising farmers to start blanket spraying of pesticide and fungicide twice a week and later reduce it to once a week, he said.Nuagaon Block Chairman Maklu Ekka, who himself is a farmer, said spraying of pesticide and fungicide would not help until there is adequate sunlight.Small and marginal farmers are facing the real problem as after investing in kharif paddy crops, they have turned to vegetable crops. However, they do not have money for spraying pesticide and fungicide, horticulture officials added.The Block Chairman said areas including Joketa, Goldaru, Karimati,Barilepta, Garda, Sorda, Katepur, Banki, Jhariatola and Limda were reeling under incidents of pest attacks on tomatoes, cabbages and cauliflower crops."

I knew there was a storm brewing in the Bay of Bengal but there was no word on its intensity. I peered around in my womens hostel room and found there was no power as well.I tried to catch some sleep till 6 am, after which I started calling fellow hacks to find out if they faced a similar situation and if they knew when electricity supply would be restored. All of them appeared equally clueless.the Palaiyaru Road in NagercoilCommunication then became a worry as both my mobile phone and the power bank only had half battery charge. The signal from the mobile phone tower was also weak and intermittent. A few hours later, I walked down the street to see if any shops or hotels were open to grab a bite.There was none. With rain pouring down the streets, I knew I couldnt travel long distances. And the streets were either choked with traffic or blocked by collapsed trees.By afternoon, information had trickled in about cyclone Ockhi and I knew we had to be prepared for the worst. I met up other reporters and found all bachelors in the group hadnt had a morsel of food since morning, like me.I quickly filed an initial report to my office, but reaching officials for updates or verification of information was impossible as calls didnt go through.Friends suggested I go home, which is just two hours from Nagercoil. At 5 pm, I left by a bus but reaching my hometown in Tirunelveli district took over three hours as fallen vegetation all along the route made the vehicle crawl.After reaching home, hunger got a whole new definition in my mind as I had the first piece of chappati of the day.On Friday morning after making a few calls, I realised some of my fellow reporters still hadnt had any food. My mother quickly prepared packets of chappati with tomato side dish and lemon rice, which has a longer shelf life.Reaching the city was again tedious but I somehow made it and shared the food with the hungry reporters. We were back at work. One dreadful and eventful day had passed.

5a539ee19855b770e0381704,State’s crops lose value; vegetable prices touch roof,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/2017/nov/22/states-crops-lose-value-vegetable-prices-touch-roof-1707381.html,2017-11-22,,The New Indian Express,"KOCHI: Its a double whammy for the Kerala economy and its farmers. The prices of the states leading crops - from pepper to cardamom, rubber to nutmeg and cocoa - are on a free fall while the prices of its vegetables, eggs, chicken, and fish, which Kerala depends on the neighbouring states, are shooting through the roof. Experts said the situation is alarming, and the way out of it is key policy changes by allowing farmers the freedom to bring in capital and technology to grow a fruit/vegetable he wants in vast areas of land.Right now, the rules allow only plantation crops, especially rubber, to be grown in over five acres of land, restricting farmers the freedom to farm crops that yield better returns. While pepper prices have fallen below Rs 400/kg compared to Rs 730-735/kg in the same period last year, cardamom prices have slipped to Rs 1,000/kg from Rs 1,500/ kg in May-June this year.Nutmeg prices declined from Rs 350/kg last year to Rs 200/kg while nutmeg flower prices have come down by Rs 1,350/kg to less than Rs 1000/kg in the same period. Clove prices fell from Rs 1050/kg to Rs 600/kg and cocoa from Rs 230-235 to Rs 160/kg. The only exception to this is coconut with prices ruling at Rs 30-35/piece, a two-year high, but low production means no big gains for farmers. In contrast, the prices of vegetables, which the state relies on neighbouring states, mostly Tamil Nadu, are skyrocketing.Small onion prices have gone up from Rs 40-50/kg to Rs 130/kg, tomatoes are ruling at Rs 60/kg, doubling from Rs 30/ kg some months ago, cabbage going up from Rs 18/kg to Rs 60/kg. Renny Jacob, group chairman of Kanjirappally-based Homegrown Biotech, which is engaged in research, cultivation, and development of exotic varieties of tropic fruit trees, says the legal framework of the state is anti-farmer. You cant force anyone to farm rubber. But, the rules are doing exactly that, Renny, who sees immense potential for growing exotic fruits such as rambutan in his farm, says."
