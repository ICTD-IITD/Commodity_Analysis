Picture by Ashwinee Pati Bhubaneswar, Aug. 8: The state government today expressed its helplessness to contain the price of onion, which is now selling at Rs 30 a kg. ""The state produces only one-fourth of its onion requirement. Whatever onion has been produced this year in the state has been exhausted. Now, we are depending on other states such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh,"" food supplies and consumer welfare minister Surya Narayan Patro told The Telegraph. The government had announced on August 2 that it would make onion available at select outlets at Rs 17 a kg and had even threatened to take action against hoarders. It had said that the sellers should not charge more than Re 1 above the purchase price. ""There has been crop failure in Madhya Pradesh, while the crop has not been harvested in Andhra Pradesh. So it is not just Odisha, the entire country is depending on Maharashra at the moment. This crisis is not specific to Odisha. The entire country is facing the problem. At some places, onion is selling at Rs 35 a kg,"" said Patro. The minisyer said the purchase price at the source point was now between Rs 26,000 and Rs 27,000 a quintal. ""After taking the transport cost into account, the selling price in Odisha comes to around Rs 30 per kg,"" he said, adding that he had asked his department officials to sell onion at the government outlets at a price not above Rs 30 a kg. The rise in onion prices following the soaring price of tomato has hit the consumers hard. Last week, tomato was selling at between Rs 80 and Rs 100 a kg in the retail market. ""We have no role to play in the rise in onion price. The price of onion has increased at the source points,"" said secretary of Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda. Traders apprehend that the current high prices would continue till November. ""The winter crop from Nashik will reach the state in November. Besides, onions grown in various parts of the state will also enter the market in the winter and only then will the price stabilise,"" said Panda. Both farmers and traders said the state was suffering because of the lack of adequate cold storages. The state had witnessed distress sale of onions in March. However, the state government had attributed distress sale to over-production."

With Bakrid preceding Thiruvonam by two days, on September 1, the trade fairs too began slightly earlier this year, aimed at tapping into the demand of the twin celebrations. ""At a time when the prices of essential commodities are increasing in the general market, the trade fairs really are a boon to the common man; they could aptly be termed 'the people's market',"" said K V Thomas MP, speaking after launching the Onam Trade Fair set up by Supplyco on the Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium premises in Kaloor.Thomas said agencies like Supplyco play a key role in preventing the price hike of essential goods. ""There was a time when wholesale traders use to collect goods from FCI warehouses. But most of them would in turn keep the stock in their own godowns, resulting in increasing number of cases related with the hoarding of goods. They later sell these goods in the black market. This prompted the then government to introduce the Food Safety Bill.This helped government agencies like Supplyco play a major role in providing supplies to the common man,"" said Thomas. The MP said the government is taking a favourable stance towards Supplyco godowns. ""Supplyco should use these favourable conditions for the benefit of consumers,"" said Thomas. ""A new programme named Karshakamithram, mooted to attract more students towards agriculture, will be launched in schools soon. One lakh curry leaf saplings will be distributed on September 11.""THE HIGHS AND LOWS OF ONAMKochi: Every year, the weeks leading up to Onam season are marked by the soaring prices of vegetables. This year, with only about a two week-countdown left for the festival, it is not easy to assess the price trend in the market. Some of the essential vegetables are priced high, but the prices of others, which hit an all time high last month, have come down. For instance, the price of shallots saw a record high price of D140 per kg in July. This month, however, it has come down to D85 per kg. The main reason for the price hike in shallots was the drought in Tamil Nadu from where the produce reaches Kerala. Now, the wholesalers are getting more supply from Andhra Pradesh which is reflected in the reduced price, said N Rajan, a vendor in Kaloor market.However, customers complain vegetables sold cheaply in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka become costly when they cross the border into Kerala. The price increases three or four fold when it reaches here, said Prasanth Jacob, a customer. Raw banana costs only D30 per kg in Coimbatore. However, a customer here has to pay a minimum of D70. Likewise, tomato which is available for D15 per kg in Tamil Nadu gets a weightier price tag here, costing D60 to D70 per kg. The other items that witness a hike in price in August are beetroot, amaranthus, beans, cow pea and drumstick. The price of green chilly and carrot have reduced slightly. ""The prices were fluctuating during the first two weeks of August. However, it is likely to go up by the end of this month, added Rajan.The where and when of fairsSupplyco fairs will be organised in all taluks in Ernakulam. Essential commodities, including red chilly, coriander, black beans, bengal gram, tur dal and vegetables will be available at prices lower than the market price. The trade fairs will function from August 20 to September 3, a day ahead of Thiruvonam. ""There will be special festival offers and gift coupons for consumers,"" said marketing manager R N Satheesh. Every customer making purchases of more than Rs 2,000 will be issued a gift coupon for a lucky draw. The first prize winner will get one sovereign gold, while the state-level winner will get five sovereigns of gold. The vegetable stall at Supplyco fair is set up by Vegetable and Fruits Promotion Council of Kerala. Vegetables like carrot, potato and cabbage are brought from Kanthalloor, Vattavada and Munnar. The special programme 'Onathinu Oru Muram Pachakkari', an homegrown, organic vegetable initiative, was also launched in Ernakulam today.Daily marketprice- Retail(August 21)Source: VFPCK.Price in Rs per KgAmaranthus: B23Banana nenthran: B58Banana (njalipoovan): B80Beetroot: B48Bittergourd: B50Brinjal (long): B38Carrot: B48Cowpea: B58Onion: B32Shallot: B85Tomato: B56Snake gourd: B40Beans: B55At a time when the prices of essential commodities are increasing in the general market, the trade fairs really are a boon to the common man; they could aptly be termed 'the people's market'K V Thomas, MPEvery customer making purchases of more than Rs 2,000 will be issued a gift coupon for a lucky draw.

5a114d669855b76bf13df340,A desi take-off,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2017/aug/29/a-desi-take-off-1649369.html,2017-08-29,"KOCHI: It has been established countless times that the road to a persons heart is through his or her stomach. And it seems the airline companies have finally understood this universal truth.All the companies are scrambling their menu cards to provide their customers with the ultimate food experience as they fly towards their destinations. The cuisine being offered range from the oriental, continental etc to the local flavours.Among the airlines, Kochi-headquartered Air India Express has gone the extra mile and are giving their passengers the choicest of Malabar food, mainly Malabari poratta and chicken curry from their customised ala carte.Air India Express claims they are the only company in the country which serves complimentary snacks, both the veg and non-veg variety, in the domestic and international routes.We have added varieties like Malabar chicken, meen vattichathu, poratta and chicken to our lunch and dinner menus. These dishes can be ordered only online up to 24 hours prior to the departure of the flight. Bar snacks and starters such as chicken tangri kebab with mint chutney, chicken 65 and chicken nuggets with tomato ketchup rosemary chicken with caramelized onion in multi cereal roll and jeera rice served alongside butter paneer and aloo gobi with salad and gulab jamun are potential enough to tickle the taste buds of passengers, said the spokesperson of the AIE.AIEs inclusion of non-vegetarian dishes in its menu assumes significance considering the fact that Air India, the parent company of AIE, had recently discontinued the supply of these dishes in the economy class its domestic flights as part of cost cutting. The national carrier had also been in news a couple of times for mixing up veg and non-veg orders.According to a report tabled in the Parliament by the Civil Aviation Ministry officials, Air India had mixed up orders three times. Also, the airline had received as many as 44, 27 and 48 complaints in the last three years, regarding the quality of food and catering service. The multiple complaints forced the airline to take appropriate action against the caterer as per the contractual terms.Cost cutting measuresAir India stopped serving non-vegetarian meals in the economy class of its domestic flights as part of cost cutting measures. It also launched various cost cutting measures like a change in menu, meal schedule, rationalisation of dry stores and ancillary items as per current trends.The annual savings which are expected to be made from these measures is Rs 20 crore, said the officials while replying to a query. The annual savings from the discontinuation of non-vegetarian meals in the economy class of Air India domestic flights are expected to be around Rs 8 to Rs 10 crore, said Ministry. Apart from saving cost, it will reduce wastage, improve service and also prevent any chances of mix-ups.This doesnt mean the national carrier is dragging its feet in improvising the airline menu. The airline company has taken steps to improve its catering services by introducing new improved menu, doing away with food items not preferred by passengers, has began training chefs at its international stations on Indian cuisine, taking up passenger and crew feedbacks with the caterers aggressively and monitoring the quality or presentation of meal service closely and making surprise visits to the caterers often. Further, follow ups will be taken for rectifications if a deficiency in the caterers service is noticed, said officials.Local flavours a hitAround 95 per cent of air passengers from Kerala prefer to have local dishes onboard, said Gunasekaran Chandrasekaran, chief chef with Casino Air-caterers and Flight Services, Kochi.Today airlines are putting more emphasis on including as many deshi dishes as possible in their menu. And there has been a good feedback regarding the local cuisine. We have received orders from three major airlines to provide special Onam dishes for its flights to Kerala, he said.Though he refused to disclose the dishes since the airlines are planning the menu as a surprise for their passengers, a senior AIE officer said those flying with Air India Express will be greeted with a special Kerala sweet dish onboard the flight.Experts associated with the flight kitchens also maintain there has been a considerable increase in foreigners who visit the state and nearly all of them prefer to savour the best of the local flavour."
5a1150e19855b76bf13df594,Congress lines up oil 'loot' protests,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170916/jsp/nation/story_173499.jsp,2017-09-16,"New Delhi, Sept. 15: The Congress has lined up a nationwide campaign against rising prices of petroleum products and food items, accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of squeezing money out of the common man's pocket to fill up government coffers. While there will be a demonstration at Jantar Mantar in Delhi on September 20, at least 10 lakh signatures will be collected for a memorandum to be submitted to the Prime Minister. The signatures will be collected from people at petrol pumps for three days from Sunday. All Congress state units have been asked to devise their own programmes against the rising prices of petroleum products and food items like onions, tomatoes, some pulses and other vegetables. While onion and tomato prices have shot past Rs 50 a kg, some pulses are selling at over Rs 100 per kg even as arhar prices crashed after crossing Rs 200 last year. Congress leader Ajay Maken said at a news conference today: ""If petrol or food items sell at higher prices because of unavoidable circumstances, we can understand. But this government indulges in profiteering by looting ordinary citizens. Petroleum products are a case in point. The domestic prices have soared as international crude oil rates have gone down."" Maken added: ""While the government has given absurd reasons like 'Hurricane Harvey and Irma' for the increase in petrol and diesel prices, it has dealt a devastating blow to the savings of the common people by increasing central excise 11 times in the past three and a half years - 133.47% on petrol and 400.86% on diesel. The government has also robbed 18.11 crore LPG consumers by increasing the prices of subsidised cylinders by Rs 75 in the past three years."" Pointing out that international crude oil prices have come down more than 52 per cent since the Modi government took over on May 26, 2014, Maken said: ""If you take petrol of Rs 100, Rs 51.78 is going to the government in the form of taxes. In diesel worth Rs 100, Rs 44.40 is tax. This is dacoity. Which government punishes citizens to make up for its own (revenue) shortfall caused by wrong economic policies? This is not only insensitive, this is loot."" Maken declared that the Congress ""shall fight this battle to reduce taxes on every available forum"". ""We dare the BJP to come out with a white paper on taxes on fuel and the total gains. The Congress demands immediate withdrawal of excessive central excise duties and other taxes."" Maken stressed that the government had adopted a devious strategy to mislead people by raising prices in small instalments. ""18.11 crore customers purchase subsidised gas cylinders every month. The government decided to increase the price of every cylinder by Rs 4 every month until the subsidy is wiped out. In the last three years, the hike on a gas cylinder was Rs 75. This is done when international price is so low. The UPA government was paying a subsidy of Rs 449 per cylinder to provide relief to the common citizen."""

A long break in rain has heightened prospects of soya crop failure and portends a big trouble for farmers reeling under heavy debt.In past one year, they faced back to back losses, notwithstanding bumper crops of orange and onion. Post-demonetisation, onion was sold for Re 1 before the government stepped in. ""The government woke up too late and started procuring onion at a rate of Rs 8 per kg. By the time the procurement started, thousands of farmers had already sold lakhs of tonnes of onion,"" said farmers in Agar Malwa bitterly.""It should rain soon or the soya crop may damage,"" they said. The district in western MP is known for producing good quality orange, onion and soyabean. Grown over almost 50,000 acres of land, orange crop was hit by demonetisation when traders did not turn up to buy the produce. Availability of onion at dirt cheap rate dealt another blow to growers.Poor rain in the district led to stunted growth of the soya crop. This is happening when many farmers are under debtfrom Rs 1 to Rs3 lakhdepending on the land area under cultivation.A farmer, Roop Narayan is trying hard to save his soya crop. Narayan, who sowed soya between rows of orange plants on 10 bighas of land, says, ""I incurred a loss of Rs 1.5 lakh after spending Rs 3 lakh on onion crop. I had no other option, but to borrow more money from the cooperative societies. I am just praying nothing goes wrong this time.""He said the government should have ""reacted early"" to procure onions from farmers. The decision was taken after more than 15 days, he said. Another farmer Devi Singh could get barely Rs 90,000 by selling onion at Rs 2/ kg. He said the government, which talks a lot about the farmers, should actually do something concrete for them.Jain Singh, another farmer of the region, says, ""We need warehouses for onion and yields like tomato and orange cultivated in the region.""Minister for agriculture Gaurishankar Bisen, however, said, "" Onion procurement benefited 99% farmers. The government also procured urad and moong from farmers. We will always be around to help farmers."""

However, there was disinflation in the food basket.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which factors in CPI for arriving at its monetary policy, had earlier this month slashed the key interest rate (repo rate) by 25 basis points to 6%.Separately, skyrocketing tomato prices propelled inflation at the wholesale level to 1.88% in July from 0.9% in June, with the food category overall contributing significantly to the uptick in WPI terms.Inflation in the food segment of the primary articles category in July came in at 2.15%, snapping a two-month contraction. Within this, the fruits and vegetables segment contributed the most, with inflation coming in at 29%.Seasonal, temporaryTomatoes witnessed blistering inflation of more than 209% in July, compared with a contraction of 29.4% in June, according to data with the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). Brinjal, too, witnessed a sharp acceleration in inflation to 21.1% in July, from the previous months contraction of 3.1%. Okra ( Bhindi ) saw inflation at 32.4%.What we have to recognise is that these are seasonal influences and are therefore temporary in nature, D.K. Srivastava, chief policy advisor at EY India, said. We must look at core WPI inflation and see if there are any factors pushing it up. Otherwise, this increase will subside shortly. As far as fuel is concerned, there has not been any significant movement in crude oil prices, so that wouldnt put any pressure in either direction, Mr. Srivastava said.The index for Food Articles group rose by 6.2%... due to higher price of fruits and vegetables (29%), peas/chawali (6%), ragi (4%) and condiments & spices, barley, poultry chicken and paddy (1% each), the government said in its release. Inflation in the minerals segment of the primary articles category accelerated to 24.8% in July from a contraction of 2.02% while manufactured products saw a marginally lower 2.18% compared with Junes 2.27%, marking the sixth month of slowing inflation in the segment.Wholesale-based prices have edged up in the month of July on back of sharp increase noted in vegetable prices, Pankaj Patel, president, FICCI, said in an email.However, the broad conditions for agri prices remain conducive.( With inputs from Sharad Raghavan in New Delhi )"

Road, in Malleswaram and other areas.The KSPCB had first banned PoP idols and their immersion in waterbodies in 2014. The ban was reintroduced in 2016, but stating a delay in communication, idol makers approached KSPCB with a plea to permit sale of idols that had already been manufactured. The KSPCB temporarily relaxed the ban on the condition that the idols be scientifically disposed. It reiterated that a complete ban would come into effect this year.Lakshman, chairman, KSPCB, told The Hindu , The board had directed the BBMP and other municipal corporations to ensure that the ban is followed in letter and spirit. It is their responsibility to ensure enforcement by conducting raids and inspections. But this was not done. If the direction is not followed, KSPCB will take appropriate action against the bodies.Stating that the authorities concerned have not done much to enforce the ban, N.S. Ramakanth, member, Solid Waste Management Expert Committee, BBMP, said, The KSPCB has conducted half a dozen meetings in this regard, but has not been able to achieve anything. As citizen representatives, we recommended placing boards at waterbodies stating that immersion of PoP idols will not be allowed. Except near Yediyur lake, this has not been done anywhere else. With PoP idols already making it to the markets, we foresee lake pollution this year as well.An eco-friendly messageAround 150 civic leaders trained by Bangalore Political Action Committee (B.PAC) have been conducting awareness programmes in their respective neighbourhoods. Apart from this, we are conducting make your own clay Ganesh workshops in 20 wards. We have already covered 11 wards, including B.T.M. Layout, Koramangala, Shanthinagar, K.R. Puram, and made around 2,500 clay idols. In the next two days, we will be covering the remaining wards, said Sushma Mahabala, programme head, B.PAC, which has roped in artists from Karnataka Chitrakala Parishad to conduct the workshop.From Ganesh to a plantA Ganesh that grows into a plant remains a popular eco-friendly innovation. Sasya Ganapathi, a company started by four friends this year, has created and sold 1,000 such Ganeshs.Ganesh Chathurti is something that most people celebrate. We thought we could spread a green message through the festival. Thus was born Sasya Ganapathi, says co-founder Bharath Srinivas.The kit includes a 1 ft clay Ganesh idol, which is filled with fertiliser and a potting mix. Pot and seeds are provided separately.After the festival, people can immerse the idol in the pot. When it dissolves, the fertiliser mixes with the soil, following which seeds can be added. We offer tulsi, ladies finger and tomato seeds, said Mr. Srinivas. A year of experimenting preceded the launch of the product.Another start-up  GrowShareSustain  has come out with a similar concept where a clay Ganesh idol is a seed ball. After the festival, the idol can be immersed in a container. As the idol dissolves, the seed balls merge into the clay and soil. With enough sunlight and water, saplings will sprout within a week."

First, he bought one acre of land to augment his familys 0.75 acres (30 guntas) in Sanganakeri village of Gokak taluk in Belagavi district, and then chose an elite variety of tomato, the Arka Rakshak, to cultivate.The young man, who was ridiculed by seasoned farmers for chasing his dream, is now a household name. He made nearly Rs. 10 lakh in four months. I have harvested a bumper yield of 43 tonnes and am expecting another 8 to 10 tonnes from the remaining crop, which is a record in this region, says Mr. Sunil, whose mantra in farming is determination and application of scientific practices.In honour of his success the Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR) organised a field demonstration day at his farm to popularise scientific methods of cultivation of this high-yielding variety.IIHRs Vegetable Division Head A.T. Sadashiva, who headed the team of scientists that developed the Arka Rakshak, says this variety has resistance to three major diseases besides having a long shelf-life. He also believes this variety, which yields 18 kg a plant, can bring financial stability to small and marginal farmers. Mr. Sunil is now doling out advice to farmers from different parts of the State who call him up to learn about his experiences. I feel extremely happy that some of the farmers who used to think that small farms are not profitable are having a rethink after my experience, he says."
