I can imagine what her dining table would look like  laden with some of the best known dishes of Bengal, from fish and mutton preparations, to fries and cutlets, stuffed vegetables and chutneys.Being a card-holding feminist  let me remind new readers that I protested in front of a Miss India pageant many years ago  I do not belong to that school of thought which states that the best chefs are always men. Though some of my best friends are men who cook, and rather well, I hold with high regard women who have been cooking delicious stuff  and writing about it, too. Consider all these names from Bengal  Bunny Gupta, Jaya Chaliha, Minakshie Das Gupta, Chitrita Banerjee, Satarupa Banerjee. I rely on their books whenever I want to try out something interesting from Bengal.And now I think I need to get some recipes out of Iti Aunty, who is based in Kolkata and is known to wield a mean ladle. I had a special thaala  thats thaali in Bengali  curated by her at the Monkey Bar the other evening, and have been licking my fingers ever since. The festival  on from tomorrow (September 24) to September 30  is a Puja special that also seeks to celebrate what is called pate puja in Bengal, or worshipping the stomach.I am, as you know, very fond of the Monkey Bar. The CP outlet has shut down, but the one in the Vasant Kunj Market is so full of life that I feel years younger whenever I am there. Theres loud music, no doubt, but the lights that glitter from funky chandeliers, the great menu and the friendly staff all make for a very happy meal.And I had a very, very happy meal when I was invited to try out Iti Auntys Pujor Special Thaala. There are three kinds of platters on offer  with fish (Rs. 1299 plus taxes), with chicken (Rs. 1199 plus taxes), and vegetarian (Rs. 999 plus taxes). Every thaala has in common aloor dom, a Bengali variation of dum aloo, flavoured with cumin and other spices, begun kasundi, which is an eggplant dish with a sharp mustard flavour, plastic chutney, cooked with raw papayas, and tomato chutney.I opted for the fish thhaala which also included fish kachori, bhoona khichri with fried mourola fish, steamed prawns wrapped in pumpkin leaves, fish cutlet and kamala bhetki. Each one was delicious.The gravy in the kamala bhetki was lightly flavoured with oranges, so it was mildly sweet, as Bengali food can be. The prawns were sharp with mustard and the fish cutlet  with mashed boneless fish mixed with potato, crumbed and fried  was just right.I have had various kinds of kachoris, or Bengali kochuris, but the fish kochuri was one of a kind, with a filling of mashed bhetki. The kachori, soft and puffy like a puri, was absolutely superb. I enjoyed the khichri immensely, too. It had been cooked with the fragrant gobindo bhog rice and moong dal, flavoured with ghee and topped with fried onions and fried mourala fish.Mourala is a small fish that I think is best eaten when fried with just a coating of salt, chillies and turmeric. Here they had put a besan batter around the fish. The problem with the fish is that it has to be eaten fresh off the kadhai, because if kept out for a while, it goes limp in this weather.The kasundi  a strong and mildly bitter mustard sauce  gave the begun kasundi a nice kick and I happily finished off the plastic chutney  so called because of its light, translucent look.The chicken thaala includes mughlai porotas, flaky, fried bread that Calcutta is known for, bhoona khichuri with chicken meatballs, chicken chop, chicken kosha and omelette curry, which is a great Bengali favourite of omelette pieces in a light gravy.The vegetarian thaala has luchi, or maida puris, parwal stuffed with cottage cheese, dhokar dalna, steamed dal cakes in gravy, sukto, a light vegetable mix, mildly bitter and sweet, steamed rice, apart from the four common dishes.The platter didnt come with a sweet. I told Chef Himmat, the man on the spot, hed have a mini Bengali rebellion at hand if there was no dessert. I got a call yesterday to say that mishti doi has now been added to the platter  which I think is a great idea.This may sound corny, but I have just two words for the festival  De taali.Address: Plot No 11, Pocket C 6 & 7, Commercial Complex Vasant Kunj; Tel: 011 41095155; Open from noon to midnight (those under 25 years are only allowed till 6:00 pm)"

(Bishwarup Dutta)July 10: Tomato prices have almost doubled over the past two weeks as the stock produced in Bengal in winter is over and the state is depending on the supply from Karnataka.Tomatoes in Bengal are seasonal whereas in the southern state, it's almost throughout the year, a trader in Koley Market, the largest wholesale vegetable market in the city, said.Prices were lower when tomatoes were in abundance because of production in Bengal and supply from Karnataka.Now that the Bengal stock has depleted, the supply has dried up in retail markets across the city and the prices have shot up to Rs 80 a kg.Two weeks ago, tomatoes were selling at Rs 40 a kg, the trader said.""The rise in the prices is because of supply shortage. Fifteen trucks used to arrive in the market daily. Now, the number has dwindled to seven or eight,"" another trader said.At Koley Market, the wholesale prices are hovering between Rs 60 and Rs 64 a kg.Bengal produces tomatoes in winter and they are available in the market for a couple of months.""December-February is the production period in the state. The tomatoes are available till May or June,"" Chayan Kumar Dinda, a vegetable vendor at Lake Market, said.""After that we have to depend on tomatoes coming from Karnataka,"" he said.Dinda said he had been selling tomatoes at Rs 80 a kg for the past one week.But the prices will not remain high for long, a retailer said. Once the tomatoes from Nashik in Maharashtra start reaching the city, the prices will come down, he said.""Once the tomatoes from Nashik arrive, around August, tomato prices will drop again. The spike happens every year around this time,"" Rabindranath Koley, general secretary of the forum of traders' organisation, Bengal, said.About a decade ago, tomatoes were available only in winter, Koley said. But better transport and storage facilities have ensured tomatoes are now available in markets throughout the year, he said."

Wadood, who is professor of agro-meteorology and environment science at Birsa Agricultural University, on rising prices of tomato and the progress of the monsoonTT: Tomatoes prices have shot up, but not of other vegetables. Why?AW: The local tomato growing season is coming to an end. Supply is dwindling leading to price riseIs it true that the quality of local tomato is inferior?Yes. It is inferior because of its seed quality. If farmers choose better quality seeds and take care of other farming aspects, the quality will surely be betterHow helpful has the monsoon been for farming so far?The monsoon was initially week due to western disturbances, but picked up later. Now, the atmosphere has good moisture content and is favourable for showingCan we expect a good crop this year?For that, the rains need to continue. Transplantation, particularly in low land, needs water. I hope it rains well the years prediction is 96 per cent average rainfallWill we surpass last years production figures?That depends on the progress of the monsoon. Last year was good with 1,456 mm rainfall. The total production of paddy was over 50 lakh tonneYou deal with agro-meteorologyYes, agro-meteorology is the study of the impact of various weather parameters like temperature, rainfall, humidity, cloud cover, moisture and evaporation on agriculture. The idea is to use the information to enhance crop productionHow does it help farmers?It is a part of the Centres Grameen Krishi Mousam Seva run by the Indian Meteorological Department. It issues forecast and farm advisories through bulletins every Tuesday and FridayHow helpful are the bulletins?Farmers get advance information about the weather.

Picture by Uttam Kumar Pal Naveen gesture NCC cadets take part in a tent pitching competition during a training camp in Rourkela. Picture by Uttam Kumar PalnArch-rivals BJD and BJP welcomed the NDAs presidential candidate Ram Nath Kovind in Bhubaneswar on Friday. However the BJD, despite its support for Kovind, sought to maintain a distance from the BJP and interacted with the NDAs nominee separately at the conference hall in the Assembly. Nevertheless, when it came to the photo session, chief minister Naveen Patnaik held and raised the hand of not only Kovind, but also J.P. Nadda, Union minister and senior BJP leader who had accompanied the former. Though some BJD leaders might have frowned at this, it was widely seen as a gesture of courtesy that drew praise. Predator mess Forest and environment minister Bijayshree Routray is said to be unhappy with his officers, who are yet to catch the animal attacking sheep at Niali and in other areas of the state. Aware of the rising public anger against the authorities on the issue, he is learnt to have given the top mandarins of the department a piece of his mind, but they appear to be helpless. We have stepped up our vigil at Niali and in other areas, where the attacks have taken place. We can catch the predator if it is sighted. When no one has seen it properly, how can we hope to trap it? said a hassled forest officer on duty at Niali. Too costly Tomato prices have gone through the roof leaving consumers in a tight spot. They are fuming at the governments alleged insensitivity with neither agriculture minister nor the food supplies and consumer welfare minister coming to their rescue. While agriculture minister Damodar Rout washed his hands off the price rise blaming it on lack of marketing facilities which, he said, did not fall within his departments purview, food supplies minister Surya Narayan Patro has sought to downplay the issue describing tomato as a non-essential commodity and the price rise a nationwide phenomenon. They dont realise how it has affected the middle class with tomato prices soaring to Rs 80 a kilo from Rs 8 a kilo a month ago, said a homemaker. Open secret Though now it is more than obvious that UPA presidential nominee Meira Kumars visit to Bhubaneswar to meet state Congress MLAs was cancelled because of the continuing tug of war between the Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee (OPCC) and the Congress Legislature Party, some party leaders have sought to make light of it. Party chief whip Tara Prasad Bahinipati, who shares a strained relationship with OPCC president Prasad Harichandan, raised many eyebrows when he described Kumars visit as unnecessary because party MLAs were going to vote for her anyway. Its true that party legislators will vote for her but we all know what scuttled her visit, said a senior Congress leader. Lonely leader Former minister Bimbadhar Kuanr, who had ended his old ties with the BJP to join the BJD three years ago, seems to be ploughing a lonely furrow in his adopted party. If sources close to the leader are to be believed, the veteran from west Odisha, who had held many important positions during his time with the BJP, is hardly ever seen in programmes organised by the ruling party.However, since he had quit the saffron outfit accusing its leadership of ignoring him, he will find it hard to make a comeback. Besides there has to be some excuse for going back. At the moment he cant think of anything, said a sympathiser of the beleaguered leader. FOOTNOTE Damodar Rout Back in the game Criticism of his rather loose tongue notwithstanding, agriculture minister Damodar Rout continues to enjoy the confidence of chief minister Naveen Patnaik. In fact, he seems to be having a great run of luck. During Naveens last ministry rejig, he benefited the most by bagging the plum agriculture portfolio coveted by many colleagues. His importance within the ministry has also gone up with him being allotted the seat next to Naveen in the Assembly. Critics had written him off. But he has proved all of them wrong, said a BJD leader. Ashutosh Mishra"
5a1466b39855b76bf13e3e96,A tale of the flying tomato,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170717/jsp/jharkhand/story_162279.jsp,2017-07-17,"The story of the tomato is one of rags-to-riches in Ranchi. Farmers had been forced to destroy tonnes of this edible fruit - rich in the healthy antioxidant pigment lycopene - in January this year when the supply-demand mismatch dragged down prices to as low as Rs 2 a kilo. By mid-July, the tomato is back with a bang - a rare relish with a premium tag of Rs 100 a kg. President of Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FJCCI) Vinay Kumar Agrawal blamed the monsoon for the abnormal rise in tomato price. ""Increase in rates is not unusual in the rainy season because local farmers depend on import from Bangalore and Nasik. And this year, the supply is also poor; hence, the price is hitting the roof. There will be no relief till the end of monsoon (September),"" he said. It goes without saying that homemakers in the state capital are grappling with their kitchen budget. Pinky Sharma of Upper Bazaar quipped that a curry with tomatoes had become a status symbol. ""I was buying half a kilo for Rs 50 from a vendor and people were looking at me as if I were some maharani (queen). It gave me such complex that I settled for 250gm,"" she chortled. Saraswati Devi, who works at a computer accessories store, said she had switched to bottled ketchup. ""I noticed the price skyrocketing last (Saturday) evening and decided to shift allegiance. While a kilo of raw tomatoes was being sold at Rs 80-100 per kg, a 1kg bottle of ketchup is available at Rs 100-130. The latter is cost-effective because it lasts longer,"" she added. Madhvi Mishra, a resident of Vidyapati Nagar, recalled how an acquaintance had to deal with his 12-year-old daughter's tantrums because he did not buy tomatoes for her birthday party. ""The little girl loves the tangy taste of homemade sauce and couldn't come to terms with the fact that there were no tomatoes on her birthday menu,"" Mishra said. On January 30 this year, farmers of Bundu, protesting against the dearth of cold storage facilities and food processing plants, had destroyed tonnes of tomatoes. Similar protests had taken place at many other places on the outskirts of the capital. Farmer Keshwar Sahu on Sunday said a proper storage and supply plan could alone put a check on abnormal pricing of perishable items. ""Otherwise, the story will be same every year. Tomatoes will sometimes be down to earth, literally, as it happened a few months ago; and sometimes they will be too pricey for consumption like now,"" he summed up.

Telegraph pictureThe Rs 100 price tag for a kilo of tomatoes and resultant public outcry made state food and public distribution department sit up on Monday to ask vegetable wholesale dealers to stabilise prices.This directive was given by department secretary Vinay Kumar Choubey at a meeting with Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce & Industries (FJCCI) president Vinay Kumar Agrawal and his deputy Kunal Ajmani, among others, and Pandra Bazar Samiti members on Monday evening. Pandra Bazar is Ranchi's wholesale hub.""I have asked them to ensure that retail price of tomato should stay between Rs 75 and Rs 80 kg a kilo and not exceed in any case. FJCCI and Pandra Bazar Samiti have promised to stabilise prices,"" Choubey said, adding he acted on the basis of newspaper reports.Trade representatives told Choubey that currently they imported tomato from Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Nepal where wholesale prices fluctuate between Rs 50 and Rs 55 a kilo. Ranchi wholesalers buy tomato between Rs 60 and Rs 65 and, keeping a profit margin, sell it to retailers who again repeat the process with their customers.A rabi crop, tomato is produced in Jharkhand in huge quantities but the local crop ends latest by June after which it is imported. As tomato is perishable, it can't be cold-stored for long. At least eight to 10 per cent of stocks imported rot and price goes up at each point, traders told Choubey.""Their concerns may be valid,"" Choubey said. ""The government is not forcing traders to suffer loss. But they should not indulge in profiteering."""
5a146c4a9855b76bf13e42cd,Tomato prices skyrocket,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170720/jsp/odisha/story_162769.jsp,2017-07-20,"Vendors sell tomatoes at the Unit-I market in Bhubaneswar. Picture by Ashwinee PatiTomato prices have soared in the past month, from Rs 25 per kilogram to Rs 100-Rs 110 per kilogram in Bhubaneswar. Lelin Mallick of The Telegraph speaks to traders, residents, and experts to find out the rationale behind the price rise The problem Tomato was being sold at Rs 25 a kilogram in various city markets just a month ago. The state's tomato farmers resorted to agitation in March and dumped quintals of the fruit on the roads to protest against distress sale. The price of the crop had even dipped to Re 1 per kilogram in Keonjhar, Angul and Bargarh during the summer, spurring the Opposition Congress and the BJP to demonstrate against the government. Reason behind the price rise The city is dependant on Karnataka for supply tomato with 20 trucks arriving daily. It has come down to three to four trucks over the past few days. Traders said the city's daily requirement was 100 tonnes of tomato, the supply of which has come down by almost 80 per cent. Traders fear that the price would touch Rs 100 in a couple of days. The city is reliant on Bengal, Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh for the crop. Low yield in Bengal led to a stop in tomato imports to the city. Besides, fresh crop from Karnataka reaches the city in a week. Traders said the state capital never depended on locally grown tomato during monsoon. Price difference The wholesale price of the fruit is Rs 60 per kilogram but when it reaches the retailers, the price rises by Rs 20 (around 30 per cent). Traders attributed the difference to the crop's perishable nature. They also said the crop couldn't be stored for long. Improvement likely Traders said the situation was likely to improve in a week or two. ""We have to wait for fresh produce, either from Karnataka or Himachal Pradesh, which may take another one to two weeks,"" said secretary of the Raw Vegetable Merchants' Association, Kabiraj Swain. State's role The state government attributed sale of tomato at throwaway prices in various districts to over production of the crop. But it had failed to set up adequate cold storages to store tomato, which has been witnessing frequent price rise along with onion. Public opinion ""The crop used to be sold at cheaper rates in the summer, but the state government failed to arrange proper facility to store the crop. If the government had managed to store the crop properly, the price might not have skyrocketed during the rains. Tomato has become a luxury even for the middle class,"" said Deepak Panigrahi, a sales executive and resident of Bhubaneswar."
5a1474bb9855b76bf13e4592,...tomato prices shoot up,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170727/jsp/calcutta/story_164075.jsp,2017-07-27,"July 26: Rs 40 a kilo in late June, Rs 80 in early July and now a new high of Rs 120. The price of tomato is shooting up faster than the Sensex. The buzz in the markets is that a dip in production across the country has led to a shortfall in supply, coinciding with the season when local produce is not available. The price of tomato has increased by almost Rs 40 a kilo in the Maniktala market since Metro first highlighted the upswing on July 11. The produce currently available in Calcutta markets is mostly from Karnataka. Tomato becomes dearer between late June and early or mid-August, when the city becomes dependent on supplies from Karnataka. The markets are flooded with produce from within Bengal for around five months before that. Several retailers said the price rise this year was abnormal. College teacher Debayan Basu, who lives in Maniktala, bought tomato for Rs 120 a kilo last week. ""I do not remember when I last paid so much for this vegetable,"" he said. Compared to Maniktala, the price of a kilo of tomato is at present lower in New Market (Rs 80) and Lake Market (Rs 90). Abhijit Kumar Nandi, head of the department of agricultural economics at Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswa Vidyalaya, linked the abnormal price rise to less than normal production in the last crop year (July to June). ""During the 2015-16 crop year, tomato production in India was very good, because of which farmers did not get the price they expected,"" he said. After taking a price hit in the 2015-16 crop year, wary farmers apparently scaled down production in the subsequent year, which meant less supply to markets like Bengal. ""The total area under tomato cultivation was smaller in 2016-17 because farmers did not want a rerun of 2015-16. They preferred growing other crops instead. They feared that they may again incur losses if supply of tomatoes is higher than demand,"" Nandi said. The second factor in the price rise is that produce from Bengal has long disappeared from the markets. Tomato is grown in the state in winter. During that period, the price of the vegetable plummets because of abundant supply. Besides farmers reducing the area of cultivation, climatic conditions have had a role to play in the quantity of production this year. Tomato being essentially a cold crop, the shortening of winter is having an effect on productivity."

(Hardeep Singh) A week after the state food and civil supplies department directed traders to fix the retail price of tomato between Rs 75 and Rs 80 per kg, residents in Ranchi are continuing to pay anything between Rs 100 and Rs 120 a kilo. Homemakers rue that the rates are fluctuating from not just market to market, but from vendor to vendor. While Saraswati Singh of Piska More was lucky to purchase tomatoes for Rs 60 per kg at Naga Baba vegetable market on Tuesday, Babita Sharma of Upper Bazaar had had to pay an additional Rs 20 at the same market a day before. ""It is so confusing and unfair. Retailers are fleecing customers because there is no one to govern prices,"" said Babita. Surabhi Sinha, another resident of Piska More, and Nisha Singh of Booty More sounded equally annoyed. ""Last (Monday) night, I bought a kilo of tomato for Rs 120. When I told the shopkeeper about the government directive on retail price, he asked me to find another vendor if I wanted a better rate,"" said Surabhi. Nisha said few people had the time and energy to hop markets for a reasonable price. ""We are suffering because the government hasn't implemented its order."" The vegetable market at Sector-II in Dhurwa seemed to be the most reasonable one. Rajni, a local resident, said she struck gold at Rs 60 per kg. Sudama Sahu, a farmer who sells vegetables on Kanke Road, admitted that the price of tomato hadn't stabilised. ""Vendors in posh areas like Ashoknagar and Morabadi are charging more,"" he said. Jharkhand imports its tomato stocks from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Madan Prasad, a wholesaler at Pandra Bazar Samiti, said the wholesale price was between Rs 45 and Rs 50. ""Retail price shouldn't be more than Rs 70 in that case, but vendors are fleecing people,"" he added. Minister Saryu Roy, who had ordered the tomato price cap on July 24, said he was unaware of any variation. ""If any individual vendor is ignoring the government directive, he or she will face the music,"" Roy promised."
5a147b689855b76bf13e4a89,Govt fixes onion prices,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170803/jsp/odisha/story_165237.jsp,2017-08-03,"An onion shop at Unit-I Market in Bhubaneswar. Picture by Ashwinee Pati Bhubaneswar, Aug. 2: The state government today resorted to market intervention by fixing the price limit for onion, which is now selling at Rs 25 a kg in retail market. Food supplies and consumer welfare minister Surya Narayan Patro today asked the traders to sell onion within Rs 17 per kg and warned stern action in case of hoarding the commodity. Patro said the department had been instructed to keep close watch over the price situation. Officials will purchase onion from the source and sell it at fair price shops of the government named as ""Maitree"" at reasonable price. In the first phase, it will be sold in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack. The department has been asked to keep a token of Re 1 profit margin per kg and sell it to make the retail price affordable for the consumers. However, consumers have been left high and dry as onion price is now selling in the city at Rs 25 per kg. The price of onion was Rs 15 per kg early last week. The rise in onion price following the soaring of tomato price has hit the consumers hard. Last week, tomato was selling at Rs 100 per kg in retail market. The state needs nearly five lakh tonnes of onion annually of which it produces nearly three to 3.5 lakh tonnes. Odisha produces onions mainly in Kalahandi, Balangir, Boudh and Angul districts as well as a few areas in the state's western districts. Odisha depends mainly on Maharshtra, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh for procurement of onions. Wholesalers said the recent floods in Nashik and crop loss in Andhra Pradesh had led to the price rise. ""The price of onion has increased at source points. The city is getting the normal supply of 10 to 15 trucks of onion on daily basis, but as the price has increased in the procurement areas, it has its impact in the state as well,"" said Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha secretary Sudhakar Panda. Traders apprehend that the current price would prevail till November. ""The winter crop from Nashik will reach the state in November. Besides, onions grown in various parts of the state will also enter the market in the winter and then the price will stabilise,"" said Panda. Farmers and traders said the state was suffering because of lack of adequate number of cold storages. The state had witnessed distress sale of onions in March. However, the state government had attributed distress sale to the over-production of the crop. ""However, the state government is yet to come up with adequate cold storages to ease the problem,"" said Abhiram Jena, a farmer. On the other hand, consumers are still bearing the brunt of price rise. ""The consumers have been badly hit by the skyrocketing prices of vegetables during rains. In this circumstances, price rise of onions will definitely put burden on us,"" said Nirakar Pradhan, a consumer."

Picture by Swapnaneel Bhattacharjee Silchar, Aug. 19: Karimganj deputy commissioner Pradip Kumar Talukdar today said teams would be sent to markets across the district to inspect whether uniformity is being maintained in prices of vegetables. The prices have shot up immensely following the recent waves of floods. A large number of citizens have alleged that some vendorsraders, taking advantage of the floods, are charging arbitrarily. Talukdar, who held a meeting with administration officials this afternoon on the issue, said a report would be submitted on the basis of the inspection and stern action would be taken against those found to have fleeced the public by overcharging them. Currently, the prices of some of the vegetables are - chilly (Rs 300/kg), brinjal (Rs 80/kg), string beans (Rs 80/kg), tomato (Rs 70/kg), ridge gourd (Rs 60/kg), cabbage, radish, eddoe (all Rs 50/kg), onion and sayote (Rs 40/kg) and potato (Rs 20/kg). These rates are prevalent in most markets, including Chantar Bazar, Nilambazar, Shanibari Bazar and Kaliganj. In some places, the prices fluctuate and are even higher, residents alleged. The general secretary of Chantar Bazar Byabsayi Samiti, Pijush Das, said crops have been damaged across the state because of floods this year, pushing up the prices of vegetables, and it would take some time for circumstances to return to normal. He added that vegetables are being sold at rates equal to other markets in Chantar Bazar market and that vendors here do not fleece customers. Narrating the plight of lower middle class and poor people because of unethical practices adopted by a section of vendors, Abdul Bakkar, a retired grade IV government employee, said people are already facing extreme financial troubles because of the floods and the skyrocketing prices of vegetables/commodities added insult to injury. crisis of having vegetables in the district In summer, farmers of Karimganj district grow vegetables like okra, ridge gourd, bottle gourd, pointed gourd, bitter gourd, cucumber and others. In winter, vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower, turnip, carrot, capsicum and others are grown, he mentioned. Nearly 2,300 hectares of cultivable land, where vegetables are grown, have been damaged and more than 30,000 farmers have suffered losses because of floods this year. Sources said vegetables are being brought to Karimganj from Tripura, Shillong and Barpeta district, among others. However, since floods have affected those places too, the problem has been aggravated."

The star hotel has partnered with Gujarat Tourism for the food promotion.We began with Hondvo, Methi Na Muthiya and Petis Corn Tikka. We liked the muthiya as the besan batter was nicely mixed with spices like Shepherds Purse, black salt and dry fenugreek leaves. Petis Corn Tikka was crispy and at the same time filling because of potatoes. To go with the starters, were an array of pickles such as green chilies pickle, mango pickle both in sweet and sour variety. In the main course, what we liked was Sev Tamatar: a preparation of tomato curry to which crispy crunchy sev was added. It tasted really well with Bajre Ki Roti and Thepla. We also tried Gujarati Kadhi with Bardoli Ki Khichdi. Gujarati Daal was a bit sweet like other dishes. Executive chef Nitin Mathur from Ahmedabad along with few other chefs curated the menu.For the desserts we recommend Moong Daal Ka Sheera and Mohanthhal: a halwa of yellow lentils with fried nuts.

Here's how you can opt for healthy ready-to-eat...,http://www.hindustantimes.com/fitness/canned-food-got-you-in-a-pickle-here-s-how-you-can-opt-for-healthy-ready-to-eat-meals/story-69mV8NyIUMsBFC4D0osBzK.html,2017-10-01,"Theres nothing more satiating than relishing a traditional home cooked meal after a tiring day at work. But, thanks to our lifestyle, cooking after work feels like a tiresome chore. And, this is the reason why we are increasingly opting for ready-to-eat processed Indian meals, packaged chutneys and pickles. The appeal of these processed products is simple. You dont have to cook; they go straight from spoon to mouth. However, we conveniently ignore the fact that these processed foods come laden with preservatives that are extremely unhealthy and ecologically unsustainable. To combat the rise of packaged unsustainable Indian foods, many food enthusiasts are popularising homemade Indian sustainable products, which include pickles, condiments and ready-made meals. I love cooking traditional South Indian meals. Every time I used an age old recipe, I struggled with getting authentic masalas. The ready-made condiments available in the market lack authentic flavour and aroma. Thats when I decided to make my own masalas. I make gunpowder, sambar powder and tamarind rice mix at home. They became so popular among my friends that they prodded me to launch my own range of masalas. We use traditional recipes to make preservative free, fresh, natural, and healthy products, says 50-year-old Sudha Raj. She started her venture last year in August, under the name of Zing, along with her 58-year- old sister, Sushila Srinivasan. Sudha says its a myth that homemade masalas and condiments have a very short shelf life. The shelf life of these products can go up to one year, depending on the product. Her products start at Rs150.Preserving our rich culinary traditionApart from being healthy, sustainable food products help preserve our rich culinary tradition. Our recipes have been handed over through generations. I dont think you can enjoy authentic Indian food if you club processed product to your food. What we make at home is free of chemicals and added colours. Our raw papaya, tomato and garlic relish and pickles such as adrak ka achar and hari mirch ka achar are very popular . The starting price of one jar is Rs100,says 34-year- old chef Chandrashekar, who has been making homemade preservative-free pickles for 4 years now.Economic ChallengesMango chilli jam available at Rummy Kitchen .Despite various benefits that come with sustainable products, economic challenges are a barrier to making it a preferred choice for consumers as compared to packaged products. Organic, fresh ingredients are expensive to acquire. Competing with big brands that produce in bulk and sell at low cost, is difficult. Consumers also prefer buying off-the-shelf products. And convenience and pricing become the determining factor, says 45-year-old Inderpreet Nagpal, who started her food venture Rummy Kitchen, three years ago.Inderpreet makes organic pickles and jams. Her range includes chicken, surmai, pork, prawns, keema pickles and jams such as mutton chilli jam and bacon jam. The starting price for one jar is Rs200.Apart from the expensive ingredients, getting a license to market homemade products to grocery stores is also a challenge. You need to register and get a license to market your product. To get a license to sell, you need to show a turnover of at least Rs12 lakh minimum. This is why our products dont make it to grocery stores, says Sudha Raj.Aloo Goli available at Just 2 Eat.So, how does one deal with the economic challenge? 42-year-old Manmohan Singh, who started his venture Just 2 Eat, six months ago, believes that one can deal with economic hindrances by mass producing sustainable food items. We produce packaged Indian food without using preservatives. Through our NGO Singh Educational Welfare Association along with the help of KVIC (Khadi And Village Industries Commission), we impart culinary skills to children above the age of 16 years in rural places. The advantage of this is that we are able to produce mass quantities of sustainable Indian food. These kids acquire the necessary skills to start their own small venture in the near future. Also, it stops rural migration of the children to metropolitan cities, says Singh. His products start at Rs90 and include ready-to-eat dishes such as Aloo Gobhi, Rajma Chawal, and Chicken Biryani.Expert opinion on preservativesPreservatives contains chemicals such as formalin and sodium metaborate. They are high in sodium content. In the long run, they can harm our internal organs such as heart, liver and the kidneys. They also cause high blood pressure and obesity. Packaged products that have a very long shell life are risky, as they contain too many preservatives. Preservatives can make us feel lethargic and irritated. - Dr Mohsin Wali, cardiologist and former honorary physician to the President"

Punjab's tomatoes free of pesticides, says study by Union...",http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/results-encouraging-punjab-s-tomatoes-free-of-pesticides-says-studies/story-bUKqhsrSoc0iLRiROG2lEM.html,2017-10-28,"In a positive surprise, the tomato grown in Punjab is free of pesticides, according to a Union government project meant to study the impact of the indiscriminate use of chemical fertilisers and insecticides on crops. The National Institute of Plant Health Management (NIPHM), a body under the Union agriculture ministry, is conducting the three-year study in collaboration with Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana. The study began in October last year.Use of proper techniques, giving the correct amount of dose at an appropriate time and increased awareness among farming community has led to the positive results.The first-year results of the study are encouraging. Things are not as bad as we think. We couldnt find as much pesticide residue as has been publicised. In none of the tomato samples, did we detect pesticides above the prescribed MRL (Maximum Residue Limit), said Dr G Jayalakshmi, director NIPHM, adding that pesticide residues couldnt be detected from samples taken from organic and Integrated Pest Management (IPM) fields. IPM is a method by which soil is worked on to make it better prepared for pest management.Some fruit samples drawn from conventional farmers fields showed the presence of residues of mancozeb, profenophos and triazophos, but these were also below the MRL levels and thus safe, she added.The methodology of the studyTwo crops were studied in both kharif and rabi seasons. To distinguish between fields, samples were also taken from organic and conventional fields. Specifically, samples were collected from one-acre fields in Swal village in Sultanpur Lodhi, Kapurthala. The organic field selected was from Dvyagram village, Nurmahal, in Jalandhar. For conventional fields, 10 villages in Kapurthala were chosen to take samples.Pesticide consumption has dropped: PAU studyAs if to support this theory, a PAU study found that the consumption of insecticides in Punjab has declined from 3,800 metric tonnes in 2001-02 to 2,344 metric tonnes in 2016-17, a drop of around 40%. Another PAU study on status of pesticide residues in Punjab done on 5,224 food crops from 2011 to 2017 also shows that almost 92% of crops were free of pesticides. This signals a significant trend reversal as a similar study on 1,507 crops done three decades ago from 1981 to 1990 showed only 22% within the safe limit. PAU vice-chancellor Dr Baldev Singh Dhillon said, Tomatoes are also consumed raw in large quantities and the studys results are welcome.Punjab farmer now far more educated: PAU VCAdvances in research have contributed to ensuring food safety and ensured that pesticide residues in crops is contained within limits, PAU V-C Baldev Singh Dhillon said. He added that the Punjabi farmer is now far more educated. Use of proper techniques, giving the correct amount of dose at an appropriate time and increased awareness among farming community has led to the positive results, he added."

While the total area under horticulture crops in the block is 2,000 to 2,200 hectares, 70 per cent of the land is under tomato cultivation.Wilt disease in the tomato crops was first reported from Sorda gram panchayat (GP) a fortnight back and now the disease is spreading to newer areas. Nuagaon Assistant Horticulture Officer (AHO), Soumya Pathak, and Assistant Agriculture Officer (AAO), P Mandal, visited some of the affected areas and confirmed the spread of the disease.Pathak said from symptoms in the affected plants, it appeared to be viral wilt disease and 25 to 30 per cent of the late kharif crop was affected. He said during inquiry, farmers admitted to repeating tomato cultivation on the same piece of land which increases chances of virus contamination and fungus attacks. He said tomato crops requires less labour with high returns, luring farmers to opt for it.An affected farmer, Nath Samad of Golatoli hamlet under Sorda, said he had invested about `1.25 lakh on growing tomatoes over three acres of land but a majority of the standing crops has been damaged by the wilt disease. Farmers such as Ganju Oram of Banki village in Chitapedi GP, Anil Ekka of Barilepta GP and Soma Lakra of Sorda GP have similar stories to tell.Pathak said they have asked the affected tomato farmers to immediately remove the plants which are affected by the disease to save healthy plants and avoid repeating planting the crop on the same piece of land. He said from an acre, farmers get 50 to 60 quintals of indigenous tomato varieties, while the yield is 250 to 300 quintals per acre for hybrid tomato crops.Panposh Assistant Horticulture Director (ADH) S P Nayak said spraying of pesticide was taken up by some farmers, but it did not work. It is impossible to contain the spread of the disease with any form of treatment, including pesticide application and the only viable option is to remove affected plants, he said, adding that a study would be conducted soon to assess the total crop damage.Nuagaon caters to bulk tomato requirement of Rourkela city and at present, the vegetable is priced at about Rs 50 per kg. Last year too, the tomato farmers of Nuagaon had faced loss in the shape of distress sale due to bumper crop."

During the auspicious month of Kartika, the soaring vegetable prices has hit the common man hard. During Kartika, most people avoid non-vegetarian food owing to religious beliefs.According to reports, the cheapest vegetable available in the market is ivy gourd (kunduri), which is priced at Rs 26 per kg. Brinjal and ladies finger cost Rs 50 and Rs 60 per kg, respectively. While beans come at a price of Rs 70 per kg, tomato is priced at Rs 60 per kg. Potato, the most popular vegetable, is being sold at Rs 16 per kg, thereby eating into the budget of the common man.The prices of vegetables are so high that I am contemplating to sell the rice, which I get at Rs 1 per kg, for my daily needs, said Prafulla Malik, a BPL villager of Gopabandhupur in the district. For him, selling the BPL rice is the only option as his daily earning is not enough to buy vegetable for his six-member family. Similar is the plight of several below poverty line families who are feeling the pinch of high vegetable price.For middle class families, non-vegetarian food has become a cheaper option. But we cannot afford to have non-vegetarian food daily, said Kathia Jena of Rajpur.The worst-hit are vegetarian hotels of the district. Dipu Nayak, owner of a vegetarian hotel, said, For the last few days, I am incurring a loss of Rs 500 on a daily basis. Now, I feel compelled to include non-vegetarian food in the menu to retain my customers.According to local traders, the vegetable market here depends on neighbouring States such as West Bengal, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh. Due to hike in prices of vegetables there, the market here has been affected, they said.The demand for vegetables has increased in the wake of marriage season and this is another reason for the price hike, said Valu Khanaa, a vegetable vendor. Sources in the Regulated Market Committee said vegetables worth Rs 7 lakh are sold in Bhadrak town daily. The sales double during marriage season.Sources said vegetable farming is being hardly given any importance in the district with over 95 per cent of vegetables being imported from other States. Deputy Director of Agriculture, Bhadrak, Tankadhar Behera said due to lack of storage and irrigation facilities, farmers show little interest in vegetable farming."

Today, he is reaping rich dividends from it. Apart from paddy cultivation, the father and son duo grows vegetable as well as fruits with help of two deep bore wells and are also into pisciculture.Prior to joining of Bismaya, Laxminarayan was cultivating paddy in only over five acres of land till 1999. He started vegetable farming in 2000 and cultivated pointed gourd (potal) in over half an acre of land and even managed to earn a profit of `20,000 in the first year. Subsequently, he ventured into cultivation of pumpkin, tomato as well as brinjal and expanded vegetable farming to over one and a half acres of land. Currently, the father-son duo earns a profit of about `50,000 per annum from vegetables only.Later, on being informed that pisciculture offers good returns, Laxminarayan dug up a tank in one acre of land with subsidised loan amounting to `90,000 from the Fisheries department. He spent `1.27 lakh to start pisciculture and released fish spawns of Rohu, Common Carp and Catla into the tank.Now, the father and son harvest around eight quintal of fish annually and earn a profit of about `50,000 per annum.After making up his mind to join his father, Bismaya decided to devote his entire time to farming activities and began banana cultivation in over one acre of land with support from National Horticulture Mission.Bismaya said they spent about `1.20 lakh to start banana cultivation with help of drip irrigation. In the first year of harvesting, they managed to recover the total expenditure. The saplings were provided free of cost by the Horticulture department along with subsidy on drip irrigation, he said.In the second year, the father-son duo earned a profit of `1 lakh after incurring an expenditure of `20,000. They have already earned a profit of more than `50,000 during the current year and the financial gain will cross `1 lakh, he said.Altogether, they earned a profit of about `2.5 lakh per annum, including profit of `50,000 from paddy cultivated over 10 acres as sharecroppers besides their own 3.5 acres of land.Buoyed by the profit from banana, Bismaya has planned to expand its cultivation to one and a half acres of more land from the next kharif season besides potal in over another half an acre.Bismaya said they face no problem in selling their produce as traders come to the village to procure it. I am happy after taking up farming as a profession and this decision of mine has proved to be a success, he added."

(Above): Workers in the final stages of pack gherkins with acid preservatives and vinegar in Ranebennuru in Haveri district, Karnataka. (Below) The gherkin is a demanding crop; even a one-day delay in picking the fruit makes it unviable. A farm hand in Ranebennuru, Haveri district.Sudhakara JainManzoor, a farmer barely in his 20s, picks up a small prickly fruit. He scrapes at its rough green skin, which is covered in hair. I know for sure you cant eat this, he says. He speaks of a large company, whose local agents contacted him with seeds, contracts and promises earlier this year. It is actually medicine, he adds, with some confidence. When he puts it down, he washes his hands thoroughly, and uses a stone to exfoliate the fingers. Pesticide, he says, corrodes the skin, turning it rough and whitish.Neat rows of strings and poles divide his one acre farm into grids. Water marks the channel in the middle, and the creepers clinging desperately to strings are beginning to wilt with disease.Manzoor is astonished to hear that people in other parts of the world eat the medicine that he grows. No one has told him that in the West, pickled gherkin is a condiment, as common on dining tables as pepper. Confounded, he calls his neighbours, who have been growing gherkins in their village Thimmapura in Haveri district, close to the River Tungabhadra in Central Karnataka. They laugh. No, it cannot be. When our children come here, we have to keep an eye on them. If they eat it, they will fall sick. It fills the stomach with gas, says Rajappa, another young farmer who has been growing gherkins for the past five years.The recent rains have transformed the undulating plains into a quilt of green. In these chequered fields sliced up only by roads and irrigation canals, rice, maize, sugarcane and millets have been the traditional crops. Its only over the past decade that the gherkins have slowly established a foothold.But the bad news is that this seasons crop has been washed out by unseasonal rains. The three gherkin crops in a year are typically grown from April to June, August to October, and December to February.Discussing gherkins with farmers inevitably leads to narratives of agrarian distress, migrations, and failed bore wells. Amid the vinegar flavours of gherkin processing centres in Karnakatas agro-processing zones spread across eight districts, managers and exporters list out their concerns. These range from the Goods and Service Tax, which shrinks their working capital, to the international outrage over Russian military aggression, to even the weather in Vietnam. A bumper crop in that country could affect the fortunes of the crop back home in India, and thus the lives of Manzoor and Rajappa.A crop like no otherWith little domestic demand, the foreign crop is like no other in the State, and perhaps in the country. Seeds sealed in neat packets are brought in all the way from Europe. Export companies engage farmers through contracts, and it is in the unpredictable agrarian environs of Karnataka that the alien fruit is birthed.The fruit, however, undergoes a series of chemical treatments before being shipped thousands of miles again, with its final destination ranging from the restaurants of Madrid to the supermarkets of Manhattan.In the 1990s, as information technology (IT) and the outsourcing boom transformed Bengaluru, a few hundred kilometres away, exporters found in the relative warmth of districts such as Kolar and Bagepalli the perfect conditions for the cultivation of gherkins. Just like the IT boom, this one, too, was founded on cheap labour.For more than a decade, this sector saw on average an annual growth rate of 20%. Export companies popped up like mushrooms in food parks and SEZs. While banks announced special loans, agriculture policies dangled special incentives, and gherkin contract farming spread across the State. The gherkin revolution has turned many impoverished farmers into lakhpathis, stated a 2006 report by the Institute for Social and Economic Change (ISEC) in 2006.By 2014, over 1.31 lakh farmers in southern India were engaged in gherkin cultivation. The sectors exports touched Rs. 1,200 crore, an impressive feat considering that a decade ago, exports were barely worth Rs. 180 crore.When it was dropped into the State two decades ago, the fruit did not have a local name. Now it goes by the odd term medicine cucumber. Most say that it is a corruption of the Kannada word,midi, meaning small. Farmers in areas where gherkins are just making an entry into the landscape think that the name is on account of it being made into medicine (some believe it cures piles), or, perhaps, because the fruit leaves a bitter aftertaste, like a tablet.Karnataka, where gherkin cultivation covers 20 out of the 30 districts, accounts for more than 60% of Indias production, with the neighbouring States of Andhra Pradesh, Maharasthra and Tamil Nadu chipping in.Similar to the dynamics in the IT sector, where a policy announcement on the other side of the world tends to echo through the air-conditioned corridors of Bengaluru, the gherkin industry is also highly vulnerable to the headwinds of global events.The Russia problemIn 2014, parts of central Karnataka saw copious monsoon rains even as large parts of the State battled drought. The perfect conditions yielded a bumper crop. But just a few months before the monsoons arrived, something unexpected happened: Russian soldiers took over the courthouses and government buildings of Crimea.The Russian annexation of Crimea had begun. Despite international outrage, a referendum was conducted. Eventually, a pro-Russia government was installed to govern the peninsula where no gherkins are grown.As Russia faced sanctions from Europe and America, suddenly, Indias largest importer of gherkins found itself unable to afford the fruit. Thousands of miles away, in nondescript villages of Karnataka where news from the outside world is hard to come by, company agents were suddenly obsessed with the Russia crisis.A conversation in Hemodre, a village in drought-prone Sira taluk near the Andhra Pradesh border, triggers an impromptu gathering of curious farmers. Beeresh, 30, the local agent, is called in to explain the dynamics of gherkin cultivation in the village.Beereshs job is to talk to farmers, perhaps even give loans (sometimes from his own pocket), so that they shift to gherkin cultivation. He has to ensure enough produce to meet the targets, which are decided by the companies based on the export orders they have received. The credit he gives to the farmers is later deducted from the payments made for the gherkin produce.I used to contract 250 farmers. But due to the Russia problem and other issues, we were asked to cut down on acreage as demand dipped. Now there are 150 farmers, but they dont do it regularly enough, he says. With the cut in supply, his commissions have dropped. He is now in a debt of more than Rs. 2 lakh, which he hopes to pay off when the market stabilises.About 200 km away, in a recently refurbished factory that sticks out incongruously in the maize and sugarcane fields of southern Ballari district, the air smells of the acid preservatives in which gherkins are stored.Srinivas R., the factory manager, explains what happened when Crimea was annexed. In 2014-15, the factory handled 14,000 tonnes. We prepared for a bumper crop, and suddenly the orders dipped. The rouble had crashed, from 38 to 83 roubles to a dollar. The Russians were no longer able to buy gherkins in bulk from here. We had tonnes of gherkins with no buyers, he says. Within a year, the acreage sown in the area reduced by 40%.The setback reverberated through company balance sheets. Exports to Russia came down from Rs. 234 crore in 2014-15 to just Rs. 90 crore in 2016-17. Russia remains the key, for it is the only importing country that takes lower-grade gherkins which are often rejected by European buyers.The crisis devastated the industry. At least five companies with significant investments  some owned by hotel, telecom and steel tycoons  have folded up. These are difficult times, compounded by international and domestic problems, says Mune Gowda, who heads Exotic Agro Pvt. Ltd., and is the Treasurer of the Indian Gherkin Exporter's Association. Even the U.S. has started importing from Mexico, while Vietnam is catching up in gherkin production, he says. In the past three years, a quarter of the gherkin farmers have stopped production for various reasons, estimates the association. Production has dipped by over 70,000 metric tonnes. Making up for the loss of the Russian market by tapping the European one proved difficult as the latter is choosy and has strict compliance norms and certification requirements.The foreignerDomestically, cultivating gherkins comes with its own problems. Unpredictable weather takes a toll on the crop. The gherkin itself is a demanding crop that takes its pound of flesh from the land on which it is sown. It acts like a foreigner who lives here, says Ranganath at Hemodre village. He is relatively less enamoured of the cucumber. He is not taken in by the promise of high yields. If the wind changes direction for an hour, it falls sick, he says.Gherkins need constant care, which isnt easy given the harsh realities of farming in India: monsoons are erratic and prone to failure; rural distress has sparked large-scale migrations and reduction in the availability of labour; tropical diseases sweep across large tracts; and groundwater reserves are dwindling. This constant battle has made the farmers christen the fruitkiri kiritarakari(irritating vegetable) andsoutekaye savasa(problematic cucumber).A little more than a month after the seeds are sown, gherkins pop out of the base of the flower, yielding fruits incessantly for the next two months.It is here that the trouble begins. If it is not picked within a few hours of flowering, it grows exponentially in size, and for the farmers, the bigger it is, the smaller their returns. The gherkins are graded according to their size and there are five grades in all. The smallest gherkins (160 of them can fit in a crate) could fetch Rs. 32 per kilo. The biggest (less than 30 in a crate) fetch just Rs. 2. If transportation of the plucked gherkins is delayed, up to one-third of the produce could be lost.We need 15 labourers a day just to pick the fruit. Most of the youth have gone to Bengaluru or Hyderabad for jobs. If we delay the picking by one day, the gherkin grows and becomes unviable for us, said 41-year-old Siddarameshwara in the remote Udramappanahalli village of Sira taluk. His crop this year has been ravaged by mildew, which sets upon gherkins when it rains.Its because of these reasons that despite his success with the crop in the past 10 years, he has confined gherkins to just 0.5 acres of his 12-acre farm. As white, stringy fungus envelops the gherkin, he hopes that the winter crop can compensate for his loss. However, in the slight chill of the winter lurks the melon fly which, farmers say, no quantity of pesticide can effectively contain.More disconcertingly, the crop guzzles water. If the field is not irrigated daily, gherkins become shrivelled and bent, unsuitable for export. For the 50 days or so that it flowers, farmers have to draw water from their borewells. If maize needs water thrice in two weeks, the gherkin needs it every day. Maize is grown twice a year; gherkins thrice a year. For all the three seasons to yield sizeable profits, it needs more than 150 days of irrigation.The guru of gherkinsEight years ago, it was the sight of a group of Spaniards inspecting gherkins in Bagepalli, just 100 km from Bengaluru close to the Andhra Pradesh border, that enthralled villagers. Taking them around the clusters of gherkin villages was B. Srinivas, whose company acted as a conduit for the bigger companies and farmers. The Spaniards had told the gherkin growers that the produce here was the best they had seen.Having taken to the gherkin sector in 1998, it was he and a small band of agents who persuaded farmers to try this new crop. Agents and company facilitators propped up. Bollywood-style films on gherkin management were shown to farmers to attract them to the crop. Gherkins, it was believed, could lift the region out of poverty.Srinivas remembers the gherkin rush. Farmers would line up for seeds. We could even do large swathes of 30 acres in each village. Things were easy back then.Over 1,000 acres of gherkins  a limit constrained only by the volume of the companies export orders  were sown in 2006-07. Money flowed as advances to farmers, agents kept a steep commission from the output, and for farmers, gherkins did translate into money.Then the inevitable happened. By the late 2000s, the rains started failing, and one by one, the borewells went dry. Groundwater dipped in places from 400 feet to more than 1,200 feet. In places where the borewells ran through the summer, they now stopped two months before the rains, and later, didnt function even in the winter. Gherkins, with their immediate need for water, were the first to be affected.By 2011, the number of red farmers  those with debts  rose dramatically, and the agents had to look farther for suitable land, with some going as far as Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh. It just didnt work out. We would get half an acre in one village and a couple of acres elsewhere far away. The debts kept rising. I had to get out, Srinivas says.In the hustle of the Bagepalli market, the man who many farmers and agents say was the guru of gherkins in the region now runs an agro-business focussing only on traditional vegetables and maize seeds. Just three agents operate now, and struggle to cumulatively cover 50 acres.Cycles of debtDrought and international price fluctuations have left behind a cycle of debt  unpaid loans for field agents and gherkin farmers, who, in turn, have to pledge a greater share of future gherkin production.In the past decade, the prices of the seeds, all imported, went up from 6 paise to 68 paise per seed. If tomato seeds cost Rs. 700 for 10,000, the cost for gherkins is up to Rs. 10,000. The returns, however, havent kept up. In the same period, the price of premium gherkins has gone up from Rs. 8 to Rs. 32 per kg.In some areas, agents have racked up debts of more than Rs. 50 lakh. Agents like Gangappa in Bagepalli who claims to have nearly Rs. 70 lakh in debt from farmers in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, have pinned their hopes on the recent rains that have filled up tanks. They hope that these farmers can repay the debt by cultivating gherkins again.The rains have indeed given life to the dry lands of Bagepalli, Sira and central Karnataka, which glimmer now in various shades of green. There is slight optimism in the corporate offices of exporters too: a steady year can blunt Indias reputation as an uncertain producer that frequently misses shipment dates. But is it possible that, somehow, the U.S. and Russia would normalise relations and bring Indian gherkins back on Russian tables?Well, the fruit is fickle and vulnerable, and uncertainties loom, much like the dark vestigial monsoon clouds that threaten to wash out this seasons crop.I used to contract 250 farmers. But due to the Russia problem and other issues, we were asked to cut down on acreage as demand dipped. Now there are 150 farmers, but they dont do it regularly enough.BeereshA local agentEven the U.S. has started importing from Mexico, while Vietnam is catching up in gherkin production.Mune GowdaHead, Exotic Agro Pvt.
