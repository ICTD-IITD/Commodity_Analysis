Prices that shot up after recent rains continue to remain high, deterring customers, the sellers say.K.V.S. GiriK.V.S. GIRIVegetable prices in the city continue to remain perched at increased rates despite monsoon withdrawal from the State nearing completion.Prices in the city increased during the first few days of October even as supply was affected. Vendors attributed the poor quality and high price of some commonly consumed vegetables to rains. A check of prices in government retail as well as wholesale markets suggested prices continue to pinch the common man.High quantityThough the quality and quantity has improved, the prices continue to be high. Customers have cut down on their purchase, said Venu Naik, a vegetable seller in Sainikpuri. The effect of rains in grower regions continue to affect prices.For instance, at the Bowenpally vegetable market, the arrival of hybrid variant of tomato had nearly doubled since the start of the month, accompanied with a three-time price increase. The variant was selling for a maximum price of Rs. 48 per kilo in the wholesale market. In retail markets however, the price was about Rs. 75 per kilo.The local variant of tomato is selling over Rs. 65 per kilo while the wholesale price stands at about Rs. 32 per kilo.Different pricesWhile potato and onion prices did not register a high, the cost of carrot continue to remain higher than its price last month. A kilo at Bowenpally market was listed at Rs. 55 on Tuesday. Carrot price in Rythu Bazars was around Rs. 70 with the private retail market demanding about Rs. 5 higher.The price of French bean at around Rs. 100 in the local private market, also remains higher than that of last month."
5a15126a9855b76bf13ea9b6,Letâ€™s start at the very beginning,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2017/oct/24/lets-start-at-the-very-beginning-1682002.html,2017-10-24,"CHENNAI: This week, we will cover about seed germination and transplanting.Seeds, where it all begins!There are various types of seeds  heirloom (naati), open pollinated (o/p), hybrid. However, heirloom or o/p seeds have the highest germination rate. A seed packet marked as F1 are hybrid varieties. A very common question asked by newbies is, the seed packets have Poison mentioned on the packets, is it safe to use them? They are completely safe to use for sowing purposes. The seeds are coated with a very thin layer of chemical so that the seeds do not rot or decay and have a longer shelf life.For plants such as methi, dill, etc seeds from the kitchen cupboard work but the germination rate is low, as they are processed for kitchen use. Most folks start off with buying seeds initially. Once they form a good network of gardening enthusiasts, they exchange seeds at meets and events. There are quite a number of green events held in Bangalore, which have stalls dedicated for selling seeds and saplings.GerminationOne can invest in a seeding/ germinating tray. A basic one costs about `50. Else you can also reuse/recycle egg shells, coconut shells, milk packet, juice cartons, curd cups etc. The most basic need for a seed to germinate is moisture. For making a germinating potting mix, you can take a few handfuls of cocopeat and compost, with some neem powder.The quantity of the ingredients need not be exact, since it will house the plant for just about 1-2 weeks. Germination time depends on various reasons like climate, source and health of the seeds. On an average seeds of bushy vegetable plants like tomato, brinjal, chilly take roughly 10 days. Methi seeds sprout in just 3-4 days.- Fill the germinating container with the above germinating potting mix.- Moisten the whole tray, by spraying water gently.- Make a small hole in the middle of each slot, with your finger/pencil, just a few millimeters deep.- Place the seed in the hole. Its a good idea to place 2-3 seeds so that at least one will germinate. Also there are sometimes lots of seeds in a single seed packet, which eventually one does not end up using. Use your own judgement !- Cover the holes with the potting mix around the slot, then give a very gentle press.- Place the tray in a bright but shaded place, away from direct sunlight.Sapling / TransplantingWhen you are transplanting from the seeding tray to the final container, make sure you are not doing it under direct sun. Do it around 6-7 am or 5-6 pm. Use extreme caution when taking out the sapling. Make sure that the stem along with the root structure and soil around the roots come out as a whole. Before taking the sapling out, you can gently press the outside of the seedling tray slot or container. You can use a spoon/fork to take out the sapling. Over a period of time, you will master this trick. TIP: If you plan to have, say, five tomato plants, then its a good idea to sow 10 seeds, just in case you loose some during the sowing, germinating or transplanting.In the final container make a hole in the middle, wide and deep enough to hold the sapling. If you have some cow dung, you can place it in the hole, before placing the sapling, so that the young plant gets some extra nutrition to sustain its initial days.Once transplanted, keep the container in a shady place. This will enable the sapling to bear the transplant shock. Water the container carefully, so as not to harm the sapling, as mentioned in the tips above. If at the initial stage (after transplanting), you feel that your plant needs support, you can stake the plant for support. Staking is placing a thin but strong piece of wood (similar to pencil). Insert it into the pot near the seedling, but not too close to the roots. Use a thread and tie the sapling loosely to the stick. This will give some support to the plant for the first few weeks of its life.Enjoy watching your plant grow from a seed over a few weeks and months!"

We caught up with the Delhi-based writer, painter and travel enthusiast ahead of the launch of her debut novel She and He in the city on November 25. Love and relationships define our very being, yet sometimes we forget its significance in our lives. We live very mechanical lives these days. My book is a reminder for this generation that love is everything, she smiles.A self-admitted hopelessly hopeful romantic, she says that the book focuses on the many facets of the man-woman relationship - both the simple and difficult. I have compared it with Yin-Yang and Siva-Sakti, where one is incomplete without the other. You cannot spark a dialogue on one aspect, without talking about the other. It is symbiotic, organic yet complex, she laughs.So what exactly prompted her to explore the dynamics of this puzzling bond? All that I have written is a reflection of my own experiences with relationships, and also those of my friends and family. I think personal anecdotes tend to make the narrative stronger and make people connect with the story better, she avers. I am an engineer with a mass communication degree, but writing has always been on my mind. From the 15-year-old about to touch the flames of love for the first time to a senior citizen, who has endured what life has thrown at him or her, I believe that everybody will be able to relate to the plot.Though this is the first time that Astha has penned a book on the subject, it is not the first time that she has tried to creatively express the dimensions of the man-woman relationship. As I am an artist as well, I had already come up with an exhibition of paintings based on the same theme in 2015. I also plan to do a She and He cookbook, featuring simple recipes with flavours that marry well. For example garlic bread and tomato soup, and even a short story series soon, she grins.Word of adviceAfter being turned down by publications, Astha decided to just go for it and self-publish her book. She recommends the same to aspiring writers.She & He is available on Amazon and is priced at `500"

My whole family felt safe there. We were content with nature, with the birds and the squirrels, and we all ate idlis together in my garden, recalls Lakshmi Venkatasubramaniyan, with tears in her eyes. CE spoke to her about her 1,200sqft garden and the techniques she follows to maintain it. The 45-year- old has been terrace gardening since 2002, starting with flowering plants.Lakshmi Venkatasubramaniyanin her gardenHer garden, with 5ft trimmed trees such as red guava, chikku, star fruit, custard apple, varieties of drumstick, tamarind, herbs such as stevia (good for diabetics), Thai and Italian basil, krishnar tulsi, flowering plants such as jasmine including ramabanam and ramar malli, adeniums (dessert rose), thazhampoo, vegetables such as multivitamin spinach- all vitamins, bay leaf constituting to more than 300 plants, shows her passion for plants.Those days, my father grew ladys finger and tomato and my mother plucked flowers from our own plants. It was a part of our life. Thats how I started, she says. However, she was new to terrace gardening when she began. The BSc Math graduate gained knowledge from Namaalwar books, videos, facebook pages and a lot of other books on gardening techniques. I struggled to change from traditional pot mixes, which contained, red soil, river soil and cow dung, to the modern method of adding coco pete to the soil, she says. Coco pete or coir pith is a spongy medium that when mixed with soil, can retain water in it and makes the pot mix loose and lightweight for terrace gardening.One blunder she talks about is blindly following books that instruct people to 'pluck leaves that are infected'. Each day, I plucked one leaf of peerkanga and one day only the stem remained, she laughs.When space hinders gardening, she suggests beginners to do plant companion planting where a tree, herb and creeper can be grown together. Grow kaaramani, fenugreek and thatta payiru as companion plants with other plants, as they are nitrogen fixating plants. Vertical garden can be opted for if there is no space. Customised pots are available to be fixed on the wall, she says.If spending for plants hinders gardening, dont worry, she has solutions for that too. Replace jute bags, milk packets, aata bags, watermelon skin, egg shell or orange skin if grow bags are not affordable.I have remodeled a tire in to a container for spinach and it works out well, she shares.The right time to sow seeds is aadi maasam, she says. October- January winter vegetables such as carrot, coriander, broccoli, exotic veggies, stevia and strawberry can be grown.While all want to get rid of pests, she says that good pests follow bad pests. So we cant completely eradicate pests, but can distract them with 3G, perungayum, buttermilk, panjakavya, jeevamrithum which is made by processing cow dung, cow urine, handful of garden soil, besan flour for three days. On the fourth day, dilute it with water in 1:10 ratio to enrich the microbes in the soil.Plants in turn take nutrition from them. Strong smell of herbs such as mint, neem leaves, karpuravalli and tulsi can also distract bad pests by covering the smell of other plants.I buy red sand, seeds, cow dung and bone meal which is rich in phosphorus from the Cathedral road nursery, she says, as she believes the place is reliable. She has been awarded the 'Outstanding Gardener' award 2015 at Chennai gardens meet, organic garden foundation, and first prize in best terrace garden competition held by VGP trust in September, 2016."

For the past three decades, she has been helping foreign tourists acquaint themselves with traditional cuisines of India.And the meals prepared and served at her house in a true Indian manner always leave foreigners satisfied and with everlasting memories. Hema welcomes foreigners with a garland and tilak. Before they depart, she gives them tamboola as a gift. She uses only plantain leaves to serve the meals. She takes every possible care to ensure that foreigners enjoy fresh food and warm hospitality.Hema also teaches foreigners how to eat food without using spoons and chopsticks. She describes in detail various kinds of ingredients used for preparing the meals and their health benefits. A detailed menu card helps foreigners get familiar with the name of traditional South Indian delicacies. Often, she is seen taking the foreigners to markets to introduce them to local vegetables and spices. The right amount of spices is necessary for a healthy food, she always tells her guests.In our country, we do not use so much of spices and flavours. The South Indian food we had here was very delicious and exotic. The flavours blended so well and the taste was just incredible. Mango chitranna, brinjal gojju, tomato bath prepared using dry fruits and rotis were very good. We would love to visit this place again, says Jessica from the US.Carina Maria from Germany adds: I savoured the food with ghee and the colourful palyas. I learnt some of the recipes from Hema and just cannot wait to try them when I am back home.Hema also runs a cooking school Indias Royal Kitchen at her residence in Vontikoppal, where several foreigners have learnt the tricks of the culinary trade. Not just your tongue, but the food should also be able to satiate the eyes and the nose. The aroma and the look of the food trigger the senses in the body, making one feel like trying it. If grinded together, the spices blend well, and the right flavour of the spices leaves one craving for more, explains the 50-year-old avid cook.Over her tryst with cooking, Hema says, I started cooking at the age of eight. Pancakes and South Indian filtered coffee were the two things that I learnt to prepare first. Fascinated by the grinding stone, I soon started spending more time in the kitchen. As a child, I got to eat the best homemade food rich in spices. My grandmother and mother were both passionate about cooking.Her favourite dish: Majjige Huliconsecutive days. When asked to share the recipe for the same, she said: First cut the ash gourd to small cubes and put them to boil in a vessel. Then grind green chillies, cumin, coconut, coriander leaves, chana dal and moong dal. Once the ash gourd is soft, add the masala and boil. Later, add curd and cook for one boil. Oil, mustard and curry leaves could be used for seasoning. The delicious curry will be ready.Indian food in foreign kitchensHema Malini Devi has held several cooking workshops across the globe. I was once invited by Berea University to give presentation on the spices and conduct cooking workshops. I taught them the significance of spices and South Indian delicacies. Everyone enjoyed the sessions and since then, I have cooked Indian food umpteen times in foreign kitchens, says Hema. I have travelled to San Francisco, Taos in New Mexico, Houston, London and several European countries to conduct cooking workshops. I had held a session for students of Andrews University too, adds Hema, who is the granddaughter of Sujaya Kanthamaniavaru, the second sister of Sri Jayachamaraja Wadiyar."

Farmers in state have already suffered successive droughts since 2015, and more rains could result in huge losses for them. Experts feel there will be a surge in post-harvest diseases if such moist conditions persist throughout October. Dr N Nagaraj, Professor of Plant Pathology, University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS) told Express that if it rains heavily during October, farmers tend to harvest their crops early.Due to such showers, it becomes a problem for farmers to dry and store the produce. As a result, post-harvest diseases such as formation of moulds will increase and hurt revenues of the farmer, he said. Quoting the example of an experimental plot of UAS, he said that the plot of land that used to give 200 kg of harvest might provide a maximum harvest of 140 kg of vegetables this year. Perishable crops like tomato are affected by diseases such as Phytophthora Late Blight. Other crops such as papaya, chillies and vegetables will be affected due to spell of rains, he said.Crops such as moong bean, maize, jowar and ragi too are not exempt from the consequences of such weather. Paddy is among the few crops that will not be affected much, he said. However, rains effect ragi, when earheads are growing in the plants. If water stands in the ragi form, the earheads will sprout, leading to loss for farmers, he said. Shivkumar Naiklal, scientist at Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Cell said that overcast conditions also effect crops which are about to flower. He said that 99% of the State had adequate moisture in soil, after two years of moisture stress due to drought."

Started by Bikash Parikh, who worked in the sports sector earlier but had a dream of starting his own place, the concept of the restaurants is driven on him wanting to break the myth that healthy, vegetarian food isn't tasty.The menu is limited, and the food is all made fresh. We don't store anything, the food is all made fresh. And because of that, if your meal takes about ten minutes more to get ready, says Parikh.We started the meal with a carrot and ginger juice and a peanut butter smoothie topped with granola. Both were delicious and just right on the sweetness factor. The Mezze Platter looked healthy, sounded healthy and was high on taste, with homemade multigrain breads, beetroot humus, chia seed humus and tahini. Next was the Raw Papaya and Soba Noodle with Som Tum dressing salad  one of the best raw papaya salads we have tried of late, with just the right amount of Asian flavours and spice. We also tried the Vietnamese Pho with Soba Noodles, the flavours hit the spot that chilly evening. Global cuisine at pure vegetarian eateries wasn't common in the city. This is something I wanted to change, and that's why you find Asian, Italian, Mexican cuisine on the menu, says Parikh.For the mains, we tried the Whole Wheat Spaghetti with Tomato Ragout and the Cottage Cheese steak with Mexican Rice. The spaghetti had a very home cooked feel to it, as did most of the food, and was loaded with vegetables. Though not a fan of cottage cheese, the steak was grilled and topped with a sauce that complemented it perfectly, and when paired with the rice and grilled vegetables, the overall experience was a satisfying one.If you want something sweet (and healthy) after your meal, ask for the special of the day. Although they didn't have any of the specials that day, as the desserts are all made with fresh ingredients, we did sample some sweet treats from the in-house bakery called The Bakehouse. We tried an oreo chesecake and a salted caramel tart, both of which tasted like they came out from your mother's oven, simple, flavoursome and comforting.The decor is also eco-friendly. The limestone and mud walls, along with the rustic artifacts and restored teak wood floors, resonate Prikh's belief of keeping things local, and that you don't have to spend exorbitant amounts to make a space look good.If you're in the mood to eat simple and healthy, then Little Green Cafe is just for you. They've just started to experiment with stand-up comedy and live gigs, so check their social media pages to find out more.Cost for two: Rs 800 (approx)"

Heavy rains that lashed the state in the past two months have pushed up the prices of vegetables. While the price of tomato has gone up from Rs 20 to Rs 40 per kg in the retail market, it has jumped from Rs 22 to Rs 49 per kg at HOPCOMS. Similarly, the price of chilli has doubled from Rs 40 to Rs 80 per kg in the retail market. Coriander, that must ingredient, is out of reach: it has jumped from Rs 25 to Rs 50 per bunch in the retail market. And this trend is likely to continue for another 15 days.Vegetable prices have soared in Mysuru, Hubballi and Mangaluru too. Market experts say that the unusual pattern of rainfall is to be blamed for the price rise. Vendors said that since the crops have been destroyed in rain-abundant districts, prices have skyrocketed. G R Srinivas, former president, HOPCOMS, said, Wherever rainfall has been more, crops have been damaged. It will take another month or two for the next crop to be successfully harvested. Till then the prices will see an inflation.Russell Market Traders Association General Secretary Idrees Chaudhury said, Farmers say the situation wont improve for another 15 days. Customers who purchased one kilo of produce are buying quarter kilo. Sales have dropped.A vendor in Shivajinagar, Mohammed Shahnawaz, said, It is not just rain that played spoilsport.

Well, what else would you expect from a curry place, you ask? Well, at Coyla Cababs and Curries, Whitefield, I was pleasantly surprised, having found myself indulging in a heartwarming and the most comforting loaf of an aristocratic naan that pledges its allegiance to a royal pedigree. I got a taste of Taftan, a leavened flour bread that traces back to Persia.Coyla , Four Points by Sheraton offers Makhanwala Ghar Ka Paneer, Amritsari Pindi Chole, Sarson Ka Saag, Succulent Nalli Nihari and the traditional Kukkad Makhanwala among other desi preparations.The Paneer Tikka Angare has the fluffy cottage cheese grilled in a tandoor, leaving you with a taste of roasted spices and a moist paneer. The Jhinga Dum Nisha has the prawn coated in spices. The Gosht Chapli Cabab on their menu comes highly recommended. The meat is minced well, blended with spices employed with thorough cooking.The Makhanwala Ghar Ka Paneer has a smooth buttery tomato gravy that isnt too heavy on the spices, neither is it as oily as conventional paneer sabjis are. The Baingan Bharta too is less oily than what I am used to at home, but I guess the kitchen is adapting to the healthier lifestyle of its guests. The Kukkad Makhanwala is the traditional buttery chicken curry; the meat is well cooked and tastes of a richer version of the conventional Indian masala curry based in tomato puree.I would also like to give a shout out to the Methi Cherra Aloo on the menu. The dish is simplicity personified as deliciousnes. The chef has let the methi and aloo bring its own flavour to the dish, by keeping the spices on check. What a beauty, this was! I would highly recommend you to try this sabji if you visit Coyla. The Dal Makhani is rich and creamy.But if I havent made it more obvious yet, it was indeed the Taftan that stole my heart at this restaurant. It was light, flaky, bubbled well on the corners, soft and just served as the perfect soul food for a rainy evening. The Gulab Jamun was warm, soft and not overtly sweet, topped with pista flakes.So, if you are looking for some soothing comfort food to keep you warm on a rainy evening, head over to Coyla and order yourself some Taftan and Methi Cherra Aloo, Id say.Cost for two: Rs 1,700 (approx)"

Narendra Vaskar Sanjay Nimbalkar and his daughter, Pranjal. Narendra VaskarSANJAY NIMBALKAR (57), a general physician for 34 years, claimed that his skills and experience were tested the most during the nine-hour travel in the Karmali-Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) Tejas Express on Sunday. His biggest challenge was to calm down passengers on board the train, in which 24 passengers had to be admitted to the Life Care hospital in Chiplun after they complained of food poisoning.Nimbalkar, who was travelling in the chair car compartment on Sunday, along with his wife and daughter, recalled the journey when two of the co-passengers complained of nausea and stomach pain. We had just finished with our tomato soup at 12.30 pm when someone came calling out to check if there was any doctor in the train. When my daughter and I told them that we were medical practitioners, we were told about two passengers who complained of stomach pain and nausea. By the time we attended to them, the situation had become intense, said Nimbalkar, who runs his clinic in CBD Belapur in Navi Mumbai.The doctor recalled that when they began attending to the ill passengers, other passengers were already in a state of confusion and panic. While many suggested to halt the train at that given spot, a few even reached to pull the chain in the train, he said. We had just left Ratnagiri railway station when the incident happened. The next halt was at Chiplun railway station, at least two hours away. After giving the required medication to a few passengers who complained of nausea, we realised nothing was going to work on them till they get the required medical care in a hospital. So, we tried our best to convince the passengers that the train needs to run till we reach a specific halt, added Nimbalkar.The father-daughter doctor duo added that they did not have their stethoscopes or other accessories with them as they were returning from a four-day holiday in Goa. By checking the pulse of ill passengers and through analysing their symptoms, Nimbalkar said, they tried to identify the problem and spread a word of caution to others. We saw the relatives of passengers were surrounding those who were ill, suffocating them further. This was followed by switching off the air-conditioner in the coach as many complained of the vomit smell that had spread across coaches. We asked them not to surround the ill passengers and allow them to breath freely, said Nimbalkar. While a few of those taken to the hospital blamed the food served in the train, which they claimed was smelly, the Nimbalkars claimed they were satisfied with the quality of food that was served to them.After the train halted at Chiplun station for two hours, we resumed the journey at 2.30 pm. I had my lunch at around 4.30 pm without having any issue with the quality of food served. Many other passengers too had their lunch, said Nimbalkar. I am not a judge to say whether there was any problem in the food. However, with a less than two minute halt at each station in this train which has automatic doors, passengers can not take a chance to step out at stations and eat. Few of them opt to carry lunch with them. Many will thus opt to eat in the train, hoping the food served is suitable to the price we pay, he added.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Forty of the 294 passengers, travelling to the city from Karmali in Goa on Sunday, were rushed to the Life Care hospital in Chiplun after the train was stopped there. Twenty-four of them had to be admitted to the hospital. But on Monday morning, all of them were discharged and transport arranged to send them to Mumbai, said railway officials.According to senior railway officials, the committee spoke to passengers, the AC mechanic, the train conductor and ticket examiners to find out the reason for the passengers throwing up as the initial suspicion was on the food served on the train. Food on Tejas not reason for passengers taking ill: RailwaysIt emerged that two groups of tourists were travelling in the affected coach, one from Himachal Pradesh and the other from Kolkata. Two children travelling with the group from Himachal Pradesh first vomited in the coach. The smell and sight caused uneasiness among the other passengers and then two more children threw up. Then two more children vomited, triggering a vomiting spree in the compartment, railway officials said.The IRCTC has served a showcause notice to catering contractor J K Ghosh. The area officer of the IRCTC at Madgaon and the onboard manager too were placed under suspension. The inquiry on them is still under way. The caterer has been supplying food in the premium train for three months.A committee comprising the senior divisional commercial manager of the CR, additional chief medical superintendent, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and additional general manager, IRCTC (Western zone), was formed to inquire into the episode. Feedback about the quality of food was taken from passengers, almost all of whom said the food served was satisfactory. Food samples were found to be within their expiry dates, said a statement from the railways.Of the 294 passengers onboard the Tejas Express, 230 were served breakfast consisting of omelette, cutlet, tea, coffee and juice at 9.30 am followed by tomato soup at 12.30 pm. Passengers reported not feeling well from 12.30 pm onwards.The railways statement quotes the tour manager of the group from Kolkata, Kajal Chakravarti, who said there was no problem with the food quality. As many as six passengers of the 16 from the group from Himachal Pradesh and six others from the group of 23 travelling from Kolkata fell ill on the train. Food poisoning could have been caused by food eaten days in advance or by bacterial infection, which can develop days later. This may have triggered the first two cases of vomiting. The uneasiness and smell caused the other passengers to throw up, said a member of the committee.It is true that food poisoning could be caused by bacterial growth after consumption of stale food over a period of days. The same is referred to as gestation and the poisoning may be triggered after consumption of other meals. However, as many as 40 passengers feeling nauseous due to the air-conditioning in the coach is something which should be checked, said Manish Deliwala, a general physician based out of Chembur.The Food and Drug Administration of Maharashtra said they were not sent any food samples from the meals served on the train for testing. The railways has not asked us for any inspection. As per protocol, they have their own food safety officer to test the food samples, said Maharashtra FDA Commissioner Pallavi Darade.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

5a155b8c9855b76bf13ed94f,Eating Bengal,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1171001/jsp/opinion/story_175573.jsp,2017-10-01,"For the non-Bengali like me, Puja tourism is about food. In the early Nineties, when I first began visiting pandals in Chittaranjan Park, I was baffled by the non-doing nature of the main enclosure that hosted the pratima. We seemed always to get there before or after the aarti so to the uninitiated outsider, the setting felt like a prelude to something that never happened. The first time the pandal and the pratima made sense to me as performance was years later while watching the film, Parineeta, when I saw a particularly energetic version of the dhunuchi dance. Except that the principal dancer was Sanjay Dutt and while I'm used to suspending disbelief at the pictures, it was hard to take in Munna Bhai in this new bhadralok avatar without giggling. I think one of the reasons people inspect the pratima so closely is that for the most part, there's so little else to do. I used to pay particular attention to the slain (or in the process of being slain) Mahishasura for the same reason that people watch action movies: for the gore. The first year that I toured the pandals, the Mahishasuras were small, pitiable figures, notable mainly for the bloody wound that Durga's trident had made, but I later encountered large, heavily muscled versions. What they had in common was a haplessness that was oddly moving. Durga herself seemed oblivious to the asura she had killed, as she looked into the middle distance, remotely smiling. It was her lion that seemed properly involved in the slaughter, his bloodied teeth and claws dug into Mahishasura's body which was often a bilious green and who can blame him? The saddest figure in the composition was the discarded buffalo, supine and hollowed out at the base of the tableau, like a filmi extra. My disenchantment with the tableaux had something to do with the fact that the first one I saw had Durga as a dead ringer for Hema Malini. The prig in me was offended: I had come looking for Bengali iconography and had found a still from a Bombay mythological instead. Looking back, though, I can see the point of the likeness: if the artist had been looking to model beatific blandness, he couldn't have done better. It was in the food stalls that I found consolation, in the deep fried, keema-stuffed porotas made out of maida. As someone born and raised in Delhi on first-rate Punjabi parathas, after that first taste of the Bengali version, I couldn't understand why north Indians bothered with aata when maida's elastic chewiness was self-evidently better. The same principle holds for pooris; why not, in a frank, manly way acknowledge superiority and eat luchis instead? The first time I encountered festive Bengali food was in 1983 when I travelled up to Calcutta for a friend's wedding. We stayed with the groom in his parents' house for several days and on the first day we settled down to eat lunch at a very long table flanked by benches. It was a catered meal and I still remember the name of the caterer: Bijoli Grill. We were served rice and dal and mashed potatoes which, in retrospect, I recognize as alu makha but at the time I thought was a kind of alu bharta. The dal was excellent and the sharpness of the mustard oil mixed into the potatoes was a new and adventurous taste. As someone who had been raised a vegetarian before going over to the dark side, I understood dal, chawal and alu and I made a meal of it. I was a little surprised at the plainness of the food, but it was barely noon so I decided it was meant to be a kind of brunch and there were after all, dozens of people to be fed. After stuffing myself, I made to get up and leave. This was awkward because I was sitting on a running bench so the thin young man to my right had to get up as well to make space for me to lever my legs out from under the table. I was midway through this manoeuvre when Mrs Sarkar, Abhijit's mother, materialized in front of me looking concerned. ""Where are you going?"" she asked. ""Is there something wrong with the food?"" I said it was wonderful but I had eaten enough. ""Enough?"" she repeated, baffled. ""But we have just begun!"" I had never eaten a desi meal in courses before. Where I came from you ate your staple - dal, roti, paratha - surrounded by the sabzis and chutneys and raitas and pickles that constituted the meal. An amused Hyderabadi friend once described this to me as 'your katori culture'. So when I was nudged back into my place on the bench, I realized that the wedding guest in Bengal needed to be a long-distance runner. After that initial course, we ate two kinds of fish, rui and ilish. This was followed by a mutton curry which I know now was kosha mangsho. All of this was accompanied by several servings of rice. After we had done with the meat, we moved on to chatni, a tomato chutney mined with dates, raisins and other sweetness that I wasn't sure I liked till I combined it with rice and then it was magical. I was feeling faintly sick by then because I had never eaten so much before and I hadn't paced myself. This was around the time that I began to attend to the thin young man to my right. He was extraordinarily thin, in that hipless, hollow-cheeked way that's special to India. He was virtually two-dimensional. And yet, he made his way through the rui, ilish and mangsho like a human tapeworm, helping himself more than once to each sort of fish and then the mutton and now he was doing a steady free-style through the chatni, never pausing to breathe or burp. We finished with three kinds of mishti; I use 'we' loosely, because I had fallen by the wayside by then. My participation was vicarious; I just watched my neighbour do the treble with ease, this Abebe Bikila of the six-course meal. We ate like this every day, twice a day, for three days. But this, I was assured, was nothing; the pice de rsistance according to the gourmands who surrounded me, was yet to come. These were the king prawns that would be served at the bou bhaat, the reception dinner the day after the wedding. I never got that far; I only ever heard Abhijit's king prawns described because by the evening of the wedding reception, I was a broken man, running a shuttle service to the nearest loo, my digestion destroyed by a regimen of gluttony that asked for more endurance than my north Indian constitution could supply. There is a reason why Abhijit, like many Bengali men, always carries a little pink bottle of Gelusil or its alternative, the orange Aqua Ptychotis. No culture can eat like this without chronic heartburn. But eating was never the same again after that 1983 wedding. I learnt to eat my way through fish heads as they squinted at me, to tease hair-thin bones out of ilish, to lay by enough room for the sweet at the end. When my niece declared the other day that she was going pandal-hopping with friends, I told her to skip the pratimas and home in on the porotas. She was kind enough to report that I was right. It's a simple truth that I learnt three-and-a-half decades ago: Bengali culture is basically food."

I just want the truth to come out.""Mr Banerjee has to report for questioning again tomorrow.He was accused by the woman, a resident of north Bengal, of promising to marry her, cohabiting with her and then dumping her. Her police complaint, filed on October 10, alleges rape. Earlier, she had filed a police complaint at her hometown, Balurghat, and then gone public with intimate photos of the two of them and tweeted to India's vice president, the minister of women welfare and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for help.Mr Banerjee had, however, filed a police complaint on September 6, stating that he had merely tried to help the woman get a student loan and she had tried to blackmail him. He filed an FIR on October 9, a day before she did.In September, just before the case hit the headlines, Mr Banerjee was expelled by his party, the CPM, for a variety of 'personal indiscretions'. His party suspended him in June after it received 19 complaints about alleged ""sexual misconduct"".After the woman's FIR, the CID, given charge of the case, summoned Mr Banerjee twice but he failed to show up. Finally, with the threat of arrest looming over his head, he sought and got anticipatory bail and reported to the police today.The woman is not backing off. Her Twitter status reads, ""Ritabrata is a rapist, womanizer, liar and full of s***. Next time you see him, throw rotten eggs n tomato at him.""Such public exchanges about personal indiscretions are unusual in India, certainly in Indian politics. Though he has been expelled by his party, Mr Banerjee is still a member of the Indian parliament. His term as an 'Independent' ends in 2020."

Ole, I said to myself, and landed up there.The restaurant, called The Beer Caf, is present in many parts of Delhi but has just opened up an outlet in Khan Market. Its in the middle lane, on your right if you enter the lane from the Rabindra Nagar side. The cafe is on the second floor (Phone No. 9711316004).Its a neat place, with a bar on one side, comfortable sofas, tables for dining and a small terrace where you can sit and contemplate nature. There is music playing, but not so loud (as it is in several cafes) that you cannot hear yourself think.They have a Spanish theme, but actually it has a lot of other stuff as well  from dim sums and Bruschetta to pasta, pizza and grilled food and from keema pao and biryani to even peanut chaat.But my mind was on Spain, so I was keen on tapas and such like. A platter of tapas  Spanish finger-food  arrived, with pulled chicken, mustard and scallion herb fish, garlic prawn crostini, caprese, marinated olives, pickled gherkins and fried chillies (Rs. 695).The first dish to arrive was a prawn preparation  gambas al ajillo  prawns sizzled with garlic, chilli, parsley, olive oil and lemon (Rs. 425). Then came the pollo al ajillo  pan-seared garlic chicken thigh, sausages and wings (Rs. 375). And then there was coca-Catalan flatbread  oven-roasted vegetables, roasted tomatoes and fresh herbs (Rs. 325).The tapas were good, and I enjoyed the pulled chicken, the caprese  a piece of soft mozzarella and tomato stick  and the garlic prawn crostini served on a piece of small flat bread.The platter included some basa fish, which I politely refused. Basa, in my opinion, is the fish worlds paneer.The main prawn dish was served on a small slice of lemon, which gave it a nice tangy taste. The main flavours for the chicken and prawn dishes were similar, except that the chicken was chilli-hot. I enjoyed both.I liked the Catalan flatbread quite a bit. One, of course, because of the developments in Catalonia, and, two, because it was a crispy thin-crust bread with some delicious roasted toppings.It is almost like a pizza, but without the mandatory tomato sauce. It came with yellow and red roasted peppers, broccoli, zucchini, aubergines and tomatoes. The veggies were juicy, the bread was crisp, and the two complementary textures jived well together. And what added to the taste was the basil, which left its characteristically piquant flavours on the toppings of the flatbread.It was quite a nice meal, and since I was in The Beer Caf, I had some Belgian beer to go along with the food.However, since the caf has a vast wine collection, I think they should tone down their spices so that the food can complement the wine, and vice versa.But the menu is interesting, the place is comfortable and the food, enjoyable. Muy buen, Id say."

Also, the kosha mangsho at Bhosale Nagar is to die for!'During Pujo, besides festive pleasantries, we can bet that the next most important topic of discussion among Bengalis is what one can eat and where - such is their love for food! Be that as it may, the real charm, however, lies in the simple 'bhog' (an offering to Ma Durga) served during the festival.Close to lunch hours, it's common to see people partaking in the meal on sal leaf or dona plates as dada-boudis and elderly kaku-kakimas attend to them. An honest celebration of community, we couldn't think someone better than 68-year-old Moni Das to tell us more about this divine meal.We meet Moni, the head cook of Pune Kali Bari (one of the city's oldest pujas), in a makeshift mandap beside the pandal. Sporting a checked gamccha, he oversees his team that readies the day's bhog . They stir enormous steel patilas of food, as myriad aromas arise and engulf us. ""We've been cooking since 5 am,"" he tells us. While Moni captains the ship, he has 15 men assisting him, and an additional 10 men packing food parcels for visitors who won't be eating at Pune Kali Bari.Having used over 40 kilos of paneer, 40 kilos of peas, 50 kilos of potatoes, 200 kilos of rice and about 200 litres of milk, Moni assures us that the food will be more than sufficient. ""10 people can have a kilo of bhog'er khichuri. Going by that estimation, we cook according to the day and its expected footfall. Ashtami and Navami see maximum attendance. That's when we cook for 3000-plus people,"" Moni adds. Clearly, catering for so many has become second nature for him, given that he has been cooking for Pune Kali Bari since 1979.The quintessential meal is a simple one, merely representing a lavish Bengali meal for everyone to partake in. Moni tells us that the line-up usually comprises, but isn't restricted to, flavoursome bhog'er khichuri (prepared from special Gobindobhog rice, moong dal and vegetables; except onions and garlic), labra (Bengali-style mixed vegetable), a sweet-tangy date and tomato chutney, beguni (a fried brinjal savoury) followed by payesh (rich Bengali rice kheer). On Saptami, Pune Kali Bari served devotees a Bengali-style pulao, chana dal, aloo-mattar-paneer, chutney and payesh. Today's menu will be the aforementioned standard one.Moni says, ""Panch phoron (five-spice masala) is most important for preparing khichuri, labra and chutney. If it is prepared here, the flavours don't match up to what you get in Bengal. Hence we source the masala and Gobindobhog rice from Kolkata."" Another key element is the bhaja masala gudi (dry-roasted and ground masala) that's added to the khichuri along with ghee before serving.Besides Durga Puja, Moni is busy during other pujas at Pune Kali Bari, namely amavasya puja, Annapurna puja, Saraswati Puja, Laxmi Puja and Kali Puja, to name some. Besides seeking Durga's blessings, he is also reason why many love visiting  to tuck into the familiar, homely meal they look forward to. Rest assured, when you visit today, the taste and flavour will be just like what you relished last year.According to consulting Indologist Urmi Chanda-Vaz , socially, Durga Puja in its present form was started in the early 16th century by Bengal's rajas and zamindars. ""They instituted the festival in their palatial homes as a show of authority or autonomy against the British. Gradually, it became an opportunity to flaunt wealth and social status. They would organise grand feasts and committed acts of charity. The grander the feast, the more the social prestige,"" she says.But the gastronomic excesses are also justified with an emotional narrative. Rina Pradhan, a member of Anandam Association, explains, ""We liken Ma Durga's visit to the arrival of a married daughter to her parent's house. Her spending these five days with us brings immense happiness. She is thus pampered with the most delectable traditional food in the form of bhog."" According to Urmi, the offerings in West Bengal are mostly vegetarian, but the East of Bengal (now Bangladesh) offer the goddess non-vegetarian fare, including meat and fish.'Bhog' means an offering to the goddess. Once she has ritually 'eaten' it, it becomes prasad. And it is this prasad that people eat. It's a misnomer when people say they are going to eat bhog.
