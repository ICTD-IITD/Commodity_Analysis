Under the scheme, Rs 8,000 per acre will be directly credited to bank accounts of farmers who have grown tomato crops. Officials will inspect farms 45 days after tomato seeds are sown, following which the amount will be credited to farmers' accounts.Tomatoes are currently being sold at Rs 50-80 per kilo in Gurgaon and other NCR cities. Seeds for the crop are sown in January and February, and the fruits are ready for harvest by April-May. The agriculture department has set a target of 400 hectares to grow tomatoes in the coming season.On Wednesday, Abhilaksh Likhi, principal secretary to the agriculture department, said a monthly plan should be prepared for the new scheme, and soil testing done at the earliest. ""We've set a target to collect and check 12,707 soil samples in Gurgaon by year-end. So far, we have collected 3,600 soil samples, along with 14 samples of manure, two of pesticides and 24 of seeds,"" said Likhi.In total, around 60,000 soil health cards are expected to be distributed among farmers, which will contain analysis that tells farmers which crop their land is best suited for.Likhi has instructed district officials to implement the scheme properly, so that maximum number of farmers can benefit from it. Officials have been asked to visit villages and farmers' meetings to inform them of the scheme and distribute soil health cards.""Tomato is an important ingredient in most dishes. It gets really expensive this time of the year. I'm hoping this initiative will help regulate prices,"" said Aastha Popli, a marketing executive.""Although I expect tomato prices to come down, it won't fall quickly enough to provide relief to customers. We've had to put up with high tomato prices. This has affected our budget and what we cook. Still, I hope prices go down soon,"" said Shabnam Kohli, a Sushant Lok resident."

Picture by Prashant Mitra Inundation of several roads and bridges is threatening to snap the supply of essential commodities, including fruits and vegetables, to Ranchi and jack up prices in the wholesale and retail markets. Sources in the transport circuit said a bridge over Koel river in Basia, Gumla, went underwater on Wednesday, leaving 100trucks bound for the capital stranded at various locations. Similarly, rainwater flowing over a bridge near Bero in Mandar block has halted the supply of essentials coming from Lohardaga and Daltonganj (Palamau). ""The Ranchi-Simdega road, which extends till Odisha, is out of bounds for traffic since the Koel bridge was inundated. We have suspended all buses (around 30) to Simdega and beyond. At least 100trucks bringing supplies from different states are stranded,"" said Kishore Mantri, the general secretary of Ranchi Bus Owners' Association. Mantri added that vehicular movements on Ranchi-Lohardaga and Ranchi-Daltonganj routes were as badly hit. Suresh Kumar, who drives a bus on Ranchi-Daltonganj stretch, said a portion of a small bridge near Pakhria in Chanho on NH-75 was witnessing erosion. ""Portions of the bridge have become very narrow, leading to long snarls. More rain can snap this link too,"" he said. On Ranchi-Hazaribagh-Patna route (NH-33), a landslide threat has emerged near Chuttupalu valley in Ramgarh after heavy rain loosened boulders. The Ranchi-Bokaro road via Sikidiri and Ranchi-Silli road are also out of bounds owing to flooding of a bridge and road cave-in in Silli two days ago. Sunil Chauhan, vice-president of Ranchi Goods Transporters Association, said consignments from Bengal had remained affected for two-three days. ""Potatoes, vegetables and flowers come from Bengal and other states to Ranchi via Baharagora, and this link has taken a beating. Vegetable prices are likely to rise,"" Chauhan said, adding that roughly 100 trucks brought essential items to Ranchi and more than 50 were stranded. A senior official of a retail supermarket chain said for three days now, they were facing crisis of vegetables. ""Our stocks come from Silli and Gola, but many roads and bridges have been washed away along the route, and there is no supply. In Brambe (on Ranchi's outskirts), where we do bulk procurement, local markets are closed owing to incessant rain. We are somehow managing with vegetables bought from Pithoria,"" he said, adding that almost all their outlets in Ranchi and Jamshedpur were facing the crunch. ""For our 50-odd stores in Ranchi and Jamshedpur, we require 10 tonnes of vegetables a day, but are doing with less than half the stocks."" The humble potato will soon be too hot to handle, the supermarket official warned. ""Potatoes mostly come from Bengal. As per norms, they are first dried after being taken out of cold storage before being dispatched. Heavy rain in Bengal has hit stocks,"" he said. In retail markets, the price of tomato has shot up to Rs 120 notwithstanding the state food and civil supplies department's order to FJCCI to cap the rate at Rs 80. Green vegetables like beans and cauliflower are acting pricey too. Beans are selling at Rs 30 per 250gm while a small cauliflower also has a price tag of Rs 30.

What is a garden without insects ? Its like life without problems! The most common insects that can create havoc are mealy bugs, aphids and spider mites.Leaf Miner: These minute insects form lines on the leaves. They usually dont harm the plant much, but its advisable to discard the leaves, else they can affect the whole plant.Mealy bugsThese are soft cottony looking insectsAphidsThese are tiny dark coloured insects.Aphids and mealy bugs can spread very quickly if not detected at an early stage. They are sap sucking insects and are mostly found on the stem and branches and at the back side of the leaves.Spider mitesAre extremely tiny insects and usually found on the underside of the leaves. They form web like structure and make holes through the leaf.Some common remedies are described belowAlthough organic pesticides are tempting, water jet spray and wiping with hand is a better option to clean off the insects from the plant. A jet spray from the watering hose pipe is very effective compared to spraying from a bottle. Give the affected part of the plant a complete wash. Wait for a few days and see if they come back. Give a second wash if necessary. Following are some alternative options in case the pests returns:Neem oil : Add 20 ml of neem oil and 5 drops of liquid handwash to 1 litre of water. Mix it well and spray generously all over the affected parts of the plant. The liquid handwash helps the neem oil to stick on the plants and protect it.3G formula : Grind 100g each of ginger, green chillies and garlic to paste. Take 5 ml of this paste and mix with one litre water and spray. Use once in 10 days.Wood Ash : Sprinkle wood ash on the plant, preferably from wood that has not been chemically treated. You can also sprinkle homa ash on the affected leave and around the top soil of the pot.Once you have an attack of aphids and luck shines upon you, a very friendly visitor, the ladybug or lady beetle may appear to feast on these aphids. Other insects / reptiles such as lizards and grasshoppers also help in controlling the pest population in a garden.Another indicator of an aphid infection is the presence of ants on the plant. Ants do not directly harm the plants, but they help spreading and protecting the mealybugs and the aphids. The mealybugs and aphids take off nutrition from the plants and the ants then feed on them. So once you see ants on your plants, there is a good chance that there is something buggy going on. Most of these insects will be on the back side of the leaves, so it is difficult to spot them.Some gardeners spray the neem oil mix (as mentioned above) on a regular basis. But this is usually not a good option since it works like taking a paracetamol in advance to prevent from falling sick. Instead , it is suggested to spend time on making the soil rich enough that it has good amount of nutrition to keep the plant healthy and be able to fight pests.Just like humans and animals fall sick, so do plants. This usually happens when plants are weak due to lack of nutrition or care. Providing nutrition on a regular basis helps the plant growth. For example, a tomato plant takes about 1.5 months to start flowering. Till this point of time, the nutrition present in the initial potting mix is used up. The plant needs more nutrition during the flowering and fruiting period. So starting from the flowering stage, provide additional nutrition to the plant. Some methods of enriching the soil are below:Leaf MinerThese minute insects form lines on the leaves. They usually dont harm the plant much, but its advisable to discard the leaves, else they can affect the whole plant.Stem/shoot/fruit borerThese insects basically lay their eggs in the stem or the fruit of the plant. As the caterpillar develops, it destroys the fruit/stem. Most commonly seen on gourds and brinjals. Phermone traps can be used to trap these insects.Different types of CompostRemove approx 1 inch of the top layer of the soil and 1-2 handfuls of compost and cover with the soil again. General recommendation is to do this once in 2 weeks. Make sure that you do not disturb the root structure.Liquid fertilisers like Panchgavya (PG) and Jeeva Amrut (JA) help in quick nutrient absorption from the soil. PG and JA are usually available with folks who have cows (preferably desi cows) in their farms. Making them is a rather long process and the ingredients are not easily available for an average urban gardener. Hence they usually prefer to buy these instead of making them on their own.TIPWhen opening the PG bottle for the first time, make sure you direct the opening away from you and slowly twist open the cap in an open place. Else it may fizz out like a cola drink! For first timers, PG smells can be intimidating.Jeevamruta (JA)is similar to PG, but with lesser ingredients viz, cow urine, cow dung, jaggery, besan (bengal gram) powder and untouched top soil. The microbial activity n JA is at it peak around the 3rd/4th day of preparation. Check with supplier for when to use & dilution details.Panchgavya (PG) : is made out of five ingredients and hence its name  cow dung, cow urine, cow milk, ghee and curd. Bananas and jaggery are also added. To use PG, one needs to dilute 20-30 ml of PG into 1 liter of water and water the plants with this diluted mix. There might be slight variation in how PG is prepared, so check with the supplier about dilution details and its life. On an average, one can use it once in a month."

Visitors kept away from the market which was inundated by Monday's rainfall.Traders blamed the water stagnation on the failure of the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) to clear the path for rainwater to drain into the Cooum river. Rainwater from the market complex drains into the Cooum through a channel near Daniel Thomas Matriculation School on Poonamallee High Road ""Despite repeated requests, CMDA refused to clear the water channel. Even worse, about four acres of land near the school has been bought by a restaurant chain which has blocked the area. If the restaurant is allowed to come up, it will permanently seal the channel,"" said advisor to the Koyambedu Vegetable Market Wholesale Traders Association, V R Soundararjan. ""Footfall reduces every monsoon due to poor maintenance of the market complex. Authorities must ensure that traders dump vegetable waste only in bins. Fogging must be carried out regularly to control mosquito breeding in the market complex,"" he said.Traders said prices of vegetables have gone up due to heavy rainfall that damaged crops in Karnataka and western Tamil Nadu . Only the price of potato, which costs Rs 15-18 per kilogram, has remained stable since the last few weeks. The price of tomato rose from Rs 20/kg to Rs 40/kg while that of beans has gone up from Rs 30/kg to Rs 50/kg. Carrot, which was sold for Rs 30 two weeks ago, is now being sold for Rs 50/kg. The price of cabbage has gone up from Rs 15/kg to Rs 40, and so has that of drumstick from Rs 60/kg to Rs 100."

Situated beside a granary in Chawri Bazar, it has been serving fruit sandwiches since 1948.The sandwiches, with apple, chiku, pineapple, and grape stuffed between slices of white bread, are a delicacy you will probably not find anywhere else in the Capital.The basic ingredients of each fruit sandwich, besides the fruit, are white cream, home-made paneer and sugary kesar chutney. Some of the specialties are seasonal, but the rule doesnt apply to all seasonal produce. The mango sandwich, for instance, is available round the year. They also serve toasted sandwiches with a simple filling of tomatoes and cucumber.The area where the Jain Coffee House is located has a colourful history. It was a red-light district during the Mughal era. Serious-minded city explorers, however, visit the area to photograph crumbling old balconies and try delicious streetside, vegetarian-only snacks such as aloo tikkis, gol-gappas and bedmi puri.If you dont have a taste for fruit sandwiches, you might like the savoury namkeen sandwich layered with paneer, tomato slices, pomegranate seeds, and flavoured with coriander leaves and light spices.The dimly lit coffee house is owned by a family of grain merchants from north Delhis Kanhaiya Nagar. A few assistants spend the day placing sliced tomatoes on slices of white bread. Its founder, Lala Shambhu Dayal Jain, had migrated to the city from Shikarpur in western Uttar Pradesh.The coffee house also serves fruit shakes. But you should wash down the sandwiches with its excellent ginger-flavoured chai.Sadly, Jain Coffee House doesnt have patience for people who like to sit for hours over a single cup of coffee. A Hindi-language notice on the wall warns the customer not to waste our time by idling in the shop."

Mummy would look after us seven siblings. We all grew up in a one-room home.The household budget was always tight and Ms Hemrajani remembers that each kid would receive exactly two meat pieces in their biryani, whenever it was cooked. The fact that her father always bought sava-kilo meat is so deeply imprinted in her memory that to this day she also buys the same quantity of mutton.Every weekend mummy would bake caramel pudding which would be served only to Daddy.Ms Hemrajani is making Daal Pakwan for us today because its simple to make and my friends love this dish and it makes for a great Sunday brunch.We must add that Ms Hemrajani is helped in the kitchen by Sushila, who has been working with her for 10 years.INGREDIENTSOne cup chana daal (soaked for 3-4 hours)2 green chillies1 medium tomato cut into 2 piecesHaldiSaltFOR TEMPERING2 tsp Ghee1 tsp Amchur1 tsp Dhania powder1 tsp Jeera1/2 tsp Red chilliACCOMPANIMENTSChopped onionGreen coriander mint chutneyMeethi tamarind chutneyFOR PAKWAN1 cup whole wheat flour (or maida)1/2 tsp ajwainOil for fryingMETHODBoil chana dal in a pressure cooker with chopped chillies, tomatoes, haldi and salt.Once cooked, remove the skin of the tomatoes, and mix them whole in the daal.Transfer the dal into a bowl.

The agriculture ministry thinks so and is hunting for commercially viable proposals in 12 pre-identified areas.The Narendra Modi governments Startup India scheme, which has a Rs10,000 crore war chest managed by the Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi), is seeking to incubate farm-solution startups through a contest called Agriculture Grand Challenge.I urge young entrepreneurs to participate in our newly launched Agriculture Grand Challenge and join forces to make agrarian sector technologically sound and commercially viable, farm minister Radha Mohan Singh said. The idea is to enable entrepreneurship and innovation, he said.A handful of startups for the rural economy are already a part of the growing ecosystem. India has more than 19,000 startups, led by consumer Internet and financial services apps, according to the Economic Survey 2015-16.From 220 in 2014, the number of startups funded in the first 10 months of 2017 stood at 482, according to data from Tracxn.As of December 2015, eight Indian startups belonged to the so-called Unicorn category, a club of ventures valued at $1 billion or more. Yet, fewer than 10% of these cater to the farm or social sector, according to Tracxn.A government document, which Hindustan Times has reviewed, states that private-sector startups could offer viable interventions in an array of areas, notably linking farmers to markets and offering extension services. It seeks to rev up an emerging niche area thats being dubbed as farming as a service, or FAAS.Proposals are being invited for simplified, sensor-based quick testing of soil samples as well as real-time assaying and grading of food commodities in electronically linked eNAM markets. The government has linked 470 mandis electronically but many of them lack crucial infrastructure: food labs to test samples being brought to these markets. The prospective app should preferably enable sample tests under two minutes to promote online trade.The government is interested in apps to connect food processors with agripreneurs and growers, an official said. To help price discovery, the ministry is looking at price forecast apps for pulses, oilseeds, potato, onion and tomato at the time of sowing since these crop are vulnerable to price volatility.According to the document, the success of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Indias main farm insurance scheme, depends on accurate yield estimates at village and farm levels for which it wants to incubate digital technologies.Another priority area is custom hiring of farm machinery and cheaper disposal of crop residue that has become a major reason for pollution in the national capital from neighbouring states during winters.Under the programme, commercially viable ideas will be incubated at the governments expense for three months. The last date for applications is January 15, 2018.Given the high penetration of Internet-enabled mobile phones, this is a good idea that can drive down cultivation costs, said Ashok Duggal, one of the promoters of VentureIndia Labs.A crop of startups aimed at harnessing the rural economy has made inroads already. AgroStar, a Pune-based mobile-commerce firm, directly sells farm inputs to farmers in Maharashtra and has raised more than $4 million. Farmers need to give a missed call to access its services.EM3, another firm, offers farm-labour services at Rs 2,000 an acre of wheat, which it claims is half of what it normally costs during peak season.The government document said it would prefer solutions that are scalable and can reach small farmers.The average size of farm holdings is 1.15 hectares. This means nearly 85% farmers are small and marginal. India has 120 million agricultural land holdings."

Barely three weeks back, 30 to 40 per cent of tomato crops were reportedly damaged.With low-pressure induced overcast condition prevailing in the region for the past five to six days, the temperature variations have enhanced the breeding capacities of pests and fungus. Due to this, vegetable plants are witnessing rotting of leaves and stems, horticulture officers said.While tomatoes, brinjal, cabbage and cauliflower plants have been witnessing the initial stages of fungus and pest attacks, so far reports of attack on capsicum havent cropped up, they added.I have cultivated cauliflower and cabbage over half-an-acre and tomato on another acre. However, signs of pest and fungus attacks have been detected on the standing crop, Manuel Xalxo, a farmer of Karimati village, said.Panposh Assistant Director of Horticulture (ADH) S P Nayak said the the department was keeping a close watch on the situation. We are advising farmers to start blanket spraying of pesticide and fungicide twice a week and later reduce it to once a week, he said.Nuagaon Block Chairman Maklu Ekka, who himself is a farmer, said spraying of pesticide and fungicide would not help until there is adequate sunlight.Small and marginal farmers are facing the real problem as after investing in kharif paddy crops, they have turned to vegetable crops. However, they do not have money for spraying pesticide and fungicide, horticulture officials added.The Block Chairman said areas including Joketa, Goldaru, Karimati,Barilepta, Garda, Sorda, Katepur, Banki, Jhariatola and Limda were reeling under incidents of pest attacks on tomatoes, cabbages and cauliflower crops."

I peered around in my womens hostel room and found there was no power as well.I tried to catch some sleep till 6 am, after which I started calling fellow hacks to find out if they faced a similar situation and if they knew when electricity supply would be restored. All of them appeared equally clueless.the Palaiyaru Road in NagercoilCommunication then became a worry as both my mobile phone and the power bank only had half battery charge. The signal from the mobile phone tower was also weak and intermittent. A few hours later, I walked down the street to see if any shops or hotels were open to grab a bite.There was none. With rain pouring down the streets, I knew I couldnt travel long distances. And the streets were either choked with traffic or blocked by collapsed trees.By afternoon, information had trickled in about cyclone Ockhi and I knew we had to be prepared for the worst. I met up other reporters and found all bachelors in the group hadnt had a morsel of food since morning, like me.I quickly filed an initial report to my office, but reaching officials for updates or verification of information was impossible as calls didnt go through.Friends suggested I go home, which is just two hours from Nagercoil. At 5 pm, I left by a bus but reaching my hometown in Tirunelveli district took over three hours as fallen vegetation all along the route made the vehicle crawl.After reaching home, hunger got a whole new definition in my mind as I had the first piece of chappati of the day.On Friday morning after making a few calls, I realised some of my fellow reporters still hadnt had any food. My mother quickly prepared packets of chappati with tomato side dish and lemon rice, which has a longer shelf life.Reaching the city was again tedious but I somehow made it and shared the food with the hungry reporters. We were back at work. One dreadful and eventful day had passed.
