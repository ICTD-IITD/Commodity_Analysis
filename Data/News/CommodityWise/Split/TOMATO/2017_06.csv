Manimegalai, a home maker from Puliyakulam whose family budget is dependent only on her husbands income, increase in the price of some of the vegetables has led to changes in the daily expenditure.The weekly Uzhavar Santhai used to be a boon for mid and low income families. Now, farmers who sell vegetables directly have also increased prices citing changes in retail market. Hike in the price of coconut has forced us to replace thengai chutney with sambar or thakkali chutney . Luckily, price of tomato has not increased as much as it shot up in July, said Ms. Manimegalai. Quoting some of her neighbours, she said families are buying vegetables in bulk and storing them in refrigerator when prices are low.A vendor from a neighbourhood grocery store near Sivaram Nagar said that sale of vegetables has come down as as she was, with no option left, already selling them at a few paise/rupee higher than the price of vegetables at bigger retail stores.For vegetable buyers in the city, prices of small onions, coconuts, and tomatoes have shot up during the last few days, making many reluctant to buy these. Even in the weekly markets, the prices are high. I have stopped buying small onions, says Jothimani, a resident of Ramanathapuram.Prices of small onions is expected to hover around Rs. 120-140 for another two to three months and prices of tomatoes will come down in a fortnight, said M.R. Palanisamy, Deputy Director of Agriculture Marketing here.According to M. Rajendran, president of Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants Association, small onion prices might touch Rs. 200 a kg in the retail market. This is mainly because of drought last year and recent heavy unseasonal rains in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Farmers are not benefiting from the price rise.The wholesale price of small onions is about Rs. 140. If we used to get 2,000 bags of small onions in the market a day, it has dwindled to 200 bags now. Coconut prices are up because trees dried in Pollachi area and many have cut down the trees because of drought earlier this year. It will take another three months for arrivals to pick up.Prices of most of the vegetables are above Rs. 50 a kg. It will take one or two months for the prices to stabilise. Farmers who cultivated small onions on about 950 hectares in Thondamuthur area saw a bumper crop this season. They did not get a good price last month.Traders and farmers who had stored small onions were getting good prices now, said trade and official sources.The prices were between Rs. 60 and Rs. 100 last week and increased to Rs. 115 to Rs. 120 now in the wholesale market.The retail price at Uzhavar Santhai on Wednesday was between Rs. 130 and Rs. 135. Bulk buying by the traders for exporting to Middle-East countries might also be a reason for the price rise, said Mr. Palanisamy.However, the prices of country tomato which was just about Rs. 30-a-kg last week has increased to Rs. 35- 38 per kg in Uzhavar Santhais on Wednesday. The prices of tomato is expected to come down in a fortnight, when farmers in Madukkarai block will begin harvest. Tomato was cultivated in 370 hectares in Madukkarai block and 80 hectare in other blocks in Coimbatore district, he said.Farmers Association (Tamilaga Vivasayeegal Sangam) secretary P. Kandasamy said farmers decided when to sell produce based on their needs than on market price.Most often the market intelligence reports were of little help to them as they did not, so far, factor in movement of produce from other States to the city.Having seen prices crash in local markets due to arrival of vegetables from other States, the local farmers had begun taking their needs into account to sell produce.The Government should ensure farmers get a stable price throughout the season, Mr. Rajendran said.(with inputs from R. Arivanantham, Karthik Madhavan, Wilson Thomas, and M. Soundariya Preetha)"

The prices began rising over a month ago and old onions (the red variety usually procured from onion-growing belts in Maharashtra) cost even more now.In the retail market of Mysuru, onions cost between Rs. 50 and Rs. 60 a kg. Larger onions cost even more and the premium quality fetches Rs. 5 more per kg. Meanwhile, the hybrid variety of tomato is being sold at Rs. 55 a kg while the local variety is fetching between Rs. 40 and Rs. 45.At the Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS) outlets here, onions are being sold at Rs. 55 a kg and tomatoes at Rs. 40 a kg.HOPCOMS managing director Anand told The Hindu that onion prices in the wholesale market of the APMC here have gone up, forcing retailers to revise their selling price. The purchase price of onion is Rs. 40 a kg, plus 5% tax. Despite the spiralling prices, we are selling onions at our outlets with a wafer-thing profit margin. Even the price of tomatoes has remained on the higher side, with the selling price hovering around Rs. 40 a kg, he said.Datta, manager at a HOPCOMS procurement centre, said there has been a drop in supply of onions from the major onion markets in north Karnataka and Maharashtra. This is following a fall in production owing to untimely rains.We have no agreement with the farmers on onion procurement. Therefore, we procure them directly from the wholesale dealers at the APMC [yard]. We pay them according to the days market rate with tax, he said.A cashier at a grocery shop in I Block of Ramakrishna Nagar said customers keep asking why the prices have skyrocketed and why they have not stabilised even after so many days."

Chandrababu Naidu as a visionary for transforming Hyderabad as a prominent IT hub during his stint at the helm during the undivided Andhra Pradesh, Mr. Shekhawat said he had no doubt that Mr. Naidu, with focus on implementing various technologies in agriculture, would be responsible for making it highly profitable 25 years later.He said that Andhra Pradesh ranked No. 1 in the country in production of seafood, mangoes, aquaculture, eggs, turmeric, chilli, and tomatoes. He said the Centre was keen to launch some pilot projects in the State going by its impressive track record in implementing several schemes. On the Prime Ministers call for new India, Mr. Shekhawat said that Mr. Naidu was taking steps to redeem his dream to double the income of the farmers by 2022.ExportsStating that there was a need to increase exports, he said only 10% of agriculture produce was being sent abroad. Indias agriculture production was valued at Rs. 98,000 crore. Due to non-availability of post-harvest management technologies, wastage is causing a huge loss, he observed.Mr. Shekhawat called upon the farmers to diversify from traditional paddy and wheat cultivation to other high-value crops by following an integrated approach.Regretting that the average land holding of the farmers was just 0.8 hectare, to the exception of the most prosperous farming States such as Punjab and Haryana, he said it was imperative to introduce schemes to increase their income.Focus on infraIn his address, Mr. Naidu said their focus was on improving pre and post harvest technologies, and develop infrastructure to ensure better price to farmers by building cold chains, godowns, road connectivity, and strengthening market linkages. He said, as the consumer preference was changing fast, they wanted the farmers to change their approach to market-driven cultivation for sustainability.Ministers S. Chandramohan Reddy, Adinarayan Reddy, and Ganta Srinivasa Rao, MPs K. Haribabu, Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao, C.M. Ramesh, and Konakalla Narayana were present."

5aeae2fd9855b7179ad6f788,Wisdom from the heart and hearth,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/wisdom-from-the-heart-and-hearth/article21042217.ece,2017-11-29,,The Hindu,"Contrary to general perception, those devoted to arts and culture do not live as islands. This is precisely what the worldwide tour Bhairav Se Bhairavi Tak being undertaken by renowned vocalists, Pandit Rajan and Sajan Mishra, which commenced from Varanasi recently, signifies. We were seized of the ongoing violence and terrorism world over, which only harms humanity without serving any purpose. Wondering what to do, we decided to propagate peace and brotherhood through our music, explains Rajan Mishra as we settle down for a quiet lunch at Shangri-Las Eros Hotels Tamra restaurant. Agreeing Sajan Mishra, adds, music has tremendous power to move human hearts.We ask for green tea to be followed by som tam, the Thai papaya salad. The staff suggests tomato and bocconcini sandwich to which they readily agree. As in music where we keep exploring ragas, we also experiment with food too, quips Sajan Mishra.Power of musicOne wonders as to how music can help? The entire planet and nature is enveloped in music. Our voice is sound or swara and the heart and pulse beats are layas. Nobody is beyond music as it strikes a chord with all living beings instantly. In fact, the whole cosmic energy moves in rhythm. We have formed rapport through music with even those who do not know our language. In Paris, the audience approached us for autographs with tears rolling down their eyes. Such is the power of melody, relates Rajan Mishra.Sajan Mishra cites the example of their concert at Maastricht, Holland, where audience did not clap. Wondering what went wrong, we were later informed by them that they did not want to disturb the harmony created by the music. That is one of the best compliments we have been paid ever.Has singing given them tranquillity? Besides name and fame, it has given a spiritual dimension to our life making us at peace. Be it riyaaz or concert, we remember Goddess Saraswati and our forefathers and seek their blessings and start. Closing our eyes we are lost and sing to our satisfaction ensuring the audience follows and they do. Recently at Delhi Universitys Shivaji College, we sang for three hours without any student leaving the hall.Driving home the point, Sajan Mishra recalls that once they rushed from a Ganesh Utsav recital at Pune to Mumbai to catch a flight to Malaga in Spain for another show. We did not sleep a wink. Reaching the venue, we splashed water and changed into fresh clothes. We were bone tired yet on the stage with tanpura and tabla as accompaniments, we felt no fatigue and gave a memorable performance.So will this whirlwind tour involve long concerts encompassing all ragas from Bhairav to Bhairavi. Sajan Mishra expounds: We are talking about the whole spectrum and bouquet of ragas and not necessarily from early morning to evening. In lots of places, there are issues concerning audience, auditorium, timings, or security and so keeping those in mind we have worked out various permutations and combinations to bring fore the flavour of ragas. In Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Delhi and Bengaluru, we are doing two concerts, morning and evening just as in Houston. In London we will start at 1 p.m. Adding Rajan Mishra says, Bhairav is an important raga which is sung at dawn just when sun rays start dissipating darkness, has mircotones of Rishabh and Dhaiwat being used. There are several types of Bhairav like Lalit, Ahir, Bairagi and Nat. Bhairavi, a ragini of Bhairav, uses many surs and shudh surs and brings down curtain on a performance. His short demo of the two have heads turning around in awe and admiration.With sandwich and salad being laid, we take a break. Tasting them, the two approve much to the delight of the staff. Bahut achha hai, remarks Rajan Mishra, who loves food and is eager to taste all things new. I like almost all regional cuisines, be it Gujarati, Rajasthani, Uttar Pradesh, Punjabi or South Indian. My favourites include dal-chawal, khichdi, khandvi, undhiyu, rohu fish, bhaat-jhol, dosa, idli, paniharam and appam. Food like music is a labour of love and brings happiness, satisfaction and peace to one making as well as eating. Sajan Mishra, prefers food from UP, Rajasthan and Punjab. They are rich in taste. These regions offer great variety like dal bati choorma, kachhi methi ki and sangria ki subzis, different parathas and dahi.When asked if he cooks, Rajan Mishra replies promptly: Mujhe toh nimbu bhi katna nahi ata. He quietly lets it slip in that Sajan Mishra is a fabulous cook reputed for his dal and chicken preparations. I never had formal training and dont depend on recipes. Having observed my mother and chachi, I started out when we had to fend on our own in Delhi many years ago. Recalling what I had observed, my first attempt yielded delicious dal and gobhi subzi. The bhindi I did not realise had to be washed before being cut. It didnt get cooked despite several helpings of ghee and oil. Our friend sarod player, Ashok Roy and his wife, dropped in. They enjoyed dal and gobhi and quietly ate the bhindi without any comment, quips Sajan Mishra.Such is his love for food that at Vlodrop, Holland, during a tour organised by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, on finding the food placid, Sajan Mishra, decided to use some tadka in the dal and vegetables. I purchased ginger, garlic, chillies and other condiments and decided to use the electric kettle. About to start, Maharishis nephew Girish dropped in unexpectedly. Getting the fragrance, he remarked, Can we also have some of this, and I said join the party. Once, Ritesh, my nephew, requested for kadhi, which I had never made before. With everything ready, I used the curd in the fridge and later the whole place was filled with a strong aroma of strawberry. Investigating I found myself staring at the red kadhi as I had used strawberry curd. Quietly, I dumped it far away. No wonder, they say, raag rasoi pagdi kabhi kabhi bandh jaye (music, food and pagdi sometimes turns to be excellent), he chuckles loudly.On a serious note, Rajan Mishra, is appalled with the burden of studies on children these days. In our time, we studied, played, indulged in pranks and also bunked to watch movies. They couldnt be serious. We had been caught and punished too. Our gurus, grandfather, Bade Ram Das Ji Mishra, father, Hanuman Prasad Mishra and uncle, Gopal Prasad Mishra insisted that sports is required to keep fit and healthy. They insisted on complete concentration, singing with heart and soul instead of treating it as a drill. That helped us to do well in studies too. While Rajan Mishra has a masters degree in sociology, Sajan Mishra graduated from Banaras Hindu University.With great masters at constant attendance, it must have been advantageous. Yes, we were helped by nature and nurture but they never favoured us. The taalim was without fear or favour. They instructed us to listen to other great masters and imbibe their qualities. So we learnt the grasp on sur from Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, while Ustad Vilayat Khan, sitar maestro taught us that the tempo of laya and taan should always synchronise, replies Rajan Mishra.New generation singersTalking about the new generation of singers, Rajan Mishra says, They are extraordinarily talented. All they need is stay away from diversions like mobile, television, internet and computer. Forgetting about updating Facebook, they need to concentrate on studies and music. Rajan Mishra loves to teach while Sajan Mishra fills in his absence. Main unko workout karata hoon, bhai sahib daud lagwate hain (I give workout while brother makes them run), he jests making Rajan Mishra smile.With the brothers declining desserts, one wonders if is a precautionary measure? No, we love khoye ki mithai, sandesh, Banarasi jalebi and sohan halwa, replies Rajan Mishra, and as for precaution, you will be surprised we eat everything. Finding me surprised, he says, Eating is closely related to psychology. The moment you think gol gappa pani will affect the throat, it will. We eat everything bindaas  chutni, aachar, papad, chaat, bhel puri, dahi bhalla, pav bhaji, sev puri, ice creams and drink chilled water. It has never affected our voice. Sajan Mishra adds, Riyaaz cleans up everything. Did you know Begum Akhtar used to eat paan and drink ice water but her voice remained golden.Nobody is beyond music as it strikes a chord with all living beings instantly. In fact, the whole cosmic energy moves in rhythmRajan Mishra"

Traders said tomatoes cost Rs. 40 per kg due to shortage in supply, while onions were at Rs. 35 per kg. Rising prices of both vegetables over the past four weeks has inconvenienced both consumers and sellers alike, traders said.Officials at the APMC said both crops were hit by unseasonal rain, pushing the wholesale prices of tomato to between Rs. 30 and Rs. 40 per kg, and to between Rs. 50 and Rs. 60 in retail outlets. Onion prices, too, went up, selling in retail for Rs. 50 to Rs. 60, depending on quality and location. With the onion crop severely hit in Karnataka, the neighbouring State is depending almost completely on supply from Nashik. Of the 300 trucks of onions entering Bengaluru APMC, over 250 are from Nashik.Ashok Walunj, former director, onion and potato division, APMC, said supply has improved since Wednesday. Around 245 trucks of onion arrived on Thursday and Friday, pushing prices down. Were expecting a fresh stock of onions on Monday. This will bring down the rates further. Within a weeks time, rates will regularise to Rs. 15 to Rs. 20.Tomato, which usually costs between Rs. 18 to Rs. 25 per kg, was being sold at Rs. 45 per kg at the APMC on Friday. Shankar Pingle, former director, vegetables division, APMC, said. Usually, the tomato season starts by mid-October, bring prices down. This time, the tomato crop has been affected by rains in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh in September. During the same time last year, tomatoes cost Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 per kg.Anil Rai, who is among the top tomato dealers in the market, said, On an average, 100 trucks would come to the APMC, each bearing 10 tonnes of tomatoes. This would be distributed across Mumbai Metropolitan Region. However, no supply at all from Karnataka has affected us the most. Whatever is coming to the market is from nearby districts including Nashik, Pune and Satara, but it isnt enough. As per APMC records, the vegetables division received around 40 vehicles of tomatoes on Friday.Mr. Rai added that as the tomato crop cycle is of 90 days, farmers have sown again and this produce is expected in the next 15 to 20 days. This will bring down rates further."

The farmers said that the elephants had been seen in the vicinity of of Agasthya Foundation zone during the last three days, despite the efforts of the forest personnel to drive them back deep inside the forests.The villagers said that the herd camped in Mallappakonda hillock region in Gudupalle mandal, criss-crossing the borders of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Farmers, who grow the crops of tomato, beans and ragi, are a worried lot.The forest personnel have tracked the movement of the herd, which would reconnoiter the fields at nights. Trackers were also arranged in an effort to prevent them from invading human habitations at the forest fringe villages.Divisional Forest Officer T. Chakrapani said that the forest officials from Kuppam rushed to the spot, and drove back the elephants.Meanwhile, heavy rains in Koundinya wildlife sanctuary in Chittoor district, and in the thick forests of V.Kota, Ramakuppam in Kuppam constituency and its adjoining Maharaja Kadai forests in Tamil Nadu in September and October have resulted in sufficient water sources and fodder to the wild elephants criss-crossing the tri-State junction.The forest officials said that during the six months, the problem has been reduced to a minmum, thanks to congenial climate to the wildlife. All the check-dams and ponds in the reserve forests abutting the tri-State junction are brimming with water. The question of fodder crisis will also unlikely to arise in the near future.In spite of the satisfactory scenario in the deep forests, the elephants are known for raiding crops, lured by the paddy and sugarcane fields. Three years ago, the officials counted the figure of wild elephants in tri-State junction at 34. In 2015, three elephants, including a calf, died due to electrocution and confinement. Generally, the movement of wild elephants criss-crossing Kuppam, Ramakuppam, Gudupalle and Shantipuram towards neighbouring Karnataka and Tamil Nadu becomes a phenomenon between November and January, with reports of extensive crop damages."

One such project is the Madurai-Bodinaickanur broad gauge conversion project.The Railways has started work on building subways and bridges on this 90-km line that passes through Usilampatii, Andipatti and Theni. The Madurai-Bodi line is one of the two metre gauge lines in the State yet to be converted to BG, the other being Thiruthuraipoondi-Agasthiampalli line.When the last MG train was operated on December 31, 2010, commuters and villagers gave an emotional farewell to the train right from Madurai to Bodi and back. At that time, these people had fond hopes of one day soon travelling on direct trains to Chennai, Bengaluru and other cities without travelling all the way to Dindigul or Madurai.But, in the following years, their hopes were dashed when the project was put on cold storage while the Southern Railway concentrated on Shencottah-Kollam, Dindigul-Palakkad/Podanur and Karaikudi-Tiruvarur BG conversion projects.But for vociferous protests by trade bodies, elected representatives - former and current - in Madurai and Theni districts, the Bodi project could have been shelved as non-viable.When I was posted in Bodi, I used to take my family by train from Nagamalai Pudukottai station often. Our Brownie would travel in the dog box. Everybody used to enjoy the journey, said T.S. Rajaiah, former Joint Director of Agriculture. He recalled that when Pandiyan Roadways Corporation took over the reins from TVS and increased the fare to 35 paise from 5 paise, 10 paise tickets, people switched loyalty to the Bodi train to travel to Madurai.A. Michael of SS Colony, retired Locomotive Pilot who drove the last MG train from Madurai to Bodi and back, said there was a certain bonhomie on this route. The crew and the season ticket holders used to chat and joke and though the train was slow, it catered to students and office-goers.According to B. Velmurugan, secretary of Bodi Merchants Association, Students and employees of Theni Collectorate, Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar College in Usilampatti, Arul Anandar College in Karumathur and Madurai Kamaraj university used this train every day, he said.A large number of migrant workers from Theni district, especially in Information Technology industry, travel regularly to Chennai and Bengaluru. In the absence of affordable and comfortable train travel, people are forced to travel by the 129 omni buses being operated from Cumbum, Bodi, Theni, Chinnamanur, Uthamapalayam, Thevaram, Periyakulam and other places, Mr. Velmurugan added.S. Muthuramalingam, a silk cotton merchant, said that more than the passenger traffic, this region had huge potential to transport cardamom, silk cotton, grapes, tomatoes, plantains, mangoes, pepper, tea and coffee. A bale of cotton that costs Rs. 250 to transport to Gujarat by train costs Rs. 750 when sent by lorry. Moreover railways gives concession for bulk consignments, he said.M. Sampath, a cardamom and pepper merchant, said, About 80,000 kg to 1 lakh kg of cardamom is sent by road from Bodi to New Delhi, Kanpur, Kolkata and Mumbai on an auction day. But it incurred pilferage, corruption and delay. Bodi traders used to send goods from Erode so as to avoid transhipment, if sent from Madurai or Dindigul. If the Madurai-Bodi line is expedited, it will be a win-win situation for both the traders and the railways.The traders want Bodi station to be a terminus with all facilities such as pit lines for maintenance of coaches so that long distance trains could be operated. They are even ready to bear the expenses for constructing the station building.I used to take my family by train. Our Brownie would travel in the dog box. Everybody used to enjoy the journeyT.S.

Its impact will continue to hurt people for some days yet. As residents rushed to stock up on vegetables after the rain largely kept off during the day, they realised that not much was available in the local markets or Chala.Whatever little was available was a few days old. If at all new stock was available, it was of poor quality.A retail vegetable seller in Karamana said prices of some vegetables had risen steeply. Carrots, for instance, cost Rs. 110 to Rs. 130 a kg, depending on quality. Some vegetables are not available. There are no curry leaves to be had. Lemons too are difficult to come by, the vendor said. Picking up the thundan chilli variety, he said those were starting to rot though they had just been bought. These cost Rs. 140. A few days ago, large thundan chillies cost Rs. 120.A wholesale dealer in Chala market said they had last received fresh stock two days ago, but had run out of those. To meet their commitments, including that to supermarkets, they are forced to buy vegetables from within the Chala market. We have placed orders, but our suppliers in Tamil Nadu say they are not getting enough vegetables. We are selling tomatoes at Rs. 60, but there is almost no stock left. Drumstick, he said, cost Rs. 200 a kg.A wholesale plantain dealer said he sold the nendran variety at Rs. 32, but prices would go down further owing to large-scale damage to plantain crop in Parassala, Kaliyikkavila and growing areas in Tamil Nadu.A retail vendor said prices, which had just started to stabilise, would rise in the aftermath of Ockhi. Some vegetables are not available. Others such as tomato, the price of which had just dipped to Rs. 55 a kg, will now shoot up. On Sunday, tomato cost Rs. 80 a kg.Horticorp chairman Vinayan said supply from other States had not been affected, but Ockhi had inflicted damage in areas where crops such as carrot, cabbage, and cauliflower were grown in the State. There is harvested stock for now, but whatever had been sown has been lost, and the real impact will be felt in a couple of months."

As the BJP tries to win back its loyal supporters, Gujarat Deputy Chief Minister Nitinbhai Patel speaks in the midst of hectic campaigning in Mehsana.The Patidar factor or their anger seems to be your biggest challenge. Whats your assessment?When the agitation began, there was more support. However, we have been able to address the issues by starting new schemes for non-reserved categories, including Patidars.For example, when a boy or a girl who takes admission to a self-financing college or a government institution, the Gujarat government pays 50% of the tuition fee. It covers engineering or medical colleges.When a rural student stays in a hostel, the government now pays up to Rs. 1,200 of the food bill. From primary to Class 12 students, books and uniforms are given by the government. Earlier, these used to be given to only students of SC and ST but we have done away with the distinction.After Congress leader Kapil Sibal offered a formula for reservation to PAAS leaders, your comment that a foolish formula had been offered to fools became controversial, as insulting your community.I had said the Supreme Court, through various judgments, has made it clear that there can be no reservation beyond the existing ceiling (50% reservation limit). Despite knowing this, a well-known lawyer like Kapil Sibal had offered a formula. He himself knows that it will be struck down in one appeal. But to take political advantage, he misled everyone. The Congress, even till this minute, has still not made the formula public.When such a big lawyer, after knowing Supreme Court judgments, offers a formula, then it is making fools out of those fellows who are part of their [PAAS] core group. I didnt say anything insulting about our community.The Congress has also questioned your development model and has alleged that vikas has gone mad. Your response?If they are fighting an election, they have to say something for campaigning. You are travelling around the State and you must have seen how good the roads are. Look at our power situation, look at our water supply or our agriculture. We have the best of best infrastructure in Gujarat. Whether it is a tribal village or a remote part of the State, every part has good connectivity and good infrastructure.Rahul Gandhi is campaigning hard in Gujarat this time. His rallies are being well attended and it is being said that people are listening to what he has to say. How do you view it?Even in this small village, people of all ages have come  from children to seniors. So people come to see him as well but it does not mean that they will vote. And the Congress also gets people from outside to fill its meetings. When a leader or an actor comes, people come to see them but it doesnt mean they will get support. Even during Indira jis time there used to be people. Sonia Gandhi also used to come to Gujarat frequently yet we have been ruling the State for 22 years. In recent times, they have lost eight State elections and more recently, they got wiped out in Uttar Pradesh. Last week, in civic polls, they lost even Amethi that has been with them for the last 50 years.Mr. Gandhi hasnt said anything about that. It is clear that people these days want to see work and not go by name alone.The Congress and Mr. Gandhi have raised the issue of price rise or monghvari in Gujarati and people are connecting with the issue. Whats your take?Price rise has two aspects. A farmer wants good price for his produce and the consumer wants the same at minimum price. As a government, it is our responsibility to manage both. Many a time when there is a temporary surge, it naturally applies to all equally. It is not as if prices have gone up because there is a BJP government in Gujarat. In Karnataka, there is a Congress government and tomatoes, potatoes and onions would be similarly priced. Or in Kerala where there is a Communist government, prices of vegetables would be similar.How many seats will the BJP get in these elections?We have already accepted the challenge of 150 plus seats. We have done good work and peoples faith and support are with us.You dont think there is anti-incumbency?We dont have anti-incumbency as we have delivered. Governments that dont work start feeling anti-incumbency but our ministers, MLAs, workers all go and work among the people. Nobody can tell us that we have come to the people after five years. We firmly believe that we will get 150 seats.If they [the Congress] are fighting an election, they have to say something for campaigning"

More significantly, the economy clocked a growth of 6.3% in the second quarter of this year, after slowing for at least four quarters. But official data for the third quarter (October to December) so far suggest that the economy is still not entirely out of the woods and fresh headwinds, such as rising oil prices, could upset the fragile recovery. Manufacturing growth, driven by restocking by producers after the rollout of the goods and services tax, was a major factor in the second quarter growth pick-up. After two months of robust 4%-plus growth, industrial activity however slipped in October, with the Index of Industrial Production reflecting just 2.2% growth. October was a festive month but consumer durables production contracted by nearly 7%, mining was virtually stagnant, and manufacturing growth moderated to 2.5% from 3.8% last year. This coincides with exporters seeing a 1.1% slump in shipments in October, after growing at an average of over 13% in the second quarter. It is also borne out by the nearly 10% drop in GST collections that month compared to September. The IIP has now grown just 2.5% in the first seven months of 2017-18, compared to 5.5% in the same period last fiscal.If the spectre of slower growth with weak exports at a time when global trade is recovering is not worrying enough, with job creation still to pick up, the latest inflation data set too is cause for concern. Prices at the consumer level rose at the fastest pace in 15 months this November, with inflation touching 4.88%, up from 3.6% in October and just 1.5% in June. This reflects a broad-based price rise under way, although it is led by fuel inflation (at 7.2%, from 6.1% a month ago) and food inflation (4.4%, from 1.9% in October). Within food, rising onion and tomato prices pushed vegetable inflation to a 16-month high of 22.5%; inflation in egg prices quickened from 0.8% in October to 8% in November. While some of this food inflation could wane in the coming months, there is greater concern about the rise in core inflation (excluding food and fuel) and inflation imported through high global prices. On Tuesday, oil prices breached the $65 a barrel mark for the first time in over two years. The government faces difficult choices. Slashing fuel taxes could calm inflation, but it would hit revenue collections that are already uncertain owing to GST deadline extensions. Not doing so would leave less room for the central bank to lower interest rates. As the Economic Survey said, oil at $60-65 could hit consumption and public investment and dent private investment further. That is not a path to a sustained revival."

(Express Photo: Gurmeet Singh) Rural India has lagged behind the cities since the 1991 economic reforms. (Express Photo: Gurmeet Singh)Bharat vs India, a phrase coined by Charan Singh to describe the conflict between villages and cities, remains relevant. This is evident from the Kisan Sansad (farmers parliament) that met in Delhi last month. More than 40,000 peasants belonging to 180 farmers organisations came together to form the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC).Rural India has lagged behind the cities since the 1991 economic reforms. According to the National Sample Survey, the average Monthly Per Capita Expenditure (MPCE) in 1993-94 was Rs 281 in rural India and Rs 458 in urban India. It rose to Rs 772 (up 174 per cent) and Rs 1,472 (up 221 per cent) for rural and urban India respectively in 2007-08, which means that the gap between rural and urban jumped from 63 to 91 percentage points. The gap diminished somewhat between 2007-08 and 2011-12, with rural MPCE reaching Rs 1,430 (up 85 per cent) as an average and the urban rising to 2,630 (up 79 per cent), but it remained more than 20 percentage points higher than what it was in 1993-94 at 84 percentage points.This is partly due to the slow growth of agriculture over the last decade. Between the years 2005-06 and 2011-12, the average annual growth rate of industry at constant 2004-05 prices has been 7.5 per cent, while services grew at an ever-quicker pace, 9.95 per cent. However, agriculture lagged behind at 3.8 per cent. In the following three years, 2012-2015, the average agricultural GDP growth rate was 1.7 per cent. In 2014-15, the growth rate of agriculture was negative at  0.2 per cent. It was only 1.1 per cent in 2015-16 and, thanks to a good monsoon, about 4 per cent in 2016-17, the growth rate the five-year plan considered as necessary to ensure food security.Different factors are responsible for these changes. First, the size of holdings has shrunk over the years: The average land owned by peasants fell from 0.725 ha to 0.592 ha between 2002-03 and 2012-13. As a result, the proportion of those owning less than one ha increased from 79.7 per cent to 82.8 per cent. Since a farm household needs at least 1 hectare of land to make ends meet, over half of the farmers are in debt: The average loan amount for a farm household in India today is Rs 47,000. Second, irrigation has stagnated with less than half of Indian farmland irrigated, partly because of the groundwater crisis: Water tables fell by 65 per cent in 10 years. Third, peasants suffer from one obsession of the government: The price of food. To neutralise any risk of inflation on that front, the growth rate of rural wages has been limited  in 2015, it was the lowest in 10 years (and lower than the inflation rate). That was related to the squeezing of the MGNREGA programme, which was blamed for rising rural wages. But more than wages, food prices were targeted. To spare urban consumers, they were kept low and the government even precipitated food prices deflation by allowing imports. Soyabean is a case in point, when this year market was flooded with cheap soyabean oil imports. Though the government can impose duty up to 45 per cent, but it kept the rate at 12.5 per cent.In 2017 summer, farmers across India started agitating for better prices. They wanted the M.S. Swaminathan Commission report, which recommended minimum support prices, to be implemented. Maharashtra farmers demanded better prices for onions and other pulses; in Himachal Pradesh, it was for tomatoes; in Punjab and Haryana, it was potatoes and maize; in Rajasthan, garlic; in Gujarat, groundnuts; in Madhya Pradesh, soyabean; in Andhra, Telangana and Karnataka, chilli and so on. In June, when Maharashtra farmers, who were on strike, took out a march to Mumbai, the BJP government agreed to a Rs 30,000-crore loan waiver. The protest spread to Madhya Pradesh, where five people were killed in Mandsaur district in police firing. Farmers mobilised also because of demonetisation, which badly affected rural India.Though the agitation fit the traditional pattern of kisan politics, the mobilisations, unlike in the previous decades, achieved little. Loans were waived for peasants, mainly in Maharashtra and UP. However, this measure didnt help much. The procedure to receive reimbursement is bureaucratic and the amount waived is sometimes minimal (Rs 10 to Rs 500). Besides, only a third of the small and marginal farmers have access to institutional credit: Banks do not lend money to the poor. The others turn to money lenders, who do not waive loans. Besides, loan waiver is only a temporary relief.Why did the peasant mobilisations achieve so little? The reason could be the urban consumer bias of the BJP, the new political hegemon. The party has turned its back to the Gandhian dimension of Deendayal Upadhyayas Jana Sangh and is focussed on urban development, as evident from the smart cities flagship programme. It sees industrialisation as the best way to modernise India and create jobs. More urban dwellers supported the party than villagers in the 2014 election  by 10 percentage points, according to the CSDS-Lokniti survey. The urban bias of the government was obvious in its attempt to amend the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2015 in favour of industrialists. When the Opposition forced the government to backtrack, Prime Minister Modi invited the states to reform and the BJP-ruled states were the first to change the law.Budget cuts have reduced the spending on the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana and the Integrated Watershed Management Programme and Accelerated Irrigation Benefits and Flood Management Programme. In this context, it isnt surprising that 40 per cent of Indian farmers do not like to farm any more. Hence the demand among young Patels, Marathas, Jats and Kapus for reservations in the (urban) public sector.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

But after reaching the market, he was disappointed in the wake of the extremely low prices he got for his greens.A couple of months ago, he sold the same quantity of greens for Rs. 1,000. However, this time, he had no choice but to accept Rs. 300 for his produce.The crash in the prices of vegetables in the market here has, on the one hand, brought cheer among customers as they are buying greens and vegetables at a cheaper price, the farmers, on the other, are extremely disappointed as they are unable to retrieve even the cost of cultivation and transportation.Sunday, when the main vegetable market functions in the district, witnessed vegetable being sold at the lowest price in the last three months. While a small bunch of coriander cost Rs. 10-Rs. 15 sometime ago, on Sunday customers bought five such bunches for a mere Rs. 10 in the retail market.Other green vegetables are also being sold at such low prices allowing customers to buy more vegetables for a small price.Tomatoes, which were sold at around Rs. 60- Rs. 80 per kg till about three months ago, are now available at Rs. 7- Rs. 10 per kg.Besides the general public, hotels and restaurants owners are delighted as they are able to buy huge quantity of vegetables at small prices.The farmers believe that owing to good monsoon, many farmers have cultivated vegetables in their fields, because of which prices have sharply declined.In the summer, only those farmers who have irrigation facility cultivate vegetables; therefore, the prices go up owing to limited cultivation of vegetables.But post-monsoon, since most of the fields have adequate moisture, farmers use the opportunity to cultivate short-term vegetable crops. When most of them do the same thing, the prices obviously come down in the market, said an official in the Horticulture Department.While the prices of a majority of vegetables have dipped sharply, the onion farmers are in a good mood because of a better price their produce is fetching  Rs. 40-Rs. 50 per kg. Onion was sold at about Rs. 20 per kg a couple of months ago."

Carrots, which were earlier being sold at Rs 50 per kg in the retail market, are now Rs 120.At Gultekdi wholesale market, majority of farm produces are being traded between Rs 30 and 50 per kg. Green peas and drumsticks are selling at the highest prices, between Rs 80 and Rs 100 per kg.Ajit Pawar, another trader, said, This climate leads to crop destruction and, thus, prices have risen. Traders said while the end prices have increased, the extra costs viz that of transport and middlemen have stayed the same.Most of the residents, who usually buy vegetables from wholesale markets, said they have resigned to the higher prices. One such customer, Hemant Edaka, said, These are essential commodities, we have no other choice but to buy them.At the Chhatrapati Shivaji Market in Camp, while the market was better stocked, same prices were being quoted by the traders. Ravi, a trader, said, Continuos heavy downpour has led to this situation.Customers are buying less. If someone bought a kilo earlier, they are now buying 500 grams. The middleman is also a problem, he added.Another trader Firoz Khan said, Prices are soon expected to fall, when the weather gets better. However, customers cant stop buying vegetables.

Tomatoes have been withdrawn from McDonalds items because, according to the company, there have been quality issues with the produce.In Maharashtra, most of the the winter crop of tomato comes from Niphad and its adjoining talukas in Nashik district, while the Junnar tehsil in Pune provides the summer crop. Multi-national chains usually follow a farm-to-fork model, under which growers directly supply the produce to their stores.Selected stores of McDonalds follow the same model in Maharashtra. Confirming that McDonalds outlets in the state have stopped serving tomatoes since last week, a spokesperson of the fast food chain said, We have observed certain quality issues in tomatoes and the current supplies are not meeting McDonalds stringent quality standards. So, we have decided against using the ingredient in certain cities.The spokesperson added that the chain was monitoring supplies on a daily basis and would start serving tomatoes as soon as the produce met their quality standards. On the other hand, growers lamented that heavy rain in Nashik during the fag end of monsoon season had affected the produce. Santosh Gorade, a farmer from Takli village in Niphad taluka, said heavy rain had washed away almost 80-90 per cent of the crop. The crop was almost market-ready, but the rain destroyed it.

The most expensive vegetable at the market was drumstick, which was being sold at Rs. 100 to Rs. 120 per kg. This is in sharp contrast to the usual rate of Rs. 30 to Rs. 45 in the APMC. Shankar Pingle, former director, APMC (vegetable division), said: The rates of drumsticks have been on the rise since November due to unseasonal flash showers in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. There has been a dip in supply from Gujarat and Nashik too, which meet most of the supply in December and January.Meanwhile, the prices of onions which had fallen to Rs. 25 to Rs. 30 on Monday, shot up again to Rs. 30 to Rs. 35 on Friday despite stable supply.

Besides the poor arrivals, marriage season added to the supply-demand gap in carrots as many consumers bought vegetables directly from the wholesale markets in bulk quantities. Those who visit rythu bazaars hardly come forward to buy carrots and a few end up buying 100 to 250 grams, says P. Rameshwari, a farmer from K. Kotapadu.Consultant of Horticulture Department Y. Nanaji says that even in Anandapuram, Araku and Sabbavaram mandals, the crops have been affected this year. These are some of the regions where the farmers grow carrot. However, the production is comparatively low even in these areas. The arrivals are likely to improve in the coming weeks with the harvest of the crops sown by local farmers, he observes.Main rythu bazaars such as Gopalapatnam, Kancharapalem, Akkayapalem, MVP Colony and Seethammadhara used to get one to two tonnes of carrot a day.

But the calm is misleading as the electoral battle in Vadodara reflects the larger contest in the State with the Congress trying to break into this BJP fort.For the BJP, it is a prestige battle for repeating its clean sweep of all 10 seats in the district in the 2012 Assembly elections. After Mr. Modi vacated his Lok Sabha seat preferring Varanasi, the partys nominee won with a handsome margin in the byelection.Dropping marginThe margin of our defeat in every Assembly segment during the Lok Sabha polls was 50,000 or more. But this dropped to 15,000 in 2015, when the civic elections were held. We lost the seats, but our votes went up, says Ami Ravat, an urban planner who became a Congress municipal councillor two years ago. She is now a ticket hopeful for the Sayajiganj Assembly seat.Her husband, Narendra Ravat, a general secretary of the Congress in the State, too is a contender. Though he lost the Lok Sabha bypoll in Vadodara, he says the absence of Narendra Modi as Chief Minister has made a big difference now.The Congress in Gujarat has popularised a social media campaign, Vikas Gando Thayo Che (Development gone crazy), and is banking on the anger among voters who are now willing to ask questions to the BJP government.In Vadodara city, people agree that the Congress has registered a strong presence this time, but is still not a threat to the BJP.Yes, the Congresss central leadership is campaigning extensively in Gujarat. I have seen that people are going for Rahul Gandhis rally, but they have nothing to offer except their anti-BJP stance, Yogesh Bhai Patel, a six-time MLA, says.There is a drinking water problem. The Congress wont tell you what it will do but will simply criticise us, says Mr. Patel, who avoids giving a clear answer on the impact of the Patidar agitation.My sense is we are not affected here in central Gujarat; you please ask me questions related to Vadodara, he says.But barely 30 km out of the city, people are more forthcoming with their views.At Fartikui, a model village with a predominant Patel population that boasts a government school, a dispensary, a milk collection centre and filtration plant for drinking water, the mood is split down the middle.Village elders, mostly Patidars, sitting under a banyan tree at the main chowk (centre), say there is no water to irrigate the fields of cotton and tur dal. Prices of diesel and fertilizers are rising.Vegetables such as onions and tomatoes are out of reach of the common man. Earlier, they would blame the Congress government at the Centre. Now they cant do that, Mahindra Bhai Daya Bhai Patel, a farmer, says.Asked about the Patidar demand for reservation, he wonders, How can any party offer it if the Constitution doesnt allow it?This group says that while the Congress candidate Sidharth Patel (son of the former Chief Minister Chimanbhai Patel) is a local, his BJP rival, Shailesh Mehta, is an outsider and Brahmin.The story repeats itself in Dabhoi on the outskirts of Vadodara and in other constituencies in Vadodara district. Padra, Savli and Vaghoria are among the seats where the BJP is battling dissidence and open defiance against the partys official nominee.No, these are not serious issues, only internal differences. That will get sorted out on its own, Mr. Yogesh Patel says."

But these days she is faced with a tough choice, whether to add onions to the food items or not. That's because the price of onions is steadily climbing the charts and has reached Rs 50/kg in the retail market, up by Rs 10 from last week. And if market insiders are to be believed, the cost could go up further.The spike in onion prices, along with the rise in the cost of vegetables are burning a hole in the pocket of the common people. Even the state government's assurance to deal with the price rise by importing onions from neighbouring states have failed to yield results.""Usually I require around 2-3 kg of onions every week to cook food for my family of five. After the price rise I am trying to manage with 1kg. I am finding it very difficult to cook non-veg food,"" said Pati, a housewife.""For the past two months onions are being sold at Rs 40 per kg and above. Last week it suddenly increased to Rs 46 and today it has gone up to Rs 50 per kg. How can a family manage with such stiff hike of essential commodities?"" asked Manisha Behera, another homemaker.On october 28, food supplies and consumer welfare minister Surya Narayan Patro had said that the prices would come down within one week after the new harvest.""The new harvest will arrive in the next one week after which the situation is likely to improve. I have also requested the Maharashtra government to supply onions to us first as our consumers are facing inconvenience,"" Patro had said.On Thursday, when asked about the prevailing situation, Patro said: ""Now procurement of all agriculture products will be made through e-procurement. So once fresh procurement orders are placed the prices are likely to drop.""Traders said the main reason behind the hike in onion prices was the loss of crop due to bad weather and the cost being high in the source states. ""On Thursday wholesale price at Nasik mandi was Rs 4,200 to Rs 4,500 per quintal. After adding transportation cost, the price in Odisha will be more than Rs 5,000 per quintal,"" said Sameer Das , a wholesale trader at Unit-I market.The prices of vegetables too are moving up.

A kg of good quality onions now costs Rs 65-Rs 70 in Bengaluru's retail markets Decreased supply and increasing demand have sent the prices of onions and shallots (small onions) soaring, say farmers and traders. Even shallot prices have doubled; they range from Rs 160 to Rs 170 in the open market. Such a steep hike has not been witnessed in many years, say some farmers from North Karnataka, which is a major onion-producing region.On an average, Bengaluru markets receive 80 to 100 truckloads of onions daily. Now only 20 to 25 truckloads of onions are being supplied from Hubballi and parts of Andhra Pradesh, which is one-fourth of the daily requirement, according to an office-bearer of the Bangalore Onion Traders Association . As a result, a kg of onion which was available at Rs 30-40 just a week ago now costs Rs 70. And in another one week, it may cross Rs 80, fear traders.In the wholesale market, onion prices are up by 25% in the past five days at Hubballi APMC, Asia's largest wholesale market for onions. Modal prices have been hovering at Rs 3,000-Rs 5,000 per quintal depending of the onion quality, due to a delay in arrival of the fresh kharif harvest.North Karnataka districts, including Dharwad, Gadag, Koppal, Belagavi and Raichur, were meeting 75 per cent of Karnataka's onion demand. The state gets the remaining 25 per cent from Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.""Normal supply of onion is possible only after farmers take up rabi cultivation and after resumption of road communication, which may take another one or two months,'' said Wahab Mulla, general secretary, Onion and Potato Merchants Association M K Patil, a senior horticulture officer said the prices of onions are expected to stabilize as the Centre has decided to impose a minimum export price (MEP) of $850 per tonne on onions to increase domestic supply and check rising costs. They have also asked public sector body Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation (MMTC) to import 2,000 tonnes of onions in order to check prices in local markets.Market sources expect a further increase in onion prices as the supply from North Karnataka is unlikely to be resumed soon. Other vegetables whose prices have shot up during the past couple of days include carrot, coriander leaves, cauliflower, cabbage, beans and tomato."

While the showers are responsible for pulling down prices of a handful of vegetables , it has adversely affected the stocks of others, thereby burning a hole in consumers' pockets.Over the last few days, prices of cabbage and cauliflower have dropped sharply, thanks the low-pressure triggered rain. Wholesalers have resorted to distress sale to clear the cabbage-cauliflower stock damaged by the rain.But buyers are not so lucky when it comes to other vegetables. Prices of some staple vegetables have remained consistently at or above Rs 50/kg. This is bit unusual if you look at previous years. By this time last year, vegetable prices nosedived sharply.According to sources, rain has delayed harvesting of winter vegetables in Bengal, forcing the state to depend on other states. Consumers, subsequently, are bearing the price burden. ""Most of the winter vegetables we are now getting is coming from outside. Peyajkoli (Scallion), which is coming from Karimpur in Bangladesh , remains pricey. Tomato from Purulia has just started arriving. So, tomato price is likely to crash in two-three days,"" said Kamal Dey, Koley Market vendors association president and Bengal government's market task force member.But the showers have spelt doom for potato. After last year's bumper crop, this year was predicted to be a lean year. But the untimely rain can make it far worse. ""So, potato prices might shoot up unusually,"" said Dey.But what is most striking is the gap between wholesale and retail prices. ""Around 20% is the reasonable gap between wholesale and retail prices, if you take into account transportation cost, waste and local market levy by trading associations. But in case of most of the vegetables, the difference is between 60% and 80%,"" said Anubrata Chatterjee, an agro-retail economist.The government should put up a board at every municipal market to publicize wholesale prices so that a consumer knows whether the retail vendor is asking for too much, advised Dey. An aware consumer can always bring down the price of vegetables at a reasonable level.Last week's rain has hit the prime vegetable producing districts like South 24 Parganas, East, Bankura, Hooghly and Howrah hard. In South 24 Parganas, 8,242 hectares have been affected, followed by East Midnapore (6,984 hectares), Bankura (4,380 hectares) and Hooghly (1,544 hectares),"" said an agriculture department officer."

On Bandra's Linking Road , for instance, which boasts department stores, fast-food chains and hordes of pedestrians, hawkers are willing to pay as much as Rs 20,000 per month.This money isn't used to bribe a BMC official despite the fact that the hawker is squatting on a public footpath. Instead, explains a local politician, it finds its way into the hands of local 'seths' and 'sahabs' with political connections, who have ""captured"" this location illegally and are now sub-letting it for a fee. The more the footfall in an area, the more those controlling the space demand. If a hawker is unwilling to pay, the space is immediately given to the next person in line.Irfan Chand (name changed), who sells maxi dresses, found this out two years ago when the BMC evicted him from his original spot outside Jogeshwari railway station. ""I started searching for another space, and I found this spot at Andheri , but I was told that it belongs to someone already,"" says Chand. ""I now have to pay him Rs200 every day for doing my business here.""Hawkers dot the footpaths outside railway stations because commuters have to walk to and fro, providing them with a captive clientele. BMC officials have been trying to clear these areas to reduce congestion but have found it to be an uphill task. ""The lakhs of people who travel by local trains prefer picking up fruits and vegetables on their way home instead of heading to a market,"" says a BMC official. ""This makes our job even more difficult as people patronize these hawkers."" On the other hand, hawkers complain that the BMC's eviction drives negatively impact their business.Some, however, do brisk business anyway, making as much as Rs50,000 a day. Dharmen Gupta sells imported fruit outside Santacruz railway station and earns Rs40,000 per day though he claims his profit is only Rs2,000-4,000. He explains that this is because fruits are perishable and so if they don't sell, he has to offload them on another fruit seller at the wholesale price.Food items often sell in places where there are many schools, colleges and restaurants. These lanes often become unofficial 'khau gallis'. Bandra corporator Asif Zakaria says that the KFC lane, off Bandra's Linking Road, has seen a huge spurt in the number of hawkers selling fast food even though cooking on the road is strictly prohibited. But hawkers are willing to break the law because of the spiking demand. Babloo Raja, who sits outside Dadar's St Paul's High School, remembers selling 'Chinese bhel' for Rs5 just five years ago. Now, a plate is Rs15.The price of goods and their quality also varies in different locations. At Kurla market, for instance, tomatoes sell for Rs55-60 a kg but they can't match the quality of those sold at Andheri's Lokhandwala market for Rs70. And in residential localities, hawkers have loyal customers. ""Ours is a family business. Therefore most of our customers are old- timers from the locality, says Jeetendra Tripathi, who sells fruits at Vile Parle market.(This is Part 2 of a series on hawking in Mumbai. Tomorrow: In Part 3, we tell you about the 'protection' involved in the business and the money which exchanges hands)"

CM Manohar Lal Khattar unveiled the scheme  which will be initially extended to famers growing potato, onion, tomato and cauliflower  in Karnal.Haryana director general of horticulture Arjun Saini said the schemes aim was to help farmers in distress and ensure they recover input costs. For example, if a farmer has spent Rs 400 on producing 100kg potato, he is free to sell it at any price to reap profits. However, if he fails to recover his input cost due to drop in rates, the department will compensate for the difference, he added.Saini said the cost of horticulture produce would be determined by experts from the Haryana Agriculture University, department of horticulture and Kisan Ayog. It is different from minimum support price (MSP). With this, distressed farmers growing vegetables in Haryana will no more have to throw their produce on roads in the event of a crash in prices. The idea is to encourage them to resort to diversification of crops, he said.The department clarified that farmers would be compensated only if they registered themselves on the portal and the produce was sold through the market committees using J-forms. A separate fund would be constituted by the state government for the scheme.Speaking at the inauguration of scheme, Khattar said compensation at the rate of Rs 400 per quintal would be given for tomato and potato, and the amount would be Rs 500 per quintal for onion and cauliflower.Terming the scheme as a big sham and a huge fraud on the farmers of the state, Haryana Congress legislature party leader Kiran Choudhry said the state government should fix MSP for vegetables and procure those if it was keen to help them.She added that the scheme seeking to offer input cost for four crops  potato, onion, cabbage and tomatofrom January onwards, consciously puts the cost of growing way below the cost price so that the government was not made to pay anything."

Skipping dinner and choosing to stick to just snacks is also a no-no. Avoid rotis and rice and limit your alcohol consumption to less than 100ml for a healthy start to the new year, they say.According to Debashish Saha , consultant, AMRI Hospital , green salad, non-oily snacks and non-greasy meat are perfect for having a blast on December 31 without weighing your system down. The tendency is to consume oily snacks like kebabs, fish fingers and cheese balls along with alcohol. It kills your appetite, making you skip dinner. That results in indigestion and hangover. Rather, one should pick salad or fruits if they are available. In case they are not, limit your alcohol consumption and make sure to have your dinner sans carbohydrates, said Saha.It could be a challenge to restrict alcohol consumption at a New Years party, so make sure you have the right kind of stuff to limit the negative effects, says microbiologist Irfaan Akhtar. It is important to know your limits. While its important not to consume alcohol on an empty stomach, dont stuff yourself with food either. Dry snacks and non-spicy dishes should be chosen. Diabetics and cardiac patients should avoid whisky and opt for red wine instead. It is important to go slow on starters since one often ends up having too much protein in a short span of time. This could affect the kidneys, said Akhtar.However, more than the food or drink, it is often hand hygiene that leaves party-hoppers sick the next morning, points out Arindam Biswas, consultant, RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences.Biswas added that some myths about preventing hangovers needed to be busted. Cheese or lime water doesnt help. In fact, it could lead to severe indigestion the next morning. Rather, take peanuts, lettuce, cabbage leaves, tomatoes and cucumber. Make sure to have plenty of water the next morning and you should be ready to swing into action, he says."

But whats happening in Pune is real.The ride from my home in Anandnagar to SNDT College was a troubled one, said 22-year old Shivani Mirajkar It was not the usual traffic mess that was testing her nerves but was the small insects that were getting into her eyes throughout the ride. I had to stop several times on the way to rub my eyes. It occurred to me after sometime that I could prevent the insects from getting into my eyes by pulling down the visor of my helmet, she said.For the past two days, the tiny insects are clouding thoroughfares such as Sinhagad Road, Paud Road, Congress Bhavan road and F C Road.Mangesh Kavtekar said the constant bumping of the insects on his helmet visor not only annoyed him, but also was a major distraction during his ride from Paud Road.It felt like someone was spraying my visor with dot-like objects. It was annoying and a big distraction. I constantly wondered what they are. I also had to slow down, as I could not pay attention to where I was heading to, he said.Senior zoologist Hemant Ghate identified the distraction as aphid  a tiny greenish translucent-winged insect.The insects are seen around in a minor swarm. Aphids are plant bugs. The insects usually take to the wings when the temperature is warm, particularly during winter. There are hundreds of species of the insect and it is not easy to identify them in a short time, he said.Various species of aphids affect crop plants such as soybean and tomato. In nature, there are also predators of these tiny insects. Ladybird beetles feed on eggs and the wingless forms of the aphids, Ghate said, adding that the presence of these insects will be felt for the next two days."

Almost 49,000 children are affected by malnutrition in the district. The district which adds immensely to the overall sugarcane produce has been lagging in production of cash crops like pulses and vegetables, forcing the farmers to procure it at higher rates from the market.In the new scheme of things, department will promote mixed farming with impetus on farming of vegetables and pulses in tandem with sugarcane. On pilot basis, 22,000 hectare has been identified where mixed farming is being practiced.According to statistics, provided by district programme office, there are around 3.39 lakh children in the district. Of these, while 49,000 are malnourished and around 20,000 children are acutely malnourished. These kids are from 0 to 5 years old. Besides this, women are also suffering from anemia.According to official, it is because of increase in sugarcane cultivation area. In west UP, including Bijnor , farmers had almost sidelined other crops. Most of the farmers are growing only sugarcane.The district cane officer OP Singh said, We have assigned a target of sowing 22,000 hectare intercrop in sugarcane. Earlier, Bijnor district is a hub of sugarcane crop. Farmers have adopted it as a main crop as it is a cash crop and does not require much labourer. On our suggestion, the farmers have started growing some crops like cauliflower, bringal, tomato, capsicum, radish, salgum, gram, ourad, mong, masoor with sugarcane crop.Director of agriculture department, JP Chaudhary , said, The initiative will help improve the health of malnourished kids and women in the district. We are holding meetings in every village and motivating the farmers. Efforts will start bearing fruits soon."

I can buy fresh tomatoes daily as they cost less, she said.Shalini Khera from RT Nagar was happy that the prices were low but said the quality was bad too. The quality has also been affected. We get raw or rotten tomatoes mixed with good quality ones, she pointed out.Till August, tomatoes prices kept rising and hit Rs 100 a kg. Until two weeks ago, they were sold for Rs 40-50 a kg.Rates at Hopcoms (Horticulture Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society) stores were at Rs 10 a kg on Sunday.The reason behind the drop in prices is good rain that the state received this year. This led to a larger crop, said wholesalers. The supply has increased from tomato-growing districts like Chikkballapur, Kolar and Mandya. We cant store the crop as it is a perishable commodity. We expect the prices to remain the same for the next two weeks, said R V Gopi, president, City Market Vegetable Merchants Association.Tomato is grown on about 59,000 hectares across state. Kolar district grows tomato on 17,000 hectares of land.Mohammad Manjur Ahmad, a vegetable vendor from Munireddypalya, said, The increased yield leads to wastage of stock. We cant store them and we are not able to sell all of it in a day. We buy it at Rs 15 a kg from wholesalers but are forced to retail at Rs 10 a kg.Another vegetable vendor from Shivajinagar, Imran Khan said, Though tomatoes sell more than any other fruit or vegetable, the high supply has pushed the prices down.

An equivalent of this popular scene from Yash Chopras Kala Patthar (1979) is playing out simultaneously in a car at a drive-in theatre with don Raees (Shah Rukh Khan) ordering a mill owner to give the neighbourhood workers their rightful wages.Its a scene that puts in a nutshell one of the many things that Rahul Dholakia is trying to do with SRK in Raees  making him play a version of the Angry Young Man of the 70s and the 80s. Quite like Big Bs Vijay, Raees is anti-establishment, an outlaw and also a Robin Hood figure.Raees is the Vijay of Gujarat where business is so paramount that even prohibition leads to its own illicit trade shoot-offs, where bootlegging is a strong commercial force thriving on a political nexus. The subversive streak is visible right from the start when the voiceover says  pabandi bagawat ki shuruaat hoti hai (imposing restrictions leads to rebellion). Where there is a will there has to be a way. So you have alcohol-shot tomatoes on sale and liquor consumed in tea cups.Along with all of this, Dholakia also channels the early dark avatars of SRK  in Baazigar and Darr . But what is most interesting is how he sets up Raees within a religious and community context.In Raees, SRK and Dholakia would rather dare than play it safe. The character, ostensibly based on the life of criminal Abdul Latif, walks on the razors edge. Its a complicated portrayal. Some would complain of a whitewash regarding the alleged Dawood and Mumbai blast linkages. But it is in line with grounding SRK in his faith, and making him rise above it.We begin with a person who puts business above religion and doesnt intend to harm others. Betrayals lead him to cross over to the dark side. More severe transgressions  like encouraging rioting and violence  follow. Yet he is also the  masiha  (messiah) who feeds the needy and affected.He is parallel government to the community. Yet he is not a superman, a man who uses the system as much as he is used; who kills yet cries at his failure to provide housing to his community. Raees is more of a Shakespearean tragic hero, so is his fall. The moral compass remains intact; transgressions are not denied. There is no escaping guilt either.  Mohalla bachate bachate shehar jala diya (In trying to save the neighbourhood I set the town afire, he says.The adversary, cop Jaideep Ambalal Majmudar (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), gets an equal play. Its a cat-and-mouse game between equals. In fact, with his poker-faced humour, sharp lines and Michael Jackson entry, Siddiqui gets to play to the gallery more than SRK himself and remains one up on him throughout. There are some nice touches, like Majmudar snooping on the love chat between Raees and his wife. He is human after all. The supporting cast shines. One only wishes there was more of Sheeba Chaddha and Loveleen Mishra.If it is Gujarat, can Gandhi be far behind? Early on in the film, there is a lovely scene of Raees stealing a pair of spectacles from the Gandhi statue because he cant afford to buy a frame for himself. The doctor asks him to put the glasses back on the statue and gives him another pair, a pair that eventually comes to stand for entirely the opposite of Gandhis vision of non-violence. A messiah lost to the people, the state and a nation.

It had also planned transport subsidy for vegetable growers.However, when HT visited Laxmibai Nagar and Choithram mandisthe largest in the regionthe promised facilities were not available.People buying vegetables at Choithram sabji mandi on Monday. (Shankar Mourya/HT photo)Farmers were getting poor prices for a range of vegetables and in some cases, such as green peas and tomatoes, they were not getting enough to even cover the input costs.Our condition has gone from bad to worse due to cash crunch and demonetisation. Today (on Monday) we are getting Rs 50-60 for a crate (25 kg) of tomatoes. That will barely cover the transport, hammali (porter) and mandi charges, said Hukumchand Makwana, a farmer from Piplu village, about 70 km from Indore.We have to pay labourers and also need money for paying interest on debt besides running our households. So we have no option but to sell our produce at low rates, said farmer Shantilal Chawra who has been staying at the mandi premises for past three days to sell his green peas, whose prices have come down to Rs 5 per kg, less than the input costs.The demand-supply equation has also turned against the farmers as production of seasonal vegetables has increased whereas people have tightened their purses.When asked about the support provided by the mandi administration after demonetisation, commission agent Ashok Bhilware said they have been left to fend for themselves.Commission agents act as a link between farmers and wholesale traders to keep the vegetable supply chain running and often lend money to farmers.Small farmers need cash for their daily requirements. Nowadays, there is liquidity crisis but farmers supplying vegetable do not accept cheques, he said.Officials told HT that no directive to provide special facilities to vegetable farmers has come from Bhopal.We have not received any such directive (to talk to the banks about providing cash vans or give transport subsidy) so far from the state government, Praveen Verma, deputy director, MP State Agricultural Marketing Board, Indore region, said.Choithram mandi in-charge B B S Tomar could not be reached for comment despite visit to his office, repeated calls and text messages.WOES MOUNTPrices of potatoes, onions, and seasonal vegetables including tomatoes and green peas have crashed.Transportation costs are increasing due to rise in fuel costs.

The village has a population of 320 people and they are dependent only on agriculture.Villagers complain that in the past one decade or so, attacks by monkeys and wild boars in their agriculture land have made things difficult. We keep guarding fields from monkeys during day and from wild boars during night, said Negi.Farming in hills is shrinking fast and farmers losing interest in it. Besides attacks by monkeys and wild boars, farmers facing problem due to lack of irrigation facility. Farming in hills is rain fed and canals are limited to some pockets.In Doon Dwara, villagers have either stopped or growing limited crops like millets, oats, vegetables like cucumber, tomatoes, potatoes etc.Shyam Singh, another farmer, said monkeys destroy vegetables while wild boars destroy potato fields. We are left with very little options, Singh said.Farming in hills has become a non-profitable entity. Government figure shows that agriculture land came down from 7.91 lakh hectares in 2009-10 to 7.41 lakh in 2011-12.Half of the states agricultural land falls in four districts of Dehradun, Nainital, Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar in plains and rest is shared by nine hill districts.Prakash Dimri, another farmer, said: 2,200 is the average cost that comes on sowing in an area of 0.02 hectares or 1 nali while the return is not more than 1,500.The land holdings are tiny and which are getting further fragmented over time. 87% farming in hills is rain fed while only 13% has irrigation facility, said Vijay Jardhari, an agro expert.Change in the climate pattern is also a big concern, rain cycle is no more regular thus farmers are left with little choice, he said.Jardhari said farmers must continue with millets since it survives drought like condition and give handsome returns. He, however, is clueless on providing solutions to farmers who were not growing millets owing to threat from wild animals.Due to growing population of monkeys, acres of arable land left untilled and agriculture activities have almost reduced to vicinity of houses in the villages.Villagers in Thano in the outskirts of Dehradun are trying to grow crops such as ginger, turmeric, bitter gourd and lady finger that usually monkeys dont eat.People in Balori village that falls in Pauri district have passed a resolution asking the district administration to either drive away monkeys or vasectomise them.The forest department is entrusted with the task of catching monkeys but it is confined to urban areas. In February 2016, the department gave permission with riders to kill the wild boars affecting farming in hills.Killing wild boars is not an easy task. In the absence of trained hunters, the order is meaningless said Ratan Aswal of village Mirchoda."

The programme started in December last year and germination has begun in the area, the state horticulture department said. It added that the crop will be ready by February.Usually, this area gets vegetables around April, but by using this technology we can get vegetables by February. This will also meet the demand (for vegetables), said Deen Mohammad Khan, district horticulture officer, Gurgaon.The horticulture department said it has plans to extend the programme to crops affected by a bad monsoon too. It could stabilise the prices that go up every year around the time due to disrupted supply.Under this method, tunnels are dug within five to six feet of each other and soil preparation is done before sowing, which started in December.We have sowed cucumber, melons, watermelons, bitter gourds, squashes and snake gourds that are easy to grow in these tunnels. The low tunnels get better sunlight, ventilation and get water through drip irrigation. The tunnels are suitable for growing tomatoes, cucumbers and melons, said Khan.In one acre, a farmer can earn Rs2.5 to Rs3 lakh per harvest and the setup can be used for three years without tilling the land, he added.The mulching procedure involves simple techniques to create the tunnels. Bamboo sticks are tied to plastic sheets in a semi-circular structure to support the growing vegetable. Another plastic sheet is then placed on the structure to trap sunlight inside and create an optimal temperature for the crop to grow. The covered layer also reduces water loss and eliminates growth of weeds.At present, 160 farmers are with us in this programme. Our target is to increase this number by five times to serve the entire population of Gurgaon, said Khan."

As a result, prices of vegetables will be high till Durga Puja, said a member of Hatibagan Bazar Byabsayi Samiti advisory committee, Abhijit Saha, to The Indian Express.Saha also said procuring vegetables from wholesale markets has not been easy in recent days.We are not getting enough vegetables from wholesale markets. Farmers who have already stored the vegetables are unable to send them due to the flood, he added.The price of tomatoes is hovering around Rs 90 to Rs 100 per kg, rising from Rs 60 to Rs 70 a few days earlier. The price of brinjal (eggplant) has gone up to Rs 40 to Rs 50 per kg, while earlier it was around Rs 20 to Rs 30. The price of cucumber went up to Rs 60 per kg, which vegetable sellers had earlier sold at Rs 30 per kg.During monsoon season, the prices of vegetables get higher, and there was no exception this year. However, the recent flood in several districts has forced prices to go up further. With the situation persisting, the prices of vegetables will not come down soon, said Rabindranath Koley, general secretary of Forum of Traders Organisation of Paschimbanga (FTOP).The general secretary of Maniktala Market, Prabhat Das, agreed with the prediction.In this kind of situation, the prices of vegetables go up automatically, he said. The price of pointed gourd, which had earlier been Rs 20 to Rs 25 per kg, is now Rs 40. The price of papaya has also gone up to Rs 30 per kg, while earlier it was Rs 20 per kg.For all the latest Kolkata News, download Indian Express App"

Madurai Central Market Association secretary G Thiagarajan said that the tomato supply was high this year due to the good rainfall during the cultivation season. If there is no rain this winter during the harvest season, not just tomatoes but even onions, which have been hovering at more than Rs 100 per kilogram for the last six months, will come down to about Rs 20 or less, he said.President of the Central Market Association, R S P Sekhar said that the supplies had dropped to about 4,000 boxes of 15 kilograms each in November this year, but suddenly there was a surge and on Friday, when 7,000 to 8,000 boxes of tomatoes arrived at the market.A box of 15 kilograms was sold at Rs 70 on Friday and is expected to go down further, he said. The wholesale price for the tomato is Rs 5 to 6 based on the quality of the fruit. Traders say that a cold storage facility would help them to conserve the fruits at least for a day or two when there is excess supply, failing which they have to throw away the damaged or crushed fruit, which will start rotting immediately.While the market had depended on supplies of tomatoes and onions from the other states about a month ago to meet the demand, now local supply has become plentiful. K Palaniyandi a farmer from Dindigul said that there was a good harvest this time, but it would not fetch them a good profit, as they had to sell the picked fruits and traders named their price.Meanwhile, retailers are selling tomatoes at Rs10 a kilogram, in many parts of the city. We need a margin of atleast Rs 4 otherwise we do not make any profit, said Sankarapandian of Anna Nagar."

Koyambedu Vegetable Market Association advisor V R Soundararajan said tomato prices came down from Rs 40 to a range of Rs 15 to Rs 20 over the past 10 days.There was crop damage due to rains earlier but now there is some decent production. Only 20% to 25% of the reduction in tomato price may be due to abundance but it is more because of other vegetable prices going down too.

MukeshOUT OF ORDER: The defunct cold storage at Tamar near Ranchi. Picture by Manob ChowdharyRanchi: The shabby building on the edge of NH-33 in Tamar block of Ranchi is a cruel reminder of what the state government could have done to help residents of what is called the vegetable bowl of Jharkhand.It is meant to be a cold storage facility. Only, it never worked. If it did farmers would not have to routinely dump their produce, primarily tomatoes, on the highway every year between January and March because of low demand and poor prices.""Last year, I had to throw away over 40kg of tomatoes on the road. Wholesalers were offering me a meagre 50 paise per kg while tomatoes were selling in retail markets for more than Rs 7 a kg,"" Jagdish Mahto, a farmer from nearby Bundu, told The Telegraph.Mahto, who threw away his produce in utter frustration and even staged a protest in Ranchi along with other farmers, said he did notice the building. ""I have been seeing it for the last six years but the cold storage never worked. It would have been a boon for us had it started.""Built on 10,000 sq feet on the banks of Kurkuri river in Tamar, around 60km from Ranchi, today, the facility peeps out of trees, frozen in time; a symbol of government apathy towards farmers. The local BDO had no idea and the agriculture department was quick to dismiss suggestions that it had anything do with it.Finally, after being redirected to various departments, The Telegraph zeroed in on Ranchi district welfare officer Arun Manjhi who conceded they were the custodians of the defunct cold storage in Tamar. But he couldn't throw any light on its future.Tribal welfare commissioner Gauri Shankar Minz vaguely recalled its construction, but couldn't say why it wasn't working. ""I will have to check the files. I will take appropriate action,"" he promised.BDO Maruti Minz said he was new to Tamar. ""I have been posted at Tamar for two years but the cold storage was built earlier. I don't have the files, hence don't know anything,"" he said.Chairman of the horticulture department at Birsa Agriculture University K.K. Jha said a cold storage in Tamar would have helped farmers of Ranchi, Seraikela-Kharsawan and East Singhbhum districts who also grow cauliflower, cabbage, beans and ladyfinger.""A cold storage is particularly helpful for tomatoes as these don't last more than a day or two. Tomatoes are grown across Jharkhand, often produced in excess,"" he said.State horticulture director Rajiv Kumar said Jharkhand produced 40 lakh tonne vegetables against an annual requirement of 28 lakh tonne.""We are focusing on cold storages,"" he said. ""Last year, we sanctioned one each in Dhanbad, Bokaro and Giridih. Two more have been proposed in Sahebganj and Deoghar,"" he said."

As the government will not be in a position to announce a waiver at least for a few months, it has swung into action to ensure the indebted farmers are not hassled in getting a loan for seeds, fertilisers and pesticides essential for sowing, which will begin in first week of June, immediately after monsoon sets in. The government is thinking of purchasing seeds and fertilisers and distribute them with the help of NGOs and social organisations.The Opposition has been batting for a loan waiver for farmers similar to the one given in Uttar Pradesh. The Congress, NCP and four smaller parties boycotted proceedings of the Assemblys budget session for three weeks to push the demand. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had declared that his government, too, was in favour of the waiver, but at an appropriate time. He said his government was studying the UP model of a waiver. He also said that rather than a waiver, the thrust would be on sustainable development of agriculture.To reduce expenditure on farm labourers, the government is mulling funding them from the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS). We have not been able to fully utilise the central funds allocated under NREGS, but on the other hand, the cost of farm labourers is unbearable for farmers. By funding farm labour, we can extend a great relief to the farmers helping them to reduce cost of production. Similarly, on other fronts, too, we are tapping the possibilities to extend the benefits to the farmers, said an official from the agriculture department.The cooperation department is planning to restructure the loans given to the farmers to enable them to get fresh loans for the kharip season. The government is also considering health, education and housing schemes in the package so that the socio-economic burden is reduced.It will be a package of various schemes by 3 to 4 departments to ensure farmers are heavily subsidised to bring farming to the level of affordability. Right from testing of the soil health, sufficient supply of water, power supply at subsidised rates to effective marketing of the agriculture products, we are planning to do everything that will minimise the gap between the production cost and the rate in the market, Subhash Deshmukh, cooperation minister, told HT.The government is also tapping the idea of bring about 22 crops in the list of produce with minimum support price. It will bear the cost of difference between the market price and the MSP, particularly for crops such as tomato, onion and grapes, whose rates have fallen this year. Our aim is to bring cost of production to zero for about 1.07 lakh farmers who hold less than 5 acres of land. Instead of giving them money, the government will purchase the things required to cultivate and distribute with the help various organisations working in the sector, the officer said.According to rough estimates, the schemes will cost around Rs10,000 crore if implemented. But the estimates are primary, and depends on the feasibility of the all schemes being tapped. The schemes could be implemented if the government wins over the demand of the loan waiver, which is expected to cost Rs30,500 crore. But it succumbed to pressure for the waiver. It will have to cut short the schemes, another official from the cooperation department said.Read: Sangharsh Yatra: Waive loan before farmers lose patience, say Maharashtra opposition leadersMaharashtra Opposition intensifies attacks on govt, kicks off second Sangharsh Yatra for farm loan waiver"

He reportedly offered power to the state at Rs 1.75 per unit. The CM said he will review all power purchase agreements (PPAs) to assess the cost differential.In response to a suggestion by Ambani for introducing the metro rail service in Punjab as public-private partnership, the CM invited his firm to study the urban transport system in Ludhiana to explore the possibility of setting up an elevated metro.Ambani also sought land for setting up testing ranges for his firms new defence projects, while Goenka showed interest in setting up a tractor tyre plant in Punjab.The chief minister (CM) invited the industrialists to explore viability of their projects, assuring them of the governments support in providing land and other facilities.

Students are given lectures thrice a week on how to maintain the garden by urban farming groups like Start Upcycling Now (SUN) and iKheti, which helped the school to set up the garden.The project started in July 2016 after Father Gregory, the schools manager, roped in 240 students of Class 8 and explained the idea. Fascinated by the idea of having their own garden, the students immediately swung into action. Each class is divided into four sections and each division was assigned four gardens each.In a concrete jungle like Mumbai, a terrace garden awakens a sense of environmental consciousness and becomes a forum for knowledge. It also provides a variety of organic and fresh vegetables right at your doorstep, said Father Gregory.He added that a special period has been dedicated for the students to do the gardening work, which includes watering the plants, planting new vegetables, adding soil and compost or removing saplings, everything is done in the Work Experience period once a week.To execute the project, students created soil beds using clay bricks. A plastic sheet was spread on the brick base to prevent water from seeping through. Later, seven inch thick soil layer is spread on the plastic and is mixed with mulch comprising shredded cardboard and dry leaves. This helps soil to retain moisture even on the hot days.We should not just teach students phrases, but also make them apply those in real life. This is their real education. Now, they are so involved in it that they even utilise their recess time nurturing the plants, said Gracy Solomon, principal, OLPS.StudentspeakCommenting on the initiative, Razeen Sayyed, 13, said, We (each division) get 30 minutes with our respective gardens during which we must ensure that everything is fine with the crop. If everything is okay, and we are left with some time, we make self-irrigation bottles.The terrace garden produces brinjals, tomatoes, ladies fingers (okra), lemon grass, lemons and carom seeds (ajwain), which is appreciated not only by their treachers but also the monkeys who visit the garden in search of fresh vegetables.Monkeys eat our entire tomato crop. So to keep them at bay, we installed a scare crow, said Aaradhya Patil, 13.On each patch of garden, there are boards with information on the plants and their uses. For example, pentas plant is used as a popular medicine in malaria and lime to relieve asthma.Kids should understand how the plants are grown from scratch and that even a day of not watering can take away all their hard work, said Priyanka Shah, founder, iKheti, adding In this way, they also learn to respect food and become sensitive towards the environment.Organic fertilisersThe compost that they use in the garden comes from the waste created in the school campus. The school has eight drums in a set of four for each division where they dump organic waste, which is later used as fertiliser.Students do all the legwork they can for the environment. Aerobic composting is something that you just have to dump it and almost everything else is taken care of the microorganisms. The students of the school make sure that no waste goes out to the dump yard from the school, said Natasha DCosta, SUN founder.After the crop comes to fruition, the saplings are handed over to the students. Sanket Gauri, a student of Class VIII, said, We showed it to our parents and friends, and now even they want to be a part of it. My neighbours liked it so much that they want to start gardening on our terrace as well.The students are not just young environmentalists, but they are exceptional in studies as well. They recently won a Science Club Competition last year.My favourite subject is Maths, but this [terrace gardening] is Science, Chemistry, Geography and all other subjects put to practice, said Essakkimuthu Konar, 14, as he held his self-irrigation bottle with his name labelled on it.Also read: Teen powers change, helps buildings, schools recycle 350 kg of batteries"

In its first two years, the government cleared more economic reforms  including deregulating diesel prices, cutting cooking gas subsidy and making it easier for companies to exit business  than in the last five years of the previous government. Millions more have been brought into the countrys banking system and the government has pushed digitisation.In the latest budget, the government also announced incentives to labour-intensive sectors such as clothing and leather along with spending more on projects like roads, railways, low-cost housing and irrigation.I will give the Prime Minister two out of 10. Even 2 seems two much. I feel like giving only one. Modis foreign policy is good . The one point is just for that.But Modis critics say much of this is old wine in a new bottle, minor cosmetic tweaks that havent put India on the path of a paradigm shift the prime minister had promised.Economic growth hasnt created enough jobs because of lack of investment, income inequality has grown, farm distress has soared and the cash ban has only worsened the economic outlook in the immediate term. Credit to industry remains flat and, despite higher farm credit target, disbursement levels have dipped as banks seek to avoid bad loans.Even for some Modi fans like Rambir Rathi, a sugarcane farmer in Uttar Pradeshs Baghpat, the dream of achhe din is coming unstruck.I voted for Modi. Farmers like us were promised Rs 500 for a quintal of sugarcane instead of the Rs 315 we were receiving then. I believed in him, says the father of two.They told us our dues would be paid by the sugar mill owners but look what has happened. The rate is the same. Our dues remain unpaid.Asked to rate Modis governance of more than two years, Rathi gives the prime minister two on 10.Do bhi jyada hai. Mann toh nahin karta hai ek bhi dene ko (Even two is too much. I dont feel like giving him even one), he says, adding Modi had only done well on dealing with Pakistan.But farms in distressWith mounting debt, poverty, increasing health cost and other ballooning farming-related expenses, farm incomes dropped 50%-70% over the past years. And just farmers hoped to claw back from two years of back-to-back drought, the government ordered a disruptive currency ban that squeezed the largely cash-only agriculture sector.Farm prices crashed as farmers dumped tomatoes and potatoes onto the streets, fed unharvested crop to cattle and farm hands sat idle. A farm loan write-off for two months after demonetisation hardly helped, some economists say.Februarys budget raised the farm credit target to by 11.1% to Rs 10-lakh crore in 2017-18 but, in reality, bank lending to farmers has dropped and the distribution of credit has focussed on a handful of relatively better-off states.Expenditure on agriculture is seen rising marginally to Rs 2.06-lakh crore in 2017/18, but this in real terms might signal a decline.Fewer jobsSigns of distress are clear in cities as well. Sharp rises in education and healthcare costs in the last two years have hit Indias burgeoning middle class hard, denting Modis popularity among the relatively well-off.Today, India stands before a unique moment in history: It could choose to squander its immense potential with its antiquated socio-political system, corruption and flighty business rules or build on its cultural heritage, democratic values and a young demography to transform the lives of its 1.25 billion citizens.To begin with, two decades on, nothing less than a $10 trillion economy will secure Indias future, says a recent study by Pricewaterhouse Coopers( PwC). It will have to create jobs on a scale that can absorb 10-12 million people who join the workforce every year, including members of the emerging middle class  a billion strong by 2034.Read | Achhe din will come only after 2019, Cong working on it: Rahul GandhiBut only 135,000 jobs were created in 2015 -- the lowest total in seven years and 67% lower than the number created in the last year of the previous government. In one quarter of 2016-17, for which official data is available, only 77,000 jobs were created  and of these 50,000 were government jobs.The gloom is affecting the youth.Chartered accountant Omprakash Sethia in Bhopal.

It seems there is no monitoring system in the country. I am hugely disappointed, says Omprakash Sethia of Bhopal.I thought there would be a boom on the job front but despite emphasis on digital India I dont see many job avenues, says Subhanshu Sethia, a commerce student in Bhopal.The demonetisation move worsened the plight of the vulnerably placed in the labour market in several ways, the most stress arising out of closure of establishments in the informal sector.Back in Pandra Sikanpur, Singh says he will think twice about voting for Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the next general elections scheduled for 2019.That view is far from universal, but is already on the radar of a government, which swept to power with promises of economic reforms and pro-business policies that appealed to aspirational Indians living in big towns and cities.Modi has already started turning his attention to the hinterlands. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley this month said the government will spend a record amount on rural areas and farming to help double farmers income by 2022.But Singh is unimpressed.Narendra Modi stressed on jobs during his speeches in general election. Where are those jobs? he asks.I know how I feel is how many many more Indians feel.(With inputs from Ranjan Srivastava and Sumanta Ray Chaudhuri)"

The commission also expected a status report within six weeks on supply of piped water, especially at the villages, where incidents of the kidney diseases had been identified.The number of the diseased will be known once the government submits the status report.The commission has, in its order, further directed the state health department to report within four weeks as to whether dialysis machines have been provided to the hospitals at the blocks with all infrastructure facilities.Official sources said the district administration had, in February 2011, conducted investigations in the blocks with rural water supply and sanitation wing twice following media reports. But, the cause behind the incidents of kidney diseases could not be ascertained.Investigations by the Indian Council of Medical Research's Regional Medical Research Centre had indicated that contamination of land by minerals and industrial effluents or fertilisers and pesticides could possibly be the reason behind the disease.A team from the centre had, in April 2012, undertaken epidemiological investigation into the reported cases of kidney failures.""People at these villages depend on farming for their livelihood. Since the villages are situated adjacent to the Mahanadi riverbank as well as foothill areas, the land is likely to have minerals and industrial effluent contamination via river water from the upland areas. Besides, people grow vegetables such as cabbage, beans, brinjal, tomatoes and legumes. Consumption of pulses and legumes is apparently higher. Use of fertilisers and pesticides are also prevalent risk in this area,"" the centre report had said."

Its good to dump our crop on the road, he said.While some farmers blamed it on demonetisation and cash crunch, Shajapur mandi secretary Rajesh Mishra dismissed the allegations, saying high supply and low demand had caused the prices to fall.The Madhya Pradesh government had announced facilities such as cash vans and transport subsidy for farmers to face cash crunch, but farmers claimed they are yet to receive them.According to sources, the daily supply of tomatoes at Shajapur mandi is around 200 to 300 crates as many farmers are sending their crop directly to Bhopal and Indore markets.They claimed that the rates were decent at Indore and Bhopal mandis."

Farmers of Bhandra, Kero, Kuru and Senha blocks of Lohardaga district and in Ranchi and other parts of the country Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradeshhave been dumping their tomatoes, onions and French beans.Huge dumps of vegetables were seen along Ranchi-Tata highway (NH-33) near Bhuinyadih vegetable market in Ranchis Tamar block after having been forced to sell their produce at throwaway prices because of bumper crop and cash crunch.The National Institution for Transforming India (Niti) Aayog in a recent paper admitted to the slump in vegetable prices, but attributed it to the bumper crop and not demonetisation of Rs 500/1000 notes.We are in catch-22 situation. Traders are not buying our produce. We neither able to sell the vegetable nor to take it at home, Jaipal Singh Munda, a tomato farmer, said.Jagdish Mahato, a trader at Bhuinyadih wholesale market, said, Tomatoes and French beans are being sold at Rs 1-2 a kg in the market while cauliflower is Rs 5 a piece for last few days.However, the price of tomato is Rs 6-10 a kg, French beans and cauliflower Rs 10 in vegetable markets in Ranchi city.With good monsoon this year, farmers have produced bumper crops in the country.Traders purchasing power has declined after demonetisation. They have restricted their orders. West Bengal traders are not coming to buy vegetables from Jharkhand at this time, said Nakul Mahato, a vegetable grower from Ranchis Pithoria area, who also sells vegetables to West Bengal.State horticulture director Rajiv Kumar said Jharkhand recorded bumper crops this year. So, it is natural the demand will fall. We are trying to increase the demand through advertising significance of tomato on health.He said residents would be requested to buy tomato and store them as ketchup.Next year onwards, vegetable route will also be defined where farmers will be requested to produce different vegetables so that farmers do not see such situation, he said.Jharkhand is a known for surplus vegetable production. According to Jharkhand state horticulture mission (JSHM), the state produces around 38 lakh metric tonne vegetables annually against a requirement of 30 lakh metric tonne. The state exports around one million tonne vegetables to other states every year."

Picture by Anirban ChoudhuryAlipurduar: A project funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) to boost collective farming systems for marginal and tenant cultivators by focusing on improved water management and irrigation practices has started yielding results.The project, started by the Uttar Bongo Krishi Vishwavidyalaya in 2014 and covering women among the marginal farmers, identified two villages in north Bengal - Dhaolaguri in Cooch Behar and Uttar Chakoakheti in Alipurduar district.Another highlight of the scheme was to minimise crop damage from elephants. The researchers suggested the cultivation of mustard, something the jumbos do not like, and now large numbers of farmers have taken to the crop.Each village is divided into three sites under the project to promote collective farming and mutual benefit-sharing. As part of the scheme, social mobilisation is also fostered through a series of community meets, group discussions and gender-awareness sessions held from time to time.An annual review meeting of the project was held on Tuesday in Alipurduar. Twenty delegates from four countries, including scientists from Uttar Bango Krishi Visya Vidyalaya, were present at the review.Addressing a news conference, Rupak Sarkar, a professor of the Krishi Vishwavidyalaya, said: ""The ACIAR provided (Australian) $82,000 for the five-year project.

In the eastern Gangetic plains (which covers Bengal), marginal and tenant farmers play a crucial role in ensuring food security and socio-economic uplift,"" Sarkar said.""A big challenge is to empower such marginal and tenant farmers by improving water-use efficiency. The project mainly helps farmers to produce crops during the dry season and teach them how to use water scientifically for cultivation,"" Sarkar added.According to the professor, the project also promotes ""protected cultivation"" and last year, farmers cultivated vegetables in polyhouse - enclosures made of transparent hardened polythene sheets - successfully and profitably. Crops under the project include summer paddy, wheat, maize, mustard, winter vegetables like potato, cabbage, cauliflower, garlic, chilli, and tomatoes.""We are creating awareness among villagers regarding the benefits they could enjoy from government schemes. We have given shallow tube-wells with pumpsets and polyhouses. More important, in three sites, we have set up pumpsets run by solar energy. They are cost-effective. Otherwise, the villagers have to carry diesel over 7km (from the nearest fuel outlet),"" Sarkar said.Mustard crops have helped too. ""Last year, we saw that elephants do not eat mustard and this year many farmers are cultivating it. At the same time, we will intimate forest officials (about crop damage) as elephant depredation is on the increase.""Erik Schmidj, the project in-charge from Australia, visited the area on Monday. ""We are initiating similar projects in Bihar (Madhubani district), Nepal and Bangladesh. We are satisfied with the progress of the project (in the two north Bengal areas) and we have another two years to go (for the five-year pl;an). Our plan is to motivate the villagers to get the benefits,"" Schmidj said.""Famers are innovative and it is a community-based project. Our plan is to spread the benefits from the two villages (Dhaolaguri and Chakoakheti) to other areas. Now the villagers can cultivate three to four crops in a year instead of only one in a year earlier,"" Schmidj added.Suren Chikbaraik, a farmer of Uttar Chakoakheti, said he and others "" earlier cultivated only rice"". ""But from last year, we are cultivating at least four crops in a year.""Chikbaraik added: Elephant depredation was a daily phenomena in the village and they used to damage crops. Last year, we cultivated mustard. We saw that the elephant damage wheat plants but do not touch the mustard in the adjacent field. Now we cultivate vegetables in polyhouse and even in winter also."""

To begin with, there are these walkers, invariably chattering on their cellphone, as they keep rambling all over the walkway, like uncontrolled wheels, trundling from a hilltop. Actually, there are many like them, who, like slithering serpents, walk in zigzag manner, blocking themselves and others, too.Then there are those, splaying hands and flailing their arms sideways, reminding you of birds, ready to take off on flights. Some try walking, flapping only their fingers, as if they are drumming on invisible dholaks. You also see those walkers with hands stretched skyward, looking like they would pull and pluck some green foliage from low-hung tree branches anytime.And then, there are those running with random handclaps, as if they are into swatting of menacing mosquitoes. Some try racing on reverse gear, too, running backward. Heaven help if they slide into booby traps, in the form of deluding pits slickly covered by dry leaves. Then you see those, running with rhythmic forward thrust of their clenched fists, as if parrying attacks by imaginary muggers. Some run with closed fists, too, constantly criss-crossing on their chest, looking like chest-thumping patriots.Next, you have those uber amicable walkers, full of beans and brio, with beatific smiles and bountiful warmth. Of course, some walk like automatons, too, with impassive eyes, fully transfixed on ground below, that you fear the earth would open a chasm anytime. In fact, many strollers walk with such singular seriousness, sporting that staid/stoical look that you feel they are managing a massive mountain on their head.And then, there are those with lackadaisical gait, walking with such languor and lassitude as if lugging behind a load of bricks. If some walkers have their hands swinging like oscillating pendulums; some have their derrires swaying, walking like sassy ramp models, sashaying on runways. In contrast to this, there are those with waddling gait, walking like penguins.There are those who seem like they are making great leaps with vigorous limb movements. But they'd be stuck in same spot, sans any progress, like the huffing and puffing static train, refusing to budge. In contrast, you have those with bounding strides, as if they are bouncing out of a building on a blazing fire.Finally, I too have my own whacky jogging style.

I did not sleep a wink that night, the night before I had to fly to my new home in USA.Thirty-two years since I left my childhood home, I wonder at the huge changes yet everything seems frozen in time in Bangalore. The moon winks at me in the dark night but my jet-lagged body reminds me of pangs of lunch hunger. The airports have changed but it is still the same warm moist air enveloping me as I walk out of the jet way. The long line of taxis is competing with the Olas, Ubers and luxury coaches ready to ship my tired body home. The tiny tea stalls displaced by modern coffee shops, the familiar telephone booths now obsolete with Wi-Fi welcoming you as you step out. I cant wait to take a ride on the gargantuan swanky Metro line snaking the city on the long drive to south Bangalore.As nights yawn into breezy and often hot mornings I saunter in Lal Bagh and Krishna Rao Park, peppered with the sounds of birds and scooting squirrels. I watch with fascination the young ones, ajjis, tatas, aunties, uncles, didis, chachas and smile as I catch snippets of conversations of politics, the latest in films, dowries paid, weddings, traffic, garbage, the latest elections and everything under the moon.I do my ubiquitous duty of shopping on just about anything I could set my eyes on.

My wife composed this mantra, mostly because of her fear of coming in contact with any of those items in a non-Indian restaurant.It was kind of assumed that the Indian restaurants in the US also had two kitchens to cater to the vegetarian and non-vegetarian eating customers and also understood the seriousness of serving a non-vegetarian dish to a vegetarian customer! Of course, we never checked if any of the Indian restaurants did have two kitchens.We are vegetarians but not vegans (vegans do not eat and/or use animal products). So, meat was completely ruled out. The restaurants would then take extra precautions and ensure that the dishes would not come in contact with meat and did not have any meat products in them.Even the sauces being used in the Mexican and Asian dishes, some of which are oyster-based, would be replaced with vegetarian options. The pizza cutters would be cleaned with soap before being run over our pizzas. Of course, we would generously tip the stewards and sometimes the chef too, for their extra attention to these details.My wife became suspicious once when she was served a funny looking 'tomato' slice at a leading pizza joint in Hawaii. She had placed the order with a 'no meat' instruction. But when the pizza arrived, the 'tomato' slice not only looked stale but smelt horrible, too. (No offense to all the meat lovers!)In most cases, I would be asked to play the role of a guinea pig to taste the food for quality checks. With this pizza, however, I did not muster the courage to be one; what if that piece was from a pig? Strange it would have been then - 'a pig for a guinea pig'!My wife's dislike for eggs is mostly psychological and goes back to her childhood days. In order to make her strong and healthy, she was offered eggs (as recommended by the family physician), much to her dislike. She would, however, throw it up after few minutes. That feeling must have stayed with her ever since, for even now, a cookie with the slightest hint of egg is rejected at the plate itself.With regard to her dislike for mushrooms, the story is less complicated. Since it is a fungus, it has been easily placed in the 'do not eat' list.Cut to present. Having relocated to India, I have not heard that mantra for a long time. She has, instead, come up with a modified version to suit the environment here. ""Is this chutney made from RO Water?"" She is also a SPOC; no, not a 'Single Point of Contact' but a 'Sanitiser Point of Contact'!"

As soon as the pan hit the heat, he added a generous portion of melted butter. Simultaneously (multitasking with much ease), he broke in a couple of eggs into a bowl, followed by an array of not-so-finely diced ingredients, and his secret ingredient black pepper. With an up-and-down as well as back-and-forth motion, he then beat the hell out of them until there was no strand of white or yellow.""This is going to be the perfect omelette,"" I thought to myself. After a long leave that I had happily sanctioned my cook, soon after which I fell sick, our kitchen had turned into a dismal wasteland. But the man of the house aimed to do something productive in the kitchen that day.But it was when the eggs produced a loud satisfying sizzle on the pan, that I critically questioned my insights. ""Wait a minute! Tell me you didn't tell me that you 'don't know how to cook'!"" I exclaimed. He smirked extravagantly wriggling his elbows and body, and then drawling to me he said, ""Don't know, yah.""After five years of sharing our lives, I had just come to terms with the fact that he's probably never going to make the kitchen a romantic place to be. And yet, here he was, regaling in harmony amid broken egg shells and inedible onion skins.Whilst I coughed away to glory, he gracefully plated up a perfect, bright-yellow, butter-doused omelette with a sprinkle of pepper and a burst of colourful veggies that looked warm, earthy and inviting.Unwittingly following the pattern of a triangle as we sat at the dining table, the three of us began consuming the omelette effectively. As my husband and I recounted the story of ""I don't know how to cook"" and laughed out loud, while also praising the newly discovered sneaky chef, it was obvious that our three-year-old daughter didn't like this kind of commotion at the table. She preferred her mother giving her the fullest attention. I then cut a perfect triangle and speared a morsel of omelette into her mouth and asked, ""Happy now?""Of course, while I can't say enough good things about our new chef's debut performance, one thing is certain.

In just one village, Parsuli, an estimated 100 quintals was either fed to cattle or left to rot in the crop fields. After a relatively better marketing season that lasted till the first week of January, retail prices plunged.Far away, farmers in Erode district in Tamil Nadu were a worried lot after the retail price of cabbage crashed. From Rs 12/kg last year, it dropped to as low as Re 1 per kg. In Chhattisgarh, too, tomato prices crashed, leaving farmers in the lurch.Not fetching more than Rs 2 per kg, farmers simply abandoned the tomato harvest. The deplorable price they get in the market is not even enough to meet the plucking and harvesting cost.This is primarily because of higher production. Whether it is cabbage, tomato, potato, onions or any other crop, the higher the production, lower is the price. A higher production enables middlemen to form cartels and manipulate prices, often to the extent of exploitation.T Rajaganesh, a farmer in Erode district, asks: ""Farmers spend at least Rs 45,000 per acre a month to cultivate cabbage. Add to it the cost of labour, maintenance and fertiliser, and the cost shoots up to more than Rs 50,000 a month.Since it takes almost three months to yield, we have to spend at least Rs 1.5 lakh per acre before harvesting. How can we realise a profit with a farmgate price of Rs 1 per kg?""In the case of tomato too, average cost of production is about Rs 90,000-1 lakh per acre for small farmers. For the big farms, the production cost is a little higher, at Rs 1.25 lakh per acre.Till the first week of January, when I travelled to meet tomato farmers in Durg, the prices were much better - about Rs 1,000 per crate of 25 kg. But, with the advent of tomato crop from Karnataka, the supplies swelled, and prices slumped.Now, let's take the case of chana. According to news reports, chana prices are ruling at about Rs 3,600 per quintal, against the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 4,400 per quintal, a drop of 20% in the retail price.With production expected to increase to 10 million tonnes this year (from 9.33 million tonnes last year), prices are expected to dip with arrivals picking up. Even wheat price has remained below MSP by 6-8% in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, where early crop harvest hit the mandis.In February last week, market price for tur dal was ruling at Rs 4,500 per quintal, against the procurement price of Rs 5,500 at Tandur market in Telangana.Meanwhile, reports of tomato being dumped on the streets in Chhattisgarh poured in again in early March. This is the third year in a row when tomato prices have crashed to Re 1 per kg. In fact, this is the third year in a row when prices of almost all agricultural commodities have crashed across the country.Karnataka modelAfter two years of drought in 2014 and 2015, production picked up after a favourable monsoon in 2016 and 2017. While the increase in production has brought cheers to the government, the drop in prices has added to the misery of farmers.It is here that I see the relevance of a very timely suggestion made by Dr TN Prakash, chairman of the Karnataka Agricultural Prices Commission. He has called for making the Minimum Support Price of crops to be legally binding. He said: ""Consumers have legal protection if produce is sold above MRP and can approach the courts. But, even after 70 years of Independence, farmers don't have similar protection.""For the third year in a row, prices of almost all commodities are at 20-45% lower than MSP in various parts of the country. At times of glut, traders ruthlessly exploit farmers. Even the introduction of the Unified Market Platform in Karnataka, which led to the expansion of 585 eNAM (National Agricultural Market) throughout the country, farmers have not gained.The concept of model price, which is based on the average of the day's trading, is in reality a distress price and needs to be dispensed with. eNAM in reality is a nationwide platform being created to make it profitable for spot trading.In addition to 23 crops for which MSP is announced every year, state governments must work out MSP for highly perishable commodities like tomato, potato, onion and other vegetables.Many states already have a Farmers' Commission, which has more or less become retiring rooms for political appointees.The immediate need is to convert them into State Agricultural Prices Commission, with the mandate to provide higher income to farmers, similar to that in Karnataka. If Karnataka can ensure procurement of 14 crops at prices much higher than the MSP announced by the Centre, I see no reason why other states cannot."

Every Sunday, Dheeraj drives to Badshahpur on the outskirts of the city, where he - along with over a hundred other Gurugrammers - works as a farmer in his own farm, growing everything, from tomatoes and strawberries. Community organic farming is finding popularity among the working class of the Millennium City, who are not averse to getting their hands dirty in the mud and engage in farming. Currently, over 100 families from across the city are engaged in the practice on leased farms in Badshahpur in a project started by the District Horticulture Department and supported by a local NGO, Green Leaf Initiative.The project was started in October last year by the Gurgaon District Horticulture Officer Deen Mohammad Khan, and was expanded after it gained popularity. Khan tells us, ""We offer technical support and expertise to farmers here. The residents have formed a community on WhatsApp, leasing 52 farms in Badshahpur, where they grow all sorts of vegetables, fruits, herbs, and varieties of flowers.""Khan adds, ""The idea was to create a space where Gurgaon residents could be closer to nature and promote organic community farming."" Khan's department provides the technical expertise and advice to budding farmers and has also facilitated hiring of 10 labourers to assist the residents in their farms. They are all paid using the fees from the residents. All the practices of farming are completely organic.Vishal Johri is a CBI officer and works on his farm on weekends""Our farm is leased by us four partners and we divide work and responsibilities. That reduces the workload and attention we need to give,"" says Vishal Johri, a city resident who works with the CBI. But before you rush to book a farm for yourself, keep in mind that not only are all the plots already booked, there is also a long waiting to get one. ""The lease to residents is for six months. The current one expires in March when they will be up for renewal, but despite that, I get so many requests every week and have to say no to everyone. I am now looking for more farms in other locations of the city,"" says Khan. All the 'farmers' involved in the project are Gurgaon-based working professionals. ""Some are IT people, some are senior corporate professionals. We even have doctors and engineers,"" says Khan. South City 2 resident Shikha Gaur says, ""We read about all the poison we are ingesting through pesticides and growth hormones used in the vegetables and fruits available in the market and we wanted an alternative to that.""Shikha Gaur is a corporate event planner and prefers her self grown fresh vegetables and fruits over the market's produce (BCCL/ Ajay Kumar Gautam)Dr Jyoti Wadhwa , a city-based doctor, says, ""As doctors, my husband and I are well aware of the dangers and increased risk of cancer due to intake of vegetables and fruits laden with chemicals.

It is a great learning experience for our children as well, for whom, this is all very new and different.""These urban farmers say that over the months, their farms have become so productive that they are now reaping about 20kg of fruits and vegetables every week. Amit Takkar, an entrepreneur who comes to his farm every Sunday, tells us, ""I've stopped buying produce from the market. I started with vegetables like tomatoes, potatoes, cabbages, etc. and now I have even sown strawberries. I want to be able to grow all the food I eat right here.""

(Source: PTI Photo) Arun Jaitley, along with Union Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan, Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog Arvind Panagariya and CEO, NITI Aayog, Amitabh Kant releasing the book India: Three Year Action Agenda at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi. (Source: PTI Photo)Last month, the NITI Aayog released the Three Year Action Agenda (TYAA) for the government, a roadmap for reforming the various sectors of the economy. Here we look at its agenda for the agriculture sector, and how best it can rescue the sector whose growth has plunged to just 1.8 per cent annually in the first three years of the NDA government.In doing so, we also touch upon the recommendations of some important committees constituted by the current government in the realm of agri-food. These are the High Level Committee (HLC) on Management of Foodgrains and Restructuring FCI (headed by Shanta Kumar, January 2015), the Task Force on Agriculture headed by the Vice-Chairman of the NITI Aayog (May 2016) and the four volumes (out of 14) of the Committee on Doubling of Farmers Income (August 2017). The government, thus, has ample reference points for reforming the food and agriculture sector.The TYAA basically talks of action pertaining, first, to increasing productivity of land and water, second to reforming agri-markets on the lines of e-NAM, third, reforming tenancy laws, and finally, relief measures during natural disasters. There is nothing new  and nothing wrong  in these recommendations; they have been made by the committees cited above. The TYAA, however, does not prioritise policy actions, nor does it talk about the role of trade policy in agriculture, or reforming the massive system of food and fertiliser subsidies. Nevertheless, the hard question is whether the government is ready to bite the bullet.We think urgent action is needed on five fronts and list them in order of priority. First, the government needs to improve the profitability of cultivation by getting markets right, second, it needs to invest in water to fulfil its slogan of har khet ko pani and more crop per drop, its third priority should be Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) of food and fertiliser subsidies to the accounts of targeted beneficiaries, which can release resources for investments, fourth it should ensure that the new Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) delivers compensation to farmers in time, and finally, it should free up land lease markets. Let us elaborate on these points a bit.By now it is clear that the policy of minimum support prices (MSPs)  and the promise of 50 per cent profits over costs in the BJPs election manifesto of 2014  has not improved profitability of cultivation in the last three years. In fact, farmers returns have gone down in the case of most crops. The situation is worse for producers of basic vegetables like potatoes, onions and tomatoes. Prices of these crops during harvest time plunged to about Rs 2 per kg in the last season while the consumers were still paying Rs 15 to Rs 20 per kg. Attempts to reform the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) markets on the lines of the model act of 2003, and now through the Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing Act, 2017, have not achieved much success.However, India has shown in the case of milk, through Operation Flood  a la the AMUL model  that farmers can get 70-80 per cent of the price paid by consumers. Why then cant we have Operation Veggies on similar lines? A beginning can be made with at least onions, potatoes and tomatoes. That would require buying directly from farmers groups (FPOs), setting up logistics from grading, storage to movement, and linking them to organised retail (including e-retail), large processors and exporters. But to do all this, the government will have to commit not only enough resources as it did for Operation Flood but also change certain laws, including the Essential Commodities Act (ECA).The e-NAM scheme, which is supposed to create an all India market, in order to ensure better prices to farmers, has not succeeded in its endeavour so far. Software is still being installed in mandis to enable them to switch auctions from the shouting platform to the electronic ones. Inter-mandi and inter-state transactions are very rare. However, an easier way to improve farmers profitability is to open up exports of all agri-products, without any restrictions, and allowing private trade to build global value chains, keeping the ECA in abeyance. This would require a change from the current pro-consumer approach to one that is focussed on farmers.Second is the issue of investments, especially in water. The Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana is mandated to complete 99 irrigation projects by 2019, which will bring 76 lakh ha additional area under irrigation. NABARD, with Rs 40,000 crore as Long-Term Irrigation Fund, is to help states in completing these projects. It would be a commendable achievement for the government if it can complete these projects as planned. But open canal systems with flood irrigation dont give high water-use efficiency.It is time to accord higher priority to micro-irrigation (drip and sprinklers) to achieve the objective of more crop per drop. Israel and the US could be good examples to follow: Israel has the highest proportion (99 per cent) of its irrigated area under micro-irrigation while the US has largest absolute area (15 m ha) under micro-irrigation (See graph).The third area for action should be DBT of food and fertiliser subsidies. The HLC has already provided a roadmap in this respect. Rs 30,000 to Rs 50,000 crores can be saved each year, which can be invested in water resources and upgrading marketing infrastructure.The fourth area is ensuring that the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) delivers. Currently, several states dont pay premium in time, dont conduct crop cutting experiments, and as a result, farmers suffer long delays in getting any compensation. These lacunae can be fixed through modern technology and better governance, provided there is a champion in the government to deliver.The last suggestion would be to free up land lease markets for long periods. China allows land lease for 30 years so that corporate bodies can work with farmers, bringing in their best expertise, inputs and investments.

To start with, they seem to be concentrated in the relatively more prosperous agriculture belts  the stretch from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune to Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur in Western Maharashtra and Neemuch, Mandsaur and Ratlam in MPs Malwa region. Farmers here grow a range of commercial crops. They are also largely from progressive agricultural communities such as Marathas and Patidars. These farmers  unlike their brethren in drought-prone Marathwada, Vidarbha or Bundelkhand, who are largely into subsistence agriculture, and often resort to seasonal migratory employment  have seen good times, particularly through the first decade of this century till about 2013. This was a period of remunerative prices for most crops on the back of a global agri-commodity boom and domestic demand fuelled by rising incomes.The first setback to the above party came towards mid-2014, with the collapse of world commodity prices, leading to both falling exports and rising imports of farm products from the country. The current crisis, however, has to do more with domestic headwinds that may have some link with demonetisation. In virtually every crop marketed since November  whether soyabean, green gram, pigeon-pea and potatoes or tomato, onion, garlic, red chili, fenugreek, grapes and pomegranates  farmers have experienced huge price declines. The government claims this is mainly due to bumper production. But there is also a demand side. Produce trading in India is predominantly cash-based. The body blow this traditional agro-commercial capital has suffered due to demonetisation  and the inability of formal finance to fill the gap  may explain the apparent lack of liquidity in the markets now. With nobody really to buy and stock up, the speculative capital that used to buoy commodity prices has practically ceased to exist. And its farmers who have taken the ultimate hit.This situation is unsustainable, both politically and economically. But the solution cannot lie in farm loan waivers. Indebtedness is only the symptom of the actual disease, which is one of low prices and demand for produce. What the farm sector desperately needs is liquidity, which can come from institutional finance, modern agro-processing and organised retail, both domestic and foreign. While a zero GST rate on most primary farm produce is a welcome move, it needs to be supplemented with the removal of all restrictions on stockholding, domestic movement and exports. There is also a case to impose higher import duties, especially on pulses and edible oils, as a temporary measure. If there can be anti-dumping duties and minimum import prices on steel or float glass, why not for products from the farm  more so, in todays troubled times?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

(AP Photo/Rajesh Kumar Singh) Rag pickers look for reusable materials at a garbage dump littered with polythene bags in Lucknow. (AP Photo/Rajesh Kumar Singh)The challenge of solid waste management in Indian cities is now receiving belated but welcome attention and about time too. Rising incomes and changing lifestyles are generating more waste and of a different kind, but we are yet to set up systems to deal with the build-up. Swachh Bharat Mission provides an opening, but much more needs to be done on the ground.Waste was not such a problem in India until the 1970s. In our rural areas, food discards were returned to the soil. Food leftovers were fed to animals and the cattle-shed wastes were thrown in a pit to decompose and become manure for the next planting season. This returned both NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) nutrients as well as micronutrients to the soil for healthy crops.Urban food discards were also recognised as a potential resource, not a waste. In Portuguese Goa, bullock carts would move from bungalow to bungalow, collecting kitchen leftovers for on-farm composting. This was the earliest Indian version of doorstep waste collection. In big cities like Bangalore, farmers would bring their produce to town for early-morning auctions, then move to the cement-ring waste bins at street corners and empty them to take back home and produce manure. In fact, they would fight over collection rights for this fertile resource. This age-old practice kept Indian soils rich in carbon, up to 4 per cent.All this changed with the beginning of the plastic era in the 1970s. Some readers will recall how plastic bags were initially cherished as a useful item for hoarding in our homes, carefully taken out for re-use when needed. As the bags became more common, poor quality, and disposable, we began throwing them away into our kitchen waste-bins. When farmers took such mixed waste to their farms, the fields wore a non-biodegradable plastic film, preventing rain from entering the soil and keeping seeds from germinating through them  an example of negative urban-rural connectivity.Two useful resources, biodegradable waste and plastic, when mixed together, became waste and remained uncollected. Add to this the mixing of other dry waste and the debris from construction and demolition down the supply chain of waste, and this assorted mixed waste presents a major management challenge for the municipal authorities.City managers forced to deal with this growing waste began collecting and dumping the same outside the city limits. Since nearby farms and villages did not want this mixed waste either, it often ended up along the sides of roads leading out of town. These convenient ribbons of no mans land were not managed or defended by anyone. When even these filled up with ridges of waste, cities found larger areas outside to create mini hills of mixed waste.These rotting heaps of waste, denied oxygen from the air, emit methane (CH4) which is over 21 times more potent as a heat trapping gas than carbon dioxide. They generate ammonia which smells like dirty urinals and nauseating hydrogen sulphide which smells like rotten eggs. The airless heaps also produce leachate, a black liquid oozing out from the waste. Imagine a rotten tomato in a plastic bag which turns to a smelly liquid, unlike a similar rotten tomato which is left in the open air and dries to powder. This example illustrates the importance of aerating the waste heaps.Waste heaps without adequate exposure to air take 25-30 years to slowly decompose, continuously releasing methane and leachate. This leachate seeps down into the soil and contaminates open wells and after a longer time even reaches and pollutes bore wells through deep natural water channels. When waste is dumped in low-lying areas or quarry pits, the hydrostatic pressure of so much water-logging forces the leachate into water veins even faster. There is no way to treat this deep underground contamination, which makes wells and bore wells unfit for drinking and even for irrigation for decades.Households need to be made to stop mixing biodegradable waste with dry waste (paper, plastic, glass, etc) and keep hazardous domestic waste completely separate. The segregation of waste at source into wet (compostable), dry (recyclable) and sanitary (disposable diapers and sanitary napkins) categories is now compulsory for all citizens of India in the Solid Waste Management Rules 2016. However, residents typically complain that the waste is mixed again in the door-to- door collection process. While demanding high standards for door-to-door collection, we must continue with our discipline at home.In 2003, Suryapet in Andhra Pradesh was the first Indian city to process its wet waste, recycle its dry waste and leave nothing for landfilling. Vengrula in Maharashtra and Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu are the latest of over 20 urban local bodies to achieve near zero waste to landfill. The wet waste needs to be collected and processed daily, either composted at home or taken to nearby locations for decentralised composting or biogas production or taken to centralised plants. At the very least, the waste needs to be stabilised as described below. The correct way to manage fresh waste is to expose as much of it to air as soon as possible. Worldwide, the standard way of doing this is to unload the waste in windrows, not high heaps.Windrows are long low parallel heaps of waste, not more than two metres high, which are designed to achieve the best conditions for aerating the waste. Only parking-lot type management is required to guide incoming vehicles on where and how to unload their waste, moving slowly forward and leaving the waste behind in a long row. Enough space is left between rows for a lifting tractor or earthmover to drive through and turn the waste in the windrow.The outer aerated waste should form the inner core of a new windrow, and the airless centre of the old heap now on the outside. Weekly turning of the waste, repeated at least four times, ensures that all parts of the waste are fully decomposed, like leaves on a forest floor, turning dark brown and with a sweet earthy smell. The process can be speeded up by the addition of composting bio-cultures (fresh cow dung or substitutes available in the market).Fresh waste windrows heat up inside, to about 55C to 60C in three to four days. After four turnings, there is about 40 per cent weight loss as moisture content declines and also about 40 per cent volume reduction. After this, no leachate or methane or smelly gases are released, and this fully stabilised waste is called compost, rich in microbes as well as humus, both wonderful for soil vitality.This bio-stabilising of biodegradable waste makes a city fully compliant with the SWM Rules 2016. Screening makes it more farmer-friendly and helps move useful fractions offsite to ensure continued long-term use of the same site for waste processing. The recycling of existing waste management space is one of the biggest advantages of waste stabilising and frees local bodies from the constant search for new sites to pollute and new urban rural battles over locations for waste processing.Ahluwalia is chairperson, ICRIER, Delhi, and former chairperson of the high-powered expert committee on urban infrastructure and services.

But a section of farmers in the state are beginning to respond to farmer producer organizations (FPOs) attempt at marketing as an alternative to the traditional direct selling. The move is also expected to help farmers break the what-paddy cycle and take to growing vegetables.A study sponsored by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has found that the 69 FPOs in the state with 2,991 farmers as members have facilitated a shift towards crops without minimum support price (MSP). Twenty-nine more FPOs will be added in the ongoing financial year.The report makes out a case for integration of FPOs into the agriculture policy of the state by providing them agricultural produce marketing committee (APMC) licenses.In the case of wheat, out of 74 sampled farmers, 73 continued to sell their produce directly even after FPOs were formed. However, out of 21 pea farmers, 11 switched to FPOs. For other vegetables (except tomato, potato and peas) too, half of the 20 sampled farmers shifted to FPOs.Not just that, eight other farmers who were growing other crops too shifted to growing vegetables on a part of their land and sold it through FPOs.

While warming of a status quo till end of January, officials of the Telangana states agricultural marketing department attribute the abnormal price rise to the excessive rains in onion-growing states such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and West Bengal.They predict a price correction by February.Late rainfall in September and October damaged the onion kharif crop in Telangana also. Due to this, the supplies are now coming in only from Maharashtra, said Padma Harsha , deputy director of department.Predictably, J Ananthaiah, selection grade secretary, agricultural market committee at Malakpet , said that the daily procurements have dropped from nearly 40,000 bags per day to 10,000-15,000 onions bags per day, thus pushing the rates northwards.The steep jump in costs has adversely impacted traders in other markets whove stopped selling onions. We cannot purchase onions at such a rise price. Hence, we are clearing our old stock. If the situation continues, we may be forced to keep our shops shut, said Mohammed Abid , a vegetable vendor at the Erragadda Rhythu Bazaar.Not just onions, prices of other vegetables such as tomato, cabbage, carrot too have registered a more than 200 per cent rise in price rise as compared to the last winter season. While one kg of tomato cost 8 in December 2016, the price has now shot to 26 per kg. The price of carrot has increased from 16 to 50 per kg.Onions and tomato are basic vegetables. With the price rise, we are now forced to purchase these vegetables in lesser quantities, said Vijayalaxmi, a housewife from Kokapet. The steep rise in cost of vegetables has driven inflation to an eight-month high of 3.93 per cent."

Weather will remain dry the rest of the time.Moderate to dense fog is likely to occur at isolated places on December 13 and 14. Weather is likely to remain dry for the next two days. Maximum and minimum temperature is expected to hover between 16 and 21 degrees celsius and 5 to 12 degree celsius respectively. Maximum relative humidity is expected to remain between 78% and 90 % and minimum between 42% and 68 % during these days. Farmers sowing the gram crop are advised to use 36 kg seed per acre. They should treat the seed in termite-infested soil with Dursban 20 EC (chlorpyriphos) @ 10 ml per kg seed. Under December sowing, transplanting of gobhi sarson is more profitable than direct sowing, say experts. Farmers have also been advised to use 60-day old seedlings of gobhi sarson (GSL-1), 35-40 day old seedlings for gobhi sarson hybrid Hyola PAC 401 and 30-35 day old seedlings for GSC 6.As clear weather is expected during the next 3-4 days, wheat crop cv. PBW 658 and PBW 590 should be sown. Farmers are advised to spray weedicides.

Farmers have been warned against treating seed a month before sowing as it hampers germination.They should manage rodent pests in wheat crop sown with Happy Seeder by burrow baiting with 2% zinc phosphide twice at an interval of 10 to 15 days after sowing of crop (a week before or after irrigation) during this period. Farmers are also advised to spray magnesium sulphate in deficit soils where the wheat crop is 24 to 25 days old.They are advised to conduct regular surveillance of their fields for late blight of potato and if symptoms appear, spray the crop with Indofil M-45/Markzeb/Kavach @ 500-700 g in 250-350 litres of water per acre. For judicious use of pesticides, follow DSS for management of late blight of potato. If there is curling of leaves, farmers should uproot plants or damage infected plants. To control rust in pea, spray 500 g of Indofil M-45 in 200 litres of water.

5b5088d89855b708a7ccca2f,Veggie buyers feel price pinch,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/veggie-buyers-feel-price-pinch/articleshow/62060198.cms,2017-12-14,,The Times Of India,"BHOPAL: A steep hike in vegetables prices is leaving an unsettling effect on consumers home budget this winter. At this time of the season, a fresh and affordable stock of vegetables brings down the prices. But it does not look so for consumers this season. From traders to experts, nobody seems to have a definite answer for the spike. Some traders said monsoons played the spoilsport, some others heaped the blame on demonetisation and GST.With the onset of winter, when prices of vegetables are lower, consumers are shelling out as high as Rs 50 per kg for many vegetables. Take for example onions till the time of filing this report, the price of onion in the local markets for Rs 50-Rs 60 per kg, this when price hike has eased considerably. I purchased onions a few days ago for Rs 80, said Rajesh Kumar Saxena, a government official.Tomatoes were available at Rs 8-10 per kg last year. Till Tuesday evening, it was at steep Rs 60 per kg. On Wednesday, tomato prices somewhat cooled. Vendors say it will take at least a week to 10 days for prices to come down.WHAT THE VENDORS SAYDemonetisation effect could be the reason for this hike in tomato prices, say some vendors.Good quality tomatoes take 50-100 days to grow depending on the variety. Usually people begin sowing in May-June after the summer harvest. By winters, tomato is ready. However, this year there is less quantity of tomato this season. Small farmers who sell their produce directly in the market have been removed from the process this years, said Shri Kant, a local vegetable vendor in Bagsewani vegetable market, adding that there was a disruption in the production cycle induced by demonetisation.According to Abdul Raqib , president of Aloo Pyaaz Wholesaler Association , ill-timed monsoons resulted in wastage of many crops this year. The monsoon was unpredictable this year. There were no rains for better part of the monsoon season, but there were flash rains in the end. This lead to a crop failure in many parts which is why, there is less supply this season and more demand leading to push in prices. Raqib, however, said hike in tomato prices is likely to ease in coming days and have already seen a drop since Wednesday. The retail prices of vegetables are around 35-50% higher than the wholesale rate, due to wastage of perishable goods in winter. For example: The wholesale price of onion is Rs 30 per kg, whereas in market Rs 60.Other perishables like potatoes, cauliflower, peas, green onion, green leafy vegetable, pumpkin, brinjals are also seeing a price fluctuations because of the same. Vendors, however, say prices of seasonal vegetables will stabilise in the next two to three days.WHAT THE RESIDENTS SAYThis has been troubling Bhopalis as they have to make do without an essential vegetable in their winter platter. Tomatoes and onions are used in almost every Indian dish. These are essential products which cannot be substituted for anything else. This hike in prices upset my daily grocery budget, said Natasha Matani , an engineer, working with a private company. This pattern, however, is not limited to Bhopal alone, but is a nationwide phenomenon. According to government data, inflation based on consumer food price index rose to 4.42% from 1.90% a month ago and 2.03% a year ago, whereas vegetable prices have increased to 22.48% in November from 7.47% last month.This despite the fact that Madhya Pradesh saw a bumper onion crop this season.Some residents feel the government is also to be blamed for this. Every day we read in news that onion has been rotting in the open. In a country where people are still struggling for daily meals, government should have not let so much food get waste, said Matani. There were others who said that the administration should intervene as the prices are burning a hole in the pocket of common people. Maladministration and crop wastage lead to such a situation. The government should intervene to ensure easy distribution of vegetables in markets so that we do face loss due to poor administration, said Reeta Prakasham , an educationist.WHAT THE EXPERTS SAYAfter initial slim pickings of food crops in few months post-demonetisation, many farmers were forced to terminate their summer crop due to which there is shortage of tomato supply in the market this season. Experts say during this time last year with demonetisation, the sapped currency supply lead to sudden decrease in prices. The farmers needed money and traders did not have it, which is why they had to sell their products cheap which eventually lead to less sowing in the next season. The effect of which is becoming apparent this winter.B L Sharma, an economist in the Madhya Pradesh Planning Commission, says as the winter intensifies, prices of perishables will drop. Prices are expected to come down in coming few days after the winter intensifies. Perishables are dependent on weather and also on the demand supply gap. When demand goes up, vendors stock supplies to take advantage of it, further pushing prices.State horticulture director Satyanand said, The rise and fall in prices is due to market forces, which balance themselves on their own. When there is a gap between harvest and sowing new crop, this problem comes up, which will get solved as soon as the new stock arrives.However, there are many, who blame demonetisation and GST for the same. Indias perishable market is a cash-based mandi dependent system. Even though cash has come back in overall circulation, it is yet to be efficiently circulated in the mandis. Over a year has gone by, but payments are still being done in cashless method, which is not convenient to small and medium farmers, said an expert seeking anonymity.The surge in prices is also due to delay in reaction to the supply and demand. Due to disturbed production of perishable goods this year, the market is not very flexible to demand and supply changes this year. For example, if demand increases for a vegetable, it will take time for market forces to adjust themselves to accommodate the rise in demand with the supply, since the mandis and wholesale markets are still not running efficiently as compared to previous years, the expert said, adding that another week might give the market enough time to adjust with the demand leading to a stable rate."

The video went viral on social media on Tuesday.Someone had told me that you cannot eat what Modi eats every day because it is not the poor peoples food. I asked him what kind of food does he (PM) eat? The person told me Modiji eats mushrooms. I told him what is the big deal in this, as mushrooms are available here also. He then told me that Modi does not eat what you people eat here. He gets imported mushrooms from Taiwan. The mushrooms which are imported from Taiwan cost around Rs 80,000 each. I was amazed. He went on saying Modi Saheb consumes five mushrooms a day, says Alpesh in the video.Alpesh further said in the video that to a query, he was told by the person that Modi has been eating mushrooms since he was CM (of Gujarat).Now, I know the reason why he became so fair as he was as dark as me earlier. I have also seen his 35-year-old photographs when he was as dark as me. Now he is glowing like a tomato and has also become healthy, Thakor said in the video. The OBC leader, however, was not available for his comments despite repeated attempts."

The retail price, however, has remained more unchanged.While green peas prices have spiraled to Rs 40-45/kg in wholesale market from Rs 25 on Wednesday, pushing the retail price to Rs 70-80/kg from the earlier Rs 50-60, the low supply of capsicum from Palghar due to the recent unseasonal rain has pushed up the wholesale rates to Rs 30-35 a kg from 25-30. Capsicum is currently retailed at Rs 60-70/kg from Rs 50-60 earlier.However, tomato prices have dropped to Rs 20 from Rs 25-30/kg in the wholesale market, bringing down the retail price too to Rs 40-50/kg from Rs 50-60 on Wednesday. It was sold at Rs 40-55 in Andheri.Onion prices rose in wholesale market despite the arrival of 125 trucks on Thursday, said potato-onion wholesale trader Ashok Walunj. APMC received just 30 trucks on Wednesday as against 110 trucks on Tuesday. However, the prices had remained unchanged with poor turnout of retailers. The rates are expected rise further and then stabilize in the next couple of weeks. While red onions were retailed at Rs 45-50/kg at Andheri-Versova, old onions were sold at Rs 55-60.Experts say the recent showers may have affected the quality of onions. Even a days non-seasonal rain can cause a lot of damage to the crop that is being harvested. The quantum is yet to be ascertained; a clear picture will emerge by next week, said Manohar Totlani, a trader. The harvest may get delayed by almost a week due to wet ground conditions, where farmers avoid collecting the crop.Early this week, wholesale onion prices had dropped to Rs 25-30/kg from Rs 30-35, attributing to arrival of fresh crop armed with the Centres cap on export by raising the minimum export price. But after the unseasonal showers on Monday and Tuesday, the prices have shot up yet again. Vegetable prices will remain uncertain till this weekend. The picture will be clear by Monday when the quantum of damage crop is expected to come to fore, said Balasaheb Badade, a trader.Mumbaikars are worried about the rising prices. Kandivli resident Abhijeet Thakur said, There has been no relief from expensive vegetables for the last few months. We have reduced the quantity to adjust the kitchen budget. The prices of other vegetables have remained mostly unchanged despite only 450 truckloads arriving in the APMC compared to the usual supply of 500-600 trucks. After a spell of inflation, vegetable prices were normalizing, but rain played spoilsport. A small bundle of coriander costs Rs 20 against the earlier Rs 10, said Mahim resident Rekha Sharma."
