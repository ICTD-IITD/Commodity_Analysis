Manimegalai, a home maker from Puliyakulam whose family budget is dependent only on her husbands income, increase in the price of some of the vegetables has led to changes in the daily expenditure.The weekly Uzhavar Santhai used to be a boon for mid and low income families. Now, farmers who sell vegetables directly have also increased prices citing changes in retail market. Hike in the price of coconut has forced us to replace thengai chutney with sambar or thakkali chutney . Luckily, price of tomato has not increased as much as it shot up in July, said Ms. Manimegalai. Quoting some of her neighbours, she said families are buying vegetables in bulk and storing them in refrigerator when prices are low.A vendor from a neighbourhood grocery store near Sivaram Nagar said that sale of vegetables has come down as as she was, with no option left, already selling them at a few paise/rupee higher than the price of vegetables at bigger retail stores.For vegetable buyers in the city, prices of small onions, coconuts, and tomatoes have shot up during the last few days, making many reluctant to buy these. Even in the weekly markets, the prices are high. I have stopped buying small onions, says Jothimani, a resident of Ramanathapuram.Prices of small onions is expected to hover around Rs. 120-140 for another two to three months and prices of tomatoes will come down in a fortnight, said M.R. Palanisamy, Deputy Director of Agriculture Marketing here.According to M. Rajendran, president of Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants Association, small onion prices might touch Rs. 200 a kg in the retail market. This is mainly because of drought last year and recent heavy unseasonal rains in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Farmers are not benefiting from the price rise.The wholesale price of small onions is about Rs. 140. If we used to get 2,000 bags of small onions in the market a day, it has dwindled to 200 bags now. Coconut prices are up because trees dried in Pollachi area and many have cut down the trees because of drought earlier this year. It will take another three months for arrivals to pick up.Prices of most of the vegetables are above Rs. 50 a kg. It will take one or two months for the prices to stabilise. Farmers who cultivated small onions on about 950 hectares in Thondamuthur area saw a bumper crop this season. They did not get a good price last month.Traders and farmers who had stored small onions were getting good prices now, said trade and official sources.The prices were between Rs. 60 and Rs. 100 last week and increased to Rs. 115 to Rs. 120 now in the wholesale market.The retail price at Uzhavar Santhai on Wednesday was between Rs. 130 and Rs. 135. Bulk buying by the traders for exporting to Middle-East countries might also be a reason for the price rise, said Mr. Palanisamy.However, the prices of country tomato which was just about Rs. 30-a-kg last week has increased to Rs. 35- 38 per kg in Uzhavar Santhais on Wednesday. The prices of tomato is expected to come down in a fortnight, when farmers in Madukkarai block will begin harvest. Tomato was cultivated in 370 hectares in Madukkarai block and 80 hectare in other blocks in Coimbatore district, he said.Farmers Association (Tamilaga Vivasayeegal Sangam) secretary P. Kandasamy said farmers decided when to sell produce based on their needs than on market price.Most often the market intelligence reports were of little help to them as they did not, so far, factor in movement of produce from other States to the city.Having seen prices crash in local markets due to arrival of vegetables from other States, the local farmers had begun taking their needs into account to sell produce.The Government should ensure farmers get a stable price throughout the season, Mr. Rajendran said.(with inputs from R. Arivanantham, Karthik Madhavan, Wilson Thomas, and M. Soundariya Preetha)"

The hybrid variety of tomato is being sold at Rs. 55 a kg.m.a. sriramWith the prices of onion and tomato, two essential vegetables, going north, families are being forced to replan their monthly domestic budgets and purchase in moderation.The prices are unlikely to come down until fresh stocks, especially of onions, hit the markets. The prices began rising over a month ago and old onions (the red variety usually procured from onion-growing belts in Maharashtra) cost even more now.In the retail market of Mysuru, onions cost between Rs. 50 and Rs. 60 a kg. Larger onions cost even more and the premium quality fetches Rs. 5 more per kg. Meanwhile, the hybrid variety of tomato is being sold at Rs. 55 a kg while the local variety is fetching between Rs. 40 and Rs. 45.At the Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS) outlets here, onions are being sold at Rs. 55 a kg and tomatoes at Rs. 40 a kg.HOPCOMS managing director Anand told The Hindu that onion prices in the wholesale market of the APMC here have gone up, forcing retailers to revise their selling price. The purchase price of onion is Rs. 40 a kg, plus 5% tax. Despite the spiralling prices, we are selling onions at our outlets with a wafer-thing profit margin. Even the price of tomatoes has remained on the higher side, with the selling price hovering around Rs. 40 a kg, he said.Datta, manager at a HOPCOMS procurement centre, said there has been a drop in supply of onions from the major onion markets in north Karnataka and Maharashtra. This is following a fall in production owing to untimely rains.We have no agreement with the farmers on onion procurement. Therefore, we procure them directly from the wholesale dealers at the APMC [yard]. We pay them according to the days market rate with tax, he said.A cashier at a grocery shop in I Block of Ramakrishna Nagar said customers keep asking why the prices have skyrocketed and why they have not stabilised even after so many days."

Bhajibhakare, District Collector, witnessing the production of value added products from tomato at the mobile processing unit of the Indian Institute of Crop Processing Technology, at Karumanthurai near Salem on Tuesday.A demonstration on the production of value-added products from tomato using the mobile processing unit of the Indian Institute of Crop Processing Technology (IICPT) at Karumanthurai near here on Tuesday evoked good response from the farming community.Rohini R. Bhajibhakare, District Collector, who inaugurated the demo, said that the State Government has accorded priority in implementing various projects benefiting the farming community.The Government wanted the farmers to adopt latest technologies for augmenting their revenue.The Collector said that the farmers suffer heavy financial loss, when their produce does not fetch adequate price in the markets. The farmers could utilise the mobile processing units for processing their produce and converting them into value-added products, which could be marketed at a better price where there was demand.The farmers can procure the equipment worth Rs. 40 lakh by joining together or through the cooperative societies functioning in their villages.Ms. Rohini said that the farmers raised the issue of 18 per cent GST for the drip irrigation equipment provided by the government under subsidy scheme. They wanted the State government to request the Centre to withdraw the GST.The discussion taken place in this regard at the farmers grievances redress day meeting was taken to the notice of the State Agriculture Secretary. The Chief Minister after considering the Salem farmers plea has taken a decision that the GST on the drip irrigation equipment would be paid by the State Government itself.Arul Jothi Arasan, Project Director, District Rural Development Agency, K.

This is precisely what the worldwide tour Bhairav Se Bhairavi Tak being undertaken by renowned vocalists, Pandit Rajan and Sajan Mishra, which commenced from Varanasi recently, signifies. We were seized of the ongoing violence and terrorism world over, which only harms humanity without serving any purpose. Wondering what to do, we decided to propagate peace and brotherhood through our music, explains Rajan Mishra as we settle down for a quiet lunch at Shangri-Las Eros Hotels Tamra restaurant. Agreeing Sajan Mishra, adds, music has tremendous power to move human hearts.We ask for green tea to be followed by som tam, the Thai papaya salad. The staff suggests tomato and bocconcini sandwich to which they readily agree. As in music where we keep exploring ragas, we also experiment with food too, quips Sajan Mishra.Power of musicOne wonders as to how music can help? The entire planet and nature is enveloped in music. Our voice is sound or swara and the heart and pulse beats are layas. Nobody is beyond music as it strikes a chord with all living beings instantly. In fact, the whole cosmic energy moves in rhythm. We have formed rapport through music with even those who do not know our language. In Paris, the audience approached us for autographs with tears rolling down their eyes. Such is the power of melody, relates Rajan Mishra.Sajan Mishra cites the example of their concert at Maastricht, Holland, where audience did not clap. Wondering what went wrong, we were later informed by them that they did not want to disturb the harmony created by the music. That is one of the best compliments we have been paid ever.Has singing given them tranquillity? Besides name and fame, it has given a spiritual dimension to our life making us at peace. Be it riyaaz or concert, we remember Goddess Saraswati and our forefathers and seek their blessings and start. Closing our eyes we are lost and sing to our satisfaction ensuring the audience follows and they do. Recently at Delhi Universitys Shivaji College, we sang for three hours without any student leaving the hall.Driving home the point, Sajan Mishra recalls that once they rushed from a Ganesh Utsav recital at Pune to Mumbai to catch a flight to Malaga in Spain for another show. We did not sleep a wink. Reaching the venue, we splashed water and changed into fresh clothes. We were bone tired yet on the stage with tanpura and tabla as accompaniments, we felt no fatigue and gave a memorable performance.So will this whirlwind tour involve long concerts encompassing all ragas from Bhairav to Bhairavi. Sajan Mishra expounds: We are talking about the whole spectrum and bouquet of ragas and not necessarily from early morning to evening. In lots of places, there are issues concerning audience, auditorium, timings, or security and so keeping those in mind we have worked out various permutations and combinations to bring fore the flavour of ragas. In Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Delhi and Bengaluru, we are doing two concerts, morning and evening just as in Houston. In London we will start at 1 p.m. Adding Rajan Mishra says, Bhairav is an important raga which is sung at dawn just when sun rays start dissipating darkness, has mircotones of Rishabh and Dhaiwat being used. There are several types of Bhairav like Lalit, Ahir, Bairagi and Nat. Bhairavi, a ragini of Bhairav, uses many surs and shudh surs and brings down curtain on a performance. His short demo of the two have heads turning around in awe and admiration.With sandwich and salad being laid, we take a break. Tasting them, the two approve much to the delight of the staff. Bahut achha hai, remarks Rajan Mishra, who loves food and is eager to taste all things new. I like almost all regional cuisines, be it Gujarati, Rajasthani, Uttar Pradesh, Punjabi or South Indian. My favourites include dal-chawal, khichdi, khandvi, undhiyu, rohu fish, bhaat-jhol, dosa, idli, paniharam and appam. Food like music is a labour of love and brings happiness, satisfaction and peace to one making as well as eating. Sajan Mishra, prefers food from UP, Rajasthan and Punjab. They are rich in taste. These regions offer great variety like dal bati choorma, kachhi methi ki and sangria ki subzis, different parathas and dahi.When asked if he cooks, Rajan Mishra replies promptly: Mujhe toh nimbu bhi katna nahi ata. He quietly lets it slip in that Sajan Mishra is a fabulous cook reputed for his dal and chicken preparations. I never had formal training and dont depend on recipes. Having observed my mother and chachi, I started out when we had to fend on our own in Delhi many years ago. Recalling what I had observed, my first attempt yielded delicious dal and gobhi subzi. The bhindi I did not realise had to be washed before being cut. It didnt get cooked despite several helpings of ghee and oil. Our friend sarod player, Ashok Roy and his wife, dropped in. They enjoyed dal and gobhi and quietly ate the bhindi without any comment, quips Sajan Mishra.Such is his love for food that at Vlodrop, Holland, during a tour organised by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, on finding the food placid, Sajan Mishra, decided to use some tadka in the dal and vegetables. I purchased ginger, garlic, chillies and other condiments and decided to use the electric kettle. About to start, Maharishis nephew Girish dropped in unexpectedly. Getting the fragrance, he remarked, Can we also have some of this, and I said join the party. Once, Ritesh, my nephew, requested for kadhi, which I had never made before. With everything ready, I used the curd in the fridge and later the whole place was filled with a strong aroma of strawberry. Investigating I found myself staring at the red kadhi as I had used strawberry curd. Quietly, I dumped it far away. No wonder, they say, raag rasoi pagdi kabhi kabhi bandh jaye (music, food and pagdi sometimes turns to be excellent), he chuckles loudly.On a serious note, Rajan Mishra, is appalled with the burden of studies on children these days. In our time, we studied, played, indulged in pranks and also bunked to watch movies. They couldnt be serious. We had been caught and punished too. Our gurus, grandfather, Bade Ram Das Ji Mishra, father, Hanuman Prasad Mishra and uncle, Gopal Prasad Mishra insisted that sports is required to keep fit and healthy. They insisted on complete concentration, singing with heart and soul instead of treating it as a drill. That helped us to do well in studies too. While Rajan Mishra has a masters degree in sociology, Sajan Mishra graduated from Banaras Hindu University.With great masters at constant attendance, it must have been advantageous. Yes, we were helped by nature and nurture but they never favoured us. The taalim was without fear or favour. They instructed us to listen to other great masters and imbibe their qualities. So we learnt the grasp on sur from Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, while Ustad Vilayat Khan, sitar maestro taught us that the tempo of laya and taan should always synchronise, replies Rajan Mishra.New generation singersTalking about the new generation of singers, Rajan Mishra says, They are extraordinarily talented. All they need is stay away from diversions like mobile, television, internet and computer. Forgetting about updating Facebook, they need to concentrate on studies and music. Rajan Mishra loves to teach while Sajan Mishra fills in his absence. Main unko workout karata hoon, bhai sahib daud lagwate hain (I give workout while brother makes them run), he jests making Rajan Mishra smile.With the brothers declining desserts, one wonders if is a precautionary measure? No, we love khoye ki mithai, sandesh, Banarasi jalebi and sohan halwa, replies Rajan Mishra, and as for precaution, you will be surprised we eat everything. Finding me surprised, he says, Eating is closely related to psychology. The moment you think gol gappa pani will affect the throat, it will. We eat everything bindaas  chutni, aachar, papad, chaat, bhel puri, dahi bhalla, pav bhaji, sev puri, ice creams and drink chilled water. It has never affected our voice. Sajan Mishra adds, Riyaaz cleans up everything. Did you know Begum Akhtar used to eat paan and drink ice water but her voice remained golden.Nobody is beyond music as it strikes a chord with all living beings instantly. In fact, the whole cosmic energy moves in rhythmRajan Mishra"

Traders said tomatoes cost Rs. 40 per kg due to shortage in supply, while onions were at Rs. 35 per kg. Rising prices of both vegetables over the past four weeks has inconvenienced both consumers and sellers alike, traders said.Officials at the APMC said both crops were hit by unseasonal rain, pushing the wholesale prices of tomato to between Rs. 30 and Rs. 40 per kg, and to between Rs. 50 and Rs. 60 in retail outlets. Onion prices, too, went up, selling in retail for Rs. 50 to Rs. 60, depending on quality and location. With the onion crop severely hit in Karnataka, the neighbouring State is depending almost completely on supply from Nashik. Of the 300 trucks of onions entering Bengaluru APMC, over 250 are from Nashik.Ashok Walunj, former director, onion and potato division, APMC, said supply has improved since Wednesday. Around 245 trucks of onion arrived on Thursday and Friday, pushing prices down. Were expecting a fresh stock of onions on Monday. This will bring down the rates further. Within a weeks time, rates will regularise to Rs. 15 to Rs. 20.Tomato, which usually costs between Rs. 18 to Rs. 25 per kg, was being sold at Rs. 45 per kg at the APMC on Friday. Shankar Pingle, former director, vegetables division, APMC, said. Usually, the tomato season starts by mid-October, bring prices down. This time, the tomato crop has been affected by rains in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh in September. During the same time last year, tomatoes cost Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 per kg.Anil Rai, who is among the top tomato dealers in the market, said, On an average, 100 trucks would come to the APMC, each bearing 10 tonnes of tomatoes. This would be distributed across Mumbai Metropolitan Region. However, no supply at all from Karnataka has affected us the most. Whatever is coming to the market is from nearby districts including Nashik, Pune and Satara, but it isnt enough. As per APMC records, the vegetables division received around 40 vehicles of tomatoes on Friday.Mr. Rai added that as the tomato crop cycle is of 90 days, farmers have sown again and this produce is expected in the next 15 to 20 days. This will bring down rates further."

Its impact will continue to hurt people for some days yet. As residents rushed to stock up on vegetables after the rain largely kept off during the day, they realised that not much was available in the local markets or Chala.Whatever little was available was a few days old. If at all new stock was available, it was of poor quality.A retail vegetable seller in Karamana said prices of some vegetables had risen steeply. Carrots, for instance, cost Rs. 110 to Rs. 130 a kg, depending on quality. Some vegetables are not available. There are no curry leaves to be had. Lemons too are difficult to come by, the vendor said. Picking up the thundan chilli variety, he said those were starting to rot though they had just been bought. These cost Rs. 140. A few days ago, large thundan chillies cost Rs. 120.A wholesale dealer in Chala market said they had last received fresh stock two days ago, but had run out of those. To meet their commitments, including that to supermarkets, they are forced to buy vegetables from within the Chala market. We have placed orders, but our suppliers in Tamil Nadu say they are not getting enough vegetables. We are selling tomatoes at Rs. 60, but there is almost no stock left. Drumstick, he said, cost Rs. 200 a kg.A wholesale plantain dealer said he sold the nendran variety at Rs. 32, but prices would go down further owing to large-scale damage to plantain crop in Parassala, Kaliyikkavila and growing areas in Tamil Nadu.A retail vendor said prices, which had just started to stabilise, would rise in the aftermath of Ockhi. Some vegetables are not available. Others such as tomato, the price of which had just dipped to Rs. 55 a kg, will now shoot up. On Sunday, tomato cost Rs. 80 a kg.Horticorp chairman Vinayan said supply from other States had not been affected, but Ockhi had inflicted damage in areas where crops such as carrot, cabbage, and cauliflower were grown in the State. There is harvested stock for now, but whatever had been sown has been lost, and the real impact will be felt in a couple of months."

More significantly, the economy clocked a growth of 6.3% in the second quarter of this year, after slowing for at least four quarters. But official data for the third quarter (October to December) so far suggest that the economy is still not entirely out of the woods and fresh headwinds, such as rising oil prices, could upset the fragile recovery. Manufacturing growth, driven by restocking by producers after the rollout of the goods and services tax, was a major factor in the second quarter growth pick-up. After two months of robust 4%-plus growth, industrial activity however slipped in October, with the Index of Industrial Production reflecting just 2.2% growth. October was a festive month but consumer durables production contracted by nearly 7%, mining was virtually stagnant, and manufacturing growth moderated to 2.5% from 3.8% last year. This coincides with exporters seeing a 1.1% slump in shipments in October, after growing at an average of over 13% in the second quarter. It is also borne out by the nearly 10% drop in GST collections that month compared to September. The IIP has now grown just 2.5% in the first seven months of 2017-18, compared to 5.5% in the same period last fiscal.If the spectre of slower growth with weak exports at a time when global trade is recovering is not worrying enough, with job creation still to pick up, the latest inflation data set too is cause for concern. Prices at the consumer level rose at the fastest pace in 15 months this November, with inflation touching 4.88%, up from 3.6% in October and just 1.5% in June. This reflects a broad-based price rise under way, although it is led by fuel inflation (at 7.2%, from 6.1% a month ago) and food inflation (4.4%, from 1.9% in October). Within food, rising onion and tomato prices pushed vegetable inflation to a 16-month high of 22.5%; inflation in egg prices quickened from 0.8% in October to 8% in November. While some of this food inflation could wane in the coming months, there is greater concern about the rise in core inflation (excluding food and fuel) and inflation imported through high global prices. On Tuesday, oil prices breached the $65 a barrel mark for the first time in over two years. The government faces difficult choices. Slashing fuel taxes could calm inflation, but it would hit revenue collections that are already uncertain owing to GST deadline extensions. Not doing so would leave less room for the central bank to lower interest rates. As the Economic Survey said, oil at $60-65 could hit consumption and public investment and dent private investment further. That is not a path to a sustained revival."

Tomatoes have been withdrawn from McDonalds items because, according to the company, there have been quality issues with the produce.In Maharashtra, most of the the winter crop of tomato comes from Niphad and its adjoining talukas in Nashik district, while the Junnar tehsil in Pune provides the summer crop. Multi-national chains usually follow a farm-to-fork model, under which growers directly supply the produce to their stores.Selected stores of McDonalds follow the same model in Maharashtra. Confirming that McDonalds outlets in the state have stopped serving tomatoes since last week, a spokesperson of the fast food chain said, We have observed certain quality issues in tomatoes and the current supplies are not meeting McDonalds stringent quality standards. So, we have decided against using the ingredient in certain cities.The spokesperson added that the chain was monitoring supplies on a daily basis and would start serving tomatoes as soon as the produce met their quality standards. On the other hand, growers lamented that heavy rain in Nashik during the fag end of monsoon season had affected the produce. Santosh Gorade, a farmer from Takli village in Niphad taluka, said heavy rain had washed away almost 80-90 per cent of the crop. The crop was almost market-ready, but the rain destroyed it. The next pick was spotted, and the produce was of inferior quality, he said.(Above) A notice in a McDonalds outlet about tomatoes not being used in food products (Above) A notice in a McDonalds outlet about tomatoes not being used in food productsAt the wholesale market of Pimpalgaon Baswant, the arrival of tomatoes has dropped by about 25-30 per cent.
