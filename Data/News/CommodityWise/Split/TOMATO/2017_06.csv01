But these days she is faced with a tough choice, whether to add onions to the food items or not. That's because the price of onions is steadily climbing the charts and has reached Rs 50/kg in the retail market, up by Rs 10 from last week. And if market insiders are to be believed, the cost could go up further.The spike in onion prices, along with the rise in the cost of vegetables are burning a hole in the pocket of the common people. Even the state government's assurance to deal with the price rise by importing onions from neighbouring states have failed to yield results.""Usually I require around 2-3 kg of onions every week to cook food for my family of five. After the price rise I am trying to manage with 1kg. I am finding it very difficult to cook non-veg food,"" said Pati, a housewife.""For the past two months onions are being sold at Rs 40 per kg and above. Last week it suddenly increased to Rs 46 and today it has gone up to Rs 50 per kg. How can a family manage with such stiff hike of essential commodities?"" asked Manisha Behera, another homemaker.On october 28, food supplies and consumer welfare minister Surya Narayan Patro had said that the prices would come down within one week after the new harvest.""The new harvest will arrive in the next one week after which the situation is likely to improve. I have also requested the Maharashtra government to supply onions to us first as our consumers are facing inconvenience,"" Patro had said.On Thursday, when asked about the prevailing situation, Patro said: ""Now procurement of all agriculture products will be made through e-procurement. So once fresh procurement orders are placed the prices are likely to drop.""Traders said the main reason behind the hike in onion prices was the loss of crop due to bad weather and the cost being high in the source states. ""On Thursday wholesale price at Nasik mandi was Rs 4,200 to Rs 4,500 per quintal. After adding transportation cost, the price in Odisha will be more than Rs 5,000 per quintal,"" said Sameer Das , a wholesale trader at Unit-I market.The prices of vegetables too are moving up. Tomato has been selling at Rs 60 per kg, broad beans at Rs 80/kg, okra for Rs 60/kg, drumsticks at Rs 200/kg and green peas for Rs 100/kg. These apart most vegetable prices are hovering around the Rs 50/kg mark."

The model legislation will ensure that a reasonable amount is guaranteed to the farmers, he said.Contract farming is done by agro processing, exporting, trading, and value addition companies to procure certain amount of produce from the fields.Now, we are seeking the opinion of the stakeholders, after which the draft Act would be enacted. The States need to adopt similar legislations, he pointed out.New technologiesThe legislation would also help infuse new technologies into farming so as to reduce pre and post-harvest losses.This will help whenever there is surplus production with timely storage, mainly for perishable commodities, for a short time and their transportation to places where good price is guaranteed, he said, and pointed out how onion farmers of Nasik in Maharashtra and tomato growers of Madanapalle in Andhra Pradesh were being forced to resort to distress sale whenever there was a glut situation in the market.He said NITI Aayog, the think tank of the government, had undertaken studies on how to optimise price realisation for the farmers, and praised Madhya Pradesh for its success in the implementation of price stabilisation for the farmers with timely market intervention.Value additionReferring to the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, he said the focus of the programme was to inculcate innovative spirit among the farmers, the backbone of the country, and encourage them for value addition and take up entrepreneurship by forming into a network of small farmers for collective marketing.Immense potentialAsked to comment on the future of startups in giving a boost to the rural economy, he said under the Atal Innovation Mission, a comprehensive ecosystem was being created to convince educated youth from all parts of the country to explore immense potential of warehousing, transportation, cold storage, call centres, weather forecast, and timely supply of quality seed, pesticides, and fertilizers.We are seeking the opinion of stakeholders, after which the draft Act will be enacted.

While the showers are responsible for pulling down prices of a handful of vegetables , it has adversely affected the stocks of others, thereby burning a hole in consumers' pockets.Over the last few days, prices of cabbage and cauliflower have dropped sharply, thanks the low-pressure triggered rain. Wholesalers have resorted to distress sale to clear the cabbage-cauliflower stock damaged by the rain.But buyers are not so lucky when it comes to other vegetables. Prices of some staple vegetables have remained consistently at or above Rs 50/kg. This is bit unusual if you look at previous years. By this time last year, vegetable prices nosedived sharply.According to sources, rain has delayed harvesting of winter vegetables in Bengal, forcing the state to depend on other states. Consumers, subsequently, are bearing the price burden. ""Most of the winter vegetables we are now getting is coming from outside. Peyajkoli (Scallion), which is coming from Karimpur in Bangladesh , remains pricey. Tomato from Purulia has just started arriving. So, tomato price is likely to crash in two-three days,"" said Kamal Dey, Koley Market vendors association president and Bengal government's market task force member.But the showers have spelt doom for potato. After last year's bumper crop, this year was predicted to be a lean year. But the untimely rain can make it far worse. ""So, potato prices might shoot up unusually,"" said Dey.But what is most striking is the gap between wholesale and retail prices. ""Around 20% is the reasonable gap between wholesale and retail prices, if you take into account transportation cost, waste and local market levy by trading associations. But in case of most of the vegetables, the difference is between 60% and 80%,"" said Anubrata Chatterjee, an agro-retail economist.The government should put up a board at every municipal market to publicize wholesale prices so that a consumer knows whether the retail vendor is asking for too much, advised Dey. An aware consumer can always bring down the price of vegetables at a reasonable level.Last week's rain has hit the prime vegetable producing districts like South 24 Parganas, East, Bankura, Hooghly and Howrah hard. In South 24 Parganas, 8,242 hectares have been affected, followed by East Midnapore (6,984 hectares), Bankura (4,380 hectares) and Hooghly (1,544 hectares),"" said an agriculture department officer."

CM Manohar Lal Khattar unveiled the scheme  which will be initially extended to famers growing potato, onion, tomato and cauliflower  in Karnal.Haryana director general of horticulture Arjun Saini said the schemes aim was to help farmers in distress and ensure they recover input costs. For example, if a farmer has spent Rs 400 on producing 100kg potato, he is free to sell it at any price to reap profits. However, if he fails to recover his input cost due to drop in rates, the department will compensate for the difference, he added.Saini said the cost of horticulture produce would be determined by experts from the Haryana Agriculture University, department of horticulture and Kisan Ayog. It is different from minimum support price (MSP). With this, distressed farmers growing vegetables in Haryana will no more have to throw their produce on roads in the event of a crash in prices. The idea is to encourage them to resort to diversification of crops, he said.The department clarified that farmers would be compensated only if they registered themselves on the portal and the produce was sold through the market committees using J-forms. A separate fund would be constituted by the state government for the scheme.Speaking at the inauguration of scheme, Khattar said compensation at the rate of Rs 400 per quintal would be given for tomato and potato, and the amount would be Rs 500 per quintal for onion and cauliflower.Terming the scheme as a big sham and a huge fraud on the farmers of the state, Haryana Congress legislature party leader Kiran Choudhry said the state government should fix MSP for vegetables and procure those if it was keen to help them.She added that the scheme seeking to offer input cost for four crops  potato, onion, cabbage and tomatofrom January onwards, consciously puts the cost of growing way below the cost price so that the government was not made to pay anything."

I can buy fresh tomatoes daily as they cost less, she said.Shalini Khera from RT Nagar was happy that the prices were low but said the quality was bad too. The quality has also been affected. We get raw or rotten tomatoes mixed with good quality ones, she pointed out.Till August, tomatoes prices kept rising and hit Rs 100 a kg. Until two weeks ago, they were sold for Rs 40-50 a kg.Rates at Hopcoms (Horticulture Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society) stores were at Rs 10 a kg on Sunday.The reason behind the drop in prices is good rain that the state received this year. This led to a larger crop, said wholesalers. The supply has increased from tomato-growing districts like Chikkballapur, Kolar and Mandya. We cant store the crop as it is a perishable commodity. We expect the prices to remain the same for the next two weeks, said R V Gopi, president, City Market Vegetable Merchants Association.Tomato is grown on about 59,000 hectares across state. Kolar district grows tomato on 17,000 hectares of land.Mohammad Manjur Ahmad, a vegetable vendor from Munireddypalya, said, The increased yield leads to wastage of stock. We cant store them and we are not able to sell all of it in a day. We buy it at Rs 15 a kg from wholesalers but are forced to retail at Rs 10 a kg.Another vegetable vendor from Shivajinagar, Imran Khan said, Though tomatoes sell more than any other fruit or vegetable, the high supply has pushed the prices down. Retailers like me are losing out."

Madurai Central Market Association secretary G Thiagarajan said that the tomato supply was high this year due to the good rainfall during the cultivation season. If there is no rain this winter during the harvest season, not just tomatoes but even onions, which have been hovering at more than Rs 100 per kilogram for the last six months, will come down to about Rs 20 or less, he said.President of the Central Market Association, R S P Sekhar said that the supplies had dropped to about 4,000 boxes of 15 kilograms each in November this year, but suddenly there was a surge and on Friday, when 7,000 to 8,000 boxes of tomatoes arrived at the market.A box of 15 kilograms was sold at Rs 70 on Friday and is expected to go down further, he said. The wholesale price for the tomato is Rs 5 to 6 based on the quality of the fruit. Traders say that a cold storage facility would help them to conserve the fruits at least for a day or two when there is excess supply, failing which they have to throw away the damaged or crushed fruit, which will start rotting immediately.While the market had depended on supplies of tomatoes and onions from the other states about a month ago to meet the demand, now local supply has become plentiful. K Palaniyandi a farmer from Dindigul said that there was a good harvest this time, but it would not fetch them a good profit, as they had to sell the picked fruits and traders named their price.Meanwhile, retailers are selling tomatoes at Rs10 a kilogram, in many parts of the city. We need a margin of atleast Rs 4 otherwise we do not make any profit, said Sankarapandian of Anna Nagar."

Besides dip in production of major fruits like mango, guava, litchi and banana, productivity of major crops like wheat, rice and pulse also witnessed downtrend in 2015-16 as compared to 2013-14.Although production of potato witnessed marginal improvement (63.45 lakh tonne in 2015-16 against 60.50 lakh tonne in 2013-14), onion and tomato went down to 12.47 lakh tonne from 13.04 lakh tonne and 10.01 lakh tonne from 10.61 lakh ton in the same corresponding year.Net sown area for sugarcane also came down to 3.46% of net cultivable area in 2015-16 as against 3.66% recorded in 2013-14.

Students are given lectures thrice a week on how to maintain the garden by urban farming groups like Start Upcycling Now (SUN) and iKheti, which helped the school to set up the garden.The project started in July 2016 after Father Gregory, the schools manager, roped in 240 students of Class 8 and explained the idea. Fascinated by the idea of having their own garden, the students immediately swung into action. Each class is divided into four sections and each division was assigned four gardens each.In a concrete jungle like Mumbai, a terrace garden awakens a sense of environmental consciousness and becomes a forum for knowledge. It also provides a variety of organic and fresh vegetables right at your doorstep, said Father Gregory.He added that a special period has been dedicated for the students to do the gardening work, which includes watering the plants, planting new vegetables, adding soil and compost or removing saplings, everything is done in the Work Experience period once a week.To execute the project, students created soil beds using clay bricks. A plastic sheet was spread on the brick base to prevent water from seeping through. Later, seven inch thick soil layer is spread on the plastic and is mixed with mulch comprising shredded cardboard and dry leaves. This helps soil to retain moisture even on the hot days.We should not just teach students phrases, but also make them apply those in real life. This is their real education. Now, they are so involved in it that they even utilise their recess time nurturing the plants, said Gracy Solomon, principal, OLPS.StudentspeakCommenting on the initiative, Razeen Sayyed, 13, said, We (each division) get 30 minutes with our respective gardens during which we must ensure that everything is fine with the crop. If everything is okay, and we are left with some time, we make self-irrigation bottles.The terrace garden produces brinjals, tomatoes, ladies fingers (okra), lemon grass, lemons and carom seeds (ajwain), which is appreciated not only by their treachers but also the monkeys who visit the garden in search of fresh vegetables.Monkeys eat our entire tomato crop. So to keep them at bay, we installed a scare crow, said Aaradhya Patil, 13.On each patch of garden, there are boards with information on the plants and their uses. For example, pentas plant is used as a popular medicine in malaria and lime to relieve asthma.Kids should understand how the plants are grown from scratch and that even a day of not watering can take away all their hard work, said Priyanka Shah, founder, iKheti, adding In this way, they also learn to respect food and become sensitive towards the environment.Organic fertilisersThe compost that they use in the garden comes from the waste created in the school campus. The school has eight drums in a set of four for each division where they dump organic waste, which is later used as fertiliser.Students do all the legwork they can for the environment. Aerobic composting is something that you just have to dump it and almost everything else is taken care of the microorganisms. The students of the school make sure that no waste goes out to the dump yard from the school, said Natasha DCosta, SUN founder.After the crop comes to fruition, the saplings are handed over to the students. Sanket Gauri, a student of Class VIII, said, We showed it to our parents and friends, and now even they want to be a part of it. My neighbours liked it so much that they want to start gardening on our terrace as well.The students are not just young environmentalists, but they are exceptional in studies as well. They recently won a Science Club Competition last year.My favourite subject is Maths, but this [terrace gardening] is Science, Chemistry, Geography and all other subjects put to practice, said Essakkimuthu Konar, 14, as he held his self-irrigation bottle with his name labelled on it.Also read: Teen powers change, helps buildings, schools recycle 350 kg of batteries"
