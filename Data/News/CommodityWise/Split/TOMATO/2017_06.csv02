Its good to dump our crop on the road, he said.While some farmers blamed it on demonetisation and cash crunch, Shajapur mandi secretary Rajesh Mishra dismissed the allegations, saying high supply and low demand had caused the prices to fall.The Madhya Pradesh government had announced facilities such as cash vans and transport subsidy for farmers to face cash crunch, but farmers claimed they are yet to receive them.According to sources, the daily supply of tomatoes at Shajapur mandi is around 200 to 300 crates as many farmers are sending their crop directly to Bhopal and Indore markets.They claimed that the rates were decent at Indore and Bhopal mandis."

Farmers of Bhandra, Kero, Kuru and Senha blocks of Lohardaga district and in Ranchi and other parts of the country Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradeshhave been dumping their tomatoes, onions and French beans.Huge dumps of vegetables were seen along Ranchi-Tata highway (NH-33) near Bhuinyadih vegetable market in Ranchis Tamar block after having been forced to sell their produce at throwaway prices because of bumper crop and cash crunch.The National Institution for Transforming India (Niti) Aayog in a recent paper admitted to the slump in vegetable prices, but attributed it to the bumper crop and not demonetisation of Rs 500/1000 notes.We are in catch-22 situation. Traders are not buying our produce. We neither able to sell the vegetable nor to take it at home, Jaipal Singh Munda, a tomato farmer, said.Jagdish Mahato, a trader at Bhuinyadih wholesale market, said, Tomatoes and French beans are being sold at Rs 1-2 a kg in the market while cauliflower is Rs 5 a piece for last few days.However, the price of tomato is Rs 6-10 a kg, French beans and cauliflower Rs 10 in vegetable markets in Ranchi city.With good monsoon this year, farmers have produced bumper crops in the country.Traders purchasing power has declined after demonetisation. They have restricted their orders. West Bengal traders are not coming to buy vegetables from Jharkhand at this time, said Nakul Mahato, a vegetable grower from Ranchis Pithoria area, who also sells vegetables to West Bengal.State horticulture director Rajiv Kumar said Jharkhand recorded bumper crops this year. So, it is natural the demand will fall. We are trying to increase the demand through advertising significance of tomato on health.He said residents would be requested to buy tomato and store them as ketchup.Next year onwards, vegetable route will also be defined where farmers will be requested to produce different vegetables so that farmers do not see such situation, he said.Jharkhand is a known for surplus vegetable production. According to Jharkhand state horticulture mission (JSHM), the state produces around 38 lakh metric tonne vegetables annually against a requirement of 30 lakh metric tonne. The state exports around one million tonne vegetables to other states every year."

Picture by Ashwinee PatiBhubaneswar: Gothapatna resident Shanti Lata Rath had to run from one vendor to another on Saturday to buy fresh groceries. When she did find a vendor with a relatively fresh stock, she was stunned by the price that the he asked for.Rath wasn't the only one to go through such an ordeal.Rumours of a cyclonic storm hitting the state not only emptied vegetable markets, but also saw prices soar. The most affected were the smaller shops. Tomato prices rose to Rs 50 to 60 a kg from Rs 40 earlier, while cabbage was selling at Rs 50 a kg compared to Rs 30 a kg last Monday. Prices of potato and onion also witnessed a sharp rise to Rs 15 and Rs 40 compared to Rs 10 and Rs 30 earlier.""I prefer fresh vegetables and buy them daily. However, it seems that my practice came heavy on my family and me. It has been raining for the past two days and the vegetable shops have nothing apart from cabbage and potato,"" said Rath, a homemaker.Old Town resident Sushil Hota faced a similar predicament. ""Such rumours of cyclones affecting daily markets, mainly in October, have become a yearly practice. I was aware of the situation, but failed to stock the essentials, so had to suffer for that. I had a tough time finding tomatoes at the market,"" said the schoolteacher.Small vegetable vendors in the city suffered the most because of the hoax as they failed to provide bare essentials even to daily customers.""I bought vegetables from the wholesale market, but the prices there witnessed a dramatic rise. I was forced to get the vegetables at much higher prices and sell them,"" said a vendor at CRP Square.On Wednesday, the regional meteorological centre here traced a deep depression over the Bay of Bengal and predicted heavy to very heavy rain for the city.""We rigorously monitored the system and never stated that it would intensify into any cyclonic storm. The system moved to neighbouring Jharkhand on Saturday and weakened gradually into a well-marked low pressure. Rainfall in the city will stop, and it will be the same for the state from Sunday,"" said Met director Sarat Chandra Sahu."

At around 11:30am, Tripathi's SUV arrived. ""Do you know that on his suggestion only I have quit non-vegetarian food? I have become vegetarian now,"" Lalu told The Telegraph.Half an hour later he asked for lunch. His personal helper Azgar brought the food and kept it on a table. Lalu asked another person to keep fanning with a piece of cloth to keep the flies away.Lalu's lunch comprised saathi rice dal, a brinjal, potato and palak dish, a pumpkin preparation, tomato chutney, raw tamarind chutney, coriander and kundru. He rounded off the meal with fried green chana with a dash of salt.Saathi rice, from a paddy variety mainly grown in the Champaran region which becomes ready in 60 days, is considered auspicious in most north Bihar districts, including Lalu's native Gopalganj.Lalu ate heartily, using a spoon and leaving a bit on the plate as is his habit, and also asked RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari to have lunch but he declined politely. Lalu's wife Rabri Devi was sitting next to her husband.Asked if he had any prediction for Saturday's judgment, Tripathi said: ""No, prediction at all, he is the sun who gives light to everyone. Nobody can touch him.""Lunch done, Lalu took his medicines and went inside for a one-hour siesta.By the time he emerged, many MLAs had gathered at his residence.As soon as Lalu came out from the room, he asked the timing of his flight from his close aide Bhola Yadav. He said 3:30pm and suggested Lalu leave within an hour. Lalu asked his doctor about the timing of medicines. The doctor said Bhola has been briefed.When a flight passed above his residence, Lalu looked at Rabri and said: ""Is this the same flight I am supposed to catch?""Rabri said: ""No, you have another flight. Just drink your lemon tea, you have half an hour left. At 3 pm, Lalu got into his SUV. Younger son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav followed, after touching the feet of his mother."

The trend will continue till Chhath as many people will only consume vegetarian dishes during the course of the festival.Residents, however, are feeling the pinch of the price rise - a pair of cauliflowers available for Rs 50 now costs Rs 100. Similarly, bottle gourd, which was available for Rs 20 a piece, now costs Rs 40 per kg. Even the price of onion has gone up from Rs 20 per kg to Rs 45 per kg.Be it pointed gourd, bitter gourd, sponge gourd, ladies finger, brinjal, tomato or potato, the price of all the vegetables have soared. The most expensive among them is coriander which now stands at Rs 400 per kg.On the sudden price rise, Bablu, a vegetable seller at Rajapur Pul vegetable market, said: ""The price of vegetables has increased just before Diwali and it will continue till Chhath. It is not in our hands as we are also purchasing it at higher prices so we do not have any option but to sell at higher rates to make up the margin.""People who are involved in wholesale business are responsible for charging unnecessary money as they know very well that residents have no other option but to purchase at higher rates.Residents, naturally, expressed pain over the price-rise.Richa Kumari, a housewife at the Boring Canal Road locality, said: ""Pointed gourd which was available at Rs 20 per kg now costs Rs 40 per kg. Similarly, the price of sponge gourd and ladies finger has equally jumped. In the winter season, we love coriander sauce and it is really expensive; a little bit of coriander is not enough to make sauce. God knows when the prices will come down.""Agriculture department deputy director and agriculture expert Anil Kumar Jha, however, said the reason behind the sudden rise in vegetable price is the transition period.""This is the time when summer is on its last lap and winter is approaching. Because of this, the seasonal vegetable is getting over and fresh vegetables are coming into the market. It is actually a transition period when the supply of vegetables is less. Once winter vegetables fully reach the market, the prices will automatically go down."" Jha told The Telegraph.He also admitted that the traders intentionally increase the price to make more money during the festive season specially Chhath as many people abstain from eating non-veg."

My brother clicking moments of treasure on his camera as we buzz through our little home in Bangalore. I did not sleep a wink that night, the night before I had to fly to my new home in USA.Thirty-two years since I left my childhood home, I wonder at the huge changes yet everything seems frozen in time in Bangalore. The moon winks at me in the dark night but my jet-lagged body reminds me of pangs of lunch hunger. The airports have changed but it is still the same warm moist air enveloping me as I walk out of the jet way.

5b2e93039855b72640116345,Make MSP legally binding,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/667222/make-msp-legally-binding.html,2017-12-12,"For over two weeks last month, farmers in Chhattisgarh's Durg district dumped tomatoes on to the streets. In just one village, Parsuli, an estimated 100 quintals was either fed to cattle or left to rot in the crop fields. After a relatively better marketing season that lasted till the first week of January, retail prices plunged.Far away, farmers in Erode district in Tamil Nadu were a worried lot after the retail price of cabbage crashed. From Rs 12/kg last year, it dropped to as low as Re 1 per kg. In Chhattisgarh, too, tomato prices crashed, leaving farmers in the lurch.Not fetching more than Rs 2 per kg, farmers simply abandoned the tomato harvest. The deplorable price they get in the market is not even enough to meet the plucking and harvesting cost.This is primarily because of higher production. Whether it is cabbage, tomato, potato, onions or any other crop, the higher the production, lower is the price. A higher production enables middlemen to form cartels and manipulate prices, often to the extent of exploitation.T Rajaganesh, a farmer in Erode district, asks: ""Farmers spend at least Rs 45,000 per acre a month to cultivate cabbage. Add to it the cost of labour, maintenance and fertiliser, and the cost shoots up to more than Rs 50,000 a month.Since it takes almost three months to yield, we have to spend at least Rs 1.5 lakh per acre before harvesting. How can we realise a profit with a farmgate price of Rs 1 per kg?""In the case of tomato too, average cost of production is about Rs 90,000-1 lakh per acre for small farmers. For the big farms, the production cost is a little higher, at Rs 1.25 lakh per acre.Till the first week of January, when I travelled to meet tomato farmers in Durg, the prices were much better - about Rs 1,000 per crate of 25 kg. But, with the advent of tomato crop from Karnataka, the supplies swelled, and prices slumped.Now, let's take the case of chana. According to news reports, chana prices are ruling at about Rs 3,600 per quintal, against the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 4,400 per quintal, a drop of 20% in the retail price.With production expected to increase to 10 million tonnes this year (from 9.33 million tonnes last year), prices are expected to dip with arrivals picking up. Even wheat price has remained below MSP by 6-8% in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, where early crop harvest hit the mandis.In February last week, market price for tur dal was ruling at Rs 4,500 per quintal, against the procurement price of Rs 5,500 at Tandur market in Telangana.Meanwhile, reports of tomato being dumped on the streets in Chhattisgarh poured in again in early March. This is the third year in a row when tomato prices have crashed to Re 1 per kg. In fact, this is the third year in a row when prices of almost all agricultural commodities have crashed across the country.Karnataka modelAfter two years of drought in 2014 and 2015, production picked up after a favourable monsoon in 2016 and 2017. While the increase in production has brought cheers to the government, the drop in prices has added to the misery of farmers.It is here that I see the relevance of a very timely suggestion made by Dr TN Prakash, chairman of the Karnataka Agricultural Prices Commission. He has called for making the Minimum Support Price of crops to be legally binding. He said: ""Consumers have legal protection if produce is sold above MRP and can approach the courts. But, even after 70 years of Independence, farmers don't have similar protection.""For the third year in a row, prices of almost all commodities are at 20-45% lower than MSP in various parts of the country. At times of glut, traders ruthlessly exploit farmers. Even the introduction of the Unified Market Platform in Karnataka, which led to the expansion of 585 eNAM (National Agricultural Market) throughout the country, farmers have not gained.The concept of model price, which is based on the average of the day's trading, is in reality a distress price and needs to be dispensed with. eNAM in reality is a nationwide platform being created to make it profitable for spot trading.In addition to 23 crops for which MSP is announced every year, state governments must work out MSP for highly perishable commodities like tomato, potato, onion and other vegetables.Many states already have a Farmers' Commission, which has more or less become retiring rooms for political appointees.The immediate need is to convert them into State Agricultural Prices Commission, with the mandate to provide higher income to farmers, similar to that in Karnataka. If Karnataka can ensure procurement of 14 crops at prices much higher than the MSP announced by the Centre, I see no reason why other states cannot."
5b5061f69855b70b4a41aa49,Back to waste basics,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/back-to-waste-basics-solid-waste-management-swachh-bharat-4767068/,2017-07-26,"Rag pickers look for reusable materials at a garbage dump littered with polythene bags in Lucknow. (AP Photo/Rajesh Kumar Singh) Rag pickers look for reusable materials at a garbage dump littered with polythene bags in Lucknow. (AP Photo/Rajesh Kumar Singh)The challenge of solid waste management in Indian cities is now receiving belated but welcome attention and about time too. Rising incomes and changing lifestyles are generating more waste and of a different kind, but we are yet to set up systems to deal with the build-up. Swachh Bharat Mission provides an opening, but much more needs to be done on the ground.Waste was not such a problem in India until the 1970s. In our rural areas, food discards were returned to the soil. Food leftovers were fed to animals and the cattle-shed wastes were thrown in a pit to decompose and become manure for the next planting season. This returned both NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) nutrients as well as micronutrients to the soil for healthy crops.Urban food discards were also recognised as a potential resource, not a waste. In Portuguese Goa, bullock carts would move from bungalow to bungalow, collecting kitchen leftovers for on-farm composting. This was the earliest Indian version of doorstep waste collection. In big cities like Bangalore, farmers would bring their produce to town for early-morning auctions, then move to the cement-ring waste bins at street corners and empty them to take back home and produce manure. In fact, they would fight over collection rights for this fertile resource. This age-old practice kept Indian soils rich in carbon, up to 4 per cent.All this changed with the beginning of the plastic era in the 1970s. Some readers will recall how plastic bags were initially cherished as a useful item for hoarding in our homes, carefully taken out for re-use when needed. As the bags became more common, poor quality, and disposable, we began throwing them away into our kitchen waste-bins. When farmers took such mixed waste to their farms, the fields wore a non-biodegradable plastic film, preventing rain from entering the soil and keeping seeds from germinating through them  an example of negative urban-rural connectivity.Two useful resources, biodegradable waste and plastic, when mixed together, became waste and remained uncollected. Add to this the mixing of other dry waste and the debris from construction and demolition down the supply chain of waste, and this assorted mixed waste presents a major management challenge for the municipal authorities.City managers forced to deal with this growing waste began collecting and dumping the same outside the city limits. Since nearby farms and villages did not want this mixed waste either, it often ended up along the sides of roads leading out of town. These convenient ribbons of no mans land were not managed or defended by anyone. When even these filled up with ridges of waste, cities found larger areas outside to create mini hills of mixed waste.These rotting heaps of waste, denied oxygen from the air, emit methane (CH4) which is over 21 times more potent as a heat trapping gas than carbon dioxide. They generate ammonia which smells like dirty urinals and nauseating hydrogen sulphide which smells like rotten eggs. The airless heaps also produce leachate, a black liquid oozing out from the waste. Imagine a rotten tomato in a plastic bag which turns to a smelly liquid, unlike a similar rotten tomato which is left in the open air and dries to powder. This example illustrates the importance of aerating the waste heaps.Waste heaps without adequate exposure to air take 25-30 years to slowly decompose, continuously releasing methane and leachate. This leachate seeps down into the soil and contaminates open wells and after a longer time even reaches and pollutes bore wells through deep natural water channels. When waste is dumped in low-lying areas or quarry pits, the hydrostatic pressure of so much water-logging forces the leachate into water veins even faster. There is no way to treat this deep underground contamination, which makes wells and bore wells unfit for drinking and even for irrigation for decades.Households need to be made to stop mixing biodegradable waste with dry waste (paper, plastic, glass, etc) and keep hazardous domestic waste completely separate. The segregation of waste at source into wet (compostable), dry (recyclable) and sanitary (disposable diapers and sanitary napkins) categories is now compulsory for all citizens of India in the Solid Waste Management Rules 2016. However, residents typically complain that the waste is mixed again in the door-to- door collection process. While demanding high standards for door-to-door collection, we must continue with our discipline at home.In 2003, Suryapet in Andhra Pradesh was the first Indian city to process its wet waste, recycle its dry waste and leave nothing for landfilling. Vengrula in Maharashtra and Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu are the latest of over 20 urban local bodies to achieve near zero waste to landfill. The wet waste needs to be collected and processed daily, either composted at home or taken to nearby locations for decentralised composting or biogas production or taken to centralised plants. At the very least, the waste needs to be stabilised as described below. The correct way to manage fresh waste is to expose as much of it to air as soon as possible. Worldwide, the standard way of doing this is to unload the waste in windrows, not high heaps.Windrows are long low parallel heaps of waste, not more than two metres high, which are designed to achieve the best conditions for aerating the waste. Only parking-lot type management is required to guide incoming vehicles on where and how to unload their waste, moving slowly forward and leaving the waste behind in a long row. Enough space is left between rows for a lifting tractor or earthmover to drive through and turn the waste in the windrow.The outer aerated waste should form the inner core of a new windrow, and the airless centre of the old heap now on the outside. Weekly turning of the waste, repeated at least four times, ensures that all parts of the waste are fully decomposed, like leaves on a forest floor, turning dark brown and with a sweet earthy smell. The process can be speeded up by the addition of composting bio-cultures (fresh cow dung or substitutes available in the market).Fresh waste windrows heat up inside, to about 55C to 60C in three to four days. After four turnings, there is about 40 per cent weight loss as moisture content declines and also about 40 per cent volume reduction. After this, no leachate or methane or smelly gases are released, and this fully stabilised waste is called compost, rich in microbes as well as humus, both wonderful for soil vitality.This bio-stabilising of biodegradable waste makes a city fully compliant with the SWM Rules 2016. Screening makes it more farmer-friendly and helps move useful fractions offsite to ensure continued long-term use of the same site for waste processing. The recycling of existing waste management space is one of the biggest advantages of waste stabilising and frees local bodies from the constant search for new sites to pollute and new urban rural battles over locations for waste processing.Ahluwalia is chairperson, ICRIER, Delhi, and former chairperson of the high-powered expert committee on urban infrastructure and services.

While warming of a status quo till end of January, officials of the Telangana states agricultural marketing department attribute the abnormal price rise to the excessive rains in onion-growing states such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and West Bengal.They predict a price correction by February.Late rainfall in September and October damaged the onion kharif crop in Telangana also. Due to this, the supplies are now coming in only from Maharashtra, said Padma Harsha , deputy director of department.Predictably, J Ananthaiah, selection grade secretary, agricultural market committee at Malakpet , said that the daily procurements have dropped from nearly 40,000 bags per day to 10,000-15,000 onions bags per day, thus pushing the rates northwards.The steep jump in costs has adversely impacted traders in other markets whove stopped selling onions. We cannot purchase onions at such a rise price. Hence, we are clearing our old stock. If the situation continues, we may be forced to keep our shops shut, said Mohammed Abid , a vegetable vendor at the Erragadda Rhythu Bazaar.Not just onions, prices of other vegetables such as tomato, cabbage, carrot too have registered a more than 200 per cent rise in price rise as compared to the last winter season. While one kg of tomato cost 8 in December 2016, the price has now shot to 26 per kg. The price of carrot has increased from 16 to 50 per kg.Onions and tomato are basic vegetables. With the price rise, we are now forced to purchase these vegetables in lesser quantities, said Vijayalaxmi, a housewife from Kokapet. The steep rise in cost of vegetables has driven inflation to an eight-month high of 3.93 per cent."

Weather will remain dry the rest of the time.Moderate to dense fog is likely to occur at isolated places on December 13 and 14. Weather is likely to remain dry for the next two days. Maximum and minimum temperature is expected to hover between 16 and 21 degrees celsius and 5 to 12 degree celsius respectively. Maximum relative humidity is expected to remain between 78% and 90 % and minimum between 42% and 68 % during these days. Farmers sowing the gram crop are advised to use 36 kg seed per acre. They should treat the seed in termite-infested soil with Dursban 20 EC (chlorpyriphos) @ 10 ml per kg seed. Under December sowing, transplanting of gobhi sarson is more profitable than direct sowing, say experts. Farmers have also been advised to use 60-day old seedlings of gobhi sarson (GSL-1), 35-40 day old seedlings for gobhi sarson hybrid Hyola PAC 401 and 30-35 day old seedlings for GSC 6.As clear weather is expected during the next 3-4 days, wheat crop cv. PBW 658 and PBW 590 should be sown. Farmers are advised to spray weedicides. To control gulli danda weed, farmers are advised to spray leader, safal, Marksulfo 75 WG (sulfosulfuron) @ 13 g/acre in 150 litres of water.They are also advised to treat wheat seed with 13 ml Raxil Easy/Orius 6 FS by dissolving it in 400 ml water or 120 g Vitavax Power 75 WS or 80 g Vitavax 75 WP or 40 g Seedex 2 DS/Exzole 2 DS per 40 kg seed, using seed treatment drum to control loose smut and flag smut of wheat. Farmers have been warned against treating seed a month before sowing as it hampers germination.They should manage rodent pests in wheat crop sown with Happy Seeder by burrow baiting with 2% zinc phosphide twice at an interval of 10 to 15 days after sowing of crop (a week before or after irrigation) during this period. Farmers are also advised to spray magnesium sulphate in deficit soils where the wheat crop is 24 to 25 days old.They are advised to conduct regular surveillance of their fields for late blight of potato and if symptoms appear, spray the crop with Indofil M-45/Markzeb/Kavach @ 500-700 g in 250-350 litres of water per acre. For judicious use of pesticides, follow DSS for management of late blight of potato. If there is curling of leaves, farmers should uproot plants or damage infected plants. To control rust in pea, spray 500 g of Indofil M-45 in 200 litres of water. It is the optimum time for transplanting of nursery of tomato and brinjal and sowing of European varieties of radish, turnip and carrot should also be completed.Its time to protect fruit plants, particularly young ones, from low temperature and prepare thatches on young fruit plants. Ensure irrigation to ber trees as fruit is in developmental stage. Spray Karathane (0.5ml) or Bayleton (0.5 g) or Wettable Sulphur (2.5 g) per litre water to check powdery mildew in ber. To check physiological fruit drop in ber, spray Naphthlene Acetic Acid (NAA) @ 15g per 500 litres of water per acre. Dissolve NAA in alcohol before mixing in water.New-born calves need special care in the cold as they are susceptible to pneumonia. They should be fed well-chaffed berseem mixed with wheat straw to avoid tympany (Aphara). Do not feed parali (rice straw) alone to animals because it is rich in silica and causes diarrhoea. Teat dipping should be done with a solution of glycerine and betadine mixed in a ratio of 1:4 to take care of mastitis and teat cracking. All animals should be vaccinated against foot and mouth disease (FMD)."
5b5088d89855b708a7ccca2f,Veggie buyers feel price pinch,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/veggie-buyers-feel-price-pinch/articleshow/62060198.cms,2017-12-14,"BHOPAL: A steep hike in vegetables prices is leaving an unsettling effect on consumers home budget this winter. At this time of the season, a fresh and affordable stock of vegetables brings down the prices. But it does not look so for consumers this season. From traders to experts, nobody seems to have a definite answer for the spike. Some traders said monsoons played the spoilsport, some others heaped the blame on demonetisation and GST.With the onset of winter, when prices of vegetables are lower, consumers are shelling out as high as Rs 50 per kg for many vegetables. Take for example onions till the time of filing this report, the price of onion in the local markets for Rs 50-Rs 60 per kg, this when price hike has eased considerably. I purchased onions a few days ago for Rs 80, said Rajesh Kumar Saxena, a government official.Tomatoes were available at Rs 8-10 per kg last year. Till Tuesday evening, it was at steep Rs 60 per kg. On Wednesday, tomato prices somewhat cooled. Vendors say it will take at least a week to 10 days for prices to come down.WHAT THE VENDORS SAYDemonetisation effect could be the reason for this hike in tomato prices, say some vendors.Good quality tomatoes take 50-100 days to grow depending on the variety. Usually people begin sowing in May-June after the summer harvest. By winters, tomato is ready. However, this year there is less quantity of tomato this season. Small farmers who sell their produce directly in the market have been removed from the process this years, said Shri Kant, a local vegetable vendor in Bagsewani vegetable market, adding that there was a disruption in the production cycle induced by demonetisation.According to Abdul Raqib , president of Aloo Pyaaz Wholesaler Association , ill-timed monsoons resulted in wastage of many crops this year. The monsoon was unpredictable this year. There were no rains for better part of the monsoon season, but there were flash rains in the end. This lead to a crop failure in many parts which is why, there is less supply this season and more demand leading to push in prices. Raqib, however, said hike in tomato prices is likely to ease in coming days and have already seen a drop since Wednesday. The retail prices of vegetables are around 35-50% higher than the wholesale rate, due to wastage of perishable goods in winter. For example: The wholesale price of onion is Rs 30 per kg, whereas in market Rs 60.Other perishables like potatoes, cauliflower, peas, green onion, green leafy vegetable, pumpkin, brinjals are also seeing a price fluctuations because of the same. Vendors, however, say prices of seasonal vegetables will stabilise in the next two to three days.WHAT THE RESIDENTS SAYThis has been troubling Bhopalis as they have to make do without an essential vegetable in their winter platter. Tomatoes and onions are used in almost every Indian dish. These are essential products which cannot be substituted for anything else. This hike in prices upset my daily grocery budget, said Natasha Matani , an engineer, working with a private company. This pattern, however, is not limited to Bhopal alone, but is a nationwide phenomenon. According to government data, inflation based on consumer food price index rose to 4.42% from 1.90% a month ago and 2.03% a year ago, whereas vegetable prices have increased to 22.48% in November from 7.47% last month.This despite the fact that Madhya Pradesh saw a bumper onion crop this season.Some residents feel the government is also to be blamed for this. Every day we read in news that onion has been rotting in the open. In a country where people are still struggling for daily meals, government should have not let so much food get waste, said Matani. There were others who said that the administration should intervene as the prices are burning a hole in the pocket of common people. Maladministration and crop wastage lead to such a situation. The government should intervene to ensure easy distribution of vegetables in markets so that we do face loss due to poor administration, said Reeta Prakasham , an educationist.WHAT THE EXPERTS SAYAfter initial slim pickings of food crops in few months post-demonetisation, many farmers were forced to terminate their summer crop due to which there is shortage of tomato supply in the market this season. Experts say during this time last year with demonetisation, the sapped currency supply lead to sudden decrease in prices. The farmers needed money and traders did not have it, which is why they had to sell their products cheap which eventually lead to less sowing in the next season. The effect of which is becoming apparent this winter.B L Sharma, an economist in the Madhya Pradesh Planning Commission, says as the winter intensifies, prices of perishables will drop. Prices are expected to come down in coming few days after the winter intensifies. Perishables are dependent on weather and also on the demand supply gap. When demand goes up, vendors stock supplies to take advantage of it, further pushing prices.State horticulture director Satyanand said, The rise and fall in prices is due to market forces, which balance themselves on their own. When there is a gap between harvest and sowing new crop, this problem comes up, which will get solved as soon as the new stock arrives.However, there are many, who blame demonetisation and GST for the same. Indias perishable market is a cash-based mandi dependent system. Even though cash has come back in overall circulation, it is yet to be efficiently circulated in the mandis. Over a year has gone by, but payments are still being done in cashless method, which is not convenient to small and medium farmers, said an expert seeking anonymity.The surge in prices is also due to delay in reaction to the supply and demand. Due to disturbed production of perishable goods this year, the market is not very flexible to demand and supply changes this year. For example, if demand increases for a vegetable, it will take time for market forces to adjust themselves to accommodate the rise in demand with the supply, since the mandis and wholesale markets are still not running efficiently as compared to previous years, the expert said, adding that another week might give the market enough time to adjust with the demand leading to a stable rate."

The video went viral on social media on Tuesday.Someone had told me that you cannot eat what Modi eats every day because it is not the poor peoples food. I asked him what kind of food does he (PM) eat? The person told me Modiji eats mushrooms. I told him what is the big deal in this, as mushrooms are available here also. He then told me that Modi does not eat what you people eat here. He gets imported mushrooms from Taiwan. The mushrooms which are imported from Taiwan cost around Rs 80,000 each. I was amazed. He went on saying Modi Saheb consumes five mushrooms a day, says Alpesh in the video.Alpesh further said in the video that to a query, he was told by the person that Modi has been eating mushrooms since he was CM (of Gujarat).Now, I know the reason why he became so fair as he was as dark as me earlier. I have also seen his 35-year-old photographs when he was as dark as me. Now he is glowing like a tomato and has also become healthy, Thakor said in the video. The OBC leader, however, was not available for his comments despite repeated attempts."

The retail price, however, has remained more unchanged.While green peas prices have spiraled to Rs 40-45/kg in wholesale market from Rs 25 on Wednesday, pushing the retail price to Rs 70-80/kg from the earlier Rs 50-60, the low supply of capsicum from Palghar due to the recent unseasonal rain has pushed up the wholesale rates to Rs 30-35 a kg from 25-30. Capsicum is currently retailed at Rs 60-70/kg from Rs 50-60 earlier.However, tomato prices have dropped to Rs 20 from Rs 25-30/kg in the wholesale market, bringing down the retail price too to Rs 40-50/kg from Rs 50-60 on Wednesday. It was sold at Rs 40-55 in Andheri.Onion prices rose in wholesale market despite the arrival of 125 trucks on Thursday, said potato-onion wholesale trader Ashok Walunj. APMC received just 30 trucks on Wednesday as against 110 trucks on Tuesday. However, the prices had remained unchanged with poor turnout of retailers. The rates are expected rise further and then stabilize in the next couple of weeks. While red onions were retailed at Rs 45-50/kg at Andheri-Versova, old onions were sold at Rs 55-60.Experts say the recent showers may have affected the quality of onions. Even a days non-seasonal rain can cause a lot of damage to the crop that is being harvested. The quantum is yet to be ascertained; a clear picture will emerge by next week, said Manohar Totlani, a trader. The harvest may get delayed by almost a week due to wet ground conditions, where farmers avoid collecting the crop.Early this week, wholesale onion prices had dropped to Rs 25-30/kg from Rs 30-35, attributing to arrival of fresh crop armed with the Centres cap on export by raising the minimum export price. But after the unseasonal showers on Monday and Tuesday, the prices have shot up yet again. Vegetable prices will remain uncertain till this weekend. The picture will be clear by Monday when the quantum of damage crop is expected to come to fore, said Balasaheb Badade, a trader.Mumbaikars are worried about the rising prices. Kandivli resident Abhijeet Thakur said, There has been no relief from expensive vegetables for the last few months. We have reduced the quantity to adjust the kitchen budget. The prices of other vegetables have remained mostly unchanged despite only 450 truckloads arriving in the APMC compared to the usual supply of 500-600 trucks. After a spell of inflation, vegetable prices were normalizing, but rain played spoilsport. A small bundle of coriander costs Rs 20 against the earlier Rs 10, said Mahim resident Rekha Sharma."
