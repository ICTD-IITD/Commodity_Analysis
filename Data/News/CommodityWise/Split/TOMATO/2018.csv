5a53b3e09855b770e038277e,Horticulture crop output seen at record 305.4 mt in 2017-18,http://www.livemint.com/Politics/V7EcEZlz9jT3bjLsyoiSpK/Horticulture-crop-output-seen-at-record-3054-mt-in-201718.html,2018-01-02,,Livemint,"Within horticulture, production of vegetables is estimated at 181 mt in 2017-18, about 1% higher than the year before, while that of fruits is estimated at 95 mt, 2% higher than the previous year. Photo: Indranil Bhoumik/MintNew Delhi: Production of horticulture crops like vegetables and fruits is likely to touch a record 305.4 million tonnes (mt) in 2017-18, about 1.6% higher than the previous year and 8% higher than the previous five years average, the agriculture ministry said in its first advance estimates released on Tuesday.The final estimates for 2016-17 released alongside showed that production of these perishable crops was 300.6 mt, a year-on-year rise of over 5%.Within horticulture, production of vegetables is estimated at 181 mt in 2017-18, about 1% higher than the year before, while that of fruits is estimated at 95 mt, 2% higher than the previous year.Data showed that during the year, area under different perishable crops stood at 24.9 million hectares, about 0.3% higher than the year before. Between 2015-16 and 2017-18, productivity of horticulture crops rose from 11.7 tonnes per hectare to an estimated 12.3 tonnes per hectare.Disaggregated data on estimates of production of specific crops showed onions at 21.4 mt, about 4.5% lower than the year before, and potatoes at 49.3 mt, marginally higher than the 48.6 mt in 2016-17. Production of tomatoes is estimated to rise 7.7% year-on-year in 2017-18 to 22.3 mt, showed the data.The record production during 2017-18 will mark the sixth straight year of horticulture production outstripping that of foodgrains (estimated at 276mt in 2016-17), suggesting a structural change in Indian agriculture where farmers are increasingly growing perishable commercial crops due to a growing market and a quicker cash flow as these crops require less time from sowing to marketing.However, price volatility continues to be a major risk in horticulture, with prices of onions, tomatoes and potatoes plunging below growing costs several times last year. While farmers in Madhya Pradesh were forced to sell onions as low as Rs2 per kg in June last year, in northern India, farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were forced to dump their potato crop for want of buyers around the same time.Retail and wholesale prices of perishables are also at a large variance from each other, implying fragmented markets and poor cold chain facilities. For instance, while tomatoes are currently selling for as low as Rs2-4 per kg in wholesale markets in Andhra Pradesh, they are retailing at Rs35 per kg in Delhi."
5a581ffe9855b770e038337c,Over 100 years of whisking away B’lureans,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2018/jan/10/over-100-years-of-whisking-away-blureans-1750276.html,2018-01-11,,The New Indian Express,"BENGALURU: For anyone who has grown up in Bengaluru, before the mushrooming of various bakery chains and outlets, the iconic Iyengar bakeries, found around every street corner, were go-to spots for the softest sponge cakes, fresh buns and crispy puffs. The heady aroma of bread being brought out of the oven would envelop the entire locality, a smell that takes many back to carefree childhood days.Over the years, people have moved on to fancier bakeries, but those loyal to Iyengar bakeries, some of which have crossed the 100-year mark, continue to be customers, sometimes traveling far off to their favourite one, or waking up in the wee hours to get a fresh batch of buns.Bakeries places to socialise in Colonial timesCity-based historian Arun Prasad says that the art of baking dates back to the time of the Roman Empire, and was eventually popularised by the British, who took the art to the countries they colonized. In Colonial times, bakeries were primarily spaces to socialize, he says.British army officers brought cakes and cookies from England to India. Though it is hard to trace the exact history, it is certain that it was the Iyengar community, who learnt baking from the British, that brought bakeries to the city, and these became popular for their high quality, hygeinic food, says Prasad.2)Owner of BB Bakery with fresh vegetable toast3)Oldest Iyengar Bakery in city, BB Bakery, Kengeri4) Sreenivas with his wife at the bakery5)Chocolate chip cookies fresh out of oven at BB BakeryHe says that these Tamil-speaking Iyengars travelled to different parts from the Hassan district  one theory is that they came looking for jobs, the other is that there was a draught that forced them to relocate. This sect of Iyengars are called Hebbar Iyengars, and were followers of Ramanujam. They were also referred to as Ashtangrama Iyengars, owing to the fact that they were from eight different villages within the Hassan district. Though the period of migration is uncertain, it is known that these Iyengars were employed by the British for various jobs  some in administrative posts, others as helpers on private estates, which is how they learnt how to bake. Despite being a vegetarian community, they started using egg for baking purposes.After the 1950s, Iyengar bakeries became popular throughout the city, and the community became known as bakery Iyengars or bread Iyengars. However, several other people, outside the community, opened up these bakeries by banking on the same name, says Prasad.First Iyengar bakery in city estd in 1898Prasad says that there was a theory that the first Iyengar bakery in the city was started in the 1890s by a family from Hassan, and was a sweet shop before it became a bakery.Shedding some light on this is Pavithra, whose father, Sreenivas, runs BB Bakery, apparently the first Iyengar bakery in the city, started in 1898. Pavithra says that her great grandfather Thirumalachar, ran a sweet shop in Chikpet, and was taught how to bake bread by a British man, whose name is unknown. After buns, Thirumalachar started selling bread and cakes too.My father was never inclined towards studies, and despite his fathers hesitance towards him joining the business, he decided to take over, and I plan on carrying on the legacy after him, says Pavithra, adding that the buns are their most popular item till date, as their size and taste make them very unique and sought after.Though BB Bakery moved out of its old home in Chikpet, due to issues with the owner, and has relocated to Kengeri now, Pavithra says that loyal customers, some of whom have been visiting for the last 50 years, still come all the way. She says her father wakes up at 5am everyday, at his age, to ensure his customers get fresh buns. Despite him not being keen on his three daughters taking over, they dont want the over-a-century-old family business to die out.6)Hot and crispy vegetable puffs at BB Bakery7) Famous bun-butter-jam at Iyengar Bakery, Austin Town8)Sreenivas stacking baked goods at BB Bakery9)Freshly baked buns at Iyengars Bakery, Austin Town10) Loaves of bread at Iyengars Bakery, Austin TownWay forwardPavithra says that business has changed over the years. Earlier, people would pick up in bulk, but now, its become on a more day-to-day basis, where people pick up just what they need for that day.My father keeps experimenting and innovating now to keep the products selling. The tomato bun, pudina bun, kaju khara, choco-gems cookies and choco-strawberry cookies are newer items, and they have been doing well. My father just wants to keep his customers satisfied, she says, adding that to keep up with the times, her younger sister has started a Facebook page and rebranded the bakery with a new logo too.Raman and Lakshmeesha, brothers to run Iyengars Bakery in Austin Town, say that their father started the bakery back in 1981. The baked good they are known for are bun-butter-jam, plain cakes and nippat.We sell 250 products, from buns to namkeen to cakes. We have started online orders, and are the only Iyengar bakery that is doing this. But we have noticed that these days, people are picking up goods just for their daily requirements.Nostalgia all the wayFor Ruth Dsouza Prabhu, a food writer, her earliest memories of Iyengar bakeries go back to when she first moved here to work, about 18 years back. I would go to the closest Iyengar bakery before work for breakfast and pick up an aloo bun or a khaara bun, which is filled with a spicy mix of vegetables, and this would keep me satisfied for quite some time. The plain cakes are something I still pick up, and my daughter, who is extremely fussy about her food, tried this one first and that is how she took to eating cake  so I am thankful to Iyengar bakeries for this, she says.Prakash, 63, has lived in Bengaluru almost all his life, and Iyengar bakeries are part of his childhood in the city. As kids, we would go to the bakery and buy cream buns with the little pocket money we got  this was after school when all the neighbourhood boys would get together to play. Even now, some of my friends and I gather here in the evenings, some even bring their grandkids. But we dont eat cream buns anymore, he says laughing.Fakers stay awayOver the years, some people have started Iyengar bakeries without actually belonging to the community, which has resulted in legal issues. Raman says, People who arent from the community are using the name just to make their bakeries popular, they are not authentic. However, those who know which the authentic bakeries are, make sure they go only to the original ones, he says, adding that his only request to customers is to go to authentic Iyengar bakeries, and not take the others at face value."

Emotional abuse negatively affects a childs emotional development and is caused by withholding love or support for a child.In a survey, 36 per cent of Indian parents agreed to hit children as a form of punishment. 64 per cent of Asian (2-7 years) children are known to experience moderate to severe forms of abuse.Why is it a burden?Childhood abuse results in severe physical injuries, disabilities, poor cognitive and socio-emotional outcomes, behavioural problems, mental health issues throughout life and may lead to fatal outcome. Even mild forms of abuse pose children at risk of re-experiencing abuse. It is possible that it can evoke insecurity in a child.Neuroscientists who conducted brain imaging studies of children with history of abuse, have demonstrated long term abnormal brain changes in the areas related to emotion, motivation, attention and executive functions. Thus, quality of the relationship established in earlier life plays a fundamental role in development of social relationships and emotional regulation in later life.How can parents help?Support the child  Try to correct parent-child relationship, which in turn can prevent re-abuse, reduces parent-child conflict and reduces parental stress. This will improve family dynamics thus reducing child behavioural problems.Positive parenting - Understand right techniques to discipline your child rather than using physical means of punishment. Use of positive parenting skills which include positive reinforcement of child, trust building activities and spending quality time with the child are essential. In adolescents, it is a greater challenge as they frequently have lack of faith in the ability of family to help them handle aftermath of disclosure of abuse.Do not blame the child  Children who go through emotional abuse frequently give in to bribing or befriending the abuser due to fear of disclosure or guilt of being abused. Blaming the child will lead to double victimisation of the child, both by abuser and family.Be aware  Understanding a childs social network is very essential. Parents also have to be aware of online communication platforms that are now emerging as rampant forms of emotional abuse and exploitation of children and adolescents (eg Blue Whale app).Seek help  Children often use different ways to express when exposed to abuse including sudden onset school refusal, mood disturbances, aggression, sadness, anger outbursts, social withdrawal and acute decline in school performance. Look out for these symptoms early and seek professional help.Keep stigma away  Parents should keep stigma away when they identify need for support from a mental health professional. Parents should help the child regain their confidence. If the offender belongs to the family, measures to avoid repeated abuse should be taken.Provide good social support - It is very essential to develop good social support network that include parents, extended family, peers, teachers and professionals, as an abuse tends to create greater chance of a child or adolescent manifesting a psychiatric symptomatology later in life.

As the price for the day is announced disappointment is writ large on his face. At Rs80 per crate of 15kg, Tomato is threatening to bring tears in the eyes in this poll season for the farmers in this drought prone district.Good showers last monsoon had brought cheers for the farmers who had suffered consecutive years of drought. ""We can make some profit only if the price of tomato crosses Rs150 per crate and the price today will leave me incurring loss. With more farmers set to bring their produce to the market in the coming days I am really worried about the grim future. The price could fall below Rs50 per crate. It will be a disaster,"" adds Vishwanath Reddy, a tomato grower from Mangasandra village in Kolar.The familiar scene of farmers dumping their tomato produce on the roads as a mark of protest is likely to repeat, says Santosh, a tomato merchant who supplies tomatos from Kolar to not only places like Chennai, Kolkata, Rajasthan and other parts of the country, but even exports to Quatar and Pakistan. ""We are sending over 300 to 400 crates every day now to Quatar and Pakistan,"" claims Santosh.A perennially drought prone district, Kolar has carved a niche for itself in horticulture. The district is the main supplier of Mango and vegetables like tomato, cabbage, cauliflower and beans.We have been let down by our leadersWhile the tomato tale of tears is a recurring feature, the farmers of Kolar curse the failure of their leaders for letting them down in redressing their problem. ""We had agriculture ministers like C Byre Gowda, Srinivasa Gowda and now Krishna Byre Gowda from our own district, but without finding a lasting solution for our woes whether in getting water for our crops or ensuring a fair price and market for our produce,"" says Chandrappa who has branched out to sericulture apart from his tomato farming.Known as the district of 'Silk and Milk' for its strides in sericulture and dairy farming, the people are waking up for the electoral heat with their demands.""Setting up cold storage chains to store farm produce during the time of price crash, setting up agro-processing industries, speeding up projects like Yettinahole and Yarragolu ti bring water, giving push for industrial growth in the region,' tops our wish, says Chandrappa of Mudavadi village.The villages are already seeing the divide as the May 12 assembly election is approaching. In Mangasandra with a population of about 1000, the divide is clear between Above Poverty Line(APL) and Below Poverty Line(BPL) families and also caste divide between Vokkaliga, Kuruba,SC/ST and Minority communities. The Kolar constituency is witnessing tough fight between former agriculture minister Srinivasa Gowda of JD(S) and Syed Zameer Pasha of Congress. The Kuruba, SC/ST and Minority population is showing greater preference for Congress while the Vokkaliga and Reddy communities along with a few OBC castes are consolidating behind Srinivasa Gowda. While Om Shakti Chalapathy of BJP too is giving a fight, incumbent MLA Varthur Prakash of Namma Congress is determined to have the last laugh against his opponents from three bigger parties.While the BPL families are generally appreciative of Siddaramaiah government's welfare programmes, the APL families are miffed as they are not getting 30kg rice at concessional price of Rs10.Farming sustains the livelihood of about 60% of the population of the villagers, sericulture and dairy farming are drawing a large segment with hope of more steady income.Rain hits sweet dreams of Mango growersThe recent spell of rains and gale wings has hit the mango growers of Kolar and Srinivasapura. ""We had suffered due to a spell of untimely rains during the flowering season of mango. Just a couple of weeks back the fresh spell of rain and gusty winds has hit the crop,"" rues Chandrappa, a mango farmer in Srinivasapura.""Our yield is likely to go down by 30%. Now we are keeping our fingers crossed about the price we get,"" Chandrappa adds.Srinivasapura, the mango hub of the region is equally well known for its fierce political battle between Health Minister Ramesh Kumar and his arch rival Venkatashiva Reddy. The constituency has never seen its MLA score a repeat victory. It is always alternative terms for Ramesh Kumar and Venkatashiva Reddy here. Will Ramesh Kumar break the sequenced and humble Reddy again is the question that is being hotly debated in the constituency."

Your garden requires food and water. But,above all, it requires your love and affection, like your child, says 62-year-old PV Ramanna from Hyderabad. He started gardening in 1998. In the last 20 years, he has developed a number of hybrid plants over an area of 1,500 sq ft. He says, Gardening has been my hobby since childhood. When I used to work at ISCO fertilisers, I did not get much time to take care of my garden, but post-retirement, Im a full-fledged gardener. I could not be more content.His interests lies mainly in developing hybrid varieties of flowers. Lotus, jasmine, hibiscus, frangipani and lily plants have occupied a considerable space in his garden. He explains that flowers come in different shapes, sizes and hues. They are not just visually appealing, but enhance your mood too. A flower garden can be developed even by a novice with zero investment, he says. Apart from this, he has also developed an organic garden with vegetables and fruits.Vegetables include tomatoes, green chilies, lady fingers, eggplant and drumstick. He says, Planting a single tomato plant can give you 4 kgs of tomatoes in one entire season. By planting these in pots, you enjoy the pleasure of savouring delicious, sun-warmed vegetables fresh from your garden. Moreover, you dont have to go to the grocery store each time. Just pick the right spot, make sure the soil bed is not weed-ridden and there is plenty of sunlight.Mango, strawberry, pomegranate, banana, sapota are some of the fruits he grows. He makes sure the soil is free from pesticides and occasionally removes unwanted weeds. He has been using kitchen waste, dried leaves and cow dung to make compost. He spends around three hours in the morning and evening to water the garden. He has designed a rooftop water harvesting process that stores rainwater to water the plants, especially when there is water scarcity in the city.On his terrace garden, one can find a plethora of potted plants and birds. The potted plants are placed on a raised cemented platform. He says, Usually, the potted plants are placed on the terrace slab. The water draining out of these pots is wasted. I have designed cemented pots in such a way that the excess water flows into miniature tubs. Birds such as pigeons, crows, bulbuls and koels come here for their early morning bath. It is very pleasing and soothing to watch them, and the birds also stay hydrated during the scorching heat.The list does not end here. Ramanna also owns around eight aquariums with varieties of fish, including ten types of different coloured shrimp. He says that a garden is a major source of stress relief. He, along with his wife Uma Ramanna, are working together to promote the importance of plants in theirneighbourhood."

And Prema mami has a specific mission too. People should know that there is lot to offer in vegetarian Tamil cuisine, too,she says.Premas husband is also a chef. He used to work as a senior chef at a five-star hotel in Dubai. My husbands way of thinking is different from mine. I focus more on the homemade traditional recipes but I also like cooking North Indian and Chinese items, says Prema. Her daughters too draw inspiration from their mothers cooking, and continue to experiment interesting varieties on a daily basis, with her inputs.Prema cooked her first dish, the humble onion uthappam, when she was 10. For the last four years, Prema has been catering food in the US, and in Muscat for three years. Recollecting these experiences, Prema shares, Cooking for international crowd was special. They love homemade food. So they crave for anything fresh and not preheated.

The spread of 26 varieties starts with panagam (a summer health drink) and has a blend of variety rice, kuzhambu (curries), poriyal (vegetables), sweets like godhumai halwa (wheat), and wraps up with neer mor (buttermilk). We come during vacations to ensure that kids get a taste of these forgotten Tamil vegetarian recipes. Its not often that we make kodamilagai thayir pachadi (capsicum and curd salad) or kathirikai (brinjal) podi curry.

But meet Naina Siwach from Mumbai, who by her own confession, is a digital nomad. Planning, she says, is the key to making your travel dreams come true. In her 30s now, this former VP of a national PR company in Mumbai who is now 'location independent' and has chosen to become a consultant digital strategist and moved to Bali, Indonesia, in December 2017 as she feels the new job will help her travel yet work for a living. While many of us got inspired to spend at least two days at the La Tomatina Festival after watching Laila and Arjun fall in love with each other amidst the squishy tomatoes in Spain in the epic 2011 Bollywood movie Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, this girl actually managed to ring in her 30th birthday in Spain at the fest. ""Ever since I turned 21, I've managed to visit more than 30 countries and I hope to have 50 stampings in my passport before I turn 40."" she says. Naina was at The Philippines for her birthday in 2017 and she says she loves to do it the local style. Her holidays are dotted with archery, height ziplining, surfing, snorkeling, deep sea diving and more. She loves to hang out with the locals, eat like them and even rent a little studio apartment for herself when she travels. We ask her how she manages to do all of this and how to plan to explore the world. Excerpts from a conversation with this true blue nomadWhen did you start travelling solo?I ventured on my first solo travel at the rebellious age of 18, as a birthday gift to myself. I yearned to step out of my comfort zone and explore unchartered territories. The first trip was to Europe where I travelled for 30 days and it felt like the best 30 days of my life. Every day, I learnt the value of being true to myself and appreciating my moments of solitude. It changed me as a person and restored a newfound sense of independence within me. I understood how to adapt to different cultures, cuisines, languages and of course, money conversions most importantly. Every solo trip has enhanced the quality of my peace and happiness.What is it in solo travel that keeps you going again and again?Every solo trip has helped me grow and evolve as a person. It is an ideal stress buster and enables me to truly appreciate the value of my freedom and Independence and to be a better human being. It fills my soul with tranquillity. It is what I do to recover from life's many unpredictable blows, so I may refresh and rejuvenate myself and go back to face anything that comes my way with renewed energy. In a land where you meet new people, you realise you a mere speck in this vast diverse world. Taking yearly solo trips has been essential in teaching me to expand my boundaries and help me take a step back in my own life to appreciate the things I have been blessed with.How does one realise their dream of travelling the world while still holding a fulltime (often demanding) job?First earn well and save well ( a few lakhs in Indian Rupee to take care of emergencies). Then choose a job which allows you to work remotely. With the advent of mobile technology and superfast broadband and many companies also giving the remote work options, it is easier to find jobs in the new age economy. For instance, I was previously based in Mumbai and used to work fulltime as the Vice President of the luxury segment of a PR company. But now, thanks to my quest for travel, I travel wherever I want but to using my high end laptop and a super fast internet connection (luckily Bali has a good one), I work as a digital strategist for global brands. My work involves planning digital campaigns and promotions. So if your travel quest gets the better of you, this is the best way to go about life and your dreams.What are the three tips for Indian solo travellers to stay safe?During one of my solo trips to Amsterdam a few years ago, I recall feeling completely vulnerable and alone. Nonetheless, I decided to step outside my hostel and check out their famous Dutch apple pie cafe. My recommendation would be to step out of your fear zone and explore the city and trust me, this will redefine your definition of freedom. You can thank me later. The hacks that keep me safe or sorted are:- To blend in and dress like one of the locals.- Carry a dummy wallet. I keep my money and cards in my inner garments. So in case, anyone attempts to rob you, only the dummy wallet is lost.- Pepper spray is not allowed in air travel. So you can carry a mosquito spray or miniature hair spray if possible. That works too, in case of emergency to at least stump the intruder.- Pick Airbnb and hostels that have maximum reviews and are centrally located.- It is preferable to leave the DND sign on your door before leaving the hotel room.- Do not trust people easily. Stay alert and vigilant.Is there any process you follow on how you decide your next destination?Birthdays are special days and I want the best stuff those days. So for the last five years, I have made a pact to myself - to break boundaries and travel far and wide. As an avid traveller who uses almost every long weekend for some sort of travel (I started 2018 with the Thrissur Snake Boat Race festival), I have several exotic and unexplored destinations to discover. I am a thalassophile - a sea lover. The ebb and tide of the waves lull me into a new world whenever I play on the beach. So naturally, my travel is research-oriented and usually around beaches. I am an adventure freak so activities such surfing, diving and snorkelling with intriguing culture blends interest me. I celebrated my birthday in Balinese tradition in 2017.Share three travel hacks.Ans: Always make sure to inform your bank about the country you intend to visit along with the duration. Make sure you are familiar with the conversions and costs. Keep the emergency number of the bank in handy in case you lose your cards without fail.What are the destinations in your bucket list?There are three destinations and experiences I wish to complete before 2020 which are as follows:- I want to attempt the Lava Surf in Hawaii. It is said to be extremely dangerous, however, I wish to experience the thrill to ride waves on fire!- I want to walk through the magnificent Amazon rainforest. The starting point would be from Bolivia. This is an experience of a lifetime and I would recommend the same to all the solo travellers across the world.- I would like to travel across Japan for about four months during the Cherry blossom season. It begins to bloom in Okinawa, passes through the middle of Japan and finishes with a late bloom in northern Hokkaido.Ideally how much budget should a single Indian set aside for a week's travel abroad.. not too much luxury but not too much of a shoestring.. economy.It would depend on the destination. I wouldnt recommend Europe or USA for a week. The tickets are expensive and to justify that cost, you need to spend at least two to three weeks. If you want to go abroad for a week, I would recommend The Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand Islands, Cambodia and Vietnam. You can work within Rs 1.5 lakh including tickets, visa, stay, meal and intercity travel. If you are a shopaholic, then I recommend you downsize your credit limit to 50K so you dont splurge. However, avoid malls. Always visit flea markets and vintage storesWhat websites/ apps to plan your travel do you recommend?- TripIt - saves my travel itinerary, while the alerts are like my best travel buddies.- Airbnb for homestay.- Hostel World for any hostel bookings.- CityMapper - for any help in understanding local transport.- Google translate are my Go to apps as required.Any tips on snagging the best foreign travel dealsPlan in advance.

He has played host on Masterchef India and Junior Masterchef India and was invited to judge the semi-finale of Masterchef America with Chef Gordon Ramsey. He has been honoured with Dr. S Radhakrishnan National Media Network Award. The Indian Television Academy awarded him for the Best Jury/Anchor on television for Junior Masterchef India. Kapur is also the proud recipient of the prestigious Sir Edmund Hillary Fellowship 2012 from the Government of New Zealand in the field of Food & Beverage and has authored many cookbooks.Hometown: New DelhiEducation: Kapur studied at St Francis De Sales School in New Delhi and is an alumnus of Institute of Hotel Management (IHM), Sector 42, Chandigarh.My Chandigarh connect: I studied hotel management in the city and was a student here from 1997 to 2000 when I graduated. Over the last few years, my work has brought me to the city often.My area of expertise: Having worked with some of the leading hotel chains like the Taj Group of Hotels and The Leela group, I specialise in Indian cuisines and, in recent years, in food research. I am also a passionate photographer and gardener.My secret to success: There are many things that make a person successful and there are a lot of people involved in ones journey. It starts as early as school and college with our teachers. So has been the case with me, but when I look back I think my travels in India and around the world have really been key to my success as a chef. Travel helped me embrace not just all kinds of food but also different people and cultures.The turning point: For me, the turning point came when I actually started loving what I do. Let me explain why I say this. Initially, my life was very hectic. I would work long hours and weekends. At that point, I started comparing myself with people who would have weekends off or had more time on their hands. Then one day I accepted that this was how it was going to be. The day I accepted it, things changed. I started to enjoy what I do.What I owe to Chandigarh: My stay in Chandigarh was my first time away from home. My parents were initially very apprehensive. But when I came here, I didnt feel out of place. I saw how people bonded with each other. Every festival  be it Lohri, Diwali, Holi  it would be a community affair. I imbibed this community spirit. Chandigarh helped me hone my tastebuds, especially when it came to kebabs and curries. As young students we survived on humble meals that cost as little as Rs 10 and this included unlimited rotis. It taught me humility. I also learnt to appreciate the simplicity of meals and the essence of Punjabi khaana (food) here.Things I like to do when I visit Chandigarh: I always look forward to eating out when I am here. As students, our favourite haunt was the Sector 34 market. I remember a small little takeaway joint here called Chaplin. I love visiting the place when I am in Chandigarh. It brings back memories of college days. We relished all meals here including the speciality - tomato paneer. The owner knew we lived on a budget and would always give a little extra portion, including complimentary salad. I have been hooked to the place ever since my first year of college.How has the city changed over the years: I think not just cities but people change as well. Its progression. I think over the years, I have become better and my Institute has become better too. But I must say I hate how the roundabouts now have traffic signals. I still love Sukhna Lake even though it is overcrowded. I think the city has evolved but maintained an old world charm.The change I would want to see in the city: I come from Delhi and over there I see a disconnect between people and those who run it. I want the residents of Chandigarh and the people who manage it to have a better bonding. I feel it is important for a city to move forward together. I would like Chandigarh to maintain its identity and be a better city not just with regard to infrastructure but in arts as well. I remember reading how Le Corbusier emphasised art and I think efforts should be made to keep it alive.The secret of success in the hospitality industry: I always tell people who are keen about a career in hospitality or are pursuing hotel management to laugh out loud and sometimes laugh at yourself. It is a very stressful environment to work in. Its equally important to put your head down and learn. Youngsters shouldnt worry about the money. It is more important to get the skill right, the money will follow."

Divyas journey into baking and satisfying the sweet tooth of Chennaiites began as a hobby after becoming a mother. We were in Goa. After I had my daughter, I wasnt doing much apart from taking care of her. There was a bread bakery next door and that got me interested in baking, she recalls. Eventually, she began baking breads.Gradually she started making drool-worthy cakes, pastries, quiches and pies. Initially, I was into bread baking. From garlic to milk bread, I used to do it all, she beams. Her biggest breakthrough was when her baked goodies were sold in Sandys, and Ox and Tomato, two famous restaurants in the city. Until then I was baking only for my family and close friends. After my bakes made it to the shelves of two popular restaurants in the city, I began getting orders from people who had become fans of my dishes, she says.The textile designer specialises in wedding cakes, French macrons, and hand-frosted /hand-painted cookies and cakes. I am a self-taught baker...I learnt it all by trial and error. About five years back, there werent many people in Chennai who made French macrons.

They are unique, says shares.Youd think that her inspiration would be an A-list pastry chef. But, Divya says that her inspiration is her mother. She used to make amazing fish pies and I was inspired by that, says Divya, who has followed her mothers footsteps, when it comes making delicious savoury pies. My family prefers my savoury bakes over my sweet ones. Especially the pork and mushroom pie, she says. She grew up in Coonoor, amid tea estates and cottage houses in the Nilgiri hills. She dreams of opening a cottage style caf, outside Chennai, as a reminiscent of her childhood. My childhood was about roaming around in our tea estate, having a beautiful view of the cottages in Coonoor and eating in small time cafes.

He had already spent Rs 50,000 in preparing his two acre field and now it was becoming difficult to recover the input cost.Balchandra Bhagat, a resident of Dobi said every year his family earned from cultivating tomatoes, but this year it had been a total loss.Rakesh said Sehore had made a name for itself in tomato cultivation and its produce was exported up to Delhi in North and down south to Hyderabad and last year the farmers of this area had earned up to Rs 1.25 lakh per acre by selling tomatoes on an average as a result of which a large number of farmers decided to plant it this season too.Commissioner and director horticulture Satyanand said tomatoes were multiple harvest crop and most of the farmers had sold a portion of their produce when prices were high.This is the fag end of the season and there is the final burst of production for which prices must have crashed, the commissioner said saying that he personally had not heard of farmers throwing tomatoes on the road."

(Express photo by Prashant Nadkar/Representational) Exactly a year ago, farmers across the state had gone on a similar strike that had crippled essential supplies. (Express photo by Prashant Nadkar/Representational)Farmers in Maharashtra are gearing up for a fresh round of protests, with a number of groups giving a call for strike in June. Exactly a year ago, farmers across the state had gone on a similar strike that had crippled essential supplies. Vegetables and fruits were stopped from reaching the urban centres while dairies complained of dip in collection as farmers refused to supply milk.After several rounds of discussions with the protesting farmers, the state government had finally agreed to some of their demands, following which the strike was called off. One of the immediate impacts of last years strike was the announcement of Rs 34,000-crore loan waiver in the form of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Samman Yojana. The procurement price of milk was increased to Rs 27 per litre, while, in response to the demand for implementation of the M S Swaminathan Commission report that had recommended that farmers receive at least 1.5 times their production costs, a special commission was announced to ensure that farmers get decent returns for their produce.ALSO READ | Farmer suicides in BJP-ruled states very low, mostly over personal issues: Amit Shah in KarnatakaBut within a year, farmers are ready to start an agitation once again. A group claiming to have the support of more than 30 organisations has called for a farmers strike from June 1. Here are some of the issues that have led to the farmers agitation.Loan waiverThe loan waiver announced by the state government was supposed to wipe off outstanding loans of farmers since 2009. This was the second loan waiver in the state, the previous one having been implemented by the Congress-NCP government in 2007-08. The scheme has been facing teething problems right from the start, mainly on account of over-reliance on technology.To submit their claims for loan waiver, farmers had been asked to fill up online forms, which was to be authenticated by cooperative department using similar data entered by the banks. Technical glitches, and the dependence of many farmers on local officials to fill up these forms, have led to delays in the process. The government had announced that loans worth Rs 23102.19 crore in 46.34 lakh farm loan accounts would be waived. Till March 6 this year, banks have been able to complete this process only for 35.68 lakh accounts, worth a total of Rs 13,782 crore.The delays in completion of loan waiver scheme has impacted disbursement of fresh farm loans for the current season. A number of ineligible farmers had defaulted on their loans, hoping their loans would also be waived off. Because of their defaults, they are finding it difficult to obtain fresh loans.There has been an almost 40 per cent drop in crop loan disbursement for this season, and a 28 per cent rise in lending by money lenders. What is likely to further delay the loan waiver scheme is the state governments acceptance of the demand of tribal farmers who had marched to Mumbai last month to extend the cut-off date of loans to 2001.PricesThe biggest worry of the farmers right now is the low prices their produce is fetching in the market. Barring soyabean, whose season is long over, not a single commodity is trading at government-specified Minimum Support Price (MSP). In the case of perishables like fruits and vegetables, the situation is worse. Rabi tomato, which sells at the rate of Rs 10 a kg, is now trading at Rs 1-2 per kg at the markets of Narayangaon and Junnar. Onions, which till recently were fetching Rs 20 a kg at wholesale markets, are now priced at Rs 6 a kg. Farmer leader and Swabhimani Paksha MP Raju Shetti says the present price slump is the worst he has seen in the last 20 years.ALSO READ | MSP Satyagrah: No mandi where farmers can sell their produce at MSP, says Yogendra YadavThe reasons for low prices are several. In case of important rabi crop like chana, the held over stock of the last two years, and a lack of market confidence, has brought about the slide. A crop like tur, which has reported lower sowing than last year, is also trading over Rs 1,200 per quintal below its MSP as the state tries to deal with the held-over stock. In fact, it is estimated that that farmers in the state have lost over Rs 1,067 crore by selling tur below MSP this season.Government procurement, often the panacea for low prices, has not helped much.Milk and sugarcaneLast year, the government had increased the procurement price of milk from Rs 24 to Rs 27 per litre. Dairies are, however, barely able to pay Rs 20 per litre to farmers owing to a glut of milk powder in the market. Sugar prices are on a steady fall which has made mills default in their payment. There are over Rs 2,200 crore in dues by the mills to cane farmers.The result has been that farmers are staring at another debt trap. With no immediate relief expected from the market, and government interventions inadequate, the farmers find themselves with no option but to start a fresh agitation. Their demands are no different from the last time  assured returns on their produce and a full loan waiver. So close to an election year, they hope to force the government to listen to their demands.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

At the entrance, the modest gallery is filled with hushed gasps. Its a sombre room full of words and photos on the massacre. The lines Its a tragedy of national importance that cannot be allowed to be forgotten jump at you from one wall as a girl asks her mother, How could they shoot without warning?Next-door, Sukumar Mukherjee, bright in a yellow T-shirt, sits under the impassive gaze of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. A neat row of photos, mostly black and white, line the four walls. For Mukherjee, secretary of the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust, this is both home and office  his residence is a short flight upstairs.MAKING OF A MEMORIAL The Jallianwala Bagh was owned by Himmat Singh, a noble in the court of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, who hailed from Jalla village near Fatehgarh Sahib.Area: 6.5 acre (26,000 m2)Resolution for buying the Jallianwala Bagh: 1919Funds collected: Rs 5,60,472Bagh acquired on: 1 August 1920Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust set up: 1 May 1951Flame of liberty cost: Rs 9.25 lakhDesigned by: American Benjamin PolkMemorial inaugurated on: 13 April 1961, by President Dr Rajendra Prasad in the presence of PM Jawaharlal Nehru.Members of the memorial trust: PM is the chairman, and permanent members include the Congress president, Punjab CM, governor, Union culture minister and leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha.Also Read | Part 2: Revisiting Jallianwala 100 years on: The horrible General DyerThe Bangla connectionThe 64-year-old with green eyes was born here, like his father Uttam Charan. The Mukherjees from the Hooghly district of West Bengal have been the caretakers of the Jallianwala memorial from its birth. Sukumars grandfather Sashti Charan Mukherjee, a homeopath practising in Allahabad, was deputed by Congress leader Madan Mohan Malviya to arrange a session in Amritsar in 1910. He never went back. Present at the bagh on the day of the 1919 massacre, Sashti Charan escaped death by hiding under the dais, and later moved a resolution for acquiring the bagh at the Congress session in Amritsar. This was followed by a nationwide appeal for fundraising by Mahatma Gandhi and a trust was set up with Malviya as president and Sashti Charan as secretary. The British, it is said, wanted to obliterate the signs of the massacre by setting up a cloth market here but the Indians managed to acquire the land in 1920. Miffed, the authorities arrested Sashti Charan, who had the land deed, but he remained resolute.IN DISREPAIR The concrete staircase is slowly cracking open. Even the adjacent building, acquired in 2011 as it carried the bullet marks, is beginning to crumble. God forbid there is even minor quake, the entire structure will come crashing down, says a local.A few years ago, an expert committee estimated that the repairs will take around Rs 22 lakh. The sum was sanctioned by former PM Manmohan Singh, but it is yet to reach the trust. Namita Jaspal, a heritage conservator, who has been visiting the bagh frequently, says it needs a lot of work. The buildings are made of Nankshahi bricks, they must be strengthened without disturbing their original character. The gallery too needs an upgrade, its important to showcase original documents and photos in a way that they dont disintegrate.In the past, the trust enjoyed direct access to the Prime Minister, but now all requests are routed through the ministry of culture.The trust is running its salary account on the rent from a Punjab National Bank office, a part of the property, but there are little funds for maintenance, leave alone conservation. The light-and-sound show, for instance, is lying unused for want of repair. Outside the bagh, former Hall Bazaar councillor Sunil Sharma Konti, claims the memorial is facing neglect because of the perception that it is associated with the Congress.Well wishers feel a nominal entry fees of even Rs 1 can make the bagh self-sustainable as it receives around 50,000 visitors a day. This proposal was strongly supported by BJP doyen LK Advani, but nothing came out of it.Ever since, the Mukherjees have been the caretakers of the memorial. Sukumar, the youngest of three brothers, quit his bank job to take up the mantle from his father Upendra Narayan when he died in 1988. I was appointed by then PM Rajiv Gandhi, says Sukumar. The bagh has seen a lot of development, he says, but people no longer accord it the respect it deserves. Most visitors treat it as a picnic spot, sometimes they dont even care to read its history, sighs Sukumar, who has seen a long march of VVIPs at the tall pink obelisk, called the flame of liberty.Also Read | Part 1: Bloodbath on Baisakhi, the massacre that shook the British RajA memorable journeyThough the trust is headed by the prime minister himself, managing the memorial is no cakewalk. In 2011, Sukumar had goons following him when the Punjab and Haryana high court ordered an illegal occupant of a neighbouring building acquired by the trust to vacate it. Sukumar laughs as he recounts how the cops ran away and left him to fend for himself in the middle of the eviction process.A few years ago, when the Indian Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) decided to set up a control room for a light-and-sound show on the massacre, someone spread a rumour that they were planning a mujra. Members of the Bhagat Singh Naujawan Sabha got together and damaged the stage and speakers. It took us one year to get the project back on track. During militancy, a group of youngsters with swords threatened to kill his father, saying they had seen people smoking in the bagh. Papaji was very gutsy, he said, kill me and they left.Former President Dr Rajendra Prasad, ex-PM Jawaharlal Nehru, then CM of Punjab Partap Singh Kairon at the inauguration of the Jallianwala Bagh Memorial Trust on April 13, 1961. (HT photo)Complaints, howsoever frivolous, are commonplace. Last fortnight, the Punjab State Human Rights Commission shot off a notice to the trust, asking it to explain why the Sulabh Shauchalya on the premises was charging Rs 2 from women. Someone must have complained to them; but this is a charge imposed by the company, how do I explain it, Mukherjee wonders.A life less ordinaryLiving with a piece of history has its challenges. Kakali, Sukumars bubbly wife who came here as a young bride in the 1980s when militancy had gripped the state, remembers the siege during Op Bluestar. We couldnt step out for over a week, thankfully papaji (Upendra Narayan) had a habit of storing ration. It was due to the barter of onions and tomatoes that she came close to her neighbours during that period.The galiara project for the beautification of the space around the Golden Temple has compounded the number of visitors to the bagh. We have a free 24-hour light and sound show, says Kakali. With the Golden Temple on one side and a small mosque on the other, they are treated to both gurbani and the call of the muezzin. I enjoy the kirtan, it very soothing, says Kakoli, who has learnt to speak and read Punjabi.Lack of privacy is the first casualty of living here but the couple dont mention it. What Kakali does broach is lack of normal domestic life. Weve never had a weekend, those are reserved for VIP visits, she laughs as Sukumar tells you how hes never celebrated the birthday of his elder daughter Proshita as it coincides with the hanging of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.Sukumars two brothers have moved back to Kolkata, his three sisters too have married and left. After the couples two daughters Proshita, a banker, and Shreya, a designer, moved out due to jobs, Kakali has been dividing her time between Kolkota and Amritsar. Often, Sukumar is left alone with his 90-year-old ailing mother, who introduced Durga Puja to the holy city.My daughters worry about my health and tell me Papa, youve done enough sewa, come stay with us, but I want to see the memorial through its 100th anniversary. Then, I will see, sighs Sukumar.His eyes liquid, Sukumar is clear: I cant turn my back on this place. Its seeped by the blood of so many. I cant let them down.Read Part 4 here"

Year after year, we are struggling against falling market prices, vagaries of climate, an apathetic government and indebtedness. Farming is all that I know but it is no longer viable. I will put up a shop, sell tea or lease out my land, but I wont farm anymore, said Khandbahale, who owns three acres of land.In June last year, Khandbahale was one of the thousands of farmers in Maharashtra who took to the streets to protest against the agrarian crisis the state is battling. One of the central demands of the protesters was a complete loan waiver.As supply of vegetables and milk to the cities stopped, the two-day strike forced chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to announce a farm loan waiver worth Rs 34,000 crore, a demand he had resisted since 2014.Less than a year after the strike and the waiver  up to Rs 1.50 lakh per family  farmers remain unimpressed. In Nasik and Ahmednagar districts, which bore the brunt of the protests, farmers say the waiver hasnt helped ease their struggle.Bowing to pressure The Maharashtra govt announced a loan waiver last June. Farmers say it hasnt helped ease their struggle so far Rs 34,000 cr farm loan waiver was announced by the state government after protests by farmers in June 2017 Rs 1.5 lakh per family cap has been put on the loan waiver. This includes principal and interest amount, crop loans as well as mid-term loans from 2009 to June 2016 The scheme had three components  besides the Rs 1.5 lakh waiver, it offered a one-time settlement option for those whose loans were farm loan waiver was announced by the state government after protests by farmers in June 2017per family cap has been put on the loan waiver.

Out of these, 3.038 million have applied for a full waiver and remaining for the incentive cash amount. Another Rs 10,000 crore has been budgeted for the waiver.Khandbahale owes Rs 8.5 lakh to a bank in Nasik. He can benefit from the Rs 1.5 lakh waiver only after he pays the remaining amount he owes. I dont have Rs 7 lakh in hand, why would I keep incurring more debt if I had the money? I may have to sell off some of my land to make that last payment to the bank. We dont need waivers. We can repay our loans if we get assured prices for our produce, he said.In Putamba village of Ahmednagar district, ground zero of the last years strike, farmers remain disaffected.The loan waiver helps banks more than us. So, the government should stop pretending they have done something big for farmers. If they want to help, then they should increase minimum support prices (MSP), procure the produce from us, said Salim Shaikh, an onion farmer from the village, who may not be able to take advantage of the waiver. This year, his income from soyabean and onion has been minimal. He owes a nationalised bank Rs 3.5 lakh he borrowed as a mid-term loan and Rs 2 lakh as a crop loanThe governments list of beneficiaries shows Maharashtra has 1 million farmers like Khandbahale and Shaikh who owe more than Rs 1.50 lakh to banks. Such farmers have been offered a one-time settlement (OTS)pay off the remaining amount to the bank and get a Rs 1.50 lakh waiver. Not many farmers are in a position to take up this offer.Shaikhs neighbour Rajendra Dhakchaule, a marginal farmer with just two acres of cultivable land, can repay most of his Rs 1.70 lakh debt with the waiver. But his worries dont end with this.I had taken a loan of Rs 3.5 lakh for a tractor and under pressure collected money from a money lender to pay off this loan. I may get some respite due to the loan waiver but thats fleeting help. The ground situation for farmers like me is unsustainable, he says, breaking down.This year, the Dhakchaules spent Rs 56,000 to cultivate onion over an acre of land, but the family of six may not recover even the cultivation costs as onion prices have dropped to Rs 700 per quintal from Rs 3000 per quintal this January. This is an eight-month low for onions.In neighbouring Pimpalgaon village, Vijay Waghchowre, a marginal farmer who owns four acres of land, is still waiting for confirmation of the waiver from his bank.The waiver may help us marginally this year. But I still owe another Rs 2 lakh to a moneylender. If the government wants to help farmers, let it give us subsidies or offer assured prices for our produce.The BJP-led state government is counting on the goodwill of marginal farmers like Dhakchaule to help it tide over the rural discontent.The directives of the chief minister were to ensure a system whereby the loan waiver would be transparent, inclusive and swift. We were careful to learn from the mistakes of the past loan waiver, said Kaustubh Dhavse, officer on special duty at the chief ministers office, who was involved in devising the online system for the loan waiver. There had been connivance at the level of banks, government and farmers earlier to give benefits to ineligible farmers. In our case, there is no room for such connivance because the online system does not allow for it. The waiver has offered benefit to maximum genuine farmers.Goodwill for the government isnt visible on the ground.A section of farmers leaders is continuing protests for a complete loan waiver. This month, as nearly 30,000 largely tribal cultivators marched from Nasik to Mumbai, the leaders put the demand back on their agenda. This was despite a majority of the protestors demanding their rights over forest lands and not a waiver as they have no access to banks.As a temporary relief to farmers to overcome the current distress, a complete loan waiver is essential. Thats why we continue to flag it whenever possible. A hike in MSP is one of our main demands and the state has failed to deliver on that too, said Ajit Navale, general secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha, involved in both the farmers protests.The loan waiver has a limited scope. Consider this, the total crop loan debt on the states farmers is Rs 1.13 lakh crore; the government so far has spent only Rs 13,580 crore on the loan waiver, he said."

Whatever could be salvaged after his emotional outburst, he placed in a heap and put up a sign: Take farm produce for free.That was barely a week after another farmer in Jalna, Premising Chavan, was videographed taking a hoe to a healthy cauliflower field. Days after the video of the apoplectic Chavan destroying his crop was shared widely on WhatsApp, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray met him in Mumbai and handed over aid offered by a private organisation. Cauliflower prices were hovering around Rs 500 a quintal. Its not possible to even cover cost of cultivation and harvest and transport at such prices, Bochate told The Indian Express over the phone. Being able to afford my two boys school fees is increasingly difficult.Instances of farmers dumping their produce on roadsides, witnessed across the country in the aftermath of demonetisation, appear to have returned to Maharashtras countryside as vegetable prices plummet. Days after nearly 40,000 tribals, other farmers and farm labourers marched from Nashik to Mumbai last month, some farmers in northern Nashik dumped tomatoes on the roadside. Prices that week dipped to Rs 200 a quintal in Nashik.Shriram Gadhave, president of the Narayangaon-based Vegetable Growers Association of India, said vegetable prices will remain depressed through the coming summer owing to increased farm area under vegetables. The rains were good, and the water table has improved, so many farmers go in for vegetables expecting good prices in the summer season, he said.Until four or five years back, the pockets around Narayangaon and Nashik used to supply a large percentage of the states tomatoes, he said. But now production is coming in from all corners of the state. Whether its Aurangabad or Beed or elsewhere, local tomatoes are now available in plenty.The promise of better access to processing industries has not borne fruit for vegetable farmers  the capacity of processing industries is barely 2 to 3 per cent of the crop, according to Gadhave. Bochate, who used to drive a Bolero that he purchased with a loan, sold the vehicle two years back to focus on farming.I used to grow soybean before. After I sold the Bolero I repaid the loan and dug a borewell on my land. There was plenty of water, so I was expecting Rs 3 lakh from my tomatoes and brinjal this season, he said. Instead, he was offered Rs 25 per 20-kg crate  that wouldnt cover even the auto ride to the market and the cost of cultivation and harvest.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

I used to bring home different plant cuttings for my garden. She finds it a natural way to relax.Jyoti started working on her present patch of green from 2014. Over these three years, she has developed ground and terrace gardens, in which she has plants that are healthy for consumption. She chooses to do organic gardening.The garden has a variety of fruits such as mulberry, papaya, coconut and mosambi. Vegetables include cauliflower, tomato, cabbage and chilies. She says that the produce is sufficient for her family, and she rarely visits the market.Jyothi also takes a keen interest in exotic plant varieties such as lotus and lilies. She makes her own compost from kitchen waste and, every two months, she gets around eight sacks of compost.She says, Adding chemicals to the soil is harmful to it. Organic gardening begins with attention to the soil. You regularly add organic matter to the soil, using locally available resources wherever possible. And everyone has access to the raw ingredients of organic matter, because your lawn, garden and kitchen produce them every day. Decaying plant wastes, such as grass clippings, fall leaves and vegetable scraps from your kitchen, are the building blocks of compost, the ideal organic matter for your garden soil. If you add compost to your soil, youre already on your way to raising a beautiful, healthy garden.Talking about organic gardening, she says, When you garden organically, you think of your plants as part of a whole system within nature that starts in the soil and includes the water supply, people, wildlife and even insects. An organic gardener strives to work in harmony with natural systems and to minimise and continually replenish any resources the garden consumes. Jyothi, who volunteers at an NGO that works for the betterment of farmers, promotes the practice of organic gardening in her neighbourhood.Jyothi says pest control is necessary. She adds, Removing disease-infected leaves or plants, rotating crops so you are not growing the same type in the same spot year after year, and handpicking insect pests and eggs all help to suppress pest populations. She uses tulsi as a natural way of preventing pests.Jyoti along with her domestic helps invests around two hours in the morning and evening to water the plants and take care of the garden."

We generally do well at home, but our away record hasn't been good. We should try to get teams from 16 to 8 (AFC rankings) ranking. It's difficult to play South Korea and Japan as they don't want to play us. We should get teams who are better than us and play at their home. This is from the organisation side,"" Chhetri told IANS in an interview here.""From the players' side, we need to improve ourselves individually, making sure that the competition for the national team increases and it is a big headache for the coach. It should be tough for him to choose the players and whenever that happens he gets the cream,"" the 33-year-old said.India qualified for the Asian Cup by beating Macau in the qualifiers last year in October.The last time India played in the world's second-oldest continental football championship was in 2011 under British coach Bob Houghton. Chhetri was an integral part of the team, scoring two goals in the group stages in what was only India's third appearance.India did not win a match and bowed out, letting in 13 goals and scoring just three.Chhetri said India should look to play teams like the United Arab Emirates (UAE), who are also hosting the Asian Cup, on the road.Indian football team captain Sunil Chhetri (EPS | Vinod Kumar)""We are at the bottom, man. Whoever we get is going to be better than us,"" Chhetri said when asked to name the teams they should play friendlies with leading up to the tournament, starting in January next year.""In 2011, we got No 1, No 3 and No 5 -- Australia, South Korea, Bahrain (in the main round). It couldn't have been worse than that mathematically. This time we got Kyrgyzstan, Macau and Myanmar (in the qualifiers). With due respect to them it wasn't very difficult.""We should aim to play the UAE, Qatar, Oman, Palestine and Lebanon (in the friendlies),"" Chhetri said.There are talks of a four-nation Champions Cup taking place this year in India. Chhetri said the tourney would have no bearing on India's rankings as it is outside the FIFA dates, but the match practice would do a world of good to India's preparations.""Now it's not about the rankings, because we have qualified. Having said that, the arrangements of the groups matter in terms of ranking but keeping all these things aside, playing at home those three-four nation tournament...I hope we get better teams to play against,"" he said.Chhetri in Bengaluru FC training colours (Twitter/Indian Super League)Coming to his club Bengaluru FC, which is at the top of the ISL standings now, Chhetri said it doesn't have the pressure of expectations and takes one game at a time.""The motto in our club is to think about the next game -- the way we won two Federation Cups and the I-League by taking one game at a time. The motto has not changed,"" he said.Just married to long-time girlfriend Sonam, daughter of former India and Mohun Bagan defender Subrata Bhattacharya, Chhetri signed off tongue-in-cheek, saying he now knows the prices of ""onions and tomatoes"".""The last 10-15 days after marriage... I have enjoyed my time. I think me and Sonam have seen each other for 13 years but we never lived with each other. She was always a tourist wherever I played. Now living together, it's nice, man. More because, apart from the fact that she is my wife and I love her... we are also very good friends,"" he said.""She understands my job. So there was no need of telling her that I have to come back and sleep and take a nap... everything is nice because she understands. Later in the evening we watch Netflix. We go for walks. We went to buy grocery the other day and I realised I haven't taken walks for a long time. I know the rates of onions and tomatoes now (laughs)."""

So far, 20 centres of excellence are functioning in different states under the Indo-Israeli Agriculture Project and five more will be operational by next month. Photo: Israel EmbassyNew Delhi: India and Israel are set to jointly develop new crop varieties and share post harvest technologies following the success of the 10-year-old Indo-Israeli Agriculture Project (IIAP) whose accomplishments include growing cherry tomatoes in Haryana, rejuvenating mango orchards in Maharashtra and demonstrating to Indian farmers the effectiveness of state-of-the-art irrigation technologies.For a country like Israel where 60% of the area is desert, exporting high-value farm produce like mangoes and avocados is a matter of pride, whereas for India, among the largest food producers globally, the challenge is to counter the effects of erratic rainfall, raise productivity and use water efficiently.So, it was with the objective of sharing best practices and technical knowledge from Israel that the agriculture cooperation project was launched in 2008. The implementing partners for the project are the National Horticulture Mission (NHM) under the agriculture ministry, MASHAV, Israels agency for international development cooperation, and Indian state governments which help set up centres of excellence as per their local needs.Our goal is to help the Indian farmer by exposing them to new technologies tailored to their local needs, said Dan Alluf, counsellor of science and agriculture at MASHAV, Delhi.There is a lot of focus on drip irrigation and how to design better farms by using canopy management and use of improved irrigation and fertigation technologies, Alluf said, adding, Each centre showcases a range of greenhouses to farmers depending on their needs and capabilities. A unique focus is to teach farmers the language of irrigation - when to irrigate and by how much - to increase water use efficiency.So far, 20 centres of excellence are functioning in different states and five more will be operational by next month. Notable among these are centres for vegetables in Karnal, Haryana, for mangoes in Dapoli and for citrus fruits in Nagpur, both in Maharashtra, and one for pomegranates in Bassi, Rajasthan.Among the unique projects are a functional centre of excellence for bee-keeping in Haryana and a centre for dairy which is in the pipeline.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit to Israel in July last year, a new action plan for the years 2018-2020 envisages joint development of new crop varieties and sharing of post harvest technologies.Further, the plan is to establish a partnership on water conservation that includes waste-water treatment and its reuse for agriculture, desalination, water utility reforms, and the cleaning of the Ganga and other rivers using advanced water technologies.According to a MASHAV document, vegetable intervention in Haryana showed how crop productivity could be increased 5-10 times under protected cultivation of tomato, capsicum and cucumber, coupled with 65% decrease in water use and substantial reduction in fertiliser and pesticide costs.Similarly, the mango orchard rejuvenation project in Dapoli resulted in a three-fold rise in productivity within three years.Every year, between 10,000 and 20,000 farmers visit each of these centres, and we hope the technologies we are showcasing will echo, carried forward by state governments and the private sector, said Alluf.One of the key ways to boost overall agricultural production is to implement better soil-water management techniques that would provide the arid and semi-arid lands better access to irrigation water, without actually increasing the stress on available water resources, said a NITI Aayog concept paper released in October last year.However, data from the report showed that out of 160 million hectares of cultivable land in India, only about 65 million hectares or 41% is covered under irrigation. Also, just 8.6 million hectares are currently covered under micro-irrigation compared to a potential 69.5 million hectares.In states which are water-stressed such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Gujarat, adoption of drip irrigation has been faster but so far, adoption of these technologies among north Indian farmers has been lower due to easy water availability, said Siraj Hussain, former agriculture secretary and currently a fellow at the Delhi-based Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.The centre and state governments also need to push these technologies with more funding. Last years budget announced a Rs5,000 crore micro-irrigation fund, but it took almost a year to operationalise it, Hussain added."

Onion prices have recorded a correction at a time when the central government has announced a special initiative for the crop along with tomato and potato.Onion prices have dipped again in the wholesale markets with the bulb trading below Rs 1,000 per quintal. A bumper crop in Maharashtra as well as early arrival of rabi onions in the wholesale markets of states like Gujarat and Rajasthan led to a steep price correction which traders say is likely to remain for the rest of the season. On Wednesday, the average price of onions at Lasalagon wholesale market in Nashik was Rs 788 per quintal  one third of the price it fetched in January. Onion prices have been showing a downward trend since the beginning of March. In most wholesale markets, average traded price was below Rs 1,000 per quintal.This is in sharp contrast to the price trend a few weeks back when prices were hovering between Rs 1,500-2,000 per quintal. Prices had crossed the Rs 3,000 mark in November, December and January which spiked the prices in the retail markets as well. The eight-month bull run, farmers had said, had come after almost a 15 month slump which saw farmers selling onions at throw away prices of Rs 300-5,00 quintals. The price slump is due a bumper summer or rabi crop which has started arriving in the markets. Maharashtra has reported around 3.5 lakh hectares under summer onion this year as against the 3 lakh hectares last year. Also onion crop area has increased in neighbouring states of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. Maharashtra accounts for almost 60 per cent of the summer crop.Farmers normally store their produce in moisture and heat proof structures called Kanda chawl to dispose them of later in the season. Rabi onions normally feed the market from March till the arrival of the new kharif crop later in September.Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of Lasalgaons wholesale market, said that the bumper arrivals have brought down prices. Arrival is huge and thus prices have come down. We fear prices might go down further in view of the good crop expected, he said.Onion prices have recorded a correction at a time when the central government has announced a special initiative for the crop along with tomato and potato. Under Operation Green, the government wishes to re-construct the success in the dairy sector under Operation Flood. However, as prices come down, traders say exports have also taken a hit despite nil minimum export price (MEP). There is no demand from the outside markets, said Jagdish Apshunde, an exporter at Nashiks wholesale market. Till November last year, the country had recorded 17,72, 254.31 quintals of onion export.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

He believes that the taste of North East is still not widely known. Das says The cuisine from north eastern states are surprisingly different from one another. While Sikkim and Arunachal have Tibetan and Nepalese influence; Meghalay, Tripura and Assam have some characteristics of food from East Bengal. Manipuri food has good vegetarian options, he says.Mediterranean food is hot now, believes Vinesh Gupta, general manager, The Den Bengaluru. He says, The Mediterranean-inspired dishes are packed with flavour  especially smoky, spicy notes made with fresh, clean, better-for-your ingredients. They dont require meat to take a starring role, which is perfect for the growing number of consumers opting for vegetarian meals.Interaction between the chef and customer is also a trend that is fast catching up. Chef Vikas Seth, Culinary Director at Embassy Leisure, Sanchez & Sriracha says, Several dishes are now made live at tables and the concept of chefs table is also becoming very popular.He also points to the proliferation of new cuisines from across the world due to interest of well-travelled customers.Technology is prerequisite, even in food industry. Chef Sanjeev Kapoor predicts, We will see several new food ventures in the digital space in terms of social media, gadgets, apps and more.Beer and CocktailsLets get old-fashionedCocktails with fancy names at a bar will take a back seat this year. Hemant Mundkur, brand ambassador of Diageo India, believes that there is going to be a rise in cocktails preparations at home, hosting friends the old fashioned way. He also predicts that Scotch whisky will find its way into cocktails this year.Abhishek Bindal, AVP, operations, KA Hospitality, talks about a very interesting liquid trend  Barrel aged cocktails. He explains This trend involves putting pre-mixed drinks into barrels for a few weeks in order to enhance the flavour, texture and complexity of the cocktail following the same ideology behind whiskey, wine and other traditional spirits.He adds that most people in Bengaluru prefer their Gin & Tonic. This pattern will continue but people will look at more evolved G&T cocktails and will be open to experimenting more with the flavours and types of gin.Sour beer in your mugChef Yogen DattaJohn Eapen, a city-based brewery consultant talks about the big beer trends that will rule the roost in the city this year. He says, Bengaluru has a mature craft beer audience. People travelling abroad are trying a broad spectrum of craft beer styles. Bitter styles such as Pale Ales and IPAs (India Pale Ales) are slowly gaining momentum and catching up with Wheat Beers. Expect more Sour Beers in 2018.He adds consumers have started appreciating craft beer helping drive consumption. Outlets in city do anywhere from 10,000-20,000 liters every month. Bengalurus craft beer standards (batch quality/consistency) are also some of the highest in the country, he says.Matcha Fever to continueA meal is never complete without a dessert. Chef Yogen bats for pairing of unusual flavours in desserts. He says Green apple and cucumber with single origin chocolate to create a light chocolate dessert is a fine example of the food pairing in desserts. Juxtaposing ingredients which are seemingly not alike, is helping chefs create new sensations.The Matcha fever took over India last year and many restaurants have now come up with their own versions. Talking about this popular trend, Chef Yogen says This flavour is unique and is a departure from the sweet, floral and fruity flavours, desserts are usually associated with. However, Abhishek credits the health benefits of Matcha for its rising popularity. He says, With 10 times the antioxidants of regular green tea, Matcha graduated from simply being used as just a tea to being sold in health-food stores as a superfood ingredient for use in baking and desserts.Chef Abhijit Saha, Founder, Director and Chef  Avant Garde Hospitality concludes with a very unusual dessert trend for 2018. He predicts This year will see a surge in introduction of salts in desserts. A lot of usage of spices and herbs in desserts will be seen, along with unusual items such as tomatoes, olives and olive oil."

The years are breathing down the neck of Kidambi Srikanth. Saina Nehwal voiced her intent to try becoming the first Indian woman to win the prestigious crown while PV Sindhu has looked the likeliest to win it for some time. The years are breathing down the neck of Kidambi Srikanth.Indian badminton has been a scroll of happy headlines for the last 10 years since Saina Nehwal scored her first upset win at the Beijing Olympics. Success at the Super Series, the World Championships and the Olympics has added layers to its history, as a flurry of names have cornered fame and remain in fine fettle to stake claim on any title. Yet, the best of the countrys shuttlers keep returning to the All England to reconnect with badmintons original moment of glory: the All England. In the coming week  and in years to come, indeed  Indias global stars are bound to race each other to the one title their coach Pullela Gopichand has, and they dont: the All England.Saina Nehwal began 2018 voicing her intent to try becoming the first Indian woman to win the prestigious crown. For some time now, PV Sindhu has looked the most likeliest to get herself into contention. The years are breathing down the neck of Indias biggest hope K Srikanth  its been 17 Marches now, since Gopichand last won. That had taken 20 years of waiting after Prakash Padukones big moment for Indian mens singles which turns 38 this spring. Both HS Prannoy and B Sai Praneeth will be acutely aware that this Super 1000 event  a $10,00,000 event  can catapult them ahead of every other shuttler in the countrys imagination. China and Indonesia Super 1000s  second tier after World Championship  bring in the same money, but All England is what sets hearts aflutter.Gopichand would be the first to know the enormity of the event. And hence, he will be the last person to remind his charges of the larger significance  and in turn pile on the pressure. Indians will head into Birmingham on Wednesday the same way they do at any other meet  looking at mid-week as the first of a hopeful five matches to come. The toughest throw of the dice has gone Saina Nehwals way. Yet, who else but the trailblazer, to embrace that stiff challenge.The rivalryNehwal starts against Chinese Taipeis Tai Tzu Ying. This is a saga worthy of a chapter of its own. The World No 1 vs Indias original superstar. The numbers have insidiously turned against Nehwal in the last 8 years  the Indian won the first 4 of their faceoffs, lost the next two before stamping down the talented opponent for a title at the Swiss Open in 2013, and then lost 7 in a row. Its not this notoreity of piled up losses though that makes this contest interesting. Saina (world No 11) vs Tai Tzu (world No 1) is anything but run-of-the-mill: it is in fact an opportunity for the Indian to hog headlines on Day 1. The surface of the courts at the Birmingham Arena is said to be harder than usual, and decisive footwork on this carpet that draws added effort out of the legs, remains key to beating Tai Tzu.Nehwal has worked specifically with coach Gopichand on quickening her movements against an opponent who is toughest to pre-empt with her variety in strokes. Just about the only solution is to be quick on the feet and hope that her anticipation antennae are specially alert if she wants to start chipping at the 5-9 head to head. Picking the Taiwanese girls strokes is half the job done, and Nehwal will have to back herself to not get blitzed away like happened at Indonesia two months ago. Nehwal would want to bring in her typical confidence that gets reinforced when her fitness is high and her movements precise.PV Sindhu can afford to look beyond the first round where she meets Chochuwong Pornpawee of Thailand. American Beiwen Zhang  the last woman to beat Sindhu a month ago, could be next, though she could find herself in a slugfest as early as quarters against Nozomi Okuhara. Sindhu too brought the All England in her radar vocalising her wish to win it in the run-up, and this will be the first of 2018s big events, where she would want to assert her ability to go for the titles, though Marin and Akane Yamaguchi are in the fourth seeds half of the draw to make life difficult.The draw has been wicked to the Chinese, with three clubbed into one quarter.Shuttle speeds permitting, Kidambi Srikanth ought to back himself to go deep into the tournament. He starts against Worlds giant killer Frenchman Brice Leverdez, and could be in a tricky quarter with HS Prannoy  who will need to beat higher ranked Chou Tien Chen and the plucky Indonesians. Chong Wei and Lin Dan will play out their skirmish of the ageing titans, before Srikanth gets a crack at them, but the country isnt one of the Indians happiest haunts.Three first round exits in 4 years mean Srikanth, aged 25, ranked 3, whos best performance was clearing the first round here, hasnt had the best of All Englands. But 2017 was a sensational year for Indias best mens singles player, and he cabn fancy his chances in a field that is depleted just a tad by the withdrawal of World No 1 Viktor Axelsen. Theres a slippery second round against Chinese Huang Yuxian (Srikanth lost to a first-time Chinese last year) or local hero Rajeev Ouseph. But should the stars align on five days, this could be Srikanths All England.Prannoy and Sai Praneeth are there to upset equations and trigger a ruckus in the draw  though Praneeth starts out against automaton  the defensive Son Wan Ho. The Indian is known for his impatience when botching matches, and itll be a mini-victory of sorts if he can clear the first hurdle against the Korean whose second nature is to induce ennui.Indias doubles pairings await a break-out performance, and will need to stay in contention till Friday, to corner attention amidst Indias strongest singles contingent. The doubles pairings are also battling the distraction of the new service rule that is being put into trial at All England.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

The model contract law, a copy of which has been reviewed by Hindustan Times, follows the Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2018.Conceived in the 1960s, APMC regulations require farmers to sell to licenced middlemen only in notified markets, usually in the same area as the farmer, rather than directly to buyers elsewhere.These rules were meant to protect farmers from being forced into distress selling. Over time, they have spawned layers of intermediaries, stretching the farm-to-fork supply chain. This results in a large price spread, meaning fragmentation of profit share because of the presence of too many middlemen.Usually, farmers get the lowest share of profit. APMCs have also become hubs for cartels that rig the system to offer lower prices to farmers while driving up prices for consumers. India has about 6,800 such public-sector markets.The revised Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2018, now set to be released to states, allows firms to sign advance contracts with farmers to grow a chosen crop or its specific variety with a buy-back assurance at an agreed price, giving cultivators a ready market without the oversight of the APMC system.A model law isnt presented in Parliament, but is instead sent to states for passage since the Centre cannot bring laws to regulate agriculture marketing, which falls in the states domain.To work around APMC markets, the budget for fiscal 2019 has also proposed to develop 22,000 new or existing private rural markets.The revised provisions of the model contract law state that businesses and farmers can enter into contracts for any crop, livestock breed or poultry of their choice. The earlier version, released for public scrutiny on January 23, restricted contract farming to only those crops that are allowed by states.The model law provides for dispute settlement at the level of the tehsil, or local administrative unit. It does away with an earlier provision that disputes could be taken for appeal to a decree court. Instead, the parties can escalate it to a three-member local authority, comprising an independent farmer, a corporate representative and a domain expert, all unrelated to the contracting parties. The law seeks to protect the farmers lands and their title. No business can build permanent structures on a farmers land or seize land. Registrations of contracts will be completely online, the model law says. The earlier version provided for physical contracts.Technological advancement with better agricultural practices makes contract farmers more technically and economically efficient, according to a 2016 post-doctoral study on contract farming in Punjab by Nivedita Sharma of the New Delhi-based Jawaharlal Nehru University.In most cases of contract farming, the sponsor, or the contracting firm, also directly provides most inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, as well as credit and technical skills to the farmers with whom it enters into a deal. This lowers the market risk for farmers.Several states did reform markets and gave direct marketing licences to various kinds of corporate buyers like Tata, Mahindra and Godrej, said R Ravikanth, an analyst with commodity trading firm Comtrade.We dont support contract farming because it is another form of exploitation. Why isnt there a provision that all produce will be contracted above minimum support prices? said Pema Ram, a leader of the All India Kisan Sabha.Most of these licences are not in use, Ravikanth added, because it is difficult to coordinate with a large number of small farmers. Current examples of contract farming include PepsiCo Inc. for tomato in Punjab, SABMiller Plc. for barley and McCain Foods Ltd for potato in Gujarat."

With the aim of alleviating farmer distress, the Centre included in the Union Budget an increase in the minimum support price for monsoon crops and pledged Rs 500 crore to Operation Greens, a programme to help farmers growing tomatoes, onions, and potatoes. Such measures will benefit farmers who own land, not those who dont.Data shows that 71% of Scheduled Caste farmers are what the census refers to as agricultural labourers  they work for wages on land they do not own. That figure is much lower among other groups: 47% for Scheduled Tribe farmers and 41% for non-SC/ST farmers. Data from the 70th round of Land and Livestock Holdings Survey of the NSSO indicates that 58.4% of rural Dalit households are landless -- a much higher proportion than households in any other social group. Landlessness is particularly severe among Dalits in states with a history of feudalism such as Haryana, Punjab and Bihar, where more than 85% of Dalit households do not own any land other than the plot they live on. More than 60% of Dalit households are landless in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Kerala, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and Odisha. The Socio Economic and Caste Census points out that landlessness and dependence on manual casual labour for a livelihood are key deprivations facing rural families, making them far more vulnerable to impoverishment.Apart from sporadic efforts, most notably in the Gandhian Bhoodan movement pioneered by Vinoba Bhave in Telangana in the 1950s and by Left governments in West Bengal and Kerala, and to some extent the National Conference government in Jammu and Kashmir, radical measures such as land distribution have not been taken.Of late, a newer generation of politicians has again voiced the demand for giving five acres of land to landless Dalit households as a means to resolve the crisis of rural livelihoods. It is not in agricultural alone that the Dalits have been short-changed. They are under-represented when it comes to jobs in the private sector and education. The States role in fighting this inequality is crucial. But with land holdings becoming even more fragmented  86% of the holdings in India are small and marginal, less than two hectares  it remains to be seen whether populist sops such as loan waivers, employment guarantee schemes and food security initiatives bring relief to small, marginalised farmers fighting landlessness, discrimination and poverty."

An Australian delegation visited the governments centre of excellence at Bassi in Jaipur district recently to study the prospects of introducing the technique in the state.Soon, the Australian government will send a formal proposal for sharing this technique with Rajasthan, after which the work will start, said Prabu Lal Saini, the state agriculture minister.Hydroponics is a method to grow plants without soil, using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent.The three-member delegation, including South Australian governments investment manager (Indian trade) Rahul Ranjan and Australian firm Ironwoods chief consultant Mark Cody, studied the site and infrastructure at the centre for two days beginning January 11.Saini said that hydroponics technique would be used in the farming of tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, cucumber (kheera) and coloured capsicum. The farming of these vegetables will be done in 4,000 square metre area in Bassi. Use of the technique would increase the yields manyfolds, he said.Generally, yield per plant of tomato in three months is around half a kg and when grown in poly house the yield increases to 5-6kg per plant in six months, but through the hydroponics technique, the yield per plant will increase to around 65-70kg per plant in 10 months. Similarly, yield of coloured capsicum and cucumber is around 4kg per plant, which will increase by six times to 24kg per plant, he informed. Such innovations will help in doubling the income of farmers, he added.The crop will be grown vertically to accommodate more plants in the same area, thus increasing the yield. More production of vegetables will help in curbing hike in prices and common man can get quality vegetables at affordable prices, he said.Once it is started at Bassi, hydroponics will be propagated to farmers in the state, he said. Even during these two years of pilot move, an Indian version of hydroponics technique will be developed so that farmers can afford it, he added.The agriculture department has sanctioned 13 crore for the two-year project starting from June this year. Saini said the department has constituted a committee to speed up the project. The project will be supervised by Rajasthan Olive Cultivation Limited (ROCL)."

By March 15, the botanists aim to scan more than 25,000 specimens and will send the digital images to the BSI.The BSI mooted the proposal in 2013 and it took them more than five years to ink the deal. The pioneer flora institute has plans to send 12 more botanists to London so that the scanning can be completed within a year to streamline the database, Singh said.The Portuguese introduced potato and tomato to India, he said.Being a staple food item in India, there is a need to identify the species that belong to the family, he said.We know of kand-mool, which has reference in historical transcripts but it was replaced by potato and tomato.The specimens at the London museum will help us to identify alternates of the two crops so that we can harvest the plants as well.Botanists are also scanning plant species from neighbouring countries, including Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar and this will help in understanding the genesis of different plant species."

In Rajasthan, modernisation faces a typical structural hurdle. The share of marginal and small land-holdings in total land ownership in the state is 40.12% and 21.90% respectively, according to the states Economic Survey 2017-18. Such highly skewed land distribution itself makes the use of even simpler tools, such as a tractor, uneconomical.A document on Rajasthans agriculture challenges by the Niti Aayog in 2016 cites this as a major barrier in effective intervention in the advancement of agriculture.Yet, Indias largest state with 61% arid or semi-arid climate and 35 million in poverty (those with less than Rs 1 lakh in annual income) wants to do an Israel in agriculture: make the desert bloom.It has, over the last couple of years, set up six hi-tech centres, such as the one outside Jaipur, to disseminate cutting-edge Israeli horticulture technologies. Three more are in the works. No state has so many Centres of Excellence.The six are in Kota (citrus fruits), Bassi (pomegranates), Jaiselmers Sagra Bhojhka (date palm), Devravas in Tonk district (guavas), Jhalawar (mandarins), and Khemri Dholpur ( mangoes). Three more are coming: Chittor (pumpkin), Boondi district (vegetables) and Sawai Madhopur (flowers). There is an olive programme as well.We have got the best technologies from countries such as Israel and Netherlands for these centres of excellence, says agriculture minister Prabhulal Saini.Why would a state with diverse farm produce want to go big on fruits and vegetables more suited for the overseas palate? Rajasthan is after all Indias largest producer of mustard, with a 48% share in national output. Despite being mostly arid, it is also the countrys largest producer of bajra (pearl millet), guar (cluster beans) and coarse cereals, apart from spices.Where state stands Agriculture comprises 27% ofRajasthans gross domestic productOn all-India basis, the state ranks second in total pulses and oilseeds as well as milk output. The main justification is that Rajasthans topography and agro-climatic conditions are similar to Israels. The Jewish state has been known for its agricultural success using innovation. Rajasthan too, the logic goes, can go from being David to Goliath in agriculture.There are both supporters and critics of this new strategy that aims to shift a sizeable section of middle farmers away from traditional water-guzzling crops, such as wheat.The idea is to make them grow citrus fruits and vegetables with water-economising technologies. In these crops, the state could do better, just like Israel. So, its looking at a mixed cropping patterns. A little maths and youll understand, says director horticulture VP Singh. Input costs in traditional crops are rising. Agree? And farmers returns are falling, he says.Greenhouse cucumber production gives an average 50 tonne of average production. The average cost of cucumber is about Rs 20 per kg. So thats Rs 10 lakh in total revenue. If total costs are Rs 3-4 lakh, that means saving of around Rs 6 lakh.On paper, this makes sense. On the ground, the task is neither easy nor cheap. One hurdle is funds. The number of applications from farmers aspiring to go high-tech is low but still far higher than earmarked subsidies can support.Moreover, farmers cant be dictated on what to grow and how much water to use. Israel overcame its water crisis by imposing huge tariffs on excessive water consumption. At the peak of a drought in 2010, citizens were asked to cut their shower time. Israelis couldnt wash cars with hoses.We cant do all that here. Rajasthan should not be growing much wheat. Where is the water? But you cant ban it. All we can do is give them alternatives, says Neelkamal Darbari, the states principal secretary.Agriculture  which contributes 27% to states GDP  has seen volatile returns mainly because of rainfall swings. For instance, in 2013-14, farm GDP grew an impressive 6.8%. That slowed to 2.6 in 2014-15. The next year (2015-16), farm growth almost flattened at 0.78%. It rebounded in 2016-17 at 6.3%.To popularise high value horticulture, the Vasundhara Raje-led state government launched a series of events to showcase technological demonstrations and attract investments.Three chapters of the Global Rajasthan Agritech Meet have been held so far  at Jaipur in November 2016, Kota in May 2017 and Udaipur in November, 2017. Approximately 1.23 lakh farmers participated in these events. They saw technology with their own eyes, Saini says. These events also led to 40 agreements worth Rs 1,555.83 crore for investments in agriculture and allied sectors, according to a government document.Until these investments come through, state subsidies are the only way. Protected cultivation is expensive. Since there is great demand, we will need substantially more funds, says Singh.Protected cultivation refers to a package of practices requiring capital investments in equipment such as greenhouses, shade-nets and micro-irrigation.The mission faces a classic budget constraint. The first limitation is that the National Horticulture Missions spending limit for protected cultivation is 25% of the total budget (of about Rs 150 crore annually). Farmers need to submit plans for a minimum of 2000 square meters (half an acre) to avail a subsidy of Rs 10 lakh (or 50% of the costs, whichever is lower). A protected-cultivation farm on one acre (4000 sq m) costs about Rs 35 lakh.Currently, the government has received about 1,500 applications from farmers for 5000 acres. For protected cultivation, the subsidy allotted is Rs 32 crore. Given that each farmer is entitled to Rs 10 lakh, only 320  or just 21%  can be covered in the short-term.If in a district, there are 100 applicants, then the waiting time can stretch up to 5 years, Singh adds. One of those in the queue is 50-year-old Bishen Paroda outside Sikar town, who says he wants to grow cucumber.To reduce the waiting time, Rajasthan has increased the subsidy limit to 70% from 50% for smaller farmers and sought to link them with bank loans. The Niti Aayog review says the subsidy for all types of farmers should be raised to 70%, otherwise the scheme could be adversely affected.Critics of the programme say Rajasthan cant take its eyes off traditional crops because thats what the majority grows. From an experiment point of view, hi-tech horticulture is fine. But there must be an income boost from traditional crops which employs the most people, says Bhagirath Choudhary, the director of the New Delhi-based South Asia Biotechnology Centre, who hails from the state."

I have not been able to recover the cost of cultivation due to the low prices of tomatoes, said Saini.Wholesalers at the wholesale fruit and vegetable mandi in Kota Prakash Batwani said that last year tomato prices were around Rs 25 per kg till December and around Rs 80 in July last year. However, at present, the prices are Rs 4 to Rs 8 per kg.The retail prices of tomato are around Rs 8 to Rs 10 per kg, he said.Giving reasons for the low prices, he said that tomato production increases in Kota and nearby areas in winter due to which prices come down around this time every year.Production of tomatoes in Bundi, Deoli region of Tonk, Kota, Sawai Madhopur and other nearby areas goes up in January-February every year. Due to this, tomato prices drop. But the prices go up during the monsoon season when there is no production of tomatoes locally and it is brought from other states such as Maharashtra and Karnataka, said Girish Dalwani , a tomato wholesaler.According to the horticulture department, tomato is cultivated on approximately 3,500 hectares of land in Kota division."

(Express photo by Kevin DSouza) A foodie, Ankita Raina has shed her calorific intemperance to improve her fitness. (Express photo by Kevin DSouza)The delicately delicious onion-tomato orgy on mutton for the Rogan Josh, was the biggest sacrifice Ankita Raina remembers making at the altar of tennis success. Olive oil drizzled salads and the bland pasta staple replaced the waft of a wonder memory of that Kashmiri kernel.Ankitas journey will continue from a strong showing at the Fed Cup in Delhi to the next port of call as she tries to better her ranking beyond 222the highest she reached around the time the last Fed Cup was played in India at Hyderabad in 2015. Indias No 1 takes flights mostly now, but recalled the train journey she undertook alone in 2012 as a 19-year-old finding her perfect Rogan Josh. I was playing a tournament in Delhi and realised itd been long since I visited my grandparents in Kashmir. First, all the cousins had planned to go, but then everyone else chickened out. There is a lot of strife there, but Kashmir is really heaven on earth, I found a lot of sukoon (peace) there at that time, she had said, speaking in the summer of 2015. Also, I really like mutton cooked in our Kashmiri stylewith lots of onion and tomatoes. That impulsive train journey was memorable, shed added with a sigh.Ankita is accustomed to long, meandering journeys in tennisand not just matches that last 2 hours-24 minutes, and 2 hours-53 the next day to beat Chieh-Yu Hsu incidentally Indias longest Fed Cup tie over the last weekend in Delhi. I always loved travelling by train as a child, and hated returning home. Tennis took me to places like Kavali in Andhra, Gulbarga and Mandya and I started travelling alone at 14. It used to be scary sometimes  new places, new culture, but I realised I dont panic immediately. Also you cant stop trains by pulling chains in Morocco! she laughs retelling her pet tale.Ankita Rainas oft-told Casablanca story involves a miss and a sigh. Followed by some shrill, hysterical cries of Pull it again, man! as she tried to stop a train she was travelling in, by cranking repeatedly at the first thing resembling a chain, with a friend screaming nearby.The pair of them, teenaged tennis players from India, had landed at Casablanca and were to take a connecting train from the basement of the airport to Rabat in Morocco for a junior tournament. The two misheard announcements alternating in Arabic and French and would miss their station just as Ankita  an accomplished train traveller back home owing to her India-wide criss-crossing for ITF juniors meets, immediately scanned around for a chain to pull and bring the train to a halt. Its when she rushed to the door pressing frantically at the buttons  that the chaos reached a crescendo. The pair were slapped a fine of 6000 dirhams. This opened the floodgates of the bawling friend. When the TC came, I told him how we were headed for a tennis tournament, and were traveling alone. We were very little and howling, and they finally understood and put us on the train back, she recalled.Indias top singles player at World No 253 has had a different graph than the countrys high-achieving predecessor in singlesSania Mirza. At 25, the results havent come in a bunch and she continues to battle to climb every step of the rankings ladder. The turbulence on the flight up hasnt quite stopped. My first flight alone was to Hyderabad and I told people I was 15. I was actually carrying a note from parents that said I was 12 and needed supervision, she recalled. Other adventures include winning a meet in Muzaffarnagar, watched by a ring of phlegmatic policemen guarding the tournament in the crime-infested area.When you dont hit the double digits of rankings early in tennis, theres a lot of unglamorous detours and wrong trains where life inadvertently takes you. Remaining undefeated in singles through a zonal Fed Cup week in your national capital has taken time to happen, with the double-fisted backhand and the serve variations for speed and placement, still being work in progress.Though her father accompanied her to meets in her pre-teens, it was her mum who nudged her into tennis. I started at 4. My mother was a sports enthusiast who did athletics and TT. Travelling with a parent though means double the cost so I had to learn to fend for myself very early, she added. The family had first watched Tim Henman play a Satellite Challenger at Ahmedabad where young Ankita chased the Brit for autographs, and it was from watching Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi that the girl started falling for the game.After some male players from Ahmedabad started training at Hemant Bendres academy in Pune, Ankita would shift too. Though her favourite surface for her aggressive game remains grass, shed do well on hard courts even while practicing on clay taking her time to learn the proper clay game of slices and slugging. Ankita favoured the chip and charge and took a liking for the drop shotsomething she used when downing Yulia Putintseva, the 81-ranked combustible Kazakh. As a kid, Ankita started loving smacking the ball and didnt hold back even if they kept landing long and thumping against fences at Ahmedabad.The forehand was developing into a weapon, but in 2012 shed run into a Chinese at a meet to secure a wildcard for the Australian Open who kept banging the ball with such menace that rallying at that speed got impossible. She would double her gym work to gain that kind of power, and though she detested running rounds, weight training soon became the favourite part of her workout. I have puked during running sessions though to try and get to that level of stamina, she recalled. 2013 would see her change her diet after extensive travel and oily food gave her acidity and sore throats during matches. I was a foodie. Then suddenly my dietician was telling me about olive oil and eating right, she said.All the time she would be wracked by the perennial dilemmawhether to chase titles at smaller events that fetched her headlines to woo the sponsors, or whether to play the higher graded meets of WTA and push for ranking points. All my time was spent making decisionstaking gambles on meets and balancing risks, one eye at the entry date, the other at withdrawals. Retreating from Japan, going to Marrakesh. After the last Fed Cup, Sania advised me on which tournaments to pick. When she was coming up, she was an inspiration and it was a dream to try play like her. Everyone used to say, Indians are not that strong, and we dont have the genes for tennis. Its difficult but Sania proved its possible, she added.On rough days, the family including brother Ankur, would be rushing from embassy to airportwith Ankita taking in her stride different cities and time zonesjust trying to get to the venue, tired and spent and losing in the first round as a result. There are times when Id feel low and not confident. But Id think that when I succeed all the praise will be for me, while my family is doing it all selflessly, she said.Her transition from juniors to seniors was typically protracted, and shed seek help of a psychologist. Ankita frequently started using the drop shot in stiff tie breakers. After a point, finishing the crunch matches is all mental, she had said, after a few close matches at the Fed Cup went the other way.From 2015 to now, Raina seems to have sorted out her end-game and won all her singles matches this time. Her parents whod watched Sharapova win the Wimbledon in 2004, would chip in with advice: how Cibulkova was always on her toes and jumping on court, how Ivanovic picked everything on the rise, how Federer stayed calm and Nadal covered the court. I went through a phase where I used to be confused  I wanted to be calm and aggressive also at the same time, she chuckled, adding that though she used to be shy off-court, she could pull out the fangs when playing.Ankita, meanwhile faced problems that tennis divinity rarely does. First it was tough to travel much, then I started feeling the need for a physio. The shoulder would get tight when I pushed too hard in training, she said. Shed stack up some good results in doubles in makeshift partnerships, but it needed solid singles results for Raina to grab eyeballs.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

A misal-pav stall run by the Tellis family has been dishing out the street favourite between 4 am and 7 am for long enough to do without advertising. From selling tea, driving an autorickshaw and now selling misal, the Tellis family has always preferred the night to make a living. Elar Tellis, popularly known as Michael, came to Mumbai from his native Mangalore 45 years ago. Starting off with a tea stall, the story of his misal-pav joint at Sarvodaya Nagar in Mulund West unfolds at night. The joint mainly attracts corporate employees who work until the early hours, along with a younger crowd on their way home from late night parties.I had a tea stall in Mangalore, but as I didnt earn enough for my family, I came to Mumbai when I was 14 years old on my friends suggestion. I initially started working at stalls at the Andheri railway station and later, worked at Bandra. But I always wanted to have my own business, Michael said. He then started selling tea in Mulund along with his two younger brothers.After working with others for five years, I learnt how to run a business in Mumbai, so I started my own and got my two brothers Marshal and Xavier on board, said Michael, adding that he had been witness to the transformation of the eastern suburb of Mulund from a forest area to a residential one.I would start selling tea at 4 am as I was told that in Mumbai, I would end up earning more money as people usually step out at night and look for tea stalls. However, I didnt earn much by selling tea. We then took a loan and bought a rickshaw which my brother would drive. He drove during night hours and I would drive during the day after selling tea in the early hours, he said.With a loan to repay, Michael then decided to make good on his idea to start an eatery. In the initial days of his tea stall, a family ran an eatery next to it, recalled Michael. However, suddenly one day, the family closed the stall and disappeared.Michaels son Santosh Tellis said: My father saw that the eatery had been closed for many days, following which he got the idea of starting his own. Then, we set up the stall and started selling misal from 3 am to 7 am. During the initial days, we were incurring heavy losses as we didnt attract too many customers. But, after Ganesh Chaturthi, we started getting business and we started recovering the losses. People would come to our stall aftervisarjan and eat misal, and that is how word spread across Mulund. Since then, the Tellis family has been running a misal joint at night, following which they return to their day jobs  the father runs a tea stall and the son is employed with an online shopping portal.Michael and Santosh wake up at 2 am, and after preparing a hearty dish of misal, the duo start selling it at around 4 am. I have to sleep early at night so that I can wake up early, following which I have to report to my job at 10 am. As my father is ageing, we have also hired two person to take care of our tea stall while my father supervises the business during the day, said Santosh.The midnight misal is served at Rs 40 per plate with two pavs. The stall also sells taripav at Rs 10 per piece. They attract customers from Ghatkopar, Powai, Thane, Bhandup and Airoli. In taripav, we basically mix ingredients of misal, like sprouts, moth beans, farsan, tomatoes, onions, boiled potatoes, lemon and coriander and then hand it over to the customer, said Santosh. Between 4 am and 6 am, the joint is crowded with customers, and many of them end up asking for takeaways.A resident of Mulund, Varun Ghatani, said: My personal favourite is taripav, and whenever I go out with my friends for night-outs, I see to it that I visit Michael and eat taripav.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

And while a majority of Indian farmers cultivate their own land, Dalit farmers in much of the country continue to work for wages, data released last week by the Census of India confirms.The data shows that 71% of Scheduled Caste farmers are what the census refers to as agricultural labourers  that is, they work for wages on others land. That figure is much lower among other groups: 47% for Scheduled Tribe farmers and 41% for non-SC/ST farmers.We are thinking of the agricultural community as one group, and providing it with a number of sops, said Nilanjan Ghosh, a senior fellow and head of economics at the non-partisan Observer Research Foundation in Kolkata. But the benefit is essentially being obtained by landowners, and it hardly goes to the labourers. We dont have anything for them. Other economists agreed. Any gains from these policies are unlikely to be passed down in terms of higher wages, Ashwini Deshpande, a professor at the University of Delhis School of Economics, said in an email. On the whole it would be safe to say that, by and large, these policies do not touch agricultural labour.Wages for agricultural labourers have not increased in the last four years, according to Himanshu, a professor at the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi. This, even as the Centre and states have introduced policies meant to alleviate farmer distress  loan waivers, crop insurance, and increased MSP, which ensure that farmers make a profit on their produce. Even if big farmers or medium farmers have access to the minimum support price, it is not necessary that they will pass on that benefit to agricultural labourers, Ghosh said.In fact, there is no such study which shows that agricultural labourers are going to be affected from an increase in the minimum support price or even from farm loan waivers.Landlessness among Dalits has deep historical roots.For centuries, Dalits were expressly prohibited from owning land. Even if reforms after Independence have helped level the playing field, economic and social pressures over the last two decades have increased the proportion of landless farmers across all social sectors.The land is limited. As the population is increasing, pressure on land is also increasing, Himanshu said. It is expected that some increase would happen in the level of agricultural labourers over time.Regardless of caste or class, life is generally harder for landless farmers, according to Jayshree Sengupta of the Observer Research Foundations Economy and Development Programme.There is more incidence of suicides among agricultural labour than farmers/cultivators because they do not have access to any type of formal institutional loans and loan waivers have bypassed them. Around 70% of labourers are in debt, Sengupta said in an email."

At the same time, I discovered that there werent too many entertainment options available for children except cartoons, which are synthetic, and thats how I came up with the concept of salad stories.In a salad story, healthy foods are used to tell an informative and engaging story, to make meal time both educational, nutritious and a time of bonding.A total of 28 lucky early-bird kids aged 2.5 to 8 participated in the workshop with their parents.My daughter eats almost everything, but has preferences when it comes to vegetables.

This claim requires clarity, says Kavitha Kuruganti of the Alliance for Sustainable & Holistic Agriculture, in an interview with Zia Haq. Kuruganti was a member of the Ramesh Chand Committee on farm prices.The FM announced MSPS will be set at 1.5 times over costs of production, or 50% returns. He hasnt clarified if this increase will be over the so called C2 costs of cultivation, which is the main demand, or A2 costs. Can you explain why this is vital?In terms of cost accounting principles and practice, it is important to get a comprehensive picture of costs, which include opportunity costs. That will then give you a good picture of net returns. The Commission on Agricultural Costs and Prices itself calculates net returns in terms of C2 cost and not A2 (paid out components + family labour). C2 is a cost estimation, which (unlike A2) also includes rental value of own land and value of owned fixed capital assets. The reason why the government should exclude these two additional components also -while it includes imputed family labour on own land -in its selective cost definition, is irrational. Meanwhile, in the Ramesh Chand Committee report, we pointed out to various other ways in which cost is suppressed. That needs to be addressed too.People have argued that farmers costs are underestimated.While that is the theoretical part of the issue at debate here, what is important to realise is that official data is clearly showing that our farmers are in distress. Their income is not growing. A majority of farmers has negative net returns. The intersectoral disparities are increasing, which are not good in any society. There is also a moral imperative, that farmers are keeping us all alive, and we owe it to them.So are you saying the MSP claim is misleading?Prices are clearly the most proximal and direct ways to improve incomes. The government should stop trying to cheat farmers here. This government has given significantly lower margins on an average, whichever cost definition you adopt, compared to the earlier government. This, despite explicitly promising at least 50% margins over the cost of production. They have to make good on their promises.What are the kind of returns farmers are now getting? In terms of the ground reality, is it true that MSPS for the current rabi sown season gave 50% returns, as claimed by the finance minister?The NSSOS (National Sample Survey Office) 70th round shows that most farmers have monthly incomes lower than their monthly basic expenses. The average per day per capita earning in our farm households is lower than the legally prescribed minimum wages for agricultural workers in the country. The finance minister made an incorrect statement when he said that in this rabi, they have provided 50% margins since wheat, which had the highest MSP rise, has just 38% margin over C2 costs of cultivation. Not a single rabi crop has touched a 50% margin over C2.Would you agree that this Budget has put the rural economy and agriculture back on the governments priority?I will not agree. It is true that the current farmers unrest and struggles, in addition to recent election results, have put farmers back on the national debate, but the government hasnt incorporated any concrete thing that would address farmers problems. Only 2.3% of the entire budget has been given to agriculture. In fact, this government is being unresponsive and irresponsible towards farmers.Do you think Operation Greens for higher values through processing from tomato, onions and potatoes is a step towards focusing on incomes end of the spectrum?The details of this are yet to be seen. What we have been asking for is an MSP for these perishables also, which is guaranteed to farmers, in a statutory manner, along with other agri commodities."
5aeae8af9855b73f522c4a90,Budget 2018: Jaitley Promises Farmers 50% Returns over Cultivation Costs,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/budget-2018-jaitley-promises-farmers-50-returns-over-cultivation-costs/story-C5oo7V5HT9c9vRjF5CrNlM.html,2018-02-02,,Hindustan Times,"Kicking off with a burst of announcements for the farm sector, finance minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday said the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government would deliver on its promise of ensuring 50% returns for farmers, seeking to address rural angst due to collapsing prices.In his budget speech, Jaitley said federally determined minimum support prices (MSPs) for summer-sown (kharif) crops this year would be set at 1.5 times the cost of cultivation, which translates to 50% returns.This has been a key demand by protesting farmers in several agriculturally developed states, such as Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.Jaitley surprised critics by declaring that his government had already adhered to this pricing benchmark for most crops in the ongoing rabi-sown (winter) season. He said this would be henceforth applied for the rest of crops. The government has decided to keep MSP for the all unannounced crops of kharif at least at one and half times of their production cost, he said.The finance minister did not announce any specific price-deficit payment scheme to compensate farmers directly for market losses when prices dip below MSPs, as was widely anticipated. Such a scheme is already being implemented in Madhya Pradesh. He, instead, said that Niti Ayog would soon come out with a foolproof mechanism on how to compensate farmers when prices crash.The budget announcement comes amid a rough patch in the agriculture sector, forecast to grow just 2.1% in 2017-18, as against 4.9% in the previous year. The announcement of 50% returns over costs set off a flurry of debate on the fine print, with farm leaders wondering which of the two measures of cultivation costs  the so-called C2 or A2 + FL  the government would adopt. Jaitley did not specify the measure that will be used.C2 is a more comprehensive measure of a farmers cultivation costs, which includes imputed rental value of land, depreciation and interests on capital. These are not part of the A2+FL, a narrower measure that includes input costs and imputed value of only family labour.The crux of the battle on prices boils down to the governments definition on cost of productionThe government seems to have chosen a lower cost measure so that it can declare that it is already providing cost + 50% in this rabi, said Kiran Vissa of the Rythu Swarajya Vedika, part of a platform of farmer organisations. He said when PM Narendra Modi had promised 50% returns in his election campaign, MSPs were already giving higher returns than under Modis tenure.In 2007, the MS Swaminathan Committee had recommended 50% returns for crops, which the BJPs 2014 poll manifesto adopted. In the para containing the specific recommendation, the Swaminathan report said MSP should be 50% over costs of cultivation, not specifying which measure. But in its annexure, the report used C2 costs to calculate net farmer returns.Economist Ashok Gulati told HT that for rabi crops, the MSP was closer towards 50% of costs. In wheat, it is in the region of 44%-45%, but in other crops it is just 20%-30%. The real challenge is for kharif crops. In paddy, MSPs and returns are not more than 10%-12%, he said. If the government actually sets MSPs at 1.5 times the C2 costs, then it would also mean a huge jump in the food subsidy bill and make Indias produce expensive in the exports market, he said.The budget announced a new scheme called Operation Greens to promote value addition for tomato, onion and potato. This would be similar to Operation Flood that revolutionsed the dairy sector, Jaitley said. Two funds to boost fisheries and animal husbandry were allotted Rs10,000.The budget also set a target of Rs11 lakh crore for agriculture credit in 2018-19, a 10% rise. Jaitley said 22,000 new and existing rural marketplaces would be developed to give farmers access to buyers. Tenant farmers would be made eligible for farm loans under a new policy, he said, adding a liberalised farm-exports regime was in the works. Various ministries will have Rs14.34 lakh crore in all to create rural jobs and infrastructure.With a view to boost food processing, which can improve commodity prices, allocation to the food processing ministry was being doubled from Rs715 crore in 2017-18 to Rs1,400 crore in 2018-19, Jaitley said."

Tracing gold supply is key to preventing metal that funds armed conflict from entering world markets, identifying owners and maintaining security from mine to vault.The LBMA has pushed ahead with efforts to modernize a trade that until recent years relied on phone auctions to set a key benchmark price for the market.For us, its a question of where the gold comes from, Mirza said.The LBMA oversees a list of refiners approved to supply the London market. Its London Good Delivery List sets global standards for large gold and silver bars. The LBMA will also study tagging the metal and using other security features to ensure bars are exactly what they say they are, it said in a statement on Tuesday.Everything that ends up in an LBMA good-delivery refiner needs to be tracked in the supply chain, regardless of whether it ends up as a large bar in a London vault, a kilo bar shipped to the Far East, or a coin owned by a collector, Mirza said. A lot has been done already but its still very paper-based. We now want to formalize it through an efficient and possibly technologically based solution. Bloomberg"

In fact, DySP Srinivas, Puttur Rural Circle Inspector Gopal Naik, Uppinangady Sub Inspector Nandakumar and other police personnel were camping in Mithamajalu since morning.When ANF members showed the photographs of a few Maoists to the inmates of the house, they (residents) said that the Maoists have identified themselves as ""Rajesh"" and ""Latha"".Mithamajalu, situated two-kilometres away from National Highway has 40 houses, of which three houses are situated on the periphery of the forest. The Maoist members had visited the houses on Sunday night. However, it was kept a secret till Monday evening. It was through schoolchildren that the news was spread among the villagers.Puttur DySP Srinivas said that the visit of Maoists to the houses has been confirmed. Two teams of ANF have started combing operations.'Did not threaten'One of the residents of the house that the Maoists visited said, ""The members just informed that they were Maoists and asked us not to inform anyone. They did not threaten us.""A team with two men and a woman entered the house at 7.30 pm on Sunday. After introducing themselves as Purushotham, Rajesh and Latha, they asked for groceries. ""When I informed that there is no rice and asked them whether they needed dosa and tea, they replied in the negative."" They also wanted to know whether there is any rich person's house in the village, the resident said.When my brother visited the house, they accompanied him to his house. They were in my house for 10 minutes only. All were wearing green trousers and shirt and were armed, the resident said.Her brother said, ""Maoist Rajesh asked for 10 kg of rice. When I said there are no shops nearby, they demanded rice from the house. They have taken 3 kg boiled rice, 8 kg white rice, tomato and potato from my house.""Enquiries madeThe trio were also asking for Biju, whom they said had reportedly informed the police about their visit to Subrahmanya last time.As a result, one of their collegue Yellappa was killed in crossfire with the ANF (in 2012).Another resident said: ""I encountered three members of the Maoists first. My parents had gone to the temple on account of Sankranti. When I heard dogs barking, I came out of the house and saw three armed persons at my yard. When they introduced themselves as Maoists, I ran towards my uncle's house."""

Researchers in the city have come up with a do-it-yourself solution to protect yourself from poison that might be on your plate. Mix 160 ml of acetic acid with 4 grams of baking soda and concentrated juice of 4 lemons in 4 litres of water. Use this to was your vegetables to ensure that pesticides are removed.A student of Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University (PJTSAU) conducted a study to find out efficacy of tap water and various liquid solutions that can be made at home to remove pesticide residues from vegetables.Comparison of the efficacy of these methods revealed that the solution of acetic acid, baking soda, lemon juice and water in right proportions was much more efficient in removing the pesticide residues compared to the use of only tap water.The study by Sudhakar S Kelageri of PJTSAU published recently in the Journal of Entomology and Zoology Studies reports that dipping tomatoes for 10 minutes in a solution of 160 ml of acetic acid with 4 grams of baking soda and lemon juice from 4 lemons in 4 litres of water followed by washing off the tomatoes with tap water, could remove pesticides residues in the range of 55-76 percent.This formulation is developed by All India Network Project on Pesticide Residues at PJTSAU and is named as Veggy wash. Compared to Veggy wash, the efficacy of washing vegetables with only tap water was just around 17-39 per cent.Effectiveness of Veggy wash was checked on five pesticides - Dimethoate, lambda-Cyhalothrin, Flubendiamide and Profenophos which are widely used by farmers on tomato, a vegetable that finds high usage in Indian cooking as well as in salads for raw consumption. While the published study was on tomato, these five pesticides find wide usage in other vegetables as well.It was found that Veggy wash could remove 76.7 per cent of dimethoate, 68.8 percent of lambda-Cyhalothrin, 55.1 per cent of phosalone, 65.3 per cent of flubendiamide and 75.8 per cent of profenofos. It may be mentioned here that profenofos is widely used on vegetables in India although it is not recommended for usage on vegetables by Central Insecticide Board and Registration Committee and it is listed as moderately hazardous by World Health Organization. Another effective solution listed in the study was 4 percent acetic acid solution prepared by mixing 160 ml of acetic acid in 4 litres of water."

The Sabarmati ashram is sited between a jail and a crematorium, and Gandhi believed that a Satyagraha invariably had to go to either place. He is believed to have said, This is the right place for our activities to carry on the search for Truth and develop fearlessness, for on one side are the iron bolts of the foreigners, and on the other the thunderbolts of Mother Nature.It was also from here that he launched the famous Dandi March or Salt Satyagraha in 1930, in protest against the increased taxes on Indian salt in an effort to promote sales of British salt in India.Adalaj VavGujarat has some beautiful step wells and this is certainly one of them. This intricately carved five storeys deep step well was started in the 15th century by Rana Veer Singh to alleviate the misery of his subjects who had to face severe water shortage and completed by a Muslim king, Mehmud Begda in the Indo-Islamic architectural style.Built in sandstone it is octagonal at the top, and stands on a large number of gorgeously carved pillars. Spacious, each floor can accommodate sizeable congregations. The floral motifs and Islamic graphics blend rather well with the Hindu symbols carved at various levels of the well. The carvings depict women in daily chores like churning of buttermilk, adorning themselves, dancers and musicians performing, and the King overlooking all these activities. Dont be surprised if you find hordes of tourists filling every possible space in the huge stepwell, most of them in the serious pursuit of either posing for pictures or indulging in taking selfies.Sidi Saiyyed MosqueThis mosque is famous for beautifully carved ten stone latticework windows on the side and rear arches. This intricately carved lattice stone window is the Sidi Saiyyed Jali, the unofficial symbol of city of Ahmedabad and the inspiration for the design of the logo of the Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad. Our visit coincided with the Maghrib prayers: in the midst of a chaotic traffic, the mosque lent serenity and the soft light from the ambience further enhanced its beauty.Teen DarwazaKing Ahmed Shah built this historical gate in the 15 century. This is where we found the most chaotic and undisciplined traffic. The roads were overflowing with people, hawkers, small time shopkeepers with mountains of goods, and ruthless two wheeler drivers with intimidating horns.Manek ChowkHere the street food stalls at night are a big attraction. It is a vegetable market in the morning, a jewellery market (supposed to be the second biggest in India) in the noon and a street food market at night. The food stalls start to emerge around 9:30 in the evening and continue till late night. The mouth-watering snacks make you ignore the not so clean surroundings. Besides many delicacies, Manek Chowk is best known for its kulfi but we had fafda (that came with a chutney setting the tongue on fire) and hot jalebis: an unusual combination.PolsIt is worth seeing a Pol in the old Ahmedabad. They contain old beautiful houses with internal courts having intricate wooden carved facades with columns and fresco work done around court walls or ceilings. Pol architecture is an interesting evolution in urban living space.The word pol is derived from the Sanskrit word pratoli meaning entrance to an enclosed area. Pols were originally made as a protection measure when communal riots necessitated greater security probably dating from 1738 during Mughal-Maratha rule (1738-1753) in Ahmedabad. A typical pol would have only one or two entrances and also some secret entrances known only to people residing in a pol.Sasu Ji for lunchOne of the best places to taste an authentic Gujarati thaali as the warm and hospitable staff pampers you. We started with many bowls of baasundi, tiny Malpuas dripping with sugar syrup; Cheese Wonton (?? Chinese?? Yes!!), Shahi Dhokla, Patra for starters (Farsan), for the main course it was Paneer Pasanda, Undhiyu (a mixed vegetable dish with muthia-dumplings made with fenugreek leaves and spiced besan), Batata Tameta (tomato?), methi papad, poories, rice, rotisof course, you cant finish all this, however generous Sasu ji is!Mirch Masala for dinnerA themed restaurant, based on old Hindi films, here you have paintings of Kaka (Rajesh Khanna) and other film stars staring at you from every wall. We polished platefuls of kebabs as Hrithik Roshan watched us lovingly.Law GardenShopping cant get any better. The goods are attractive, prices quite reasonable.

TGIFridays has recently launched their hangover brunch every weekend, which has all the right appetisers, entrees and desserts to satisfy your hungover heart, as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks to either refresh you, or keep the buzz going.We started the meal with some mocktails  the Basil Peach Cooler and the Gold Mango Margarita, both of which were a tad bit too strong for our tastes, but were also high on flavour and taste. We tried the Chocolate Milkshake next, which was rich, thick and decadent  just how a good milkshake should be.If you are looking to keep their spirits high by taking care of your hangover with another drink, try Hangover Bloody Mary. This drink, is a meal in itself. The tall glass, the classic tomato juice-based cocktail is served in, is decorated with a lamb slider, chicken wings, fries and celery sticks - an ideal meal for one. The red wine sangria is also a good option  sweeter and full of fruit than sangrias served in most other places.TGIF has a number of options in appetisers. From egg-heavy dishes such as Breakfast Tacos and Breakfast Potato Skins, to fried food for the hungover soul. We tried the Calamari Frites, and though hesitant to try shellfish in places not directly on the coast, we found this dish to be fresh, crispy and delicious, complemented perfectly with marinara sauce. We also tried the Friday Mushrooms - crispy batter fried mushrooms served with a sauce.For mains, we first tried the Classic American Veg Pizza, and though not up to par with the some of the great pizza Bengaluru has been serving up of late, it does have a very homemade feel to it. The Pasta Alfredo is not for the faint hearted or the almost-full, as it is very creamy and rich, just the way an Alfredo ought to be. The winner among the mains for us was the Hangover Burger, again, meant for someone with a hearty appetite. This delicious monster has a juicy lamb patty paired with bacon, caramelized onions and all your other burger fixings, and is topped off with a fried egg. Some of the other good options among the mains are the Steak and Eggs and the Crispy Chicken Sliders.For dessert, we thought wed keep it simple, and the brunch menu has also stuck to the same theme by only listing two dishes. We tried the Sizzling Brownie, and it was one of the best weve had in recent times, and also much bigger than most. Served with large scoop of vanilla ice cream and generous amounts of chocolate sauce, it was the perfect end to this gastronomic meal.The Hangover brunch is on every Saturday and Sunday, 12 noon to 3 pm. Prices start at ` 1,695."

Photo: AlamyAmong the many ways of looking at Frankenstein, and by Frankenstein one necessarily means not just Mary Shelleys groundbreaking book but what that book birthed over 200 yearsas other authors, playwrights, theatre producers and film-makers prodded away at it, moving body parts around in their sinister laboratorieshere is one interpretation. It is about terrible and unhappy parents, terrible and unhappy children, and how, to misquote Philip Larkin, we pass misery back and forth.Youre Victor Frankenstein, you think youve done your best, but heres this monster you created, which refuses to be what you hoped it would be. Worse, it turns around and blames you for everything thats wrong. Look at the Paradise Lost lineDid I request thee, Maker, from my clay, To mould me Man?which serves as an epigraph for Shelleys novel, and then listen to director Guillermo del Toro, who is currently working on a Frankenstein film: Its the quintessential teenage book. You dont belong. You were brought to this world by people that dont care for you and you are thrown into a world of tears and hunger.Most parent-child relationships, when looked at over a period of time, bring high tragedy and slapstick comedy together in the same frame. Little wonder then that cinematic Frankensteins have inhabited every mode from deep seriousness to goofy, pseudo-science-driven humourand that the most enduring films accommodate both extremes.Consider one of the most effective scenes, gentle, idyllic and horrifying all at once, in James Whales 1931 Frankenstein. Boris Karloffs monster comes across a little girl, joins her in placing flowers on a lakes surface and watching them floatand then, in all innocence, dunks her into the water too, causing her death. So iconic was this momentoften censored in early screeningsthat 40 years later the Spanish director Vctor Erice made it the focal point of his coming-of-age narrative The Spirit Of The Beehive: the six-year-old protagonist Ana is traumatized when she watches the scene; in the days that follow, she becomes aware of subtler monsters in her own world.Or see Whales 1935 sequel, Bride Of Frankenstein, in which Karloffs plaintivenessas the monster yearns for a companion who will love and understand himbrushes up against Elsa Lanchesters brief but delightfully lunatic performance as his bride-not-to-be (the actress also played an impish Mary Shelley in a short scene).Those are still the two best-known Frankenstein films, and to modern eyes they can seem creaky and overwrought. Taking cues from theatre adaptations staged in Mary Shelleys lifetime, they turned Victor Frankenstein into the prototype of the mad scientist, shrieking that he knows what its like to be God (in the book he is a diligent, conscientious man). But Karloffs performance helps erase some of the differences. While the creature in Shelleys novel gains in eloquence and dignity once he learns to use language, the dumb movie monster is sympathetic by other means, conveying childlike pathos through his gestures and expressions. In fact, one can argue that in the broader-comedy scenes where he grunts wordsthe refrain of Good! Good! when an old hermit makes him taste bread and winehe becomes less likable.A still from Mary Shelleys Frankenstein. Photo: AlamyOf course, there are other films where the monster is not meant to be at all likablesee the 1957 Curse Of Frankenstein, starring those two masters of the Hammer Horror franchise, Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, and watch Lee play the role as a deformed, inexpressive zombie, starting with the shocking moment where he rips the bandages off his face as the camera zooms in on him.Another dominant mode is that of parody mixed with affection for the source material. Mel Brooks 1974 Young Frankenstein, shot in atmospheric black and white, has madcap scenes like the one where the doctors assistant brings along a brain labelled Abnormalthinking it belonged to someone named Abbie Normalbut the film also understands the sense of wonder and danger that permeates the original story. This is equally true of three 1980s filmsGothic, Haunted Summer and Rowing With The Windwhich arent straight renderings of the Frankenstein tale but dramatize the famous 1816 summer house party involving the Shelleys and Lord Byron, where both Frankenstein and the John Polidori horror story The Vampyre were conceived.And, of course, there are serious Frankenstein movies, which usually err on the side of earnestness. Kenneth Branaghs 1994 Mary Shelleys Frankenstein set out to be faithful to the book, in a way the Karloff films never did, but the promise was marred by half-hearted executionand ironically its best moments were the more inventive ones such as the scene where the naked creature (played by Robert De Niro, channelling a middle-aged Travis Bickle) slips about like a newborn baby in what looks like amniotic fluid.Frankenstein is often regarded as the first true science-fiction novel, and this perception has become increasingly relevant in our time, where Artificial Intelligence has taken on forms that Mary Shelley couldnt have envisioned. The idea of an imitation human being more humane in some ways than the flesh-and-blood people around him is a theme that has informed a lot of modern sci-fi about automatons: from the replicants in Blade Runner to the 1999 Bicentennial Man (adapted from Isaac Asimovs The Positronic Man) and Steven Spielbergs A.I. Artificial Intelligence (based on Brian Aldisss Supertoys Last all Summer Long, and often seen as a futuristic version of the Pinocchio story).But its just as instructive to go back in time, to two decades before the Karloff films, when a 12-minute Frankenstein was made by Thomas Edisons studio in 1910. Watching this relic (youll find it on YouTube) is like getting into a time machine: given that the world of the Shelleys seems so impossibly distant to us today, its unsettling to realize that the Edison film is closer in time (a mere 92 years) to the publication of the book than to our present day.What I find fascinating about that ancient filmas a cinema student and as someone who thinks of the Frankenstein story as being rooted in honest scientific curiosityis how much it does with the very limited motion-picture technology of the time. For instance, for the challenging scene in which the monster comes alive, a wax replica of a skeleton was placed in a vat and set afire until it dissolved and crumpled. They then played the film backward, so that the impression we get is of something hideous being forged out of fire and sitting upright after its limbs have formed.To watch that scene is to think of the imagination and daring required of early film-makers when they wanted to do something more ambitious than simply record reality. One could say those pioneers were kindred spirits of Victor Frankenstein, tinkering in their workshops until their children grew and became something vast and uncontrollable, slipping out of their godlike hands."
5aeb03a09855b73f522c5e43,Parottas from Deep Down South,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2018/jan/19/parottas-from-deep-down-south-1758979.html,2018-01-20,,The New Indian Express,"lSabyasachi Roy Chaudhuri ByExpress News ServiceHYDERABAD: Parottas or layered flour breads are popular in the southern states of India as well as the island country of Sri Lanka. Whereas Malabar parotta from Kerala is the most well-known among these, there are other variants like kothu, veechu, lappa and Ceylon parottas which are in demand in these places. It is said that the parotta recipes of South India did not migrate from the northern part of the country, instead, it was the Sinhalese workers in the southern part of Tamil Nadu and Kerala who brought these recipes from the island. The Arab traders visiting the coastline also had a role to play in this.Each type of parotta has its own unique style of preparation. For example, for making Veechu Parotta, a popular dish from Madurai, the dough is spun in the air to make the parotta thinner. The thin layered bread is then folded and fried in oil. This dish is popular in Southern Tamil Nadu and gets its name from veesu, which in Tamil means tossing in the air. Ceylon Paratha is a two-layered parotta usually stuffed with vegetables or meat. The parottas is normally served with a gravy known as salna as well as onion raita.Kothu Parotta is a completely different dish altogether. Roasted parottas are chopped into small pieces and sauted on a tawa with masala, and other ingredients like onions, tomatoes, chillies, egg and even meat. Beachside shacks in Sri Lanka are known for the varieties of Kothu Parottas that they rustle up. Seeing the parotta being prepared in front of you and the sound of chopping and mixing itself makes you feel hungry.Lappa is typically made with an egg filling and is widely known as muttai lappa in parts of Tamil Nadu. After preparation, the parotta is again covered with another layer of egg batter, before folding into triangular or square shapes and fried. The recipe has influences of Arabic cuisine with strong similarities with muttabaq, a popular Arabic dish.Pondy Parottas, with two outlets at Madhura Nagar and Hi-Tec City, brings all these types of parottas to Hyderabad. As per Rajasubbaiah who owns this place, the kothu parotta here is prepared in the special Karaikal style, where the masala is cooked on the tawa folded inside the parotta and then chopped into pieces. For Lappa, the stuffing is uniformly spread on the parotta directly on the tawa. They have chicken, mutton and seafood versions of the parottas, as well as kalaki, an omelette type egg delicacy popular in Tamil Nadu.Sabyasachi is a food enthusiast and blogs at www.foodaholix.in"

How does one make art so that it breathes politics and forces the viewer to return the gesture -- with an act of seeing? At the Art Heritage gallery this weekend, a group show of nine artists, mostly from Kerala, offer diverse perspectives.Gigi Scaria, GR Iranna, Baiju Parthan, Jyothi Basu, KP Reji, NN Rimzon, Pooja Iranna, Sumedh Rajendran and TV Santhoshs works form the second edition of the exhibition Negotiation in Contested Space  Part 1. Conceptualised by Renuka Sawhney, a writer who works in New York, it was first held in Mumbai in 2017. Veteran stage and costume designer and director, Art Heritage, Amal Allana has curated it for the Delhi edition.As in India today, Contested Space is about the different pulls that are dividing up the space or the ground we stand on, says Allana while pointing out to an artwork that illustrates this. KP Rejis Moving the Mountain is a startling image of what seems to be dead bodies wrapped in cloths of bright yellow hoisted atop a vehicle with no exit  no door or window  pulled from both sides by hooks.KP Rejis Moving the Mountain (Photo courtesy: KP Reji)Its almost as if an entire culture is being moved or trundled away by an armoured vehicle. The image does not identify the source of the threat but signifies that by the introduction of the curled hook, says Allana.In another of Rejis works, Fishes Under the Broken Bridge, children are seen at various stages of play in a semi-rural setting framed by coconut palms and hovering seagulls, while in the backdrop a plane crashes seemingly out of nowhere and men, unperturbed, keep standing on a bridge holding up their rods waiting for fish. The picture is rife with a sense of unease  the fishing rods seen from a particular angle seem like raised swords just before a strike.Gigi Scaria, Under the Water (Photo courtesy: Gigi Scaria)Pooja Iranna, Gates to yet another Spectacular World (Photo courtesy: Pooja Iranna)The theme of imminent danger, catastrophe or sudden collapse runs through all the art-works at the exhibition. Pooja Irannas Gates to Yet Another Spectacular World is an installation built with staple pins. As Sawhney writes in the catalogue, she uses the conformity and mundaneness of her material to create a double illusion. Stacked together, individual staples create a formidable sculpture or structure. But should one staple fall out or move out of place, the whole edifice may come apart. This mirrors the tentativeness and the instability of existence, adds Allana.Sumedh Rajendrans mixed media collage on grey, robotic workers marching to office as if they were soldiers, add another strand  that of precarity of urban existence  to the exhibition. Some of them are torso-less and headless and yet they seem to move automaton-like forward; to stop or pause in such circumstances would be unthinkable. The work alludes to the desperate and daily departure of human beings to fixed spaces such as the office, explains Allana.GR Irannas (untitled) work portraying a bundle of old journals with a flower sprouting from a corner is the only image of promise and expectation in this bleak, though striking exhibition. The paper may seem used and discarded but out of the Book of Knowledge springs hope, says Allana. And what can be more symbolic than that?Details: Till March 2, Art Heritage, 205, Tansen Marg, Triveni Kala Sangam. 11 am-7 pm, Sundays closed. Nearest metro station: Mandi House"
5aeb09f19855b73f522c632c,Bengaluru: Veggies get pocket-friendly,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2018/jan/19/bengaluru-veggies-get-pocket-friendly-1758226.html,2018-01-19,,The New Indian Express,"Ashwini M Sripad ByExpress News ServiceBENGALURU: With the supply of vegetables crossing three times the demand, vegetable prices have drastically dropped. Experts say that at least for the next two months the markets are expected to be filled with vegetables costing fraction of their prices prevailing a few days ago. In Karnataka, vegetable growers are more in Kolar, Bengaluru Rural, Chikballapur, Chitradurga, Ramanagara, Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar, Hassan and other places. With good rain this monsoon, growers could get good yield too. The price of many vegetables has come around Rs 20 per kilo which was more than Rs 70 a few months back. While the tomato has declined to Rs 11 per kilo, pumpukin is Rs 13 per kg, raddish is Rs 18, snake gourd is Rs 18, while beetroot and potato are Rs 22 per kg, according to the Horticultural Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS) price list.Former additional director (Fruits), Dr S V Hittalamani, explained that this was because the state witnessed good monsoon rainfall in 2017. The lakes and rivers had filled, and groundwater had charged up.With this, farmers used borewell for water and it was an advantage for vegetable growers to grow larger quantities of vegetables. If there is more supply than demand, naturally the price declines. This is what has happened now, he said.Citing an example, Hittalamani said tomatoes grown on 6,000 hectares of land yielded around one lakh tones of tomatoes. But this year, with more farmers using their land for growing tomatoes, they have used 18,000 hectares of land and grown three lakh tones of tomatoes as compared to last year. If the quantity is thrice, one can imagine the price slash. In winter season, tomatoes normally grow. This year, growers in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra have also grown good quantities of tomatoes. This means there is no demand for our tomatoes in these states, he said.People, vendors happyAruna, a resident of Rajarajeshwarinagar bought carrot, onion, potato, peas, beans, chilies and curry leaves, all half kg to one kg. Even after buying so much, my bill was hardly D100. I was happy to buy veggies this cheap, she said. She said just a couple of months back, she used to spend D250 for the same quantity of vegetables. The vendors too are happy. Carrot was D90 per kg just a couple of months ago, now it has dropped to D45. Similarly, potato was D80 per kg and it has fallen to D22. People do come to buy vegetables even if the price is increased, Rudresh, a vegetable vendor at Vijayanagar said. Another vendor, Mahesh at Shivajinagar, said customers are happy. We too are happy that they are buying more in quantity, he said.From less supply to tomato glutAccording to deputy director of horticulture department Chandrashekar, just a few months ago there was demand for tomatoes as there was less supply. The price of tomatoes had reached D90 per kg. It was then that farmers started growing tomoatoes thinking there would be good price in the market. Tomatoes need three months to grow. There was good rain, that added as an advantage to them. There is good supply and price has naturally come down, he said. In summer, with some virus or the other, the yield of tomatoes will come down, and the price of tomatoes will increase during that time."

However, the night temperature this season has mostly hovered around 7 degrees Celsius, four degrees above normal, while the day temperature has come close to 20 degrees Celsius.The region, extending from Kashmir to Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, has witnessed no snow in the last three months. Rainfall, on the other hand, has been up to 100% deficient. As apples are a rain or snow-fed crop, this development has caused much concern among cultivators.A dry apple farm in Himachal Pradesh. (HT File Photo)The planting of apple saplings  which is usually done when the soil is rich with moisture  have been delayed, and the infusion of fertilisers in the soil has been poor. For the first time in 20 years, we did not witness any rain or snow through December and January. So far, the region has seen only 300 chilling hours, bemoaned Balwant Chauhan, an apple grower from Rohru.Prem Chandra Sharma, a 68-year-old farmer from Hatal Sainj village in Uttarakhand, also predicted difficult times ahead.According to experts, the warm winter may also impact the production of other crops  including pears, apricots, green almonds, tomatoes, cabbage and cauliflower. Such weather conditions will hit apple production adversely as Himachals orchards depend completely on rainfall. Moisture is a must for cultivation of fruits, said horticulturist SP Bhardwaj.Apple economicsApple constitutes 90% of the fruit crop in Himachal and Kashmir, and is the main source of livelihood for people from seven out of 12 districts in Himachal and nine out of 14 districts in Kashmir.Himachal witnessed a record production of 892 metric tonnes of apples in 2010-11, but plummeted to 275 metric tonnes the very next year. Ever since, it has shown no sign of recovering.Kashmir also witnessed a drop in production in recent years with overall temperatures rising across the Himalayan region.The dry weather may also impact rabi crop cultivation in the hills. The drought-like situation is likely to hit wheat production, said Himachal Pradesh agriculture department director Dr Des Raj Sharma.Meanwhile, the governments of these states are looking at alternative measures to alleviate the situation. JC Sharma, principal secretary of the Himachal Pradesh horticulture department, said the government was trying to make up for the lack of rainfall by setting up irrigation infrastructure and root stock plantations under a World Bank project.Uttarakhand agriculture minister Subodh Uniyal, on the other hand, said the state government will prepare a report on losses incurred by farmers on the basis of district-level inputs.Other sectorsThe absence of snowfall has affected tourism in the region too, with visitors staying away from their winter hotspots.We have no choice but to wait for the snow to rev up the season, complained Nishant Sharma, a Himachal-based tours and travel operator.Manali Hoteliers Association president Gajender Thakur had a similar tale of woe to relate. Many tourists cancelled their bookings after they realised there would be no snowfall in the coming week, he said.The situation wasnt much better in neighbouring Uttarakhand either. The international winter skiing championship, scheduled to be held at Auli from January 16, has been deferred by a month.Met forecastThe India Meteorological Department (IMD), however, has promised rainfall and snow from January 22.Global warming may be giving rise to warmer winters, but regional factors like western disturbances and the El Nino also impact temperatures, said IMD (Delhi) official DS Pai.Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist at the Skymet Weather Services, said this winter was warmer due to lack of active western disturbances that cause snowfall. The western disturbances that impacted the Himalayas this time were not strong enough to cause precipitation in the northern states. However, they did disrupt the flow of cold northwesterly winds, making temperatures in the Indo-Gangetic plain plummet, he said.Twelve of the 15 warmest years recorded in India occurred between 2001 and 2016, in keeping with global weather patterns."

Locals have earned Rs 6 crore by selling tomatoes and cauliflowers that they grow in plenty.Steps would be initiated to promote agriculture tourism to check migration. We plan to organise fairs like ginger fair, pomegranate fair, apple fair to attract tourists. The fairs will be organised by horticulturists and farmers in areas where they get bumper crops.Besides, the tourism department would boost income of the people in rural areas by promoting programmes such as eco-tourism and home stay facilities. It will help attract foreign tourists to rural areas in the state. Similarly, programmes like Mera Gaon, Mera Teerth which the Parishad has been organising to pave the way for reverse migration would be replicated elsewhere.Parishad general secretary Ramprasad Penuli said a large number of the people from Pahari diaspora who left their villages long ago for various reasons have started participating in Gramotsava. They not only participate in these religious fairs but also contribute towards development of their ancestral villages.He said the government agreed to promote such programmes because migration is a major problem facing the state.

This is because the state government hasnt fixed any rates for vegetables, Narayana Gowda, one of the farmers in Kolar district, said.Since there is no minimum support price (MSP) for food grains and crops, the pricing of fruits and vegetables is left to the market forces.Narayana Gowda, who is from Hosmatanahalli in Kolar district, said, over `70,000 is spent to grow vegetables in an acre. The cost includes pesticides and other agro-based expenses. We grow and take care of it for three months day and night. But in return, we get pittance. The middlemen are rampant.Now that the supply is more than the demand in the market, the middlemen are purchasing tomato, beans and brinjal for `3 each (per kg), capcicum for `15 and ladies finger for `5 (per kg). We are not getting any profit. Whatever we are getting we are spending it on transporation and also for the coolies at our farms. The coriander leaves are sold at `10 per bundle. One can imagine our plight. Where should we go? he asked.Srinivasa, another farmer demanded that farmers flea market be held at every panchayath or hobli level once a week or fortnight. At least we can go sell our products directly to the consumers, and get some profit. We can also avoid the middlemen, he said.Chennagowda, a farmer who grows tomatoes in Kolar, said tomato price came down to `4 per kilo to `3 a few days ago. In fact, it even went down to `2 last month. We put in a lot of effort to grow it for 100 days, but this is what we get. Every political party leader comes to us before elections with assurances, but nothing is done. If we do not get money, how can we take care of our wives and children,  he said."

Photo: Samar HalarnkarI am a storehouse of what my wife calls useless information. I get withering looks when I tell her which B- or C-lister is dating, whos getting married, what their workouts are and where they vacationed this winter. She has no interest in the fact that the svelte actor who rules the Kannada film industry is, like her, a Sindhi. Shes Galrani, youre Ramani, and you both do yoga, I tell herbut she has already left the room.Oh well.You see, in this breathless era of the smartphone and Twitter, I read five local newspapers, which is where I glean these nuggets. I read the pages that the few people still reading newspapers immediately discardthe city and lifestyle sections. Dominated by lurid gossip and paid-for puff publicity, these pages often have realalbeit badly writtenlocal news.Thats how I knewwhile reading the Deccan Herald city section at the doctorsthat the annual avarebele mela was on, a street-food festival based on a single bean, the avarekai, avarekalu or avarebele, Kannada words for the hyacinth or field bean.Bengaluru is known for its festivals celebrating agricultural products. These fairs offer relaxed markets where farmers, traders and city slickers mingle. We have an annual kadalekai parishe, or peanut fair, and last week, while running through the citys sprawling Cubbon Park, I dodged enthusiasts thronging a millets fair and millets marathonthe agriculture minister, whose trim frame betrays a proclivity to fitness, enthusiastically participated in the latter.My wife, who always persuades me to patronize the local Ramzan and Christmas festivitieswhich she can appreciate through only sight and soundhas always wanted to indulge her own culinary tastes, which are vegetarian and appreciative of local farmers and traditions. The problem is the bean and peanut festivals are across town, and given my reluctance to engage with Bengalurus formidable traffic, we had not been there.One bright winter morning, I bundled her into an autorickshaw and off we went to Sajjan Rao Circle in VV Puram, where old traditions, homes and trees linger. This is a vegetarian Kannadiga stronghold, and that is evident in the meat-free offerings on thindi beedi, or food street, a 100m stretch of carts, small eateries and condiment stores. One of these, Sri Vasavi Condiments, organizes the annual avarebele mela that focuses entirely on a green-and-white broad bean, made with skin or without. The bean is particularly appropriate for a city that is often called bean town in the English translation from one of its supposed root names, bende kaal ooru, or town/village of boiled beans (although this is likely bunkum).Everything at the fair was about the avare bean, and nothing was costlier than Rs60. The avarebele was mixed with dosa, idli and bonda batters; worked into curries, ragi and rice rotis; blended with pulaos, upmas, payasams and evengreenhoney jalebis. Oh, how could I forget the union of north and south, the avarebele rumali roti, and, of course, that pinnacle of fusion, avarebele manchurian. I daresay no other festival boasts of the wild experimentation of the green bean soire, although I refused to experiment with the last two. We jostled around the coupon issuers, grabbed our precious tokens and waved them frantically at the chefs until we got, on leaf plates, our avarebele dosa with hithkabeleor beans without skinsaru (curry), avarebele ragi roti and avarebele idlis. We packed avarebele chikki, spiced hithkabele snacks and raw beans and plunged into the midday traffic to make our way back home.The next day, I cooked the beans and tossed them with some sea salt, hoping to create my own avarebele entre. The first thing I did was to integrate them with our daily dosa, as you can see in the recipe below. I think the Sri Vasavi Condiments dosa was made from beans with the skinavarelebe dosa, while mine was hithkabele, without the skin.I was happy to have finally made the long-pending journey to the mela. The avarebele has been a gap in my acquaintance with state tradition; about 90% of the southern crop comes from Karnataka. I have eaten the basic curry now and then, but I was not acquainted with the beans diverse uses. The avarebele is nutritious, packed as it is with vitamins and iron, and it is a particularly important source of protein for vegetarians. In Bengaluru, even those who dont eat iteven in my homeapparently know of the great, green bean.After we returned home the day of the fair, I was telling my pork-eating seven-year-old of our trip and how we had eaten all manner of delicious food made with green-and-white beans; you know, I told her, the same beans we sometimes pick up from Cubbon Park when we go cycling. Oh, she said, you mean avarekai.Hithkabele DosaMakes 4IngredientsBatter to make four dosas1 cup of peeled hyacinth beans (hithkabele)2 tbsp onion, chopped1/2 green chilli, chopped finely1 tbsp coriander, chopped finely1 tbsp tomato, chopped finelySea salt to taste1/2 tsp gheeMethodPlace the beans in a pressure-cooker steamer with water below.

Being a Bengali, food is forms an integral part of my life. I was never a ghar ka khana person, but always a bahar ka khana! she laughs. After a decade in corporate, she decided to don a chef s cap. She missed international cuisine when she got back home. So, I would Google recipes, hunt for ingredients across the city or sometimes go to Delhi to get it! I loved throwing parties, and cook food! I enjoyed the whole process of planning the menu and cooking, she says. But eating at the famous Massana Restaurant a Michelin starred restaurant in Girona, Spain, sealed the deal.That food made such a huge impact on me  the presentation, hospitality, taste  it was like nothing Ive ever experienced anywhere else, she gushes. She decided that she wanted to create such a memorable impact on other people. She visited the kitchens of a chef she knew at the Country Inn and Sweets and learned to chop, shred, and other nuances for the next four months. The first time, I walked in with my kitchen knife, the whole kitchen laughed! she recalls. That was the first time she chopped with a large cleaver, and she had to chop small pieces of garlic. After that, she did several culinary courses in French cooking, a duck master class in Australia and catering for private events. And when she got back to India, she received a casting call for MasterChef India! It was out of the blue, I cant believe I went to the Top 30! she recalls, and though she was heartbroken that she didnt continue, she trained under world-class chefs like Ornella De Felice, celebrity chef from Top Chef Italy and head chef at the restaurant Coromandel. Youre 36, and had everything but suddenly youre starting afresh! But I have no complaints. I loved that experience so much! I have an excellent family in Rome  I can get a couch there anytime I go! she laughs.According to her, fine dining is not necessarily cooking with truffles and caviar or decorating with a beetroot or carrot rose, but is all about techniques and simple ingredients that are seasonal and local, which she says is healthier and tastier. You get fresh stuff from local vegetable vendors she advises. Though she is trained in Italian, Mediterranean and Spanish cuisines, she calls herself an ingredient based cook. Even for this pop-up, we are using local ingredients like baby potatoes, fresh tomatoes  the menu also has a kulfi and rasmalai inspired pannacotta!. Each plate is designed to have flavours from different cuisines  a deconstructed salad has French, Chinese and Italian elements. Anuroopa is excited to be back in Chennai. I did my class 8 here, and lived in Adyar opposite the Adyar Bakery! she laughs. She has fond memories of eating at the Chola Sheraton, Mysorepak and murukkus from Grand Sweets.I love Chettinad food...I dont know why the world doesnt know about it yet. Indian food is not just butter chicken, you know! Does she dream of owning a restaurant? Of course, eventually. Right now I want to learn from the best, she concedes, adding that she is looking forward to doing more pop-ups around the country, while working in the best kitchens across the world. Later next month, I will be interning at one of the worlds Top 10 restaurants. People would die to get an opportunity there! People exit the kitchen at my age, and here I am entering one of the best in the world! she laughs."

This graduate of National Institute of Fashion Technology moved to Bengaluru after marriage and worked as a brand consultant for some of the top companies.Urban life, family responsibilities, job and the culture of small apartments made it impossible for her to employ her gardening skills effectively and, as a result, she could grow only a few herbs in her balcony.Forty four-year-old Anamika had always dreamt of having her own garden, where she could grow varieties of fruits and vegetables too along with her herbs. Then, one day, she was shaken when her daughter told her innocently that she thought fruits and vegetables came from supermarkets.This disconnect motivated Anamika to open a start-up called Village Story, through which she organises experiential farming for children and their families. Her friend offered her an acre of land to run this.Within six months, Anamika succeeded in growing vegetables and herbs such as zucchini, broccoli, edamame, cucumber, lettuce, cherry tomatoes, okra, eggplant, beans, born, rocket leaves, spinach, fenugreek, coriander, mint, carrot, millet, butternut squash, radish and capsicum.Anamika says that her father-in-law, who owns a nursery, farmland and orchard in Dehradun, is her inspiration.She shares about her startup: Almost now 15 to 20 families are part of our Farmville/Kitchen Garden; they are extremely thrilled that they have their own green patch where they can grow their own greens. They love coming here with family and friends. They sow, grow, harvest, taste and share. They feel its an amazing outdoor family activity for them, from where they take home an experience and joy of growing their own food.

An Australian delegation visited the governments centre of excellence at Bassi in Jaipur district recently to study the prospects of introducing the technique in the state.Soon, the Australian government will send a formal proposal for sharing this technique with Rajasthan, after which the work will start, said Prabu Lal Saini, the state agriculture minister.Hydroponics is a method to grow plants without soil, using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent.The three-member delegation, including South Australian governments investment manager (Indian trade) Rahul Ranjan and Australian firm Ironwoods chief consultant Mark Cody, studied the site and infrastructure at the centre for two days beginning January 11.Saini said that hydroponics technique would be used in the farming of tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, cucumber (kheera) and coloured capsicum. The farming of these vegetables will be done in 4,000 square metre area in Bassi. Use of the technique would increase the yields manyfolds, he said.Generally, yield per plant of tomato in three months is around half a kg and when grown in poly house the yield increases to 5-6kg per plant in six months, but through the hydroponics technique, the yield per plant will increase to around 65-70kg per plant in 10 months. Similarly, yield of coloured capsicum and cucumber is around 4kg per plant, which will increase by six times to 24kg per plant, he informed. Such innovations will help in doubling the income of farmers, he added.The crop will be grown vertically to accommodate more plants in the same area, thus increasing the yield. More production of vegetables will help in curbing hike in prices and common man can get quality vegetables at affordable prices, he said.Once it is started at Bassi, hydroponics will be propagated to farmers in the state, he said. Even during these two years of pilot move, an Indian version of hydroponics technique will be developed so that farmers can afford it, he added.The agriculture department has sanctioned 13 crore for the two-year project starting from June this year. Saini said the department has constituted a committee to speed up the project. The project will be supervised by Rajasthan Olive Cultivation Limited (ROCL)."

(Source: Thinkstock images) Representative Image. (Source: Thinkstock images)They say bigger is better, but in the succulent world of cherry tomatoes, one Israeli company is going smaller than ever before. The drop tomato is about the size of a blueberry and the Kedma company in the countrys southern Arava desert says it is the smallest one ever cultivated in Israel, perhaps even in the world, reports news agency AP. Its a point of pride in a country known for its agricultural innovation, where fruits and vegetables are taken seriously and where several strands of the cherry tomato were first invented.The idea is that it is comfortable, said Ariel Kidron, a Kedma grower. You can throw it in a salad, you dont need to cut it. It just explodes in your mouth. The seed, originally developed in Holland, was modified to match the arid growing conditions in southern Israel. Rami Golan, of the Central and Northern Arava Research and Development center, who accompanied the project, said it was definitely the smallest ever to be grown in Israel where tomatoes are incredibly popular.The tiny tomato, smaller than a one shekel Israeli coin, is offered in red and yellow varieties and will be presented to the public at a three-day international agricultural fair in Israel later this month. Early indications are it could be a big hit. Shaul Ben Aderet, a well-known Israeli chef who owns three restaurants, including Tel Avivs Blue Rooster, got some early samples and says the new strand is packed with flavor and will spawn an infinite number of new recipes. He offered it sizzled in a pan, baked into focaccia bread and as a straight-up snack.Its very simple, its clean, its nice, its sexy, he said. In a blind taste test alongside two sweets, he said, they would say the tomato is a candy, thats for sure.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Of the 99 major and medium irrigation projects identified for completion by 2019 through the LTIF, not more than 10 have been completed so far.The year 2017 has been a great one for the BJP, politically. Under the leadership of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, the party has scaled new heights by wresting Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Manipur, retaining Goa and Gujarat, and luring Bihar into its fold. The only minor setback was Punjab, where the Akalis and BJP lost. The party now rules in 19 states, either on its own or as a dominant partner of the NDA. More than two-thirds of Indians live in these states and this is, perhaps, the best opportunity for the Modi government to carry out agriculture reforms in a synchronised manner, at least in these 19 states. Remember, agriculture is a state subject in the Constitution, and this sector has remained somewhat neglected in the reform process since 1991. This is PM Modis moment. If he can reform agriculture, he can not only distinguish the NDAs policies from UPA-type reforms, but also establish himself as a leader of the masses. This will pay handsome dividends in 2019.It is not a secret any more that farmers have suffered during the last three-and-a-half years of the Modi government, first from two successive droughts and then from tumbling agri-prices. In the first four years of the Modi government, agri-GDP is going to register an average annual growth rate of around 2 per cent, which is almost half of what was achieved during the 10 years of UPA rule. So, without lifting its performance, and the incomes of farmers, it will not be feasible to achieve either sabka sath, sabka vikas or doubling farmers incomes by 2022, as has been promised by the prime minister.As one looks back at 2017 with an agri-lens, one finds it a puzzling and painful year for farmers. The monsoon was reasonably good, and so was kharif production. Still, several states saw farmers agitations triggered primarily by very low prices for their produce, be it onions, potatoes, pulses, oilseeds or cotton. The profitability of major kharif crops for major producing states, based on market prices and projected costs estimated by the CACP, has gone down dramatically to less than 5 per cent or negative in kharif 2017 (see graph). This has to be measured against the promise of 50 per cent profit over costs, as mentioned in the BJPs 2014 poll manifesto.The worst, however, happened in Madhya Pradesh, where the farmers agitation became violent and many farmers died in the ensuing police firing. This led to a knee-jerk reaction in policies, from farm loan waivers in many states to a drastic increase in import duties on pulses and edible oils.Earlier, the Union budget for 2017-18 had also announced several measures for farmers. For example, the augmentation of the Long Term Irrigation Fund (LTIF) with NABARD by Rs 20,000 crore taking its total to Rs 40,000 crore; the micro-irrigation fund of Rs 5,000 crore, and the dairy development fund of Rs 8,000 crore, all with NABARD. A model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2017, was also circulated later. But what has been the progress so far? Very little. Of the 99 major and medium irrigation projects identified for completion by 2019 through the LTIF, not more than 10 have been completed so far and that too many without field channels. The micro-irrigation fund has not taken off yet, and the dairy fund was approved just a few days ago. No wonder, with such a lacklustre performance, one cannot expect much improvement in agriculture or farmers incomes.Now, under duress, MP is undergoing a pilot price deficiency payment scheme under which the difference between MSP and modal prices of eight notified commodities is to be paid directly to farmers. The jury is still out on the projects performance but at this stage it is clear that it suppressed market prices further, especially of urad, creating a crisis for urad farmers.In case of trade policy, the government seems to have finally woken up to dovetail it with MSP policy and, accordingly, raised import duties significantly on pulses and edible oils ensuring that the landed prices of these are not below their respective MSPs. Better late than never!What can be done now as one treads into 2018?First, expedite the implementation of major flagship programmes by removing glitches, especially in crop insurance (PMFBY), irrigation (LTIF and micro-irrigation), and the dairy development fund. Second, ensure an effective monitoring and dovetailing of agri-trade and tariff policy with MSP policy through a sub-committee of the Cabinet to take quick decisions. Third, give high priority to agri-marketing reforms to create a seamless movement of agri-produce all over India. Dont hesitate to admit, and correct, the fact that so far e-NAM has not delivered and will not do so unless the basics of agri-marketing from assaying, grading, storage, to dispute settlement are put on track. A major impetus needs to be given to link farmer producer organisations (FPOs) to agri-markets through Operation Veggies TOP (tomatoes, onions and potatoes) on the lines of Operation Flood in milk, linking FPOs to processors and organised retailers, bypassing the mandi system. NABARD has more than 2,000 FPOs and SFAC has created about 700 FPOs. A beginning can be made with them. With experience, this model can be scaled up to other fruit and vegetables.If the Modi government can do this, it can certainly improve farmers economic condition, who in turn will also reward the BJP in 2019. This is good economics and good politics, something PM Modi can sense well.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The genesis of the strike was in Puntamba village, in Rahata taluka of Ahmednagar, where villagers had passed a resolution in the Gram Sabha and called for a strike. The strike later gained steam as thousands of farmers from across the state joined it.Various farmers groups from the state, which had played a crucial role in the strike last year, have decided to stay away from the nation-wide farmers strike that is scheduled to start on June 1. The strike has been called by the All India Kisan Sabha. Shivkumar Sharma, convenor of the Sabha, has asked farmers to ensure that supply of milk and fresh produce to 40 major cities are disrupted as that, he said, will force the government to accept their demands.The farmers demands include proper implementation of the M S Swaminathan Committees recommendations as well as a complete loan waiver.However, days before the strike, farmers groups from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune have declared that they will not participate in the strike. Deepak Bhise, president of the Junnar District Tomato Growers Association, said such strikes cause even more financial losses to farmers. Last year, farmers had incurred heavy losses due to the strike, which was sabotaged by some so-called leaders we do not wish to repeat our losses, he said.ALSO READ | High procurement of crop means little to farmers: Yogendra YadavMost farmers in Maharashtra were waiting for the monsoon to begin their sowing operations, said Bhise.Hansraj Wadghule, a leader of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana from Nashik, said they will not participate in the strike. More than 3,000 cases were filed against farmers last year and they are yet to be withdrawn. We do not wish to involve farmers in this years strike, he said.During Shetkari Sampa, the seven-day strike last year, farmers had stopped supplying milk and vegetables to urban markets. However, within a day of the strike, a section of farmer leaders had tried to call it off after late-night talks with the government. Farmers from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune refused to call it off and eventually, the government agreed to the demands of the farmers and announced a Rs 30,000-crore loan waiver.The genesis of the strike was in Puntamba village, in Rahata taluka of Ahmednagar, where villagers had passed a resolution in the Gram Sabha and called for a strike.

This price is recovered from the farmers.As fuel prices rise by the day, experts have hinted that a similar upward trend is likely to be seen in the prices of everyday essentials. Prices of vegetables, which have remained steady throughout the summer, might see a 20-25 per cent rise if fuel price rise continues.At Pune and Pimpris wholesale markets, most of the vegetables have remained between the price range of Rs 10 and 40 per kg. A glut in production, as a result of almost 10 per cent increase in the area of production across the state, has resulted in the collapse of prices.Vegetables such as green peas, cauliflower, cabbage, carrot, et cetera are mostly trading in the range of Rs 10-15 per kg, which, traders said, is because of healthy arrivals. Tomato, in most wholesale markets, is trading at Rs 5-8 per kg, while in the retail markets the prices are about Rs 10-15 per kg. Onion prices, too, are at an all-time low, as a production glut has tilted the demand-supply ratio. However, as diesel prices are touching an all-time high, traders fear an imminent rise in the prices of vegetables.Vilas Bhujbal, president of the Traders and Commission Agents Association of Punes Gultekdi market, said the transporters have not taken the decision to increase prices as they were hopeful of a quick correction in the prices. However, if the present trend continues, a sharp increase in prices is likely, he said. Transporters act as a conduit between farmers and wholesale markets like Pune, to ferry perishable commodities like vegetables. Normally, these are village-level entrepreneurs who charge farmers per crate or per kg to transport their ware. For a market like Pune, transporters bring produce from neighbouring districts as well as from states like Karnataka, Kerala etc.At present, transport charges range between Rs 10 and 40 per kg, depending on the distance. This price is recovered from the farmers. Bhujbal said if fuel prices continue to rise, the transport charges may increase by 10-15 per cent immediately. This will effect the prices in the wholesale markets and, subsequently, the retail customer will get vegetables at a higher rate, he said. However, many growers said transporters have already effected a rise at their end.Deepak Bhise, president of the Tomato Growers Association of Junnar taluka in Pune district, said wholesale prices have but collapsed. As farmers, we have to use diesel for our tractors, our machines run on diesel. So, this is pinching us hard, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Express Photo By Partha Paul Prices had skyrocketed after July last year as supply was severely hit in the face of low availability of the produce. Express Photo By Partha PaulTomato growers are reeling from heavy losses, hit by low exports and higher produce as the vegetable is cultivated on more areas than before.Tomato exports slumped in 2017-18 with India recording exports worth only Rs 107.21 crore compared to Rs 548.15 crore in 2016-17. Exports to Pakistan and Bangladesh, major destinations for Indian tomatoes, were especially hit. Last year, just about Rs 34 lakh worth of tomatoes were exported to Pakistan compared to Rs 368.45 crore in 2016-17. Exports to Bangladesh last year were just Rs 4.8 crore compared to Rs 66.69 crore in 2016-17.Political tension between India and Pakistan led to the suspension of exports via land to Pakistan last year. Exports to Bangladesh were hit after it increased the import duty on agricultural products to an whopping 48 per cent. In Maharashtra, Junnar taluka and neighbouring areas in Pune district are the major growers of rabi tomato, which feeds the markets from March till August. After that, tomatoes from Niphad, Satana and other areas in Nashik district feed the market and stay till around February.Prices had skyrocketed after July last year as supply was severely hit in the face of low availability of the produce. Farmers in Junnar had stopped using fertilisers and insecticides after March due to lower realisations. The wholesale market at Narayangaon in Junnar and at Pimpalgaon in Nashik are the major tomato markets for rabi and karif crops respectively.This year, Junnar farmers had failed to recover their expenses as till about late May they had to sell the vegetable at Rs 2-3 per kg. Traders had blamed the suspension of trade with Pakistan and Bangladesh for the bloodbath in the wholesale markets. Besides, instead of the customary 30,000 acres of plantation, this year Junnar and its neighbouring area had seen tomato cultivation on over 40,000 acres.The spectre of low prices looms large even as the state stares at another bumper cultivation for the kharif crop.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

They dont enrol their children in schools. They spend their earnings on liquor. Liquor is a bad thing, I have been saying this for 15 years.The minister was away to Jaunpur to attend a wedding when tomatoes and eggs were hurled at his residence on Saturday afternoon.The police rushed to the spot and chased the youths away. However, no FIR was lodged.The minister said: I will take up the matter with the government. This is a case of breach of security in the high-security area. Who knows if they hurl bombs tomorrow? Such a thing has happened where the CM lives close by. A campaign should be run against liquor.Earlier, Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh reacted to Rajbhars comment and tweeted: Why only liquor. A campaign should also be run against Ganja-chillam, taadi (toddy), tobacco, charas, opium, and arrogance as well.Rajbhar has courted controversy earlier with his criticism of the performance of the Yogi Adityanath government in the state.In another controversial comment on drinking, he had said, If someone offers you liquor, consume it but vote as per you discretion."

Instead, they convert it into manure for a terrace garden.The residents of Matoshree Pearl, a 22-storey building with 65 flats, have been treating their collective biodegradable kitchen waste within the society premises using two bio-composter tumblers with a capacity of 10 kg each that produce nutrient-rich manure.The society generates 30kg wet waste per day, and since October 2 last year when they began the project, residents estimate that they have helped the municipal corporation avoid the transport of 6,300kg of kitchen waste to the dumping grounds. That waste has instead been used to produce 800kg of manure.Considering we are not a very large society and we do not fall under the specifications of the waste management rules to treat waste at source, we have still ended up doing it, as our vision is to be a green society and ensure we give something back to nature, said Satish Kini, managing committee member and resident in-charge of various green efforts at the society. In a city like Mumbai, which is facing both air and water pollution, we want to make our society a green haven for our children and senior citizens.Additionally, the society has diverted 2,200 kg of their dry waste since October from going to the landfills by segregating it and recycling. Only biomedical and non-recyclable waste is being collected by the civic body.In August last year, the residents reached out to Are you Reducing, Reusing, Recycling- RUR Greenlife, a social environment organisation, responsible for many similar projects across the city. After a series of workshops by the organisation, the residents began their decentralized and sustainable waste management within two months.Matroshree Pearl is an inspiring model green society, which has active enthusiastic participation by all residents towards care for the environment. It gives us hope for a greener future, said Monisha Narke, founder and CEO, RUR Greenlife.The society adopted a three-bin approach to segregation of biodegradable; dry recyclable and non-recyclable waste by using colour-coded bins and garbage bags to ensure higher level of segregation. The dry waste is further segregated through a seven bin approach into - cardboard, paper, plastic bottles, electronic waste, metal, glass, and tetrapak cartons. Residents sell some of the reusable dry waste to rag pickers and other recyclers for a nominal fee. The revenue generated from dry waste recycling is used to support the kitchen waste management project which making the activity a self-sufficient project, said Kini.November onward, the 4,000sqft terrace of the building was made home to an organic garden where residents grow spinach, cucumber, tomatoes, chili, ladyfinger, fenugreek, lemon grass and many other vegetables. Children from the society have been given a vegetable patch each and they are responsible for nurturing them.We have set up a drip irrigation system which uniformly provides water to each of these plantations, said Shireesh Kedare, resident and professor, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B).This is one society which has made best use of the circular economy model and benefitted the most out of it. More than helping to ease the burden from landfills, this model makes a society self-sufficient. Our focus currently is to inculcate this attitude in more societies, which will give them incentive to adopt waste management at source, said Chandrakant Tambe, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporations solid waste management department."

Of the 125 lakh tonnes of wheat procured in the state during the current season so far, 65 lakh tonnes are being stored in the open.In technical terms, it is called covered at plinths (CAP) storage, which is a great cause of concern for the state government. The wheat stored in open is exposed to the vagaries of weather, and has shorter life. But what makes it worse are the piling up stocks of grains.There are 25 lakh tonnes of wheat of the previous season and officials in the Food Corporation of India (FCI), the central body that runs nationwide public distribution system, say the state will have a backlog of wheat of one full season (at least 125 lakh tonnes), hinting at tougher days ahead for the states food and civil supplies department.Besides, some more wheat of the current season is expected to arrive in the mandis. The state godowns also have 100 lakh tonnes of rice.Must read | Tomato prices crash in Punjab, Haryana due to bulk suppliesState procurement agencies have witnessed the second highest arrival of wheat this year after 2012-13 when 130 lakh tonnes of wheat was procured. Officials of state food agencies said such a pile-up in the CAP storage was not witnessed for the past five years.Another worrying factor is the fall in the monthly movement of foodgrains (wheat and rice) from the state, from an average of 18 lakh tonnes in the previous year (2016-17) to 15 lakh tonnes in the (2017-18) current year.Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are no longer consumer states and they have become self-sufficient in foodgrains. Also, Madhya Pradesh is now contributing to the national pool, said an FCI official, on the condition of anonymity.Besides, Haryana is expected to contribute additional 10 lakh tonned of foodgrains into national kitty this year (a total of 85 lakh tonnes as against 75 lakh tonnes in the previous year), which will cut down the demand for Punjab wheat, he added.Punjab has a covered storage space (godowns) capacity of 152 lakh tonnes for both rice and wheat, and 4.75 lakh tonne capacity in steel silos for wheat storage. This entire space is already full, according to officials.We are prevailing upon the FCI to make movement of foodgrains faster. If the quality of grains gets affected due to CAP storage, Punjab will be at a loss, said state principal secretary, food and civil supplies, KAP Sinha.The FCI official suggested that the state could easily store 30 lakh tonnes of freshly procured wheat in CAP storage to save covered storage space, as it would cut infrastructure cost to one-third.30 lakh tonnes of wheat kept from April to September in CAP storage would move out easily, he said."

Im talking about the intricate web of lanes running from the square opposite the Venetian Gothic-styled David Sassoon library behind Rampart Row all the way to Flora Fountain on one end and Horniman Circle at the other.For what its worth, Kala Ghoda was always a hub for culture and art. Flanked by a museum, many art galleries, a foreign cultural mission, a historical synagogue and erstwhile home to two of Mumbais iconic restaurants. Samovar, tucked inside the Jehangir art gallery, and Wayside Inn, wrapped around the corner next to Rhythm House.Wayside Inn was epochal because it was at Table No 4 that Babasaheb Ambedkar, over hours of passionate persuasions and pots of tea, drafted the Indian Constitution. Its here that struggling progressive artists Husain, Ara and Gaitonde scrounged for toast and eggs, and poets like Arun Kolatkar wrote verses about life, jam and bread. Here that Mohammed Ali Jinnah romanced his Parsi girlfriend over dhansak, and Behram Contractor created his memorable humour column alongside sunny-side-up eggs and bacon. And where a whole generation of post-Independence socialists and intellectuals was bred, over custard and bread pudding.Rampart Row used to be a street full of happening restaurants. All the fun is now inside the lanes. (HT File Photo)I used to love sitting there, watching the rain fall and the brown trees go green, over a mug of beer and plate of mixed grill and onions.Rampart Row used to be a street full of happening restaurants. Wayside Inn has given way to Punjab Grill. Khyber looks a bit lost. Copper Chimney has shifted three buildings to the left, and right above it is Boston Butt. But all the fun is now inside the lanes.It all started with Kala Ghoda Caf. From a small sky-lit space that could seat, at the most, six people and offered free wi-fi, its turned into one of the most influential eateries in that precinct. Its cavernous hall and Bombay black wood furniture are reminiscent of a large dining room in an old Mumbai mansion.At The Pantry, ingredients come from artisanal makers all over India. The Quiche Lorraine they do with oodles of cream Gruyere alone is worth the visit. (HT File Photo)The menu is eclectic. Fourteen types of coffee, from macchiato to affogato. Ten kinds of egg, from the Parsi tamota par eedu (eggs on tomato) to omelettes with bacon and feta. There are also three kinds of waffles, two kinds of porridge and muesli. Its an ideal breakfast place. But lunch isnt bad either. You can pick between sandwiches, soups and sali boti, or try the Karnataka black rice risotto with mushrooms.Just off Ropewalk Lane is The Pantry. White, bright and cheerful, they source their ingredients from artisanal makers all over India. Their cheese for example comes from Pondicherry and the Quiche Lorraine they do with oodles of cream Gruyere and ham alone is worth the visit.La Folie is a stylish patisserie. The tiny place looks like a chocolate box itself, with small desserts lined up like little works of art, but its the hot chocolate that takes me there.At Ayub's, the meat is better, the onions fresher, the chutney less watery. To me, its the Michelin star version of Bade Miyan. (HT File Photo)Then theres Nutcracker, a vegetarian place thats cracked the code. Penne, pesto, panini, potato wedges, with peach and ginger iced tea. But the Emmenthal scrambled eggs with truffle oil, and the Mumbai Local sandwich hit the spot for me.A little further away is Plenty. Its not exactly Kala Ghoda, but a short walk towards Horniman Circle. Brick-walled and poignantly coloured, the menu is a mixed bag of all our favourite dishes that remarkably bear an overall demeanour of goodness and health. Even the usually oily, spicy and vinegary Goa sausage, when served alongside a portion of fresh avocado, pickled beetroot and goats cheese on a crisp slice of healthy toast, tastes wonderfully refined here.They have cold bowls and they have hot bowls and the hot bowl I like is the Kerala pepper chicken stew with steamed rice. But my favourite is the pulled pork sandwich  sweet and spicy pork between freshly baked bread. The finale has to be the berry pavlova, meringues in sour berry compote with vanilla cream, lime and pistachio.Watch out for Maska Maarke by Kunal Vijayakar in Hindustan Times, Mumbai, and on hindustantimes.com/mumbai, every Saturday morning.As the office rush recedes and the lanes empty out, as young couples walk hand in hand in the lanes of Kala Ghoda looking for love, and as revelers hunt for a wine, a beer and a song, I am often spotted looking for a hot spicy egg roll, stuffed with boti kebab. Walk past the aqua-coloured Knesset Eliyahoo Synagogue and at the end of VB Gandhi Marg (VB Gandhi is the man who decided that Mumbai cabs should be black and yellow) burns a late night fire. And that fire is from Ayubs.Ayubs the Michelin star version of Bade Miyan. The meat is better, the onions fresher, the chutney less watery and the rolls less soggy. Hot seekh kebab or boti kebab rolls in soft roomali roti, with crunchy onions and chutney. Thats Kala Ghoda for me as well.But the weather right now is too muggy and oppressive to eat hot spicy rolls. Ill wait for the rain to come and wash the streets and trees of Kala Ghoda, because at the moment SoBos Soho stands for So Bloody Hot."

5b13bc499855b76246379fb1,Under pressure,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/under-pressure/article22548146.ece,2018-01-29,,The Hindu,"Amid files, printers and books stands a little pressure cooker. Beside it, theres a bowl of raw chicken. And, in the centre, towering over an induction cooktop set on an office table, stands B Ramakrishnan aka Ramki, who  as always  is in the eye of a storm, and loving it.His enemy du jour is the Instant Pot (IP). A recent story in The New Yorker celebrated Urvashi Pitre, a Dallas-based food blogger, who posted an IP butter chicken recipe, that required 10 minutes of cooking time and got 41,600 shares. The recipe reportedly prompted NRIs to throw out their pressure cookers and replace them with sleeker, programmable IPs.However, in India, Ramki is leading a crusade of his own, encouraging Indians to cook with pressure cookers, using a trademarked technique he calls OPOS (One Pot One Shot.) The community, connected by social media, consists of a Facebook group called OPOS school with more than 13,300 active members and a marginally more relaxed OPOS support group with about 15,500 members.As belligerent as he is bright, Ramki attacked the IP recipe head on, calling on the community to collaborate and create a quicker, easier version with the pressure cooker. They responded with enthusiasm: firing up stoves from Chennai to Dallas. Eleven experiments and four days later, hes cooking up the final six-minute OPOS version in a little office space in Parrys corner, Chennai. He marinates half a kilo of chicken with one spoon each of Kashmiri chilli powder, ginger-garlic paste, dry fenugreek etc. Then, he pours precisely 60 ml of water into a 2-litre pressure cooker, and layers 1/4 cup butter, 1 tsp sugar, chicken and scooped-out tomatoes filled with two tablespoons of almond powder on top. It cooks for six minutes and eight whistles, after which he adds cream and butter.The resulting butter chicken is astonishingly creamy. More importantly, its perfectly cooked. The pressure cooker is faster, greener, lasts a lifetime, costs peanuts to fix and can survive multiple falls, he says, adding wryly, OPOS butter chicken is cooked in the time it takes an instant pot to heat up.An MBA in Marketing and Finance from XLRI in Jamshedpur, Ramki is a restless entrepreneur, constantly on the lookout for the next big idea. More than 10 years ago, he came up with One Page Cookbooks, which broke recipes into building blocks. He started Pizza Republic. But OPOS is clearly his favourite project, even though after eight years of relentless experimentation, he is yet to use it to make money. I feel it would be wrong to keep this information to myself, he says, adding OPOS is constantly shaped by the feedback of thousands of volunteers from over 20 countries.Years ago, the method kicked off so many arguments on a Facebook Food Group that it resulted in Ramki and about 100 other people being kicked out: Much to his delight. I started a group called United By Food, about five years ago. Thats when the experimentation began. We began fine-tuning recipes, burning our way through dishes and blowing up safety valves on a daily basis.One part water becomes 1600 parts of steam when heated. So you need just half a teaspoon of water to cook this, he says, pointing at a cup of beans. If your water dries up, your safety valve might blow. If you put in too much water, theres a build up of steam. The biggest fear is burning, not bursting, he adds, explaining why people should not be afraid of their pressure cookers. It is virtually impossible to blow up. I have been trying to do that for ages. Unsuccessfully!With this system, food is cut and layered according to cooking times and density. Watery veggies at the bottom. Starchy on top so they dont burn. Length doesnt matter: only thickness. Recipes and cooking time are standardised, and newbies are firmly told to stick to the rules. The key is to cook food in its own juices. In the highest possible heat for the lowest possible time.This enables users to put together elaborate meals unbelievably quickly. Six minutes. Thats how long it takes to cook myself lunch. My mother used to take half a day, says Ramki. Of course, there has been the inevitable push back. Chefs and traditionalists tend to be cynical, often resulting in heated online wars. Its hard to have a rational discussion. Either people love me or hate me. A pressure cooker cult? He laughs. I kind of think that is true. It has become a cult. Probably because of my personality...He says his confidence stems from babies. When people started posting that their babies loved OPOS food we knew we were on to something. Baby senses are very acute... Good food is hard-wired into us. He continues, This technique will change food. It will become the only way people cook. It will change every cuisine. Every cookbook.Overly quixotic? Not if you listen to his legion of admirers, who address him as Chef or Sir, and breathlessly follow his every update. Many are housewives once forced to spend hours in the kitchen to please picky in-laws, husbands and children. They talk of OPOS changing their lives by unchaining them from the stove.As for the tough moderators and inflexible rules? OPOS comes with a built-in punishment, Ramki chuckles. The more you veer away from the recipe, the more scrubbing there will be in the end.Deadly much?People used to be afraid to eat tomatoes, thinking them poisonous due to their relation to the belladonna or (deadly nightshade) plant."

I grew up in small-town India and my mother is a gardening enthusiast. So, weve always had gardens, she says.When she set up her own house, she decided to carry forward that gardening tradition, starting with a few pots on the balcony and soon expanding. The pleasure of growing plants is tremendous, she says, admitting that working in her garden gives her a sense of well-being and happiness.She isnt the only one. A 2016 meta-analysis of research conducted by the NCBI concludes that there is, robust evidence for the positive effects of gardening, and that it can, improve physical, psychological, and social health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US, adds that, Gardening can be a great way to enjoy the outdoors, get physical activity, beautify the community, and grow nutritious fruits and vegetables. This is what our team of experts has to say.Plants relax a person, says Kolkata-based psychologist, Mansi Poddar.Which is why, perhaps, there is a specific treatment programme called eco-therapy, that aims to improve mental and physical well-being through a range of outdoor activities, including gardening. It gives people who are depressed a sense of purpose and meaning, says Poddar, pointing out that since it is an activity with an outcome, it makes people feel a sense of achievement and improves their self-esteem. It can also be a great outlet for negative emotions, improves attention and focus, calms an overactive nervous system and helps people who find contact with the world difficult, establish safer and gentler transition into the world, says Poddar.It is also great at relationship building and emotional intelligence. Gardening taps into the part of us that nurtures. And having that sense of warmth and comfort reduces stress, says Poddar. By becoming a community activity that fosters a sense of belonging, it becomes especially useful for older people who often struggle with loneliness. However, it is equally beneficial for children, since it encourages a sense of responsibility and inculcates environmental consciousness. Also, it is also a spiritual activity. I see many people using gardening as a metaphor for life.Gardening helps you stay limber. says Gurugram-based functional fitness and rehab specialist, Vani Pahwa.Its especially important as you age and develop conditions like arthritis and muscular degradation, she says. A spot of light gardening  think weeding, digging, mulching  can help you perform movements like squatting and balancing, naturally. Of course, this is dependent on other factors, including age, body-weight, gender and intensity, but the fact is, any movement counts, says Pahwa, adding that keeping active is especially important for people who dont train regularly.Even seasoned athletes can benefit, of course, by adding in a few sessions of gardening. Constantly performing at a high intensity is detrimental to health, says Pahwa. More importantly, however, gardening helps you connect to nature. You become part and parcel of a life-cycle that gives you emotional satisfaction. This brings in a separate dimension to health, she says.The quality of food grown at home is always superior, says Delhi-based Lovneet Batra, a sports nutritionist. Better water, home-made compost, no lab-made fertilisers, ensure that food grown at home is more flavourful and nutritious. Besides, the less the food has to travel, the less is its carbon footprint. So what could be better than heading out into your balcony to pick up fresh palak, tomatoes or mint?Batra, who herself grows many of her own vegetables, says that easy access to seeds and superior systems like hydroponics, make it very convenient to grow much of your own produce.There is definitely a shift with more people growing their own food, says Batra, adding that this is especially useful for food eaten raw, like salad or cold-pressed juice.Commercial vegetables and fruits are often full of pesticides or injected with chemicals, she says, pointing out that there have been cases of people falling sick after consuming them."

Now they get quality power for eight hours a day with a capital investment of just Rs. 50,000 per unit thanks to the government subsidy of Rs. 4.50 lakh. They also need not go to their farms in the dead of the night as was the practice earlier, say a group of enterprising farmers from Bobbepalli village, tucked away from the Chennai-Kolkata highway.'There is no marketing problem for these vegetables as they have longer shelf life and better freshness, they say in a conversation with The Hindu .The farmers from the village have tied up with traders in the Koyambedu wholesale market in Chennai to market the hybrid vegetables, including carrot, beetroot and onions, tomato grown with the help of solar-powered pumpsets through a network of micro-irrigation system to grow more crop for every drop of water with water soluble fertilizers.On harvesting, we send the vegetables to Chennai, 350 km away and payments are credited online to our bank account on delivery, says a happy farmer D. Srinivasa Rao as he monitors his 30-acre farm on his CCTV.They sell the vegetables locally when prices are almost the same in the Martur market, from where they are marketed by wholesale traders in different parts of the country, adds another farmer J. Haribabu.D. Anjaneyulu, a product of a Business school in Visakhapatnam, has taken to farming as his profession at a time when his peers shied from agriculture in view of the uncertain returns.The returns are very much encouraging. But one has to toil and also do a smart work as well, says the young farmer who has installed a high-value shade net for ensuring ideal agro-climatic condition for improved productivity. They have also adopted water conservation techniques to retain every drop of rain water, adds yet another farmer J. Bullaiah."

The team members also visited the the tomato fields in Ramasamudram, Madanapalle, Nimmanapalle and Palamaner mandals.Peter Hanson, a U.S.-based lead tomato breeder, who headed the team, was accompanied by Agriculture Market Yard (Madanapalle) chairman Ratakonda Gurappa Naidu, translating the versions of farmers for the team on the field. WVC project coordinator, Srikanth Babu, and Scientific Officer J. Karthik recorded the version of tomato growers.Mr. Hanson said the Madanapalle variety was amazing with high quality. I appeal to the farmers of this region to go in for dual purpose tomato breeds intended for both processing industries and domestic needs. Though there is much demand for the processing varieties in India and abroad, the production levels are not encouraging. The World Vegetable Center will play a crucial role in guiding the farmers here in the direction of raising dual purpose crops. This will be quite economical and also profitable, he said, adding the experiments to this extent were giving encouraging results at the labs set up in the four mandals. Soon, the fruits of labs will reach the lands, Mr. Hanson said.Mr. Gurappa Naidu said the World Vegetable Center had been actively involved in raising dual purpose tomato varieties after thorough research into the soil and climatic conditions of the region. He said it was a welcome sign that the horticulture scientists had noted that the Madanapalle variety with a stamina to withstand temperatures as high as 45 degrees C could be developed and promoted as a premier crop, with global recognition."
5b13c89a9855b762ecebf660,Pencils that sprout,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/pencils-that-sprout/article22487973.ece,2018-01-22,,The Hindu,"Did you know over 2,500 wooden pencils can be created from a single tree? And to produce the 15-20 billion pencils needed every year, four lakh trees are cut. Troubled by these alarming statistics, software engineer Divya Shetty, along with friend, Vishnu Vardhan, launched Plantcil in October 2017.Their biodegradable pencils, made with recycled paper and edible food colours, come in many variants: rainbow, velvet, cartoon, seed, and the latest, fruit pencil, was launched last month. We make pencils without cutting down trees, and use only waste newsprint. We have saved 28 trees in the last three months, says Shetty.If you think their pencils are made abroad or shipped from up north, you will be pleasantly surprised to know they are crafted a lot closer to home. At their manufacturing plant at Avinashi (40 kms from Coimbatore), that employs 100 people, over a tonne of waste paper is brought in every month. We make 6,000 pencils a day. There is zero wastage as whatever waste is generated gets recycled and goes back into the production cycle, says Vardhan.All things organicHailing from an agricultural family in Karnataka, Shetty explains why she quit a career in IT to helm two social enterprises. When I was eight, my grandfather committed suicide due to crop failure. I was affected by this incident and always wanted to do something for our farming community, says the 27-year-old, who was working with Vardhan at an IT firm in Bengaluru two years ago.It was in 2015 that she finally decided to make the switch, and launched Indian Superheroes, a social enterprise aimed at introducing people to organic and zero-waste farming, and the rent-a-farm concept  along with Vardhan.For the first two years, they worked on getting farmers together, and convincing them to make the switch to organic. We brought in 12 NGOs and self-help groups who taught them the benefits of organic farming and how to market their products, says Vardhan. In 2017, they launched an online portal, indianorganic.store: they tied-up with over 800 farmers who could sell their produce directly to consumers.Fruity flavoursDuring her interactions with farmers, Shetty says, she learnt that deforestation is the primary reason we are facing a water crisis today, and how the water-intensive pencil industry plays a huge role in this. Thats when we decided to make sustainable pencils inspired by all things natural, she says. They kick-started Plantcil in a rather innovative way. Rather than source paper from scarp dealers, they started collecting old newspapers from schools in the city and, in turn, provided them with a monthly supply of pencils. We realised that by approaching schools, children are introduced to sustainable living early on, says Vardhan.As the concept of plantable stationery began a few years ago with independent Indian and Chinese brands, Shetty and Vardhan constantly brainstorm for fresh ideas and work closely with their design team. Once provided with a basic sketch for a pencil, the team works on the specific size and shape.The classic pencils have Indian ethnic prints on them and the seed pencils have plant seeds at their non-writing tip. We procure native seeds like chilli, spinach, beans, tomatoes and brinjal directly from farmers. Students can plant the pencil and water it. In a few days, a new plant sprouts to life from it, says Shetty. The rainbow pencils are unique as the shavings are multicoloured and ideal for craft. An attempt at teaching children about the colours and aromas of fruits, their latest range of fruit pencils come in different flavours: pineapple, orange, green apple, cocoa, mixed fruit and pista. We source fruits directly from farmers in the region and the extracts give the pencils their aroma. They are made-to-order as the extraction process takes a week and the extracts cannot be stored for too long, she says.Up nextThey are now working on seed pens, all set to launch shortly. Costing Rs. 7 each, at present the nib and refill is made with plastic, with a cardboard body. They are now researching on how to make it a 100% eco-friendly pen using recycled paper.Plans are also in place to launch an app, Farm Zeal, next month. It is aimed at educating people about organic farming. We will be putting up announcements for workshops and gardening activities for children. There will also be an option for people to rent a portion of land to implement what they learn, says Shetty, who believes there is a growing market for all things organic and is looking at retailing her pencils in Maharashtra, Bengaluru and Chennai.The pencils can also be customised with a companys name, and start at Rs. 6 a piece. Available at Sapna Book House, RS Puram in Coimbatore, Nilgiris supermarket in Puducherry, and online at plantcil.com.Deforestation is the primary reason we are facing a water crisis today, and the water-intensive pencil industry plays a huge role in thi"
5b13ce969855b762ecebf9b3,In Odisha  schools are the dropouts,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/in-odisha-schools-are-the-dropouts/article22476577.ece,2018-01-20,,The Hindu,"Doors closed:In contrast to the government schools in villages, which have been running short of students, many of the residential schools are overcrowded. Shadin Menaka (sitting), a physically challenged tribal student, dropped out after the Sana Raisingh primary school closed down.Biswaranjan RoutBiswaranjan RoutIts a little past four in the afternoon, the time when schools ring their closing bells in the Hatsesikhal cluster of Odishas tribal-dominated Rayagada district. Just before Sekhal Primary School comes into view, a couple of students in blue uniforms cycle past on the concrete road that cuts through palm tree cultivations and paddy fields.Along the highway that connects the area to the district headquarters 15 km away are rows and rows of eucalyptus trees that feed JK Paper Mills manufacturing unit in the district.This particular school has been running since 1926. In 1987, it became a 40-seat residential school. As we enter the premises, students are busy sweeping the yard and classrooms. Some are watering the grounds with mugs filled from a large drum placed near a row of dysfunctional toilets.Hobsons choiceAt 81, the number of enrolled children is double the sanctioned strength. All the students in its hostel belong to the villages located in the four or five Gram Panchayats in the area. The schools apparent popularity is not due to its exceptional facilities. For most students, the fact that there are three teachers in this school, and they get three meals a day, makes up for the visible lack of infrastructure: three overcrowded classrooms for five classes, no dining hall or toilets, and a small row of damaged and abandoned rooms gaping at them dismally. But how could they possibly complain? The alternative  to stay on in their village schools  is far worse, and in any case about to disappear.Hostel superintendent Rabindra Kumar Majhi allows two Class 4 students, Santha Mandagi and Siddhanta Melaka, to accompany us to Ranaguda village, which is just a few kilometres away but not easy to access because of the Nagavali, one of southern Odishas major rivers that originates in Kalahandi district and flows into neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.As we wade gingerly across to the other bank, we realise we would be lost without the boys. Ranaguda is a 35-household Kondh tribe hamlet a couple of kilometres from the river. It has a primary school, but one with just two students. The teachers recently informed the villagers that the school will be closed down due to poor enrolment.RTE betrayedIn 2016-17, as many as 828 government primary and upper primary schools were shut down in Odisha for having less than 10 students each. Its less than a decade since the Indian government displayed some political will to achieve the goal of universal and equitable education by passing the Right to Education Act. But the failure, in practically all the States, of hundreds of government-run neighbourhood schools to even stay open betrays a lack of seriousness in implementing the RTE.In Odisha, the Ranaguda case is hardly the first instance of the State governments inability, and all too often, lack of will, to retain primary students in its neighbourhood schools. In 2014, 195 schools in the State with less than five students were served show-cause notices.In tribal areas like Rayagada and Kandhamal, which also have pockets subject to Maoist influence, the government seems to wilfully favour young children studying in residential schools, cut off from their families. Ostensibly, this is being done to make educational facilities available to those living in remote and conflict-ridden areas. The government even has special programmes to help children who missed out on early education, so that they can be mainstreamed into regular schools. But the fact remains that Ranaguda is 15-20 km away from the district headquarters, and the only reason the children here end up going to residential schools is that the local one doesnt function.This past year, the highest number of free government schools struck off the list, 124, is in the economically backward, though mineral-rich Rayagada district, followed by Kandhamal, which has lost 101 schools.The idea was to merge these erstwhile schools with a primary school located within a kilometres distance or an upper primary school within 3 km. The state would provide transport facilities or an escort if the distance is above the prescribed limit or the terrain difficult. According to Binodini Panda, district project coordinator, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan, another 268 such schools have already been identified for closure in Rayagada, and are awaiting formal approval.Earlier this month, a circular issued by the OPEPA (Odisha Primary Education Programme Authority) to all district project coordinators appeared to provide some relief, as it stated that geographical barriers are valid grounds to consider re-opening schools. But Panda clarifies that so far as re-opening goes, there are no schools under consideration in Rayagada.The Ranaguda villagers, for their part, have appealed to the CRCC (Cluster Resource Centre Coordinator) to reverse the decision. About ten students will be ready to join primary school from the Anganwadi centre next year, they say. But even if the administration agrees, the reason for the low student strength is likely to continue.Gathered together outside one of the pucca houses built under the Indira Awaas Yojana scheme, the parents say that the two teachers hardly ever make the trek here and had last come two days before this reporters visit. Even the Anganwadi worker has been refusing to come here, they say. Complaints to the CRCC have proved futile. In frustration, the residents have been pulling the children out of the village school and sending them away to the nearest hostel schools for adivasi children.The majority of these kids are first generation students. Most of the Kui-speaking women in the village are also non-conversant in Odia, the medium of instruction in the schools. But the will to ensure at least elementary education to their children is high. The basic requirement, which they rightly demand, is the regular presence of teachers.Biju Kolaka is a student of Class 10. He is one of the few older students who continue to live in this village of small farmers, who grow vegetables like tomato, brinjal and chilli. He crosses the river on foot every day to reach school in Jemadeipentho. During the monsoon, when the river swells, it takes Kolaka an hour on bicycle to cross the bridge 10 km away and get to his school. Kolakas elder brother, though, has been sent to study at a residential high school in Rayagada city.The distrust of the education department is palpable. Even though staff strength is low, not in a single government school that we visited were all the appointed teachers present. The teachers in school had their attention divided between students of two or three classes, all sitting together in the same room. Sending students to residential schools is not uncommon here.Increasing cultural alienationThe preference for hostel schools is not from the parents side alone; it is a strategic decision on the part of the State in this fully Scheduled area with a low literacy rate. According to the 2011 Census, the rate of literacy among the Scheduled Tribes (STs) in Odisha was 52.24% against the overall literacy rate of 72.87%.Among the communities living here, dependent mainly on agriculture for their livelihood, the SC & ST Development Department of Odisha states that improving educational facilities through residential institutions has been an identified thrust area.There are different categories of free schools it runs, from high schools to ashram schools for elementary education, sevashrams for primary education, and educational complexes for particularly vulnerable tribal groups. Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya, a central government initiative, focusses on girl students from the SC, ST and OBC groups. Then there are institutions such as the Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences, a private residential school in Bhubaneswar, which claims to provide free education to 27,000 ST children within its 80-acre campus, and has plans to open more such schools in 20 districts of Odisha.Social activists have expressed concerns that this strategy has been increasing a sense of cultural alienation among the students. They are forgetting their family culture and imbibing alien values. A child from a residential school is unable to cope with her village circumstances; he or she looks at it with disdain, has a sense of inferiority, and is always looking for a way out, says Vidhya Das, from the NGO Agragamee that works in 10 districts of Odisha.The current policy is similar to the setting up of residential schools for aboriginal children in Australia and Canada that started in the late 19th century, with assimilation the stated reason. The physical and emotional abuse faced by children removed from their homes, the denial of their cultural heritage and history, their subsequent demands for reparation, as well as the Canadian governments apology for the hardships they faced, are well documented.With the aim of ensuring that tribal children get their education in local schools, Agragamee has provided additional teachers conversant with the Kui language in 18 government primary schools in Rayagada district. They say that this has increased attendance. The education department also runs a similar programme of multilingual education. And yet, the emphasis on residential schools has gained momentum. Anasthesia Kerketa, assistant district education officer, points out that aside from 40 and 100-seat schools, there are now 500-seat ones too.Flourishing private schoolsIn contrast to the government schools in villages, which have been running short of students, many of these residential schools are overcrowded. Gorakhpur High School, an ashram school in Kashipur block of Rayagada, has 1,050 students, of which 220 girls and 473 boys are in residence. The 15 teachers in residence here are well below the mandated student-pupil ratio. We end up admitting so many students due to political pressure, says the headmaster Pitambar Bhoi.Even as the government promotes residential schools, it has been unable to address the main issues that are driving students out of the government schools in their own locality: teacher shortage and teacher motivation.The primary school in Sana Raisingh village in Rayagada block closed a year ago. It used to have a single teacher who would come for just an hour a day, say the villagers. They have already petitioned the collector to reopen the school.When this school closed, the existing students dispersed, some to the closest government school, many to a private school in the neighbourhood. But three physically challenged ST children were left behind. Unable to walk properly, Shadin Menaka, Nimak Raja and Diksha Kolaka dropped out.Opposite the closed school in this 30-household village is a neat row of newly constructed toilets under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan programme. The hamlet includes both Kondh tribals as well as Telugu families belonging to the general category. Some of the latter started sending their children to a private, English-medium convent school in nearby Jimidipeta, which charges annual fees starting from Rs. 3,000. Unlike the nearest government school, the private school sends a vehicle for the children. Theres a bypass road here, with trucks going to Vishakapatnam. So we dont want our children to walk to school. But if the local government school were to reopen, all the students would come back here, says Virata Jagdishwari, who has two daughters studying at the private school.Similar trendsThis is by no means an Odisha story alone. State governments across the country are preparing the ground for the mushrooming of low-cost private schools. According to several media reports, Maharashtra has identified 4,093 schools for closure. Andhra Pradesh, which closed 9,000 schools last year, was one of the first States to experiment with public-private partnership in school education. Rajasthan, which merged as many as 17,000 schools in 2014, will adopt the same policy from the next academic session.Minimum RTE norms are not being achieved in government schools, from maintaining the student-teacher ratio to infrastructure to providing a support system for teachers. With the quality of education dropping, children have been leaving for private schools, says Ambarish Rai, national convenor, RTE Forum.This is clearly the case in the Humma Gram Panchayat area of Odishas Ganjam district, which is also Chief Minister Naveen Patnaiks home turf.In 2013, Ganjam was badly affected by Cyclone Phailin. The cyclone shelters and rehabilitation houses in its rural areas alert one to the fact that this region is prone to natural disasters. The district, which has the highest proportion of SCs living in the state, closed down 70 primary and upper primary schools in 2016-17. District education officer Sanatan Panda says that the migration of skilled workers to Surat and other places has led to the drop in the student enrolment in many blocks. The proliferation of private schools is another reason.In Baunsiapada, a village of Dalit families that make bamboo products, a primary school opened in 2004. The village, situated close to a railway crossing and a busy highway, had to fight hard for it. But the school had a short life. Since 2015, it has been merged with the primary school in Gada Humma. According to the in-charge of the school, Lingaraj Mahankuda, only two of the nine students from Baunsiapada made it to Gada Humma.In 2013, when Mahankuda joined the Gada Humma school, it had 75 students. The number has since shrunk to 42. Educated people who can afford it send their children to private schools, he says. Prafulla Kumar Nayak, who was the president of the school management committee of the now-defunct Baunsiapada school, has enrolled his son at the nearby Sri Sai Saraswati Vidhya Mandir. He considers it a better option for his son.Started only in 2014, this private school presents a stark contrast to the pitiful number of students in the two classrooms at the Gada Humma government school. P. Ravindra Reddy, pradhan acharya of the school, and Suresh Chandra, secretary, put the total number of students at 519, with each paying Rs. 1,200-Rs. 1,800 annually.Run under the aegis of the RSS-backed Bharat Shiksha Vikash Sansthan, the classrooms of this institution turn into hostel rooms at night. Aluminium boxes containing the students belongings are pushed against the walls of the classrooms during the day.The State government has put its hands up, claiming to be overburdened. Of the 11 blocks of Rayagada, only four have block education officers, of whom Kerketa is in charge of two in addition to her duties as assistant director of education. Teachers, too, claim to be overworked.Battle to keep school openMahankuda of the Gada Humma school points out that apart from having to juggle several classes at the same time, they also have to be available for compulsory election duties, do survey work, and supervise mid-day meals and the distribution of iron tablets. Shiksha Sahayaks, or assistant teachers, also mention discriminatory pay scales as a reason for the low motivation level among government teachers.Simanchak Pani, a Shiksha Sahayak at Gabudi primary school in Subalaya panchayat, complains that though he has completed three years at his job, he will be regularised only after another three years. In the meantime, he must make do with Rs. 6,000 per month. How is it possible to remain motivated? he asks.About six months ago, the villagers of Gabudi made a forceful bid to stop the village primary school, which then had seven students, from being closed down. They decided that increasing the student numbers was the only way. Kailash Jena, a farmer, brought his son, Biswajit, back from Saraswati Shishu Mandir, and a few more children living with relatives elsewhere returned to the village. The school now has 11 students, and its future remains precarious unless the numbers increase.Several residents of the village (all of them non-SC/ST) have migrated to work in the Alang shipyards, and to seek employment as skilled workers in the textile and marble industries of Gujarat. As his neighbours laugh, Jena says that family planning has been their downfall so far as school enrolment numbers are concerned. An SC-ST village a kilometre down doesnt have that problem, he jokes, creating traffic jams on their road to school. Clearly, Gabudi village doesnt want its own primary school merged with that one.Minimum RTE norms are not being achieved in government schools, from maintaining the student-teacher ratio to infrastructure to providing a support system for teachers.Ambarish Rai,National convenor, RTE ForumA child from a residential school is unable to cope with their village circumstances, they look at it with disdain, have a sense of inferiority, and are always looking for a way out.Vidhya Das,NGO Agragamee"

A group of die-hard club sandwich lovers was discussing if the dish had disappeared from restaurants. Some even were writing an epitaph to the dish.I dont think the multi-layered sandwich has disappeared, but I do agree that they are not as popular as they used to be. I suppose todays restaurant-goers have a lot else to choose from.But as far as I am concerned, club sandwiches rule. And thats why, when we were sitting out on the terrace of a rooftop restaurant in Kathmandu, with a huge menu placed in front of us, I still opted for a plate of club sandwiches.The restaurant is called Mezze, and it is in a mall on Darbar Marg. It was a pleasantly sunny afternoon when we landed up there. The terrace is picturesque, and you can stand by the railing and see the bustling city. And you can eat your club sandwich as life goes by.The Super-Club Sandwich was rather nice.Perfect stuffingStacks of triangular slices were filled with all the stuff that you need in a sandwich  bacon, chicken, egg, lettuce and tomato. And, of course, you cant have this and not have French fries dipped in ketchup, topped with black pepper.My love affair with club sandwiches began some 40 years ago, when I had my first delicious bite at the Machan, the coffee shop at Taj Mansingh. The coffee shop at the erstwhile Kaniskha Hotel offered good club sandwiches, too.Later, it was my regular fare at Cellars, which became Parlour at some point of time. I have had them at the Calcutta Club in Kolkata, and in sundry little restaurants here and there. When people ask for their chicken stroganoff or roasted lamb in mint sauce or lobster thermidor, I go for the club sandwich. I think what makes it so special is that one bite gives you at once a melange of tastes and flavours  of pork, chicken, egg, veggies, and of course, the nice texture and smack of bread.Mezze offers you a lot more  from pizzas and pasta to pork chops and fried fish. We tried out the fried fish, which was crispy, with a well-browned crumbed shell.Succulent chopsThe pork chops were juicy and nicely fatty, and came with a buttery mound of mashed potatoes. And I could tell by grubby faces of the young pizza lovers that they were happy with their well-topped wedges.A foodie among us asked for the Yaki beef with scallions  which he loved  and someone else had a Panini Caprese  with mozzarella, tomato, basil and capers. And a youngster went back there the next day for some carbonara pasta  with bacon and cheese.We had a very pleasant young man called Bikram serving us  who took all our eccentricities and demands in stride and with a smile. And he told us, rather helpfully, that the restaurant has a branch in New Delhi  the Roadhouse Caf in Greater Kailash.So, I dont think club sandwich lovers need to despair. The dish may not be at the head of the table any more, but it is alive and kicking  and may it continue to do so. And let the tribe of club sandwich lovers increase."

The growth in the industry has started to stagnate since the imposition of the 18% GST and there is urgent need to bring down GST rate to 12%.Biscuits are a common product of consumption from a rickshaw puller to a low-wage labourer in search of hygiene, energy, nutrition at a low cost, B.P.

Over the last few weeks, across India the price of potatoes has fallen sharply after a year of bumper production. With the price of a kilogram of potato dropping as low as under a rupee in certain wholesale markets, many distressed farmers have left their produce to rot on the roads, and in cold storage facilities. Curiously, potato prices were many times higher just months ago amid scarce supply. Last year, the price of other produce like red chilli, tur dal and tomato witnessed a similar trend of steep falls compared to the previous season. The sharp swing in prices has been explained by the Cobweb phenomenon. Farmers tend to increase the production of certain crops in response to their high prices during the previous season, which in turn leads to a supply glut that causes prices to crash. The cycle repeats each passing year, with the lag between price and production causing a huge mismatch between supply and demand. The present fall in potato prices comes against the backdrop of a slowdown in the rural economy. According to advance GDP estimates released by the government last week, farm growth is expected to drop from 4.9% in 2016-17 to 2.1% in 2017-18.Given the humanitarian and political costs of agricultural distress, particularly in a year when many big States go to the polls, local governments could turn towards populism to satisfy their rural voter base. This could come in the form of fiscal measures such as farm loan waivers, a higher minimum support price for farm produce, or some combination of the two. The next Union budget may well be focussed on the rural economy through fiscal measures. Such relief measures that temporarily ease the pain on farmers, however, will fail to make a significant difference to their lives in the long run. Any permanent solution to the problem of agricultural distress will have to deal with the challenge of price fluctuations. The boom-and-bust cycle is the result of a broken supply chain that is over-regulated. In the absence of a robust market for buying and selling forward-looking contracts, farmers are left to fend for themselves against severe fluctuations. In addition, the domination of the wholesale market by cartels prevents farmers from receiving a fair price even when their produce is sold at much higher rates to consumers. The government must resolve to address these structural issues, and not limit itself to ad hoc policy measures in firefighting mode. There is a need to give farmers not just a better, but also more stable, return on their crops."

Some traders, who could not clear the arrivals, preferred to dump them as waste, which eventually was transported to Ariyamangalam dump yard on Wednesday.Traders attribute the slump in prices to heavy arrival of vegetables than the actual demand over the past few weeks. Besides the arrivals from Dindigul, Theni, Pollachi, Oddanchathiram, Kallupatty and Vaiyampatty, the market in Tiruchi continues to get excess loads of tomato from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh apparently due to heavy productivity.The prices of vegetables always rule low during winter season as it is conducive for vegetable cultivation.

Simple and reliant on local ingredients, the dish is a burst of flavours. The shrimp polenta comes on a bed of cornmeal, and gives us a taste of Italian seafood.Our main course is the risotto we cooked, while we find it a tad bit bland, a generous sprinkle of parmesan shavings does the trick. Our dessert, spumone alla grappa with bitter chocolate ice cream and raspberry sorbet is a let-down as it comes without any spumoni or three-layered gelato. The raspberry sorbet has been replaced by orange marmalade, which adds a tang to the bitter chocolate ice cream.In a conversation after the meal, Gattoo, who arrived in the city a day before our meal, says hes excited to visit the local markets. It is very important to cook with ingredients available locally. No point cooking with things got from all over the world, he tells us, explaining that the menu has been made with vegetarian dishes in mind. The beans here are excellent for pasta e fagioli soup and even the edible flowers are great.Breaking some myths, Gattoo laughs, There is no such thing as pink sauce. We have the mama rosa, but even that is not an authentic Italian dish. After the Second World War, Italy was a poor nation, and many chefs moved out for work. That is when the fusion started. Think pizza with pineapple! Today, you can put anything on a pizza. But food to me is nostalgia, the power of memory, he signs off, recommending his special dish of padava chicken from his hometown.

Kote and surrounding places, said Ramesh, a wholesale dealer. But with excess cultivation this year, the price of the crop has remained low for over a month, he added.For farmers, the cost of cultivating tomato on an acre of land is reckoned to be around Rs. 1 lakh, which includes daily wages of nearly Rs. 400 per head. Cultivators can hope to reap a net profit only if the market price is fixed at around Rs. 10 a kg. Otherwise, it will be a loss, said Mr. Ramesh, who however said that the situation was unlikely to improve for at least another month.The APMC yard in Mysuru receives 20-30 tonnes of tomatoes, the bulk of which is transported to Kerala. The hybrid variety of the produce comes from Hassan and Mandya while the demand from the local market is met with what is cultivated around the region.While seasonal variation in production and price fluctuation is the norm when it comes to agricultural produce, tomato farmers tend to be the worst affected as prices remain low for long as supply mostly outstrips the demand, according to wholesaler dealers at the APMC yard. This only benefits procurement agents and dealers.A few local farmers like Atiahalli Devaraja pointed out that prices pick up when the demand for tomatoes is fuelled by food-processing units involved in the manufacture of jams, pickles and the like. But in case there is a lull in demand or the units outsource the crop for a better rate from other places, then the local farmers are affected, and more so in the absence of refrigeration and storage facilities, he said."

A recent survey conducted by mobile health and fitness platform, HealthifyMe, confirmed as much, with the average consumption of fruit and vegetables decidedly less than the recommended five. Patna at 1.63 servings ate the most fruit, while Nagpur at 1.2 servings ate the least. Keralas reputation as a meat-centred population may not be unfounded, with both Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi eating only 1.45 servings and 1.57 servings of vegetables a day. The most recent National Family Health Survey, released by the Ministry of Health in 2016, confirms as much, with less than half (47%) of Indian women, consuming green, leafy vegetables on a regular basis.Your body needs both macronutrients and micronutrients to function effectively, says Bengaluru-based clinical nutritionist, Dr Anju Sood. Macronutrients, which, as the name suggests, are substances needed in large quantities, give your body energy to perform its essential functions and help the body grow and repair itself. Fats, carbohydrates and protein fall under this category. Then you have the micronutrients, substances that are important, but are needed in far less amounts. But they are needed for overall wellness, as they aid in metabolism regulation, enzyme and hormone production, enhance bone density and perform a whole lot of other tasks. These include your vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals. Eating plenty of fibre-rich fruits and vegetables is a great way to get in your micros, agrees Dr Sood. And, lets be honest, they do look pretty on your plate too. So, eat the rainbow, as they say. And heres how (and why) you do it.Red loveRed fruits and vegetables like watermelon and tomatoes are very rich in lycopene, a very powerful antioxidant, says Dr Sood. Since antioxidants help combat the effect of free radicals that cause cellular damage, they are believed to help prevent heart disease, ageing, and cancer. Also, many red foods contain beta-carotene, the precursor to Vitamin A, a very important fat-soluble vitamin that our body needs, adds Bengaluru-based nutritionist, Shalini Manglani Alwani. Vitamin A supports growth, vision and protects you from diseases, she says.Sunny goodnessThe subtle sweetness of pumpkin, the tang of citrus fruits like oranges, lemons and tangerines, the tropical goodness of jackfruit, papaya, mango or pineapple these dont just taste delicious, but they are extremely good for you. Yellow and orange fruits are again very rich in beta-carotene, says Dr Sood. That is why we tell children to eat a lot of carrots, she says. Citrus fruits, additionally, are powerhouses of vitamin C, which helps in collagen formation and aids natural healing, says Alwani. Gorgeous skin anyone? Eat lots of yellow.Supergreens are hereWonder why green juices and smoothies have been doing the rounds? We really dont get enough of them though. We should, says Alwani. It is rich in a variety of mircros, including, Vitamin A, beta-carotene, vitamin K and E, folic acid, vitamin C, calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and iron, she says.From bone and teeth health to aiding brain function, oxygen transportation and enzyme catalysis, greens are great for you. The green colour comes in because of chlorophyll, which has a strong antioxidant and anticancer effect, adds Dr Sood. So yes, your grandmother was right about the keerai.Purple powerBlueberries, eggplant, purple raisins and grapes, onions, beetroot and plums get their colour from a blue pigment called anthocyanin, says Dr Sood. Anthocyanin, a powerful antioxidant, has been linked to increased longevity, better brain health and reduces liver damage, among other things. They also contain resveratrol, a flavonoid antioxidant that protects the inner linings of your arteries.Eating plenty of fibre-rich fruits and vegetables is a great way to get in your micros"

But the sale has not picked up, say traders.Lack of cold storage facilities has worsened the issue of price fluctuations, and traders urged the government to set up such facilities in the market.Many vegetables cost around Rs. 10 a kg in the wholesale market as it receives nearly truckloads of produce daily. Tomatoes are priced at a minimum of Rs. 6 per kg. Broad beans was priced the lowest of Rs. 3 per kg in the market until a couple of weeks ago and the cost has climbed to Rs. 10 a kg now. This was the lowest price in the past three to five years, traders said. While cabbages are priced at Rs. 4 per kg, beans and capsicum too cost around Rs. 12.P. Sukumar, treasurer, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants Association, said as prices have fallen small farmers may stop cultivation, and this would lead to price fluctuation in the coming months. Moreover, cost of vegetables usually begin to escalate around summer.We may be able to supply vegetable at a stable price if there are cold storage facilities. Surplus produce could also be exported to other countries, he said. The association has also represented to the Chief Minister about establishing cold storage facilities."

In fact, some of my best friends are accountants. But all things considered, youll agree when I say that the world would be a much improved place without accountants.Anthropologists and evolutionary psychologists tell us that the human brain has not evolved to live in a society that includes Form 16. Just imagine if all the worlds accountants were to disappear through a wormhole into a parallel universe from where its impossible to come back. The immediate benefit would be no more income tax, which means no more running around to make last-minute tax-saving investments.Yes, I am aware its that time of the year when many of you, especially the salaried class, are racing to meet the deadline for submitting investment proofs to Accounts. Now that the good times are finally here and youre making tonnes of money, I know you are seeking the best avenues for converting your rapidly growing savings into insanely profitable investments.I am also aware that in the investment declaration form that you submitted last year, you had declared investments of Rs. 30 lakh from your Rs. 10 lakh salary so that they didnt accidentally deduct Rs. 40 lakh as income tax.But relax. Many years ago, I used to work at a personal finance suicide helpline for people who had lost all their savings to bad investments. So I do possess some expertise in money matters. This is an important life skill these days because even though things are going well  the GDP is booming, onions are affordable, and jobs are plentiful so long as youre not snobbish about selling pakodas  a handful of anti-nationals have made it almost impossible to find a safe investment.Real estate is out, unless you want to help debt-stricken developers offload their unsold inventory. Fixed deposits are also out, unless you want to help NPA-afflicted banks with cheap funds. And Im betting you already own half-a-dozen insurance policies whose premiums are killing you softly.So that leaves equities as the only option.

5b1423e49855b7624637d5b8,It’s time to reimagine South Asia,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/its-time-to-reimagine-south-asia/article22938048.ece,2018-03-06,,The Hindu,"A few months ago, Anjum Altaf, former dean of the prestigious Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), wrote an article in the Dawn newspaper, making a strong case for mutually beneficial economic cooperation between Pakistan and India. He also gave a revealing example of how this has become impossible because of blind nationalism in Pakistan.At the time, he wrote, when tomatoes were selling for Rs300 a kilo in Lahore, they were available at Indian Rs40 a kilo in Amritsar a mere 30 miles away. But a visceral Indo-phobia, shared by many of our influentials, stood in the way of consumers benefiting from the lower priced supply. Many Pakistani politicians want nothing to be imported from India, the enemy nation.This kind of blind nationalism is by no means Pakistans monopoly. Those who watch Indian TV channels debating India-Pakistan relations routinely hear similar Pak-phobia. Result: despite being neighbours, India and Pakistan are among the least integrated nations in the world. Because of their unending mutual hostility, South Asia too has become the least integrated region in the world. The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is in a coma. Sadly, the most populous region in the world has also remained home to the largest number of poor people in the world.So near, so farA few striking examples will show how our two countries, which were part of a single seamless socio-economic and cultural entity before 1947, have now completely drifted apart. There are no direct flights between their capitals  New Delhi and Islamabad. The frequency of Delhi-Lahore and Mumbai-Karachi flights have become minimal. The Mumbai-Karachi ferry service (the two port cities, once part of a single province, are closer to each other than either Mumbai and Delhi or Karachi and Islamabad) was stopped after the 1965 war.In this age of information revolution, the number of phone calls between Indian and Pakistani citizens (including calls between close relatives of divided families) is negligible, mostly out of fear of being questioned by their respective security agencies. At less than $3 billion annually, trade with Pakistan accounts for a meagre 0.4% of Indias growing global commerce.Those who are happy with this status quo have set responses. On the Indian side, it will be said that terror and trade cannot go together. The Narendra Modi government has raised the bar higher  terror and talks cannot go together. On the Pakistani side, resolution of the Kashmir issue has become a precondition for any substantial bilateral cooperation.But is the status quo benefiting either country? The answer is obvious, except to those arrogant ultra-nationalists who think India now has a seat on the global high table and hence need not care for Pakistan, and to those narrow-minded Pakistani patriots who think they need not care for India since they now have two protectors  China and the Muslim Ummah.China, of course, has become a new factor influencing Indias negative attitude towards Pakistan, both among policy-makers and the common people. Our Army chief, General Bipin Rawats egregious remark last year about India being ready for a simultaneous two-and-a-half front war with Pakistan and China (the half front being our own alienated people in Kashmir) has helped solidify an impression that our two large neighbours can never be friendly towards India. If Indias foreign and defence policies proceed on this belief, South Asia is surely heading towards a future of intensified hostilities and conflicts. Arms manufacturers and distant destabilisers will profit by this at the cost of common Indians and Pakistanis, who need employment, education, health care and food-and-environmental security. These needs can be met only through regional cooperation, not regional rivalry.China, part of the solutionIn other words, can China become a part of the solution, rather than being perceived as a part of the India-Pakistan problem? A three-way India-China-Pakistan cooperation is not only necessary but indeed possible, and Chinese President Xi Jinpings Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) provides a practical framework for such partnership. Unfortunately, Mr. Modi has allowed himself to be misled by his advisers on the BRI. The governments opposition to the BRI is based, among other things, on the myopic argument that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a flagship project under the BRI, violates Indias sovereignty since it passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).Not only does this argument hold no water but it also undermines Indias long-term development and security interests. First, CPEC does not recognise PoK to be Pakistans sovereign territory. Article VI in the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement clearly states in that after the settlement of the Kashmir dispute between Pakistan and India, the sovereign authority concerned will reopen negotiations with the Government of the Peoples Republic of China.... Second, there is little possibility of India ever getting PoK, or Pakistan ever getting the Indian side of Kashmir, through war or by any other means. Therefore, connectivity, cooperation and economic integration are the only realistic bases for any future India-Pakistan settlement of the Kashmir dispute.Third, and most important, both China and Pakistan have stated that they are open to India joining CPEC. China has also expressed its readiness to rename CPEC suitably to both address Indias concerns and to reflect the projects expanded regional scope. Already, Iran, Afghanistan and several Central Asian republics have agreed to join this ambitious regional connectivity project. Will it help or hurt India if it joins this renamed initiative as an equal partner? Will it not connect Lahore and Amritsar (also Delhi and the rest of India), the two sides of Kashmir (which all Kashmir-based political parties want), Sindh and southern Punjab with Gujarat and Rajasthan, and Karachi with Mumbai?Interdependence vitalA no less seminal benefit for India is that by joining the renamed CPEC, it would gain land access, through Pakistan, to Afghanistan, Iran, Central Asia and western China. And if our leaders show vision, ambition and resolve, the CPEC-plus-India can be linked to the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Corridor, thus creating a grand garland of connectivity and integration for the whole of South Asia. If 1947 divided our subcontinent, here is an opportunity for India, Pakistan and all other countries in the region to come together and rise in shared progress and prosperity.Regrettably, the same short-sighted advisers who have misled Mr. Modi on the BRI and CPEC are selling India the pipe dream of an alternative connectivity project by the Quadrilateral of the U.S., Japan, Australia and India. This is unlikely to take off. Even if it does, its developmental benefits to India will be limited since it will seek to keep China and Pakistan out. We are also told that India does not need the CPEC since it has already partnered with Iran in building the Chabahar port. Indias gains due to Chabahar are modest, and nowhere comparable to those that would accrue by India having a direct land access to Afghanistan through Pakistan, courtesy a renamed CPEC. The latter is also indispensable for the success of two other mega projects that are critical for Indias energy security and accelerated economic growth  the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) and Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipelines.Here is another huge potential gain for South Asia. The proposed connectivity initiative, which would create strong new bonds of regional cooperation and interdependence, could also help resolve three long-standing geopolitical problems in the region, in which countless people have been killed  terrorism, Kashmir and Afghanistan.To realise this vision of a resurgent South Asia, two obstacles will have to be removed blind nationalism and the unfriendly designs of extra-regional powers. As Karl Marx would have said: peoples of South Asia and China, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains; you have a bright new future to win.Sudheendra Kulkarni served in the Prime Ministers Office during Atal Bihari Vajpayees tenure"

Kavita Shah is one of the few faces at the top of the hierarchy at BHU. She is currently the only woman director at the university. She leads the Institute of Environmental and Sustainable Development.EducationKavita started off as a chemistry student at womens college at BHU named Mahila Mahavidyalaya (MMV). Years later, she would set up the first CIL  Central Instrumentation Laboratory here  a deck of necessary scientific instruments. But before she could do this, Kavita had to gather her scientific mettle. She did a Ph.D, also at BHU. Her research question involved a range of biochemical experiments. Following this were post doc stints in Japan and Switzerland. When she returned to India she took up lectureship in NEHU (North East Hill University) in Shillong. As an opportunity propped up, Kavita returned to Varanasi to teach at BHU. She brought her first PhD student with her from Shillong.ResearchKavitas scientific life now spans 24 years. After setting up the CIL in the womens college that is still in use, Kavita moved to the science faculty and then the IESD, of which she is now director. Kavitas scientific focus is on enzymes and how to make use of them. She won the Women Scientist Award 2011 from The Biotech Research Society for developing an enzyme-based sensor of the neurotransmitter dopamine. This sensor can monitor levels of dopamine in neurological patients to help administer proper dose of the drug to patients with Alzheimers/Parkinsons diseases. Kavita had found another novel application of this enzyme. Using nanotechnology, she has created a pollutant biosensor from this enzyme.Dye houses that exist in thousands in the saree-producing Varanasi area are small units using chemicals affluents. They discard the waste water directly in the soil after dying, but this water ultimately comes to their own tap water and drinking water or their agricultural land. It gets accumulated in the water table and then there is no way to remove it. To avoid such contamination we are preparing to give dyers the small instruments (bioreactors) at a very low cost so that the contaminated waste water can be treated. We have a prototype for testing it, she said.Additionally, with her students she is involved in mapping polluting sources of the Ganga including sewage and prolonged use as funeral sites that has led to silting. She also has methods to make transgenic tomatoes, genetic sequences of common root rot and protein models of enzymes that come from rice.The author is a science writer and part of The Life of Science project.

Parthasarathi told The Hindu that the crop colonies concept was being implemented on a pilot basis in Ibrahimpatnam-Manchal-Yacharam cluster in Rangareddy district this agriculture year (2017-18) on 5,000 acres with 2,000 farmers. They were supplied high-quality seedlings of tomato, brinjal and chilli raised in the Centre of Excellence at Jeedimetla here.Besides, the farmers were provided micro irrigation, subsidised seedlings, poly houses, pandals with an expenditure of Rs. 5 crore.Mr. Parthasarathi explained that the concept of crop colonies was basically aimed at ensuring self-sufficiency in agricultural produce, preventing market glut due to excess production of any crop and to make agriculture a remunerative activity based on the soil varieties, existing cropping patterns, consumption and production and providing marketing facility.As part of encouraging crop colonies around Hyderabad, it is also being planned to establish eight new markets along the Outer Ring Road and the Collectors of Rangareddy and Medchal have been requested to allot sites for the purpose so that godowns, including cold storages, could be constructed there.However, the issue of ensuring remunerative or at least support price to the produce in such crop colonies is still expected to be a major challenge to make the concept successful."

While the disease could be controlled with medication, many a time, there was little compliance of the regimen by patients.Over the past decade, the World Glaucoma Association has been conducting a worldwide drive to increase awareness about glaucoma.

Jagan Mohan Reddy on Wednesday lambasted Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, saying that he had hoodwinked all sections of people with false promises during the 2014 elections.He said people were waiting for an opportunity to teach Mr. Naidu a fitting lesson in the next elections.I would bring back Rajanna Rajyam if the YSRCP is voted to power in the 2019 elections with the blessings of people, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy asserted.Addressing a public meeting at the Kalikiri crossroads in Piler Assembly constituency, the native of former Chief Minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy, the Opposition leader said it was ridiculous on the part of Mr. Naidu to claim credit for the irrigation and drinking water projects in the State.Many water projects and schemes had, in fact, been initiated by Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy. Most of them were on the verge of completion with over 80% work done. The TDP government has not been able to complete the remaining work because of corruption, he charged.Referring to the TDPs poll promise of providing jobs for youth, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said that Mr. Naidu had disappointed the youth.He also termed the public distribution system an utter failure, as, except rice, all other items had been withdrawn, leaving the poor and the downtrodden families in the lurch.Referring to the plight of the farmers, Mr. Jagan said he would ensure security for the growers of tomato, cotton, and other commercial crops by creating a corpus fund of Rs. 2,000 crore. He spoke extensively on the partys Navaratnalu promises.Mr. Jagan, during his address, did not refer to the Nallari family as was widely expected.Earlier, Mr. Jagan commenced his padayatra from the Madanapalle constituency limits and entered Chintaparthi, the native of Nagari MLA R.K.

The outgo on MSP and MIS was far higher than the previous governments Rs. 358 crore for 10 years, said Agriculture Minister Somireddi Chandramohan Reddy.The Minister was replying to an issue  MSP and market intervention scheme  raised by MLAs Y.Sambasiva Rao, D. Bala Veeranjaneya Swamy and Arimilli Radhakrishna under rule 344 in Assembly on Friday.The Minister said that the government procured maize, jowar, millets, black gram, green gram, red gram, bengal gram, black jaggery and turmeric under the MSP/MIS. The Central government would not declare the MSP for certain cash crops like turmeric, chillies and also products like black jaggery. On case to case basis, sometimes the Central government would sanction MIS but for fixed quantity. It created a lot of unrest among the farming community and avoidable negative publicity to the government. So, the government introduced price support scheme for red chillies and market intervention activity was taken up for onions and tomatoes to help the farmers, he said.The government had procured 5.44 lakh MT of agricultural commodities like maize, jowar and pulses. In addition, 55.57 lakh MT of paddy was procured from 2012-13 to 2016-17. The total paddy purchased under MSP was 39.54 lakh metric tonnes (LMTs). The paddy shifted for custom milling was 39.42 LMT, he said.Centres clarificationUnion Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, in the Budget 2018-19, stated that all notified crops under Kharif marketing season 2018-19 would be fixed at a minimum of 50% above cost of cultivation. It was later clarified that the cost to be considered for this calculation would be actual paid out cost plus value of family labour. So, the potential rise in MSP for paddy (common) would be 8% while it would be 5% for Grade A. The MSP for paddy had increased by 55% at Rs. 1,550 per quintal in 2017-18, he said.The Central government was fixing a lesser MSP than that suggested by the State government. For the year 2017-18, the State government suggested an MSP of Rs. 2,799 per quintal for paddy. The Centre, however, fixed Rs. 1550 for common variety. While Rs. 3,437 MSP was suggested for Grade A variety, the Centre pegged it at Rs. 1,590. The same was the case with other commodities like jowar, bajra, maize, ragi, and pulses, he added."

And now agricultural scientists have cautioned that these essential ingredients of salad are laced with harmful pesticide residues, which are radioactive in nature. The next time you order salad at a restaurant, make sure that the vegetables are thoroughly washed before they are sliced and served.Some of the kheera samples analysed as part of the all-India network project on pesticide residues by scientists from the city-based Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University contained high dose of dangerous chemical substances. Similar studies conducted earlier in Telangana revealed radioactive pesticide residues on tomato, chilli and cabbage too. Researchers blame indiscriminate use of chemical pesticides and fertilisers for the contamination.Two harmful radioactive substances, flubendiamide and deltamethrin, are present in several vegetable samples including kheera (cucumber), tomato, green chilli and cabbage. These substances are known to cause skin ailments, vomiting, diarrhoea, tremors, irrigation, low blood pressure and shock in case of severe exposure.They are known to create problems in pregnant women.According to experts, certain chemical pesticides and fertilisers contain radioactive substances that continue to stay on vegetables and fruits even after the harvest. The city agricultural scientists found the presence of flubendiamide and deltamethrin, which are radioactive in nature, on kheera. These harmful chemicals enter humans and animals when vegetables or fruits laced with them are consumed.A portion of these chemicals stay in the body and when the quantity reaches a certain level, they begin to show harmful effects, warn experts. Incidentally, flubendiamide and deltamethrin are prohibited in several countries while they are indiscriminately used in agricultural and horticultural fields in Telangana and other parts of the country.The results of the study were published in the latest issue of the scientific journal, Food Additives and Contaminants. The samples of kheera (cucumis sativus) were collected from Telangana and other states. They were analysed for persistence, dissipation and risk assessment of flubendiamide and deltamethrin. These chemicals are sprayed to control insects. Ironically, the chemicals act on the nervous system of insects. They are detrimental to humans too.The team noticed residues of flubendiamide and deltamethrin on kheera (cucumber) resulting from applications of a combination formulation (flubendiamide 90% and deltamethrin 60%). It also studied how long the residue would last on the vegetables when farmers use recommended dose and extra dose of pesticides.Based on the research study, the city farm scientists suggested a maximum residue level of 3 mg per kg of vegetable in case of flubendiamide and 1.5 mg per kg for deltamethrin.However, when compared with the maximum residue level allowed for these substances in developed countries, including European Union (0.2 mg per kg), the recommended dose for vegetables in Telangana is several times higher."

Krishnapriya, who grew up in Veda Nilayam in Poes Garden and lived there until her marriage in 2000.Sources privy to Ms. Krishnapriyas deposition made on January 2 before the Justice Arumughaswamy Commission of Inquiry, where she was summoned, said she claimed that Sasikala had thought of taking Jayalalithaa abroad for better treatment sometime in October 2016 when she was in Apollo Hospitals. But the proposal was turned down by Jayalalithaa.On September 23, 2016, at the hospital, her mother Ilavarasi reportedly told her that Jayalalithaa had gained consciousness in the morning and wanted to know where she was.On being told that she was in a hospital, the then Chief Minister smiled and remarked to a doctor that they would not have been able to bring her to the hospital had she been conscious at the time of shifting.Visitor to ICUStating that no one, except Sasikala, was allowed to meet Jayalalithaa when she was in the Intensive Care Unit, Ms. Krishnapriya said she, her mother and her aunt stayed together on the third floor of the hospital and Sasikala alone used to go to the ICU whenever she was called for.While in hospital, Jayalalithaa ate idlis, pongal and tomato rice in small quantities and even had ice cream.She likes fruits Once she ate grapes and began coughing, Ms. Krishnapriya had told the Commission. [Forest Minister Dindigul C. Sreenivasan had last year apologised publicly claiming he and others had lied that Jayalalithaa ate idli in hospital.]According to her, on December 4, 2016, a day before she died, doctors said that Jayalalithaas brain was functional but the heart could not be resuscitated despite putting her on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). When I reached the hospital, a surgery was underway by cutting open her chest right in the ward. Thereafter, the procedure was continued after shifting her to an operation theatre, she added.Medical miracleShe claimed that her aunt Sasikala expected a medical miracle to happen anytime. Therefore, she asked the doctors to continue to keep Jayalalithaa on life support and provide treatment as usual.The deponent had told the Commission that she was not aware whether Jayalalithaas brain was functional when the life support was withdrawn on December 5, 2016.ECMO was discontinued beyond the evening hours of December 5, 2016. One of her saris was brought from home and it was draped around the body before we took it home. The body was then laid in the drawing room of the house and rituals were performed with the assistance of a priest Around seven women assisted in the process, her statement read.No one except Sasikala was allowed to meet Jayalalithaa when she was in the Intensive Care Unit"

Field workers of DHAN had been encouraging low-income households to raise gardens of their own so that they could prepare nutritious food. Many are under the assumption that gardening is a pastime of the elite. Even those who are interested in raising a terrace garden are apprehensive of the initial investment and poor yield. We ask such people to raise spinach. They germinate quickly and help in controlling anaemia, a major problem for adolescent girls in Madurai. The encouraging results keep them going, said Lokesh Sinram, Environment Engineer at DHAN Foundation.One can use goat and cow manure, procure good quality soil instead of using hybrid seeds and urea. The substitutes work effectively and provide healthier vegetables, he said.Presently 115 families are involved in rooftop gardening. The effort has seen several enthusiastic women and children investing time and effort into raising the plants. The fear of nutrient-deficient food is urging people to go the organic way and plant a variety of seeds with enough yield for a nuclear family.K. Tamilarasi and her family started their rooftop garden last year. They have raised a variety of plants, including chilli, cabbage, spinach, radish and tomato, and have seen a good yield. We use our own vegetables in our kitchen. Children do not waste food because they understand the effort that goes into producing it, said K. Karthikeyan, her son.As summer looms ahead, the coir bags help retain moisture and provide a cooling effect during daytime. Gardening even brings peace of mind after a stressful day. It also provides additional income for homemakers, thus providing sustainable growth solutions, Mr. Lokesh said.For more information regarding rooftop gardens, contact the Horticulture Department at 96266 04488 or DHAN Foundation at 90924 04647."
5b147c029855b72e9ad63f1d,Learning from the ‘long march’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/learning-from-the-long-march/article23345442.ece,2018-03-25,,The Hindu,"Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis did the right thing when an army of 40,000 barefoot, largely Adivasi farmers descended on Mumbai earlier this month. The right thing, that is, if the objective was to as quickly as possible remove this disturbing reminder of farm distress from the glare of the media  and future, non-farmer voters. He caved in, extended his previous loan waiver scheme to yet more farmers for an even longer period, and also promised to transfer land to Adivasi farmers as guaranteed by the Forest Rights Act of 2006.Convenient movesIt was, however, exactly the wrong thing to do if the objective was to address the root causes of the farmers problems and prevent such acute distress from building up again. But a loan waiver is easier to promise, and does not upset any of the existing political apple carts. And it is easily marketable as a farmer-friendly gesture by a magnanimous government.Except that it isnt. If anybody knows the issues Indian farmers grapple with, its the father of Indias Green Revolution, M.S. Swaminathan. And he said that loan waivers provide at best temporary relief but actually work against the creation of a reliable farm credit system in the long run. Worse, because of the large sums of money involved in such gestures, money that is required for things farmers actually need and will benefit from, like crop and seed research, soil improvement or pest protection, is eaten up by such futile gestures.In the Union Budget for 2018-19, only 12% of the spend is for investments  the rest was eaten up by subsidies, crop insurance schemes and the like. Worse, most of the direct beneficiaries of farm subsidies are in the organised sector  fertiliser companies, tractor manufacturers and so on. The actual farmer gets to see little of the money.But loan waivers are politically sexy, so every State is trying to outdo the other in such competitive populism, particularly as the general elections draw near. While the fiscal position takes a hit because of such write-offs, most of the money, due to corruption and inefficiencies, does not reach the intended beneficiaries. In Maharashtra, of the Rs. 34,000 crore loan waiver announced in 2017 (prior to the latest announcement), only Rs. 13,580 crore was actually disbursed, according to data given to Maharashtra legislators by the State government,Firstpostreported. And even here, it is anybodys guess as to who actually got the money. A Shiv Sena MLA created a furore in the Maharashtra Assembly by pointing out that he had received Rs. 25,000 from the government under the scheme even though he had neither applied for relief, nor, being a legislator, was actually eligible. To be fair, such mix-ups are not the preserve of any one State. More recently in Tamil Nadu, farmers in Dindigul were up in arms after getting compensation cheques for Rs. 5 and Rs. 10, when the government had promised up to Rs. 26,000 per acre for yield loss in paddy!The same old problems recur with depressing regularity. The Odisha Assembly was disrupted last Friday after Opposition MLAs protested the alleged distress sale of tomatoes in the State. Meanwhile in Karnataka, there is acute distress among both toor dal growers and dal millers. The growers, responding to last years surge in retail dal prices, and the governments response of steeply hiking the minimum support price, had produced a bumper crop. Now, they want the government to buy at the promised price, while refusing to sell to millers at the prevailing market price, which is nearly 50% lower.The government says it is seized of the matter and is working on solutions. At a talkfest in the capital last week, Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog, said, It is finally time we must focus only and only on farmers and farmers distress.Thats all very well, but it is not as if the solutions are not known. What farmers actually need is a robust and reliable credit infrastructure which allows them to access credit when they require it, better infrastructure to prevent yield loss (Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself said in a speech last year that agri products worth Rs. 1 lakh crore are ruined annually due to insufficient infrastructure in the agricultural sector), better market access for their output, access to better information on crop prices and, of course, reliable weather-proofing and yield loss insurance.Political turfBut that will mean upsetting many cosy political fiefdoms. Political parties across the spectrum have prevented the flawed agricultural market yard system from being revamped, because it is the basis for exercising political power and influence in rural areas. MSPs remain on paper, arbitrary and irrational price and import/export curbs in the name of the consumer actually end up hurting both consumers and producers one could go on.Perhaps the real lesson to be learnt from farmers protests like the long march is that pushed long enough and hard enough by the current system, the India farmer will eventually rise up and try to change it  with or without your consent."

The wholesale rate of tomato is around Rs 10/kg and its available at Rs 15-20 in retail market, Choithram Sabjimandi Kalyan Sangh secretary Nikhil Hardiya told TOI.He said that as crops supply is expected to reduce, tomatos rate is likely to go up in next month. Wholesale rate of potato is still below Rs 10/kg as good production of the crop and farmers disinterest to keep it in the cold-storage for longtime are stated to be the reasons behind the low-price.Potato is being sold at Rs 7-8 in Choithram wholesale vegetable market while the retail price hovers around Rs 15/kg, Aaloo Pyaaj Vyapari Sangh, Indore vice-president Vijay Garg told TOI.He said that a few weeks ago, potatos wholesale price had hit a new low of the season as the rate had gone down to Rs 1/kg.Quality of the crop, which was sold around Rs 1/kg, was however not as good as what is available in the market. Most of the potato crop, sold earlier, was deteriorating in the cold-storage and to avoid further loss, the farmers sold it at the minimum rate, Garg said.Wholesale rate of garlic has also witnessed a downtrend in recent past.Excess production of the crop is the main reason behind the reduced rate Garg said. Unlike these crops, the rate of another vital commodity i.e. onion has however witnessed a rise.Few weeks ago, the wholesale rate of onion was around Rs 25/kg while the retail price was between Rs 40-45. The crop is now being sold at Rs 30-35/kg in wholesale market while the retail rate is around Rs 50-60/kg Garg said."

This crisis has raised troubling questions about the harvesting of the personal data of millions, and their use in influencing those two defining political events of 2016.A recent article inScienceanalyses the prevalence of false news and delves into the reasons for its proliferation. The results of the research, which studied 126,000 stories tweeted by approximately three million people more than 4.5 million times between 2006 and 2017, might leave cynics unsurprised: The MIT researchers found that false news spreads farther, faster, deeper, and more widely than true news. Yet what might surprise even cynics is that this difference was not due to bots and automatons, but to the efforts of human tweeters. The persons tweeting false stories typically have fewer followers, follow fewer people, and have been on Twitter for a relatively short time. The study also found that false news diffused to between 100 and 100,000 people routinely, whereas truth only reached up to 1,000 people. Many more people retweeted false news than truth. True news took six times as long as falsehood to reach just 1,500 people. They also found that falsehood was 70% more likely to be retweeted. The key reasons behind this, according to the authors, are the emotions inspired by the two types of news. While they found that false news inspired surprise and disgust, truth caused sadness, anticipation, joy and trust. Evidently, the former set is more powerful. Perhaps not coincidentally, psychological analysis was extensively employed by Cambridge Analytica, the data company that exploited the personal data of social media users to target certain demographics with political messaging designed to influence their voting behaviour.In the same issue,Sciencepublished another study which discusses the role of bots and deliberate amplification of fake news. In an email toThe Hindu, author Fillipo Menczer of Indiana University, clarified, The MIT study focusses on one of these factors, namely the novelty of false news. Other factors include cognitive, social, and algorithmic biases that make people vulnerable to manipulation  engagement-based ranking, limited attention, selective exposure, confirmation bias, echo chambers Mr. Menczer highlighted the supplementary materials section of the MIT work which shows that when the contribution of bots is factored out, the spread of false news is suppressed more than that of true news. Therefore, while humans do have an active role in spreading false news, the role of bots as an amplifying factor cannot be discounted.What these studies suggest is that understanding how and why false news spreads, establishing fact-checking sites and spreading awareness among people not to get taken in by novelty value when retweeting or spreading stories could be the key to reducing the spread of false news."

Agraharam areas. Last year, the local yield was exhausted by this time. This year, we have sufficient crop which will last till April. Once the local supply starts dipping, tomatoes will be sourced from Madanapalle, Kurnool and Bengaluru, says D. Raju, EO of Peda Waltair Rythu Bazaar.Cold storage facilityAlthough consumers are buying large quantities of tomatoes at present, department officials stress on the effective utilisation of cold storage facility to address wastage problem.Though we have two cold storage facilities in Gopalapatnam and MVP Colony Rythu Bazaars with a capacity of five metric tonnes each, most farmers prefer to sell the tomatoes at a nominal cost before they sign off for the day. If they utilise the facility available, it will help them fetch good price for tomotoes, observes T. Linga Murthy, EO of MVP Rythu Bazaar.According to Assistant Director of Horticulture Department K. Sailaja, tomato was grown in 1,085 hectares of area this year against 920 hectares last year. With one-third of farmers using organic farming methods, the tomato yield has gone up considerably, she says. For entrepreneurs who want to invest in the processing units to convert tomatoes into value-added products like jelly, puree, pickles and sauce, the Department of Horticulture is providing 35% credit linked back-ended subsidy which further enables optimum utilisation of the local crop."

5b149ad79855b72ada07d8b4,Why do farmers go marching?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/why-do-farmers-go-marching/article23351136.ece,2018-03-26,,The Hindu,"Why are Indian farmers perpetually in revolt? The question has been raised by many after the recent farmers march to Mumbai and simmering rebellions across the States in recent years.No doubt, agriculture is one segment of the economy on which vote-conscious governments havent skimped on outlays. Over the years, Central governments have allocated ever-rising sums towards procurement, input subsidies and rural employment schemes, while States have periodically announced loan waivers.But that farmer protests have persisted, and even intensified, perhaps shows that many of these schemes arent addressing the right set of problems. The reasons for agricultural distress have changed quite dramatically in recent years.From shortage to plentyA few years ago, farmers seeking to register their protest used to do so beside wilted crops and parched farmlands.But in the last couple of years, farmers from Mandsaur to Salem have given vent to their angst by dumping vast quantities of unsold produce  tomatoes, grapes, onions and milk  on lakebeds and national highways.Historically, agricultural distress in India has been linked to truant monsoons, input shortages and lacklustre yields which frequently put growers on the road to penury.In recent years though, it is surplus output and unremunerative prices that have decimated farm incomes more often.Trends in Indias agricultural output over the last twenty years present an eye-opener to this problem of plenty.For an extended period from 1998-99 to 2009-10, Indias rice output stayed stuck at 85 million tonnes to 95 million tonnes, with drought years such as 2002 and 2004 seeing sharp downward blips.As consumption hovered at 80 to 90 million tonnes in this period, shortages were more frequent than surpluses.But after climbing to 105 million tonnes in 2011-12, Indias rice production has stayed well above the 100 million-tonne mark for the last six years, even scaling110 million tonnes in 2016-17. With offtake still stuck at about 90 million tonnes, theres been persisting excess stock in the market. As a result, in the last five years, wholesale prices of paddy have crept up at a 2.4% annual rate.The wheat story is similar. From a yearly average of about 75 million tonnes in the decade to 2010-11, wheat output leapfrogged to average 94 million tonnes in the last six years. Output, now at 97-98 million tonnes, is now neck-and-neck with domestic demand (about 100 million tonnes) and it may only be a matter of time before it overshoots it. With rising supplies, wholesale wheat prices have inched up at a 2% yearly rate in the last five years.Not too long ago, India was facing a severe shortage of pulses, with output struggling to keep up with the rising protein intake of the masses. But farmers have dramatically ramped up pulses production too. From an annual average of 14 million tonnes in the decade to 2010-11, it has averaged 18 lakh tonnes in the last six years. India harvested a record pulses crop of 23 million tonnes in 2017, matching the official demand estimate, thus dampening once-high market prices for a range of dals. This script of galloping surpluses dampening prices has played out in commercial crops such as sugarcane and tea too.If unremunerative prices have dogged other crops, fruit and vegetable farmers have been up against the high perishability of their produce. In the last fifteen years, India has doubled its potato output, trebled its tomato harvest and managed a fourfold increase in onion output. But poor storage facilities and State laws that keep farmers bound to their local mandis, have exposed farmers to wild swings in prices.Driving the outputIt is noteworthy that agricultural output has held up at relatively high levels in recent years, despite erratic monsoons. This could be because the droughts in 2014 and 2015 have been far less severe than those in 2009 or 2002.In 2014, a drought year, the country still harvested 105 million tonnes of rice, 86 million tonnes of wheat and 17 million tonnes of pulses. Hefty hikes in the Centres Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) have also had a big role to play in farmers ratcheting up output. In the last ten years, the support prices for wheat and paddy have risen 73% and 108% and those on pulses have trebled. In recent years, State governments have also competed furiously with the Centre, announcing bonuses and their own support prices for crops such as onions, tomatoes, potatoes and even green chillies.Illusory profitsIt is early days yet to say if recent improvements in Indias farm output are here to stay. But after responding enthusiastically to signals from MSPs for many years, farmers have lately found the mechanism failing them. Market prices for many crops have tended to plunge and stay below their official MSPs for extended periods.For one, though the Centre announces MSPs for 24 crops, the bulk of its procurement operations (via FCI) are restricted to just two  rice and wheat, with NAFED chipping in on pulses.State-level procurement operations are even more adhoc, lacking both direction and funding. Therefore, while a farmer may plant mustard, grapes or onions in any given year based on the MSP promise, theres really no guarantee that he will get that price when he visits the mandi.Two, even in crops where the Centre or State agencies are active, their market interventions tend to be too selective and sporadic to make any real difference to a majority of farmers. Despite the Centre doubling down on procurement in 2017-18, it will mop up only about a third of Indias rice and wheat output and a tenth of the pulses harvest. So, if good monsoons result in more crops moving into surplus zone, market forces will continue to prevail over MSPs.Three, given that the Centres market interventions on rice and wheat have proved so ineffectual despite large spends, it is unclear how the Centre or copycat States will fund MSPs in a host of other crops.New fixesTo be fair, the NDA has been trying out new policy fixes to address such problems. It is piloting price deficiency payments in place of MSPs to compensate farmers for price-related losses.It plans to replace input subsidies with direct cash transfers. It has kick-started a national electronic market for produce and is nudging States to repeal their APMC Acts, which prevent farmers from selling in markets of their choice.But its aggressive inflation-fighting efforts and on-off trade policies still work to the detriment of farmers. In the last couple of years, despite supply gluts, the Centre has continued with sizeable imports of wheat and pulses at low tariffs.Handling of spikesSeasonal spikes in prices of sugar, atta or rice are often met with export taxes, minimum export prices or even outright export bans.States, on their part, continue to be quite adamant about levying high taxes and hanging on to the draconian mandis, which force farmers to rely heavily on middlemen.This puts the Indian farmer in a Heads I win, tails you lose situation. If market prices of crops hit rock-bottom, the government is helpless to rescue them. But if prices soar, the government prevents them from making hay by clamping down.All this makes it clear why Indian farmers are seething. Its for the same reason that salaried employees are often unhappy. Who would like being rewarded peanuts, after being highly productive?"
5b149bfc9855b72e9ad64eb5,Farmers gain from Israeli agriculture technology,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/farmers-gain-from-israeli-agri-tech/articleshow/62451023.cms,2018-01-11,,The Times Of India,"AHMEDABAD: Kalpesh Patel, a farmer in Prantij , earlier made Rs 4 lakh growing cabbage and cauliflower on his 16 bighas of land. Today, from the same produce on the same land, he earns Rs 15 lakh. The secret to his nearly three-fold rise in income is the new Israeli hi-tech protective cultivation and precision farming method.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu will visit Patel and his facility later this week. Patel is not alone. Some 50,000 farmers like him have reaped the benefits of the Centre of Excellence for Protective Cultivation and Precision Farming on Vegetables. The centre at Vadrad village in Sabarkantha district has played a pivotal role in extension of the Indo-Israel Agriculture Plan (IIAP) to 50,000 farmers in the 30 months since it was set up.The Vadrad centre is one of eight in the state, set up in collaboration with Israel. Jitendra Patel, the deputy director for horticulture, who is in charge of the centre, says that the centre is set to demonstrate the technology to farmers and extend it to them, increasing their income.Jitendra Patel said the Vadrad centre raises pest and disease-free saplings at the nominal price of Re 1 per sapling from farmers seeds and hands back saplings to be transplanted in fields. The Vadrad centre has been developed under IIAP at a cost of Rs 11.47 crore. It is focusing on protected cultivation of vegetables.The project has four high-tech temperature and moisture-controlled polyhouses or nurseries, where seedlings are grown for a fortnight under protection till they reach a certain height. Technologies like drip irrigation, protective cultivation of germinated seedlings and a precise mixture of soil and vermicompost are used, which lead to savings on fertilizer costs further on. The seedlings so produced are of high quality and disease-free.Patel said that because of the centre, farmers also get their crop before the trading season begins and consequently, better prices. With the produce arriving a fortnight before others, the farmer earns twice as much as he would in the middle of the season. The quality of vegetables also improves, with the minimal use of chemicals. He added that the fertilizer costs are cut by 70%.Kalpesh Patel, the farmer from Prantij, says, If we choose conventional sowing, there is a fear of damage to the crop. If we sow seed directly in the field, about 25% do not germinate and this is also a direct loss. In the first month, we have to spray insecticide on three or four times, to save seedling from pests and insects. With the seedling developed at the centre, I save on pesticides. During the monsoon, delayed rains can damage growth and hence if I opt for a 30-day seedling, there is no damage even if the rains are delayed.Ahmedabad: In Kadi and Kalol, it is not only the usual tomato, but now also cabbage and cauliflower which is drawing traders from Delhi. Officials of the horticulture department said around 10 traders would would usually go to Kadi or Kalol, are now camping in Prantij, despatching cabbage and cauliflower consignments to Delhi. Officials said about one truckload of cabbage and cauliflower is sent to Delhi every day. Demand for cauliflower is high in north India and traders coming to Kadi and Kalol are also setting up centres in Prantij.Mamroli Grad Turns Farmer, Taps Israeli Ideas For Huge ProfitsAhmedabad: Samir Patel, a B.Sc. in chemistry, has decided to adopt farming as his full-time profession. On a cue from the Centre of Excellence for protected cultivation and precision farming in Vadrad village, he has set up his own nursery. The turnover of his nursery per annum is around Rs 1.5 crore.Patel, a resident of Mamroli, said he was always interested in farming with the latest technology. When I learnt about the centre, I was the first farmer to utilise its services, he said.I still remember that I gave the seeds of bitter gourd (karela) for seeding and, after I received the benefits, I came to the centre and studied the technology in detail, Samir Patel said.He said that he had 25 bighas of land and had taken another 330 bighas in the area on lease. In the year 2014, his profits after deducting the expenses came to around Rs 20 lakh.After adopting Israeli technology, my income had grown and now I make a net profit of around Rs 60 lakh, Samir said.He further said that he was now into farming of potatoes, bitter gourd, tomato, chillis, brocolli, red cabbage and cauliflower, among others. He further said that he had also entered into contract for potato farming with some big multinationals.Regarding the nursery that had been set up on the lines of the Vadrad centre, he said that he had grown seeds at the government centre at Vadrad and had a turnover of Rs 1.5 crore from this nursery alone.Patel further said that his farming had grown so large in scale that now even his wife Daxa had to assist him in taking care of the nursery."

But this year the winter mist has been severe and has affected several other crops too, says R Moorthy, a farmer from Velliyangadu in Karamadai.Moorthy said he had planted jasmine, tuberose and curry leaves in his field. Tuberose crop used to yield 40kg of flowers, but this winter, it has come down to 10kg on average, he says. Curry leaves production has halved to 5kg per acre, he adds. The leaves of tuberose yellow in winter, reducing the crops productivity and also the tender shoots of curry leaves wither in the mist.Flowers traders said the prices of flowers have skyrocketed in the local markets. KK Ayyappan, treasurer of flower market in the city, said the same season last year jasmine price was Rs 1,000 per kg. This year the inflow has been badly hit. And also Friday being a muhurtham day, the prices have touched Rs 2,400 a kilogram, he says.Ayyappan also said inflow of other flowers including rose, sevvanthi, arali, vaadamalli, kozhikkondai and kakatan malli, which were majorly traded in the market, had fallen. On ordinary days the market sees an inflow of 50 tonnes of flowers in total. In festive season it goes up to 200 tonnes. On Thursday the market got only 10 tonnes of flowers in total, he says.Similarly, vegetables like brinjal, tomato, ladies finger and green chilly have seen a dip in production in winter, say farmers.Winter is a very unfavourable season for these crops, says P Kandasamy, district secretary of farmers association. In winter a fungal disease called adi sambal noi (peronospora) affects production of these crops, he adds. But the prices of these vegetables have not seen a raise as of now, he adds.S Panneerselvam, head of Agro Climate Research Centre, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, said, till the third week of January, there would be mist formation, which would affect the cultivation of certain crops, especially flowers like jasmine.After the third week of January, there would be no mist formation and we could expect the jasmine production to go up, he added."

On Wednesday (March 28), the price stood at Rs. 7.20. However, it jumped to Rs. 12.80 per kg on Thursday. Incidentally, the price has plummeted to Rs. 2 a kg and even below at several markets in southern States.Chairman of the Madanapalle tomato market committee R. Gurappa Naidu said since November, the price had not gone down below Rs. 5, which was a unique thing in the annals of the local market. The peak season would commence with April, with stocks of about 800 tonnes a day reaching the market, as against the current supply of around 200 tonnes, he said.ExportsWe are expecting large-scale exports from April 15, as Madanapalle market will alone remain stable thanks to congenial climate for tomato cultivation in the country. Generally, there will be a high demand for the Madanapalle varieties in the northern States from the start of summer in view of the long shelf life and taste. The demand will continue till July, he said."

Satish KumarAt a time when all things organic is the buzzword, poly-houses are becoming a cause for concern due to high pesticide residues in the produce following indiscriminate use of chemicals.In fact, the sustainability of poly-house cultivation is facing a threat as a sizeable number of them have closed due to soil degradation and attack by nematodes  harmful soil bacteria  and fungi, which have resulted in massive devastation of crops.The Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR) has now come out with a series of technologies and practices to reduce the use of chemicals in poly-house cultivation.The main focus is to turn the high-end poly-house cultivation into a sustainable farm and economic activity, said M.S. Rao, head of IIHRs Division of Entomology and Nematology.This will result in not only production of pesticide-free produce, but it will go a long way in improving the financial health of poly-houses, he said, while indicating that closing down poly-houses would result in a loss of Rs. 900 crore.What has come as a shot in the arm for the IIHR is that a 24-year-old farmer Raju in Doddaballapur taluk near Bengaluru has used this technology showing it is possible to grow broccoli, a crop highly susceptible to various pests and diseases, without pesticides.It is the first time in the country that broccoli has been grown in a chemical-free manner in a poly-house.Of course, the experiment is not completely organic as the farmer has used a certain amount of fertilizers. But, the produce has been selling like hot cakes to exporters at a premium price since it is pesticide-free.Mr. Raju, who migrated to Karnataka from Andhra Pradesh, took up poly-house cultivation on about one acre of land in Doddaballapur, of which broccoli is grown on half an acre.What has enthused scientists is that he has trounced the general perception that chemical-free farming and reduction in fertilizers would lead to drop in yield. The farmers yield has not only increased by about 30% by using the natural plant growth promoters as well as bio-fertilisers and bio-pesticides of IIHR, but the cost of cultivation too has dropped by about 30% as he has not used chemicals and pesticides. He was able to earn about Rs. 4.18 lakh in 90 days.Dr. Rao said the farmer used bio fungicide, bio nematicide, bio bactericide, bio fertilizers, neem and pongamia soaps as well as plant growth promoters developed by the IIHR.It has helped improve soil fertility and reduce soil-borne pathogens.If a farmer uses these chemical-free and cost-effective applications for two to three years, there is no need for soil enrichment for the next five years, he said. Biotechnologist-turned entrepreneur J. Gavaskar, who has taken licences from the IIHR to mass produce and also sell some of its bio technologies, says the awareness among farmers is slowly increasing about such bio applications. Big farmers and some Farmer Producers Organisations from Pune, some cities in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala are trying out these chemical-free applications, he said.Other successesDr. Rao said ICAR-IIHR has demonstrated similar success stories in capsicum, European cucumber, tomato, gerbera, carnations grown under protected conditions in various poly-houses and guava, pomegranate, tomato, okra, brinjal, tuberose grown under open field conditions in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra, and Bengal."

Chicken, beef, mutton, lamb, pork  you name it and we gorge on it. We love meat, says 78-year-old Pamela Rebeiro, as she escorts us down the narrow, cool corridor of her Collin Street house. Pamela, who is an Anglo-Indian, is a fantastic cook, quite known within the community. Even our aloo chops are meat croquettes coated with potato. Aloo just got a bit of lip-service! she laughs.Pamela is among the last few of a vanishing tribe of middle-aged or older women who know the secrets of Anglo-Indian cuisine  one of the most prominent pillars of Kolkatas diverse culinary heritage. In and around Ripon Street, Elliott Road and other Anglo-Indian bastions in central Kolkata, women like Pamela bent over bubbling pots and pans and red-hot ovens as they dished out delicacies like juicy jalfrezi, tangy pepper water, rich ball curry, yellow rice, pantras and more. Lunch after Sunday service was an elaborate affair as the lanes would fill up with the rich aromas as families congregated around the table over food, conversation and maybe some music later in the afternoon. Much of that magic is gone, with flickers of that life and lifestyle surviving in corners like Bow Barracks.There was a time when I used to cook for many, many people. We used to host parties almost every day. My husband, Rubin Rebeiro, was a musician, who used to play at Princes in Grand Hotel. He used to have hundreds of visitors. Ours was a buzzing house. Today, I live alone as my son works in Hyderabad and I dont feel like cooking for myself. However, hes got married and my daughter-in-law will be staying with me; so things may change, says Pamela.People who grew up in and around central Kolkata have a deep connection with the community and its food. There was a mansion in front of my Beniapukur house in which lived four or five Anglo-Indian families. One of them was Mr Jardine, recalls actor-musician-director Anjan Dutt , whos had a strong association with the community since childhood. He had a very beautiful daughter, Alison, and I liked her a lot. I was very young then. They used to make some amazing kofta curry and yellow rice. The smell used to drift to our house and I used to gorge on the food. I dont know if it was because of my tender age, or my strong admiration for Alison, but the mind-blowing flavour of that food is etched in my mind. I have never tasted any other plate of ball curry-yellow rice tastier than that. Now, they are all gone, the director adds.There are not many families left, to start with, says Reethu Sarawgi, a septuagenarian retired teacher of La Martiniere for Girls, Kolkata. The Anglo-Indian community felt isolated after Independence. Almost all my friends left by the early 60s for the UK, Canada and Australia , she adds. Reethu feels her food habits have been influenced by her friends or her hostel life in school. If you went to a school that is under the Church of North India, you would develop a love for Anglo food. I remember the delicious sausage curry and country captain  dry beef curry  made by a dear friend of mine, Yvonne Pinto, who passed away recently. I will never forget that taste, rues Reethu, who is a Malayali by birth but grew up with Anglo-Indian friends, and still savours Anglo food almost every day.But it is not just the exodus, there are other factors to it too, says Anjan. The wine-and-dine culture of Park Street died a sad death due to the heavy entertainment tax. Once my friend, musician Nondon Bagchi, and I held an informal survey and counted around 600 entertainers on Park Street  musicians, cabaret dancers, singers and so on. The whole lot of those people left, and with them, their culture also left, the director adds.However, Anglo-Indian cuisine has never really been part of restaurant business in Kolkata. There are places that serve one or two items like jalfrezi and roast, but eateries dedicated to the cuisine have been a rarity. Traditionally, the authentic food is cooked in almost every Anglo household even today. A family lunch will mean a week-long preparation involving shopping for meat, marinating it with right ingredients, buying dill and other herbs and then finally preparing it, which could go on for a couple of days.While we definitely love other cuisines, we eat Anglo-Indian food almost every day at our house. I had yellow rice and ball curry today, and yesterday mashi (the cook, a lady from Nadia) made pantras. My daughters are equally happy if they have pasta for dinner but our generation is a bit more traditional and we love our food, says Barry OBrien, quizmaster and president-in-chief of The All-India Anglo-Indian Association . We Anglo-Indians take our food very seriously. Families swear by their cook, who used to be called boy, khansama or bowchi (derived from bawarchi). In my childhood, we used to have a fantastic cook, Appana Rao, who was from the Andhra-Odisha border. I remember, we never used to take packed lunch to our school, St Xaviers, as it would get cold. Appana used to cook and the fresh hot lunch in tiffin carriers would be brought to school, recalls Barry.Also, Anglo-Indians have a special inclination for leftover food. Cooking a little extra is our kitchen culture, mainly for two reasons  to cater to sudden, wanted or unwanted, guests, and to relish the dish a day later, says Barry. By far my favourite breakfast over the years has been quarter-boiled eggs, (not half-boiled, not hard-boiled!) mashed with aloo chops from dinner the night before, he adds.A family lunch can mean a week-long preparation and daylong cooking. Our families are closely knit. We still try and meet on every occasion for a large meal. Typical Anglo families still carry on this tradition, says Christine Beaucasin, who works at the Oral School for Deaf Children. Our parties are still incomplete without jalfrezi, vindaloo, pantras, roasts and so on, she adds.But are there shops dedicated to Anglo-Indian groceries? Not really. We use a lot of onions, ginger, garlic, tomato. You can buy them from anywhere, really. For meat and the sausages, we go to New Market or Entally bazar, says Christina Samuel. We usually have an elaborate three course meal  soup, side dishes and desserts. Each day of the Christmas holiday season has been extremely busy for us. We were either invited to someones place for lunch or dinner or some friends or family visited us, says Christina. While the tradition of cooking runs in family, tedious items like ball curry and butt curry are going out of fashion, she says.Is the younger generation a tad reluctant to carry forward the cuisine of the community? While a section of the older generation thinks so, many of the youngsters dont agree. Our food is a family affair. It passes from one generation to the next. I love to cook. I make fantastic steaks. Anglo men are usually good cooks as they love to eat, quips Joshua Samuel, Christinas 32-year-old son.Brandon Claudius, son of hockey player Olympian Leslie Claudius agrees. I dont get time every day due to my erratic work hours but I am also a foodie. Korma, bhuni vindaloo  I love to eat and I love to cook for my family, he says. His wife, Jilian, too, cooks Anglo food almost every day at home. There are many Anglo-Indian snacks including kul kul and rose cookies that we used to make at home before Christmas. Now, we buy them from the market as those are very elaborate, she adds.However, for those who are reluctant to cook, you have home delivery. Ive never enjoyed cooking and Ive never cooked. Ive always sourced my food from reliable home deliveries. And more often than not, I get Anglo food, says Reethu.Veronica Pacheco, a retired service woman, delivers lunch and dinner to around 15 families every day. They are all retired people. I have a dabbawala who delivers the lunch boxes to them. The menu is simple  rice, dal, sabzi and one non-veg item of fish, beef or pork, she tells us. Apart from the retired households, Veronica also delivers to the clubs that serve Anglo-Indian food on special occasions. Usually at Bingo parties, I prepare food for around 150 people. I served everywhere  Dalhousie Institute, Calcutta Rangers Club, Armenian Club and all. I prepare thorough Anglo-Indian food  aloo chops, shami beef tikias, pantras, cutlets, pork roast, tongue roast. My father, Vivian George Thompson was a very good cook and he taught me. When I lost my husband in 2012, I started feeling a bit lonely and so I chose to engage myself like this, says Veronica, who stays alone as her son works in Melbourne.If you havent tasted Anglo-Indian sausages, you are missing out on a slice of life Kolkata has to offer. These hard-core pork sausages are far from the skinny machine-made Frankfurters you get at shopping mall freezers. Anglo-Indian sausages are stuffed with onion, ginger, aromatic herbs and sets of secret spice mixes apart from mince. We make our own masala. From the garam masalas to haldi and coriander  we grind them to make it perfect, says Bablu Khatik who runs Chamans Pork Shop at Park Circus market with his brother Rahul and uncle Sunil. Cooking the sausages also involves a unique process. You dont need to grill or fry them; as they need boiling for at least 40 minutes. Here is a small tip for you.

Some airlines are embracing the idea of healthier flying, offering calorie-conscious menus and new exercise videos.According to Beth McGroarty, research director for The Global Wellness Institute, a non-profit organisation for the wellness industry, even as seats shrink and flights get more crowded, many carriers want air travel to be more bearable (and even enjoyable). They believe wellness is the way to do that. Its part of the larger wellness movement happening in the travel industry, she says.More democraticAnd, unlike the usual trend of ramping up onboard amenities for only their first- and business-class customers and stripping them away for passengers in economy, Ms. McGroarty says that no passengers are left out in this recent wellness push. Wellness in the air, in many instances, is more democratic.All customers on United Airlines and JetBlue have access to the popular digital meditation service Headspace as a part of their in-flight entertainment. JetBlues Headspace content includes videos that address travel topics such as fear of flying and difficulty sleeping upright.Among international carriers, Swiss Air offers Headspace onboard long-haul flights, and British Airways has a Well Being channel on its in-flight entertainment systems that includes meditation and stretching exercises. Hong Kong-based carrier Cathay Pacific recently launched six in-flight videos, called Travel Well With Yoga, in a partnership with Pure Yoga, the popular yoga studio chain. Videos are between five and 20 minutes, and feature yoga and meditation exercises such as hip and back stretches and deep breathing.Passenger surveysAmerican Airlines started prioritising wellness after conducting customer surveys and running focus groups with fliers about what they want. We learned that our passengers care a lot about their well-being, says Nick Richards, the companys director of customer experience.According to Americans research, travellers wanted to sleep more soundly in the skies, and to that end, the airline recently tapped mattress and bedding brand Casper to design pillows, blankets and other products that are supposed to help with a more comfortable sleep. Premium economy passengers receive a lumbar pillow and a soft cotton blanket while the Casper amenities for international first- and business-class passengers include mattress pads, pillows, blankets and pyjamas.Tucking inMental well-being and sleep aside, airlines are also incorporating wellness onboard by offering healthier food and drink options.Turkish Airlines, for instance, has a new Fly Good Feel Good campaign that includes a menu of herbal teas such as one with rooibos, sage and lavender to help relieve stress and promote sleep. Another is an energising blend with mate, mint and ginger. Children are offered a traditional Turkish drink with milk, carob powder and date syrup thats meant to strengthen the bones.In January, TAP Air Portugal tapped five Michelin-starred Portuguese chefs to create low-calorie Portuguese-influenced entrees for its business-class passengers. Those entrees will also be offered to economy passengers starting this summer, says Joel Fragata, head of the airlines in-flight products.Jos Avillez, of the two Michelin-starred Lisbon restaurant Belcanto, crafted a stone bass in tomato and onion stew, along with coriander and basil potatoes for TAPs flyers while Henrique S Pessoa, of the Michelin-starred Alma, also in Lisbon, came up with a lemongrass and ginger chicken curry.A handful of domestic, American carriers, too, are encouraging mindful eating. Dr. Charles Platkin, a nutrition and public health advocate, and the director of the Hunter College NYC Food Policy Center, conducts an annual airline food study where he analyses the economy food of every domestic carrier.NY Times"

The seven-member team, who have been successfully raising quality seedlings in the rain shelter installed at the office compound, now boasts of a strong clientele.We supplied around 2,000 seedlings today and there are times we struggle to keep up with the demand. People come from far off places and often, we have to give seedlings with just the first signs of green, says Thulasi Bhai, one of the members.The Chittumala block panchayat launched the project last year in a bid to avoid chemical-laced vegetables and promote organic farming in every household. Hybrid seeds were procured from College of Agriculture, Vellayani, to ensure 100% germination. All the seven women underwent training at a seed farm where they were taught how to grow seedlings in a scientific manner using organic compost. We provided the infrastructure along with trays and seeds and the seedlings are grown in a mix of coco peat and vermicompost. The saplings are priced Rs. 3 each and we are also planning to open a counter to sell them, says Aji Abraham, womens welfare officer who coordinated the project.Functioning under the guidance of Agricultural Assistant Director T.A. Kalpana, the agro farm offers spinach, eggplant, tomato, okra, green chilly, capsicum and beans seedlings.Along with seedlings, the group members are also growing a vegetable garden in the block panchayat compound.Recently we got around 50kg of green chilly and since it is organic, the product had many takers. Currently, we are in the process of preparing land so that we could grow more vegetables with the onset of rains, says Thulasi. Saniya Aby, Hymavathy Amma, Krishnakumari, Sharada, Jessy and Sindhu are the other members of the Gramasree team."

The same crate on Friday sold for Rs 300 more, almost a five-time high in a day. Similarly, the wholesale price of Shimla Mirch (capsicum) was Rs 50 for 15 kgs on Thursday. On Friday, it was being sold for Rs 225 per 15 kgs, again a five-time hike.A similar hike was seen in the prices of several vegetables because of the 10-day nationwide agitation by farmers that started Friday. During this period, farmers have announced to go on leave and will not supply vegetables and milk in cities. In Punjab, three out of 11 farmers organisations are supporting the stir. One can well imagine what would be the picture in the coming 10 days, said Rohit Sharma, a vegetable trader at Maqsudan.Mandeep Singh, another vegetable trader at the same market, said the retail consumer is sure to be hit hard.A retailer from vegetable market at Partap Bagh area said, Because of the transportation charges in carrying vegetables from wholesale to retail markets, our margins are high.Subhash, who owns a vegetable shop in Mai Hiran Gate area, echoes his view. Meanwhile, several farmers were seen moving on tractors in the city today and stopping others farmers not supporting the agitation from supplying vegetables and milk to city areas. The protesting farmers also created a ruckus at Maqsudan mandi by throwing away vegetables bough by traders from farmers in bulk.

(Express Photo by Sahil Walia) Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar. (Express Photo by Sahil Walia)Opposition Congress and INLD on Sunday launched a scathing attack on the Khattar led BJP government alleging every section was fed up with its misrule.In separate news conferences here, Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda and INLDs Abhay Singh Chautala targeted the state government over a host of issues including those on farmers, employees, youth and players. Hooda said Manohar Lal Khattar governments Bhavantar Bharpayee Yojana, launched to protect the growers in the event of crash in prices, had failed to yield results. He said recently farmers at many places had been forced to throw their tomato crops on roads or give them to the Gaushalas.The government did not come to the rescue of tomato farmers when prices crashed. They have not got any benefit under this Yojana, the former chief minister claimed. On the players issue, he said: The government first cancelled the awards ceremony and afterwards has been coming out with contradictory statements regarding honouring them. They are not clear which policy they have to follow and players are being disrespected. He was also asked about the state government suspending Haryana Staff Selection Commission chairman B B Bharti after a row over an objectionable question pertaining to Brahmins, in an examination conducted by the board.Hooda said there was no provision to suspend HSSC chairman and the government should either dismiss him or ask him to resign. He said, moreover, the state government too should be held equally responsible as it was not a mere mistake in a question paper but an insult to the entire Brahmin community. Hooda also asked the government to immediately resolve the issue of ongoing strike by the sanitation workers. While this government keeps talking so much about Swachh Bharat and Swachh Haryana, it is making no efforts to end the 10-day old strike which has resulted in heaps of garbage being piled up and inconvenienced the citizens he stated.Meanwhile, INLDs senior leader Abhay Singh Chatuala, while addressing another news conference, demanded the Khattar government issue a white paper on the five foreign trips undertaken by the Chief Minister and those part of his entourage on different occasions giving full details. Chautala said that while the government has claimed that investments worth over Rs 7 lakh crore had fructified as a result of MoUs signed with various governments and other agencies during these trips, the white paper should detail how much revenue has actually been garnered out of these investments.Chautala, who is Leader of Opposition in the State Assembly, also said that the Chief Minister had claimed that lot of wasteful expenditure has been incurred as part of hospitality expenses during Hoodas tenure. ..then it is the responsibility of the present government to tell what steps are being taken to reclaim that money, he added. However, while reacting to this, Hooda said, if people come to meet the Chief Minister (during his time), it is his responsibility to offer them a cup of tea and snacks. But everyone knows that nobody comes to meet him (Khattar). If they have their way, the present government would even set up a Commission of Inquiry to go into how much tea and biscuits had been consumed on the hospitality that was extended. On criticism by Hooda to INLD-BSPs ongoing Jail Bharo Andolan on SYL canal issue, and his dubbing it as Bus Bharo Andolan, Chautala said,those coming from five star culture will not understand our agitation.Our leaders and workers have been courting arrest and authorities let us off in the evening saying they do not have any place to keep us in jails. Hooda had said that INLDs Jail Bharo Andolan on SYL was limited to getting on to the buses, courting arrest and getting released in the evening. Had they been serious, they would have actually gone to jail on this issue, Hooda said.On the developments in Karnataka, both Hooda and Chautala said B S Yedurappas resignation had thoroughly exposed the BJP, which allegedly wanted to encourage horse trading despite knowing they did not have numbers on their side to cobble up a majority.Replying to another question, Chautala said Mayawati-led third front will come into existence and the BSP supremo will be the countrys next prime minister after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

But traders say that in a months time, vegetables may turn dearer.Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra recorded a good yield of vegetables due to copious rainfall last year, said A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam.The produce was harvested simultaneously. Due to the good yield, the prices of many vegetables continue to be low. However, it may begin to increase soon. There may be no new yield due to summer and water shortage. The rising heat level will play a role in price rise. The quality of produce will also be affected, he said. As on Tuesday, a kg of onions from Andhra Pradesh was priced at Rs. 10 to Rs. 12, while onions supplied from Maharashtra were priced at Rs. 12 to Rs. 15 depending on size, variety and quality, he added.Tomatoes were priced at Rs. 8 per kg. In fact, last week, the price ranged from Rs. 5 to 10, he pointed out. Potatoes cost Rs. 20 to Rs. 22, while small onions were priced at Rs. 20 to Rs. 25.The rates of a few vegetables have been on the rise. The cost of beans has increased from Rs. 10-Rs. 15 nearly 15 days ago to Rs. 40 now. Beans and cauliflower are easily perishable during summer. Cauliflower is priced at Rs. 20 to Rs. 30 a piece, he added. Another vegetable that has turned costlier is the local thorny brinjal. Last week, a kg was priced in the range of Rs. 10 to 12. In the last two to three days, the rate has been on the rise and today a kg costs Rs. 40, he added.The prices of other vegetables (per kg) are  carrot Rs. 15, ladys finger Rs. 15 to Rs. 20, drumstick Rs. 15 to Rs. 20, snake gourd Rs. 15, bitter gourd Rs. 25, radish Rs. 10 to Rs. 15, green chillies Rs. 15 to Rs. 20, ginger Rs. 30 to Rs. 40 and coriander Rs. 20 to Rs. 25, according to Mr. Balu."

With the peak summer days round the corner, the cost of several vegetables is slowly on the rise.Traders at the Koyambedu wholesale market noted that the prices of vegetables were steadily increasing since the last week of March. While some vegetables are costlier by up to 40 % compared to last month, most of them are priced at least 20 % more. However, many merchants reported brisk sales due to the festive season.Beans, broad beans and tomatoes are among the costly vegetables this season. While one kg of beans is sold for nearly Rs. 55 depending on the quality, broad beans are priced at Rs. 50 a kg in the wholesale market. These vegetables are sold for Rs. 65-Rs. 70 a kg at the retail market.Some residents like Sivagami B., a resident of Anna Nagar, use green vegetables from their home garden more often to deal with runaway increase in prices.According to wholesale traders at Koyambedu, the citys hub of perishable goods, some staple vegetables such as potato, onion and small onions remain affordable. Drumsticks are among the few seasonal vegetables that are cheaper.P. Sukumar, treasurer, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants Welfare Association, said the prices of vegetables begin to increase in April as yield would be less due to depleting groundwater sources. Even vegetables like chayote (chow chow) that are priced within Rs. 15 a kg are costly as the market did not receive its share from Karnataka. The demand for cucumber and lime has also pushed the prices up this week.The Koyambedu market receives 320 truckloads of produce daily, which is nearly 80 trucks less compared to March.We dont expect a steep hike like last March as there is sporadic rainfall across the State now and also in Karnataka.

But he did not do so for the first 25 eggs. We were unsuccessful in incubating them in our facility too. The father incubated only five eggs of which four hatched and one is still in process. The chicks were born on April 7 and moved to the hospital immediately. Parent-birds may not allow constant monitoring of chicks or may neglect them, even trampling upon them. Besides, the chicks are susceptible to infection.In 2016, Byculla Zoo saw thousands of visitors each day coming to see the newly-acquired Humboldt penguins. The penguins are still the star attraction despite the management charging an entry fee. The zoo has always had emu birds, a variety native to Australia. The zoo had two females and one male, and one of these pairs gave birth to a chick around three years ago, followed by the four chicks last month. The parent-birds had laid 30 eggs, of which only these four survived.Emu birds are flightless but are known to be the second largest birds after the ostrich. They can grow up to six feet in height and weigh up to 50 kg.The chicks are doing well and are active, said hospital authorities. They are being fed green salads, bird feed, tomatoes, fruits, boiled eggs and sprouts. Their weight is recorded everyday.Dr. Sanjay Tripathi, Director of Byculla zoo, said, When they will be brought to the enclosure for public viewing is a decision doctors will take.

A sum of Rs. .9.64 lakh was provided for the purpose.Five self-help groups (SHGs), including three womens groups, have been constituted under the project and each group consists of 10 to 14 members. All expenses  including the rent of land, seeds, organic manure, pump sets for irrigation, agricultural implements, and wages  were borne by the department.Our produce is in good demand among the consumers as our farming methods are transparent and can be viewed by anyone, says A.

Our efforts are now focussed on consolidating our position and market share in Complan, said HIPL managing director Sankalp Potbhare in an interaction, declining to comment on future product line-ups.In India, Complan is a 50-year-old brand, offering milk-based nutrition beverage. It was learnt that Complans market share had slipped to single digit for various reasons over the last few years.Bulk of HIPLs (also known as Kraft Heinz) Indian revenues are from Glucon-D (more than 40%), followed by more than 30% from Complan. The rest are from other segments.Mr. Potbhare said that the companys Rs. 6,000-crore milk food drink (MFD) segment comprised brands like Horlicks and Boost, Bournvita and Complan besides some local brands.

5b1538339855b76a5f1a07a0,Fruit of labour eludes farmers,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/fruit-of-labour-eludes-farmers/article23790028.ece,2018-05-06,,The Hindu,"Vegetable prices have remained nearly constant for the past decade at Rythu Bazaars, data sourced from Rythu Bazaar website shows. Except for a brief bump in 2017 when tomato prices touched Rs. 85 during summer, the prices have fluctuated in a narrow band of Rs. 6 and Rs. 20, occasionally going up to Rs. 30. What this means for farm income can be easily guessed.Vegetable prices, even for a perishable item like tomatoes, are a product of demand and supply. When both are nearly constant, the price will remain constant. The produce that reaches Hyderabad is not just local. Farmers from far flung districts like Madanapalle, Vizag and Chittoor also get their produce here. That benefits the consumers who pay between Rs. 10 and Rs. 14 per kilo for tomatoes, says B. Babu, Deputy Director, Horticulture Department, Rangareddy.At the Rythu Bazaar in Mehdipatnam, the buzz begins early in the morning with farmers bringing their produce in wicker baskets or neatly packed in colourful plastic tubs. At around 9 a.m., the estate officer goes and with a piece of chalk, marks the prices on the green signboard. It sets off a noisy cacophony as the farmers and traders begin an earnest conversation. As the shoppers troop in, it is business time as the farmers disappear and the traders take charge. I have been bringing my vegetables from Chevella for the past five years. I dont remember getting more than Rs. 10 per kilo for tomatoes. Sometimes, I have sold by number of baskets without being aware of the number of kilos, says Bharat Reddy, who cultivates tomatoes on his one-acre patch.Farm labourThe near-flat vegetable prices have had their impact on farm labour as well, as can been seen from a recent Reserve Bank of India paper Rural Wage Dynamics in India: What Role does Inflation Play? It used farm and non-farm wages as a take off point: There has been a sustained sluggishness in rural wage growth in the more recent period (post 2012-13), with the fall in agricultural wage growth being higher than non-agricultural wages.For agriculture produce, even the cost is not being covered. Last year, there was big buzz about chilli prices. Indias contribution to the world chilli production is 37% with the two Telugu states contributing 57%. The output per acre has remained constant and the sale price has also remained constant for most vegetables aggravating farm sector distress, says Sarampally Malla Reddy of All India Kisan Sabha.Wholesale prices are being dictated by six big corporates who are able to control the price as they are the main canalising agencies for both import and export of agricultural produce, says Mr. Reddy.The low prices has also meant that the farmers are being left to their own devices as they can no longer afford to purchase inputs required to raise farm output. Tomato seeds cost Rs. 1 lakh per kilo. Farmers who cannot afford these are using old seeds for growing their crops. This is further lowering the yield. While the farm inputs have kept pace with inflation rising steadily, the price that the farmers are getting has not. This is leading to farm distress, reducing farmers to subsistence level, says Narasimha Reddy Donthi, an agriculture policy expert."

With the fishing ban in place, you can find them clinging to the boats as well now.Fishermen like Gurumoorthi, 30, who are good at diving, make some extra money using their skills to remain under water for extended periods.There are different kinds of mussels and all of them taste great if you use some chicken masala for cooking. The cleaning takes some skill. If it is not done properly, you will end up with a stomach ache, he said, shivering due to the cold water. Mr. Gurumoorthi cooks mussels and also scrapes them from their hiding places. Pressure cook them for a whistle and they will open up. Retain only the soft flesh, make some masala with tomatoes, onion, turmeric powder, garlic and ginger and add the flesh to it, he explained.Oxygen tanksA 50 kg bag of mussels is sold to exporters and hoteliers for Rs. 6,500, for which he and his father Devarajan, 57, spend a few hours in the water. If someone wants just a few, we dont use oxygen tanks and other equipment. But if it is going to be a bagful, then we take enough precautions, explained Mr. Devarajan. However, since there is no regulation and anyone who can dive can get the mussels, there are divers from Thoothukudi who come here on a regular basis and scrap whatever they can, leaving almost nothing for local divers.M.D. Dayalan of the Indian Fishermen Association said that if the Chennai Port Trust permits, mussels can be grown in the fishing harbour using coir ropes and cotton cloth.It would be a good livelihood option for fishermen, at least those who depend on traditional craft. Already mussels are grown in backwaters and in estuaries, he pointed out.There are different kinds of mussels and all of them taste great if you use some chicken masala for cooking"

Most of the villages in these mandals are rainfed and farmers are forced to depend on irrigation water sources.The State government sanctioned NTR Jalasiri Phase II programme in the financial year 2016-17 for small and marginal farmers where additional groundwater recharge is available. The programme essentially focusses on utilisation of available groundwater resources and to promote conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater duly adhering to the norms mentioned under the A.P. Water, Land and Trees Act-2002.Mallisala village of Jaggampeta mandal is rainfed and in upland areas and dependent on the irrigation water tanks with meagre irrigation water sources. Only sago, mango and cashew is grown by farmers in this region. All the wage seekers in the village are developing the natural resources, hereby increasing their standard of living with the wages earned through NREGS.Success storiesTirri Ramu, a 60-year-old farmer in Mallisala, with a land holding of three acres, mostly depends on seasonal rain, and grows mango and cashew. He dug a borewell and connected a solar pump to it at a cost of Rs. 25,000 against the original price of Rs. 4.5 lakh. He has grown about 250 mango plants, cashew and tomato as intercrop for the past two years. His income incresaed from Rs. 30, 000 to Rs. 80, 000 per annum.Farmers of Korukonda are another example of the success of NTR Jalasiri programme where the yield from paddy has almost doubled.Surampudi Narasimha Murthy, a poor farmer having three acres of land, was getting only 10 to 15 bags per acre as the area is rainfed and also upland area. Project Director of District Water Management Authority (DWMA) G. Rajakumari said that when Mr. Murthy approached them, the authority offered solar-based borewell for Rs. 25,000 by giving a subsidy of Rs. 4.25 lakh.Field staff of DWMA and local NREGS installed borewell and solar panels in Mr. Murthys paddy field last year. This year, the yield has almost doubled to 30 bags. Last year, I got only 15 bags in my field and because of solar pumpset this year, I got 30 bags of paddy with which I am so happy, Mr. Murthy added."

Set up by NGO Apni Rasoi of Chitrakoot, all work here is done by the women from the rural region. Usha, who was at the stall, said, Our sabzi uses very little oil and spices. Because of poverty in Bundelkhand, this has become the way of life. Our NGOs aim is to help women feel that their work of cooking can also earn them money, she said.Empowering women is actually the theme of the festival. None of our home cooks does this commercially.

The PMs irrigation schemes are helping farmers. We work to reform, perform and transform. We will solve every small problem you face, Modi said.The PM also said that farmers who grow vegetables and fruits like tomatoes, onions and potatoes (TOP) are the priority of the government. You all know how people used to wait in queues for urea, they even faced lathis. Urea is a portfolio handled by this citys son (H N Ananth Kumar). And therefore, there has been record production by farmers this time. The kind of sensitivity we have shown the farmers, has the Congress government ever shown that?

The Gujarat government also sought information about the government of Indias recent budget announcement to provide an MSP of 1.5 times input cost, to include such a scheme in the state budget as well. After the partys near rout in rural areas in the 2017 assembly elections, the party has become sensitive to farmers issues. The Rupani government is planning a series of actions to address agrarian problems.A senior government officer privy to the development said, The state government has decided to adopt a new scheme for farmers to provide a reasonable MSP, as has been implemented in Madhya Pradesh and Telangana. The Madhya Pradesh government has a Bhavantar scheme for farmers, under which farmers get the difference between the market price and MSP directly in their account and they can sell directly at market price. So the government does not need to buy and store it as do today, in the case of groundnut. A lot of government resources will be saved on hiring godowns and using the produce later.The government is also considering a new scheme like in Telangana, where the government provides part of the input cost to farmers before sowing. The third option is a hybrid of the Madhya Pradesh and Telangana models, to suit Gujarats needs. The government is waiting for a response from GOI. In case of a delay from GOI, the state government has decided to opt for both the models. We have also contacted Niti Aayog, which is working on a new country-wide formula for MSP, the source added."

The kitchen staple has finally settled to the normal average of Rs 15 to Rs 20 in retail markets.Mondays rate in Andheri (west), Borivli (east) and Vikhroli was Rs 16 to Rs 20.Vendors in Pali Market, Bandra, continued to charge Rs 30 to Rs 35 per kg. Matunga, too, was Rs 30. Gopal Gupta, a greengrocer , claimed he was unaware of the rates in Nashik , where wholesale prices are said to have crashed, but said he paid Rs 15 in Vashi for best quality tomatoes. Our customers scarcely ask prices. They only want superior quality items, he said.Wholesale trader J M Soni of Rishabh Traders said: We procure tomato directly from growing areas like Nashik, and indeed rates are Rs 4-6 per kilo. This has been a bumper crop year, because more states have begun to grow the crop. Rajasthan and UP have despatched large volumes, just like Karnataka and Maharashtra. Farmers may not be happy, but this is cyclical. Consumers are very pleased to get reasonably priced tomatoes."

According to Patanjali officials, the first units of the 234-acre food park in non-SEZ area will be commissioned in July this year and the first of the three plants will become fully operational in December. Work on food park in SEZ area and a third plant of ayurvedic products in non-SEZ area will start very soon. The first unit will process oranges.After taking over the food park land, the company had announced it will provide direct jobs to 10,000 people when all the three plants become functional. The first plant is expected to generate direct employment for 2,000 by December, said Patanjali officials.TOI visited the food park on Wednesday to find machinery worth hundreds of crores kept in the non-SEZ food park. The basic frame of the first plant made up of PEB (pre-erected building) has been erected. Sheets will be fixed on this structure to create walls of the plant. About 80% of the civil work will be completed by June.Sunil Gupta, senior general manager of Patanjali, said that about 85% of the machinery has been procured. The remaining machinery will be purchased when we are about to commission the plant. A large percentage of this machinery has been imported, he told TOI. Gupta further said that the company was investing Rs1,200 crore in the non-SEZ food park. This includes civil work, machinery, land cost, etc, he added.According to the official, Patanjali will manufacture a large number of products in the food park for domestic market. They include fruit juice, Indian gooseberry (aonla) candy, murabba (pickle), digestive tablets, hops, wheat flour, biscuits, ayurvedic juices, jams, ketchups and sharbats, he told TOI.Commenting on the capacity of the plant, he said, We will use 800 tonne oranges a day, 600 tonne of Indian gooseberry and 400 tonne of other fruits and vegetables like tomato, mango, bottle gourd (lauki), bitter gourd (karela), etc, each.The plant will be zero waste factory. Fruits and vegetables will be utilized 100%. Value added products will be made from the waste and rest will be fed to the boiler. For example we will make cosmetics and green tea from orange peel. We will also manufacture orange oil. The pomace will be fed to the boiler, Gupta said.The plant will also have zero liquid discharge. We will recycle the whole water we use. Costly machinery has been purchased for this purpose, the senior GM further said. Bhoomipujan of the food park was performed in September 2016 and production was expected to start in six months. The project was delayed due to a variety of reasons."

The dairy is currently paying Rs 570 per kg fat. Rajkot Dairy has also reduced the price by Rs 40 per kg fat in last one month and is currently paying Rs 540.Sarhad Dairy chairman Valji Humbal said, We are only following GCMMFs steps in price reduction. On February 8, prices will be further cut, but we wont reduce immediately. We will see how much we can pay. Otherwise, we have to reduce Rs 10 per kg fat more.The dairy procures 5 lakh litre per day (LLPD) from 50,000 farmers while Kutch produces 10 LLPD. Rajkot Dairy procures 4.75 LLPD milk.This year, GCMMF had received 22% more milk in terms of volume compared to last year. A month ago, GCMMF warned all its 17 milk producers unions not to procure extra milk. As a result, dairies across the state stopped registering new members. Rajkot Dairy has put one-day off in rotation every week as far as milk procurement is concerned in each of its 14 talukas.Dhiru Gandhi, a milk producer from Rapar in Kutch, said The dairy has already capped milk procurement and is now reducing the price of fat continuously. We have no option but to sell the milk to dairy because it is a perishable commodity and we cant store it. Private players also exploit by giving us low prices.Though the problem of surplus milk crops up every winter, this time the situation is more acute because of the drastic fall in price of skimmed milk powder (SMP). The production cost of 1kg SMP is Rs 240 while the market price is Rs 150 to Rs 160, which is why private players have stopped buying milk.GCMMF managing director R S Sodhi said, Surplus milk is a problem but we are paying more to farmers compared to last year. We have reduced a small amount but some dairies have reduced more than that. Milk comes in huge quantity and to restrict inflow they might have chosen more reduction. We expect demand to rise in summer.Dr B B Savalia, assistant research scientist of cattle breading farm at Junagadh Agriculture University (JAU), said Milk production will come down by 30% in summer while demand will rise. Therefore, the present problem wont escalate. Its a temporary phenomenon."

However, economists expect that the central bank would move to a more hawkish stance from the current neutral stance in the wake of growth bottoming out.We continue to expect the RBI to persist with its slightly hawkish pause in its Wednesday policy, from February, to err on the side of caution. That said, falling onion prices, after tomatoes, support our call that inflation risks are overdone, said Indranil Sen Gupta, economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch . According to Gupta, the MPC will see through the coming jump in inflation, growth and credit in mid-2018 as they are driven by base effects.Even without the central bank raising rates, lenders cost of funds has inched up as deposits slowed down and credit grew at a one-year high. Several large lenders, including State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank have hiked their bulk deposit rates. Private lender Axis Bank has also hiked its marginal cost of lending rate ( MCLR ) following an increase in cost of funds.According to DBS Bank chief economist Taimur Baig, growth has largely bottomed out, but India has yet to benefit from the synchronised pickup in global demand. The combination of fiscal challenges and rising oil prices would make the RBIs policy path a tricky one this year, in our view. Given Indias high debt and fiscal deficit, it may not be prudent to be on the sideline until inflation pressure becomes excessively high which, in turn, means the balance of risk is beginning to shift toward eventual policy tightening, he said.One of the factors that strengthen the case for a more hawkish regime has been the Union Budget , which unveiled a wider than expected fiscal deficit for the next year. But economists feel that the slippage is not enough to warrant a move to higher interest rates.Nomura economist Sonal Varma said, While the Budget is a slight disappointment relative to our expectations, it is not a game-changer in either direction  positive or negative. We expect a prolonged pause on monetary policy, including at the upcoming February 7 meeting, although the RBI may flag upside risks to inflation. She added that Nomura is yet to assess the impact of the government decision to hike minimum support prices (MSPs) on inflation and monetary policy outlook. The government has promised to increase the MSPs for crops by 1.5 times in the Budget.Benchmark 10-year bond yields have risen more than 80 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) since July  the biggest move since the 2013 rupee crisis, due in large part to worries about a more hawkish RBI."

When politicians trade barbs and innuendo on social networking sites, it translates to business as usual. The key is to inform voters, not rabble-rouse or flood them with babble. Politicians not only need to broadcast their views, but also listen to their voters. And that should be done intelligently.BENGALURU: The Congress on Monday distanced itself from its social media head Divya Spandanas controversial tweet that made a derogatory and personal attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi , soon after she came under flak.Divya alias Ramya, former Mandya MP, had on Sunday taken a dig at Modi, wondering if he was on pot (cannabis), a putdown which invited sharp criticism. The actor-turned-politicians swipe came following Modis comment at a rally here, during which he said farmers were his top priority and described TOP as tomato, onion and potato. Is this what happens when youre on POT? she tweeted.Reacting to the pot jibe, chief minister Siddaramaiah said he is not aware of the tweet, but character assassination of any individual was not right.I have countered Modis allegations point-by-point against our government, but refrained from making any personal attack. He may be our political rival, but I will not speak disrespectfully of the PM personally. We are in a federal structure. We have accepted the Constitution. We have to run the government in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. We cant go against it. We are not the BJP to go against the Constitution, he said.Hitting out at Ramya, BJPs IT cell head Amit Malviya tweeted: In Karnataka, more than 3,500 farmers have committed suicide under @ siddaramaiahs watch, highest for any state in India but speaking for them is being on POT...Congress keeps it classy, again...And in another tweet: Will Rahul Gandhi maintain silence on Divya Spandanas comment while he sacked Mani Shankar Aiyar just because his jibe came close to Gujarat election and Karnataka is still some months away? Or sacrificing his close aide, responsible for his rise as a leader, takes some courage?To this Ramya replied: Single Meaning plz ! Share it with those who have understood.

The PM on Sunday said in an address in the state that farmers are his ""TOP"" priority, and explained that by ""TOP"", he meant ""tomato, onion and potato"".Ergo, the Karnataka Congress today tweeted asking him questions on unemployment, using similar acronyms and giving new expansions to existing ones.""Mr. Modi, isn't your TOP priority to create Jobs?

The Congress suspended Aiyar from the party for using the word ""neech"" in a comment aimed at PM Modi during the Gujarat Assembly polls.Spandana then wondered - a mite disingenuously - what all the fuss was about, saying ""POT"" merely meant ""Potato, Onion, Tomato"".""Come on!

Farmers of some crops have sustained losses, and there was little that the government could do as it was difficult to have a regulatory policy for each and every crop, said the APMC.Vegetable supplies at the APMC wholesale market this winter has doubled. The daily supply is pegged at 70-80 tonnes comprising some 600 vehicles  a mix of trucks and tempos. The crop has been better in the last two years, said Shivaji Pahinkar, APMC Mumbai secretary. The APMC comes under the agriculture and marketing department of the state government. Farmers growing tomato, brinjal and leafy vegetables are reported to have sustained losses, said the APMC. The loss is also on account of flooding of the market with farm produce from neigbouring states and farmers having to sell the stock cheap in view of increased supplies.Broccoli is largely supplied from Karnataka, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. Wholesale prices have plummeted while retailers have pocketed the benefit. Pahinkar added, There is very little that the government can do to contain the crash while there is no mechanism to control the retail trade. This year, the overall crop production has been good in the country. Pahinkar reasoned that it was difficult for the government to intervene into each and every crop, and so the government could do little to contain the fall in price, but if there was a concerted step by all state governments then the supplies could be regulated. A micro level planning will also be required as in what to sow and when besides more food processing units to match demand and supply, he said."

There has been a delay in price drop this year because of the unseasonal rains in November-December 2017. The rains had damaged vegetables in the fields and it took some time for the supplies to normalize, he said.However, the predicted spell of unseasonal rain, hail and thunderstorm is a cause for worry. Khaire said after such weather events, the vegetable prices tend to go up because of damage to standing crops.Even Arundhati Sharma, a housewife, does not expect the low prices to continue.

This Valentines Day , we share the tales of togetherness from six such couples for whom neither the colour of their passports nor the flavour of their cuisine mattered as much as that overpowering, magical emotion called love.Over the years, many a foreign tourist has visited Vijay Kumars tattoo studio at Fort Kochi. But when Natalia from Russia walked in, on a lovely January evening last year, it was a never-before moment. She took away Vijay Kumar's heart and their love blossomed into marriage in November, last year!He describes that first meeting: Natalia visited my studio out of curiosity, not to get a tattoo done. But when we met, something magical happened. Her simplicity and soft-spoken nature struck me.For Natalia, who was working as a manager of a company in Russia, it was her first trip to India. I remember the day I met my husband, vividly. I was at the hotel near his studio for dinner. Seeing the sign board of the studio, I went in, and there he was, she says. The gentle, open minded and kind-hearted Vijay Kumar won her heart in no time. He also has a subtle sense of humour, which I liked very much, she fondly recalls.Natalia returned to Russia by January end, but the duo kept in touch. We used to call and text every day, during breaks and after her office time. I realised how she was perfect for me. I am a simple Fort Kochi man, not someone who leads an adipoli life full of alcohol and cigarettes. Natalia shares my views and understands me. When she said she was ready to marry me and settle down here, I knew it was truly special, Vijay Kumar says.Natalia came back again in July. In September, they registered their marriage and had the wedding ceremony in November. She makes great dosa, idly, tomato rice and other Indian dishes, he compliments Natalia. She adds, Its his mother who taught me to cook them. But I am yet to learn complicated dishes. A vegetarian, she names chilly gobi, chilly paneer and dal as her favourite foods.Does she miss Russia? Well, when I do, I can probably ask my husband to take me to Munnar, Natalia says. I am in touch with my family through internet and have asked them to make their next trip to Kerala. Once we save some money, Vijay and I would make our first trip to Russia together.Music composer Rahul Raj says it was love at first sight when he met Miriam Merkle from Germany for the first time. She had flown down to Kerala to study at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeethams Amritapuri campus in Kollam. It was her great love for Indian culture that made her take up this course. Rahul was a routine visitor at Amritapuri campus as part of his music assignments and he had seen her there once.She was my Orkut friend at that time and I was surprised when she sent a message  Rahul Chettaa, I have heard your compositions and they are very nice, says Rahul. Thus we became friends and fell in love later. We got married in May 2008, after five months of knowing each other. My mother was a little worried that I was marrying a western girl; she was doubtful if my non-Indian wife would be able to adopt our culture and systems. But they are now more like mother and daughter and Miriam is very fluent in Malayalam. She was very keen to understand our rituals including pujas that we perform at our houses. She is a homemaker but for me, she is a wonder woman who takes care of everything at home including my mothers health. Our daughter Akshainie Leiyas name is a blend of German and Indian cultures. For us, Valentines Day is another ordinary day. We love enjoying the ordinary days and celebrate our ordinary life which is the happiest thing for Miriam and me.Irina Antonova, 30, first connected with Paul Skaria on a social media platform in November 2010. They chatted generally on travelling, personal development and Russian history in which Paul took a lot of interest. They later lost touch and did not speak for years but the connection was reignited after Irina posted a photo from London in November 2013. Paul was working in that city then and they spent several days together and developed a strong bonding.In 2015, Paul invited her to his home in India where he introduced her to his parents and proposed to her. In July 2015, they registered their marriage in Kochi.Says Irina: I remember that day vividly because it was an unforgettable experience not only because I was the bride but also because I was getting married in another country. It was in a beautiful church not far from our home. Some traditions and customs were new but there were no major differences because we both belong to the Orthodox church. I was dressed in a white wedding gown which I brought from Moscow while Paul wore a black suit. Later, I changed to a sari and I felt like an oriental princess.The couple are now settled in Kochi. She adds: We communicate in English, so there is no language barrier between us. Of course, there are some differences but it is natural. Ive learned to respect other peoples views and opinions more and to understand the values of another culture, to think in new ways and to take new decisions. Ive started to understand myself and others better. Along with exploring a new culture I understood my own culture deeper.She remembers that on their first Valentines Day after marriage, Paul gifted her some awesome jewellery and she gave him a palette with their photos. But we have 365 days in a year when everyone gets a chance to say I love you to their beloved and family members.""Avithal Elias Lautman describes her love story as a very nerdy one. She jokes that all her life, she prayed for a chance to study in IIT but God laughed and sent her to an IIT outside India. So, it was when both she and Ronen Shmuel Lautman were students of the Israel Institute of Technology that they met at a Diwali party organised by Avithal, a jew from Kochi. He loved my channa masala and we kept bumping into each other since then. He even came for my thesis defence. He was always too shy to ask me out, even though it was obvious he liked me, she says.Before one New Year's Eve, Avithal mustered the courage to ask him out, encouraged by her best friend Sara. Luckily, he didn't have any plans. We went out for our first date on New Years Eve, and we talked the whole night. It was very romantic. I couldnt wait to see him again. We made plans to have dinner the next night, and the rest is history. They got married on October 5, 2015, and are settled in Haifa, Israel.She continues: We embraced each others cultural differences, including food and family traditions. It was easy for us as we wanted more or less the same things from life and shared ideas about money, food, lifestyle and religion. Our parents were more excited and welcoming than we thought. His family never ever made me feel uncomfortable because of who I was. And my mom was always understanding with Ronens PDA. Also we never made fun of each others culture, but we did fight over the space agencies. Also he started eating with hands and learning Malayalam. I have already taught him to say, ente bharya sundariya. And he taught me how to eat with chopsticks. We love each more because of the cultural differences.She adds: On Valentines Day, we usually avoid restaurants as it can get crowded. We do make special food that day. It is usually only the two of us and that might include walks on beaches and a really good dinner.We do tell every now and then how we appreciate each other for being there always and we do not wait for a special day to say I love you.They met first in Dhaka where Ganga Nimmy Jose Cheripuram was associated with a bank and looking for a renewable energy project for rural India through micro finance and Johannes Fischbeck was a manager in a German firm that provided energy solutions to the developing world.My first impression of Joe was not so romantic as he was very reserved. If somebody would have told me then that he would be the man I was going to marry, I would have ran away at that moment itself, says Ganga. He, however, was impressed with her socialising.The long car rides in the next three weeks changed the equations drastically. We talked about our personal lives and realised that though representing vastly different cultures, we had a lot of common views. Still, it was the shock of my life, when he, after a week, confessed me that he liked me. I turned him down but one more week later, I found myself liking him too.Soon it was time to part ways. Joe went to Tanzania for another project while Ganga returned to Kerala. Mails and skype followed, not all of it official.Three months later, they decided to get married. For Joe, it was a bit strange to marry a girl whom he knew for such a short period but getting married was the only way to be together. Luckily, it was not so difficult to convince my family, says Ganga.Six months after their first meeting, Joe came down to Kochi with his parents and best friend. The Germans were astonished to see the 500-strong crowd while the Indians thought it to be a modest wedding. Joe still complains about the 300 photographs for which he was forced to smile.Ganga joined him in Berlin and found that language was a major barrier. There were other barriers too. We are so different. Introvert to extrovert, writer to talker, reader to cook, musician to gardener, cycling to watching movies...We never share any hobbies. But then, we really compliment each other. We do all our holidays to household works together.Daughter Emma was born in India and they stayed on in Kochi. So Joe started working as a renewable energy consultant in Kochi and I started a small business that deals with landscaping and terrariums. We enjoyed every moment of our six years in Kochi with lots of fun and fellowship.She adds: When it is time for Emma to start schooling, we came back to Germany and settled here now. In Joe's words, I am living physically here and mentally in Kerala. I continue my business in Kochi and am very well updated on all happenings in Kerala."

The immediate fallout of the strike was felt in the retail vegetable markets of the capital where veggie prices witnessed a rising trend. Moreover, the mandi board has incurred a loss of about Rs 2.5 lakh.Secretary of the traders association of fruits and vegetables Rajendra Saini termed the auction of parking lots as illegal and said nowhere in Madhya Pradesh farmers and traders pay for parking. The strike will continue till the mandi administration withdraws its orders, he said. He alleged that henchmen of contractors also extort money in the name of parking fees.As no farmer turned up in the mandi with his produce, the vegetable rates have started climbing in the retail markets. Besides, rates of fruits have also gone up. Saini said, Tomato, which was priced at Rs 10 a kg in retail before the strike is now being sold at many markets at Rs 20 per kg. Green chillies prices have gone up to Rs 50 to Rs 60 a kg. As far as fruits are concerned, papaya is being sold for Rs 30 a kg, almost Rs 10 up from yesterdays price.Achche Miyan, a retailer in New Market, said: Rates of fruits and vegetables in the city are likely to go up further if the mandi strike continues. There was already a shortage of commodities on Thursday.Joint director of mandi Ritu Chouhan urged the traders to end their agitation. She said she has directed mandi secretary Vinay Pateria to resolve the issue. However, the traders meeting with Chouhan on Thursday afternoon did not yield any result and the strike is likely to continue on Friday as well."

The administration, however, feels its not at crisis level because tomato is a multipleharvest crop.Mahendra Singh, the biggest tomato farmer in Kolaras of Shivpuri  one of the three districts that produce the crop  said: A crate carrying about 25-30kg of tomato is being sold for Rs 60 to Rs 75. This is too little. The cost of growing the crop is about Rs 3.5/kg per hectare of land, which is why farmers in Shivpuri, where the best quality tomatoes are produced, are incurring huge losses. Kolaras has assembly bypoll on February 24.Earlier,10,000-oddcrates of tomato used to be sent to Pakistan, said Singh. But the export has been stopped. Now we are sending only to Nepal, and that too only about 5% of what used to be sold in the past. The surplus tomato is now being sold at a throw away prices, he added.Another big tomato grower, B P Dhakad of Ratlam, told TOI, At the moment, tomato is being sold in Pakistan at Rs 100-150 because the Centre has stopped export. The shelf life of our tomato is 3 to 4 days and in this period the yield can be sent to Pakistan only, a country with huge consumption of the vegetable.There are reports from Khargone and Badwani of farmers destroying their yield in the farms itself. Things may worsen in other parts of the state, said Shivpuris Mahendra Singh Horticulture director Satyanand doesnt agree. Tomato is a multipleplucking crop and farmers sometime sell their yield at Rs 40 a kg. Had they been incurring losses, they would have stopped cultivating tomato, he said.About governments plan to establish food processing units to utilise the yield, he said, We are still hopeful. But it is a risky business. Investors are scared that farmers may shift to other crops. Food processing plants are yield specific. A plant installed for tomato cannot process any other vegetable."

Last month, the price of the vegetable was around Rs 30  35 per kg. Traders at the Gandhi market in the city stated that the fall in price was mainly owing to the increase in supply and lower demand.At a time when selling one bundle of cabbage itself is a big task and we are provided with two or three more bundles, it is only obvious that we have to decrease the price to sell them off, said R Loganathan , who works at a vegetable shop at Gandhi Market.Cabbages mostly come from Bengaluru and the supply has increased significantly over the last few weeks, he added. We dont sell the unsold cabbages the next day, so it is absolutely crucial that we reduce the price so that we dont incur losses, he added.Other reasons for the fall in prices of vegetables are the cultivation trends of farmers and increase in number of markets in the city, claim a few traders.M Thangamani, manager at V S Karuppaiah vegetable shop at Gandhi market, said that many farmers cultivate a particular crop which would be highly priced at that point of time. Take tomato for example, if the price of the vegetable is high, every farmer starts to cultivate it, which eventually results in bigger supply and lower price, he said.Several traders had also predicted that the price of cabbage would increase again in a couple of weeks. It is not the case only with cabbage  any vegetable which is sold at a steep price would have a drastic fall in the following month. Its a cycle, Loganathan said, adding, For instance, coriander, which was sold for only Rs 5-6 per kg last month, is now being sold at Rs 15-16 a kg."

When the price dropped to Rs. 3 a kilogram for tomato, farmers had left the crop unplucked. Some of them dumped heaps of ripe tomatoes by the road when they failed to get a price that would at least cover the labour cost.Kerala is the main market for the crop produced in the border villages. In the main vegetable market at Udumalpet in Tamil Nadu, farmers had to sell a 14-kg box of tomatoes for Rs. 20. The cost of plucking 14 kg alone is estimated at Rs. 10. Hence they find plucking the crop pointless.Rs. 20 in IdukkiThe same crop is charged Rs. 10 to 15 at the market at Marayur, in Idukki district, nearly 40 km from Udumalpet. In other areas of Idukki, the price is Rs. 20 or above.Market sources said tomato prices nosedived following a bumper production on the border villages, facilitated by the use of high quality seeds and a favourable climate there. They cultivated varieties such as 5005, US1, and US3. The demand for tomatoes in Kerala has not dwindled, but it is not high enough to absorb this added production. Last year, the price was almost 30% higher at the time of harvest.Boxes of tomatoes are left unsold at the Udumalpet market, which, along with Ottanchatram and Pollachi, is the main vegetable market near the border in Tamil Nadu. At Uralpatti, Edayamuthur, and Kannamanaickanur, tonnes of ripe tomatoes were found unplucked on the farms. The crop is mostly cultivated at Gudimangalam, Pethappampatti, Pollavadi, and Kurichikottai villages of Tirupur and Kumaralingam and Palani valleys of Tamil Nadu from October to January. In 45 days, it will yield fruit. In the cool-season vegetable producing villages of Kanthallur and Vattavada in Kerala, tomato is not cultivated now. It was cultivated earlier, but with poor availability of water and change in climatic conditions, farmers slowly shifted to other vegetables, said a farmer at Kanthallur."

Their own fields were their labs, as they put into practice what they gleaned from their textbooks.Some of the budding agriculturalists not only tweaked farming practices in their fields, but also helped transform their villages.In Kolar, farmers tend to grow lots of tomato. Between 2012 and 2014, we suffered losses and could not even meet the cost of cultivation, said Udaykumar K.S., who hails from Mallasandra in Kolar district, and earned an M.Sc. in agricultural economics.He convinced his parents to incorporate an integrated farming system. Now we grow potatoes, tomatoes, and cauliflower based on the season, and we are able to make a profit, he said.This prompted several other farmers in his village to follow their footsteps.

Two of my siblings are engineers. My father is proud that I have chosen this subject. As I come from a family of farmers, I got hands-on experience and observed the different practices adopted on our land, she said.It was not easy for all students to convince their families, steeped in age-old farming practices, to experiment.Yashika M.P. from Bellumadu, near Virajpet in Kodagu district, earned an M.Sc. in sericulture and bagged three gold medals. Over the past year, she has been trying to promote organic farming back home. It took a lot of convincing, as organic farming is a slow process. It will take another two years to see the results, but I am optimistic, she said.H.B.

Maybe this is because there are quite a few things that Ive refused to put in my mouth. Over the years its become a perverse fascination of mine to see what other people hate to eat. Perhaps this started when, as a kid, I developed a deep disgust for ghee  not a good aberration in a child with a Gujarati Vaishnav background. Well into adulthood I would recoil at any sight of ghee, whether it was being put in diyas for puja, spread on thin Gujju rotis or some mother/aunt-type culinary sergeant was attempting to sully my precious aamras with a drizzle of this melted hell-produce. My mom was unmoved and caustically pointed out the sheer idiocy of my attempting a ghee-mukt diet: You lovemagas(a typical Gujarati sweet) and it is full of ghee! Or: You love your Punjabi food and a lot of it is made with ghee! (A really sore point for her was not that I liked Punjabi vegetarian grub but that I ranked it on par with Gujju food.) My point was, as long as I couldnt see it, it was fine, but the visuals were intolerable, setting off a chain of retching in my throat.Food phobiasI was a weird kid. I hated ghee, rice andbaingan, but I lovedkarelaand the umami of vaal ni daal . Of my two sons, the older one decided at the advanced age of three to keep his fathers perversity but not for the same food. For the longest time I couldnt put any tomato-based product in front of him, namely, anything in which you could discern the offending red fruit. Would he eat pizza? Ye-es. Not as enthusiastically as other kids but he would eat it. Pasta sauce with tomato elements? Yes, as long as it was paste. Tomato salad? No way. Ketchup? No, wed have violence if there was any on the table.Then there is a friend of mine, S, a Gujju and a food lover from the same background as mine, for whom the kryptonite effect comes from just seeing coriander. Again, this is extreme cultural treason from a Gujju, but there it is. Forget about actual cilantro, we friends can torture him simply by posting photos of the green stuff on his Facebook page. How can a Gujju not love kothmir ? people ask him. S just smiles and says: But I love fish like a Bengali! At one point, S explained to me with the aid of a scientific website how the leaf actually sets off a semi-allergic reaction in him. Again, if he cant see it or smell it, hes fine. So no chopped coriander on his dhoklas, but if I use it as part of a paste in a daal hell eat it happily.Speaking of cultural traitors, people who know Im into food often ask me about the fact that I wont eat anything that has had any activity in water. People who dont know me well often ask: What kind of a Bengali doesnt love fish? My answer is simple: Im not a Bengali. I may have sloughed off my strict vegetarian upbringing, I may revel in eating all sorts of meat (yes, that kind and also that other kind), but this Pesciphobia is perhaps a remaining trace of my core childhood. Next question: How can you be a foodie and not explore seafood? A shifty Lefty once said: Im not a Marxist but Im a student of Marx. My reply goes: Im not a foodie but a spectator of foodie-ism. Which, of course, brings me to my Bong foodie friend who also doesnt much like fish. This friend, N, has even made a long documentary about Bengalis and fish, and he will lecture you knowledgeably about all the thousand varieties of fish available in the delta and how Bengalis of different persuasion (Ghoti or Bangal) like to cook them, but he will rarely touch the slippery suspects himself.Phobias shiftThe thing Ive noticed about these phobias is that they shift. Today, Son No. 1 is a reasonably good cook and he even uses tomatoes sometimes, though you can still get him to comply to demands by waving a bottle of ketchup. N is gradually beginning to include fish in his cooking repertoire, even though he himself barely eats it. Another friend, who used to find European cheese difficult to comprehend, is now, under direct pressure from a romantic and emotional direction, starting to discuss the joys of chvre, brie, pecorino and manchego. The other day, I found myself at a new restaurant trying and really liking some beautifully cooked crustaceans, lobsterish white pulp, glittering black eggs and all. Well before that, I discovered the joys of proper, naked ghee, the nice one my local milk-wala makes, the beautifully fragrant variety you get from Mysore, and even the superb organic one produced at a farm in Suffolk that costs 10 for a small jar. As N has demonstrated to me, decent ghee is central to a first course in Bong food, mixed with plain, hot rice plus some crisp, bitter element such as karela , thus creating a dtente between what Ive always loved and till recently hated. Does this mean I foresee S soon relishing a crown of coriander on a ceviche? No, that may take some time, but S has promised that the day a certain other pair of Gujaratis are forced to loosen their grip on power, he will eat something with a garnish of kothmir."

The price of vegetables in wholesale markets, and uzhavar santhai are fixed based on the arrival of stock and the prevailing demand.The price of vegetables has been coming down in the last few weeks.Normally, the prices go up during marriage season, and other festival days.The price of small onion has fallen from Rs. 180 a kg in December last to about Rs. 24 in uzhavar santhai on Monday.The price of tomato stood at Rs. 7 a kg; brinjal about Rs. 14; ladys finger Rs. 24; potato Rs. 20; snake gourd Rs. 10; broad beans Rs. 14; cluster beans Rs. 20; bitter gourd Rs. 16; green chilli Rs. 16; Bellary onion Rs. 27; cabbage Rs. 12; carrot Rs. 30; and radish Rs. 6.The price of coconuts, however, has gone up.Many consumers said that low price of vegetables will help those belonging to the weaker sections of society while conducting marriages.The farmers at Suramangalam uzhavar santhai said that the district experienced widespread rainfall by the end of last year, following which farmers had raised vegetables in a larger area. There was a spurt in vegetable production in the villages due to the availability of adequate water. The bulk arrival of all sorts of vegetables in the markets has brought down their price.The bulk arrival is expected to continue for a few more weeks, they said."

I can smell mustard oil and asafoetida, and know that some delicious Kashmiri dish is being cooked by our Kashmiri neighbours.Its a cuisine thats always been close to my heart. I like both Kashmiri Muslim and Hindu food, but I think I enjoy the latter even more than the former. The two kinds of regional food are similar  but also vastly different.I remember how thrilled I was when Chor Bizarre first opened up in Delhi in Asaf Ali Road eons ago. Since then, of course, several Kashmiri outlets  many of them catering units  have sprung up in the city. And Dilliwallahs are getting to know their gushtaba from their rista, and their nadru from their knol-knol.And, increasingly, we are discovering the differences between Pandit and Muslim food, too. What gives Kashmiri food its distinctive taste is the tempering in mustard oil of asafoetida and dried ginger, and the use of yoghurt and turmeric. Unlike the Muslim food, there is no garlic in the dishes.I had a great Kashmir Pandit meal some evenings ago at The Holiday Inn in Mayur Vihar. The coffee shop there  called Caf on 3  had a special Kashmiri food festival, organised by Rajni Jinsi, who I discovered is a great cook. The festival is over, but Jinsi runs her own outfit called Rajnis Kitchen (Ph Nos: 9899008238 and 9911469649).It was a stupendous meal  and I tried out many of the special dishes of the region, from kabargah (double-cooked lamb rack), fried fish, fried lotus stem patties to roganjosh, gosht yakhni and veth chaman, which is a dish of cottage cheese cooked with Kashmiri red chillies.What I really loved about the food was that they were all mildly spiced, yet each dish had its own characteristic taste.Contrary to popular belief, Kashmir food is not always rich. The moong dal that I had, for instance, was delightfully light and delicious. The dal had been cooked in some milk with pieces of radish, which added their own sharp taste to it.The yakhni, in yoghurt gravy, was smooth, and the Kashmiri chilli-red roganjosh was as pleasing to the eye, as to the palate. I use a lot of Kashmiri red chillies, for they add colour and a certain taste to a dish, but are not red hot. The KP roganjosh relies heavily on hing and does not use garlic, onions or tomatoes. Jinsis roganjosh was cooked with some yoghurt, dried ginger powder, fennel powder and some garam masala.I had thought I would stay away from the vegetables, but my young friend, Chef Suprabhath Roy Chowdhury (F&B director of the hotel), urged me to try out the schochal wangan  eggplant and Kashmiri haak  and I am happy he did. Tempered with dried ginger, some cloves and with the taste of tamarind in it, it was simply out of this world. What was equally delicious was the sweet rice  modur polav  which surprisingly really went well with the meat dishes.Another great aspect of Kashmiri food is the array of chutneys that come with it. There is a sharp radish chutney, a crunchy walnut one and fragrant one prepared with mint leaves.Rajnis Kitchen can cater for 15 people or so. I think she is one of the best cooks I have met in a while, and I hope the Kitchen does roaring business. Let the fires keep burning!"

With the commencement of the harvest period, the markets and godowns at Thammampatti have been receiving bulk stock of tomatoes daily.Due to the abundant availability of tomatoes, the price has nosedived for the past few weeks. The price has also gone down due to competition between people running the godowns.The price of tomatoes remained at Rs. 130 per bag containing 28 kg at Thammampatti. The price is Rs. 200 in Thalaivasal and Rs. 160 in the neighbouring Tiruchi district. As the farmers will be incurring additional expenses for transporting the harvested tomatoes to the markets and godowns, they have decided to convert the tomatoes into seeds for the next season.S. Mani, a farmer of Thammampatti, said that he spent Rs. 1,800 for the nursery for half acre land, after incurring heavy expenditure for ploughing the land, administering manure and removing the weeds.They have to pay Rs. 100 as wages for each worker for plucking 100 kg of tomatoes. They are not getting even the wages they pay to the workers from marketing the crop at present. As we will be incurring only additional expenditure by transporting the crop to the markets, we have decided to store them as seeds for next season.People involved in marketing tomato seedlings collect them in bulk from the farmers and market them to the needy farmers of other parts of the district. We are getting a little more revenue by marketing the seedlings then by selling the tomatoes, Mani says.The price of tomatoes has also fallen in the other production centres such as Mecheri and Muthunaikenpatti in the district.The price has been constantly remaining between Rs. 6 and Rs. 8 in the uzhavar santhais and other markets in the district."

MEP is the minimum price below which exporters cant export onions.The step would help in arresting crash in wholesale onion prices, which has a detrimental effect on the prices that farmers get from selling their product. The notification issued by the director general of foreign trade of Union ministry of commerce, Alok Vardhan Chaturvedi , said that MEP on all varieties of onions stands removed and can be exported without MEP.A copy of the notification is in possession of TOI. Experts said that removal of MEP is the first step towards tackling the volatility in onion prices.The Union government in its budget presented on Thursday had announced launching of Operation Greens scheme to address price fluctuations in onions, potato and tomato for benefit of farmers and consumers with budgetary allocation of Rs 500 crore for the scheme for the fiscal 2018-19.For two years since December 24, 2015 there was no MEP of on onions.However Centre re-imposed MEP on onions on November 23 last year at USD 850 per tonne. Thereafter on January 19, Centre had also reduced the MEP on onions to USD 700 per tonne.The sources from the ministry of agriculture said, During the recent meeting with the officials from the ministry of commerce, it had already been decided to remove the MEP on onions if the average wholesale onion prices dropped below Rs 2,000 per quintal. Now, the average wholesale onion prices have already dropped to Rs 1,500 per quintal. Hence, it had been immediately decided to remove the MEP of onions."

The Prime Minister likes to boast that it is much easier to do business in India now than it ever was.Indian farmers voted overwhelmingly for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2014 general election that swept him to power. He cannot count on them doing so again, as a crash in commodity prices and surging fuel costs stoke anger in the countryside.Four years ago, Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept Uttar Pradesh, Indias most populous state, winning 73 of 80 seats, as the rural poor  swayed by promises of higher crop prices  deserted the rival Congress party.Now, facing criticism for not improving living standards in the countryside, where 70 percent of Indias 1.3 billion people live, analysts and farm economists said Modi would find it hard to repeat the feat in a general election due by May 2019.While it is risky to predict election outcomes in India, where religion and caste remain important issues  not to mention the influence of fickle regional parties  interviews with some of the states millions of farmers suggest rural angst could cost the government dearly.No doubt, there was a wave for Modi in 2014, but farmers are disenchanted with him now, said sugar cane grower Uday Vir Singh, 53, plonking down on a wicker chair and smoking his hookah. Modi promised to double farmers income but our earning has halved because of his apathy and anti-farmer policies. Nearly half a dozen farmers sitting with Singh on a hand-woven rope cot, and many of others in Kairana  which elected a joint opposition candidate from a small regional party in a key by-election this week  accused Modi and the Uttar Pradesh administration, also run by the BJP, of failing to live up to their promises and overlooking the concerns of villagers.Modi is a very good salesman but we are not going to fall prey to his glib talk again, said 55-year-old Narendra Kalhande, who grows cane on his 2.5 acre farm. Farm Minister Radha Mohan Singh defended the governments record, citing initiatives on irrigation, crop insurance and electronic trading platforms for farmers to sell produce.For farmers, Prime Minister Modis 48 months have been much better than the Congresss rule of 48 years, Singh told Reuters, referring to the main opposition party that dominated Indian politics for most of the years since independence from British colonial rule in 1947.CRISIS IN COUNTRYSIDEHigher inflation and sluggish growth helped Modi trounce Congress, which had long counted the rural poor as its core constituency, in the 2014 election. Small farmers had been hit by rising living costs but benefited little from rising food prices because of the web of middlemen in Indias agricultural markets.Since then the economy has picked up, recording its quickest pace of expansion in nearly two years in the first three months of 2018, helped by higher growth in the farm sector. But lower food prices, weaker farm wages and modest crop procurement rates  the result of a shift in focus from the subsidies favoured by Congress to investment under the pro-business BJP  have hurt most of Indias 263 million farmers, who typically own less than 2 hectares of land.In the past year, Modis popularity has fallen by 12 percentage points among farmers, according to a Mood of the Nation survey published last week by the Lokniti, part of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), a research institute.Next years election would be fought on farmers issues, said Yogendra Yadav, a leading academic-turned-politician. Farmer organisations in some states began a 10-strike on Friday, in which they have said they will stop selling produce to protest a steep drop in the prices of an array of farm goods.Farm Minister Singh said his government had yet to hear from farm leaders but was ready to listen.COMMODITIES CRASHPrices of pulses, a key crop for Indian farmers, have fallen 25-30 percent below state-set support prices, as higher imports and bumper local crops bumped up supplies. While the government announces support prices for more than 20 crops each year to set a benchmark, state agencies actually buy only rice and wheat at the support level.Vegetable prices, especially onions, cabbage and tomatoes have fallen 25 percent from last year, largely because of the lack of refrigerated trucks that could take the perishables to the consuming big cities. Milk prices have also dived by more than 25 percent in the past year as a global glut has brought exports to a near halt.Farmers in Charkhi Dadri, three hours drive west of the capital New Delhi, recently dumped tomatoes onto the road in protest after buyers offered a quarter of a rupee per kilogram for a crop that costs at least 6 rupees ($0.09) a kg to produce.Jai Bhagwan, 54, borrowed 12,000 rupees to grow onions on a plot of about half acre in Jhajjar, an area otherwise famed for pottery. When his crop was ready, Jai Bhagwan could get only 1,200 rupees.I could not even recover my labour cost, said Jai Bhagwan, who was in New Delhi recently to participate in a farmers meet. Prakash Singh, also from Jhajjar, spent 6,000 rupees to grow green chilli, but the crop fetched him barely 200 rupees.Im in debt up to my eyeballs. But I cant sit idle, so Ill have to borrow more to grow something else, Singh said.Ashok Gulati, a farm economist who advised Indias last government, said there were three policy options to support farmers: building state buffer stocks to soak up excess supply, acting to boost exports or building capacity for processing farm commodities into end products such as milled, dehusked pulses or vegetable oils.Most of those measures would require long-term structural changes, however, and analysts predict in the run-up to the election Modi is likely to announce more populist, short-term fixes such as higher guaranteed prices for crops and farm loan waivers.Many farmers complained they are still reeling from disruptions caused by the launch of a new nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July 2017 and a ban on high denomination bank notes in November 2016. Blaming the shock move for exacerbating farmers financial woes, Gulati said: Expectations were high from the government, but the fact is that the plight of farmers is far worse now than what it was four years ago.Modis drive to purge black money from the economy by removing, at a stroke, 86 percent of the cash in circulation, made it difficult for farmers, who survive on cash, to buy inputs like seeds and receive payments for their crops.In Kairana, all 35 farmers Reuters spoke to agreed that abolishing 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes had made things worse.POWER SURGEFarmers in Uttar Pradesh, home to 220 million people, are also angry over a sharp rise in the pump price of diesel and a steep hike in electricity tariffs. Many farmers in the state use diesel to run tractors for ploughing and trolleys for moving their produce to wholesale markets. They depend on electricity to operate irrigation pumps.Diesel prices have shot up by more than 40 percent to record highs and electricity tariffs have surged by more 20 percent in the past two years, said Shri Pal, a farmer from Shamli.Villages account for most of Indias diesel consumption and thats why higher prices pinch farmers the most, but diesel in India is much more expensive than Bhutan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, said Hannan Mollah, a former lawmaker and a senior official of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).Kairana and Shamli lie in the sugar cane belt of Uttar Pradesh, the top sugar state of India, the worlds biggest producer after Brazil. Soaring global output has caused a collapse in sugar prices, leading to losses for mills who now owe nearly 23 billion rupees to cane growers.A BJP spokesman, G.V.L. Narasimha Rao, said the government has streamlined timely payments to cane growers. That has not been enough to satisfy farmers such as Ram Lakhan Singh, a cane grower from Shamli. Most sugar mills have not paid us a single rupee since December and the government has connived with them to deprive us of our rightful dues. Trust me, cane farmers will think twice before voting for the BJP.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

On Thursday, the government bit the bullet and seems poised to reap benefits for summoning the courage to stop incentivising a tiny section.The calculation is that the levy on capital gains on equity will, in part, provide the funds needed for Modicare, supposed to be the worlds largest public-funded health insurance scheme, an audacious initiative which should bury the political insinuation that Modis was a suit-boot ki sarkar.The charge had looked an exaggeration after the government managed to sell demonetisation as a wealth redistribution scheme, a tool which robbed the corrupt rich to pay the honest poor.The sheer optics of a Budget  which blends the imposition of capital gains tax with ambitious schemes of health insurance for the poor and paying farmers 50% over the cost of production along with benefits for women and senior citizens  should blunt whatever punch, if any, the Ambani-Adani taunt would have still packed.If the setback among Gujarat farmers warned government of rural unrest due to stagnation in agriculture, the Budget shows that the BJP leadership did not waste time imbibing the message.The plan to cushion producers and consumers of perishable crops like potatoes, onions and tomatoes against the vagaries of production should help deal with grouses that took away from the governments success in checking runaway inflation under the UPA and dulled the appeal of its welfare moves.Expansion of MSP cover to 24 crops covering 90% of arable land, extension of credit facility to animal husbandry and dairy farming and the plan to extend the benefit to share-croppers and lessees should calm a countryside thats displayed its annoyance with BJP yet again by going with Congress in the Rajasthan bypolls.The measures will amplify the message that Modi has sought to put across by providing free cooking gas connections to the poor, reaching electricity to thousands of unlit villages and constructing subsidised houses for the rural populace at a fast pace.Micro, small and medium enterprises have been celebrated as the new potential engine of growth, with benefits proposed to compensate them for the hit they took post-demonetisation and in the wake of GST rollout.Concern for job-creation that fits the conventional description was reflected in FMs incentives for labourintensive sectors of leather and textiles and the nudge to employers to formalise jobs.Sullenness among youth  another constituency, which like farmers, turned out in huge numbers for Modi in 2014  has emerged as a major worry. The government expects jobs to emerge from the thrust on infrastructure as well.Absence of tax relief for the middle class may not necessarily reflect a shift of affection away from Modi. It is sure to upset vocal categories, with the surprise decision to announce fixing salaries of MPs fuelling angst.But what looks like an ommision in a perfectly political budget may perhaps also be an indication that it may not be this governments last one before it faces the popular test."

""GST (goods and services tax) or no GST, Arun Jaitley 's proposals will not shake our household budget,"" says Vandana Kansal, homemaker and wife of private bank vice-president Sanjay Kansal The family, which lives in Sector 20 of Panchkula, says the budget is ""okay, okay"", neutral in terms of revenue and disappointing on the tax front. A reduction in the excise duty on petrol excise is a welcome step for it. ""Since most household items are now part of the GST system and this tax cannot be changed unless approved by the GST council , this year's budget was not so much about the prices of household items. The only upsetting this for the family budgets is not much tax relief for the salaried class,"" Vandana said.""The tax slabs should have been redefined as it has been a long back since the last big revision,"" said Sanjay Kansal. ""The slabs needed revision because rupee has depreciated. The salaried class gets standard deduction benefit of Rs 40000 but it will include medical allowance of Rs 15,000 and transport allowance of Rs 19,200. Effectively, this is very little benefit. With the cess increased from 3 to 4%, this class will actually end up paying more tax. With price rise unabated, practically we have less money in hand for savings and household expenditure.""The children of the family, however, are happy, as the budget lays emphasis on better opportunities for education and skill development. Engineering student Ritvik and Class-XI boy Kartikey are happy about cheaper footwear but sore about costlier mobiles and televisions.The budget has brought cheers to the family elders. Sanjay's mother, Santosh Kansal, said: ""As a senior citizen, I am happy for higher interest on my income up to Rs 50,000."" Being a bank officer, Sanjay's overall view on the budget was: ""Considering that it is sort of pre-poll budget and our farmers are in real distress, I'll call the proposals pro-farmer and pro-poor, even a watershed budget. The biggest provision is 'Modicare' on the lines of ' Obamacare ', where the poorest 10 crore families of 50 crore members will get annual medical care of up to Rs 5 lakh each in case of hospitalisation. It was needed. I like the provisions for farmers, be it Bamboo Mission or credit flow to agriculture and allied activities or mega food parks. Operation Green will help increase the production of potato, tomato, and onion, and save us from abnormal rise in the prices of these food items."""

The price quoted by the vendors on pavements was Rs 20 a kg in the late evening hours.Kailsah Tajni, the chairman of wholesale vegetable merchant association, APMC, told TOI, The price of tomatoes has come down to Rs 5-6 a kilo compared to Rs 6-7. But the kitchen staple sells at Rs 40 per unit at upmarket retail plazas, while the general price was Rs 20 a kg. Brinjal is sold at Rs 5 per kg in the wholesale market, but its prices jumped to Rs 30-60 a kg, depending upon the location. There has been a declining trend in wholesale prices of vegetables since the beginning of January due to an excellent winter crop, but the retailers had pocketed the benefit and unsuspecting customers were paying more. Retail rates of most vegetables remain high in Mumbai. Each year prices tend to drop after November 25 as winter sets in but this year rates did not fall until after December 15. On Friday, cauliflower is selling for Rs 60 per kg, brinjal Rs 80 and broccoli Rs 120, said Ayesha Bano, a resident of Four Bungalows, Andheri. Tomatoes are at Rs 16-22 and onions Rs 30.The Dadar Plaza Market is the main wholesale market of exotic vegetables. Trader Dharmendra Vaish said, Prices of most exotic vegetables including broccoli, zucchini and Chinese cabbage have dropped. In growing areas farmers are selling for Rs 7-8. The wholesale rate in Dadar is Rs 15-25 per kg. Retailers who factor in overhead costs and some profit can sell for Rs 35. If they are charging more than that it is profiteering.An experts said, the absence of space to sell directly produce had resulted in few markets and as a result the crash in wholesale prices had not been transferred to buyers."

The incident took place at about 11 pm.According to CTF officials, they received a tip-off saying that two smugglers were transporting ganja from Visakhapatnam Agency to Hyderabad. In an apparent attempt to evade the police, the accused travelling in an Innova car bearing registration number AP 05 BP 4992 refused to stop at the check-post and sped past. In the process, the car rammed a police vehicle. Soon, a high-speed chase ensued for the next three hours even as the car was driven rashly on the highway. Finally, the smugglers were intercepted at Kanuru village and they were taken into custody.While conducting checks, the CTF officials seized around 300 kg of ganja packed in polythene covers from the vehicle.About 300 kg ganja worth of 50 lakh was seized and we also impounded the car. We are interrogating the accused. Investigation is still on, said a senior CTF official.Meanwhile, sources said that the gang was involved in the illegal trade for some time and has been notorious in supplying ganja to Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.The police said the accused were also involved in circulation of counterfeit currency. A case was registered against them under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. The CTF have been delegated to crack down on ganja smuggling in the city. Vijayawada stands as a major transit point for the smuggling in the recent years, however cops said that consumption is much lesser in the city. Recently, even the directorate of revenue intelligence too caught a number of major cases in Enkepadu area and other places where they have seized tonnes of Ganja this year. This isnt the first time the CTF are chasing down ganja smugglers in a dramatic fashion, four months ago they did nab a speeding truck near Nandigama area where they seized more than 900 grams of produce hidden amongst tomatoes."

Some of our bestsellers were a variety of salad greens, including iceberg lettuce, arugula, cherry tomatoes and herbs like celery, coriander, basil, mint and thyme, etc. Vegetables and fruits like brinjals, green and red chillies, bell pepper, tomatoes and lemon plants were also in demand. Visitors took home a lot of vegetable and flower seedlings, which were priced between Rs 8 to Rs 10. Due to the persistent termite problem in most of Noida apartments, people were keen on buying termite-resistant planters made from pinewood and sheesham wood.""Air-purifying plants were the highlight of the showShe added, ""It is a wonderful experience to exhibit at such shows as it helps in understanding market trends. For instance, a lot of Noidawallahs have started going back to nature. A lot of people want to understand about different ways of developing an organic garden.

There may be exceptions but it holds true for Perumal Murugan, the Tamil writer, several of whose books have been translated into English. The latest being Poonachi or The story of a black goat (Context).We meet at The Parks Mist restaurant for lunch. Asking the staff to suggest South Indian cuisine, Murugan quickly settles for onion uttapam. I can never say no to onion uttapam; its my favourite, he says with a genial smile. Meanwhile, fresh watermelon juice is served providing a perfect start to our chat.With a collection of poems and short stories and now Poonachi , Murugan seems to have gotten over the controversy created over his book Madhorubhagan or One Part Woman . Referring to it, he observes, I do not hold any grudge or hard feelings. What I am very sorrowful about is that peoplewho did not read my book protested against it. That is what dismayed me. It must have been hard giving up writing? No, on the contrary, I got enough time to spend with my family, grow potted plants and devote time to academics, says Murugan with the help of an interpretor.For Murugan, writing has been a second nature since he was eight. There was a childrens programme on Trichy radio station in which poems written by kids were read out. I used to regularly contribute for that. I wrote everyday because I am introvert, retiring and shy by nature. I did not talk a lot, and always avoided crowds. So, writing poems and stories substituted social interaction. Believe it or not, I managed to fill up 30 notebooks, he recalls.Writing short stories commenced from Class IX. I was inspired after reading graphic tales in magazines which I could not afford but my aunt used to buy. Gradually, my teachers came to know and encouraged me to participate in local school contests. Thus set in motion was Murugans life long passion for chiselling words.Pursuing Ph.D., Murugans first novel Eru Veyyil (The Rising Heat) was published in 1991 which he wrote during his summer vacations. I was 25 then and wrote it staying with my mother in a thatched hut with no electricity. My mother would be busy with the livestock while I lost sense of time adhering to my own clock. I used to only sleep, eat and write, never going out. This got her worried with many suggesting that I had lost my mind. So before returning to Chennai, she made me wear a holy thread blessed by a pujari around the waist. Every time I returned home I had to show it to her, he jests. As a child he loved sitting on a village boulder scribbling in his notebooks. My neighbours would tell me that one day I will get stuck to the boulder and would have to be surgically separated from it.Having lost his father early, Murugan was very close to his mother. I was called a mamas boy even after I got married. In a certain sense I narrate my mothers story through Poonachi. Like the goat, she too was the seventh child who lost her mother at birth; was a loner with her father being rarely at home. Their filial bond is so strong that even today Murugan has kept his mothers cell phone and SIM card as a memory.So is Murugan like his mother, a staunch believer of God? In my early years I was, visiting Kali and Murugan temples regularly. Later, studying Marxism and Periyars works, I started questioning, with the intensity of worship coming down. Those days, I argued with my mother on several occasions. Over the years reading more on these issues, I have come to the conclusion that whether God exists or not is not important but what is pertinent is whether He is necessary or not. For those He is, they must believe in Him without being criticised. Espousing live and let live, his belief sounds fair. Continuing, he adds, I do like to spend time at some of my favourite temples and tend to embrace the spiritual component of religion.The staff brings in sizzling onion uttapam with different chutneys, the coconut and its mint and tomato flavoured versions. Trying each of them, Murugan, gestures his appreciation. The uttapam is crisp and well made and the chutneys delicious. Not averse to trying local cuisine, the writer generally prefers South Indian dishes. I relish idlis, ragi dosa made with palm sugar, rice and paruppu kuzhambu; dishes made of country chicken but staying in Korea for a writers residency I had local preparation for a month without any fuss. Hailing from a rural region, Murugan has a weakness for vegetables. I love bitter gourd, suraikai (bottle gourd), lady finger, podalangai (snake gourd), brinjal and peerkangai (ridge gourd). The joke at home is whenever I am sent to buy vegetables these are bound to figure. Murugan does miss some preparations of his native place like kachayam, made of rice flour and jaggery and soiyang, a steamed pulse based dish kneaded with palm sugar. With passage of time, people have stopped making them.Calling himself a reasonable cook, Murugan reveals that like writing, he embraced cooking very early in life. With my parents leaving early to work on fields, my brother and I used to prepare and eat breakfast and walk five kilometres to school. We simply learnt by observing mother and helping her. He counts arisi paruppa, milagai (black pepper) and herbal rasams as his best preparation. The ridge gourd subzi I whip up, is relished by my wife so much that on returning home after holidays she always asks me to make it.Murugans felicity with cooking comes across in some of his works too. Yes, it does, but not deliberately, only on demand of the narrative. For example, in Arthanari and Aalavayan , sequels to the One Part Woman , I talk about how to grow and prepare a local variety of egg plant as mother used to. In Poonachi, I write about rice gruel and how to make dry salted meat pieces for future use. Likewise, in Seasons of the Palm there is description of ragi porridge.Drawing parallelsHaving learnt to wield the pen and cooking spud since childhood, Murugan says one can draw a lot of parallels between the two arts. For cooking and writing, passion, perseverance and persistence are must. Also to excel in their craft, the cook and writer must get out of their comfort zone and try something new. And eventually, both food and a work of literature must satisfy people.Reflecting on the making of a writer, Murugan states, The command over language and the content selection comes with experience. The foundation of good writing is the ability to get past ones own value system because that is what holds us from absorbing a lot of things. A good writer has to suspend his own value system and assimilate experiences. Did this come to him naturally? No, in many of my early works, for example, my short story collection, Thiruchengodu , I was heavily biased. Later I got over them and started writing on issues considered taboo by society. Examples of these are Pee Kadaigal (tales about shit) and Kethavarthe Pesarae (I speak bad words).Talking about keeping aside biases, Murugan is remarkable for etching characters which are neither black nor white. I avoid creating one dimensional characters. I believe all humans are a mix of both. In Poonachi, the old lady who is very caring to the goat becomes selfish when it comes to her survival. In her early years, her love is pure and selfless while later when she faces financial crunch, her kindness becomes conditional but that does not make her an villain. That is the way humans are, he remarks as we wind up our interaction.What I am very sorrowful about is that people who did not read my book protested against it. That is what dismayed me"

It is used to establish the diversity between populations, authenticate a species and in timber forensics.The process of DNA isolation involves treating the tissue sample from a species in chemical solutions called buffers, which is put in a column (a small container) and processing them in a centrifuge, which isolates the DNA. Earlier, this process was done manually, which would take almost a day. Later, there were several commercial kits which simplified the DNA isolation process.But these kits worked well only for commercial crops such as rice, tomato or cotton. When it came to tree tissue samples, most of these commercial kits usually dont yield results as trees have certain chemical compounds called secondary metabolites, which tamper with the reactions, said Modhumita Dasgupta, a scientist at the department of plant biotechnology in IFGTB, who was part of a group of scientists which devised the kit. Dasgupta said they have introduced an extra buffer solution in the kit which would remove secondary metabolites from tree tissues, thus giving pure DNA samples.She added that they first devised the protocol for their own laboratory use. They had patented it in 2009. Last year, the institute registered the trademark ArborEasy. The ready-to-use kit was launched on January 24.Dasgupta said those kits which yielded results for tree tissue samples were expensive. It cost around Rs200 to Rs300 for one reaction. But we have brought it down to Rs95 per reaction, Dasgupta said. Also the kit gives a high amount of DNA compared to other commercial kits, she said.In one reaction, our kit yields the amount of DNA other commercial kits yield in two, she said. In case of difficult tissues, our kits yield DNA, when others give none, she added.The kit isolates DNA from tissue samples in just around 90 minutes, said Dasgupta. She added that the DNA isolated using the kit has very high purity and a longer shelf-life, Dasgupta said. The DNA isolated using the kit can be used for experiments. We have used it for sequencing sandalwood genome, she added.The institute is also planning to commercialize the innovation, officials said. DNA isolation kits have a huge market today. Almost every college has students who do projects which involve DNA isolation at some level, Dasgupta said.For the first time, the institute has been planning to market the product in e-commerce portals, said S Murugesan, scientist and group coordinator for research, IFGTB. We also have asked for a seed funding to set up a unit in the institute to produce the kits commercially, he said."

And this has started affecting their price in the retail market.Usually, during February and March, the supply of vegetables is stable as the air can hold moisture for a long time and it is suitable to store them for one to two days. In April, the supply starts dropping and two months later the prices soar by around 25% to 30%.Currently, the supply of cauliflower has been reduced from 336 bags (50kg each) to 325 bags. Similarly, tomato supply has come down to 1,300 crates from 1,500 crates in 10 days. The marginal reduction in supply has led to increase in prices. The tomatoes that now cost Rs 20 per kg in the retail market costed Rs 14 per kg 10 days ago.Mohan Salpe , secretary of agriculture produce market committee, said, Only a required amount of vegetables is being harvested by farmers every day. The supply is already coming down, the effects of which will be visible in next one week. Vegetables, being a perishable produce, gets easily spoiled during high temperature. Also, adequate care needs to be taken while transporting vegetables during summer. At the same time, the supply of some vegetables such as spinach increases these days as farmers cannot keep such produce in the farm for more days unlike brinjal (eggplant) or tomatoes.The vegetable supply in retail markets comes from the nearby rural parts of the district. The sugarcane farmers tend to cultivate vegetables as inter-crop in their farms after sugarcane is cut and sent to the mills. Such vegetables are available in abundant during January and February.However, now the supply of vegetables grown as intercrop starts declining and the retail markets depend on vegetables supplied from the distant places that makes it costly owing to the transportation cost."

They have formed a group and set up a sales outlet at Athappa Gounden Pudur near L&T Bypass in the city on Wednesday to sell their farm produce directly to people.This comes against the backdrop of the prices of perishable farm produce such as tomatoes touching a low in glut season, forcing farmers to go for distress sales or dump them as waste. Though in such times perishable produce are bought from farmers for very low prices, they are sold for prices several times higher in retail outlets. Farmers say this is because of middlemen commission and transport charges being added to the price.Farmers who started the outlet said direct sales will ensure a decent profit margin for them and also bring down the selling price as middlemen will be eliminated. They also said such outlets will connect local farmers with consumers, providing a sustainable business model for farmers.The district president of farmers association, A S Babu, said the major cost addition in farm produce was transport cost. If people travel to Coimbatore from Sulur to buy farm produce, the cost will be significantly higher, as the transport cost and labour cost will be added along with commission for middlemen. Farmers outlets will do away with such costs, Babu said.Babu said the price of onions sold by farmers had fallen by five times in the past two months. But big retailers sold the same onions for almost 1.5 to 2 times the price. If farmers sell it directly, the price would be much lesser, said Babu. He added that through their outlet they would also give their produce to wholesale sellers. State treasurer of farmers association C Thangaraj said such an outlet was new to the region. There have been such efforts in places such as Karur and Erode, he said. He added that they saw agriculture as a local market, so they sought to connect farmers and consumers from a locality."

Though a simple web search may throw up numerous solutions to such problems, theres nothing like getting it straight from the horses mouth.This is what the food processing business incubator at the Post Harvest Technology Centre of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) has been doing for almost 13 years. The centre was established in 2004 with the motive to reduce post-harvest losses by creating value added products from farm produce. A year later, it started offering training programmes.""Generally, during glut season, the price of a product drops drastically. In such times, farmers throw away perishable goods such as tomatoes. In order to reduce such wastage, we invite them and show them how they can produce value added products such as ketchup using tomatoes,"" says N Varadaraju, head of the centre.The incubator at the centre offers monthly training programmes in food processing under eight units  juices, jams, ketchup, masalas, pickles, bakery products, pasta and millet milling. ""The centre offers two-day training programmes for a fee of Rs1,500 on how to prepare the products according to Food Safety and Standards Authority of India specifications. Through our research, we have brought out standard recipes which we teach,"" says G Gurumeenakshi, associate professor at the centre.The centre also signs memorandums of understanding (MoU) with people who want to start their own food product ventures. Varadaraju says some of the participants of the monthly programmes would want to pursue it as a business. ""For a fee of Rs 10,000, we allow them to use the equipment at the centres master kitchen for one year. They can manufacture their products and also pack them at the centre. But they themselves have to take care of the marketing,"" he says. A total of 12 MoUs are signed every year, he adds.Through its bakery unit, the centre trains people to make millet-based value- added products such as bread and cookies. The bakery unit also makes other items such as cakes, buns and puffs, says P Vennila, professor at the centre, and in-charge of the bakery unit. It has a counter sales unit, where the products prepared by in-house staff are sold.Of the hundreds of people the centre has trained, around 30 have started their own ventures in Coimbatore and across the state and have been functioning successfully, said officials at the centre."

None of these promises have been kept. The BJP government ought to be termed a government that does not keep promises.He said, We have a similar experience with the Fadnavis government in Maharashtra too, and farmers are planning a march from Nasik to Mumbai, to gather outside the state assembly in protest. The farmers of Rajasthan have inspired movements in other parts of the country. The chief minister probably believes that by stopping farmers from arriving today, she has scuttled the movement. If the government goes back on its word, it will be faced with a bigger protest than Rajasthan, Dhawale said.Joint secretary of AIKS Vijoo Krishnan said, The CPI-M government in Kerala has offered pension of Rs1,100 to farmers above 60 years of age, over and above the pension available to old people. If the government of Kerala can do it, why cannot Rajasthan? The procurement price of grain in Kerala is higher by Rs800 per quintal than elsewhere. The government says it does not have money to waive farm loans. Vikram Kothari of Rotomac pens got loans of over Rs3,000 crore to import wheat. Wheat is not even produced in Singapore.

Theres also a new attraction this year  Tomatina (tomato-throwing festival)  and most of these celebrations are lined along the Beach Road. Around three tonnes of overripe tomatoes have been procured from the markets and farmers for the Tomatina festival, which is being held for the first time in Vizag.However, green NGOs have cautioned the denizens on wastage of thousands of litres of water during the Holi fest and have stressed on the need for water conservation.Though preparations and pujas for Holika Dahan (bonfire lit at night prior to Holi) were held on Thursday night, most of the programmes will be held on Friday including the Street Festival and Balam Pichkari.The street festival would start in the morning and continue till 11 pm. The main attractions are food and fashion bazaar, Tomatina, rain dance, camp fire, rock band and sky lanterns at RK Beach, opposite Hawa Mahal beside Gokul Park.

However, the recent fads of rain dance in big groups and such Holi parties on a grand scale is leading to a lot of water wastage, especially before summer, when almost always water shortages occur in the city. Environment conscious denizens should come up voluntarily to stop such mass-scale water wastage and focus on conservation of water through construction of rainwater harvesting pits.P Santosh from NGO Ken Foundation also requested the public to play Holi by using dry gulal and coloured powders instead of wasting several litres of water."

Potato crop is also likely to remain down to stagnant this sowing season, horticulture departments senior official said.The official said, Heavy losses suffered by onion and tomato farmers in the past months has discouraged sowing.In June 2017, farmers staged protest in the entire state after onion prices slid to Rs 2 per kg. Tomato prices have also tumbled this season to Rs 5 per kg-Rs 8 per kg in the wholesale market on increased arrivals.Agriculture experts said, even the soil moisture remained less during the sowing period owing to less rains.Farmers shifted to chana as it gave better returns to farmers last season. Also chana requires less water making it the preferred choice of farmers when rains are not sufficient, said Kailash Agrawal , an agriculture expert.Chana and wheat are the leading winter sown crops of the region.Agriculture departments statistics stated that farmers have sown wheat on over 5.75 lakh hectare while chana was sown on 4.75 lakh hectare in Indore division.Horticulture department expects yield of potato to remain lower this season hitting output due to lower soil moisture.Mohan Pandey, a wholesaler of vegetables in Choithram market said, Prices of onions and tomatoes are unlikely to pick up from the current levels in near term as supplies from the old stocks and neighbouring states are sufficient to meet the demand."

The WPI data showed prices of pulses contracted an annual 24.3%, while those of vegetables rose 15.4% during the month, slower than the 36.7% rise in the previous month. Onion prices remained stubborn, increasing nearly 80% in February but lower than 127% in the previous month.Available trends suggest a pick-up in prices of some cereals, edible oils and milk was offset by a continued correction in prices of onions and tomatoes in the current month. Moreover, average crude oil prices so far in March 2018 remain lower than the trend for the previous month. However, an unfavourable base effect for crude petroleum and natural gas, and fuel and power is likely to push up the WPI inflation in March 2018. At present, we expect the average WPI inflation to rise to 3.9% in FY2019 from around 2.9% in FY2018, said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at credit rating agency ICRA.With both retail and wholesale inflation recording a decline in February 2018, the MPC is likely to keep the repo rate unchanged in the upcoming policy review in April 2018, she added."

In reply to an email, a PepsiCo India spokesperson said the variants will have 11% juice and will be sold in smaller serves of 250ml at an affordable price point.While sugary carbonated drinks attract GST of 40%, companies pay around 12% GST on juices, said an industry expert. PepsiCos new drinks are slated to fall into the latter category.The new range of locally relevant, fruit juice drink with fizz under brand Slice will be available as a pilot in select markets to start with, said the spokesperson. Rural and rest of urban (RoU) segments are currently 60% of the juice category and have been growing faster than metros. By riding on both company and franchise go-to-market sales and distribution infrastructure, we want to dial up growth and market access for our juice products in these key rural, RoU markets.Over the last few years, the Rs 14,000-crore carbonated soft drink industry in India has faced flak from consumers, who suddenly had a plethora of healthier options, such as dairy products or juices from local players to choose from.Akhil Gupta, MD of New Delhi-based Fresca Juices said, We introduced juices in all possible pack sizes, from 160ml and 300ml to one-litre and even two-litre economy packs. Starting with just one litchi flavour, Fresca has currently introduced new flavours, including orange mojito and tomato.Prices of carbonated drinks also witnessed an upward trend with the government increasing sin tax. To add to the woes of biggies, small regional players cropped up, launching 250ml PET bottles at Rs 10, which often mimicked variants from the larger players.

J Saravanan is one of the very few who dared to abandon his profession as a goldsmith to become a parotta master and subsequently launch the super-hit food joint, Sri Mahesh Tiffin Centre.Known especially for its egg-less kaima parotta, laba parotta and veechu parotta, Saravanans eatery, which opened seven years ago at Bajanaikuda Street in Palakarai , has people swarming every night to taste the delicious food items. Passion for cooking was something I picked up while I was learning to become a goldsmith in Sri Lanka, says Saravanan. In the mornings, I used to get trained to open a jewellery workshop while at nights I found time to learn to prepare parottas, he said.After staying in Sri Lanka for close to eight years, Saravanan moved back to India in the mid-nineties and was working as a goldsmith for about four years. I soon realised that it was not something I wanted to keep doing and hence took up the job of a parotta master at an eatery and worked there for about nine years, the 47-year-old recalled. On gaining confidence to start an eatery, he didnt think twice before plunging into the food business. Right from the first day, the response has been really good and close to 200 customers visit my place every day now, he said.Open from 6.45 pm to 12 am, kaima parotta, laba parotta and veechu parotta  which are available for Rs 50, Rs 40 and Rs 15 per plate respectively -- get over in an hours time thanks to the huge demand. I dont use egg in any of these varieties and for kaima parotta especially. Unlike other eateries, I also dont use ingredients like ajinomoto that are not good for digestion, he claimed. Since Im both the owner and parotta master, I dont dish out items in an unhealthy way to decrease the preparation cost, he said.The main ingredients of kaima parotta at his eatery are parottas, ginger garlic paste, coriander leaves and tomatoes. Apart from these parotta varieties, kuska, idli and idiyappam are also highly sought-after among the customers. When asked if he had any plans to expand his business in the future, Saravanan said, I get tempted to do so every once in a while. But many have had huge failures when they got too ambitious and expanded their eateries. Im just playing the waiting game for now, he stated.What: Egg-less kaima parotta, laba parotta and veechu parottaWhen: 6.45 pm to 12 amWhere: Bajanaikuda street, Palakarai"

He found the man haggling with an ambulance driver to get his dead childs body to the graveyard. Pasha saw the father send the body off and then head in his direction. He wanted to know if there was a canteen nearby where he could have a meal. The man hadnt eaten all day, he said, hoping to save the money for his childs treatment. It was that encounter that led to the initiative Doh Roti  started by Pasha and his friend Fayaz Ahmed about two months ago.Along with a group of volunteers and help from well-wishers, they make and distribute 400 meals (rice and dal) and 300 rotis to relatives of patients atHospital,Cancer Hospital and Al Bilal Diagnostic Center.The duo first began distributing meals to about 300 people every day near IGICH. Later, they met Mysurus Body Miyan Ayub Ahmed (who has been performing the last rites for unclaimed bodies, for the last twenty years in Mysuru), and Azhar Maqsudi (who feeds the hungry in Hyderabad in a similar initiative). With help and advice from them, Pasha and Ahmed scaled up and Doh Roti was started.(BM wrote about Ayub Ahmed on Feb 13, 2017 - Call him Body Miyan.)Pasha, who runs a hotel in, says: We took a room in Bilal Masjid to cook the food. Now we are a group of 25 volunteers. Every day, we cook between 10 am and 1 pm. After prayers, we begin the distribution. In the first round, relatives of patients at Jayadeva hospital and Al Bilal Diagnostic Center get the meals. Then, we go toand distribute there.The groups aim, he says, is to ensure that nobody sleeps hungry. Hunger has no religion, he adds.Arul Subramani, who runs an NGO for those infected with HIV, volunteers with this group.Weve been friends for a long time so it was easy to make this possible. We cook about 35 kg of rice every day. We also need about 12 kg of onion and tomato, 3 kg of other vegetables; this we usually get through contributions. A small food company here gives the 300 rotis. Each meal costs us Rs22, he explains.Sometimes, demand overshoots supply, and they have to replenish before heading for Kidwai, but its all taken care of.Ahmed, who co-founded the initiative, saysis a hospital hub. Patients come from various parts of the state and country for treatment and they stay on. While the government provides free food for patients, their caretakers have to fend for themselves. Not everybody can afford to eat out three meals. This is why we want to help, he explains.Luckily for them, theres plenty of help available. Their initiative has inspired others to open their hearts too. Ansar Khan, also a volunteer, tells how. I buy the vegetables from a shop in Madiwala. One day, the woman from whom I buy in bulk got curious and asked me why I needed so much every day and I explained to her our work. From then on, she has refused to take money for the vegetables, says Khan.Hundreds, if not thousands, of people have benefited from the teams dedicated efforts already.Anjanappa Nayka, whose son is being treated at Jayadeva Hospital, has come to the city from Raichur. I came here seven days ago. It is really hard to afford the food here; it is three times more expensive. A person at the hospital told me about the free food in the afternoon. It has been a relief; there are others like me too who have benefited from this, he said.The initiative is such a hit now that Ayub Ahmed has started it in Mysuru at.

Though the output has doubled in the last three months, the prices are yet to pick up. On Monday, the model price for the number one variety stood at Rs. 56 per 10 kg box, and the second at Rs. 30 per box.Though the stocks are reaching the Madanapalle market in several loads, the prices are not encouraging, say the farmers. From the last week of April, the produce showed signs of cracks due to intolerance to the abnormal heat. Mercury hardly crossed 35 degrees Celsius in the previous years in the area. For this reason, the first variety loads have dwindled, leaving the second variety to thrive, causing concern at trading.As the undamaged stocks are being sent to all over Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and other southern States, the domestic market has to depend on the loads with cracks and black spots.No cheer till JuneThe trade is unlikely to bring cheers to the farmers till May end or June first week, though it is projected that the stocks reaching the market would increase from the present 360 tonnes a day to more than 500 tonnes.Expecting profits, the farmers of Anantapur district, Chintamani, Rayalpadu and other border areas of Karnataka are also thronging the Madanapalle market. Despite the discouraging conditions, they have some consolation that the price is better than their domestic markets.Market Committee (Madanapalle) Chairman Ratakonda Gurappa Naidu said compared to the other markets in Rayalaseema or the southern States, the trade is not that disappointing. By the next two weeks, the heat might come down with seasonal showers or monsoons arrival. We are expecting bulk stocks from this month end. The situation is likely to improve soon, he said."

The Economic Survey points out that farm income may decline by more than 4% in a year. Heavy rainfall reduces income by 13.7% and 5.5% for kharif and rabi crops respectively.The budget provides for greater use of clean and renewable energy sources but does not deal with the management of climate change in relation to farming. It is important to set up climate risk management R&D centres at the block level. Such centres should be supported by trained climate risk managers. Climate change could become a mega catastrophe and there is need for immediate steps both in the areas of mitigation and adaptation The budget has provisions which can insulate farmers from distress sale and poor income . The finance minister has announced minimum support price (MSP) for all unannounced crops of kharif at one-and-a-half times of their production cost. If income is less than the support price, the government has said that it will make efforts to buy the surplus produce of the farmers.More allocation will be made for building warehouses and for upgrading 22,000 rural haats into grameen agricultural markets. The budget sets apart 2,000 crore for an agricultural market and infrastructure fund. Several steps have been proposed for promoting sustainable agriculture such as organic farming. Horticulture will be promoted with greater attention to the marketing of tomato, potato and onion and similar perishable commodities through operation greens with 500 crore allocation.Another welcome feature is to integrate attention to fisheries and animal husbandry with kissan credit cards.The national bamboo mission will be restructured in order to enhance the cultivation and consumption of bamboo products. The emphasis placed on self help group formation, cooperatives and other organisational methods which can provide the power of scale to the small scale producers is welcome.The priority given to rural infrastructure and irrigation will help impart stability of income and employment. Malnutrition is another serious problem and we need to promote symbiotic linkages among agriculture, nutrition and health.On the whole, the budget addresses some of the hotspots in the field of farming, the most important being the management of the monsoon and the market."

He has made a budgetary allocation of Rs 500 crore for the scheme.'Operation Greens shall aim at promoting Farmer Producers Organizations (FPOs), agri-logistics, processing facilities and professional management.The announcement of this scheme comes at a time when onion farmers of Nashik, the largest onion growing district in the country, are at the receiving end as they are not getting the right prices for their produce in the market.The scheme, insisted experts and farmers, will go a long way in preventing financial losses to onion growers following crash in wholesale onion prices that they often have to cope up with.According National Horticulture Research & Development Foundation (NHRDF) sources, the average production cost for growing onions is around Rs 900 per quintal and farmers incur losses if they get the price below that.But there have been several occasions in the past when the wholesale onion prices had crashed increasing the woes of the onion farmers of the district. And they had restored to agitations by organising protests like road roko demanding redressal of their grievances.Some onion farmers still recalled the huge crash of onion about two years back forcing 1.94 lakh onion farmers of the district to sell around 28 lakh quintals of onions at Rs 300-400 per quintal in just two months in 2016. They incurred financial losses of Rs 150 cr during that time.A major onion grower of the district Nivrutti Nyaharkar said that for long the onion farmers of Nashik have been demanding a scheme like Operation Greens to tackle the problem of onion price volatility."

The miseries of financially distressed farmers seem far from over even as they continue to demand waiver of farm loans and remunerative prices for their produce through several platforms across the country.The problem of plenty has hit the farmers badly. While garlic farmers in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, which produce 45% of the countrys garlic, recently fetched as low as Rs. 1 a kg in wholesale prices, the instances of tomato farmers dumping their harvest on the fields earlier this month  be it in Haryana, Tamil Nadu or Uttar Pradesh after prices nosedived  have only highlighted their woes. Tomato production during 2017-18, according to the first advance estimate, is likely to be 7.8% higher than that of the previous year. However, it is 20% higher than the average production of the past five years. Similarly, potato production is estimated to be 1.5% higher than that of the previous year. However, compared with the average production of the past five years, it is 8.7% higher. These figures indicate that farmers are producing more without good returns. Why are vegetable farmers not getting a fair price? Season after season, farmers face price uncertainties mainly owing to fluctuations in demand and supply caused by bumper or poor production, speculation and hoarding by traders.Are traders manipulating prices?In Madhya Pradesh, after garlic prices dropped sharply, the government decided to include it in the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (Price Deficit Payment Scheme) that was introduced in the Kharif 2017 season. Farmers, however, rue that with the conditions associated with the scheme, most of them are unable to gain any benefit. The scheme is aimed at providing price deficit payments to farmers if the market prices are below the minimum support price. Farmer leaders believe the implementation of this scheme in the first season has resulted in little benefit to farmers, with very little to prevent manipulation of prices by traders. The government claims to have disbursed Rs. 1,900 crore in compensation, but a large section of farmers has been excluded from the scheme, says Jai Kisan Andolan national convener Avik Saha. Those left out bore the brunt of a larger price crash because of market manipulation.What is the way forward?The fluctuation in vegetable prices has become a perennial problem and is usually associated with the economics of demand and supply. Farmers, mainly marginal and small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. Being perishable, vegetables are more prone to price fluctuation, hence they require better infrastructure for storage and marketing. Contract farming is an alternative for farmers to reduce financial risks by providing an assured market for their produce at a pre-agreed price. The Centre last week approved the State/UT Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2018. The Act lays stress on protecting the interests of farmers, considering them as weaker of the two parties entering into a contract. The Act is aimed at ensuring the purchase of the entire pre-agreed quantity of one or more of produce, livestock or its product. Although varied forms of contract farming exist in some pockets, a formal system is not widespread. By and large, cultivation of commercial crops such as cotton, sugarcane, tobacco, tea, coffee, rubber and dairy has had some elements of informal contract farming.Experts believe that integration of vegetable and fruit growers with agro-processing units through contract farming could prove beneficial to producers as it takes care of price fluctuations and helps to mitigate production risk. Pratap Singh Birthal, professor at the National Institute of Agricultural Economics and Policy Research, says: Under the contract farming law, the agreements would help farmers get an assured price for the produce, which will act as a buffer against price volatility and market fluctuations...Vikas Vasudeva"

While more than 100 farmers outfits participated in the strike, major organisations in the State like the Raju Shetti-led Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana refrained from actively participating in the protest.In Khed Shivapur, farmers condemned the apathy of the Devendra Fadnavis-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government by spilling thousands of litres of milk along Pune-Bengaluru highway.Similar scenes were witnessed near Sinnar-Shirdi highway in Nashik. Farmers demonstrated by spilling milk and demanding a complete loan waiver and immediate implementation of the recommendations put forward by the M.S. Swaminathan Committee on agrarian reform. According to reports, the police detained three protesters in Saikheda in Nashik.At Khamkheda village in the districts Deola tehsil, tomato farmers protested by throwing their produce on the roads.

But, given the trail of films made by RGV in recent years, somewhere midway through Officer the thought that cropped up is, at least this one is not an assault on the senses, so far rather than being wowed by whats being shown on screen.Officer has an interesting story, which the filmmaker reveals is based on real incidents. Hyderabad-based cop Sivaji Rao (Nagarjuna) is asked to head a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe into the ways of Narayan Passary, a cop credited with finishing off the Mumbai underworld, but who has now fallen from grace. Its an insider perspective of the police force and its dark corners. Can a cop himself build another underworld company to avenge his contemporaries? Throw in a few personal relationships and you get the necessary emotional heft.It sounds good as an idea but on screen, there are uninteresting stretches. It feels like were watching it from a distance without ever being invested in the proceedings. RGV has explored the crime-underworld-cops tropes before and excelled in his initial years, but this one doesnt have the zing. Several moves are over-explained and theres no surprise. In that scene where Passary is swiftly cornered and arrested, its doesnt take long to guess that the tables will eventually turn. There isnt enough backstory to these cops who are at loggerheads  one keeps harping that he did everything for the system and that he likes to torture people before they die; the other is just squeaky clean. The occasional underworld characters are caricature-like rather than fearsome. One of them plays a double-edged game but that too isnt explored well.The only reason to keep watching is Nagarjuna, who tries his best to hold things together. For all his display of agility and professionalism as an SIT officer, one only wishes for a better script. Myra Sareen and child actor Kaavya dont make a strong impression. And, it looked like the child actor was asked to display exaggerated emotions than being natural.RGVs fascination for unusual camera angles continues, thankfully they arent nausea-inducing. Several empty glasses are in focus  see a room through a glass, listen to a conversation through several glasses theres a scene where Nagarjuna is on a video chat with his parents who are seated at the dining table lined with two rows of empty glasses and an oddly-placed tomato. I dont remember the conversation because the focus was more on the glasses and the tomato.Officer also gets voyeuristic where it shows a close shot of the villain with pliers in his hand, threatening to splice off a childs fingers. The camera turns away but we know hes done it, because of the atmospherics. What were they thinking depicting such a sequence?The best part is, it all gets over in a little more than two hours."

Many are also selling them within the villages, said Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU). Today is only the first day, so urban markets are still able to sell what was supplied earlier. Wait and see; by day after tomorrow, prices will shoot up in cities.Ramandeep Sangh Mann, a farmer leader associated with the KEM  an umbrella body of 62 farmer groups  said, According to local reports, 40% of milk supply in Punjab is affected.Extending support to the farmers campaign, Punjab Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu visited Patto village in Fatehgarh Sahib and purchased milk and vegetables directly from a farmer.In Haryana, arrival of farm produce at urban centres was down by 70 to 80%, BKU leader Rakesh Bains told The Hindu .Mr. Bains said implementing the Swaminathan Commissions recommendation on Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops, complete farm loan waiver and fixation of minimum income for farmers are the key demands that the government should address immediately.We also want the government to fix MSP for milk and vegetables, he added.Supplies hit in RajasthanAlthough the agitation did not affect normal life in Rajasthan, supply of milk, vegetables and other farm produce was hit in Sriganganagar, Hanumangarh and Jhunjhunu districts.We will continue this for the next 10 days and the protest will intensify, said Santveer Singh, a member of the core committee of RKMM in Rajasthan. He said protests were held in Bikaner, Sikar and Nagaur.As the strike began, police in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh have kept a close vigil as the anniversary of the June 6 farmers agitation approaches. Six farmers were killed in police firing during protests last year.In adjacent Neemuch, again there has been not shortage of vegetables and milk although the markets were shut there.

Traders are reporting no shortages. Yet vegetable prices are at the upper end of the normal spectrum as retailers cite spoilage due to summer heat.APMC's former director and wholesale trader Shankar Pingale said, ""The average number of 550 trucks arrived Saturday. The market is closed on Sunday so we will assess the impact on Monday morning. But our farmers are continuing to dispatch produce because they have cultivated a good crop, so we do not expect any shortage or price increase for Mumbaikars.""Most vegetables are selling for Rs 60-80 per kg in retail markets of Khar, Andheri, Chembur, Bhandup, Malad and Borivli.Santosh Kesarwani, a greengrocer at Ahimsa Road, Khar, said, ""The only visible increase has come in tomato which has risen to Rs 25-35 from Rs 16-20 earlier. Spoilage is rampant during summertime and this causes farmers and vendors to charge more. A 25-kg box is being quoted for Rs 800 instead of Rs 400. Also, vegetables grown within Maharashtra are cheaper than those which come from other states. Most of Mumbai's tomato supply arrives from farmlands in Karnataka and transporters are charging more to cover the distance because of the strike.""On Sunday, tomato sold for Rs 40 per kg in certain shops of Chembur and Matunga but remained an average of Rs 25 in parts of Andheri and Bhandup.Cauliflower, lady finger, cluster beans (gavar) all sold for Rs 80 per kg in Andheri East, Khar, Chembur and Bandra East. The typical variation across localities was apparent in the quality and cost of produce.Meanwhile the cost of fruit, especially watermelon has risen owing to the seasonal spike witnessed during the holy fast of Ramzan. A single fruit averaging 2.5 kg sells for Rs 65-70 at Rs 25 per kg. However, alphonso mangoes are available abundant and cheap at Rs 250-350 per dozen as the king of fruit has flooded the market. Lychees have made a grand entry at Rs 60-70 per dozen which should settle to Rs 40 as the days wear on.Milk prices are stable. Cattlesheds in Goregaon and Jogeshwari are unaffected by the milk farmers' agitation. ""We hiked rates of loose milk before Ramzan and are now selling both cow and buffalo milk for Rs 70 per litre,"" said an attendant of Ghaswalla dairy in Jogeshwari. ""The strike does not impact us.""National dairies are doing their best to cope. The spokesperson of Mother Dairy Fruit & Vegetable said, ""We are keeping a close watch on the situation. However, we have made adequate arrangements at our end to ensure (proper) sourcing as well as supplies to the market."

Today, we have received very less quantity of vegetables from Punjab side and are not primarily dependent upon the produce from Himchal Pradesh and down South, he said.Krishan Kant, a wholesaler in Sector 26 grain market said, There has been a fluctuation in prices from past one week, but after the strike the prices of tomatoes and potatoes have shot up as these produces come from Punjab. We fear that there will be short supply of vegetables from Panjab side and if the situation remains the same, the city will face an acute shortage of vegetables.

Into its third day on Sunday, Kisan Avkash has already witnessed farmers dumping vegetables and milk on streets to hit supplies to urban centres and lead to a rise in prices.Right now, we are clearing the stock we had, but if trucks dont arrive tomorrow as well, prices will definitely go up, said a wholeseller of potatoes and onions. According to him, wholesale prices of both are currently Rs 600 per crate (50kg), making the retail price at around Rs 20 per kg. This will get worse in the coming days. Already, there was no auction of potatoes held today, he said.So far, price of potatoes and onions have not risen, but the price for tomato is already hit. That too, for tomatoes that are mostly damaged, as a result of a poor crop. Earlier, we used to buy a crate (25 kg) at Rs 30. Now, it has gone up to Rs 300, said a wholeseller for tomatoes. As a result, price of tomato has gone up as almost 100%.Vegetable associations said the price hike is not necessarily because of the strike. Most of the produce at Gurugram mandi doesnt come from parts where farmers are on strike. Potato prices could have increased because cold storages have started stocking up in anticipation.Till recently, vegetables were arriving in excess from areas around Gurugram.That has now fallen, with stock now coming from places further away, adding to transportation cost, said Inder Thakran , president of Gurugram Sabzi Mandi Association.At a retail store in Sikanderpur, retailers said the supply is still the same. The strike has had no impact here, as most of our vegetables come from nearby areas such as Pataudi, Rajasthan, etc, said the store manager at Haryana Kisan Mandi Zone Fresh near Bristol Chowk.However, sellers at the mandi said prices of some vegetables, like French beans, bell peppers and even mangoes, could rise if the strike continues. They added that rising prices could be profitable for them. We get less to sell, but can charge more in profits, said a seller, not wishing to be named.Mangoes have already seen a Rs 15-20 per kg rise, after the rate had dropped around two weeks ago.Authorities at the mandi said not much will change unless strikers start obstructing transport that brings in the vegetables to the city, or if the strike spreads to nearby areas.The recent hike is not because of the strike. Some vegetables cant be procured locally. Sellers here have to buy them from Azadpur mandi in Delhi, said Thakran, referring to bell peppers and French beans."

Since farmers have literally squeezed the supply of vegetables after the strike, it has become difficult for us to manage our lives, as our sales have dipped by almost 60%. We have to pay rent for vends, and have to earn our living as well, but it has suddenly become difficult to manage things, said Jyoti Devi, a retail vegetable vendor of Dandi Swami Road.The sudden hike in vegetable prices has caused problems to buyers as well. It is sad how farmers, vegetable vendors, as well as citizens are facing so many of problems due to the hike in vegetables prices. If vegetables also get expensive as other products in the market, then for a middle-class person, their whole budget gets disturbed, said Deepanjali Bhalla , a housewife.

With just two minutes remaining, hearts ticking faster than the stadium clock, Messi stood over a free kick. The Argentine faithful prayed for the divine to intervene. It seemed improbable from that distance or width. But it was a sort of moment when miracles happen, dreams come true.The hopes were dashed a moment later.Four years ago, it could have been Lionel Messis night of redemption, glory, fulfilment and maybe even peace. But 1-0 down against Germany, he failed to seize the day.There was a more earthly opportunity earlier, but Messi had rolled the ball wide.The fans wondered: Would he have scored if he was in a Barcelona jersey? The thought was irrelevant, but damning. For, Messi is condemned to bear the cross. He is Atlas Telamon, the enduring Atlas for whom the Golden Ball for Best Player was a burden because his best on the day was not good enough.It would be crossing many lines to place his predicament in such Biblical or mythical proportions. In fact, an Argentine football club recently recreated the Sistine Chapel on the ceiling of its gymnasium, with Diego Maradona as God and Lionel Messi as Adam, although the latters genius on field can sometimes make us forget his tortured soul.Barcelona may have his heart but Argentina has his soul. You read in a Guardian blog that his accent remains Rosarino, his favourite actor is Ricardo Darin and his favourite food is his mothers milanesas with tomato and cheese.Messis wedding last year in his hometown may not have been as simple as his tastes, so do his tax records, but give him a football and the real meaning of jogo bonito comes alive.Possibly there is Cristiano Ronaldo pushing him to the edge and beyond, the sound of broken records and numbing numbers. The endless stats, comparisons, full-page analysis are there for people to gobble, but there is something intangible. A rose doesnt compete with another rose, it simply blooms. There is simplicity, honesty, flavour, joy, intuition, playfulness. It is as though time doesnt exist.And yet time is ticking, ticking away for Messi, all of 30 now.The agony was palpable when a crouched Leo, wallowing in despair, hand on head, chose to call it quits. Having been beaten by Chile in the 2016 Copa America Centenario final, Messis moist eyes conveyed his journey was in vain. He could almost taste the trophy before it was snatched away, before he sent the penalty into heaven. Feeling responsible, he walked away shedding his cloak as Argentinas deliverer. Maybe, he can get back to happiness now at his Nou Camp fortress, away from the scrutiny and remarkable blame. And even hatred (news of his statues being vandalized in Argentina is a common story).Yet, love brought him back. The arrival boards at Buenos Aires airport read: No te vayas Lio: Lio, dont go. Despite all the problems in the Argentine federation and the storm within, the outpouring of affection changed the script.The qualification for next months World Cup was purgation. Argentina, who played under three different coaches, were outside the four qualifying spots going into the final match in Ecuador. Jorge Sampaolis team talk was emotional: Messi does not owe the World Cup to Argentina, but football owes the World Cup to Messi.Argentina were struggling to breathe in the high altitude of Quito, falling behind after 37 seconds. But the heros bright attitude and genius changed everything. A hat-trick, completed by an exquisite dink over the goalkeeper, ensured the flight to Russia and escape from ignominy.Now, Messi with his van Gogh beard, stands in front of the jury again. Perhaps, its been a refreshing season at Barcelona, the early ouster from the Champions League a definite blessing for all those Argentines begging for their messiah to be wrapped up in cotton wool. Perhaps, the resurrection will be complete on July 15 at the Luzhniki Stadium and a new Easter Sunday will be celebrated.Or perhaps, he is just human, destined to fall again. He would have touched the stars anyway. The world, maybe, is not meant for one as beautiful as him.Lets celebrate the Man, or the Messiah. Because we are going to miss Messi when hes gone."

All the crops, which he had planted and nurtured with high hopes, were completely destroyed by wild boars.According to Sasidharan Nair, wild boars have been causing huge trouble to the farmers of Thalappattumala  Pullambara regions in the Vamanapuram block for over 18 months. Even after receiving frequent complaints from the farmers, the agriculture department and the forest department havent initiated steps to address their woes.Last February, out of four tonnes of spinach cultivated I got only one and half tonnes. The crops are being damaged by boars during night time. Though we have complained to the authorities, they havent taken any action yet. We are living in a country that gives much importance to animals than humans, said Sasidharan Nair.Another farmer in the region, Radhakrishnan, had grown Paddy in five hectares and could produce only less than 500kg as rest of the crops were destroyed by wild animals.Nellanadu and Thottumpuram wards are other rural areas where the wide boar menace was reported. Plantains, tapioca, colocasia, elephant yam, ginger, and turmeric are the major crops which were destroyed due to animal raids.Shanthakumar, a farmer from Nellanadu, said, The boars mostly attack tuber crops and vegetables including peas, bitter guards, tomatoes etc. Farmers like me used to take farmlands on lease, now we are in crisis, he said.According to the Pullambara panchayat president Azeena Beevi, the panchayat is planning to take on preventive measures to defend the crops from the raids, with the help of Krishi Bhavan. The existing solution with panchayat is BOREP, a pig repellent peptide which can be applied at farms.The solution offered by the panchayat is not sufficient to address the issue, feel the farmers. They demand solar fencing for their land.Thiruvananthapuram wildlife warden Shaji Kumar said, Many cases have been reported in the areas bordering forests regarding the killing of wild boars by the locals. It is a criminal offence and under wild life protection act we will file cases against the locals."

Traders here blame Pakistan governments blanket ban on import of vegetables and soybean from India.A cross-border trader and Federation of Karyana and Dry Fruit Commercial Association president Anil Mehra said, Exporters are left jobless. He said there was apparently no reason behind Pakistan refusing to import vegetables and soybean except that its government had bowed to the diktats of hardliners who did not want to have any relations with India. Not only are we suffering but even labourers and transporters are at loss, said Mehra.A vegetable exporter from Bathinda, Narinder Sharma said, We often talk to our importers in Pakistan, but they are also helpless. They are now buying vegetables at much higher prices than they used to while getting goods from India. He said tomatoes were being sold at around Rs 5 per kg in the wholesale markets in India. Had Pakistan been importing tomatoes, the domestic price would have been more than Rs 20 per kg in wholesale. The Indian government should also take retaliatory action so that Pakistani businessmen also feel the heat of their governments decision, he added.In 2016-17 financial year, the value of exports to Pakistan via Attari ICP was Rs 1,063 crore, which dropped to Rs 744 crore in 2017-18. I cannot comment on the reason for decline of exports to Pakistan through Attari ICP since it is an issue between two countries, commissioner of customs (preventive) Dipak Kumar Gupta told TOI.Giving details of the volume of trade, Attari ICP deputy commissioner Balwinder Singh said India had exported vegetables, cotton/yarn, high density polythene (HDPE), soybean and other items amounting to 2.51 lakh tonnen in 2016-17 in Pakistan while there was no trade of vegetables and soybean to the neighbouring country in 2017-18.Balwinder said overall, they had registered around 30% decline in total exports and around 76% decline in the movement of trucks. He said the Indian imports from Pakistan via ICP registered a minor increase in 2017-18 as compared to the previous year, which also raised the revenue in terms of customs duty. India earned Rs 430.95 crore in customs duty on imports from Pakistan via Attari ICP in 2017-18, up by 77.72% from Rs 242.49 crore in the previous year.In 2016-17, India had imported goods, including dry fruits, dry dates, cement, soda, glass, gypsum rock/powder, aluminium ore and limestone, valued at Rs 2,907 crore from Pakistan via Attari ICP. The value of imports rose by about 17% to Rs 3,403 crore in 2017-18. However, in 2017-18 there was a minor decline in imports of dry dates, soda, glass, and cement from Pakistan.Sources said Pakistan had deliberately banned import of Indian perishable goods to dent the Indian economy and cause resentment among the farming community. As expected, farmers suffered (due to ban). A lot of tomato growers had dumped their produce on roads and staged demonstrations last year. Tomato was otherwise exported to Pakistan via Attari, they said.The foundation stone of Indias first ICP at Attari was laid by former Union home minister P Chidambaram on February 20, 2010, and it was later inaugurated by him on April 13, 2012."

Devyani Pandey who has a Lhasa Apso says, ""I keep my dog inside my house and dont let it go outside even to the porch. In the morning, when I go running, I take it along and post-sunset we go to the park to play. I brush it regularly so that it feels light."" While this is the normal routine for most dog owners, cat people have it a bit more difficult as cats don't like water. Persian cat owner Vivek Kumar says, ""Since my cat has long fur, I get it trimmed during summer. I keep a pack of ice under its bed and keep its bed near the cooler. I wipe it occasionally with a wet sponge and then dry and brush its hair. I also make sure that it drinks plenty of water after every meal."" Guinea pig owner Jahanvi Bhushan Mishra feeds her pet snacks that are high in water content. ""My guinea pig does not like to drink much water, so its diet includes plenty of tomatoes, cucumber and watermelon. I dont keep it in its cage the whole day. It roams the house and sleeps under the bed in the afternoon. At night I keep its cage near the air conditioner so it can sleep peacefully.""During summer, zoo keepers have to make special arrangements for the animals. The director of Van Vihar National Park, Samita Rajora says, ""Our aim to keep the animals stress free so they dont fall sick. In their natural habitat they are able to tackle the heat, but here, they are dependent on us. We have created artificial water bodies so that they can take a dip and coolers have been installed too. The traditional way of cooling has been adopted by us. We have put screens made of khus-khus which is kept wet throughout the day. It cools very well. Wet hessian cloth is put on the enclosures as many animals prefer sitting outside.""Dr Brajesh Gupta points out three symptoms to watch out for in your pets. If they stop eating and sleep the whole day, or start vomiting or have loose stools. When these symptoms are noted, the pet should be taken to a vet. He shares, ""Animals are prone to heat stroke, so pet owners should give them special care. They should be given fresh food and water. Snimals like cats and dogs can be given curd which will help them with digestion. If you are traveling with your pets, make sure that they are kept at a stable temperature. Dont bathe them often as then their fur will lose its shine and the threat of tics will increase.""To help stray animals, Bhopalis are keeping bowls filled with grains and water outside their houses. Animal activist Swati Gaurav says, ""We have successfully placed cement containers through which the animals can quench their thirst. We are also planning to build permanent containers on the outskirts of the city which the highway animals can access.""- Farzana Patowari"

Thanks to a glut in the market and the steepest price drop witnessed in April in nearly a decade, tomatoes have become cheaper than even fodder. Tomato farmers claim they are getting just Rs 2 for every kg of produce, which does not even cover harvesting costs.Usually, tomato prices peak during April because of short supply due to high temperatures. However, statistics available with the Agricultural Marketing Information Network (AGMARKNET) show that the April-2018 prices are the lowest for the vegetable during this month in the past eight years. The tomato glut is evident in the Pune wholesale market as well, where 10 kg of the vegetable is available for between Rs 30 and Rs 80.Shriram Gadhave, the president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India , said this is the first time in several years that prices have hit such a low, almost 60% less than the same period last year. The water table has surged thanks to the rains last year, causing a supply surplus. The prices of many vegetables have dropped because of a glut in markets. Cattle owners in the city and nearby villages have now started taking large quantities of tomatoes and other vegetables left unsold to feed to cattle, he said.ND Ghule, assistant secretary, Agricultural Produce Market Committee, Pune, said the increase in tomato supplies led to a drop in prices. Vegetables such as tomato, eggplant and leaves of beetroot and cauliflower are in demand among them as they have become dirt cheap, he further said.The cattle farmers sometimes take 40 tonnes, or more, at a time for free to feed their cattle, added Sunil Kumbharkar, who owns a vegetable wholesale firm in Market Yard.Ramesh Jadhav, a farmer from Malegaon, says he does not know what to do with his 16-acre tomato plantation. Farmers, who are yet to harvest their tomato crops, are letting cattle loose on their fields so that at least they can be consumed by animals. For the first time in years, the per kilogram price we are getting for tomatoes has plummetted to Rs 2, which does not even meet the harvesting cost, he said. Last year, tomato prices had peaked during April, which is why farmers had sown more tomatoes this year, he said."
5b1b5f599855b76d57039789,Trump hosting glitzy White House state dinner for Macron,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/trump-hosting-glitzy-white-house-state-dinner-for-macron/articleshow/63889373.cms,2018-04-24,,The Times Of India,"WASHINGTON: Now it's President Donald Trump's turn to pull off the ultimate charm offensive.Wined and dined on multiple state visits during his tour of Asia last year, Trump is paying it forward and celebrating nearly 250 years of U.S.-French relations by playing host to President Emmanuel Macron at a glitzy White House state dinner on Tuesday.Months in the making, it's the first state visit and first big soiree of the Trump era in Washington ""It sounds like what they're planning will be spectacular,"" said Jeremy Bernard, who was White House social secretary in 2014, the last time the U.S. feted a French president.The White House has said little beyond the fact that dinner will be served, sticking to the tradition of trying to maintain an element of surprise for its guests.In fact, Macron will break bread twice with Trump.On Monday, the president and Melania Trump dined privately with Macron and his wife, Brigitte, at Mount Vernon, the home of America's first president, George Washington, on the banks of the Potomac River in Virginia. The White House had said the setting would serve as a reminder of France's ""unique status"" as America's first ally.Trump ended his first year without receiving a foreign leader on a state visit, making him the first president in nearly 100 years to do so and heightening the stakes for Tuesday.Dinner tickets are typically highly sought after by Washington's political and business elite. A few inklings of who's in and who's out already are known: Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, is in, as are House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky was invited, but his office said he is unable to attend.In a break with tradition, Trump invited no Democratic members of Congress or journalists, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the arrangements. But at least one Democrat will be in the crowd: the office of Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards confirmed his attendance.Approximately 150 guests will take their seats in the State Dining Room on Tuesday, making for a more intimate affair than those held by President Barack Obama. Obama's guest lists numbered into the hundreds, requiring that the event be held in a tented pavilion erected on the South Lawn because no room in the White House can accommodate that many people.Most of the responsibility for executing a flawless celebration falls to the first lady and her staff, including such key details as what is served (Trump likes wedge salads and chocolate cake) and poured into glasses (Trump wine?), who sits next to whom, who performs after dinner and what the decor looks like.One big moment is the first glimpse of the first lady in her gown. Fashion details are kept secret until the first couple steps on to the North Portico on Tuesday night to welcome their dinner guests.Former first lady Michelle Obama often used state dinners to showcase the talent of up-and-coming designers. Some designers have cited Trump's politics in refusing to dress the current first lady, a former model. Still, a likely choice would be Dior, the French design house whose fashions Mrs. Trump often wears, or Herve Pierre, the French-American who designed her inaugural gown and other looks.The last time a Republican president hosted his French counterpart was November 2007 when President George W. Bush welcomed the newly divorced Nicolas Sarkozy.More than 100 guests feasted on lobster bisque, lamb with tomato fondue, green beans and sweet potato casserole, salad and dessert served in the State Dining Room. Among the guests were major league baseball pitcher Tom Glavine, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, French chef Guy Savoy and several Louisiana politicians.After dinner, guests strolled down the hall to the East Room to watch performers in the roles of Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette, the Frenchman who served on Washington's staff in the Continental Army. Sarkozy toured Mount Vernon the following day.When Macron's limousine first pulls up the White House driveway on Tuesday morning, Trump, the first lady, White House and administration officials, and hundreds of invited guests will be waiting on the South Lawn. The pomp-filled arrival ceremony is for the man who became the youngest president in French history when he was elected in 2017 at age 39 on his first run for office.The visit also offers Macron his first Oval Office meeting and a joint White House news conference with Trump. There's also a State Department lunch hosted by Vice President Mike Pence before Macron and his wife arrive for the state dinner.The Trump-Macron relationship appeared to get off to a bumpy start with a white-knuckler of a handshake when the political novices met for the first time at a NATO summit in Brussels last May. But Macron likely sealed the bond after Trump accepted his invitation to attend the annual Bastille Day military parade in the center of Paris in July. Macron and his wife also took Trump and the first lady on a tour of Napoleon's tomb and whisked them up into the Eiffel Tower for dinner overlooking the City of Light. The experience led Trump to order up a military parade for downtown Washington later this year.But the two part company on some significant issues, including the Paris climate accord, which Trump withdrew the U.S. from last year, and the Iran-nuclear deal, another multinational agreement that Trump is itching to pull out of. The president did successfully rally Macron and British Prime Minister Theresa May, with whom Trump has sparred, to mount a joint military operation against Syria in response to an apparent chemical attack this month that killed Syrian civilians. Macron still worries about Trump's desire to remove U.S. troops from Syria.An art lover who speaks good English, Macron is known to watch what he eats. Yet he told reporters at an agricultural fair in Paris in February that ""I drink wine at lunch and dinner.""Discerning his tastes, including likes and dislikes, even allergies, is one of the first things the White House tries to pin down for all guests, said Bernard.""You're really focused on making sure the guest feels special,"" he said.Mrs. Trump's social secretary, Rickie Niceta, came aboard last year after two decades of event planning for a caterer whose clients included the White House, the State Department and several embassies, in addition to working on the past five presidential inaugurations, including Trump's. The first lady, who speaks French, also has experienced hands running the kitchen, pastry shop and florist's lair. All three women helped execute more than a dozen state dinners for Obama.Trump owns hotels, including one near the White House, and knows about good hospitality.Bernard recalled that, just as invitations were about to go out for the 2014 dinner for then-French President Francois Hollande, news broke that Hollande and his longtime girlfriend had abruptly split. Mrs. Obama's staff anxiously sought clarity on whether Hollande would bring another date.He didn't, and Bernard dealt with the awkwardness of the situation by seating Hollande between the two Obamas."
5b1b5f7d9855b76d57039795,"Popping pills to cure acidity often? Don’t, advise doctors",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/popping-pills-to-cure-acidity-often-dont-advise-doctors/articleshow/63885556.cms,2018-04-24,,The Times Of India,"PATNA: Medical experts have cautioned people against popping anti-acidity pills without medical prescription, especially during the summer.According to health experts, high temperature causes stomach related issues or digestive ailments. In a bid to find quick relief, people buy anti-acidity drugs, often the most potent ones, over the counter, which is a dangerous trend.The process of digestion involves the breakdown of food through the hydrochloric acid, which is naturally present in stomach. Health experts said frequent use of anti-acidity drugs can neutralize the effect of hydrochloric acid produced naturally by the stomach and alter the entire process of digestion. This can also cause kidney damage and osteoporosis.Regular use of such drugs without the supervision of professionals can alter the absorption of important elements like zinc, iron and chromium. The production of digestive enzymes will be hampered and, in the worst case, it can lead to kidney damage, said city-based physician Dr Diwakar Tejashwi.According to medical experts, anti-acidity drugs are mainly of three types  stomach acid neutralisers, or antacids that provide quick relief in the short term; H2 blockers that provide relief for up to 12 hours by inhibiting histamine, the stimulus for acid production in the stomach; and PPIs that produce greater acid suppression by preventing the acid from being secreted into the stomach.Doctors have advised people to prefer natural eatables like bananas, melons and coconut water to avoid the chances of acidity during the hot days. Dr Ramesh Kumar, a gastroenterologist at All India Institute of Medical Sciences AIIMS ), Patna, said the main reason behind stomach related ailments during summer was consumption of substandard edibles from roadside eateries.Water and food-borne bacterial infections, especially amoebic dysentery and diarrhoea, increase manifold during this time of the year. The major symptoms of such diseases are vomiting, food poisoning, loss of appetite, dehydration, constipation, heartburn, bloating and low blood pressure. To avoid such risks, one can avoid eating fried food items, cheese and the ones containing citric acids like tomatoes, tea, colas, coffee, as it can cause heartburn, Dr Ramesh said.He added small precautions can curb the risk of such diseases. Eating stale food, irregular meals and overeating can often lead to indigestion. Keep well hydrated and look for mineral water which contains bicarbonate as this aids digestion and reduces acidity, advised Dr Ramesh.According to general physician at AIIMS-Patna, Dr Ravi Kirti, mild digestion syrups can be taken in case of extreme restlessness as they protect the stomach lining and provide instant comfort to unbearable gastric symptoms. One should carry rehydrating salts before moving out in sun, by adding six teaspoons of sugar and half teaspoon of salt to a litre of water. Instead of relying on medicines, people should consume seasonal fruits and vegetables to keep their stomachs happy, Dr Kirti said."

Over the years, she came across many people, especially leprosy patients, with open sores and was determined to alleviate their suffering. Last Sunday, Angelin launched Wound Care On Wheels, an initiative wherein she and her team will clean and dress the wounds of those living on the streets.We will be taking dressing materials like betadine, gauze, gloves and approach people in need of help. We will get their permission before we do the dressing, says Angelin, director of The Candles that works in the field of mental and physical health. Along with a couple of colleagues, I will be visiting areas between Purusawalkam and Broadway , she says, adding that the team will start work from Friday and will be visiting the areas twice a week, as dressing needs to be changed.The Candles runs several projects, including awareness programmes on menstrual hygiene in schools and colleges across TN. As part of their project, Amudha Surabhi, the organisation gives health mix porridge to government school children. Feeding the homeless is part of their Share With Care programme. We distribute food thrice a month in the areas between Anna Nagar and Broadway. We get parotta and kurma or idlis from hotels, says Angelin. Or our volunteers cook vegetable or tomato rice.And thats when they came across people on the streets who needed medical aid. Many of them have wounds that are not bandaged properly or are covered with dirty rags, says Angelin. They are hesitant to go to a government hospital as they have to wait in long queues. We did do dressing for a few people but then thought we should have a sustained programme. Angelin, who has done a diploma in hand and leprosy physiotherapy, prefers to use the term Hansens disease instead of leprosy. Stigma still exists around the word leprosy, she says.At the moment, they will be using their own bikes to get around. We are looking for donors who can help us with basic medical supplies or an autorickshaw for us to go around, says Angelin. Psychologist Dr Mini Rao, who has been involved with the NGO for several years says, Many still hesitate to interact with people with leprosy. This initiative will touch several lives."

The spicy mix traditionally comes in a scooped-out potato cup (kulle) but vendors are now experimenting with fruits, tomato and cucumber as the base. Made popular by food walks, this new avatar of kulle chaat is lapped up by tourists and shoppers in Chawri Bazaar and Sitaram Bazaar, but Purani Dilli frowns on these upstarts who have tinkered with the original.How can you make kulle with tomato? agonises Ashok Mathur , 48, a fifth-generation Old Delhi resident, who has grown up eating Sultans Kulle in his neighbourhood. Kulle used to be only made of aloo or shakarkandi (sweet potato). The spicier, the better! This was followed by a cup of tea, Mathur recounts, sitting in his 100-year-old home in Roshanpura.Arun Kashyap , 32, sits at the same spot where his great grandfather, Sultan Singh, parked himself on a raised platform outside a Jain household, in a narrow bylane that runs parallel to Nai Sadak Kashyap says he has grown up hearing tales of the legendary Mukesh  the singers family lived in Old Delhis Chelpuri  eating kulle made by his great grandfather when he was a roaming hawker with a khomcha (stand).Banana was the first fruit our family experimented with for customers who liked fruit chaat but didnt want the traditional aloo as the base for kulle. Now, we make it with more fruits but the regulars insist on aloo, says Kashyap, who also serves aloo chaat and tikki.The aloo is sand-baked at a bhatti in the Old Subzi Mandi area in the morning. By afternoon it reaches Roshanpura, where Kashyap scoops out the middle to make space for the filling.He starts with a few pinches of a homemade masala which, Kashyap says, has 36 ingredients. This is followed by boiled chana (small chickpeas), kala namak, roasted jeera powder, black pepper, boora (powdered sugar), pomegranate seeds, a squeeze of lemon and finally topped with sliced ginger.This was a vantage point when Sultan set up base here 80 years ago; but changing demography and competition from chaat vendors on the main roads, have made life tough for his great grandson.But support from the local community has kept Sultans kulle going. We use the space outside a Jain familys house but they dont charge us. They let us store our wares inside, and even pay for the kulle they consume, says Kashyap.His chaat still draws members of the Mathur families, who once occupied most houses in this neighbourhood. Today, the homes have given way to shops and godowns. Sultans masala runs in our blood, says Ashok Mathur, talking nostalgically about how people used to choke the lane during Ramlila celebrations to relish the kulle served on dhak patta.So, next time you take Nai Sadak to cross over from the food streets of Chandni Chowk to Jama Masjid , do try out this palate cleanser."

Unable to recover even the production cost, distressed farmers are dumping the produce in fields and on roads in Sehore, Narsinghpur and Raisen districts.Market reports disclosed price of tomato crashed to Re 1 and even 50 paisa per kg in some districts forcing farmers to seek government intervention. Reports from Sehore - the home district of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Narsinghpur and Raisen- reveal price variation is hitting farmers hard.In Budhni (Sehore) and Gadarwara (Narsinghpur) dumping of tomato on the roadside has become a common sight. Tomato growers said there was a glut in the market as more farmers took to its cultivation, . Moreover, a slump in demand in neighbouring states also contributed to the crash in price. Farmers in more than a 12-13 districts cultivated tomato on a large scale, resulting in lesser demand for tomatoes, they said.""In August-September last year, farmers sold tomatoes for as high as Rs 50 to Rs 70 per kg due to high demand. Now, the price has crashed to 50 to 60 paisa a kg in the wholesale market, which is less than the production cost. But in retail, the crop is being sold for Rs 10 per kg. Farmers are compelled to dump tomatoes on roadside as a mark of protest,"" said a farmer of Gadarwara.In Nasarullaganj and Shahganj - the two main areas under the assembly constituency of the chief minister- farmers are not even able to recover transportation cost. Mahesh , a farmer from Shahganj claimed in a field of two acre, he spent Rs 10,000 on seeds, Rs 9,000 on pesticides, Rs 3,000 on irrigation and Rs 50,000 on labour. But, could not recover the cost for which he had drawn a bank loan of Rs 5 lakh. Minister of state for agriculture Balkrishna Patidar said those who are dumping tomatoes on roadside are not farmers, but protesters. Farmers never dump their hard-earned produce. Farmers know well the price fluctuation. Otherwise they would not have opted for tomato crop, the minister said.""The demonstrations are planned and farmers are not involved in dumping of their produce. Price fluctuation is a normal process. At times, farmers had earned Rs 50 per kg, when there was a demand. Now, they have to sell it at a lesser margin. Had farmers not earned benefit last year, they would not have opted for the same crop this year,"" Patidar told TOI."

The market authorities claim that the area is cleaned twice a day.The garbage bins are almost overflowing and even the space outside the shops is littered with leftovers. Rotting vegetables and fruits seems to be scattered on the road. During a visit to the grain market on Tuesday, the TOI team found few of the shopkeepers dumping rotten tomato and potato in the open and on the streets. Due to this, the passersby and customers looking for vegetables and fruits were facing a lot of problems. The market's roadsides were full of dirt, junk material, and garbage.Some of the vendors had pitched their carts on the muddy patches and their vegetables and fruits witnessed had dirt all over. And many people were buying these items, too. To the naked eye, these items seemed injurious to health. The loading and unloading of trucks was in progress on the main road inside the market, which had jammed this passage.Vegetable peels flies into the eyes of the customers and commuters. Even many of the shopkeepers sitting in the ground were found to be uncomfortable because of the stinking environment they had created themselves. Dustbins in the market had not been emptied in days. Most of these were either broken or not in a usable condition. Encroachment around the main gate and the inside main road was rampant. Rows and rows of trucks occupied the middle of the road. The other vehicles didn't have space to even squeeze past.Sector-26 grain market secretary M K Sharma said: ""Every day, we collect garbage in the trollies. This problem recurs after every spell of rain and we had been facing it for the past many years. All problems stem from the disorderly traffic. One of the alternatives is to shift the grain market to Sector 39. Because of the crowd, we are unable to collect waste from each corner. This waste is dumped outside the city. The marked generates waste in bulk indeed.""Bablu, a shopkeeper at the grain market, said: ""This market is cleaned twice a day but most of the shopkeepers chuck their waste on to the road and litter the interior areas as well. Even though they are responsible for the problem, most of the big shopkeepers do not accept their responsibility or behave in a disciplined manner.""The customers at the market attributed many problems to all the dirt, garbage, and unpleasant smell generated from the place. Sector 28 resident Sheetal Chaturvedi said: ""The market doesn't have toilet facilities. The MC officials and the market committee have not taken appropriate steps for the improvement of civic facilities in the area."""

With market forces, particularly commission agents, influencing prices in the regulated markets, farmers often struggled to get remunerative prices. In fact, tomato growers throwing their dumping their produce during peak season has become a routine affair. During these events, farmers blamed the traders syndicate.After carefully studying the situation, the state government issued a GO de-notifying vegetables and fruits from Andhra Pradesh Markets (agriculture produces and livestock) Act. The de-notification will reduce the price gap between producers and consumers through reduction in intermediary supply chain and creation of alternative marketing channels, said agriculture minister Somireddy Chandramohan Reddy . He said it would also promote investment on development of marketing infrastructure with private sector participation.The move is expected to bring down the prices in the retail market as growers are free to sell the stocks anywhere in the state besides enhancing farmers profit.

5b1c4d3e9855b74aba67c3b9,Reducing post-harvest losses the main challenge: Researchers,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/reducing-post-harvest-losses-the-main-challenge-researchers/articleshow/63405223.cms,2018-03-22,,The Times Of India,"The biggest problem affecting the countrys agriculture and the agricultural market is post-harvest losses, say experts. Annually, the country loses about Rs 2,40,000 crore through the post-harvest wastage of fruits and vegetables, says G J Janavi , head of the department of nano science and technology, TNAU India is the second largest producer of fruits and vegetables, after China. But there are several post-harvest losses from the producer to the consumer, she says. This is because of the lack of proper harvest practices, transportation and cold storage facilities, she adds. She says that around 35% to 40% of fruit and vegetable produce are wasted.The department of nano science and technology at TNAU has been trying to reduce post-harvest losses of fruits at all links of the supply chain, say researchers at the department. While the spraying of Enhanced Freshness Formulation (EFF) on mango trees prior harvest and dipping of mangoes and bananas in EFF solution slows down ripening, and control losses at farm level, researchers have come up with methods to control losses in package houses, transportation and retail shops.The department has devised and patented a technology where EFF is injected into nanofibres, which are coated on a strip of foil or paper or infused in a pellet, which is placed in a fruit carton. The hexanal in the EFF vaporizes, which is imbibed by the fruits, resulting in increased shelf life, says K S Subramanian , professor at the department and the principal investigator of the project.Also, a transparent film made of nano-cellulose extracted from banana fibre, which is infused with EFF, when used as a cover slows down ripening and brings down losses in tomatoes, said Subramanian.We are also working on bringing down losses during transportation. In the vaporization method, hexanal is made to vaporize in a chamber where fruits are kept. This can be done in a truck when the fruits are being carried to long distances, he adds.Farmers say such technologies would help them a lot when they export fruits. It takes 10 days to take fruits by sea to Singapore, 25 for Australia and 28 for the US. If such a technology is used in the container, the losses could be controlled in an easy and effective way, says P Pugazhendhi, 58, from Krishnagiri , who runs a firm which exports fruits."

Balwant, who owns around 40 acre farmland on very tough terrain, is a worried man as the prices of tomatoes have crashed. A vehicle full of tomato crates sent to Kalamna wholesale market was brought back without selling the produce, since it was fetching a very low price of Rs50 a crate, which comes to just Rs2 a kg. The recent weather has weakened the yield and reduced its shelf life, said Balwant, who, left with no option, decided to feed the tomato yield to his cattle.Balwant said it doesnt make sense to sell tomatoes at Rs2 a kg as it does not recover even the basic expenses involved like seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, transportation and commission to agents.Pandurang Tarare, another villager involved in traditional farming, said he too was very depressed when he heard that the rates of tomatoes have gone below Rs50 per crate. He plans to wait another week, otherwise he would also feed the yield to his bullocks. He said the Centre should do something as farmers are facing hardships, especially in Vidarbha region.Shriram Ghadhave, president of Vegetable Growers Association of India (VGAI), said Maharashtra has seen a 10-15% rise in area under cultivation for tomatoes. Previously, farmers from western Maharashtra used to go for vegetable crops but in recent times farmers from Vidarbha and Marathwada too have started growing vegetables. He also attributed this growth to the good rainfall in the state last year. As against 2.5 lakh hectares of tomato cultivation, this year we have about 3 lakh hectares, he said.Lately, farmers have increased cultivation of vegetables as it ensures cash flow in the short term. This takes care of their immediate needs. However, as the number of farmers growing vegetables apart from their main stay crop has increased, it has led to an oversupply as well. Its not only tomato, rates of other vegetables like brinjal, ladyfinger and cauliflower too have gone down throughout the region, said farmers as well as farm activists.Locally grown vegetables, including tomatoes, are fetching a price within Rs2-4 a kg. In some cases, its just a couple of rupees, say market sources.Kishore Tiwari of Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission (VNSSM)  the state government agency to tackle farm crisis  said if its tomatoes in Nagpur, in Yavatmal farmers have ended up in losses in brinjal and ladyfinger.The rates of main crops like soyabean and cotton are already down. Now, there is a slump in vegetables which are grown to supplement income by farmers. There is no system of MSP for vegetables, he said.Farmers having irrigation facilities used to go for crops like wheat or gram. These days, vegetables are being preferred as well. This has led to a glut in Wardha. Farmers are not able to recover expenses in cauliflower cultivation, said Vijay Jawandhia, a former Shetkari Sanghathana activist from Wardha.Vijay Ingle from Akola, a farmer who had bagged state government award for best practices, also confirmed that in his area farmers were setting aside an acre or half for vegetables. The rates are down due to oversupply, he said.Meanwhile, Nandkishore Gaur, president of vegetable traders at Kalamna Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) yard, said rates are expected to increase in the coming months.Tomatoes are reaped for four months, so farmers have a chance to recover their losses. Normally, the crop is grown in the month of October. However, these days large number of farmers in areas like Ramtek and Tumsar Road in Nagpur district have gone for the January crop, which will continue till April. At the same time, there are arrivals from other states like bordering Madhya Pradesh and Telangana as well. The supplies will recede after April, and the rates are expected to increase then, he said."
5b1c85799855b74aba67c87b,"Do apologies, in public or on social media, resurrect damaged reputations?",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/do-apologies-in-public-or-on-social-media-resurrect-damaged-reputations/articleshow/63358553.cms,2018-03-19,,The Times Of India,"Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal represents a different breed of politicians. He had perfected guerilla warfare, both in public and on social media networks, with startling allegations as his preferred ammunition. Politicians feared him, because in this era and time, allegations carry more value.Kejriwal and his colleagues, in early 2016, had hurled an allegation against Shiromani Akali Dal leader Bikram Singh Majithia , who promptly filed a defamation suit. It is far easier to dabble in innuendoes than proving it in a court of law. Cornered by law and litigation, Kejriwal has apologised, albeit two years later. Majithia appears to have accepted the apology and promised to withdraw the defamation case.Are apologies enough to mend damaged reputations? Does delay in tendering apology take away from sincerity and intent behind the regret? What about social media networks, especially Twitter, where all and sundry hurl innuendoes, abuses and allegations like tomatoes in Spains La Tomatina ? Should there be a special law to deal with social media networks? In India, where a dragging defamation case adds salt to wounded reputation, Sections 499 and 500 of IPC (criminal defamation) or a civil suit for damages are no solution to rein in disparaging comments on social media hurled from fake handles. In India, apologies come not from the heart or conviction, but only when the offender gets cornered by litigation or political expediency.For the November 1984 anti-Sikh carnage, it took Congress more than 20 years to issue an apology. Then PM Manmohan Singh had said in 2005, I have no hesitation in apologising to the Sikh community. For the 2002 post-Godhra riots, a formal apology is yet to come though Narendra Modi had said in 2013, Anyway you look at it, it was a shameful blot on the image of Vibrant Gujarat.In legal circles, apologies are not considered an acceptable method to avoid legal consequences in a defamation case, though it may help reduce the rigour of penalty. This is because an apology may assuage hurt but not mend the damaged reputation.Indian constitutional courts, in general, let off a person facing contempt proceedings for disparaging remarks against a judge or judiciary, if the person tenders unqualified and unconditional apology. In defamation cases, an apology reflecting that the offender is sorry and says so publicly helps release the steam. But apology has many hues and contexts  from simply saying sorry to acknowledging the wrongdoing and taking full responsibility for the fallout.In the famous New York Times vs Sullivan case, the US Supreme Court in 1964 imposed a higher standard for a public servant to seek damages against a person who makes defamatory remarks against her/him. Under this standard, public official plaintiff must show that the defendant acted with knowledge that the allegations were false or made with reckless disregard of truth.But 10 years later, the same US SC in Gertz vs Robert Welch refused to extend the same standard to defamation cases involving private individuals, saying they were more vulnerable to injury from defamation. The crux of this judgment was public officials had an opportunity to rebut fallacies, which was not available to private individuals. Last year, UKs High Court of Justice, Queens Bench Division, gave a trend-setting judgment in Jackie Monroe vs Katie Hopkins , which will serve as a lesson for Twitter gladiators with hired troll armies across the world.Monroe sued Hopkins for a disparaging tweet that featured during a war of words over Twitter after the Conservative Party formed government in May 2015 followed by a violent anti-austerity demonstration which vandalised Memorial to the Women of World War II in Whitehall. Indians, who often come across virulently disparaging tweets, will find Hopkinss tweet harmless and ignorable. After vandalisation of the memorial, Hopkins tweeted, @MsJackMonroe scrawled on any memorials recently? Vandalised the memory of those who fought for your freedom. Grandma got any more medals? It was re-tweeted several times and Monroe was trolled heavily. In reply, Monroe tweeted, I have never scrawled on a memorial. Brother in RAF. Dad was a Para in the Falklands. You are a piece of shit.The exchanges thereafter reflected Monroe requesting Hopkins to delete the abusive tweet, followed by a demand for an apology and a donation of 5,000 pounds for charity.Hopkins deleted the tweet two hours later, did not donate, and posted another tweet, Can someone explain to me - in 10 words or less - the difference between irritant @PennyRed and social anthrax @Jack Monroe Monroe sued Hopkins after newspapers published articles on the unsavoury exchange.Hopkins later tried to make amends by posting a tweet, partially on the lines suggested by Monroe, to admit she was confused about the identity and that she got it wrong. Dissatisfied, Monroe continued with the proceedings. The UK HC rejected Hopkinss defence that the tweet was deleted after two hours and had limited public life. It said, Any tweet disappears from readers view as time goes on. But this is a weak point. What matters, when considering transience, is not the period of time for which a person is exposed to the message but the impact the message has. It is a commonplace of experience that live broadcasts can have a powerful impact even if the viewer sees them only once.

The rising temperature has caused a fall in groundwater level and reduced crop yield. The Koyambedu wholesale vegetable market, which used to receive 400-450 truckloads of vegetables every day three months ago, received only 350 loads on Friday.In three months, the price of green beans has gone up from Rs15-Rs20 per kg to Rs30-Rs50 per kg at the Koyambedu market. At neighbourhood retail stores, green beans was selling for Rs60 per kg on Friday.Yield from the years second crop (April to June) is 30% less than the yield from first crop which is harvested from December to March. Prices of tomato, beetroot, cauliflower, radish and turnip have increased by about 30%, while prices of onion, sambar onion, capsicum and brinjal have decreased marginally. Prices of all vegetables will rise from the third week of April by 10%, according to Koyambedu Wholesale Traders Welfare Association treasurer P G M Sukumar.Sukumar said, Prices began to go up from the first week of March last year due to a failed monsoon. This year, however, prices will only rise gradually, thanks to sufficient rainfall. Except for coastal Andhra, all other parts of the southern peninsula registered normal rainfall during the recent northeast monsoon.Prices of tomato in April last year was Rs18, while this year it is only Rs10-Rs12. Likewise, the price of carrot was Rs35 last year compared to Rs15-Rs20 this year."

But for the bulk orders, we have to make eight-ten packages at a time, which is very time consuming. Business has slowed down by 40% due to this, said vendor Hazrat Haldewale Meanwhile, several vendors have alternatively started stocking cloth bags worth Rs 10 or Rs 20, depending on size, although the move has not yet worked out in their favour. Customers will not purchase a bag worth Rs 10 to carry greens worth Rs 20. People must also be advised by the government to carry bags from home, said vendor Hyder Ali.While vegetable vendors are still managing to function, those who sell of pulses and grains are in bigger trouble. The government should have thought of an alternative for businesses like ours. We approached the CCP and they said to charge people for paper bags. Doing that will further decrease our customers, since they will prefer to go to the mall and buy readymade packets of rice instead of coming to the market. We have already seen a 45% decrease in profits after the ban, said vendor Nitin Mandrekar Many others, however, are very optimistic about this change. Miramar-resident Joseph Ferrao said, In olden days we used to carry our own bag to the market. Now, that good practice is making a comeback.We sell high-value vegetables like cherry tomatoes whose cost goes up in hundreds per kilogram. Customers dont mind paying an extra Rs 10 to purchase a cloth bag. We make Rs 5 on the bag, so the ban has actually worked in our favour, said vendor Sadiq Shaikh.Naomi M from Pilerne said, The services of some self-help groups must be utilised to make and provide newspaper bags. They are very common in Mumbai and the practice can be adopted here as well. The vendors can charge a nominal amount for it. This way, plastic bags are replaced, paper is recycled and someone gains employment."

When I checked the root, it looked as if it had galls. Galls are knot-like structures caused by root-knot nematodes. But, we were not sure about it as root-knot nematodes in citrus were not present in Tamil Nadu, she said.Poornima visited the farm and dug up a live sapling. We found that the sapling was infected with root-knot nematodes. In the past few months, we found instances of root-knot nematode infections in citrus saplings in farms in Coimbatore and Erode districts. Researchers here are working on battling the nematode, she said.Nematodes enter the roots of fruit, vegetable and flower saplings through the root tip. After two to three months, they breed and block the conducting vessels of the plant, causing it to wilt. Root-knot nematodes, meanwhile, enter the roots, where they lay eggs, which form knot-like structures that bulge out of the root. The knots then rupture and the young nematodes go in search of new roots.Nematodes mainly affect fruit and vegetable crops such as tomato, guava, pomegranate, cucumber and capsicum, said Poornima. Tomato and cucumber plants are the major victims, she added.There are also instances where there have been heavy losses in guava, said the head of nematology department, S Subramanian. Over the past four to five years, several new varieties of guava were introduced in the state. They have been affected by nematodes and have caused severe losses to farmers, he added. The annual loss in fruit crops due to nematodes was pegged at 13%, he said.The department has been researching how to tackle the nematode menace and also has been helping farmers and nursery owners. Beneficial fungi such as Paecilomyces and Pochonia are known to inhibit nematode growth, said Poornima. We have been producing the fungi and selling it to farmers. The fungi can be mixed with soil or the saplings can be dipped in the liquid formation of the fungi before being planted. Also, simple methods such as exposing the soil to sunlight will kill nematodes, she added.The department has been conducting awareness workshops on nematodes for both farmers and nursery owners, Poornima added."

According to police, Dalia used to siphon off the daily collections of Mirch Masala and the royalty amount of Tomatos.A police official said that to show the siphoned off money in books of accounts, Dalia made duplicate fixed deposit receipts and forged bank statements to show them to the owners. Police sources said that Dalia even forged signatures of the owners of the company and increased overdraft limit to Rs 90 lakh. Dalia withdrew Rs 87 lakh through overdraft facility and kept the owners in dark. Police said that the accused indulged in fraudulent activities since 2011 which came to light in September 2016 when the owners asked him to transfer Rs 36 lakh from the fixed deposit to Ahmedabad. The company wanted the money to buy furniture for its new restaurant in Ahmedabad.According to police complaint filed by the CMD of AHPL Rushad Ginwala , the scam had come to light when Dalia did not transfer the money for several days and stopped answering calls. When the companys account manager and general manager approached Corporation Bank in the city, they learnt that no fixed deposits were made, instead the company owes Rs 87 lakh to the bank which were withdrawn by Dalia as overdraft.Officials at Gotri police station said that Dalia was on run for 18 months and was nabbed on Friday.

The initiative was conceived earlier this year by teachers to encourage students to be senitive to the environment.The school has started an eco-club and roped in students as members. Manoj Kumar, head teacher, said, I joined the school nine months ago. At that time, there was not a single plant in the school. So, we asked students to go to neighbouring areas and collect old plants.Students managed to collect at least 170 plants in a week after which the school got in touch with Give me trees, a Delhi-based NGO which focuses on community-based voluntary tree planting and conservation. The trust asked us if hydroponic plantation could be introduced in the school and we agreed to do the same, said Kumar.Give me trees roped in Honda, which donated Rs 3.5 lakh from its CSR funds for the project. Vaneet Bhalla, a volunteer with Give me trees, said, The concept of hydroponics is new in the country but it gives big results. It involves growing healthy plants without the use of a traditional soil medium, using a nutrient and mineral-rich water solution. Hydroponic plantation requires less water in comparison to the traditional way. A hydroponic plant needs some nutrients, water, and sunlight and all this is available in the school.The school chose its rooftop to set up the garden. The plants are put on pipes. This requires less space as the plants grow vertically, said Bhalla.Students look after the plants. Vegetables such as cabbage, capsicum, green chilli, ladys finger and tomato are grown. When the vegetables are fully grown, we will distribute them among students, said Kumar.The system requires the school to ensure water circulation through hydroponic pipes. The school makes two teachers stay in the school overnight to switch on the motor when water supply is there. The school has eight teachers. We dont have helpers such as gardeners or guards. So, we decided to take care of this ourselves. We stay in the school to switch on the motor in the evening and early morning. We also sprinkle organic pesticides on the plants, said Manjeet Mann , a teacher.The school plans to increase the number of hydroponic plants to 3,500 in the next couple of days. Sub-divisional magistrate Sanjeev Singhla said, I really appreciate the work students have done to grow soil-less plants. Other schools should also encourage this initiative."

Prices of regular varieties like rohu, katla, tangra and pabda have shot up by Rs 75-150 a kg following a surge in demand.While fish has always been a part of the daily diet of an average Bengali household, now even other communities, who prefer meat for their dietary needs, have suddenly discovered their love for fish. In Bengali households where mutton and chicken dishes usually figure on the Sunday menu, it has been fish all the way these past couple of weeks.Not just homes, even restaurants and caterers have reported a shift from mughlai, continental and Chinese cuisines to Bengali that has a wide variety of fish dishes on the menu.Price of fish across categories has gone up by 17-20% in the wholesale market. It is a record high. We have never traded fish at this price, said Howrah Wholesale Fish Market Association secretary Syed Anwar Maqsood.The rise in fish prices in the wholesale market has translated to an even steeper hike in retail prices, but the demand surge has not led to a supply shortage. State fisheries minister Chandrakanta Sinha confirmed there was enough supply in the market to meet the demand. Yet, prices have continued to soar.At municipal markets in Gariahat, Lake Market, New Market and Manicktala, price of katla has shot up from Rs 240 a kg a couple of weeks ago to Rs 350-400. Rohu has gone up from Rs 130 to Rs 160-170.Market observers put the sharp hike in prices to opportunism at the retail end. A retail fish seller senses the demand and accordingly hikes the price to maximise his profit. That is whats happened, said Jagannath Raut of Behala wholesale fish market.Caterers are having a harrowing time with clients demanding major changes in the menu at the 11th hour. According to Sandip Das of Diamond Caterer, mutton and chicken items have nearly disappeared from the menu. Now everyone is demanding that meat items be replaced by fish and prawn. This has thrown the costing of dishes haywire, said Das.We are reinventing a lot of fish dishes to stay afloat, said Sujoy Ghosh of Bhawanipores Ghosh Caterers. Reshmi kebab and mutton do peyazja have been replaced with prawn cutlet and fish coriander. Baked tomato betki has edged out roast mutton.In restaurants, too, fish and prawn items are moving faster than usual. Peter Cat and Mocambo owner Nitin Kothari said the slump in demand for chicken and mutton items was significant.Metro Cash and Carry, the leading business-to-business wholesaler that supplies both meat and fish to most big hotels and restaurants in the city, has also experienced a sharp rise in demand for fish."

Apart from coriander, cauliflower too has gone beyond the reach of middle class families, putting extensive pressure on household budgets. On the other hand, prices of the most consumed vegetables like tomato, onion, brinjal, and okra have gone down due to surplus growth of the crops in farms across northern India.Joginder Singh, one of the vendors in the citys busiest vegetable market, said due to bad weather conditions across the northern parts of the country, vegetable prices may increase in the coming days, but at present, the prices of most consumed vegetables are under control, and so people were satisfied with the prices. However, prices of a few other vegetables continued to remain high, as they are mostly transported from far-off places.Another vendor, Shambu Parsad, said due to lower vegetables prices of the most consumed vegetables, vendors were facing hardship dealing with their daily needs. One of the reasons behind the price increase of healthy vegetables like broccoli, peas, and capsicum was due to the fact that they are mostly grown in cold places, so as winter ends, the prices shoot up.Meanwhile, residents  especially women  who have to run their kitchens were not much upset, as the prices of most vegetables were not very high these days. Dilpreet Kaur stated: Green vegetables are still far from the reach of middle class families, as the central government has no policy to control their prices, so that even middle class families can consume them without any hesitation.RETAIL PRICESVegetablePrices in April last weekPrices in May first weekPrices at presentCoriander80-9090-100100-120Onion35-4030-3525-30Broccoli80-9090-100100-110Capsicum (red, yellow)60-7070-80100-120Bitter melon40-5035-4020-25Okra40-5035-4030-35Tomato40-5030-4025-30"

Three months on, they have some reason to cheer. Wholesale potato prices now range from Rs 9 to Rs 22 a kilogram and are not expected to slide anytime soon. As demand rises, market experts feel prices will rise further, by up to 60%.One reason is that the quantity of potatoes in cold storage is currently 20% less than last year. Officials said that potatoes are currently commanding higher prices than onions and tomatoes. The wholesale price of onions currently ranges between Rs 3.50 and Rs 9 per kilogram, while tomatoes are selling for between Rs 6 and Rs 9 a kilogram.Potato prices have been rising for a fortnight and market officials believe they will climb further. We are seeing wide fluctuations in the wholesale market. Any tightening of supply will raise prices further, says Deepak Patel , secretary of the Ahmedabad Agricultural Produce Market Committee.Market officials met traders who said prices will not rise if demand remains at the same level, Patel said.Ashish Guru, president of the Gujarat Cold Storage Association , says, There are at least one crore 50-kg bags fewer at cold storages in Gujarat compared to 2017. Further, Uttar Pradesh, a major potato producing state, has registered a fall in production. Farmers have not been getting remunerative prices for their produce and have hence moved away potato to more lucrative crops.Guru said the Gujarat government last year gave Rs 40 as subsidy to potato farmers. Only 4.09 crore 50-kg bags have been stored this year. The number was 5.10 crore bags in 2017. Cold storage capacity in the state is 5.75 crore bags.Guru said the drop in potato production this year has brought some relief to farmers at the cost of higher prices for consumers.According to potato traders, farmers in major potato producing states collectively reduced the acreage sown with the tuber last year by 5% to 7%, after two straight years of gluts in the market. The reduced acreage has led to a 10% to 20% fall in potato output."

Earlier, there was a farmers agitation which affected the veggie supply to the city; many farmers were also not able to sell their produces in mandi. There was a general assumption that there is a shortage in the city, hence, farmers from nearby areas like Bassi and Kaladera started coming to Muhana to sell their produces, Tanwar said.The dealers told TOI that many of the rural vegetable and fruit shops like in Bassi and Chomu have seen business being affected due to the stir, causing severe losses to the farmers. The temperature is soaring; therefore farmers cannot store their produces for a very long time.

It started with some unknown persons ringing the bell and running away but soon spiralled into house invasion, spraying of noxious substances and writing love letters with tomato ketchup.So much so that the hapless woman has left the city temporarily and will vacate the house -- where she lives with her brother -- once she returns. Before leaving for her hometown, she filed a complaint with the Madiwala police. A case has been lodged under section 354-D (which deals with punishment for a person who follows a woman and contacts, or attempts to contact, her to foster personal interaction repeatedly despite a clear indication of disinterest) of the Indian Penal Code.The brother-sister duo stay on the second floor of a multi-storied building at Venkatapura, in Madiwala.

Her friend reached the house but Divya had bolted it from inside. My sister was not able to get up and open the door. I reached home and managed to get inside to find her very sick. We took her to the hospital and then filed a complaint with the police, her brother said.Divya said she works the night shift and trouble generally starts when her brother leaves for office in the morning. I sleep during the day. For the past two months, somebody had been ringing the bell between 10.30 am and 2 pm. But when I open the door, there would be nobody. The pattern used to repeat every three to four days. But it doesnt happen on Sundays when my brother is home, she added.The brother-sister duo even tried to catch the culprits red-handed, with disastrous, near-fatal results. I had taken my sister out shopping and decided to catch them when we returned home. I stayed back in the opposite building while my sister stood in the corridor outside our main door. Two youths in their mid-twenties appeared and my sister raised an alarm. They pushed her from behind and she almost fell from the corridor but managed to balance herself by holding on to the parapet. I rushed to catch the duo but couldnt find them, he said. After the incident, they approached the Madiwala police who checked the building and suspicious persons around it. When they found nothing, they asked us to call them if we found the miscreants again, he said.He then installed two CCTV cameras in the corridor. But they did not come for at least three days. Then, my sister found a letter in the bathroom; it had love quotes and one-liners written with tomato ketchup. They started dropping letters from bathroom window daily. Once they wrote 2 camera ha ha, he said, adding the quotes were in English, Telugu and Kannada. Next day we got another letter warning us of dire consequences if we complained to the police. After five days, there was a rotten smell in the bathroom; initially, my sister suspected it to be gas leakage or acid cleaning. After a couple of days, she again noticed the putrid smell, he said. We dont know if someone known to us is doing this, but they are observing my sisters movements and targeting her. She is scared it could be black magic too, he added.Madiwala police said they had collected CCTV footage from the building and will nab the miscreants at the earliest.Till then, Divyas nightmare will continue; just like Kirans (played by Juhi Chawla) in Darr."

But he eventually spent more time studying chemistry and obtained his PhD in 1899.Sorensen did most of his research in Carlsberg Laboratories. He became the director of its chemical section in 1901. While at Carlsberg, Sorensen started to study amino acids, proteins and enzymes.As hydrogen ion concentration played a key role in enzymatic reactions he devised a simple way of expressing it, according to EuCheMS, the European Association for Chemical and Molecular Sciences.He found that by taking a negative logarithm of hydrogen ion concentration a convenient scale can be established. This is the well-known pH value.He also developed buffer solutions to maintain constant pH of solutions (Sorensen buffers), EuCheMS noted in a short biography of the scientist in its website.The Google Doodle on Tuesday allows users to see for themselves the pH value of different food items, including tomatoes and eggs in a scale of 1 to 14.Sorensen retired from his post at Carlsberg in 1938.

You can have them scrambled, boiled, curried, poached, baked, basted, fried sunny side up and even whisked raw in coffee. Additionally, they play the role of binder, thickener, emulsifier and vitalizer. Want to give definition and bounce to your hair? Simply slap an egg on your scalp!As a protein source, eggs are a delight for both weight-watchers and those building muscle. But none desires eggs more than the hungry soul who is either low on budget or shorn of a wholesome eating option late at night.Shabbir Shaikh comes to the rescue here. The 39-year-old has been running a handcart selling egg dishes outside the Shivajinagar railway station for the past 20 years. He conducts business till 3am, moving his cart into a nondescript lane adjoining the station after midnight.On an average, Shaikh uses 300 eggs daily but sticks to just three dishes  bhurji, omelette and half fry (renamed palti if flipped over). Each dish, which comes with four pavs, is priced at Rs 50 till midnight and Rs 60 thereafter. Interestingly, Shaikh says rail and bus passengers are not his chief clientele  word of mouth about his food draws in regular customers from as far as Pimpri and Hinjewadi.Like Shaikh, most stalls and handcarts in the city restrict their egg menu to not more than four or five dishes. Yash Pawar, owner of Pune Egg Cafe on Senapati Bapat Road, says this is very unlike Gujarat, especially Surat and Vadodara, where stalls have around 25-30 different egg dishes on their list.The 24-year-old Pawar, who grew up in Vadodara and came here to study at Symbiosis, has more than 50 egg items on his menu, with the average pricing being Rs 100. He says his chef, who is from Vadodara, can rustle up 300 types of egg dishes. Pawar offers eggs in rice, gravies and parathas, and as starters or omelettes. His trademark dishes are the ghotala (of Surat fame), boiled egg tikka masala and egg-kheema rice. And, yes, the place satisfies late-night food cravings.Pawar says he uses only Amul butter for his dishes. So does Dnyaneshwar Narvankar, the franchise owner of the newly-started eggs-only Raju Omlet at Vimannagar. Now, the Omlet is no typo; it has been retained in the name boards of all 12 outlets of the brand  six of them in Gujarat and one each in Mumbai, Pune, Dubai, Sharjah, Pattaya and the US.All outlets have a fixed menu of 13 dishes, and each dish uses 50 gms of butter. The dishes are priced up to Rs 170, and the best-sellers are the green boiled egg tikka and the crush omelette. Narvankar says the outlets do not believe in experimenting with too many dishes, though he points out that one can find more than 1,000 egg recipes across Gujarat. The Vadodara outlet, from where the business started, uses a whopping 1,500 eggs a day.At Sangvi, Shriram Pawar operates a food truck which offers 111 egg dishes from evening to midnight. The 34-year-old, who spent a year in a similar business in Surat, claims to be the only one in Maharashtra to offer the intriguingly-named egg pomfret. Well, this dish is basically an omelette fried adequately to earn a texture like the skin of a fish. The omelette is then folded and shaped like a pomfret. It is stuffed with chopped cooked egg whites and cheese before being dunked into a plateful of tomato-based gravy.Pawar, who uses around 200 eggs per day, says each of his myriad dishes has a unique taste. An exhaustive menu like his would be found in many places in Gujarat, he points out. There, eggs have an acceptability factor among the largely vegetarian population, even though they may not be eaten at home."

Hira Singh Vegetable Wholesale Market, locally known as Azadpur mandi, said prices of tomatoes, onions, and potatoes had increased.Disruption in supplyThe vendors said potato stock was influenced the least and the price of onions rose only slightly. However, tomato sellers complained of disruption in supply.Subhas Seti, a tomato vendor for the past 47 years, said while 70 vehicles is the norm, only 12 made deliveries on June 2, the second day of the protest. Other wholesalers had similar experiences.Dashrat Kumar, a vendor at Azadpur mandi for the past 12 years, said the supply of tomatoes was considerably low on June 2. He said the price of tomatoes almost doubled when only five of the usual 50 trucks of produce arrived.Anil Kumar, a tomato seller since 1990, sold his stock for Rs. 15 per kg, Rs. 5 higher than last week, because only four of a total of 40 supply trucks were on duty. When asked about the reason for such few trucks, he said the drivers were worried about local agitation and damage to their vehicles in transit.Vendors sympathiseDespite the disruption in vegetable supplies, many vendors at Azadpur mandi sympathised with the farmers.Although Mohammed Javed, a potato vendor, reported an approximate 10% reduction in stock, he said, The farmers are not getting enough money so it is natural that they will be upset and want to strike.While potato prices have not fluctuated significantly, those working with commission agents, like Javed, have suffered losses. The commission agents responded to the strike by increasing their rate of commission by about Rs. 4 per kg, added Javed and other potato sellers at Azadpur mandi. However, many vegetable retailers in the city did not report any significant price fluctuations. Dinesh Kumar, a retailer in Razapur, said, As of now, there is no change in the rate of tomatoes and onions.Asked about what the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) in Delhi was doing to ameliorate the situation, APMC chairperson Adil Ahmad Khan said, What will the APMC do?

I hope that is the correct spelling of achhe and its not achhoo as my autocorrect is suggesting. My father says the right spelling is chee but I think he is editorialising.So wherever you are, whoever you are, extend both your arms  dont feel shy, this is a time to celebrate  and pat yourselves on the back. If you cant reach your own back because you are too fat, do it using your social media handle, or the handle of your trishul. But do it for sure  because you deserve it.A ridiculous notionYou silly goose! Deserve it my foot! I was just joking, to see how seriously you take me. And you all are really patting yourselves on the back?! This has to be the height of self-delusion. Do you people really believe the credit for all that India has achieved in the last four years goes to each one of you? I am asking a genuine question here and I want a genuine answer: are all of you megalomaniacs? Did you really think each of you is collectively responsible for the progress of this great nation? I am shocked to hear that you would entertain even for one second such a ridiculous, blasphemous notion. Never forget that all the good things happening in our country right now is because of one man  and we all know who that is.What makes me really sad is that all of you got four years  four entire years  to fulfil every one of our beloved Prime Ministers dreams. And yet, you have let him down so badly. Each one of you. True, the Indian economy is still growing at 12.7% per annum, we are still creating 4.2 crore jobs every year, and farmers are so happy that they are giving away milk and tomatoes for free. It is also true that we have eliminated corruption through demonetisation, achieved 200% tax compliance through GST, and deposited Rs. 15 lakh in the bank account of every Indian who worked in the IT Cell for a minimum of 56 days.Nor can anyone deny that today, white people in different parts of the world look at brown Indians with more respect than ever before. Foreigners are so much in awe of our Prime Minister that when they translate his speeches they add five extra paragraphs free of charge. After 60 years of Dark Ages under the Congress, today every Indian village has woken up to light and Paytm.Four great featsIn fact, Modiji routinely achieves in any given week 100 times more than what Nehru accomplished from 1947 to 2014. But the pseudo-sickular Indian media that has sold out to the hate-Modi industry simply wont show them to the Indian public. If you think I am being too harsh, Ill give you just four examples of Modijis historic achievements, all from the last one week, which have been completely blacked out by the paid-cum-stung media.Im betting you didnt know, for instance, that for the first time in Indias 30,000-year-history, an orchid was named after an Indian Prime Minister when the Singapore government decided to name a beautiful Indic orchid that produces upright inflorescences up to 56 inches long, Dendrobrium Narendra Modi. Or that Modiji became the first Indian Prime Minister to visit a Mariamman temple in Singapore. Were you aware that the IAEA has hailed the achievement of electrifying all Indian villages as the greatest event in the history of every energy, including physical, kinetic, potential, sexual, and weed energy? Or that for the first time in Indias history, an Indian Prime Minister purchased a Madhubani painting in Singapore using a RuPay card? Do you know how many Madhubani paintings Nehru bought using a RuPay card, either in India or in Singapore? Zero. Thats right. If Modiji and Nehru were to settle things between them through a tennis match, Modiji would win by an innings and 545 runs.The one thing we couldnt doThats the kind of Prime Minister weve been blessed with the last four years  someone who not only works 23 hours a day but never boasts about it in his own words. In return, he had only one small request for all of us: a Congress-mukt Bharat. And Im sorry to say, as a nation, we have failed miserably in this.As the Karnataka elections and the recent bypoll results showed, not only is India far from being Congress-mukt, the entire Opposition is ganging up against one man. And you all are sitting quietly and watching like Gandhijis monkeys? After all that he has done for you, if you cant even ensure another five years of Achhe Din in 2019, I must say you are not fit to remain in this country. I suggest you pack off to Pakistan and while you are there, dont forget to watch Veeradi Veera Wedding with your jihadi grandmother."

Sunil Kumar, have been packed in the panchayats by women beneficiaries of Kudumbasree units under the strict quality supervision of the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK).

Each packet would contain a minimum of five varieties of vegetable seeds. We are making the seed sourcing and processing facility a permanent mechanism to help the State achieve vegetable self-sufficiency. Quality seeds would be supplied to all the needy, including farmers, schools, institutions, households and NGOs, said Thomas Cheriyan, manager of the processing plant of the VFPCK at Alathur here.The agency, which completed 21 years this month, will soon start a Statewide campaign promoting organic vegetable cultivation. Talking to The Hindu , Thomas Cherian said the State needs quality seeds and seedlings to achieve self-sufficiency in cultivation of pesticide-free vegetables.50% deficitThe State now faces a 50% deficit in its vegetable requirements. We are attempting to bridge the gap, he said.The packing of seeds for distribution among students has been conducted using the services of 2,000 women volunteers of Kudumbasree. All the 13 seed-packing centres in the region would be converted into permanent entities.Ensuring supplyApart from seeds, the VFPCK would ensure the supply of vermicompost, coir pith compost, powdered cow dung, cow urine, panchagavya, fish amino acid, EM solution, neem cakes, bone meal, grow bag, and seedling trays to vegetable growers.600 tonnes of seedIn its 21 years of existence, the council has generated and supplied around 600 tonnes of seeds from the Alathur unit.It has also ensured Palakkad the prime position on the vegetable cultivation map of Kerala."

This used to be a one-and-done ordeal... However, with Ghostbusters , Hollywood took a big swing on a female-led project, and didnt overreact to its failure, he wrote.The premise of What Women Want (2000)  Mel Gibson as a marketing executive who is suddenly able to hear womens thoughts  lends itself more obviously to a gender-flipped remake than most.Taraji P. Henson, who does the honours in What Men Want (2019), said her role was an empowering statement for women, but also a learning experience.You kind of just brush it off as men like sex, eating and farting. I was like, How are they going to make this interesting? said the Empire and Hidden Figures star. But then I read the script and Im like, Wow, men are really insecure about their looks, just like women! I think thats going to be great, for women to see that.Ensemble of womenSome Hollywood watchers have argued that while female-flipping may seem progressive, in reality it militates against those really fighting pay inequality, harassment and other forms of sexism.Even though I can get excited for a movie like Oceans 8 ... at the end of the day it still seems to signify that womens movies still need some sort of male appeal to get made, said Hazel Cills of female-focused pop culture website Jezebel.A gender-swapped movie implies that women arent important enough to get their own, original stories, and thus must piggy-back on franchises helmed by men that have already proven to be successful.It was an issue that came up when Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett and the rest of the Oceans 8 cast hosted a news conference at New Yorks Metropolitan Museum of Art earlier this month.Ms. Bullock admitted that initially she honestly didnt think it would work, or get made while Ms. Blanchett agreed that, a few short years ago, such a project would have been out of the question."

Orders are placed online, priced at 32 per person, from a choice of four curries, a vegetarian side dish and naan.Since Sake Dean Mohamed from Patna opened Londons first Indian restaurant called Hindoostane Coffee House in Marylebone in 1810, the Indian food industry has grown exponentially and is worth 4 billion today.It is a different matter that curry in Britain stands for dishes vastly different from what they are known as back home, and at least one Indian dish is a purely British invention: chicken tikka masala or CTM, endowed with the status of national dish by former foreign secretary Robin Cook.CTM, no surprise,is one of the four curries on offer, the others being Lamb Balti, Bangal Naga Chicken and Paneer Korai (veg). The food will be flown to Bordeaux Saucats Airfield, located in the heart of the Pessac-Lognan wine region, where it will be served to customers.James Emery, a France-based British aviation trainer who thought of the idea with Faz Ahmed of Akash, told The Times: Indian food in France is standardised for French tastes and Ive never had anything that resembles what you get in an Indian takeaway in Britain.Its a bit of a hare-brained scheme but we love flying and we love curries and we thought it would get the year off to a good start.

The food will be flown to Bordeaux in a Diamond DA42 aircraft operated by Iroise Aro Formation, a flying school in France.The CTM is also proving a major export item from Britain to France. Retailer Marks & Spencer has been reportedly selling ready-to-eat CTM meals at its outlets in Paris by the thousands, making the dish its top selling meal there.CTM may have Indian origins butis reputed to have been invented in 1971 by a cook in Glasgow after a customer complained that his chicken dish was dry.

5b208fd09855b768c2e029dc,Seed swap  a growing trend among green thumbs,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/seed-swap-a-growing-trend-among-green-thumbs/article24131936.ece,2018-06-11,,The Hindu,"Sharing food, or even ingredients, is common. Now, however, the growing number of people who share a passion for growing their own food also share an essential component of what they produce: the seeds.Right from virtual connection on social media to physically meeting, residents of the city are slowly but surely warming up to the idea of seed sharing.This exercise not only ensures higher germination rates and less dependence on commercial sellers, but also gives novices in the field a chance to learn first-hand from the experienced on how to go green and organic, they say.Good responseAfter organising its first Seed Swap in 2017, the Backyard Factory is back with another swapping event this month. The first seed swap event was well appreciated. We had posted information about the event on Facebook and a good number of people turned up for the event at Cubbon Park. The idea was to let people bring excess seeds from their produce and share them with people who are interested in growing their own food. It was a mutual exchange. What was surprising was most of the participants were young gardening enthusiasts, said Lincy Inder, who conducts kitchen gardening workshops for schoolchildren.This time, the event will be held on June 30 at Cubbon Park, and Ms. Inder expects even better participation than the last time.While meetings are very essential for seed sharing, another group also makes good use of social media to share seeds with the community. Members of Grow Your Own Food, a Facebook community, put up details of excess seeds available with them on social media. Others can contact the group if interested. The members meet once in two months for a seed swapping event at Lalbagh.Whatever we grow, we save the seeds for ourself and to share with others, said Suresh Rao, a member of the group.Mr. Rao said the best thing about seed sharing is that there is 100% guarantee of the seeds germinating. It is not the case with store-bought seeds. We usually share tomato, brinjal, gourd, and all types of greens during the meets, he said. The group also promotes heirloom seeds by sharing them.Explaining how the members store the excess seeds for sharing, he said, It is quite easy. From two tomatoes, 100 seeds can be obtained, which can be saved for the next season. One brinjal has around 200 seeds. Though the seed saving technique for each variety differs, it is not rocket science. During the meet-ups, we share the concepts with newcomers, Mr. Rao said.Another city-based group, Oota From Your Thota, which encourages people to grow their food organically, also organises seed swaps among members regularly.A common practiceWhile urban gardeners are just getting used to the idea of seed sharing, the practice is common among farmers, said Hemanth, farmer and member of the Facebook group Bangalore Gardening. In our farming community, seed sharing has always been a common practice. It helps reduce farmers dependence on commercially sold seeds and saves a lot of money, he says.The Horticulture Department too gives away seedlings instead of just seeds to anyone interested. After monsoon, we distribute the excess seedlings to interested people for free. Most are tree seedlings. In a year, at least 5,000 seedlings are given away, said M.R. Chandrashekar, Deputy Director, Lalbagh."

That separation is not a disease of colored people. It is a disease of white people. I do not intend to be quiet about it,"" he said during a commencement speech at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania.As a Jewish scientist who experienced anti-Semitism in Germany, Einstein showed deep sympathy for black people in America. He wandered around black neighborhoods in segregated Princeton, New Jersey, his home after leaving Germany amid the rise of the Nazis, sat on people's porches, chatted with them, and handed out candies to their children and grandchildren. He had become so entrenched in America's civil rights movement that the FBI placed him under surveillance, collecting nearly 1,500 pages of documents on Einstein by the time he died.But there's another side to Einstein that perhaps people did not know then.One of the travel diaries he wrote during a months-long voyage in the 1920s reveals that in his private moments, the Nobel-winning physicist portrayed people of other races, such as Chinese and Indians, in a stereotypical, dehumanizing way. Einstein's unfiltered musings about the people he saw and interacted with during his journey show that even the civil rights icon and ""paragon"" of humanitarianism harbored racist thoughts about those who did not look like him, said Ze'ev Rosenkranz, senior editor and assistant director of the Einstein Papers Project at the California Institute of Technology.""In published statements, he's usually in favor of civil and human rights and was socially progressive. I'm not saying that he didn't believe in those things,"" Rosenkranz said, but he added that the words Einstein never intended to be published are in stark contrast with his more-guarded public statements.That contradiction makes Einstein all the more human, said Rosenkranz, who edited ""The Travel Diaries of Albert Einstein,"" published recently by Princeton University Press.""I'm not apologizing for him or anything . . . I still feel that the unpleasant remarks are quite shocking, but they do reveal that we all have this darker side to our attitudes and prejudices,"" he said.Einstein wrote the travel diary from October 1922 to March 1923, when he and wife Elsa traveled by ship to the Mediterranean, Sri Lanka, China and Japan. He wrote every day about his surroundings, at times writing as if he was in a hurry. ""Radiant day. Sea quiet, almost windless,"" he wrote Oct. 12, 1922. Other times, he is more detailed: ""In the evening, wonderful sunset - purple with finely illuminated narrow wind-swept clouds,"" he wrote on the same day.He also chronicled his observations of people he saw and met, summing up ""their personalities and idiosyncrasies in just a few, often humorous or irreverent, words,"" Rosenkranz wrote in the introduction portion of the travel diary.The average Japanese, Einstein wrote, is ""unproblematic, impersonal, he cheerfully fulfills the social function which befalls him without pretension, but proud of his community and nation. Forsaking his traditional ways in favor of European ones does not undermine his national pride.""While Einstein used male pronouns for deeper reflections about the Japanese, his thoughts about women were more about their physical appearance than their personality. Japanese women, he wrote as he observed them on the ship, ""look ornate and bewildered . . . Black-eyed, black-haired, large-headed, scurrying.""His reflections about the Chinese, with whom he spent far less time, were more callous, even insulting. Though he called the Chinese ""industrious,"" he also described them as ""filthy"" and ""obtuse."" They're a ""peculiar herd-like nation,"" Einstein wrote, ""often more like automatons than people."" He saw them as intellectually inferior, quoting - instead of challenging - Portuguese teachers he met during his travels who claimed that the Chinese ""are incapable of being trained to think logically"" and ""have no talent for mathematics.""There was, as Rosenkranz described, a ""healthy dose of extreme misogyny"":""I noticed how little difference there is between men and women; I don't understand what kind of fatal attraction Chinese women possess which enthralls the corresponding men to such an extent that they are incapable of defending themselves against the formidable blessing of offspring.""His reflections in the few days he spent in China also reveal Einstein's tendency to perceive foreigners as a threat.""It would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all other races,"" he wrote. ""For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary.""In Colombo, Sri Lanka, he wrote with empathy about the beggars on the streets. He was ""very much ashamed"" for his complicity in such ""despicable treatment of human beings,"" he said. But he also was critical of them for being poor. He saw them as inferior people who ""live in great filth and considerable stench.""The Indians and Sinhalese in Colombo, Einstein said, ""do little"" and ""need little.""As he traveled in the Levant in the Mediterranean, he described Levantines as a ""screaming and gesticulating"" group of people ""of every shade."" Levantine merchants swarmed the ship, Einstein wrote, transforming the upper deck into a bazaar. He found them both repulsive and beautiful, describing them as ""bandit-like"" and ""filthy,"" but also ""handsome and graceful to look at.""About a decade after his travels, in December 1932, Einstein and his wife left Germany for a three-month trip to the United States. Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party took over the German government the following month. Einstein didn't return home and stayed in the United States, where he became more aware of the plight of African Americans. He entrenched himself in the civil rights movement, signed anti-lynching petitions and volunteered to testify as a character witness in the trial of writer and philosopher W.E.B. Du Bois.""It would be easy to say, yes, he became more enlightened,"" Rosenkranz said. But whether Einstein's racist views, particularly about the Chinese, had changed, Rosenkranz is not sure.All of this is to say that our understanding of Einstein misses his complexity as a human being, Rosenkranz said.""One should emphasize the different elements and contradictory elements in the statements that he made and in his personality,"" Rosenkranz said. ""On one hand, he was very generous and very favorable . . . But there's also these statements that one should not ignore."" What this says about human nature is that we are complex beings with both enlightened and dark beliefs, Rosenkranz said. ""We generally don't express them, but we might harbor them secretly. This gives us the opportunity to look at ourselves."""
5b223f849855b7429b3172cf,"Beef, Fried Rice, Potatoes: The Diplomatic Meaning Of The Trump-Kim Lunch",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/beef-fried-rice-potatoes-the-diplomatic-meaning-of-the-trump-kim-lunch-1867213,2018-06-14,,NDTV,"Images of the lunch shows pre-plated starters on a rectangular table lined down the center. (File)The summit lunch, which brought together 13 principals from both delegations was ""a little unexpected,"" given the early stage of the talks between the two world leaders. (Reuters)The lunch menu for the historic summit involving President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the opulent Capella resort in Singapore suggests both sides got what they wanted from Tuesday's sit-down: concessions, in the form of dishes designed to appeal to both a meat-loving American and a North Korean with more international tastes.The menu should have come with pencils for circling choices. Beneath each course were three oh-so-diplomatic options. Starters featured a prawn cocktail served with avocado salad , a steakhouse staple POTUS would probably be reassured to see; Korean stuffed cucumbers; and green mango kerabu with honey-lime dressing and fresh octopus. Kerabu, a staple of Malay cuisine, is a refreshing salad judged by the balance of sweet, sour, salty and hot notes in the dressing.BBC News reported that the stuffed cucumbers, or oiseon, caused some raised eyebrows among Koreans, given the dish's royal origins. ""It's a bit like the British prime minister sitting down to dine with a visiting dignitary and chowing down on a roasted swan - a favourite of Henry VIII,"" the news outlet declared.Wherever Trump and Asian leaders meet, beef is sure to be in the picture. Over a round of golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last November, hamburgers were served. On a trip to China last year, Trump's hosts seemed to be appealing to his affection for steak with ketchup when he was offered ""stewed beef steak in tomato sauce.""Sure enough, beef, as in short rib confit, was one of three main course selections. The entree was rounded out with steamed broccolini (doctor's orders, maybe, since Trump is said to be dieting?) and potato dauphinois, a fancier way to say potatoes au gratin, a Trump favorite. Both leaders can get around spuds. Kim, who as a teenager studied abroad in Switzerland, is said to have developed a fondness for rosti, the country's famous potato pancakes.In deference to Trump, a teetotaler, the beef's red wine sauce was listed as ""on the side."" (Kim, who has retained both Japanese sushi and Italian pizza makers, reportedly has a fondness for fine French wines.)The alternate entrees were soy-braised cod with Asian vegetables and sweet-and-sour pork with Yangzhou fried rice flavored with XO chile sauce. Was the fried rice a sly way to find a spot for China, North Korea's largest trading partner, at the table? Kim arrived in the city/state aboard a Boeing 747 operated by Air China. Multiple news sources said he brought along some of his own food and even a toilet.Dessert - the course with the power to leave a last impression - was decidedly Western. Choices included a dark chocolate tartlet; the cream- or custard-filled brioche called Tropezienne; and vanilla ice cream with cherry coulis. The scoops came from Haagen-Dazs, the only designer label flagged on the menu. Presumably, Trump didn't get his preferred double helping of ice cream.Video of guests gathering for the lunch shows pre-plated starters on a rectangular table lined down the center with soothing green- and cream-colored flowers. While Singapore was the facilitating host, Trump appeared to take command, asking photographers: ""Getting a good picture everybody? So we look nice and handsome and thin? Perfect.""Getting to ""perfect,"" or close to it, involves teams from both sides identifying the preferences and steering clear of the dislikes of the principals, says Peter Selfridge, who served as U.S. chief of protocol during the last three years of the Obama administration. Reached for comment, the former ambassador said via email, ""At first glance, it looks like rather than having to decide on one main dish that would appease both [palates] - a difficult task under normal conditions - they chose to offer something for everyone, while also giving a nod to the flavors of the host country."" Selfridge called the summit lunch, which brought together 13 principals from both delegations, ""a little unexpected,"" given the early stage of the talks between the two world leaders. Then again, he said, ""sharing a meal goes a long way to breaking the ice."""

This led to tension at some places.The protesting farmers continued to dump agricultural produce and milk in vegetable markets and on roads to show their protest, while in some villages and towns, they set up temporary stalls to sell the vegetables at throwaway prices.Vegetable prices soarIts impact at vegetable markets was visible as prices surged in absence of adequate supply.In the past couple of days, prices of some veggies  especially green vegetables  have gone up. Tomato prices have increased from Rs 10 per kg a week ago to Rs 20-25, said a seller at Sector 26 in Chandigarh.

However, it lost steam after few days as the bid of farmer organisations to block transport of milk and other essential items to cities was thwarted by police.Bharatiya Kisan Union Madhya Pradesh general secretary Anil Yadav admitted the impact of the strike was not as expected in MP, and blamed the fear of the police for its failure. The farmers do not want to get into the wrong books of police. Thousands have been forced to sign bonds of ?25,000 and BJP workers among the farmers and members of the RSS-backed Bharatiya Kisan Sangh were active in sabotaging the strike, he said.Yadav said to make the bandh a total success there will be a Bharat Bandh on June 10 in which there will be no movement of any goods from villages to towns. Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh president Shiv Kumar Sharma said they will work to make the June 10 bandh a success. We have given call for a Bharat Bandh and asked all those living in 6 lakh villages of the country not to supply anything in the towns. We have also requested traders to keep their shops closed till 2pm in our support, he said.Sharma said the biggest achievement of the strike was that despite provocation from the administration, the movement was peaceful. They threatened farmers, made them sign bonds, and were looking for an excuse to give this movement a bad name, but failed, he said, adding the impact was not as successful as expected.In a bid to support the call, the Congress in Gujarat announced its support for ongoing farmer protest seeking farm loan waiver, saying the Vijay Rupani government was in its three-day annual chintan shivir (brainstorming session) in Vadodara, and was not thinking about farm distress. The BJP government holds agricultural festival every year but, in reality, it has not addressed the real issues concerning farmers. Be it the right prices or expansion of irrigation network, the government has failed on all fronts, said Leader of Opposition Paresh Dhanani.On the first day of the Congress-backed agitation, farmers threw vegetables and spilled milk on roads, mostly in Saurashtra, central and north Gujarat. In Keshod town of Junagadh district, the party observed a day-long bandh. On last day (Sunday) of the drive, there will be dharnas and hunger strike, Dhanani added.In UPs Amroha, farmers threw tomatoes on road as part of the agitation and announced that they will not allow movement of any goods on June 10."

Police reached the spot and the milkmen had to take another route to reach the city. The two groups entered into a scuffle.Similar scenes were witnessed at Rampura Phul and on the Bathinda- Muktsar road where milkmen resorted to protest by raising slogans against them being stopped from selling their produce.Activists of the BKU (Ekta Sidhupur) had set up nakas at Jodhpur Romana near Bibiwala village on the Bathinda-Talwandi Sabo road, the Bathinda  Goniana road and on the Bathinda-Malout road.Sohan Singh, the state president of the Milkmen Union, said that they had told the farmer unions before the start of the strike that any milkmen who want to support them are free do so by not supplying milk to the city areas but no milkman should be forced to stop the supply.He said that it is not possible for the majority of the milkmen not to supply milk for 10 days.In Sangrur district also, farmers set up check-points at different places and stopped vegetable growers and dairy owners from carrying their produce to the city areas on Saturday night and on Sunday morning. Dairy owners dumped milk on the roads at Bhawanigarh, alleging that farmer unions were harassing them and milkmen. They said the activists should instead hold protests outside big milk plants.The BKU leadership, however, claimed that milkman unions are supporting their agitation. Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of a faction of BKU, said he was working to make this protest peaceful. We are getting expected response, he said.At Phagwara, a group of farmers laid siege outside the local vegetable market and did not allow trucks or tractor-trolleys carry farm produce to enter inside.A group of farmers created ruckus at the new vegetable market by forcing commission agents to shut their shops and not allowing them to sell their stock of vegetables and fruits. Police force was deployed to avoid any untoward incident.Veggie prices continue to soarPrices of various vegetables have doubled or trebled since the strike started two days back.Varinder Kumar, a vegetable seller in Jalandhar, said they are somehow managing to get vegetables from farmers or from the old stocks at mandis at double or triple rates.Tomato, which was being sold at 10 per kg three days ago, is now 30 per kg while prices of peas, brinjal, cabbage, cauliflower and other vegetables have also gone up.Not much effect in MajhaIn Majha belt, the plan to suspend the supplies of vegetables and milk failed to elicit much response as essential commodities were available in the market as usual.The Kisan Sangarsh Committee has refused to support the protest.Its Punjab convener, Kawalpreet Singh Pannu, said they will not support the protest that affects the common man."

Well, he isnt either. For someone who grew up helping his father cultivate wheat and paddy on their 50-acre farm, Satpals transformation into a progressive entrepreneur is remarkable.I made the switch from the wheat-paddy crop cycle in 2014 for better returns. Traditional farming got me Rs 50,000 an acre a year. That works out to be Rs 25-Rs 30 lakh a year, he says as he shows around his six-acre net house farm.Crops are sown in a controlled environment in a net house. Its a farm technique pioneered by Israel and has worked wonders. Satpal says growing cucumber, capsicum and tomato in his six-acre net house fetches him Rs 48-Rs 50 lakh a year. I have given the rest of my land on contract to other farmers so I earn from there also, he says.He among farmers in the state who have benefited from the Centre of Excellence (CoE) for Vegetables at Gharaunda in Karnal, an Indo-Israel project to impart technical knowhow, training and quality seedlings to farmers.Haryana has set up four CoEs under the Indo-Israel partnership, while a floriculture centre is coming up at Sondhi in Jhajjar.Horticulture director Arjun Saini says though the practice of protected cultivation was known, the intervention of Israeli experts helped improve cultivation practices. They taught them how to provide seedlings in a soil-less medium in a green house; the use of drip irrigation; nutrient management; the use of thermal nets; pollination of vegetables inside poly houses; branching and wiring of plants. It improved cultivation in poly/net house in view of the extreme weather conditions, says Saini.Catalysts of change Centre of Excellence for Vegetables, Gharaunda, KarnalEstablished in 2011 to demonstrate latest technology of vegetable cultivation in protected and open conditions. Imparts quality vegetable seedlings and practical training to farmers for protected cultivation.Centre of Excellence for Fruits, Mangiana, SirsaSet up in 2013 to demonstrate the latest technologies of fruits cultivation with different spacing, on flat and raised beds and varietal trials. Crops demonstrated include citrus varieties, olives, pomegranate, date palm varieties, guava and bael.Centre for Sub Tropical Fruits, Ladwa, KurukshetraEstablished in 2016 to demonstrate advanced technologies of horticulture to increase farm income. Crops demonstrated include mango, litchi, guava, peach, plum, olives and pomegranate.Integrated Beekeeping Development Centre, Ramnagar, KurukshetraSet up in 2017, the aim is to demonstrate advanced technologies of beekeeping, bee venom, bee propolis and other byproducts to increase farm income.Floriculture centre, Sondhi, JhajjarApproved. The objective is to demonstrate flower cultivation technologies and production of quality planting material.Satpal says he gets updates from the CoE on new varieties of seedlings and techniques.When I was growing wheat and paddy, I couldnt think of buying a vehicle. Net house farming has given me financial flexibility, he says. Satpal is now setting up a mushroom production unit next to the net house. It will cost me Rs 12 lakh as Ill get Rs 8 lakh as subsidy under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, he says. His elder son, a BTech degree holder, is studying mushroom production to run the project. My second son is studying law. I couldnt have paid for their education had I not made the switch, Satpal adds.Horticulture hubTaking a cue from his friend who grew strawberries, Arun Chauhan, 50, quit his engineering job in 1998 to return to Manouli village and start farming. For years, his family grew wheat and paddy on 30 acres, earning Rs 30,000-Rs 40,000 per acre.Chauhan wanted to do something different. He saw residents of neighbouring Aterna village grow baby corn. A private company guiding farmers there suggested he grow sweet corn. He started with a small chunk. After two years, our produce surpassed expectations, he says. This inspired others. Today my village is called the sweet corn village as every second farmer here grows it. The cost of sowing sweet corn is Rs 20,000 per acre but the returns are from Rs 1 lakh-Rs 2 lakh per acre, he says.Chauhan learned poly house farming from the CoE at Gharaunda in 2008. He set up a poly house on an acre and has now increased it to six acres. The money I get from six acres is four times higher than what I get from the 24 acres I own. I started growing lilies in the poly house and have since shifted to cherry tomatoes and seedless cucumbers. For two years, Im growing red, yellow and green bell peppers, he adds.Chauhan says a poly house set up in an acre gives him 250-300 quintals of bell peppers, which sells for Rs 10-15 lakh. The best is I dont have to go anywhere. Brands such as Dominos and Reliance Fresh come to my village and collect the vegetables, he says. Ive started growing muskmelon after CoE experts suggested a high-yield method. To maintain the poly house, the CoE has suggested we do soil solarisation by mulching and fumigation, he adds.Purchasing powerManchuri resident Surjit Singh is among those who has benefited from the CoE for vegetables. He says net house farming increased his per acre earning from Rs 6 lakh to Rs 8 lakh.I started net house farming on two acres in 2013. Gradually, I increased it to six acres, Singh said. He started growing cucumber, tomato and capsicum and says he has never faced losses despite fluctuating prices.For Surjit and his elder brother, Inderjit, who own 35 acres, life has changed in five years. Their purchasing power has increased and they no longer worry about crop loss and rising input costs. Income from six acres of net house farming is more than the 29 acres under traditional crops, he says. Many farmers have drawn inspiration from our experience and seek our help, he adds.Sandeep Kumar, 36, of Mohindipur in Karnal has also seen his income increase in two years ever since he adopted net-house farming.Sandeep, who shifted from Delhi to Karnal after his land was acquired by the government, says, Initially, I entered into the real estate business but it turned non-profitable in 2014 and I turned to growing vegetables.

Earlier, his Madhya Pradesh counterpart claimed no farmers are participating in the strike. Farmers are happy with the schemes.Farmer organisations called for a 10-day Gaon Bandh (rural shutdown) from June 1 demanding loan waivers, land reforms and higher prices for their produce. The agitation, which the organisers say will end with a nationwide shutdown on its tenth day, has brought back focus on an agrarian crisis that could, unless addressed, hurt the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) politically in elections to key states later this year and the national elections in 2019.Traders in the Chandigarh fruit and vegetable market said the prices of several vegetables such as tomatoes, potatoes, capsicum and bottle gourd had increased by Rs 10-20 a kilo.Traders in some markets in Madhya Pradesh also reported a spike in prices. There is a 30-40% drop in supplies since yesterday. Today, the wholesale prices were up by about 20%, said Amit Patidar, a trader at Neemuch fruit and vegetable market.At a few places in Madhya Pradesh, farmers put up blockades. In Petlawad town in tribal Jhabua district, farmers distributed milk and vegetables free to patients in the hospitals , refusing to sell both.Resentment among farmers is particularly strong in Madhya Pradesh  a BJP-ruled state that is among a clutch of others set for elections this winter  and Congress president Rahul Gandhi is expected to visit Mandsaur in the state, where five farmers were killed last year on June 6, while taking part in demonstrations.Anil Yadav, the union general secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union, one of the organisations coordinating the agitation, said the campaign will be amplified from next week.In Punjab, where chief minister Amarinder Singh blamed the Centre for the farm crisis, farmers protested at several places such as Nabha, Ludhiana, Muktsar, Tarn Taran, Nangal and Ferozepur and blocked supply of vegetables and milk entering cities.According to the Punjab police, farmers allegedly forced the closure of vegetable mandi in Ferozpur and in Bathinda, farmers owing allegiance to Bhartiya Kisan Union stopped some vehicles carrying milk. Some farmers were taken into custody, said Bathinda police station officer Iqbal Singh.In Haryana, milk supply to Haryana Dairy Development Co-operative Federation Ltd was blocked in several districts. In Sirsa, police booked about 90 unidentified persons for allegedly trying to stop sale of milk and vegetables in their village. In Hisar, Fatehabad and Sirsa where the farmers held protest early morning and did not allow any vegetable seller to reach at the city.In Maharashtra, the Rashtriya Kisaan Mahasangh (RKM) stopped supplies of vegetables, fruits and mils to cities such as Mumbai, Pune and Nashik. The Mahasangh also announced it would intensify the agitation by increasing the number of traffic blockades from June 7.The decision to stop supplies starting from June 1 till June 10 was taken by the farmers under the banner of Kisan Ekta Manch and Rashtriya Kisan Maha Sangh.(With agency inputs)"

Minor incidents of scuffle between farmers and traders were also reported from Bikaner and Sriganganagar.Cooperative dairies were reluctant to procure milk because of the ongoing protest. Jaipur Dairy chairman Om Prakash Punia has written to chief secretary DB Gupta, requesting him to ensure adequate security for milk tankers.On Saturday, farmers spilled milk on roads in Jaipur rural areas.

You can have them scrambled, boiled, curried, poached, baked, basted, fried sunny side up and even whisked raw in coffee. Additionally, they play the role of binder, thickener, emulsifier and vitalizer. Want to give definition and bounce to your hair? Simply slap an egg on your scalp!As a protein source, eggs are a delight for both weight-watchers and those building muscle. But none desires eggs more than the hungry soul who is either low on budget or shorn of a wholesome eating option late at night.Shabbir Shaikh comes to the rescue here. The 39-year-old has been running a handcart selling egg dishes outside the Shivajinagar railway station for the past 20 years. He conducts business till 3am, moving his cart into a nondescript lane adjoining the station after midnight.On an average, Shaikh uses 300 eggs daily but sticks to just three dishes  bhurji, omelette and half fry (renamed palti if flipped over). Each dish, which comes with four pavs, is priced at Rs 50 till midnight and Rs 60 thereafter. Interestingly, Shaikh says rail and bus passengers are not his chief clientele  word of mouth about his food draws in regular customers from as far as Pimpri and Hinjewadi.Like Shaikh, most stalls and handcarts in the city restrict their egg menu to not more than four or five dishes. Yash Pawar, owner of Pune Egg Cafe on Senapati Bapat Road, says this is very unlike Gujarat, especially Surat and Vadodara, where stalls have around 25-30 different egg dishes on their list.The 24-year-old Pawar, who grew up in Vadodara and came here to study at Symbiosis, has more than 50 egg items on his menu, with the average pricing being Rs 100. He says his chef, who is from Vadodara, can rustle up 300 types of egg dishes. Pawar offers eggs in rice, gravies and parathas, and as starters or omelettes. His trademark dishes are the ghotala (of Surat fame), boiled egg tikka masala and egg-kheema rice. And, yes, the place satisfies late-night food cravings.Pawar says he uses only Amul butter for his dishes. So does Dnyaneshwar Narvankar, the franchise owner of the newly-started eggs-only Raju Omlet at Vimannagar. Now, the Omlet is no typo; it has been retained in the name boards of all 12 outlets of the brand  six of them in Gujarat and one each in Mumbai, Pune, Dubai, Sharjah, Pattaya and the US.All outlets have a fixed menu of 13 dishes, and each dish uses 50 gms of butter. The dishes are priced up to Rs 170, and the best-sellers are the green boiled egg tikka and the crush omelette. Narvankar says the outlets do not believe in experimenting with too many dishes, though he points out that one can find more than 1,000 egg recipes across Gujarat. The Vadodara outlet, from where the business started, uses a whopping 1,500 eggs a day.At Sangvi, Shriram Pawar operates a food truck which offers 111 egg dishes from evening to midnight. The 34-year-old, who spent a year in a similar business in Surat, claims to be the only one in Maharashtra to offer the intriguingly-named egg pomfret. Well, this dish is basically an omelette fried adequately to earn a texture like the skin of a fish. The omelette is then folded and shaped like a pomfret. It is stuffed with chopped cooked egg whites and cheese before being dunked into a plateful of tomato-based gravy.Pawar, who uses around 200 eggs per day, says each of his myriad dishes has a unique taste. An exhaustive menu like his would be found in many places in Gujarat, he points out. There, eggs have an acceptability factor among the largely vegetarian population, even though they may not be eaten at home."

About 28 traders did not participate in the first phase of the process that took place on Tuesday.Acknowledging that the reception among existing traders to relocate their business to the Kallikudi integrated market complex was overwhelming, officials said that around 272 wholesale traders would be moved to the ground floor of the new 9.79 acre facility. Subsequently, in the second phase, the department in coordination with the district administration eyes to relocate another 100 traders from the Gandhi market.We have initiated the process to allot shop numbers and respective blocks to the traders whose applications were selected based on suggestions and inspections by the scrutiny committee that includes city corporation. The response to relocate was good particularly among the English and country vegetables traders, an official with the agriculture marketing department told TOI.The allotment process saw the 272 traders allocated with a shop each across selective blocks of the total 19 blocks in the integrated market. Subsequently, the traders provided with shops through randomisation will be asked to make an agreement with the marketing department to rent the shops for one year tenure.The registration process for identified traders allotted with shops will conclude by June 15 (Friday). Simultaneously, we will take measures to hand over keys to the respective traders, the official added. The stakeholders have asserted that full-fledged relocation of 300 wholesale traders from Gandhi market to integrated market would be initiated after June 15. When the district administration insists us to relocate the shops we have no other go.

The current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops.Sugarcane farmers in Uttar Pradesh are owed over Rs 8,300 crore for the crop they have supplied to mills this crushing season at the state governments advised price (SAP). Maharashtras cane growers had similar unpaid dues of Rs 2,213 crore as on March 31, that too, against the Centres lower mandated fair and remunerative price (FRP). Yet, cane area in Maharashtra for the coming 2018-19 season from October is nearly 19 per cent up, while there are reports of UP farmers, too, planting more, undeterred by mounting payment arrears. One reason for this could be sugarcanes hardiness and ability to withstand hail, frost, fire, water, nilgai and wild boar, making it practically a default crop in areas where there is assured irrigation. The fact that its green top leaves can meet the fodder requirements of animals during the crushing period from October to April further adds to the attractiveness.But the current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops. We are, indeed, witnessing a disturbing trend now of farmers going back to planting not just cane, but also paddy and wheat. These are safe crops, where there is reasonable guarantee of receiving minimum support price (MSP) through government procurement. Sugarcane farmers, likewise, know that mills will eventually be forced to pay the FRP/SAP, though the monies may come with a few months delay. Theres no such certainty of return or even yields vis--vis other crops. Bt cotton has lost its bite, with the existing hybrids becoming increasingly susceptible to white-fly and pink bollworm attacks. Oilseeds and pulses have been trading below MSPs over the last 2-3 harvesting seasons. Farmers arent making money even in vegetable cultivation: Tomatoes in Kolar (Karnataka), onions in Lasalgaon (Maharashtra) and potatoes in Agra (UP) are currently selling or were just sold at Rs 6-7 per kg.Given these realities, it is not difficult to see why farmers are seeking a flight to safety  from chana to wheat in Madhya Pradesh, tur, soyabean and ginger to sugarcane in Marathwada, cotton and maize to paddy in Punjab. This is more akin to distress migration rather than a response to any profit signals. The policy prescription to address it is simple: The Centre and state governments should desist from hiking MSPs/FRPs/SAPs of paddy, wheat and sugarcane, which will further incentivise the cultivation of these relatively water-intensive crops. Instead, farmers should be ensured of getting MSPs and reasonable returns at least in oilseeds, pulses, tomatoes, onions and potatoes, whether through physical procurement or price deficiency payment transfers directly into their bank accounts.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

I start cooking after 10 a.m with the assistance of two persons. The gruel requires constant stirring to achieve proper consistency and we have to serve it hot. I stay back at the mosque till kanji is served, he said.Abdul Razack, 70, who leads the prayers in the mosque every day, says that it is ideal diet for people during fasting. It is cooked in a manner that it is easy to digest, he adds.The family of 56-year-old Mohammed Nasar, president of the Pallivasal, has been doing this service for 11 generations. It was his great grandfather Nanu Sahib who built this mosque in 1928. We have taken up this service for generations. During Ramzan month, people who pray at the mosque donate towards the preparation of kanji. The names of all the 30 donors are displayed in the mosque. They donate a minimum of Rs. 10,000 per day to buy 50 kg rice, vegetables and other ingredients required to prepare the kanjiHe added that tokens are issued to 300 people.

We have an archival recipe record of nearly 400-500 dishes, which we have served in our restaurant in the last 75 years, says Akash K Kalra, Managing Director, The United Group. Of these, around 150-200 dishes are on the menu all the time. We keep going back to these, bringing it back to our customers, adapting it to suit their palate and new trends, adds Kalra.Despite this emphasis on food, when United Coffee House started, food was not its focal point. It was more of a place to meet and chat  an adda of sorts. As Kalra says, For many, this was a place to walk in on Sundays after listening to the military nand play and watching the fountains at Central Park for a cup of coffee with snacks.Making the right brewEstablished in 1942, it was the brain child of Lala Hans Raj Kalra (Akash Kalras grandfather), the son of a liquor baron who had a flourishing liquor business in Sialkot in Pakistan. The family moved to Delhi and were based in Chandni Chowk.The first foray into hospitality came with the setting up of the Esplanade Restaurant & Bar in 1938-39 to cater to the American GIs who had their barracks at the Red Fort. It proved to be very popular, but since it was meant for the GIs, it wound up with their moving out after the War in the early 40s.Around that time, Hans Raj Kalra heard of an affluent shopping arcade in Lutyens Delhi called Connaught Place, which had been built in the shape of a horse shoe, for luck. What it lacked was a coffee house. He bought the place and opened United Coffee House.In the 40s, the place would be open from 11 am to 8 pm, typically selling street snacks of Old Delhi. Kalra says, Food then was commercial. No one would eat home food outside, so it was only omelette, chana bhatura, tikka...Post-Independence, the hours extended, and by the 60s it became a full-fledged restaurant. The cuisine initially was a mix of the Old Delhi Kayasth food and Frontier Province Pakistani food.The menu expanded, and during their lifetime, the place had served everything from commercial food, bibiyana (homemade) food, Madras club food, Bombay club food, Calcutta club food, Anglo Indian, khansama-cooked memsahib cuisine, to continental food, Asian, Mexican, Lebanese and, of course, Indian.Conceived in the British era, it still holds a fondness for the Old Raj cuisine, especially British club food  cheese balls, cutlets, samosas, chops.On the menuKalra says, We are known for our keema samosa, cheese balls, tomato fish and chicken a la Kiev. These have not been invented by us, but our variation is a huge hit. There are plenty of other staples  chapli kebabs, Railway mutton curry, dak bungalow chicken curry, chicken Maryland, coq au vin, chicken a la princess.Kalra explains, My grandfather had the acumen to get some of the finest cooks of those times to work for us. With their feedback and my grandfathers insight, a dish would be perfected after many trials. For example, a chef from Lucknow might add raw mango and bay leaf to a dak bungalow chicken curry, which made the taste entirely different from the usual one.To commemorate the 75th year, a new menu was unveiled in May. Classic dishes which had not been on the menu for 20-30 years were revamped.Kalra enthusiastically says, Fuyong, chow chows from Asia, buttermilk burgers were on the list. These dishes are being adjusted to suit todays palate. So if a baked salmon was served with boiled vegetables, today we would be doing it with braised bok choi.What works for UCH is that it still retains the old-world charm of the 1950s  the laid-back era of fine dining, huge chandeliers, unhurried knowledgeable waiters, the attention and care to the patrons with a sense of discreet familiarity."

5b2722759855b72a6d18b5fc,Farmers’ stir sign of rising distress,http://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/farmers-stir-sign-rising-distress-673207.html,2018-06-03,,Deccan Herald,"The 10-day agitation launched by farmers in seven states on Friday has intensified and is set to be extended to more states. The states where the farmers have started the stir include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, and those in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and other states may join them. The plan also includes a nationwide bandh on June 10. Farmers have resorted to protest actions like stopping the supply of produce to the mandis and it has started impacting the prices of vegetables, fruits and milk in cities and towns. The agitation is being organised by as many as 104 farmers bodies, led by the Rashtriya Kisan Sangh. It is unfortunate that farmers have to be in a perpetual mode of agitation, and it shows that their problems continue to remain unsolved. Farmers in Maharashtra made a long march to Mumbai in March. The Maharashtra government accepted their demands but the promises are yet to be implemented.The farmers have made a number of demands, including remunerative prices for their produce and waiver of farm loans. The agitation is mainly against the central government. The Narendra Modi government had promised to raise the minimum support prices to 150% of the cost of production, as recommended by the Swaminathan Committee, but it has not done that. It had promised to double farmers income by 2022, but most farmers are poorer now than they there a few years ago. Indebted farmers continue to commit suicide. The present plight in many places is not because of the failure of crops resulting from drought or other reasons but because of higher production and the consequent fall in prices. For example, the production of potatoes, tomatoes and garlic has increased but this has led to their prices falling below cost. Marketing of produce is a major problem because of the existence of intermediaries, and the farmer never gets the right price. Official policies often work against the interests of farmers. The government has decided to import sugar and tur dal when there is a glut of these in the country.The lack of facilities for preservation of perishable produce like fruits and vegetables and the absence of an efficient and transparent marketing mechanism are major problems. There is no system to give guidance to farmers on the crops to be cultivated on the basis of projections of demand and supply.

Along the 856km border between them, much of which is fenced, Indian families live outside the barrier, connected with gates manned by the BSF.On Sunday, when Assembly elections will be held in Tripura, these residents will come out of their caged existence to vote. At Jainagar here, 39 Muslim families had their homes on the wrong side when the fence came up nearly 12 years ago. Since then, their movements are restricted by the clock - the gates open at 6am and close at 8.30pm.Along the border, these gates are numbered. At Gate 86, young Sofikul seeks the BSF sentry's permission to come out with his bicycle and head to school. He needs to make a written entry and produce his identity card and a yellow gate pass issued by the BSF.Hasina Khatun, 55, needs to go back home inside the fence, so her name is marked on the register at the gate.She had accompanied her 32-year-old son, Bashir Mia to hospital to treat a deep cut on his palm. Hasina rues having to adhere to gate deadlines; it impinges on her freedom of movement especially when there are family celebrations in town. ""If we are late in returning, we have to spend the night with relatives outside. We appreciate the security, especially with our paddy fields and tomato patches safe from intruders. But it is like living in a cage. On voting day, we will have to leave home early,"" she says.""There is no mosque inside, so we need to come out even for prayers,"" adds Bashir.The opening and closing of these gates is strictly regulated. The BSF sentries deposit the keys at the camp and the procedure to reopen the gates in an emergency involves securing permission from the authorities, the BSF company commander at Konaban in Sipahijala district, Pawan Yadav explains.Having travelled 60km along the fencing, with a lone sentry at each gate, one reaches the Kamalasagar company headquarters of the force. The security on this smuggling-prone stretch is double-layered: area domination patrols by day and ambush-cum-patrol teams at night. At Radhanagar, Abul Kasam Mia, Joydeep Debnath and Dhirendra Debnath stand at the CPM rally kiosk. The sitting MLA looks set to retain his seat here.On reaching Belabor (Gate 92), we find villagers Abdul Majid and Sajal Mia emerging from the gates. Theirs is a piquant situation: their homes are on the Indian side of the gate, but the farmland lies on the other side, so they make multiple entries during the day. At Gate 98 at Motinagar, 400 people live inside the fence. On Sunday, these voters will troop out and head for the nearest booth. ""Our strange existence is not an electoral issue, we have learnt to live with it,"" one of them adds."

(Image used for representational purpose)A little over a month since the Union Budget declared a special Operation Green for tomato, onion and potato growers, prices of at least the first two produces seem to be touching an all-time low in the state. With wholesale prices of both the commodities going down to single digits, most farmers are staring at major agrarian distress. In Maharashtra, the wholesale markets of Junnar in Pune and Pimpalgaon in Nashik are major hubs of tomato trade.On Friday, the Pimpalgaons market had recorded the arrival of 695 crates of tomatoes, and the average traded price per crate was Rs 61. With a crate containing 20 kg of tomato, the average price per kg works out to be Rs 3 at the wholesale markets. Similarly, at the Narayangaon wholesale market, 6,330 crates of the produce had arrived, and the average traded price of a crate was Rs 60, which also translates to Rs 3 per kg. Junnar is normally the hub of summer tomatoes, while Pimpalgaon mostly gets the the winter crop.Onions, which till recently, were trading above the Rs 20 per kg mark, has also started trading below the Rs 10 per kg at most wholesale markets. At Lasalgaons wholesale market in Nashiks Niphad taluka, the average traded price of onion was Rs 7.54 per kg, with the market recording the arrival of 15,140 quintals of the bulb. Just about a month ago, onions were trading at Rs 15.50 per kg at this market, a steady fall of over 50 per cent.Maharashtra has seen a 10-15 per cent rise in area under cultivation for both onions and tomatoes. Shriram Ghadhave, president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India (VGAI), attributed this growth to the good rainfall received in the state last year. As against the 2.5 lakh hectares of tomato area, this year, we have about 3 lakh hectares under the crop. Even places like Beed, Aurangabad and Parbhani, which normally do not see cultivation of summer tomatoes, have planted the crop, he said.A similar situation has resulted in the steep price fall in case of onions also. Ghadhave added that inter-state trade has almost stopped with traders from north India absent from the market.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

A la carte. Im talking about the 40s, 50s and 60s, when Bombays food culture was blooming.This is before anyone could conceive that surnames like Lokhandwala and Hiranandani would mutate into names of suburbs. It was a time when restaurants along the Churchgate strip, hotels like The Taj Mahal and virtuosos like Chef Masci (Miguel Arcanjo Mascarenhas) were introducing the Bombay elite to words like Velout, Bchamel, Au Gratin and Flamb. The city was warming up to what was generically called Continental food.Lets stop there for a moment and examine that term. The Continent is Europe and the influence is from France and Italy and maybe the odd dish from Hungary and Russia. The cuisines of these countries slowly swaying the humdrum, morose tastes of Great British Cooking. And that food making its way to our metropolitan aspirations.Me with my lobster thermidor. This marriage of creamy seafood/ meat, egg and wine are hallmarks of the cuisine that ruled Bombay menus from the 40s through the 60s.Now cooks and butlers in Calcutta, Madras and Bombays posh clubs, and households too, were turning into desi Escoffiers, all expertly mastering Continental dishes. Innovative and complicated recipes like Chicken a la Kiev (a little hand-grenade sized ball of crumb fried hollow chicken served with buttered beans, carrots and mashed potato), or Chicken and Ham Timbale (minced chicken and ham, steam-baked in cups and served with mushroom sauce) or Welsh Rarebit (which is nothing but a sauce of melted cheese with red chilli, poured over slices of toasted bread) or Ramekins of Eggs (eggs baked in cheese sauce) or a Shepherds Pie (mince baked with mashed potatoes) became commonplace in the not-so-commonplace eateries.For the next 35 years or so, this cuisine reigned supreme at every banquet, buffet and blowout. No party or dinner was complete without dishes like Eggs Florentine, Vegetable Au Gratin, Poulet  la Crme et Champignons (chicken with cream and mushrooms) or Steak Chateaubriand (thick tenderloin in a shallot and red-wine reduction with chateau potatoes), always served for two.But just when you think youve learned the way to live, life changes. The 21st century brought along with it liquid nitrogen, lecithin and foams and nearly wiped out words like Espagnole, Hollandaise and Roux. Continental food got sidelined. Now considered an unhealthy, butter- and flour-laden cuisine, the world woke up to Paul Bocuse, Pierre Gagnaire, Heston Blumenthal and MasterChef on television.Just a few restaurants in Bombay still keep the richness and simplicity of Continental cuisine alive, like The Society at Ambassador Hotel with their Chicken Diane, among other dishes.Distance brings nostalgia, and with nostalgia comes perspective, and maybe objectivity. Just a few restaurants still keep the richness and simplicity of that cuisine alive. I head to Gallops at the race course for a Chicken Cecelia (sauted in butter and topped with cheese, mushroom and asparagus), and to The Society at Ambassador Hotel, which is still famous for their Roast Duck in Orange Sauce, Coq au Vin  and for that fact that the server comes to the table to flamb you a Chicken Diane or Spaghetti a la Fernandes.But my discovery of the year has been the nostalgic menu at Fenix at The Oberoi. Executive chef Satbir Bakshi has turned this modern, unassuming caf into one of the finest gourmet destinations in the city. I went there to celebrate my birthday with friends, and we started with classic Lobster Bisque. This is a wholesome crustacean soup (in this case, crayfish) thick, creamy and well-seasoned, with a base of tomato. If youre not careful, the soup could get too fishy, but this was just perfectly flavoured. Along with the bisque we ordered some good old-fashioned Prawn Cocktail. Thats cooked prawns in a cocktail sauce (essentially ketchup plus mayonnaise with a few shakes of Tabasco). At Fenix, Chef Satbir garnishes the Prawn Cocktail with thin slices of boiled egg and tops it all with caviar.At Fenix at The Oberoi, executive chef Satbir Bakshi garnishes the Prawn Cocktail with thin slices of boiled egg and tops it all with caviar.For the main course we shared Fish  la Meunire. A Meunire sauce, made from butter, lemon, and parsley, served with crispy sauted fish.But all eyes were on the Lobster Thermidor. Its a dish that has fascinated me since I was a child. So much so that I learnt to cook it when I was very young. Legend and Wiki say that the great French chef Auguste Escoffier created this dish in a Parisian restaurant called Maison Maire, near the Thtre de la Porte-Saint-Martin. The dish was named after a play, Thermidor by Victorien Sardou, which opened in that theatre to packed houses. Its whole lobster shell, stuffed with a creamy mixture of cooked lobster meat, egg yolk and cognac or white wine, gratinated with Gruyre and baked till brown. Its luxury from another day, and Fenix does it impeccably."

(Illustration: C R Sasikumar, Sarfaraz Alam) As two of the seven years have already passed and given the performance of agriculture in 2016-17 and 2017-18, the required CAGR in the remaining five years will have to be much higher than these rates. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar, Sarfaraz Alam)Prime Minister Narendra Modi is one of the best orators in Indian politics today. He is not only coherent and inspiring but connects with his audience well. He is ambitious and committed to fast-track the economy. He sets high targets and drives government machinery to achieve them. In the process, he raises aspirations and expectations of people which if not met, run the risk of hurting his own and the governments credibility.Unrealistic promises that remain unfulfilled could hurt the PMs political capital. People could doubt his intent, his understanding of involved challenges, or the capability of his government to deliver. The case in point is his often-repeated ambition of doubling farmers real incomes by 2022. By all means, we want to see him succeed in his ambition. However, our analysis and professional acumen informs us otherwise. We believe that farmers real incomes cannot be doubled even by 2025. The target of achieving it by 2030 seems more plausible. In saying so, we run the risk of being unpopular but as Gandhiji once said, Its easy to stand with the crowd. It takes courage to stand alone. And so, we gather courage to say that the ambition of doubling farmers income by 2022 is a pipe-dream and not a serious target.PM Modi spoke of his dream of doubling farmers income by 2022 for the first time in February 2016. This was repeated in successive budget speeches of the finance minister. In Ap06ril 2016, the Dalwai Committee was formed; it came out with a 14-volume report to identify ways to double farmers income from the 2015-2016 levels, in real terms, in seven years. Since there was no updated estimate of actual level of farmers incomes in 2015-16, the Committee arrived at estimates by applying net state domestic product (NSDP) growth rates on estimated state-wise farmers incomes of 2012-13 (from the NSSO). It found that an average Indian farmer household earned Rs 96,703 in 2015-16 (this was Rs 77,977 in 2012-13 according to the NSSO). Doubling this to Rs1,93,406 (at 2015-16 prices) by 2022-23, needed real incomes to grow at CAGR of 10.4 per cent at the all India-level, and at differentiated rates at state-level. Graph-1 compares the actually achieved growth rates in farmers real incomes (NSSO 2002-03 to 2012-13) with growth rates required (2015-16 to 2022-23) to double farmers income.States like Bihar where real incomes of farmers was at (-)1 per cent (CAGR) between 2002-03 and 2012-13 would require a CAGR of 12.3 per cent between 2015-16 and 2022-23 to achieve the governments target. This sounds very unlikely. There are similar unrealistic expectations from other moderate-performing agricultural states like West Bengal, UP and Jharkhand.As two of the seven years have already passed and given the performance of agriculture in 2016-17 and 2017-18, the required CAGR in the remaining five years will have to be much higher than these rates. For example, instead of 10.4 per cent, the average incomes of farmers should grow at 13 per cent nationally if the goal is to be achieved. To achieve this, the Committee estimates that about Rs 6.4 lakh crore (at 2011-12 prices) is needed by the country as additional investment. Eighty per cent of this must come from the government. Interestingly, the committee does not mention how the government intends to mobilise this amount.On February 19-20, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare organised a conference, Agriculture2022-Doubling Farmers Income. About 300 stakeholders argued their case. The PM shared his aim to overhaul the agriculture sector and double farmers incomes through a four-pronged strategy. This involves reducing costs of cultivation (through neem-coating urea and soil health cards); ensuring better prices for produce (through new cost plus-pricing MSP formula, reforming agri-markets through e-NAM and upgrading 22,000 village-markets); reducing wastage in the value-chain (through proper storage, logistics, food processing, and implementing Operation Greens-TOP (tomatoes, onions and potatoes); and diversifying sources of farmer incomes (through blue, organic, sweet revolution).Overall, there were no dearth of recommendations. But how many of these will be accepted and implemented, and by when will they deliver, is anybodys guess.We may differ with the PM on the number of years needed to fulfill his dream, but we are with him in his drive to double farmers income. For the journey ahead, we have three suggestions/questions for him. First, can he dump the inherent consumer-bias in countrys marketing and trade policies? Massive and growing food subsidies (marred with high inefficiencies) is an example of such a bias. He needs to revisit the archaic ECA, revitalise inefficient APMCs, put an end to ad hoc export bans and ensure a stable policy-environment for domestic agri-trade and exports to flourish. Second, how does he plan to absorb the production boom that will result from implementation of various recommendations? Will consumption keep pace with production? Will the solution be in processing, exports or in augmenting demand? Third, can he dump the subsidy model and embrace an investment model? Of the total resources (Rs 3.66 lakh crores) going to agriculture (and food) (see Graph-2), can he restrict subsidies on food, MNREGA, and farm inputs to less than 25 per cent and increase share of investments in/for agriculture to 75 per cent? Unless the PM makes these bold and rational policy decisions, chances of augmenting farmer incomes are bleak, let alone doubling them by 2022-23.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

(Illustration: C R Sasikumar) The country lacks modern storage facilities and the links between processing and organised retailing are very weak. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)The finance minister announced Operation Greens, on the lines of Operation Flood, with a seed capital of Rs 500 crore in his speech on February 1. Three days later, the Prime Minister backed the scheme at a parivartan rally in Bengaluru. He said farmers are his TOP priority  T is for tomatoes, O for onions, and P for potatoes.Operation Flood changed the face of milk production in India, making the country the largest producer of milk in the world  in 2016-2017, the country produced 164 million metric tonnes (MMT). But its important to note that Operation Flood was driven largely by smallholders and the AMUL model has ensured that 75-80 per cent of the price paid by milk consumers goes to the farmers. Operation Greens wants to replicate that success story in fruit and vegetables, starting with tomatoes, onions and potatoes.The main objective of this project, according to the finance ministry, is to reduce price volatility in these commodities, thereby helping farmers augment incomes on a sustainable basis. It also aims to provide these vegetables to consumers at affordable prices. The litmus test of this scheme would be in containing the booms and busts in prices. It will need to avert situations where farmers have been forced to dump potatoes and tomatoes on roads. Also, checking the prices from going through the roof has compelled the government to ban exports. It has resorted to de-stocking and conducted income tax raids on traders  the raids on onion traders in September last year is a case in point.India is the second largest producer of vegetables in the world with about 180 MMT. But China produces four times more vegetables than India. The accompanying graph shows a structural break in Indias vegetable production around 2003-2004. Although not as revolutionary as the Green Revolution in wheat, or the White Revolution in milk, yields of potatoes, onions and tomatoes  which constitute almost half of the countrys vegetable production  have shown a healthy growth. For example, between 2003-2004 and 2017-2018, potato production increased from 28 MMT to 49 MMT while onion yields went up from 6.3 MMT to 21 MMT and tomato production increased from 8.1 MMT to 22 MMT.However, the problem with these commodities is that their prices collapse when their production rises sharply. This is because the country lacks modern storage facilities and the links between processing and organised retailing are very weak. As a result, farmers often end up receiving less than a fourth of what consumers pay in major cities. This must change. Operation Greens needs to ensure that farmers receive at least 60 per cent of what consumers pay. In the case of milk, the producers get more than 75 per cent of what consumers pay. The basic principles of Operation Flood would be useful to operationalise Operation Greens as well.What are these principles? First, link major consumption centres to major production centres with a minimal number of intermediaries. As Verghese Kurien wrote in his book, I too had a Dream, organising farmers and increasing production is an easier job. The real challenge is to find the right markets that can give them remunerative prices on a sustainable basis. So, one needs to map mega consuming centres and link their retail networks with the producing centres of each commodity. Farmers can be organised in farmer producer organisations (FPOs). NABARD and SFAC (Small farmers agribusiness consortium) together have about 3,000 FPOs, which could be the starting points for the aggregation of commodities, assaying, sorting, grading, and even packing with bar codes, reflecting their traceability.The Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act will have to be changed to allow direct buying from FPOs, and giving incentives to these organisations, private companies and NGOs to build back end infrastructure as was done in the case of milk. The announcement of tax concessions to FPOs for five years is a welcome step in that direction, if it encourages building such critical infrastructure.Second is the investment in logistics, starting with modern warehouses, that can minimise wastage. An example is of cold storage for onions, where wastage is reduced to less than 10 per cent, compared to the 25-30 per cent wastage in traditional storage facilities on farmers fields. Such storage facilities have to be cost effective. A potato cold storage in UP, for example, that buys power at almost Rs 10/kwh from SEBs, can become efficient by generating solar power at less than Rs 4/kwh. Large-scale investments in storage will require tweaking of the Essential Commodities Act.Third is linking the processing industry with organised retailing. On an average, about one-fourth of the produce must be processed. India is way behind on this curve compared to most Southeast Asian countries. Dehydrated onions, tomato puree and potato chips should become cheap, so that an average household can use them. Processing industry adds value and absorbs surpluses. Seen this way, the finance ministers announcement of increasing the allocation for the food processing industry by 100 per cent is a welcome step. The food processing ministry will have to coordinate with Operation Greens.By developing such forward and backward linkages, the government can ease large price fluctuations, raise farmers share in the price paid by the consumer and at the same time, ensure lower prices for the consumers  a win-win situation for all.However, Operation Greens would need a champion to implement this vision and strategy with honesty, another Kurien, for at least three to five years. A babu will not work. Can the government locate another Kurien?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

It requires little effort and you dont have to clean up after your friends. In some countries, it is no longer unusual to live with automatons made to order, and spare oneself the demands of a human relationship. And it has become easy to be lonely in the crowd. Some of the most densely peopled spots, like airport terminals, are also the loneliest. For those who cant adjust to isolation, government help is at hand. Last month, Theresa May appointed Tracey Crouch the first minister for loneliness of the UK. In the US, former surgeon-general Vivek Murthy has warned of the health hazards of loneliness, which has apparently doubled since the 1980s.Loneliness isnt strictly for the birds, but Nigels means of coping was not quite human. Someone who buys a robotic partner knows what theyre doing. But well never know if Nigel understood that his lady love was a concrete decoy and chose to ignore the fact.

In Anna Karenina, only if a person is satisfied on all counts will she be happy. The allocations in the budget cover every sector, with umpteen implications, and no persons expectations can be fulfilled on all counts. While every expectation cant be met, it must be acknowledged that Finance Minister (FM) Arun Jaitley has presented a budget which focuses on rural India and is a great leap forward for the policy-battered farm sector. According to Article 112 of the Constitution, the Union Budget is simply a statement of the estimated receipts and expenditures of the government for a particular year.Rather than the budget being an annual jamboree for announcing policies, the prime minister should address the nation with his ideas for the coming year, based on which the FM should subsequently present the budget. The first step towards atonement and for penance is to acknowledge past failure. As the Economic Survey rightly states, real incomes of farmers have been stagnant. The next step is to take corrective measures and redeem the situation. An effort has been initiated in that direction in this budget.Assurance of purchase of all crops for which MSP is declared is a positive step. If the governments promise is of A2+50 per cent profit, then it is half-baked. It should have simultaneously announced acceptance of the Ramesh Chand Committees recommendations on the calculation of MSP, which it has not. The Niti Aayog is finally evolving into the credible policy think-tank we had been hoping for. It is also supposed to come out with a suitable mechanism to enable institutional credit access to lessee farmers.The Agri-Market Infrastructure Fund, with a corpus of Rs 2,000 crore, is to be set up for developing and upgrading agricultural marketing infrastructure in the 22,000 Gramin Agricultural Markets and 585 Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs). This will enable farmers in remote locations who are devoid of any institutional mechanism to connect to markets. Operation Green on the lines of Operation Flood to tackle the volatility of tomato, onion and potato prices is a positive development. The long-standing demand of income tax exemption for farmer producer organisations has been fulfilled. A Rs 10,000 crore fund to finance the infrastructure requirements of fisheries, aquaculture and animal husbandry will generate rural employment and supplement farmer incomes.The intent to mitigate the air pollution woes of Delhi-NCR by subsidising the machinery required for in-situ management of crop residue has now been addressed. Targeted programmes like those under the Prime Minister Krishi Sinchai Yojna for 96 irrigation-deprived districts, where less than 30 per cent of the land holdings get assured irrigation, is the way forward. The focus on horticulture clusters and converting cattle dung and solid waste in farms to compost, fertiliser, biogas and bio-CNG is also commendable.Read | Budget 2018 explained: Arun Jaitleys budget has no creative incrementalism on showThe flagship National Health Protection Scheme to cover over 50 crore poor and vulnerable beneficiaries providing coverage upto Rs 5 lakh per family per year for hospitalisation is outstanding. But the fund allocation for the programme is insignificant. I wonder if it will suffer the fate of many of last years budget announcements which have not materialised due to lack of allocations. In Davos, there was a general scepticism regarding the data presented to project the Indian growth story. A similar apprehension persists regarding the fund allocations in this budget.Climate change worries have not been addressed as agriculture R&D has been ignored. Nor is there a mention of the balanced use of fertilisers. The magic-bullet demand for changing the Centre-state funding ratio from 60:40 to 90:10 for agriculture-related schemes has unfortunately been overlooked.A constant red thread running uniformly through the budgets of the past 10 years, presented by three finance ministers of India, is that farmer suicides have not abated. In the last three years, over 36,000 farmers have committed suicide.Power is the capacity to change the lives of people. The prime minister must direct his immense power to bring the sorry saga of farmer suicides to an end. Budget allocations serve as the perfect instrument to change the narrative of resentment to one of hope. He must quickly solve farmers crises or heed the warning, given in different circumstances, by Benjamin Franklin: We must all hang together or most assuredly we will all hang separately.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Price of sambar onion has fallen from Rs 160/kg to Rs 35/kg since November, while the price of tomato reduced from Rs 20/kg to Rs 8/kg. Traders at the market said that the fall in price will persist for three more weeks till the second crop of the year comes along.Koyambedu vegetables, fruits and flowers traders welfare association president M Thyagarajan , who is a tomato trader, said, Usually, we receive 400-450 loads of vegetables daily. But now we are getting nearly 550 loads. Yield from the first crop of the year (December  January) is usually the highest due to cold weather and availability of excess water. Price of vegetables is set to gradually rise with the arrival of the second crop from February 20.Water-rich vegetables like turnip (nookal), radish (mullangi), chayote (chow chow), beetroot, okra (vendakkai), snake gourd (pudalangai) and white pumpkin (poosanikkai) are now priced at Rs 5- Rs 10. Koyambedu vegetables, fruits and flowers traders welfare association treasurer P G M Sukumar said, Foreign (non-indigenous) vegetables like cabbage, carrot, and capsicum require a greater amount of water to grow as compared to the local varieties. Price of these vegetables has fallen thanks to an excess rainfall.According to traders, the first crop yield is 100kg per acre while second crop (February-March) yield is only 50kg/acre. The wholesale price of vegetables like nookal and mullangi was Rs 5, while their retail price was Rs 10 on Monday.The price of tomato fell gradually since November 2017. Sukumar said, In November, the price of tomato was Rs 20/kg. It fell to Rs 15 in early December and by the end of the month, it was Rs 10. Now the price is Rs 8. Only the price of drumstick (Rs 50- Rs 60/kg) has remained stable since November 2017."

It has not set up a maize and groundnut procurement centre to purchase the crop from farmers. The state government led by chief minister Siddaramaiah and the district administration have neglected farmers for four and a half years, he said.The protest turned violent when BJP activists and the cattle headed to the DCs office. When police officers, including SP K Parashuram and Additional SP Annappa Naik tried to prevent them by setting up barricades, protesters hurled tomatoes and cow dung at them.BJP workers insisted on submitting their memorandum to the DC.

(Archive) With assembly elections in 10 states due later this year, the states going to the polls are making attempts to woo farmers. (Archive)Farm distress is likely to be one of the major focal points of the upcoming Union Budget. Agri-GDP growth has fallen to around 2 per cent per annum in the first four years of the Modi government; the real incomes of farmers have fallen as well. The growth in the agriculture sector is much below the Centres target and the government does not seem to be on course to double farmers incomes by 2022. With assembly elections in 10 states due later this year, the states going to the polls are making attempts to woo farmers. While some have announced loan waivers, others are trying to fix farmers woes emanating from tumbling farm prices. Here, we focus on two pilot projects to see if they can be scaled-up at the all India level.The first is the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (BBY), essentially a price deficiency payment (PDP) scheme, being undertaken by the government of Madhya Pradesh. BBY applies to eight kharif crops  soybean, maize, urad, tur, moong, groundnut, til, ramtil. The Haryana government has announced a somewhat similar scheme for four vegetables  potatoes, onions, tomatoes and cauliflower. The second pilot scheme we talk about is underway in Telangana, where the government gives all farmers an investment support for their working capital needs.Under the BBY, farmers have to first register on a portal. Their sown area is verified by government officials. They are then asked to bring their produce to mandis at a time fixed by the state government. Based on average productivity of a crop in the district and area cultivated by the farmer, the quantity of each produce that is eligible for deficiency payment is also determined by the government. Farmers receive the difference between average sale price (ASP) and MSP directly into their bank accounts. The scheme seems interesting as it provides an alternative to physical procurement of commodities at minimum support prices (MSPs). The ASP is calculated as the simple average of the weighted modal prices of the relevant crops in the regulated mandis of Madhya Pradesh and two adjoining states. The price information is drawn from the Centres agmarknet.gov.in portal.For kharif 2017-18, so far, data related to five crops (soybean, maize, groundnut, urad and moong) has been finalised for price deficiency payment. The market prices of til and ramtil are higher than the MSP and therefore they do not qualify for price deficiency payment. The tur season will start from February.The graph shows the key results of BBY for October-December, 2017. It is interesting to note that only 32 per cent of urad production in Madhya Pradesh got the yojanas benefit despite the fact that ASP of urad was 42 per cent below its MSP. In other words, 68 per cent of urad production was sold at prices below MSP, without any compensation under BBY. In the case of soybean, the states prime kharif crop, the percentage of production benefiting from this scheme is even lower  only 18.5 per cent, despite its ASP being 12 per cent below the MSP. And for maize, groundnut and moong, the coverage is even poorer (see graph).Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana: Who gained and how much? Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana: Who gained and how much?The Madhya Pradesh government claims to have paid about Rs 1,900 crore as compensation to farmers for these five crops. But that pertains to only those farmers registered on its portal. A larger proportion of farmers are not registered on the portal and they have been selling their produce at huge losses. These farmers have not received any compensation. In fact, those not registered under BBY have to suffer bigger losses because traders are suppressing the market. We have calculated their loss by multiplying the production not covered under BBY with the price difference between MSP and ASP. The actual prices in Madhya Pradesh are even lower than the ASP, which is the average of modal prices of three states. The total loss for these five crops comes to Rs 6,534 crore. So, if the scheme was fully successful and covered entire production, the Madhya Pradesh governments revenue outgo would be Rs 8,434 crore, and not Rs 1,900 crore. This would be more than 90 per cent of the states total budget for agriculture. In sum, BBY is not inclusive, covers less than 25 per cent of the farmers loss, involves too much micro-management by government officials and is prone to market manipulation.Haryanas scheme for four vegetables is even worse as the presumed MSP (Rs 400 per quintal for potatoes and tomatoes and Rs 500 per quintal for onions and cauliflower) does not even cover the full cost of production as estimated by the Union Ministry of Agriculture and the National Horticulture Board for these crops.In contrast to these programmes is the government of Telanganas input support scheme. Announced in the second week of January, the schemes objective is to relieve farmers from taking loans from moneylenders by giving them Rs 4,000 per acre for the kharif and rabi seasons. It is envisaged that the farmer will use this money for purchase of inputs ranging from seeds to fertilisers to machinery and hired labour. The area eligible for investment support is 14.21 million acre  the governments annual bill for the project, thus, comes to around Rs 5,685 crore.The Telangana model does not require the farmer to register his cultivated area and crops. The farmer is free to grow a crop of his choice and sell it anytime in a mandi of his choice. This model is crop-neutral, more equitable, more transparent, and gives farmers the freedom to choose. Incidentally, China has a similar scheme: It gives aggregate input subsidy support on a per acre basis. The scheme does not distort markets and is worth following.

Elamurugan believed that a pleasant ambience will help students learn better and set about creating a park around the school. The students of this school have identity cards like their private school counterparts, thanks to Elamurugan who spent from his pocket and collected money from alumni to provide this. For two years he has been providing snacks and tiffin, with the help of sponsors, to students who are preparing for SSLC and Plus Two examinations.The school, started in 1962, now has 903 students from classes VI to XII. ""Twenty-five years ago, I was working in a private school which had a lot of facilities for students. I cleared the teachers recruitment board exam and taught physics to Plus One and Plus Two students. After I became the headmaster of the school, I decided to do something for the students with the help of fellow teachers,"" said Elamurugan.""We issued identity cards for all students and teachers. We selected a group of students and made them members of the students protection committee. The group had to ensure that all students kept their nails and hair neatly trimmed. The names of those who do not maintain this are sent to the physical education teacher. If the students do not maintain discipline, their parents will be approached,"" said Elamurugan.The school also started a career guidance centre where students were prepared for competitive exams. ""The students live in villages and do not have much awareness about competitive exams. To promote savings and to create awareness about banking services, we opened bank accounts for 450 students and requested them to save money,"" he said.The school also has a counselling centre for students to beat stress. ""The parents of the many students are daily wage labourers and sometimes their family problems affect the children. So we give free counselling to the students and invite their parents to talk about their problems. In one case, a couple reunited for the sake of their sons future,"" said Elamurugan.He said a herbal garden on the school premises was maintained by a team of students. Another garden too is maintained by a team of students. Tomatos, chillies, and spinach are cultivated on the premises and these are used for the noon meal scheme.""We have two smart class rooms for students of Classes VI to XII. Our campus has an incinerator to burn sanitary napkins. We have a sanitary committee for girl students, with a few women teachers as committee leaders. Girl students can go to the committee with their problems at any time and get them addressed,"" said Elamurugan.The school also has a committee to save trees and another committee for water management. ""Our teachers conduct special classes for Class X and Plus Two students. Our endeavour is to provide education on a par with private schools,"" he says."

We should be proud of it as it is the only nation that blends many cultures, languages, castes and creed, Sindhu Rajan tells little Samirah while serving breakfast. The plate has chapati, rice, carrot and palak creatively transformed into a tricolour flag and people. Sindhu goes on about the freedom struggle while Samirah interrupts, Mamma, you should get a bigger plate for me. I wanted India Gate too.A mom who is well aware that the surefire way to instil patriotism in children is through the stomach, she cooks up a patriotic storm every Indian Independence Day and Republic Day. As we live in Seattle, Washington, and as she misses the festivities of our country, wherever there is any festival of India, we have food art at home. I narrate her stories related to our country while feeding her. And it never felt like a herculean task, says Sindhu.In Abudhabi, medical professional Sandya Menon too had a similar worry about her children Adithya Anoop and Advaith Anoop missing out on Indian culture. She too decided to go creative on the dining table by way of a solution. Come Republic Day and Independence Day, it is tricolour that is dished out. I keep on experimenting with different cuisines. I believe it is the best way to teach them about their nation and the spirit of Republic Day. And my narration of stories via food begin a week before. As they love sweets, I made tricolour vanilla sponge cake and cupcakes and will follow them up with puddings and pedas, she says.It seems to be a trend for NRIs to celebrate Republic Day with flavoured ideas. Rajeev Maravayal and Sangeetha Rajeev live in Canada and Sangeetha likes to surprise her hubby with a sweet dish on special occasions. On days related to India, I make sure to celebrate it with a special sweet, Sangeetha says. Madagascan vanilla bean cupcake is what she made for Rajeev on Independence Day and today, she is planning to serve a tricolour kesari for breakfast.Parvathy Menon, based in the US, packs such surprises in her better half Kirans lunch box. This time, I am making tiranga pulav using green chilies, tomato puree and rice. I will be serving salads and pickle along with it. I am inspired from my mom Prasanna Menon, she says. Prasannas masterpiece is yard long beans plus Carrot Sabji with Rice, an India special that is a hit with Parvathys friends. It is very simple and healthy as well, she adds.Marketing professional Jyothika Roy, who works in Dubai, rustles up trilicious pasta on such occasions. The word 'tricolour' or 'Tiranga' itself brings a sense of patriotism in all Indians. Indian festivals are always brighter and mightier for us who live outside India. Food plays an important role in such get-togethers. People often enjoy preparing food with the theme of tricolour, she says. For green sauce she has used spinach and the ingredients of white sauce is refined flour, milk and butter and the red Sauce base is of tomato.Tarun Alex from Ranni who is passionate about cooking is on a vacation at Dubai and is planning a South Indian breakfast for his friends, the speciality being tricolour idlis. People living outside their native place are always full of nostalgic feelings. So I thought of nourishing their taste buds with Indian spices and flavours, he says."

This young bio-technologist decided to make use of her degree and knowledge to make a change in the environment for the better.What started as a hobby, soon turned into a profession says Mansi, Due to my mother who has a green thumb even when we were kids we were always inclined towards growing plants and had a mini garden in the balcony. The love for greenery grew and with the help of my dad who has a printing press I decided to incorporate seeds in plain paper which can then grow into plants.Along with paper for gift wrapping, writing, note pads, invites, etc., Mansi also made mud modaks during the Ganapati festival and mud rangoli tiles during Diwali , all infused with paper seeds. And that is how the flags infused with paper seeds too was an idea that she thought of. We were already on a spree to make sure our festivals are green with green modaks and rangolis when I came up with the idea last year in January just before Republic Day. I started thinking about making such a product when I saw a lot of paper flags being made and sold at signals. What upset me though is that we see these same flags being dumped into the trash later that day or the next day. I realised that we as Indians claim to be patriotic in the way of listening to patriotic songs, hoisting our flag, etc., but we dont give a second thought to what happens to those flags post Republic or Independence Day. I realised I can initiate and make some change, so why not. We produced approximately 1000 seed paper flags about a week before Republic Day with the message Dont throw, grow me printed on the back. The idea is to encourage people to grow these flags into plants as opposed to just throwing them out. We made sure its fine to plant a flag and followed the Indian Flag code.The flags are made of handmade paper infused with seeds and the screen print uses vegetable inks. Talking about the seeds that go into the flag, Mansi says, We infuse the paper with a variety of seeds ranging from chilli and marigold to basil, tomato and tulsi. With the flags, in particular, we dont use different seeds for different colours but with other products this can be customised based on the requirement.Mansi remembers how initially when they distributed the flags in a housing society the enthusiasm of the children was infectious, They all made sure their parents, grandparents and friends all planted their flags and that no one threw them out. I have a very special memory of interacting with some children who had no idea what to do with the regular flags once they were done wearing them. On finding out that they could plant our flags they jumped up with excitement and started to enquire how they should plant it, what plant would emerge etc. Seeing their happy, excited reactions was thrilling and I knew that Im on the right path.The interest is ever growing and as compared to last year when Mansi started making paper seed flags to this year the response has been encouraging. Says Mansi, We, are now happy that this Republic Day there are many more flags out there which will grow into little plants and in their little way help preserve nature. And we all must know and realise the fact that there is no Planet B."

The experiment has yielded very good results and last year 500 households produced 48,000kg of the produce.The trust is calling this initiative nutrition farming and is insisting that none of these produces be sold in the market. We want every child in the family to have access to the balanced diet from their own produce. We discourage people to sell their produce and ask them to consume it within the family to fight malnutrition. We have been carrying out this experiment for last few years. Last year, there was a record produce of 48,000kg from 500 families, said Dr Satav.Earlier, the tribals grew only rice. Now they are growing jowar, soyabean, all major vegetables like ladys finger, carrot, radish, methi, palak, tomato, chilli, 5-8 types of different protein rich beans and peanuts.The Trust has taught them scientific selection of crops which include cereals, pulses, vegetables, vegetables rich in vitamins and minerals and oilseeds.A model farm was set up in the Trusts premises  an acres area housing hospital and residences of doctors and staff  at Karamagram in Utavali village. The integrating farming included crops like gram, rajgira, five types of beans, turmeric, chilli, tapioca, sweet potato, linseed fruits like papaya, amla, banana, chikoo and goti tea grass.Being a rain-fed area, Melghat gets no water from irrigation projects. So, tribals use the entire waste water from kitchen and houses for maintaining the garden. The patients visiting the hospital saw the farm and adopted the model gradually, said Dr Satav.Dr Satav says that there is a visible change in the health of tribals, especially children. He said the Trust will be monitoring the changes with scientific parameters, comparing them with population which does not have access to balanced diet on large-scale, and publish the results.Though we have been using the intervention model which uses ready-to-eat therapeutic foods for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and severe underweight (SUW) and that too has yielded very good results, in the long run cultivating the required food and consuming it is the only solution to malnutrition, said Dr Satav.The malnutrition rate in the 17 villages under various projects of Mahan Trust has gone down by 50%. Though the SAM rate in Melghat is about 7-8%, this figure in the project area under Mahan has reduced to just 1%. Similarly, the SUW rate in Melghat is 14-15% while it is 10% in the 17 intervention villages."

Those who braved the early morning chill to head to the Koyambedu wholesale market on Friday, part from of course retail merchants, came away with bagas of vegetables, most of them for a scarcely believable Rs 10 per kg and below.With truckloads of vegetables flooding the market, the cost of vegetables has crashed. Chandran , president of Koyambedu Market Licensed Merchants Association said brinjal, beans, cabbage, ladies finger (okra), broad beans and tomato sold for less than Rs 10 per kilogram.The arrival of trucks with these vegetables has increased by 25% from the average 100 to 125 vehicles. So, this has reflected in a significant drop , he said.While one kilogram of onion cost anything between Rs 30/kg and Rs 40/kg, potato and yam sold for Rs 15/kg to Rs 20/kg and Rs 20/kg to Rs 25/kg.The wholesale market received 450 trucks of vegetables and about 50 vehicles more to meet the demand for Pongal from different parts of Tamil Nadu , Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka The situation in the retail markets, however, was different, with residents in many areas saying prices were much higher.Responding to this, Chandran said retail traders would factor in a minimum a profit margin of Rs 10 for every kilogram of vegetables to meet the expenses incurred in transporting the goods to respective places."

Maintained jointly by teachers and students from classes VI to VIII, without affecting their classroom sessions, around 50-60 kg of vegetables of nine plant varieties are harvested at the school every week and supplied to the school kitchen for the noon meal scheme.The school has classes for standards I to VIII and a student strength of 140, of which classes up to standard IV are taught both English and in Tamil medium. Vegetable cultivation being done on about 0.25 acres within the school campus.Started in September 2016 with the personal interest of 42-year-old teacher S Elavalagan and subsequent cooperation from fellow staff, the green project expanded the acreage of horticulture crops from just 5 cents to 0.25 acres. Teachers along with the students would engage in vegetable plantation and also in maintaining existing plants. It is the self-interest of 57 students studying from classes VI to VIII that allowed the acreage of horticulture crops to expand. Parents are also supportive in the move as they willingly send their wards to school even on Sundays, S Elavalagan told TOI.With seeds obtained at free of cost from Indian Institute of Horticulture Research, Bengaluru, through good Samaritans , the school has planted about 18 vegetable varieties of which nine varieties render substantial yield on daily and weekly basis.Belonging to the small onion belt of Tamil Nadu , the school last week cultivated small onions within their campus and new vegetable breeds such as carrots, beetroot, cauliflower and cabbage. For the last one year we have been cultivating and harvesting tomato, ladies finger, bitter gourd, snake gourd and broad beans. Most of the yield will go to the school kitchen for preparing noon meals for the children and the surplus, on rotational basis, would be provided free of cost to the families of students who actively maintain the crops, Elavalagan added.The school with as many as seven teachers including the headmaster perhaps could have made revenue by selling the surplus vegetables to the shops, but instead preferred to plant green thoughts among students by giving harvested vegetables to students as a pat on their backs.M Guru, a class VII student, said that the green activity in school has motivated him to pursue farming in future and said that his parents were happy about their ward spending quality time in farming. My father migrated from agriculture even though my grandfather was a farmer. Completing my studies, I will certainly take up farming since it has become my passion, said Guru, spotted watering the vegetable plants on the school campus on Sunday.Another student of the school, R Kalaiselvan said that he feels relaxed while watering the plants rather than playing cricket with his friends. On an average, each week, at least 5-10 children are taking home surplus vegetable for which feedback from their houses is positive as the vegetables are grown organically."

For the first time on this red turf, Palamau district police and Jharkhand Jaguar deployed in the recently set up Chetma police picket played the role of family. They bought rasgullas, saris, utensils, a wristwatch, a bicycle, rice, pulses, edible oil and vegetables for the wedding.Father of the bride Kameshwar Baiga, whose daughter Anita got married to Arun, son of Udai Parhaiya of Kemo Pratappir in Japla, couldn't have asked for more.For villagers too, this was a novelty. People who ran away from the police now feasted and enjoyed wedding rituals in the company of deputy commandant of Jharkhand Jaguar Rakesh Mishra and other cops. In fact, policemen even welcomed the groom's party.Arun and his family came on a four-wheeler to Chetma, which has a motorable road, thanks to the police picket.Rice (50kg), flour (50kg), pulses (15kg), gram flour (10kg), sugar (30kg), edible oil, cucumber, onion, tomatoes we-re given to Baiga for the marriage feast by the police.

The new bicycle, wristwatch, saris and utensils, bought by the police, were handed over to the bride's father to be gifted to Anita.Police also gave a 30-litre jar of kerosene to Baiga who has not yet availed the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana that would have given him an LPG cylinder.Asked, Palamau SP Indrajeet Mahatha said state DGP D.K. Pandey asked them to take care of this family during the wedding. DGP Pandey told The Telegraph, ""I inspected Chetma police picket on April 11 and spent the night here.

Anil Kumar and senior functionaries of CFTRI to work out action plans to address the issue.Das was accompanied by chief secretary Sudhir Tripathi, additional chief secretary (finance) Sukhdev Singh, rural development principal secretary Avinash Kumar, industry secretary Sunil Kumar Barnwal, social welfare secretary Vinay Kumar Choube and state's nutrition mission director general D.K. Saxena.After detailed deliberations, the chief minister asked the DFRL representatives to provide equipment and training to the sakhi mandals.Initially, 12 food processing machines will be installed across the state - one machine for two districts.The machines will be handled by the sakhi mandals, who will also be responsible for transporting the packaged food to anganwadis. Some of the women will also be trained to become master trainers to mentor other women.To smoothly run these food processing units - with jobs ranging from installation of machines to transportation of packaged food - the sakhi mandals will be provided loans under Mudra Loan and Start-up India projects.Das said that since most of the malnutrition-triggered diseases were mainly caused by deficiency of protein, iron and fat, these factors should adequately be taken care of while preparing the ready-to-eat food.""For example, children like chocolates. We must make chocolates that can neutralise protein deficiency in their bodies,"" he stated later in a news release.The chief minister went on to say that since tomato, tamarind, peas and beans were abundantly grown in Jharkhand, his government would take initiatives to bring these to the food processing centres for production of sauces, jams and other products that would then be sold in the local market.""A healthy future generation is our primary objective. Money will never be a constraint to make our children healthy and sisters and daughters financially self-sufficient. Let us complete the necessary formalities at the earliest so that work can start in the new fiscal beginning on April 1,"" Das added."

Along the 856km border between them, much of which is fenced, Indian families live outside the barrier, connected with gates manned by the BSF.On Sunday, when Assembly elections will be held in Tripura, these residents will come out of their caged existence to cast their ballots. At Jainagar here, 39 Muslim families had their homes on the wrong side when the fence came up nearly 12 years ago. Since then, their movements are restricted by the clock - the gates open at 6am and close at 8.30pm.Along the border, these gates are numbered. At Gate 86, young Sofikul seeks the BSF sentry's permission to come out with his bicycle and head to school. He needs to make a written entry and produce his identity card and a yellow gate pass issued by the BSF.Hasina Khatun, 55, needs to go back home inside the fence, so her name is marked on the register at the gate.She had accompanied her 32-year-old son, Bashir Mia to hospital to treat a deep cut on his palm. Hasina rues having to adhere to gate deadlines; it impinges on her freedom of movement especially when there are family celebrations in town. ""If we are late in returning, we have to spend the night with relatives outside. We appreciate the security, especially with our paddy fields and tomato patches safe from intruders.

On voting day, we will have to leave home early,"" she says.""There is no mosque inside, so we need to come out even for prayers,"" adds Bashir.The opening and closing of these gates is strictly regulated. The BSF sentries deposit the keys at the camp and the procedure to reopen the gates in an emergency involves securing permission from the authorities, the BSF company commander at Konaban in Sipahijala district, Pawan Yadav explains.Having travelled 60km along the fencing, with a lone sentry at each gate, one reaches the Kamalasagar company headquarters of the force. The security on this smuggling-prone stretch is double-layered: area domination patrols by day and ambush-cum-patrol teams at night. At Radhanagar, Abul Kasam Mia, Joydeep Debnath and Dhirendra Debnath stand at the CPM rally kiosk. The sitting MLA, Narayan Chandra Chowdhury, looks set to retain his seat here.On reaching Belabor (Gate 92), we find villagers Abdul Majid and Sajal Mia emerging from the gates. Theirs is a piquant situation: their homes are on the Indian side of the gate, but the farmland lies on the other side, so they make multiple entries during the day.

It would also help us realise Prime Minister Narendra Modi's goal to double farmers' income by 2022.""The minister's letter also mentioned that Bihar happened to be the third largest vegetable producer and fifth largest fruit producer in the country. It also says that 80 per cent of the Makhana in the world is produced in Bihar.It is not the first time that a demand to include more items in the agriculture export promotion policy has been made. Earlier this month, the Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industries, too, had come up with a similar demand. The BCCI too had sent a letter to the Union minister sharing details of various products and their speciality on the basis of which the request was made."

One of the aims of the policy is to help achieve the Union government's aim of doubling the income of farmers by 2022.Some of the identified districts include Nagpur and Ratnagiri in Maharashtra for orange and Alphonso mangoes respectively, Kinnaur in Himachal Pradesh for apples, Lucknow and Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh for mangoes, and Belgaum and Mysore in Karnataka for pomegranates.However, the list is tentative and is to be fine tuned in consultation with the state government, trade and commerce bodies, farmers' associations and the common people. ""Our state has around 10 per cent population of the country and on this basis at least five districts out of total 50 should have been selected under the new policy that is coming up.

But there is an unlikely candidate this time, mangoes. Several factors seem to have ganged up to create such a situation.The APMC yard here has turned into a virtual trash bin as the fruits are rotting, but there are hardly any buyers. The furious growers are throwing the mangoes into the drains and on the roads. Among the reasons for the price crash are excess production and fall in demand from the middlemen.The rates have fallen to as little as Rs 10-12 a kilo for the Badami variety. The other varieties of mangoes are priced at Rs 4-5 a kg, down from Rs 100 a few days ago.Varieties like Sendur, Rasapuri and Neelam have no takers. Buyers purchased 240 quintals of Badami mangoes at Rs 900 to Rs 1,000 per quintal. Other varieties (740 quintals) sold at Rs 500-600 per quintal. Even tomato is commanding a better price than mangoes, say the growers.Many lorry loads of mango are returning to the market as some buyers are sending them back due to excesssupply. Earlier, these buyers, mostly juice producers, used to fall over each other to buy both ripe and raw mangoes. However, this time, the buyers are imposing conditions on what they want.Nipah scareThe scare of the spread of Nipah virus through mangoes has discouraged retail consumers from buying them and so, the demand has crashed. Besides, there is a glut in production in Kolar, another major production centre.Many growers have left the mangoes to rot on the trees as they dont want to spend on the labour for plucking in the current situation."

In the first phase, the state became cent per cent organic producer.D. K. Bhandari, the director of the horticulture department, said to begin with, two floors of the multi-storied complex would be given to the farmers to sell their produce. ""Later, 85 stalls in the complex will be let out to the farmers. The complex will also house two cold storages and a canteen,"" he added.Similar complexes will also be constructed at Namchi in South Sikkim, Geyzing in West Sikkim and Mangan in North Sikkim. ""The Kisan Bazar will be open on all seven days of the week. The farmers can sell their vegetables from these complexes at their own prices,"" said Bhandari.The horticulture director, however, said once a stall was allotted to a local farmer, he or she would not be allowed to sub-let the places to others. ""If anyone is found sub-letting the stall, the allotment will be cancelled. This is being done to ensure that no middlemen get to usurp the stalls,"" he said.The government has also provided utility vehicles at different locations to enable farmers to ferry their produce to the nearby markets.

SIMFED (Sikkim State Co-operative Supply and Marketing Federation Ltd.) also has six vehicles (to ferry vegetables),"" said Bhandari.Pawan Awasthy, the managing director of the government-owned SIMFED, said given the fact that organic vegetables were costlier than the non-organic ones, his cooperative would try to sell vegetables at subsidised rates to customers. ""For instance, if we buy tomatoes from farmers at Rs 28 per kg, we will sell them at Rs 20. We will absorb the losses. Even though we are committed to giving subsidy as much as possible, it will not be to the extent of non-organic (rates),"" he said.Non-organic tomatoes procured from outside are being sold at Rs 15 per kilogram. Tomatoes are among the items exempted from the purview of the ban.

5b2e78bc9855b72640115dac,Farm crisis real but can be tackled,http://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/farm-crisis-real-can-be-tackled-667754.html,2018-05-02,,Deccan Herald,"One of the oldest civilisations, the Indus Valley civilisation, vanished because of persistent drought. This is a stark reminder to policymakers that they will have to tackle persistent drought in parts of the country failing which civilisation could disappear in a couple of centuries. Farm crisis in India is real, particularly in states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which is going to witness yet another drought this year despite good monsoon forecast for the third consecutive year in the rest of the country.This is one side of the coin but Agriculture Secretary S K Pattanayak, a Karnataka cadre IAS officer, argues that all is not bad with Indian agriculture. It has come a long way and this year India is going to have a bumper crop with food grain production touching a record 275 million tonnes, while horticulture, including fruits and vegetables, will produce a record additional 300 million tonnes. Also, the country has had a record bumper harvest of 23.6 million tonnes in pulses, the only source of protein to the vast vegetarian population.But the stark reality is that farming is the livelihood for half of the 1.25 billion people of India. A farmer must get a remunerative price and adequate income. Already next generation of farmers are moving away from farming and this could have a catastrophic effect on who will feed the 125 crore people, which is not a small number. Also, if the Indian economy has to clock a double-digit growth on a sustained basis, the farm sector has to grow by at least 4% annually on a continuous basis, which has not happened so far. This is necessary to ensure poverty is eradicated.For the woes of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu farmers, Pattanayak said they should change their cropping pattern from water-guzzling crops like paddy and sugarcane and switch over to drip irrigation, which will reduce water consumption drastically. It is a crime to cultivate sugarcane in Maharashtra. Sugarcane should be cultivated in flood-prone areas of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and perhaps the Northeast as it could also be flood protected.Punjab should not be cultivating basmati rice. The practice of which has brought down the water table to a dangerous level. Israel, which has a mere 300 mm of average rainfall, did not find water shortage a major problem and its farm yield is one of the highest. India gets bountiful rainfall and perhaps one of the few countries to have monsoon as a season every year.Even in the arid zones of Rajasthan and Karnataka, the average rainfall is around 800 mm, which is more than double that of Israel. All one has to do is harness this through rainwater harvesting so that fresh water does not go unutilised into the sea. The government, therefore, is rightly giving priority to minor irrigation and desilting of all the existing tanks, besides immediately taking up 99 stalled irrigation projects. This has to be done on a war footing.What is needed now is to make agriculture smart, which has not happened so far in India despite the Green Revolution that only ensured there are no more starvation deaths. Farmers income needs to be not only doubled but at least quadrupled from the present level of Rs 20,000 annually. One way could be to provide income support as in the US instead of price support by way of Minimum Support Price (MSP). Because of high MSP for certain crops like food grains, rich farmers grow these crops to take advantage of procurement as only they have a marketable surplus.The top 10% of Indian farmers produce 60-70% of marketable surplus in food grains. The remaining 90% have only 30% of marketable surplus and hence they get very little benefit from the price support system. The resulting depression of prices for poor farmers in the market leads to distress sale of the small quantity they produce.If income support is given instead, market forces will come into play and the farmer can produce any crop that the market demands and not only those that have price support, which leads to excess production and subsequent depression of prices. This will also ensure that crop failures do not hit farmers hard.If farmers income has to rise, the dependence only on agriculture for income has to change and farmers will have to take to animal husbandry, poultry, fisheries, food processing and other agri-related rural industries and so on for augmenting income. This is because farming by its very nature is seasonal and hence there is disguised unemployment even in the best of times.As the Swaminathan Committee has pointed out, market access to poor farmers is a major problem in India. Bumper tomato crop forces a farmer to sell it at Re 1 per kg but in the retail market, it is not available for less than Rs 20. But Re 1 does not cover even the cost of production. A farmer gets Rs 6 per coconut but in the retail market, it is not available for less than Rs 40. Who then gets the benefit? It is neither the farmer nor the consumer but the rich middlemen.So what is the way out? An Amul like cooperative model that brought about the White Revolution has to be replicated for all crops so that farmers get a remunerative price and the food products are marketed better and exported. The wastage of fruit, vegetables and other crops running into thousands of crores can be minimised. This will facilitate setting up of common cold storage for horticulture produce in areas where they are grown.Amul like cooperatives will also ensure crop insurance, better quality seeds, pesticides and other inputs, thereby minimising crop failures and loss of farm income.--(The writer is a senior journalist based in New Delhi)"

The bulk of treatment methods viz. chemotherapy, radiation and surgery, involve much pain and severe side effects.Newer, less toxic and less painful therapies have brought significant relief in managing cancers and some decline in mortality due to cancer has been recorded in a few developed countries (US, Denmark, Sweden and Slovakia) as per a study published in The Lancet. Yet, overall, it remains a serious health threat worldwideGlobally, over 7 million deaths occur due to cancer yearly. In 2016, $113 billion was spent on therapeutic and supportive care of those living with the disease, a figure projected to grow to $147 billion by 2021.In lay terms, cancer is the attrition of healthy cells due to loss of activity over time. Only those body parts and organs that remain active maintain blood flow essential to stay healthy; this purpose is served by regular exercise prescribed for fitness. Sedentary living is known to raise cancer risk especially that of colon or lung or among men and endometrial and breast cancer among women.""Physical activity: even if you don't lose an ounce, you'll live longer, feel healthier and be less likely to get cancer, heart disease, stroke and arthritis. It's the closest thing we have to a wonder drug,"" says Tom Frieden, former director, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Further, acknowledging the limited success of medications, health experts now advise integrated approach including exercise, yoga, vegetarian diet and psychological wellbeing for cancer and other ailments. After positive outcomes from multi-location studies, intake of antioxidant-rich lemon, ginger, turmeric, cucumber, ever part of Indian cuisine, is being advocated for prevention and treatment of cancers.Lab trials at Georgia State University have shown a 10,000 times superior efficacy of ginger and turmeric vis--vis chemotherapy in cancer. Advising reduced intake of non-veg foods, the American Institute for Cancer Research recommends no more than one-third of animal protein in daily diet.Lab studies have also shown efficacy of folate-rich vegetables and fruit, particularly the deep coloured ones which contain cancer-fighting nutrients and help maintain body weight. These include beans, sunflower seeds, green leafy vegetables,green tea, cabbages and tomato and berries. Adequate intake of water and other fluids that dilute toxic concentration of cancer-causing agents in the bladder is also recommended.What makes cancer management tough is the erratic movement of cancer cells and their rapid growth that follows no pre-determined pattern and transmits to other body parts damaging the normal cells. Second, most cases are detected in later stages due to the lack of awareness among people; many women ignore the problem and approach the surgeon only when a tumour has stretched 8-10 cm long.To provide affordable and equitable care, public awareness on cancer along with expanding screening centres needs to be our top priority, says Dr Anand Purushotham, director at King's Health Partners Comprehensive Care Centre. The third handicap in most developing countries is the resource crunch. ""India is spending less than half of what it should be doing on cancer care,"" regrets Dr Anand.Once diagnosed with cancer, those around the patient tend to socially ostracise him/her unfairly at times. Ironically, however, this is a phase when one needs greater moral and other kinds support to accept the condition and pass their remaining days with minimal stress and peace.A patient should be impressed upon, as CC Scott said, that the human spirit is stronger than anything that can happen to it. Small gestures like the presence of loved ones and normal conversations, delivering meals, accompanying the patient to a healthcare facility, supplying essentials, keeping them updated with events and involving them in activities of their liking can trigger positive vibes and facilitate recovery.People diagnosed with cancer should be treated the usual way, with just a little extra love so that they do not lose their morale to fight back against the disease. As Michael Landon, the American writer, stage artist, director and producer said before he died of pancreatic cancer in 1991, ""I'm going to beat this cancer or die trying."""

Keen to ensure that this happens, the government asked NITI Aayog to come up with suggestions. The latter prescribed three alternatives, namely: market assurance scheme (MAS) or price deficiency payments or incentives to private sector to buy farmers produce at MSP.Under MAS, agencies of the state buy the produce directly from farmers at MSP. Under the second option, the government does not buy, but instead it reimburses the shortfall in price realised from sale (albeit in the mandi) vis--vis the MSP. Under the third alternative, the private sector is incentivised to buy at MSP.In the follow through, a group of ministers (GoM) under Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh has approved nationwide implementation of MAS covering 23 agricultural crops, including wheat and rice. The scheme will cover up to 40% of the marketable surplus and cap the price loss (difference between farm harvest prices and MSP) to be eligible for compensation at 25% of MSP.The Union government, apart from absorbing procurement cost in full (roughly 15% of MSP), will bear 100% of the price loss up to 20% of the MSP and half the price loss between 20% and 25% of MSP. The states will share only half of the shortfall between 20% and 25%. Of the overall cost of the scheme, the Centres share would be 93.75% and the states will contribute 6.25%. The states will have to pay for any additional support they wish to give farmers.Though bandied about as a revolutionary step in the overarching mission of doubling farmers income, the expected outcome is doubtful even as the scheme holds dangerous portends for both the Union government and the states via increasing their respective subsidy bills.During 2017-18, the total payment on food subsidy under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) was Rs 1,40,000 crore, including Rs 1,15,000 crore towards excess of procurement price over the heavily subsidised issue price of wheat, rice and coarse cereals (Rs 1/2/3 per kg respectively) for sale through the public distribution system (PDS) and Rs 25,000 crore as incidental cost on storage and handling. Additionally, the government spent Rs 35,000 crore on the price support scheme for pulses and oilseeds, taking the total to Rs 1,75,000 crore.As for 2018-19, according to NITI Aayog, the total cost of MAS is estimated to be about Rs 1,11,000 crore. Of this, the Centre will bear about Rs 1,05,000 crore. Together with Rs 1,15,000 crore being the subsidy to cover the excess of procurement price over issue price under NFSA (same as last year), the total outgo would be Rs 2,20,000 crore. This is an increase of Rs 45,000 crore over the corresponding amount spent during 2017-18. Against the budget allocation of Rs 1,69,000 crore for 2018-19, this is higher by Rs 51,000 crore and will have a destabilising effect on the fiscal deficit.One wonders whether central agencies such as the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and state institutions have the infrastructure and wherewithal to carry out procurement operations on the scale contemplated under the scheme. The experience with similar schemes run in the past for specific crops, such as pulses, oilseeds, vegetables (onion, tomato, etc) scale does not instil confidence. That apart, with the compensation capped at 25% of MSP, besides limiting purchase to 40% of the marketable surplus would still leave farmers dissatisfied.Furthermore, has the government thought through the fate of millions of subsistence farmers who do not have a marketable surplus (they produce food primarily for self-consumption) and a vast number of landless workers who depend entirely on the PDS or market? While they have nothing to gain from the price support scheme, they will be hit by the inflation triggered by it; all the more when the quota for subsidised supply under NFSA, namely five kilos per person per month, is far from being adequate in relation to the need.The responsibility for disposal of the stocks purchased from farmers lies entirely with the states. In order that the state does not suffer a loss on its sale, it should at least realise the effective purchase price (MSP minus price loss support) plus the carrying cost. If it does not  the most likely scenario  then it could suffer loss. This would be in addition to their 6.25% share under the scheme and would be seriously destabilising on the overall finances of the state.The scheme is hugely negative for the finances of the Centre and the states besides for subsistence farmers and landless workers, even as the intended impact (albeit positive) on farmers offering marketable surplus will be seriously constrained by the weaknesses in state procurement, handling and distribution machinery.Policy reforms neededThere is an inherent flaw in the approach. The government is looking for an administrative solution to a problem that requires policy reforms. If the farmers are not getting a good price, it is because the markets for agri-produce are monopolised by intermediaries (in many cases, politicians or their relatives) licensed by state authorities to buy their stuff in designated mandis/market platforms.Even as the consumer pays a high price, the intermediaries/traders pass on only a fraction of it to the farmers. The solution lies in liberating the agri-markets from state controls and giving farmers more options to sell their produce. This can happen only if states bring about legislative reforms such as the abolition of the APMCs (agricultural produce marketing committees). Given that a majority of states are under BJP rule today, it should not be difficult for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to crack the whip.(The writer is a New Delhi-based policy analyst)"

Picture by Pradip SanyalPosta: Nearly 300,000 trucks across Bengal remained off the roads on Monday, marking the start of an indefinite strike against rising fuel price and third-party insurance premium.Supply of fish, vegetables and fruits could be hit, triggering a price rise, if the strike continues for another 48 hours, city wholesalers and retailers said on Monday.The supply of vegetables such as onions, chillies, cauliflower, cabbage and tomatoes is largely dependent on other states, including Maharashtra and Karnakataka, around this time of the year.The bulk of the supply reaches Calcutta in trucks. ""If a truck owner is left with Rs 3,000-4,000 at the end of a Calcutta-Mumbai-Calcutta trip, what's the point in plying trucks?"" Subhas Chandra Bose, secretary, Federation of West Bengal Truck Operators' Association, asked.""Fuel prices have gone up. Premium for third-party insurance has increased by Rs 13,000 to Rs 14,000... so has the salary of drivers and workers,"" he said. ""We will continue with the strike unless a solution is reached.""On Monday, rows of trucks remained parked across parts of Posta, Burrabazar, Dunlop, Sodepur, and along NH2 and Durgapur Expressway even as transport bosses tried to find a way to break the deadlock.Truck operators have been offered a chance to meet chief minister Mamata Banerjee, an official at Nabanna said.Some trucks plied across parts of Garden Reach and Metiabruz, though.""We hope the impasse ends soon,"" a transport official said. ""We have enough supplies. The truck operators had met the chief minister once when bus and taxi fares were being revised. They can meet her again to discuss the matter.""Apart from vegetables and fruits, the biggest concern is fish. The annual demand in Bengal is 1.9 million tonnes.Despite being among the top coastal states in fish production, Bengal has to depend on Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu for fish supplies.Calcutta needs 70-75 truckloads of rohu and katla from Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Odisha daily.""The consumption of fish has gone up following a slump in the meat market because of the rotten meat scare. If the supply is hit, we will face a huge problem,"" a fish dealer in Sealdah said.Truck operators said they had raised the matter of cops demanding bribes during their meetings with the government. ""The chief secretary had assured us that civic volunteers won't stop trucks for money. But nothing hasn't changed,"" `Bose said."

And food is an important part of it. So expect a thali, served on banana leaf, with more than 20 dishes.The staff will be staying over at the restaurant the previous night, in preparation. At 4am we shall bathe, don new dhoti-kurtas, pray and then cook, smiles K. Surendran Nair, the sweet 72-year-old Malayali head chef.Any auspicious occasion in Kerala is strictly vegetarian but you wont miss mutton as you dig into Aviyal (made of papaya, chal kumro, and coconut), Kootu Curry (made of channa, kachkolka, ol and carrots) and Pachadi (a tangy mixed vegetable curry).Since the meal is served on a banana leaf, most items are dry or have a thick gravy. Its just sambar, rassam and a Moong Dal preparation that are watery and will be served on the rice. The chef adds that the Moong Dal preparation is one of the toughest on his list. It uses jaggery and coconut milk and takes two hours to make, he says.Menons personal favourite is the tangy Mambazha mango curry, made of curd, coconut and chilli.The Rs 400 thali will be a lunch-only affair, as is the custom in the southern state, and prior reservations is a must. This part of town has many Malayalis working in the IT sector or studying in institutes like NUJS. They have been making bookings but for Onam we had more Bengalis.

We get ourselves some lebu cha or lemon tea. It is four o' clock in the morning and we are at Galiff Street in north Calcutta's Bagbazar area - the largest pet and plant market of Bengal.The street, according to the Kalikata Street Directory 1915, is named after one Mr Galiff, who was the Collector and Commissioner of Calcutta in 1824. Thereafter, it has been 60 years since the street changed name, but it is still referred to by the name of Galiff of the missing first name.Cold breeze from the Ganges, which flows parallel to the street, stings our faces that morning. Some people are still lying on the footpaths, ensconced in blankets. But the rest of the street is awake and stirring. The market, after all, comes alive once a week, on Sundays. It hosts vendors from all over the state. They start coming in from places such as Durgapur, Asansol, Midnapore - by the night train or bus the pre-vious night. Some arrive on lorries laden with wares.The chaiwala is perhaps not just a chaiwala. He lingers. And then, after a minute's small talk, asks if there is anything in particular that we are looking for. ""Birds, dogs,"" he asks. What about mongoose? Like the Wink Girl whose video is now going viral, his face registers a series of expressions. When he actually opens his mouth to speak again, he says - ""I don't know"" - but doesn't go away either.We order a second round of tea. As he pours it out in style from a height into the transparent plastic cups, it looks a liquid golden thread against the dark. He mutters a statutory warning, ""Police are patrolling the place. If they find such things here, they will seize them immediately."" Then, between furtive glances roadwards: ""You will get your mongoose. Go and check with the ones selling rats."" And before we know it, he has picked up his kettle and disappeared into the darkness.The rat-seller whom we needed to ask for the mongoose is fast asleep, so we decide to stroll around. One stretch is full of colour - dahlias, white, yellow, red and pink; shaggy chrysanthemums, dainty petunias, fifty shades of roses, long-necked Easter lilies, woolly-headed ball lilies, prickly cactuses peeping out of trunks... There are plants growing vegetables - cabbage, brinjal, tomato, cauliflower, green chillies... An undecipherable sweet smell hangs about. In places, however, it is overlapped by the pungent smell of weeds, worms and pesticides. One shop is selling what looks like ugly blobs on plastic sheets. Turns out to be suji poka or worms used in pisciculture.By now it past 5am. A father and son are selling boiled eggs - duck and hen - and generously buttered toast. We ask the man where we can find a mongoose. The response, however, comes from another. This person, too, is setting up shop, putting out to hang from a clothes line, fish and eels in small plastic packets half filled with water. ""You must ask the people who sell birds,"" he says and then abruptly turns his back on us.We pass a stack of empty aquariums, some of them are fancy and come with temperature control, we are told. These makeshift stalls are also selling pebbles used to decorate aquariums. There are seashells, barnacles, rocks.Suddenly the street is awash with soft orange light. Day is breaking in slow motion and heralding it is this mixed chorus of birds. The chirrups are emanating from tempos. One by one the cages are being off-loaded from these.A man is carrying a pole that is overhung with two giant cages segregated into compartments. And in these compartments are the chatterbox birds. Lovebirds, almost 20 of them, huddled together. A pair of cockatiels with proud powdered heads like French Dauphins. White pigeons - a rarity. Mynahs and some birds of the starling family.A young girl stands in one corner of the street with just one green parrot and several empty cages. She has come all the way from Jharkhand. She is saying in her singsong voice, "" Nau sau rup-iya, nau sau rupiya. Khaane seekh gayi hai, koi mehnat nahin hoga, bolti bhi hai."" She is selling the not-for-sale Indian parrot for Rs 900. She is vouching for its grooming - can feed on its own and speak in human tongue, too. And what can it say, we asked. She replies, ""Ram, Ram."" But of course. We keep moving. After all, we have to find the mongoose man.A few steps ahead of the girl, there is a cage with twin birds. They look like the parrot except for a blue patch throat down. The local name for it is neelmohun. ""It is rare,"" says the woman in a green sari, who is minding it.We come across other Indian bird varieties such as the bulbul, the plum-headed parakeet, the common mynah, Indian cuckoo, the Indian roller, spotted dove, kite, grey parrot, macaw, the Indian koel...The Wildlife Protection Act bans the trade and trapping of all indigenous birds, but on Galiff Street you will see Dickensian figures carrying one or more such birds in small netted bags and roaming the market to net buyers. These are, of course, the smaller birds. The bigger ones such as the macaw or grey parrot are available in the bigger shops on the street. Not that they have any better an arrangement. The birds, kept in small cardboard boxes to avoid police glare, often die of suffocation.""Do you sell the lokkhi pyacha,"" another difficult customer making queries. Lokkhi pyacha is the name for the white owl, so named because it is the goddess of wealth Lakshmi's vehicle, according to Hindu mythology. The woman selling the neelmohun does not bat an eyelid. ""Big or small,"" she asks, and then without waiting for a reply rattles on, ""The big ones come at Rs 12,000 a piece. The small ones cost Rs 6,000.""And where would these come from? There are shikaris or hunters who know these things, she changes the topic only to dig herself a deeper hole. ""We can order vultures and kites too,"" she says. They also arrange for home delivery of rare orders. Can we meet the hunters? Apparently we cannot unless an advance payment has been made.The neelmohun woman is from south Bengal's Sunderbans area. She travels for three-and-a-half hours every Sunday morning to sell her wares. There are also some others who come from Bongaon, in the North 24-Parganas. Can we ask the shikari to find us a mongoose? Suddenly, someone seems to have pushed the mute button on her. She points at a shop a few feet away; it is just starting to up its shutters.A middle-aged man is arranging his merchandise - white rats, guinea pigs, red-eyed rabbits. There is no sign of any mongoose. Does he not sell them? He smiles mysteriously and nods. He does not but he can help; it is available.You can also get a hamster. And tortoises, the star turtle or the red ear slider - these are usually kept on display in aquariums. All of it is contraband. And tortoise meat? What about the mongoose we have been chasing all morning? Can he get that or not? That annoying smile appears again. And he replies, ""Come a little later in the day and we shall see."""

Spain is not only a country that has sandy beaches which make it one of the best tourist spots. It is in the possession of rich cultural heritage, architectures that are nowhere less than splendid beauty, festivals that stay peculiar to the country, snow-capped mountains that are yet to be explored and much more. But something that attracts most of the tourists to Spain is its stress-free and relaxed lifestyle. People of Spain lead a life that is hard to find in any country, and you will find uncountable reasons to visit Spain for your next international destinations.Spain should be on everyones travel bucket list for so many reasons, and the best is that there are certain things that can only be found in Spain. The best way to explore Spain in a convenient way is by hiring Taxi. It will be the best way to see even the smallest beauty of the cities of Spain. Though the price will vary from city to city, sometimes it can be 2 to 3 times more to basic fare in bigger countries; a taxi is still the best option. Being a tourist it's troublesome to take a taxi for a good fare, instead, you can get the private transfer in Spain at Kiwitaxi website beforehand.Holy GrailThose practicing Christianity knows the concept of Holy Grail, and every single artwork, be it movies, paintings, books, and others have included the concept. But many dont know that the Holy Grail is located in the Valencia Cathedral of Spain and even the Vatican City, the religious capital of Christianity, has acknowledged it. The artifact stays well-protected in a bay on the wall and people offer their prayers here. Along with this, the Cathedral is famous for the preserved arm of St. Vincent of Saragossa. The place serves as a center of faith for many, and not everywhere you get to the see the Holy Grail.Bull FightingBull Fighting stays synonymous with Spain. All over the world, animal activists have been criticizing the act demanding to ban it, but Spain has no intention of letting go its traditional act. Bull Fighting takes place in all over the country and has been the very part of it for hundreds of years. Though it takes place in many parts of the country, the one being organized in Madrid is the best one, and Seville has the most authentic one sticking to the traditions.Flamenco ShowEvery country has some festivals that stay specific to its border, and out of many that take place in Spain, Flamenco Show is the one. The show is an old traditional form of folk music on which people dance in their own folk choreography. The show has not lost its value and continues to enjoy the same love and enthusiasm as it did when it was started in the 7th century as per the records.Scariest PathwayThis will certainly get into the nerves of adventure enthusiasts. The scariest pathway is located in the small village of El Choro, Malaga, Spain. The one meter wide, the pathway is known as Caminito Del Rey and was inaugurated by Alfonso XIII. 3000 meters long and 101 meters tall, this one will surely send chills down to your spine while you cross it.La TomatinaThis one needs no elaboration. La Tomatina is a festival that receives the maximum number of tourists from all over the world and it takes place in Bunol, a small town. People throw tomatoes on each other and enjoy to the fullest by dancing, eating, and drinking.These are some of those experiences that you will only experience in Spain and it will certainly fill you with happiness."

However, Trump could decide to exempt some countries from any measures, including its NAFTA trading partners and has indicated he might exempt Canada.A Mexican official said the Ross meeting would address Mexican concerns over trade in steel and tomatoes, noting that Mexico would retaliate against steel tariffs.Ross has said he would not be surprised to see countries challenge any steel tariffs at the World Trade Organization.There are concerns that stiff U.S. tariffs could raise global steel prices, which would impact Mexico. While Mexico is a large steel importer, it also exported approximately 4.5 million tonnes in 2016.'HARD TO ACHIEVE'Meanwhile in Mexico City, negotiators discussed the broad outlines of so-called rules of origin, which would have a big impact on the automotive industry.Talks were hampered by the absence of the chief U.S. negotiator, Jason Bernstein, who was unexpectedly called to Washington on Tuesday for consultations and is unlikely to return to Mexico.The possible delay in tackling the matter underlines the slow progress of the talks, which are supposed to wrap up by early April, but look set to drag on for longer.The current round of talks will also focus on closing chapters related to digital trade, telecommunications, technical barriers to trade, good regulatory practices, and sanitary and phytosanitary measures, according to an official with knowledge of the talks.Steve Verheul, Canada's chief negotiator in the NAFTA talks, reported some advances in Mexico City.""We're making reasonably good progress so far,"" he told journalists without elaborating.NAFTA talks have crawled along for the past six months, and Trump has threatened to walk away from the $1.2 trillion treaty unless major changes are made to benefit American interests."

We are looking at compressing the supply chains and creating appropriate climate infrastructure for natural preservation of TOP,"" Badal said.A sum of Rs 500 crore has been earmarked for this scheme.Farmers Producers Organisations (FPOs), agri-logistics processing facilities and professional management will be encouraged under this scheme, she added.Food Processing Secretary J P Meena said the key features of the scheme will mostly likely be ready by April.The vegetable clusters are already mapped in the country and need to work out backward and forward linkages for FPOs keen to take advantage of the scheme, he added.The 'Operation Greens' is similar to the 'Operation Flood' launched in 1966 which was the world's biggest dairy development program of the government."

However the peasantry, which has suffered heavily due to successive droughts and farm commodity price crash in the state, feels let down as the Budget has no initiative to offer relief from the debt burden.Kuruburu Shanthakumar, president of State Farmers Federation, had expected categorical commitment from the Modi government on implementing the Swaminathan Committee report, which Modi had promised to implement within 100 days of coming to power. However, he welcomed the Budget proposal to raise the minimum support price (MSP) of agricultural commodities to 1.5 times the production cost.The proposal is also to extend the MSP scheme to all the 89 crops. It was earlier restricted to 43. He also welcome Kisan credit cards extension to all farmers.Shanthakumar told The New Indian Express that declaring 100 per cent tax exemption for five years for farm produce firms being formed by the farmers is a positive move.Though the Budget has assured huge expansion of crop insurance scheme under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, the scheme itself suffers from many flaws. It needs to be revamped by making a village or farmers the basic unit of reference to pay the compensation instead of the present basic unit of a hobli or gram panchayat.I will give this budget 5 marks on a scale of 10 for the farm sector and will ramp it up to 7 if effective measures are taken to implement the proposals in the remaining one of the Modi government, Shantakumar said.On allocating Rs 500 crore for farmers who grow perishable commodities like potato, tomato and onion, horticulture expert S V Hittalamani said in Karnataka there are some saline agriculture belt which cannot be used for agriculture purposes.However, agriculture experts feel the budget does not help farmers. Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha president Kodihalli Chandrashekar said the budget outlay for agri sector is Rs 11,000 crore. How much of it actually goes to farmers? Whatever money is announced is for the seeds, fertiliser, manure and other facilities. Budget does not speak about loan waiver, he said.He further added that if the Centre can bear Rs 2 lakh crore to implement the 7th pay commission report, why cannot they waive the loan of farmers who are the backbone of the nation."

Initially, AP was synonymous with drought and cyclones. Continuous efforts in the last four years have showcased our resources and strength in various fields and now I am sure the State will register more progress with team spirit, he said, while underscoring the need for more coordination between officials and employees.On the second and final day of the Collectors Conference at his residence in Undavalli on Wednesday, the Chief Minister surprised the officials by describing himself as a team leader and coordinator. Stating that AP has put up a phenomenal performance and displayed excellent leadership, he said the credit for the achievements of the State goes to all.After overcoming all odds initially, we are entering the next level and it is time for all of us to work with more coordination, he said.Explaining about his conversation with former British prime minister Tony Blair as well as the prominent architect Norman Foster, he said on Monday Foster landed in Vijayawada to have a chat with him, while he was en route to Odisha. But, as I am preoccupied with a series of conferences like the Finance Ministers conclave, review meetings and the rally condemning the brutal assaults on girls and women, I could not meet him. After understanding that he could not meet me despite landing here on my own request, Foster decided to go to Odisha. But, after receiving proper information, I not only met him but also dropped him at the airport and had a conversation with him, he said.Naidu said he does not have any individual relationship with Foster. I met him as he is a great architect. In case I did not meet him personally, it would have sent a negative signal about our State at a time when we are in need of support of world-class architects for building Amaravati as one of the worlds best cities, he said.CS makes critical observationChief Secretary Dinesh Kumar pointed out that there will be no use except forcing the closure of the existing industries by allowing more cashew processing industries in Srikakulam district. When Srikakulam District Collector Dhanunjay Reddy sought more cashew processing units, the Chief Secretary said excess processing units are not needed for cashew.Industries Minister N Amarnath Reddy intervened and said that setting up of more processing units will generate employment. But, the Chief Secretary said that more units than the cashew production capacity will only force closure of the existing units.We can understand that there is immediate need for setting up processing units for tomato as the growers in Chittoor district are suffering losses. But, setting up more units for cashew is no way needed, the Chief Secretary said.

Though, some leaders feel it is premature to discuss alliances as there is one more year for elections, others opine that it is better for the TDP to prepare to fight alone. At present, the principal opposition YSRC and the BJP have turned bitter rivals of the TDP. Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan, who stood by the TDP-BJP alliance in 2014 polls, too, is targeting the ruling party and Left parties blame the Naidu government for being equally responsible along with the saffron party for the injustice meted out to the State. Despite Chandrababu Naidus recent meeting with the national leaders of Left parties in Bengaluru, TDP leaders are not sure whether any alliance with CPI and CPM will benefit it or not and they are also not sure on their stand on alliance as they are already sailing with Jana Sena.Against this backdrop, TDP leaders are of the view that they should be prepared to face elections alone instead of depending on alliances. In a brief interaction with TNIE at the venue of Mahanadu, several senior leaders opined that despite the fact that satisfaction levels among people have increased and the CM is confident of retaining power, they will have to be very cautious as there is possibility of all the opposition parties targeting the TDP.A senior leader said the TDPs decision to snap ties with the BJP and leave the NDA government at the Centre helped the party in shifting the blame for States woes to the Centre. If we continued our relations with the saffron party till elections, we may have suffered a lot in the upcoming elections. But, now, by organising a series of programmes, we are hopeful that the people will not bear no more grudge against the State government and, instead, find the BJP and the opposition parties, which are dancing to the tunes of the Centre, as villains, a senior leader said.A leader from North Coastal Andhra explained that at one stage opposition parties managed to convince the people about the guilt of the ruling party in not achieving special category status (SCS) in spite of being an ally of the NDA, by making a big issue out of it. But, after the TDP made the SCS as its main demand and left the NDA, they to some extent understood the TDPs position and its sincere efforts. We are hopeful the people will stand by us without being carried away by the rants of opposition parties. Minister Kalava Srinivasulu said at present the party was concentrating on strengthening its position in the State and will think of political tie-ups only before elections.Mahanadu SidelightsAccording to the 2017-18 fiscal status report of the TDP, which was submitted by party state treasurer and MLA Sidda Raghava Rao, the party has properties with a net worth of J104.15 crore. Its net income in the previous fiscal was J19.40 crore, while the expenditure stood at J16.73 crore. Of the total expenditure, J6.38 crore was spent on publicity, Raghava Rao said. It maybe recalled that a report published by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), last week, said that TDP had the second highest income (in 2016-17 fiscal) among the regional parties after Samajwadi Party. According the the report, TDPs 2016-17 income was J72.9 crore.Heavy traffic jam was witnessed between Benz Circle and VR Siddhartha Engineering College in Kanuru between 9.30 am and 11 am. Even though city police and TDP volunteers were deployed, thousands of vehicles ferrying TDP workers to the venue of Mahanadu sent the traffic for a toss. Beside, indiscriminate parking of two-wheelers and four-wheelers on the road added to the chaos.The first-ever Mahanadu, an idea conceived and implemented by TDP founder the late N T Rama Rao, was held in Vijayawada in 1983 in the 200 acres where Kamineni Nagar, Ganesh Colony, Sri Ramachandra Colony and others have come up now. Mahanadu Road opposite Dr NTR University of Health Sciences, leading to Autonagar has got its name after it was laid to facilitate the movement of vehicles for the first TDP conclave. Two more conclaves were held in the subsequent years. The Mahanadu, which kicked off on Sunday, is the first one since the State bifurcation.Ravva kesari, idly, mysore bonda, tomato bath, tea and coffee were served to the party workers as breakfastw. For lunch, about 20 varieties including apple halwa, Madras pakodi, vegetable biryani, kadai vegetable curry, dondakaya fry, mamidiyaka-aakura pappu, mulakaya-tomato curry, stuffed brinjal were spread out. At 3 pm, snacks were also given. On Monday, which also marks the birthday anniversary of TDP founder NTR, more than 20 varieties of food times, favourites of the late leader, will be served at the venue, according to TDP leaders.The party has put up the model of interlinking of Krishna and Godavari rivers through Pattiseema Lift Irrigation Project at the dais of the venue. The previous Mahanadu held in Visakhapatnam had the models of Polavaram project and Cyber Towers on either side of the dais.Speaking about elections, Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu stressed the need for studying Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs). Technology is always vulnerable to defects. Since we vote only once in five years, we dont have much knowledge of how EVMs work. So, there is a need to create awareness, he said and recalled that he was instrumental in ensuring Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) system along with EVMs.At the blood donation camp, close to 220 TDP workers donated blood. Meanwhile, TDP MP Murali Mohan and K Raghu Ramakrishnam Raju donated Rs 5 lakhs and Rs 20 lakhs respectively for the party welfare."

Last week, forecasts ran as high as $150 million for the four-day haul of ""Solo.""Overseas ticket sales were even worse. ""Solo,"" starring Alden Ehrenreich in the role made iconic by Harrison Ford, grossed $65 million internationally in its opening weekend, including a paltry $10.1 million in China.""Of course we would have hoped for this to be a bit bigger,"" said Dave Hollis, Disney's distribution chief. ""We're encouraged by the response that people have had to the film. It got a good CinemaScore (A-minus). The exits are very encouraging.""""Solo"" came in with a Millennium Falcon's worth of baggage following the mid-production firing of directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who were replaced by Ron Howard. With the rejiggered production, the budget soared well past $250 million.But the cause of the spinoff's disappointing performance may have had as much to do with ""Star Wars"" fatigue (""The Last Jedi"" exited theaters just last month) and the stiffer competition of a summer holiday weekend. While no major releases dared to open against ""Solo,"" Fox's ""Deadpool 2"" moved its release date up a week ahead of ""Solo.""The gambit may have hurt both releases. After debuting with $125 million last weekend, the R-rated Ryan Reynolds sequel dropped 66 percent to second place with $42.7 million and an estimated $53.5 million four-day haul.""Solo"" notched the biggest Memorial Day weekend opening in several years, but it also came on the heels of a pair of a summer-sized blockbusters  ""Deadpool 2"" and Disney's own ""Avengers Infinity War""  making for an unusually crowded May. ""Infinity War"" added $16.5 million in its fifth weekend to bring its domestic total to $621.7 million and its global sales to $1.9 billion  both among the highest of all-time.""It is a business that is built on momentum but also one where people probably are only able to get to theaters a certain number of weeks in a row,"" said Hollis.But there were also questions beyond the effect the calendar had on ""Solo."" While reviews were generally positive (71 percent ""fresh"" on Rotten Tomatoes), there was little about ""Solo"" that made the movie a must-see event.Fans were skeptical of Ehrenreich and uncertain about the dismissal of Lord and Miller (the popular filmmaking duo behind ""21 Jump Street"" and ""The Lego Movie""). Unlike any ""Star Wars"" release before, ""Solo"" was deemed  gasp  skippable.As it arrived in theaters, Disney might have been wishing it had instead made a Lando Calrissian spinoff with the red-hot Donald Glover, the star of TV's ""Atlanta."" In the days ahead of release, Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy said a Lando movie is a possibility.While the original ""Star Wars"" films helped define the summer moviegoing experience, Disney released their previous three ""Star Wars"" films in December. What most hurt ""Solo"" was the ""fatigue factor"" of a May ""Star Wars"" film following a December one, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for comScore.""It's the compressed timeframe between the two 'Star Wars' films and the highly competitive nature of this marketplace. It is summer, after all,"" said Dergarabedian. ""The good news is that the next film isn't until December 2019. That's plenty of breathing space. I think part of the allure of the 'Star Wars' brand in the past has been the long wait.""That time might also be valuable for Lucasfilm and Disney to find a way to counter the diminishing returns of its multi-billion-dollar franchise. To help propel ""Solo"" internationally, Disney brought the film to Cannes Film Festival, flooding the French film festival's red carpet with Storm Troopers.""The Last Jedi"" also flopped in China (it was pulled from theaters after a week), and Rian Johnson's movie  even though it grossed $1.3 billion worldwide  showed relatively weak legs at the box office, while proving divisive among ""Star Wars"" die-hards.The magic around a ""Star Wars"" film may be fading. To right the ship on Episode 9, Lucasfilm has turned to an old friend: ""The Force Awakens"" director J.J. Abrams. He, too, is replacing a fired director after Colin Trevorrow departed last fall.Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to comScore.

I leased a unit and processed fruit. In spite of the initial loss suffered due to lack of quality consciousness among the stakeholders, I went ahead with export. Today, there are 6,200 farmer producers with me, whose net realised value has touched 200%, Mr. Abdul Ali told The Hindu .FPOs distinctionToday, this is the second largest horticultural Farmer Producer Organisation (FPO) in the country, next only to a grape-based unit in Nashik (Maharashtra), he said.After tasting success in mango, Mr. Ali decided to replicate the Nashik example and brought exotic varieties such as seedless grape, pineapple, dragon fruit, grapefruit (a citric variety), passion fruit, and Italian tomato to ensure higher margins for the farmers.We have designed an ERP system to schedule cropping pattern to balance demand-supply, which our farmers are following, Mr. Ali added. This FPO also owns a fertilizer shop that runs on zero margin, thus saving 30% for the stakeholder farmers.Processing unitNow, the FPO is all set to launch a huge processing unit to handle 500 tonnes a day, an IQF facility to make frozen foods, a cold storage that can handle 2,000 tonnes, and pack houses to handle 50 tonnes per day.The profit will be shared among all the shareholders, he said, hoping the unit will come into operation next year."

I have requested assistance from the Government of India for the same,"" he said in a representation made to the Union Minister.To ensure that cooperatives are able to function effectively, the chief minister demanded for increase in the quantum of concessional refinance which National Bank For Agriculture And Rural Development (NABARD) provides from the current 40 per cent to 75 per cent of the ground level disbursement.""This will help us to provide timely and needy credit to small and marginal farmers,"" he said.To ensure farmers get credit at lower rate, the chief minister said that the government should raise the subsidy from 2 per cent to 3 per cent on crop loans for cooperatives.With regard to minimum support price (MSP) of crops, Mr Kumaraswamy asked the Centre to consider C2+FL formula while fixing the price instead of current A2+FL formula.He also suggested the central government to fix MSP for horticultural crops like tomato, onion and potato.Among other demands, the chief minister demanded the Centre to give a special financial package of Rs 2,477.26 crore for losses incurred by arecanut and coconut growers in the state.Coconut has been affected in 1.37 lakh hectare and arecanut in 95,352 hectare and the total loss is pegged at Rs 9,909.6 crore in the state, he added.""The state has prioritised farmer welfare in all its programmes and simultaneously initiated concerted efforts to achieve the goal of doubling farmers income by 2022,"" the chief minister informed in the meeting.The state has been perennially affected by drought with six out of last eight years being declared as drought years and farmers have endured adverse effect of severe successive droughts, he added."

(File)Blaming the previous governments for the state of the pilgrim city, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said he wanted to see it developed as a place with an ancient soul but in a modern shell.Addressing a public rally in Varanasi in his Lok Sabha constituency, he said change was visible in Varanasi over the last four years of his government.PM Modi urged the people of Varanasi to start preparing to welcome delegates from all over the world for the Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas (NRI Day), which will be held here from January 21 to 23 next year.The guests will also visit Allahabad for a 'kumbh darshan'.Earlier in the day, the prime minister had addressed another rally in Azamgarh and laid the foundation stone there for the 340-km Purvanchal Expressway.He will visit Mirzapur on Sunday, wrapping up his two-day visit to eastern Uttar Pradesh.In a symbolic inauguration in Varanasi, PM Modi launched development projects worth nearly Rs 1,000 crore for the city and the region around it. ""A new Banaras is being built for a new India; its soul will remain ancient but the structure will be new,"" he said.While its culture and traditions will remain, the city will have ""smart systems."" He began his speech in the local dialect and chanted 'Har Har Mahadev'.PM Modi condoled the death of at least 15 people when an under-construction flyover collapsed here in May.He said the city was in neglect when the Samajwadi Party was in power in Uttar Pradesh.""Four years back there were overflowing sewers, dangling cables, and traffic jams all over. The road from the airport was in a bad state due to which flights were missed,"" he said.PM Modi said the situation had changed now with cooperation between the BJP governments in the state and at the Centre.""The condition of the Ganga banks was also not good and all the waste used to flow into the river. The earlier governments were not concerned about this,"" he said.He said a large amount of money was earlier wasted in the name of cleaning up the river. The BJP-led government has now taken up the task of cleaning the Ganga from Gangotri to Gangasagar, and sanctioned Rs 21,000 crore for this.He said projects related to roads, transport, cooking gas, beautification, cleanliness and other schemes to help people living here were inaugurated today.""The change Varanasi is witnessing is helping nearby areas and villages. For the farmers, a perishable cargo centre is ready and potatoes, tomatoes and other perishable vegetables can be stored here. Farmers will not have to suffer losses,"" he said.""Whether it is roads or railways, new facilities are being made available for Varanasi. Doubling of track to Allahabad and Chhapra is on,"" he said.New trains will help people from Ballia and Ghazipur to come to Varanasi and return the same day, he added.He praised the Yogi Adityanath government in the state.""Tourism promotion and work on cleanliness and conservation of old monuments are being acknowledged. Swachh Bharat campaign has been taken forward by the UP government,"" he said.He said that impact of the state's industrial policy was also visible now.""The Samsung factory in Nodia was recently inaugurated by me. It will generate job opportunities. Mobile phone factories have increased from two to 120 in the past four years, of these over 50 are in UP,"" he said."

Larry Charles (@larrycharlesism) July 11, 2018The speed with which an ongoing tragedy has been mined for intellectual property, as if it were an old Marvel comic book, might seem distasteful. But it isn't a particularly new phenomenon.- - -""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""The Hurt Locker""One of the most striking recent examples is ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" Kathryn Bigelow's dramatization of United States government's hunt for and eventual killing of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. U.S. forces killed bin Laden on May 2, 2011, in what President Barack Obama called ""the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat al-Qaida."" The movie hit theaters in December 2012, barely a year and a half later.That's a remarkable turnaround time. Bigelow, though, was no stranger to tackling fresh issues. She won six Oscars, including best director and best picture, for her 2008 movie ""The Hurt Locker,"" which followed a U.S. bomb disposal team during the Iraq War. Though the movie was based on accounts of a journalist embedded in Iraq in 2004, it came out while the Iraq War was still underway.""Patriots Day"" and ""Stronger""The 2013 Boston marathon bombing, which killed three and injured hundreds more, was turned into two major, star-driven films.First came ""Patriots Day"" in 2016. The Peter Berg movie depicts Mark Wahlberg as Boston Police Sgt. Tommy Saunders as he searches for the bombers in the attack's immediate aftermath.Though movies based on recent tragedies are often subject to backlash, the reaction to ""Patriots Day"" was particularly fierce - especially in the Boston area. The movie, wrote Boston film critic Sean Burns, was ""as disgraceful an exploitation of real-life tragedy as I've ever seen. Everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves.""The Boston Globe's Ty Burr was slightly more forgiving, calling it ""slickly heartfelt"" and ""vaguely insulting.""A year later, ""Stronger"" hit theaters. Rather than focus on the police response, the David Gordon Green told the story of Jeff Bauman (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), a man who lost his legs in the bombing and was the subject of a famous photo from the day.This one was much more warmly received, perhaps because it was based on Bauman's memoir. It ""rises on the power of its well-chosen ensemble to offer an emotionally resonant fact-based story that transcends inspirational drama cliches,"" reads the critical consensus on Rotten Tomatoes, where it earned a 92 percent ""fresh"" rating.""United 93 and ""World Trade Center""The September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the United States was, by far, the country's deadliest. Perhaps due to this wretched gravity, Hollywood waited a bit longer to cash in on the horror. But cash in it did, with a pair of back-to-back movies. ""United 93 and ""World Trade Center"" were both released in 2006, within four months of each other.The first came in April, and as the title suggests, told the story of United 93 - the hijacked plane heading toward Washington, D.C., that crashed in Pennsylvania after its passengers attacked the hijackers. Paul Greengrass' account was met warmly by critics, but those connected to the actual event weren't as pleased.""It was both excruciating and beautiful at the same time,"" Alice Hoagland, whose son was on the flight, told the San Francisco Chronicle. After Marjorie Kase, who lost three friends in the 9/11 attacks, unexpectedly saw a trailer, she echoed others in telling the paper, ""I don't think the country is ready for this movie right now. We don't have enough perspective or hindsight on the matter.""Just as ""United 93 was coming out on DVD months later, Oliver Stone's account of first responders was hitting theaters amid far more mixed reviews - many of which deemed it exploitative.The World Trade Center attacks are still being mined for the big screen. ""9/11,"" starring Charlie Sheen and Whoopi Goldberg, came out just last year.With each release, it seems, those directly affected by attacks are forced to relieve the horrid day. Bill Doyle, whose son was killed in the Twin Towers, was particularly angry after seeing advertisements for 2012's ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,"" the Tom Hanks vehicle based on a Jonathan Safran Foer novel.""Everybody's trying to make money off 9/11,"" he told the New York Post. ""A lot of families got upset. Why couldn't they warn us about this? I don't think people really realized that these people are really still stressed.""""American Sniper""A year after Chris Kyle -- the deadliest marksman in United States history who had 255 confirmed kills during four tours in Iraq -- died in 2013, the Oscar-winning, Clint Eastwood-helmed depiction of his life (and death) titled ""American Sniper"" hit theaters.Made-for-TV moviesThe timeline also tends to be even shorter when it comes to the made-for-TV movies.

5b540c319855b710b170da6e,A Town  Revered For Its Hams Is Losing A Slice Of History,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/smithfield-a-town-revered-for-its-hams-is-losing-a-slice-of-history-1887511,2018-07-22,,NDTV,"Salted hams are curing in the smokehouse at Darden's Country Store in Isle of Wight County, Virginia.The local charity run is the Hog Jog. The mascot for the wine festival is Pig-o-noir. October brings the Bacon & Bourbon Fest. The town museum promises the ""World's Oldest Ham."" The rescue truck at the volunteer fire department is named ""Hamtown Heavy.""You could say Smithfield is a little obsessed with pork products, but that would understate how deeply hogs are woven into the history and life of this town of about 8,300 on a hill over the Pagan River. So it has come as a shock that Smithfield Foods is shuttering the last smokehouse that produces the area's signature product, the genuine Smithfield ham.""Really? You're going to do this?"" was the reaction of local historian and former Smithfield Foods executive Herb De Groft, 77. ""Country meats are what brought this area to the fore in the 1800s. Word was, the Queen of England used to get one Smithfield ham a year.""The salty, long-cured ham has been an area staple since the English colonists and their hogs arrived at nearby Jamestown in the early 1600s. There is a whole section of Virginia State Code - Title 3.2, Chapter 54, Article 4 - entitled ""Smithfield Hams."" Just as the French define Champagne and the European Union protects Greek Feta cheese, Virginia law dictates that genuine Smithfield ham is cured in Smithfield.Jennifer England stands next to a case of antique hams at the Isle of Wight County Museum.""Anybody can make a ham,"" said Jennifer England, director of the local museum, where pig fanciers can keep tabs on a ham cured in 1902 via the online ""Ham Cam."" ""But a Smithfield ham can only come from within the town itself.""The company has said little about its plans since the Smithfield Times newspaper broke the story about the smokehouse last month. A Smithfield Foods spokeswoman said that the smokehouse had reached the end of its useful life and that the company has plenty of genuine Smithfield hams stockpiled to satisfy immediate demand.""We're currently meeting about the future of the smokehouse and I don't have many details to share at this point. Should know more in the coming weeks,"" spokeswoman Diana Souder said via email.The smokehouse is said to be more than 50 years old, but whether the company will build a new one, seek a change in state law or simply abandon the ""genuine Smithfield"" moniker is a matter of local speculation.Smokehouses once sat cheek by jowl, so to speak, in the little town, but local ham producers have been consolidating for years. Names like Gwaltney, Luter and Todd - a roll call that can make an old Virginian's mouth start to water - were absorbed into the giant Smithfield Foods, which itself was purchased five years ago by the Chinese conglomerate Shuanghui Group, now known as WH Group.An outsider might think selling out to a foreign company would be the thing that set off local alarm bells. But the headquarters remained in a beautiful riverfront complex, the executives are all American, and Smithfield Foods stepped up its involvement in local charities and community events.""Hey, selling to a Chinese company was a very smart move,"" said De Groft, who retired from Smithfield Foods more than 20 years ago. China, he pointed out, is the world's biggest market for pork products.The huge meatpacking plants on the edge of town slaughter more than 10,000 hogs per day. On a hot summer afternoon, the sickly sweet smell of the plants settles on the little downtown, where the most modern houses are Victorian confections and some buildings have been absorbing hog aroma since before the Revolution.""They say that's the smell of money,"" said Caroline Darden Hurt, 75, a retired history teacher whose family has farmed in the area since the 1600s.There is plenty of ham still coming from Smithfield Foods, the world's biggest pork producer. Some of it is even salty - Virginia ham and country ham are generic types produced by many companies. But they are not genuine Smithfield hams.A Smithfield ham is long-cut, with loin attached. Most country hams are short-cut. Old-timers will tell you the curing process - high in the smokehouse rafters over a long, sweltering summer - creates particular amino acids and salt deposits as the moisture disappears from the meat.But it's more than that. It is history and culture in food form. The first English settlers salted hams to preserve them; the Native Americans showed them how to smoke meats. A Smithfield ham is the result of both. Paired with a biscuit, served with Brunswick stew or peanut soup, finished with chocolate chess pie - that's southside Virginia, the sandy soil, the pine trees, the hot, flat peanut fields.Hurt, the retired history teacher, remembers people sharing hams on Sundays. ""Growing up, you could always tell one farmer's ham from another's. There were subtle differences. A ham cured in Suffolk or somewhere else just doesn't taste the same,"" she said.Originally, a hog destined for a Smithfield ham was turned loose on harvested peanut fields to glean the remainders. The peanut oils infused the meat. As hog farming grew in scale in the mid-20th century, though, the requirement that Smithfield hams be peanut-fed was removed from state law.Creating a Smithfield ham takes commitment. The cut hams are coated in salt and left to cure for more than a month; hung in a smokehouse and smoked for up to a week, until the color looks right; then left to hang and age for six months or more.Cooking a Smithfield ham is a ritual of its own, often caught up with Thanksgiving or Christmas memories, the salty meat soaking for a day or more before being washed and cooked and sliced tissue-thin.""The tourists come in looking for it specifically,"" said Leigh Abbott, general manager of the Smithfield Inn, which dates to 1752. ""I think the locals get a little tapped out on it. Though bacon unites everybody.""Across the street from the inn, a genuine Smithfield ham can cost from $150 to $200 at the Taste of Smithfield restaurant and store.Some old-fashioned producers remain in the surrounding countryside. Edwards hams are well-known in nearby Surry County, though a smokehouse fire caused a shortage a few years ago. Felts hams are big in Southampton County.Just outside Smithfield, at a crossroads among the cotton fields of Isle of Wight County, Tommy Darden carries on the tradition at his Darden's Country Store.""My daddy, he [cured hams] most all his life,"" Darden, 71, said. He and his wife keep a smokehouse across the street. They buy fresh-cut hams from Smithfield foods then cure and smoke them by hand.Though he can't, by law, call them genuine Smithfield hams, that's essentially what Darden makes. The short-cut variety that passes for country ham, he said, just can't compare.He's worried about the last smokehouse in town closing.""We're really not sure what that's going to entail, but we think it's not going to be good,"" he said. ""It's something that made them famous, something that put them on the map, something that everybody knows and relates to them with, and it's not going to be here.""Darden has 950 hams hanging in his smokehouse. He salted them in February, hung them in mid-March. They dangle from the dark rafters like props in a Renaissance painting, the surfaces rough with salt, the air pungent and rich. They were ready to cut down and cook on the Fourth of July.With a basket of tomatoes and a basket of ham biscuits on the counter of his shop, Darden said he will never get tired of the salty meat.""I like to eat a chicken salad sandwich with a slice of ham on it and tomato,"" he said. ""To me, that's absolute good."""

As a result, farmers are not getting the desired price for the produce,"" Mistry had said.Mistry further said he had told farmers in the past that the BJP government lacked vision.""Suigam is just 125 kms away from Idar. If you open the border at Suigam, farmers can export many commodities to Pakistan. It will increase trade and eventually benefit farmers of Banaskantha, Sabarkantha and Patan,"" he had said.Responding to Vaghani's barb at Mistry, Gujarat Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi Monday said the BJP leader should first clear his party's stand on the ""invitation extended by the Gujarat government to Pakistan for the upcoming Vibrant Gujarat Summit"".""BJP leaders had promised to teach a lesson to Pakistan ahead of 2014 Lok Sabha polls. But now, their government is spreading a red carpet for Pakistan. The BJP should first explain this sudden change. They owe an explanation to the people of the country,"" said Doshi.After the invitation was extended to Pakistan, office-bearers of the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) had claimed that it was only a ""general circular"" meant for around 285 global trade bodies, and final invitation will be sent only after scrutiny.On December 27, Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation Vice Chairman and Managing Director D.Thara said a Pakistani trade delegation may attend a two-day convention for the MSME (Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises) sector during the upcoming summit."

Of the targeted 1.34 lakh hectares, only 90,000 hectares went for groundnut sowing during the Khariff season, of which less than 40,000 hectares saw harvesting. For the ongoing Rabi crop, the groundnut acreage dipped by about 80%.Paddy too fared badly, with even the eastern mandals that are known for their success stories doing poorly this year due to a prolonged dry spell. Though the target was set at 42,000 hectares in the eastern mandals, the acreage plummeted to half, with low yields.Sugarcane farming received a big jolt in the district due to adverse climate. Generally, the district used to have sugarcane farming in about one lakh hectares, but in 2018 it slipped to below 20,000 hectares. With closure of two cooperative sugar factories and non-remunerative prices for the tonnage, a majority of the farmers resorted to growing alternate crops.Tomato fares betterThe tomato sector fared slightly better, with profits being reported in August and September which took the pressure off an otherwise bleak year that saw yields staying low. During peak season, the Madanapalle tomato market yard receives stocks to the tune of 1,200 metric tonnes per day, with transactions crossing over Rs. 1.5 crore a day. However, the daily arrivals fell below 250 tonnes a day this year.Host of issuesOther predominant issues faced by the farmers this year were an unprecedented shortage of farm workers and a failure of alternative and intercrops. Some small-scale farmers reportedly took up NREGA works and temporarily migrated to Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to make a living as workers in the construction industry.Joint Director of Agriculture Vijay Kumar admitted that the year was disappointing. The major problem was the minus 48% deficit rainfall in the district. However, we are happy that farmers slowly switched over to natural farming.

While speaking during the one-day winter session of Haryana assembly, the CM also announced to include raw potato in the Bhavantar Bharpai Yojana (price difference compensation scheme) from Friday onward.With the announcement of hike of Rs 10 per quintal in the sugarcane prices on Thursday, Haryana has become the first state in the country to increase state advisory price (SAP) for the crop this year as none of the other states had done that so far. Haryana is giving highest price in the country of sugarcane to the growers, the CM claimed.Khattar said that girdawari was being conducted in the state to assess the damage to crop due to hailstorm in different parts of Haryana this month. Compensation on account of damage to crop due to fire had been distributed by the respective deputy commissioners. Letters have been written to all the DCs directing them to give details of the remaining such cases so that compensation could be disbursed to those left out, he added.To remove shortcomings in the girdawari conducted manually by the department concerned and enhance accuracy to assess the damage to crops due to water logging, rain, and hailstorms, it had now been decided to set up an online portal, Khattar said. A farmer would have to give details concerning his crop and area under cultivation on this portal, which would be double checked by agriculture and farmers welfare department and revenue department so that he did not face any problem while getting claims from insurance companies and banks, the CM said.While referring to the Bhavantar Bharpai Yojana, the chief minister said that potato, tomato, cauliflower and onion were now being covered. If any farmers got price less than the minimum support price for these crops, the state government would cover the price deficit for farmers, he said, adding that 18,000 farmers cultivating 48,000 acres had so far register themselves.

The apology came hours after Mahila Congress workers hurled eggs and tomatoes at his residence even as BJPs Mahila Morcha took out a candle march, demanding his resignation.I regret if my remark hurt anyone. My intention was not to hurt the victims family, who belonged to my constituency (Pipili), Maharathy said a couple of days after he had welcomed a local courts decision to acquit brothers Prashant and Sukant Pradhan for want of evidence and said truth has prevailed.Sources said with Lok Sabha and assembly elections round the corner, Maharathys comment could have put the BJD and the state government in a difficult situation, and hence he tendered the apology.It must be mentioned that Maharathy had earlier reportedly tried to shield the rape accused and it is believed the episode had played a role in his removal as agriculture minister in January 2012.Livid at Maharathy backing the acquittal, hundreds of Mahila Congress workers staged a demonstration in front of his residence near Lower PMG here. The agitators tried to barge into the ministers house, leading to a scuffle with the police. The protesters then threw eggs and tomatoes at his residence.In fact, Maharathys apology could not calm Mahila Congress workers, who demanded his resignation. We want his resignation, not an apology. He made a mockery of the victim by welcoming the acquittal of the two rapists, state Mahila Congress president Sumitra Jena said. Bureaucrat-turned-politician Aparajita Sarangi of the BJP said Maharathy should step down for hurting the sentiments of the people with his irresponsible remark. It is surprising that the state government talks of womens empowerment and 33 per cent reservation for women in assemblies and Parliament, but its cabinet minister makes such insensitive comment, Sarangi said.A delegation of BJP Mahila Morcha also visited the victims village and met her family members. We had earlier raised doubt regarding the Crime Branch probe and demanded a CBI inquiry. The acquittal of the accused exposed the sloppy investigation by the state agency. Since the accused are now free, our lives are in danger, the rape victims mother said.Additional director general of police (Crime Branch), Santosh Upadhyay, said the probe agency has initiated the process to challenge the acquittal in the high court. We have asked the director (prosecution) to move the Orissa high court, challenging the acquittal, Upadhyay said."

Many of the students, it added, were left traumatized.The Post launched a database in April tracking incidents of gun violence on campuses since 1999. It found that in 2018, there were 25 cases of school shooting nationwide; a total of 25,332 students were exposed to such carnage; 94 students were shot, among whom 33 were killed and 61 were injured.The 2018 figures in all the above statistics categories set new records in almost two decades. US campuses, as a result, witnessed the most serious devastation brought by gun violence.School systems in every US state and the District of Columbia -- irrespective of demographics or affluence, location or security -- had several lockdowns in the last school year, which ran from the autumn of 2017 to the summer of 2018, the report said.""In fact, on every school day between Labour Day in September 2017 and Memorial Day in May 2018, a campus in this country went into lockdown because of a shooting or the perceived danger of one,"" it said.On February 23, 2018 alone, 33 incidents were reported on campuses all around the country, triggering 67 lockdowns and affecting 50,427 students, a chart in the report illustrated.Children affected by lockdowns during the last school year covered all age groups. More than 1 million elementary-age kids were witnesses of an incident, of whom at least 220,000 are kindergarteners or younger ones, meaning they were mostly under 7 years of age.Experts on childhood trauma said they believe ""a meaningful percentage of"" the affected kids will sustain long-term consequences, including worsening academic and social progression, depression, anxiety, poor sleep, post-traumatic symptomatology and substance abuse.Regardless of how small an imminent threat is, it could be very challenging for school administrators in that they have to respond to the situation in a matter of seconds, the Post said."

You may actually be getting home a lot more than what you had bargained for. A variety of vegetables sold in markets of Hyderabad are laced with harmful chemical pesticides and can pose serious health hazards. At times, the toxic content even exceeds maximum permissible limits.Analysis of vegetable samples in the last one year by the National Institute of Plant Health Management (NIPHM), Hyderabad, revealed that many samples contained residues of about two dozen pesticides. NIPHM collects vegetables from markets and farm gates in the city every month to detect the presence of pesticides, if any.City doctors warned that consumption of vegetables laced with pesticide residue, even within permissible levels, may lead to severe health issues, which includes damage to the kidneys and brain. Human body tends to accumulate pesticides and when it crosses the tolerance limit, severe health problems surface.A study of the NIPHM monthly reports for 2018 reveals the presence of many toxins in vegetables such as tomato, brinjal, cabbage , okra, green chilli, French beans, coccinea, bottle gourd and cauliflower. Some of the chemicals are not recommended, which means they are not meant for human consumption or spraying on vegetables.Senior physician Dr Hari Kishan Boorugu of Apollo Hospitals, Hyderguda, Hyderabad, said each pesticide was associated with different health problems. A little quantity of pesticide may not cause harm, but it creates severe problems in the long term. Organophosphorus pesticides can damage nerves, he said, warning that pesticide-poisoning issues ranged from nerve weakness, muscle wasting to diarrhoea. Often, high doses could cause seizures.In October (latest month for which data is available) NIPHM analyzed 20 cabbage samples randomly collected from markets in Shamshabad and Budvel. Five of the samples were contaminated with residues of Alachlor and Malathion. In September, two of the 25 samples of cabbage collected from Shamshabad, Mehdipatnam and Kothapet contained Pyraclostrobin and Novaluron.Five of the 27 samples of cabbage collected in August from Shamshabad, Mehdipatnam and Dairy Farm showed the presence of residues of Carbendazim, Metalaxyl, Captafol, Thiophanate methyl, Indoxacarb, Novaluron and Ethion. In July, all the 15 samples of capsicum collected from Mehdipatnam and Shamshabad had residues of Acephate, Carbendazim, Imidacloprid, Flusilazole, Tricyclazole, Fenpropathrin, Phenol,4-Bromo-2-Chloro, Bifenthrin and Thiophanate methyl.Twenty samples of capsicum collected from city markets in June were contaminated with nine pesticides. In May, 14 samples of cauliflower were analyzed and 10 of those were found contaminated with six pesticides. Three of the 10 samples collected in April had pesticide residue.

The words describe this festival perfectly and the celebrations are in full swing in my house. The Christmas tree is up with blingy lights and lots of gifts are waiting to be unwrapped. At school, the kids are learning a new carol every day and belting it out proudly at the top of their voices just when I need a moment of peace. And, yes, most importantly, the mistletoe is ready for some loving kisses! For me, Christmas is about good food, wine and being with the people I love.Every person has his or her own way of expressing their love and gratitude. For me its all about cooking and sharing the pleasures of good food with my family and hosting dinner parties for friends.As you can imagine, my kitchen is super busy these days and the alluring aroma of whatever is baking in the oven fills the house, replacing the cold air with a cosy warmth. I have been doing a line-up of dinners in red, white and green. My favourite is this Portobello Mushroom, Baby Spinach And Roast Tomato Quiche in a light wholewheat crust. I serve it with a millet and greens salad for a healthy wholesome dinner.The Mexican Tortilla Lasagne is my take on the overdone Mexican fajitas and tacos. I make it just like a lasagne, but replace the pasta sheets with tortilla wraps and make multiple layers with Mexican black bean filling, fresh spicy salsa and grated cheddar or mozzarella cheese. Cover with foil and bake in the oven at 180C for 20 minutes and a further 10 minutes uncovered. Its delicious comfort food!Making mulled wine and stocking up bottles of it is an annual event at home. It is as simple as slow-cooking red wine with a bit of sugar, cinnamon, star anise, cloves, orange and lemon zest and some vanilla till the flavours have all come together. Aaah, cant you smell it already?Talking of mulled wine, I want to share with you my classic Berry Mulled Wine Sauce recipe. I make a jar of this goodness and keep it in the fridge. Just heat it up and serve over ice cream, cheesecake, panna cotta or simply sandwich it between two cookies for that little bite of indulgence. You can use strawberry, blueberry or any other berry, frozen or fresh.My Spiced Apple Cake is adapted from chef Ottolenghis recipe (you would have seen him on the popular MasterChef Australia last season). So easy to make but so delicious and good-looking. Ditch the classic apple pie and try making this, it definitely makes a humble apple look super glamorous in this glitzy season! Enjoy it as it is or heat it up and pair it with some vanilla ice cream.While we have sorted out the adults with some mulled wine, we need something special for the little elves to drink while hopping around the Christmas tree. Since strawberries are in season now, I created a fun Strawberry Mint Lemonade that is a big hit with my kids. Add in some fresh mint and green lime slices and you have a beautiful pop of colours to fit into the festive spirit. And if you spike it with a dash of vodka or white rum, you have the perfect cocktail.I hope you enjoy making and sharing these goodies. As for me, I am off to southern Italy to celebrate Christmas with my husbands family. And what is it all about? You guessed it, eating, drinking and more eating! Seasons greetings and happy holidays from me to you!Spiced Apple Cake Image credit: Natasha CelmiSpiced Apple CakeIngredients130g salted butter at room temperature150g castor sugar3 eggs, whisked2tsp vanilla essence300g all purpose flour1tsp baking sodatsp salt200g plain yogurtFor the apple mix3 large apples, cut in wedges100g brown sugartsp cinnamontsp cardamom, crushedtsp lemon zestMethodPreheat the oven to 160C.

She had gone to the Khan Market eatery, and enjoyed her chorizo and baby potatoes with wilted spinach and poached egg so much that she had a second helping of the same dish. I am, at present, not on speaking terms with chorizos and other porky products, but still thought Sly Granny deserved a dekko. Then, just a few days ago, we got a call from a dear friend. Were we free to have lunch with her and her daughter (our much loved niece)? The answer to that was pithy: Yes, we said.So there we were in Khan Market one sunny afternoon, looking for Sly Granny. I asked around, and was told to take the middle lane, turning left if we were approaching it from Bahrisons. Sly Granny is on the left, on the first floor. The address is 4, Khan Market, and the phone number for booking your tables (which you should do, because it was rather busy on a weekday, too) is 011-4905 8941.The dcor is pleasing, with nice old-style posters on the staircase and the walls. And on the window sills they have lots of fresh herbs growing, which are added to salads and other dishes, we were told by the helpful servers. Sly Granny, which has a branch in Bangalore, opened in Delhi in August.We asked for chicken salad with walnut and celery  from the small plates section. Our friend wanted fish moilee with curry leave rice and kasundi jhal muri, and the niece, mushroom and black olive tortellini. My wife asked for the roast chicken with garlic mash, asparagus, green beans and win jus and I, the grilled fish. Mine was a Calcutta betki, which is a fish that I enjoy, and the friends moilee was sole. And for dessert, since we were told brie en croute would take some time, we asked for lava cake and affogato.Crispy textureEvery dish was superb. The walnuts in the salad were crunchy, and the chicken had infused in the flavours of celery. The moilee was a bit different, and we had been told that the fish would be crumb fried. So the dish consisted of a little mound of flavoured rice with two pieces of golden fried fish on top, and some sauces on the side. The friend loved it. My fish was delicious, too. It was firm within with a crispy texture and came with a lemon-garlic butter sauce on a bed of lip-smacking buttered and mashed potatoes and topped with micro greens (from the window sill!). I squeezed a piece of lemon over it, and it was like nirvana.The mushroom and black olive tortellini was nice and rich, and had a sauce prepared with basil cream and brown butter and flavoured with sage and toasted pine nuts. I had a bit of the chicken (with garlic mash, asparagus, green beans and win jus)  and thought it was amazing. It had a crispy skin, while the flesh was juicy and tender. We ended our meal with a rich lava chocolate cake served with vanilla ice cream, and the affogato, a nice mix of bitter and sweet tastes.This is a place that is known for its food  its Salmon Gravalax (salmon cured with salt, sugar and dill), pulled chicken tacos with tomato chutney and pickled onions, duck ragout tagliatelle and black pepper salmon. But I know what I am going to go back for once pigs and I resume our happy relationship (happy for me, that is, alas not so happy for the poor pigs). I will have their biscuits and gravy  buttermilk biscuits, pork sausages, sage and bacon gravy.I am counting the days. 10, 9, 8..."
5ce56648e8e3fc56af40bc2d,"Breakfast, lunch and dinner in Melbourne",https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/food/breakfast-lunch-and-dinner-in-melbourne/cid/1679623,2018-12-22,,Telegraph,"Melbourne is a big city with a heart like London and the soul of old-world Australia. The city witnessed a Gold Rush for a few decades, onwards of 1850, and was set to be the next New York, so youll find marvelous remnants of Victorian architecture and ornate lattice-decorated homes alongside a thriving central business district. The centre of the city is all walking distance and is interspersed with restaurants and trendy bars. It is a fabulous city in which to unwind since it has a lively outdoor cafe life, wine bars and the two wine-growing areas  Mornington Peninsula and Yarra Valley, both great weekend getaways and an hours drive away. Meanwhile, here are my 10 must-do things in Melbourne.Collins Kitchen, Grand HyattHave your breakfast here. Grand Hyatt must be one of the best locations for any city hotel and its breakfast is so stunning in terms of quality and variety that you can easily skip lunch that day. It isnt surprising that they have won the Gourmet Travellers Best Hotel Breakfast Award for three years running. A unique feature is the range of fresh juices squeezed on the spot in any combo you want and the smoothies. Anyone who loves Asian food would be delighted with the restaurants wok-and-steamer station (yes for breakfast!). They do all the baking and viennoiserie in-house. Croissants, predictably, are just perfect.Geloso Gelati at Queen Victoria Market, which is spread over seven hectares Image: Karen AnandQueen Victoria MarketSpread over seven hectares, Queen Victoria Market is the largest open-air market in the southern hemisphere. Around 1,000 traders sell everything, from exotic Australian fruits and vegetables, local and imported gourmet foods, meat, fish and poultry to hardware, clothing and authentic Australian artefacts and souvenirs. Its a traditional Victorian structure built in 1878 during the heyday of the citys Gold Rush.The best way to understand how the market operates and a chance to meet some of the third and fourth generation vendors is to enroll for the Ultimate Foodies tour. I had Carmel guiding me around and she was a wealth of information, plus the exercise allowed me to taste without feeling embarrassed. Merchandise is removed from the stalls at the end of each trading day. It is a reflection of the eating trends in the city today with a lot of organic produce, kangaroo and game and a huge range of smoked meats, olives and cheese. It is also home to new and upcoming eateries and food concepts like the one I stumbled upon, Geloso Gelati.Queen Victoria Deli is a hidden gem of the food and cafe scene Image: Karen AnandHidden Secrets tourI thoroughly enjoyed the Hidden Secrets tour with Fiona Sweetman. I enrolled on the Cafe Culture walk but Fiona was flexible enough to take me to some of Melbournes designer shops, point out some hip and happening rooftop bars and have a great cup of coffee in the bargain. Diverting from the main drag of coffee-lined laneways, the Cafe Culture walk takes you on a tour of Melbournes hidden-away food and cafe scene, meeting people who are passionate about tea, coffee and food. Most importantly, you discover places you would never have found on your own and get a real taste of Melbournes unique flavour. They also do history and architecture walks and a progressive degustation for hardcore foodies.Chin Chin, a wacky Melbourne eatery Image: Karen AnandLunch at Chin ChinA breath of fresh air on the Melbourne eating-out scene, this is a wacky Melbourne eatery down Flinders Lane. The staff are young and perky and the food pretty amazing. Must-try items are the Barramundi and Crispy Pork Salad, the most amazing Tom Yum Soup I have had in a long time and the Jungle Curry with Steamed Fish and Diamond Clams. If youre uncertain of what to order, just go for the Feed Me#1 where they give you a selection of their favourite dishes until you say no more. Theyve also produced two very good cookbooks. I highly recommend Chin Chin, the cookbook.Pellegrinis is a must if you want to understand the history of Italians in Melboune Image: Karen AnandCoffee and strudel at Pellegrinis Espresso BarHundreds of Italians immigrated to Victoria in the late 19th century and then after World War II when many agricultural workers from southern Italy chose to settle down in Victoria to escape the economic hardships back home. The area around Bourke Street in central Melbourne is where many of them started small businesses, restaurants and coffee shops. Pellegrinis Espresso Bar started in 1954 as an espresso bar with, reportedly, the first espresso machine in Melbourne. Twenty years later, two friends, Sisto Malaspina and Nino Pangrazio, bought it over and continued the tradition, keeping the same menu and decor. Pellegrinis is a Melbourne institution. The iconic espresso bar serves authentic Italian food and, of course, fantastic coffee. I first discovered it when my son was studying there. It was the favourite for hungry students and it wouldnt be uncommon to be invited by the owners to share enormous bowls of spaghetti with tomato sauce or lasagna drooling with cheese. Pellegrinis is like stepping back in time and a must if you want to breathe and understand the history of Italians in the city. The Apple Strudel is to die for. The cafe is now listed by the National Trust of Australia.Attica's brilliantly thought-out 17-course tasting menu is worth every penny Image: Karen AnandDinner at AtticaIts best not to say too much about the award-winning, much-talked-about, hard-to-get-into Attica. Ben Shewry has been making waves on the Australian eating-out scene for several years now. Attica was recently awarded number 20 in the world on the prestigious Worlds 50 Best Restaurants list (prepared by the UK media company William Reed Business Media).My expectations were high as I took a taxi on the 40-minute journey from central Melbourne to an eastern suburb called Ripponlea to eat at one of the most-sought-after restaurants in Australia.There is a three-month waiting list to get a reservation and I arrived promptly at 6.30pm. I was squeezed in after much persuasion. Mindfully sourced, Australian flavours and produce (marron, finger lime, kangaroo and abalone), skilful cooking and a lot of intellect goes behind his food. Ben Shewry spending more than half an hour chatting with me appeared shocking when one considers the evening he had ahead of him. It is a brilliantly thought-out 17-course tasting menu only and at Aus $295 without wine is worth every penny.Cruffins at Lune Croissanterie, a current rage Image: Karen AnandLune CroissanterieTaking the city by storm is Lune Croissanterie in the old neighbourhood of Fitzroy. Their new branch, right opposite Grand Hyatt on Collins Street, is testament to their ever-growing queues. This is an Australian version of the famous French croissant in many new avatars. Although they claim their plain croissant is the bestseller, you must gorge on the Lemon Curd Cruffin  a cross between a croissant and a muffin, almond croissant  and their savoury Ham and Gruyere. A great way to start the day!Mosaic floors and an arched glass skylight at 19th century Block Arcade Source: Karen AnandBlock and Royal ArcadesThe opulent 19th century Block Arcade with the iconic Hopetoun Tea Room and the Royal Arcade with a great little chocolate shop called Koko Black complete my shopping experience in the city. The Block Arcade, part of the Golden Mile heritage walk, is blessed with original stained glass windows, mosaic floors and an arched glass skylight. There are a number of independent Aussie retailers, including Creswick Woollen Mills, Alpaca Collection and Beechworth Honey. Similar in style is Royal Arcade, the oldest arcade in Australia. While youre shopping, check out Gaunts Clock, where mythical figures Gog and Magog ring the chimes every hour.The iconic Hopetoun Tea Room Source: Karen AnandAesop body careI was introduced to this local bath, body and skin care brand when I first visited Melbourne almost 20 years ago. I am so happy that it not only survives, its thriving and has several branches in the city and all over Australia. The brands shops look like Victorian apothecaries with modern design and functional brown bottles. Its like a thinking, 21st century version of the Body Shop. Products I buy there include the geranium leaf body balm and hydrating body treatment oil, hand creams and hydrating cream for stressed skin. The products are made from natural botanicals, so they are safe and pure and smell delicious. Ingredients are all declared on the packaging, unlike a lot of expensive cosmetic brands, and the staff is very well informed. By the way, its all reasonably priced.A collection of Australian and imported cheese presided over by Victor Persinette Source: Karen AnandSpring Street GrocerThe deli and the juice bar here is a great place to buy and see gourmet products. I also discovered a little secret air-conditioned cheese shop and tasting room downstairs, which has an amazing collection of Australian and imported cheese presided over by Victor Persinette.Karen Anand is a culinary consultant, food writer and entrepreneur.

5ce56975e8e3fc56af40be11,Waiter  there’s bacteria in my salad!,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/waiter-theres-bacteria-in-my-salad/article25793741.ece,2018-12-21,,The Hindu,"Heres some unpalatable news. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are hiding in your food, not just in the meat, and fish, but also in your tomatoes and apples. Thats right. Samples of raw food lifted across Chennai have tested positive for colistin-resistant bacteria, conforming to a global trend.A paper in the Journal of Global Antimicrobial Resistance by a group of researchers from Apollo Cancer Hospital, Chennai, and Christian Medical College, Vellore, carried out the survey in one city alone, lifting samples from 22 locations  shops and homes  between October and November 2017; 46.4% of the samples were found to harbour the highly-resistant bacteria.Last resortLead author Abdul Ghafur, of Apollo Hospitals, said: In the practice of medicine, colistin is called holy water. Its the last resort for very sick patients. Colistin resistance is already a problem in clinical practice, now we have established food origins in India.Globally, there are many publications outlining the route of transmission of colistin resistance via the food chain. So, frankly, when we found the colistin-resistant bacteria in our samples, we were not surprised at all, Dr. Ghafur explained.While handling of produce could play a role, the main cause of contamination in fruits and vegetables is a spillover from the poultry industry. Colistin is used as a growth factor in poultry, and poultry litter is used as manure in agricultural fields.Eating such contaminated food every day will allow the resistant bacteria to invade the human gut, rendering the host resistant to the powerful antibiotic Colistin, in case he/or she were to develop an infection.Undoubtedly, cooking the food will kill the bacteria. But, meanwhile, the food has already contaminated the surface in the kitchen, and people who handle the food have also been exposed, researchers said.Colistin is used extensively as a growth promoter and India has no regulations to prevent this practice, though many European countries have banned the use of colistin in poultry, the paper says. The Chennai Declaration of medical societies in India and National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance plan have made recommendations to ban the use of antibiotics as growth promoters."

The entrance which was turned into a dumping spot years ago, continues to overflow with waste every day. Not a thing has changed about the facade of the market except that more stakeholders dump garbage here now, says S. Saravanan, a vendor.Thayir Market, as it is referred to by the public, is at least 60 years old, say the vendors. What first started off as a fish market later saw the sale of fruits, dairy items and later vegetables.It is one of Madurais oldest markets, Mr. Saravanan says, and there is history in each of its corners. Currently, there are 152 shops at the market selling a variety of vegetables. This centrally located market also falls under the area of development zone of the Smart City Mission. A number of issues plagues the market and its surrounding areas, says S. Deepalakshmi, a tomato vendor.At least 100 trucks frequent East Marret Street to deliver a variety of items to the vegetable market and to the wholesale markets nearby. This creates extensive traffic in the area and leads to commotion as there is no proper pedestrian crossing. The quality of roads is poor too, she adds.R. Annapechi, who has sold vegetables at the market for 40 years now, says though the market now has asbestos sheet instead of thatched roofs, the smell of piling garbage has worsened with time.I cannot eat or sit in my shop because of the hideous smell. Some say they get used to the smell with time, but I have not. The market is in its worst condition during monsoon time, she adds. We can now see pelts and waste parts of slaughtered goats dumped into the bins. The hotels nearby also throw their waste here, she says. What began as one bin has now become three, says K. Ammaiappan, a functionary of Centre of Indian Trade Unions and a vegetable vendorMs. Deepalakshmi says there are no proper toilet facilities for women inside the market. The toilet inside the market complex is dysfunctional, she adds.The vendors also say the composting bins kept by the Corporation inside the premises have not been useful. Mr. Saravanan and P. Kaniraja, both functionaries of the CITU, say it was used only for one week by vendors. No crackdown was conducted on its usage after the initial enthusiasm expressed by the civic body in 2017, they add.Corporation Commissioner S. Aneesh Sekhar says the civic body was planning to instal 10 underground bins as part of the Smart City Mission plan.Thayir Market has been chosen as one of the locations, he adds."

Those rescued had been brought to the plantation in Dudda hobli, and been forced to work in extremely poor conditions. The rescued labourers were subsequently housed in a school nearby on Monday morning.The plight of the labourers came to light after one labourer, 50, a native of Chikkamagaluru went missing from his home. His son initially filed a complaint in Chikkamagaluru,before lodging one at the Banavara police station, where he had relatives, seeking assistance in tracing his father. While the cops went on the 50-year-old mans trail, the son started searching for his father in parallel. At Arasikere junction, a few miscreants allegedly tried capturing him, but he evaded them and lodged a complaint at the Dudda police station.Acting on this information, a team of police officers led by superintendent of police (SP) Prakash Gowda raided the plantation in Savanthahalli around 10pm on Sunday. While 32 men and 16 women were forced into labour, cops also found four children, belonging to some of these labourers in the sheds.Police said that the plantation was owned by Krishnegowda, a resident of Bengaluru, who had leased it out to Mounesh aka Murali. Along with his associates Basvaraj, Pradeep and Nagraj, Mounesh allegedly lured those looking for jobs across the state on the promise of high wages, but turning them into bonded labourers later.Police said that some of the people in the plantation had been working as bonded labourers for the past three or four years. Those running the farm allegedly restricted the movement of the labourers inside the farm, and housed them in temporary sheds, besides subjecting them to torture . The labourers were also taken to other farms in Nittur, Gandasi, Chikkamagaluru and Sakleshpura, where they were made to plough, plant, harvest and spray pesticides, police said.One of the rescued labourers, Vijay, a native of Chikkamagaluru, explained how the accused trapped helpless individuals such as himself. They wait near the Arasikere Railway Junction, and approach daily wage labourers like myself, promising us wages of up to Rs 500 per day and three free meals for loading tomatoes on to trucks. Once we are hauled into vehicles, we are brought to the plantation and confined here, Vijay said.Recalling the harrowing ordeal, another victim Ramesh said that the labourers would be beaten with iron rods when they demanded wages. Ratnamma, a native of Haveri district, said that the children, all of whom were aged below 12 were fed once in the morning. I returned to the shed only at 9pm, when I would cook their dinner and feed them. They would be given nothing in the interim period, said Ratnamma.The rescued labourers are being housed at the Morarji Desai School in MD Hosur. They will be sent back to their respective homes after a medical checkup camp is held under the supervision of officials of the public works department, police said.SP Gowda said that they had arrested Mounesh, and seized five of his vehicles including a tractor and bike. We are also looking for the others involved in the crime, who eluded us when we carried out the raid, said Gowda.- (By Darshan BH)"

With the deadline fast approaching, the demand for alternatives for these pollutants is on the rise. We speak to a few entrepreneurs who have beenproviding alternatives to disposable plastic...It is said that plastic toothbrushes can turn extremely toxic when they start decaying after centuries. So, why leave more carbon print in the over- polluted earth, asks G Venkateswaran of Nature Village, Erode. Our toothbrushes are made of bamboo and the bristles are made of corn fibre or charcoal. We believe in living in harmony with nature. We provide organic cotton, non-violent silk and natural dyes obtained from fruits, seeds and flowers and roots. Some of the interesting additions are fibre seats, seat pads, pillows, banana fibre, clay water bottles, bamboo key chains, bamboo straws, bamboo sets and bamboo shaving razor. He adds, The car seat pad and pillows are filled with banana fibre yarns, pure cotton and vettiver. They are covered with cotton cloth and non-hazardous ink. We have cotton sanitary pads and diapers, organic liquids and cloth wash as well. Though the awareness among people is still low, its gradually increasing, especially among youngsters.Marutham foods and Natural Products from Palani offers bio-degradable plates, bowls, trays and lid, made of sustainable natural resources including corn starch. They are sturdy and suitable for hot, wet and even oily food. They are fit to be used in microwave oven or kept inside the refrigerator. They degrade in a short period and are fully compostable. The important fact is that they do not impact the colour, odour or taste of the food. They do not leave any chemical residue, says one of its representatives.When you step out of home next time, dont forget to carry a bio-degradable bag. Ecofora of Regeno Ventures has come out with bio-degradable bags, primarily made of tapioca starch and natural additives. These bags are hundred per cent plastic free and can be recycled after use. We have different varieties of bags  seat covers, shopping bags, carry bags, medical bags and garbage bags. They decompose in 150 days, do not leave toxic residue and are eco-friendly. They are also dissolvable in high temperature. The polythene bag, on the other hand, remains in the landfill for more than 500 years, says R Soundharya, distributor in the Coimbatore region.Tucked away at a residential colony in Saibaba Colony, Coimbatore is Eco Green Unit, which delves into the concept of creating wealth from waste. Discarded banana fibre, coconut shells, areca palm leaves and kora grass have been given a new lease of life by converting them into spoons, plates, glasses, boxes, trays, yoga mats, floor mats, soap trays and pots. Some of these products are not only bio-degradable, but can also be converted into manure. Its founder SK Babu says, Our unit is located at Madhampatti village, near Siruvani in Coimbatore. We provide training in making areca leaf products, mat weaving, coir pot making and paper bag making. Eco plates and cutlery are healthy and hygienic and are great alternatives to plastics. They are biodegradable and eco-friendly. The pots made of coir can be used in gardening, landscaping and water conservation.Its time to go eco-friendly with stationery at work. Coimbatore-based Papcil has come out with pencils made of recycled paper. We source our raw material from factories and churn out pencils from them. The highlight, however, is the seed pencil. A seed is placed inside a gelatin capsule attached to the pencil. We have seeds of 13 varieties that comprise vegetables like tomatoes and chillies and flowers like marigold. Since the seeds do not last long when kept inside a gelatin capsule, we cover it with coir pith. This can last up to six months. After using the pencil, all you need to do is throw the seed into the soil and water it, says Gowtham Prasath, its founder.Disposable diapers and sanitary napkins take many years to decompose and remain in the landfills for a long time. Thats why Pollachi-based Dhivya Sidharth introduced reusable cloth diapers called KiddieHug. Cloth diapers are water-proof, leak-free, chemical-free, easy to use and one size (customisable for kids weighing 4-17kg). The reusable cloth diapers can be used from birth until the kids get potty trained. These diapers come in attractive colours and the babies need not wear anything over it. They are made from natural fibres like hemp cotton and bamboo cotton. Instead of disposing the diaper after single use, one can wash and reuse it. Mano Sathya Selvaraj, who has her own brand of cloth diapers called Apple Blossoms, says that cloth diapers are not just easy on the environment, but on the baby and wallet as well. She says, Bamboo cotton absorbs water easily. Our diapers come in two sizes  newborn and one size. We provide inserts with microfibre, hemp, charcoal bamboo and bamboo cotton. The diaper wet-free bags can be used to hold soiled and unuseddiapers."

So, if you dont like what you hear from me and if you have rotten eggs and tomatoes, please raise your hand!The green checkered gamchha (a coarse cotton towel) that he wears like a badge of pride today has been a significant part of this 68-year-old man  be it as a teenager sleeping rough at railway platforms, using it to fling bricks at adversaries during the Naxalite movement in the 70s, or to wipe his sweat as a rickshaw-puller ferrying people around south Kolkata. It is a part of my identity. I may be among tie wearers, but the gamchha keeps me rooted, helps me represent the class I belong and still trying to belong and survive.Byapari made quite an impression with anecdotes spanning his days as a child of Bangladeshi immigrants living in camps; as a rebel thrown into prison that he calls university because that is where I learnt to read and write with a stick on the ground and which sheltered me from the fear of being run over by cars or dying due to a lack of access to medicines; and his providential encounter with the late writer Mahasweta Devi , who discovered and shaped the firebrand author that Byapari is today.Although a staunch atheist, Byapari believes it was his fate that turned his life around when the lady passenger he was ferrying on his rickshaw was intrigued by his quest for the meaning of the Bengali word jijibisha. Will to live, she explained, before scribbling her name and address on a piece of paper that read Mahashweta Devi, who went on to publish his writings in her journal Bartika.Today, Byapari, who has authored close to a dozen novels and over a hundred short stories, and has been given awards for his work, lives on the southernmost fringes of Kolkata, where he cooks midday meals for students of the Helen Keller Badhir Vidyalaya for the deaf and the blind every day, unless he is advocating for Dalit rights or hopping Litfests.Im grateful for where I am today. But theres one thing that saddens me. Im invited to events where I get to choose from 150 kinds of roti, and a days rate for my hotel room is more than what I can afford to pay as house rent for a month. If people spared a thought for the condition people like me live in for the rest of our 364 days, it would make my writings, and days spent in jail, worth it! he signed off."

The scheme is implemented by the Union Food Processing Ministry, that has a corpus of Rs. 500 crore and aims to aid farmers in times of price fluctuation in tomatoes, onions and potatoes. The State is considering seeking transport subsidy for onion growers to sell especially stored onions in consuming States and working on ex-gratia grant to compensate affected growers.Onion prices have come under pressure because of the arrival of stored onions as well as fresh kharif crop. The wholesale price for stored onions is lower owing to poor quality, while the kharif crop is fetching around Rs. 10 per kg, as per official data.In November, 50% of the onion that arrived in wholesale mandis in the State comprised stored onions. The price quoted was between Rs. 3.50 and Rs. 4 per kg, which has created unrest among farmers, a source said.There is higher quantity of stored onions in the State as farmers had increased area under the crop during the 2017-18 rabi season in anticipation of better prices, the source said."

A camera focusing on the kitchen, where the tomato bath that was served as prasadam to the devotees was prepared, is also dysfunctional, much to the cops chagrin.Police pointed out that the temple premises are mostly uninhabited in the evening, and as evidence of the tragedy having been an act of sabotage mounts, cops said that miscreants may have been up to some mischief at that time. Had this been a case of just food poisoning, we would not have seen the effects as immediately, nor would they have been so severe. In this case, reaction to the prasadam was immediate. All those who had the tomato bath were seen writhing in pain near the kitchen, a police official said.Shankar, one of the priests at the temple, said that nearly 15kg of rice was used to prepare the tomato bath, which was to be distributed among them and the devotees. It was for a special occasion since the foundation stone was laid to build the temples gopuram . But, some devotees arrived early, and we served them food, deciding to eat the same at a later time. But fate had something else planned, said Shankar.Chamarajanagar superintendent of police Dharmendra Kumar Meena told STOI that a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder had been registered against thus far unknown miscreants. We have launched a probe, Meena said.Kollegal deputy superintendent of police Puttamadaiah, who is heading three investigation teams constituted to probe the incident, said that they were quizzing many people, and that it was too early to state anything conclusively since cops were awaiting reports."

Dozens of devotees are in hospital and 10 are on ventilator. Hundreds of crows dropped dead soon after eating the food.Police said preliminary investigations said pesticide was mixed in the food served to devotees. CM HD Kumaraswamy called it a case of sabotage and said miscreants had poisoned the food.Kichchugatti Maramma temple is in Sulvadi village along the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border.

The cool weather and all this love and happiness around calls for some warm, cosy food. For me, its all about hearty one-pot hot dishes for the family to share.I love the flavours from the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern kitchens  simple, fresh ingredients cooked with bags of flavour. My culinary philosophy emphasises on cooking with local seasonal produce. There are beautiful pumpkins, carrots, oranges and greens in the market these days and there are so many innovative ways to prepare them. Roasting vegetables and meat in the oven is a great way to cook as you dont have to keep hovering around the stove. Also, the nutritional value remains intact and you get a lovely smokey-charred flavour.Here are some of my current favourite Mediterranean winter dishes that you must try making soon. They are vegetarian but you could add some grilled chicken or fish to them. Alternatively, enjoy them as an accompaniment to your meat or seafood dish.Roast Pumpkin, saffron and orange soupA boring pumpkin soup gets transformed into an orchestra of flavours.Ingredients: 2tbsp olive oil, one onion (cut in wedges), 500g pumpkin (cut in wedges), 1tbsp chilli/sriracha sauce, 5-6 saffron strands, zest of one orange, 500ml (or more) water,  cup coconut milk (or cream), salt and freshly-cracked pepper,  cup pumpkin seeds (toasted), chilli flakes, 2tsp honey/date syrup, fresh coriander/parsleyMethod:Preheat the oven to 220 degrees Celsius.

I ran my hand along the leg and found that there was a very tender lump. There is agonising pain whenever I touch it.This is probably a trigger point  an area where the muscles and nerves have tangled up. It needs to be released. You can do this yourself by massaging it with your thumb. You can also apply ice for 10 minutes, rubbing it in a circular motion. You can use a foam roller to massage out the pain.You can go to a physical therapist who will use a non-invasive device like an ultrasound to remove the trigger. Triggers tend to reform. Stretch the muscles regularly to prevent this.Diet woesI am overweight and feel guilty about it. I diet and exercise. I do manage to lose some weight, only to regain it all and then some more.When you diet and starve your body of calories, the brain signals that you are hungry. Immediately, you crave simple carbohydrate snacks, sweets and chocolates. The blood sugar level spikes and you feel satiated. Unfortunately the tendency is to do this repeatedly at ever shorter intervals. That contributes to the weight gain.You could eat a fruit, a carrot or a raw tomato if you are hungry and steer clear of the carbohydrates. That way your hunger pangs may be temporarily satisfied.How much exercise?I am 60 years old and I retired a few months ago. I walk 30 minutes a day. Is that enough?It is good that you are walking. Try to reach your target heart rate. This is calculated as 80 per cent of 220 minus age. Muscles tend to waste as you grow older, so you also need to do weight training at least three times a week using light weights (2-kilo dumbbells). Stretches and yoga prevent stiffness brought on by increasing age. If you do all this, your balance will remain good, muscle and bones will be healthy and falls will be prevented.Stubborn babyMy one-month-old baby refuses to feed at my wifes breast. Should we start bottle feeds?Babies have a rooting reflex. If you touch the side of the cheek with the nipple or the tip of your finger, the baby turns its head and latches on. If you try to force the nipple into the mouth, the baby will reject it.Avoid beansI feel bloated, my stomach hurts, and I pass embarrassing amounts of gas.This may be due to your diet. You may be able to reduce it if you eat fewer beans and carbohydrates. Also, avoid aerated beverages. Drink plenty of plain water, at least three litres a day. Eat at least 2-3 fruits per day and cultivate regular bowel habits.Morning sicknessMy daughter is pregnant, and she vomits eight to 10 times a day. It is tough to watch.Vomiting during pregnancy may occur because of a urinary tract infection or for no reason. The obstetrician will be able to sort this out. There are a few simple manoeuvres to help. She could walk for a half hour morning and evening in the fresh air on level ground. She could leave the kitchen area when food is being fried. She could have acupressure performed on her wrists for 20 minutes every morning and evening. She could also give up food and eat only vanilla ice cream for a day. For some mysterious reason, it helps some women end vomiting. If all this fails then tablets may be required.The writer is a paediatrician with a family practice at Vellore and author of Staying Healthy in Modern India.

It has also started making puree from juicy vegetables like tomatoes and other local fruits like guava, banana and sapota (chickoo).Starting from mango pulp to dried chickoo and all types of frozen vegetables, the South Gujarat region has it all. All types of vegetables and fruits, including their variants, could form a rich export market for gulf countries, the US and UK, earning more than Rs 1,000 crore in the next five years. On the other hand, shrimp farming in South Gujarat has gained prominence over the last decade with export potential of more than Rs 900 crore. Majority of the shrimp export is done from Mumbai and South India ports.Aquaculture expert Dr Manoj Sharma told TOI, For fresh shrimp supply to Gulf countries, an international air cargo in Surat will be a blessing. However, the biggest boon will be on domestic front as we get more than 400 crore shrimp babies from Pondicherry via Vizag and Chennai. These shrimp babies arrive in Mumbai and then reach parts of Gujarat, including Surat and South Gujarat, via road.APMC, Surat, chairman Raman Jani told TOI, We have set-up the production plant with an intention to boost local farmers income and earning foreign exchange for the country. At present, not many farmers have APEDA licences, but they can go through us and still reap the benefit of exporting their products. We hope Surat international air cargo will go a very long way in establishing South Gujarat as a major agro product export market."

From chopping to deep frying, we tend to cook all the goodness out of food. There are, however, ways we can retain nutrition without compromising on taste. Heres how to go about it.Chop, chopThe usual process of preparing vegetables for cooking is to peel them all  even the ones that dont need it  cut them into small pieces and soak in water. This removes dust, grime, pesticides and added colours. It also removes about 40 per cent of vitamins B and C.Proper cleaning is absolutely essential to get rid of toxic substances, even if you lose some nutrition in the process, says skin specialist Dr Sanjay Ghosh. The added colours and pesticides are poisonous and can cause severe disorders. Dr Ghosh suggests that vegetables be washed thoroughly in running water or soaked before chopping so that the nutrition is not washed out along with pesticides. They should then be cut in large pieces and cooked quickly. Peeling vegetables is not necessary as peels have fibre and nutrition. These fibres are good for people with diabetes, high cholesterol and too many fat deposits, Dr Ghosh adds. Peel the vegetables thinly so that you can save some fibres and nutrition while getting rid of toxic chemicals.Smoking hotMost people cook in smoking hot oil but this process is incorrect. All cooking oils have a specific smoke point  the temperature at which oil molecules break apart and give off smoke. That is also when the beneficial fatty acids and vitamins go up in smoke and a host of harmful free radicals are produced. Free radicals cause inflammation that leads to high cholesterol, heart diseases, stroke, Alzheimers, cancer and many other disorders. Forget eating, even being exposed to this smoke while cooking is dangerous, especially for those who suffer from asthma and allergy.To protect yourself, heat the empty pan first. Then pour in oil, heat for a few more minutes and add the ingredients before the oil gives off smoke. Cover the pan and cook on low heat.Deep friedPuri, kachauri, pakoras, chops  Indian cooking has an array of deep fried dishes. Regular consumption of them may lead to obesity, which is linked to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, stroke and heart disease.Apart from free radicals, smoking hot oil also produces trans-fats, which raise the level of bad cholesterol and the risk of cerebral stroke. If you recycle oil used for frying, you create aldehyde, an extremely harmful organic substance that leads to a host of disorders including Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease. So should one throw away oil left over after deep frying? Well, it depends on the smoke point of the oil. Safflower, canola, mustard, sesame and coconut oil dont disintegrate at moderately high temperatures. If you fry at moderate heat  and not extremely high heat  then you can reuse them. Strain the oil once cool to get rid of burnt particles (harmful organic substances) and recycle. But if the oil looks turbid instead of clear, throw it away.Incidentally, coconut oil is one of those rare oils that has a high smoke point. This means you can safely use it for deep frying. Unfortunately, while popular in southern India, coconut oil is not accepted as a cooking medium in the rest of India.Choose shallow frying [like a paratha] over deep frying. This is not crispy but tastes good and the nutrition is preserved, says nutritionist Vijaya Agarwala. If you love crispy fries, get an air frier, she suggests.Cooking stylesNow lets talk about cooking procedures and how they affect nutrition.Boil: People think it is a healthy process even if the end product is bland. However, throwing away the water you boil in means losing 60 per cent of the nutrition of Vitamin B, Vitamin C and minerals. This is also true of rice. So boil things in just enough water and if there is any extra left, use it to make gravy.Also, let the water boil first and then put in the rice, lentils or veggies. Always cook on a low fire, with a lid on the pan. You can also use a pressure cooker to boil food in.Steam: This process of cooking retains the most nutrition. Vegetables such as tomato, carrot and broccoli become more nutritious when you steam them. If you saute the ingredients slightly and then steam them, the dish is tasty as well as healthy.Poach: Poaching helps retain the nutrition of an egg. You can also poach thin slices of fish and some vegetables (such as carrots and capsicum).Grill: You can grill vegetables, fish and meat but be careful not to char them. Any charred or blackened parts should be removed. Eating such parts can lead to cancer in the breast and pancreas as the process brings about harmful chemical changes in meat and chicken. Grill only the lean cut (low on fat) of meat or chicken.Saute: The easiest way is to cook in the saut mode on an induction cooker. You can even do it on low heat on a gas. Use olive oil for the best nutrition (especially anti-oxidants).Microwave: Extensive research has shown that cooking in the microwave retains nutritive value but can make food dry. Sprinkle some water on the food before reheating it to keep it moist. However, never use a plastic or melamine vessel to reheat food in the microwave oven."

Dried eucalyptus branches, which are burnt to crack the stone underneath, litter the hill. The entire hillock has been carved out, leaving just a small fort on top.Every night, 2 to 4 truckloads of stones are taken from the hill... the mining has been happening for decades by some influential people, said a villager.Over the years, quarrying has come to the edge of the fort. Now, blocks are removed from right under the fort. The fort wont last long, said the villager. The origin of the fort is unclear, with some historians believing that the structure could date back to the 17th century, where it was used as a defence post for the army. It is from this post, that they could get a view of the plains stretching till Bengaluru.However, there is no legislation to protect the structure.No recognition givenThe unprotected site is just one of the estimated 30,000 historical structures dotting the States landscape that has not been recognised under either the Central Acts governing the Archaeological Department or State laws for the State Archaeological Department.Experts believe a majority of these structures, like the Uddappanahalli fort, are under threat. Their fears were communicated to Tourism Department officials during a recent meeting on protecting such monuments.There has been no survey of unprotected monuments since 1942. Surveys do not cost much, and there are enough archaeologists and students who can do it.It needs to be done before we lose out on a lot of history. Weve already spoiled megalithic burial (10,000 to 30,000 years old) sites in most places of the states, said N.S. Rangaraju, a former Archaeology professor and a member of the Heritage Expert Committee.A few years ago, he and his students had taken up a pilot of three districts in south Karnataka. Over 550 unprotected structures were identified. These monuments are over 100 years old, and many of these are religious structures under the Muzrai Department, which does not have the expertise for conservation, he said.S.K. Aruni from Indian Council for Historical Research (ICHR) said a majority of these unprotected structures represent hundreds of years of village histories.There needs to be a micro-level documentation of history. But, it needs involvement from the people and the panchayat first. If they can get a preliminary document of the historical structures in the village, then researchers can build upon it, he said.There has been no survey of unprotected monuments since 1942.

5ce5df16e8e3fc56af40fa0a,A tale of two States,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-tale-of-two-states/article25694572.ece,2018-12-08,,The Hindu,"A few farmers sit huddled near a statue of Sardar Patel at Balaguda village in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh pouring out their woes over steaming cups of tea. The statue marks the entry point to the Patidar-dominated village.One of them, Manoj Patidar, who has just returned from the Mandsaur wholesale market, says that the goods and services tax (GST) and rising prices of diesel have made agriculture a loss-making activity. If the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government stays for another five years, we will have to sell our lands, says the tall farmer, his wry smile deepening the lines on his weather-worn face.In another place and State  in Rajasthan  separated by distance as well as priorities, Chhatar Singh Rathore of Tena village in Shergarh tehsil in Jodhpur district has a very different concern.He runs a roadside dhaba on National Highway 114, which connects Jodhpur to Jaisalmer. His main complaint concerns what he believes to be the wilful disregard of Rajput sentiment. Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, who is seeking a second consecutive term in office, he says, has humiliated Rajputs by not backing their opposition to the film Padmaavat , and also marginalising Manvendra Singh, son of former Union Minister Jaswant Singh, who is a Rajput.With not much farming visible in the entire region, caste is the primary marker of social identity, unlike in Madhya Pradesh, where locals display a clear sense of identity as farmers. The contrast between Mandsaur and Shergarh points to the differences between two worlds. While both are rural, one is agrarian and the other is dominated by an array of non-farm activities.On November 30, all eyes were on New Delhi where there was a massive protest by farmers who had gathered from all over the country in the thousands. Opposition leaders such as Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, and CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury spoke. This event came in the wake of another landmark protest held more than a year ago.In the middle of last year, farmers organisations had taken out a rally that touched Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, among other places. The participants also visited Mandsaur, where, a month earlier, five farmers had been killed in police firing. Weighed down by debts, the agitating farmers were demanding loan waivers.As politics heats up in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the Opposition sees farmer anger as having the potential to dent the prospects of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has performed well in most State elections held since it came to power in 2014. The reading is not far off the mark. The BJP scraped through in its stronghold of Gujarat in the 2017 Assembly elections, as a result of urban votes. The Congress, on the other hand, did well in rural Gujarat.However, one was able to get an idea of the situation while travelling through Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan over the last month. In a complex picture, the rural cannot always be conflated with the agrarian.Long list of woesMadhya Pradesh today presents a picture of rural discontent that is cementing an amorphous farmers identity  a sort of occupational consciousness  that the ruling BJP will have to be wary of in the future. But the same does not hold true in Rajasthan, where the rural sector is involved in an array of occupations  from stone mining and animal husbandry to forays into the hospitality sector through highway and city restaurants. There is nothing like a farmers identity across the vast, parched, swathes of Indias largest State by land area.It takes half an hour to reach Pipliya Mandi, the epicentre of last years farm unrest, on the road from Mandsaur to Neemuch town in Madhya Pradesh. Mukesh Patidar, a soyabean farmer in his mid-30s, has come to the mandi (wholesale market) to buy agricultural implements. My village, Chilot Pipliya, which is about 17-18 kilometres from here, saw one farmer become a shaheed (martyr) last year, he says. He adds that soybean farmers are a distressed lot, with a long list of grievances.If the fertilizer DAP (Diammonium Phosphate) cost Rs. 800-900 per 50 kg in 2013-14, it is now priced at Rs. 1,440 for 45 kg, he says. Potash, which was priced at Rs. 450 per 50 kg one-two years ago, now costs Rs. 900 kg, he adds.We use tractors to prepare our fields for the crop. They run on diesel, which has gone up from Rs. 50 a litre to around Rs. 70 a litre, Patidar says. And labour charges have also gone up from Rs. 150-200 to Rs. 300 a day now. Why will they work for less? They are getting grain at Rs. 1-2 a kg.He predicts that the BJP will lose votes in villages around Pipliya Mandi this time. Dilip Patidar, a farm activist who also runs a shop selling various agricultural goods, says the GST has made things difficult for farmers. He says, The GST on pesticide is 28% now. These were taxed at 0-4% earlier. Look at the motor that pumps water to fields. It was taxed at 6% earlier but attracts 12% GST now. The pipe to connect the motor to the fields attracted no tax earlier but attracts 12-18% GST now.All this has made farm inputs dearer. Of the entire area under soyabean cultivation in India, about half is in Madhya Pradesh, the soyabean State of India. The Malwa region, of which Mandsaur is a part, accounts for more than half of M.P.s cultivation of the kharif crop. Fields are prepared by tractor in the summer months. Renting is the norm for small and medium farmers and tractors are rented out for Rs. 700 per hour, up from Rs. 500 because of diesel price hikes. The cost of soyabean seeds, Dilip Patidar says, is Rs. 5,400 per quintal. Labour charges for sowing as well as harvesting have gone up, he adds.Electricity bills too have shot up. While it is possible to run a diesel engine instead of an electric motor to pump water into the fields, with diesel prices going up, it is becoming an expensive proposition now as with diesel becoming more expensive, with costs are Rs. 200 per hour.The soyabean produce is transported to the mandis (wholesale markets) in Pipliya Mandi, Mandsaur and Neemuch. Here again, transportation is more expensive because of the rise in diesel prices. The present minimum support price (MSP) for soyabean is Rs. 3,399 per quintal, but it sells in mandis at Rs. 2,800-3,100 per quintal.In 2013-14, the mandi prices had gone up to Rs. 4,500-5,000 per quintal, says Mukesh Patidar. He blames faulty export-import policies for the fall in prices.Mandi prices keep fluctuating on a demand-and-supply basis, and vary each day. Says a wholesale trader at the Mandsaur Mandi who refuses to be identified, These are like the stock market. It is partly the luck of the farmer and partly his ability to read trends that determine the price he gets for his produce.Look at onions. When prices begin to rise, they import these and the prices fall again, says Dilip Patidar.Indeed, the interests of farmers and consumers are at odds. When the prices of farm produce rise, the commissions of wholesale traders and other intermediaries in the supply chain push up the retail prices of farm produce. When prices fall, food price inflation ceases to be a problem but farmers face losses, rendering agriculture unprofitable as an occupation.For example, at the Ajmer vegetable wholesale market, tomatoes were selling at Rs. 8 a kg. On the previous two days, 1 kg was was selling at Rs. 10 and Rs. 12, respectively. Just 2 km away at the retail market, it was selling at Rs. 20.The dip in farm fortunes is visibly impacting the politics of Madhya Pradesh, a traditional BJP stronghold, with the Congress clawing back in the villages. The troubles of increased documentation, paperwork and bank payments,  seen by many as a part of the formalisation of the sector and cleaning up of the system  have also annoyed farmers.The M.P. government has put in place a subsidy scheme called Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (BBY), under which the government promises to plug the gap between market prices and the minimum support price (MSP). But to avail it, a farmer has to register himself at an authorised office and produce the required documents at the grain and vegetable market when he goes to sell his produce.Says Sunil Solanki, a farmer: Our soyabean crop gets a subsidy of Rs. 500 a quintal. But for this we have to submit a copy of our documents to the mandi merchant, who submits our farmer code numbers to the official market committee and then credits the money to our accounts, a process which takes between 10 and 15 days. The government subsidy under the BBY, he adds, takes two to three months to get credited to a farmers bank account. Unlike farmers elsewhere, farmers in M.P. are not paid in cash as everything is digitised.In other words, say several farmers, they pay in cash for labour, for renting tractors, and to transport the produce, but get paid by bank transfer. The time lag results in a cash crunch. They complain of long queues at markets and banks. Sensing this as an opportunity, Congress leaders have begun to promise cash payments to farmers if voted to power, according to local residents.Economist Utsa Patnaik says that the coming together of farmers across classes  the poor and the rich  was long overdue. She says: There has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. There has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation, and the displaced will be absorbed by industry. The experience of Europe was different. Rather than being absorbed in industry there, the displaced were exported to North America, Australia and South Africa, and they captured the resources there after subduing indigenous people. We dont have that option.She adds: The open trade policies have exposed farmers to the highs and lows of global prices, which they cannot withstand. The meaning of priority sector has also changed under the influence of neoliberal policies, and farmers are unable to access low-interest loans. They have to borrow from private lenders at high interest rates and end up in a debt trap. It is only now that people have begun to notice the farm unrest that was waiting to burst forth.Other sources of incomeFew farmers can be seen at the Ajmer wholesale vegetable market after 11 a.m. They come here at 3 a.m. and leave after selling their produce  in return for cash payments  by 9-10 a.m. The mandi lacks the scale of operations or the frenzied activity of, say, the Surat wholesale market or even Azadpur Mandi in Delhi.The reason is not hard to find. This correspondents journey through Rajasthan, across 2,100 km, covering Jaipur, Tonk, Ajmer, Sawai Madhopur, Nagaur, Pali and Jodhpur districts, showed farm activity present only in the villages close to Tonk.Rasoolpuri village, which has high Gujjar and Meena populations, has farmland where mustard is grown. Here, farmers complain about rising diesel and fertilizer prices and the limited supply of water, which is available only from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. The produce, they say, sells at Rs. 3,200 a quintal, much below the MSP of Rs. 4,200.Farmers at a tea stall just outside the village say they will vote for the Congress as they are fed up of having their concerns brushed aside.But most of rural Rajasthan is a very different world. Villages, even around Jaipur, for miles on end have hardly any farm activity. The better off among villagers have diversified into non-farm activities such as dairy and poultry, while the poor are into animal grazing or work as labourers in construction activities and other sectors.A 40-minute drive on the Jodhpur-Jaisalmer highway leads to the Balesar-Shergarh belt, an arid, sparsely populated area dotted with Rajput-dominated villages. A detour from the highway down a narrow, broken road reveals what substitutes for farming in this region: stone-mining for the construction sector is in full swing on both sides of the road.Meghlasia is a village with Meghwal (Scheduled Caste) and Rajpurohit families. The latter, who describe themselves as gurus of Rajputs, are Brahmins by caste.Stone-mining is a key source of income for the villagers. In addition, they also sow bajra (millet) after the first rains in June-July, but the yield is subject to the vagaries of the monsoon rains.Caste is the markerLike many other Rajputs who have opened restaurants or dhabas because there is not enough water for farming, Chhatar Singh Rathore of the Rajput-dominated Tena village too runs one on the road towards Jodhpur.Says Rathore, Many people in my village run restaurants on the highway. The richer Rajputs also own restaurants in Jodhpur. There are 10 restaurants in the city run by people from my village.He tries to summarise his villages sources of income: Our previous generation saw many people join the Indian Army. You will find many ex-servicemen here. This generation has taken to the restaurant-catering sector in a major way. That apart, many from the village have migrated to Surat to join the cloth industry where they specialise in designing and packing. Some even race horses in Dubai.The Rajput community in the State has gravitated towards the hospitality sector, with heritage hotels and havelis dotting the State. Many are owned by richer Rajput families. They have a traditional feel and visible Rajput markers such as photographs of men in traditional attire holding a sword or rifle. A lot of them try to attract foreign tourists.This non-farm rural world is in sharp contrast to that of M.P., where an occupational identity centred on farming is being forged. In Shergarh tehsil of Jodhpur, caste remains the prominent identity marker, with cultural issues occupying centrestage.Rathore is unhappy with the Rajasthan government for not standing behind Rajputs on the film Padmaavat . He complains that Vasundhara Raje got the entrance to the Raj Mahal Palace in Jaipur sealed to target former royal Diya Kumari, and also humiliated the family of BJP veteran Jaswant Singh.In Tibna village, about 90 km from Jodhpur, water supply poses an acute problem. Sarpanch Bhawani Singh Rathore points to a dry hand pump which is wrapped in a sack cloth. The village has houses placed wide apart, and is populated longitudinally, one house after another for a few kilometres. It has just 300 families, says the sarpanch, of which 150 are Rajput. Other than water, villagers also complain about the lack of school teachers in the local government school. However, despite their various frustrations, they do not think of themselves as aggrieved farmers. Caste remains the key marker of identity and status.You find three types of scenarios, says political analyst and author Sajjan Kumar. The first is Madhya Pradesh, where agriculture is linked to the market, with cash crops such as soyabean and cotton. Here, farming is under stress because of a fall in market prices and the impact of demonetisation. The second is seen in agrarian States such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (excluding western U.P.). Their agriculture is not linked to the market, with mainly food crops such as rice and wheat being produced. An arid State such as Rajasthan presents a third scenario, where agriculture is not central to rural life.He explains the significance of these diverse realities: An occupational identity, where people identify as farmers, is emerging in States of the first kind, such as M.P., Maharashtra and Gujarat. In States such as U.P. and Bihar, while agriculture is central to rural life, caste and religion remain dominant identity markers in the absence of strong market linkages of agriculture. In Rajasthan, in the near absence of agriculture as a key rural vocation, identity markers are still tied to caste.Rathores sentiments lend credence to this hypothesis. I have no problem with [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi. He says we should sell pakodas if we can and I have been doing so at my restaurant, he says. My problem is with Vasundhara Raje. Rajputs will try to ensure a victory for Manvendra Singh at Jhalrapatan. What is a Rajput without self-respect?There has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. There has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation.Utsa Patnaik,Economist"

Herds of elephants have started coming from the Bannarghatta National Park along the Cauvery North Wild Life Sanctuary. The onward movement of the herds will be seen in Hosur forest range along Thally, Jawalagiri, Noganur, Panai, Denkanikottai, Udedurgam and Sanamavu.In its wake, agricultural fields with paddy, corn, tomatoes, ragi, beans, carrots, and sugarcane on the fringes of the reserve forest will face the onslaught of the elephants.However, farmers are told not to venture out in the night to guard their fields. The government provides compensation for crop loss, and hence farmers are cautioned against risking their lives.The department has also warned the public from indulging in chasing the elephants on their own, creating havoc in the midst of the herd and dispersing the herd. Villages along the migratory route of the elephants have also been advised to alert the Forest Department on any sighting of elephants. They can contact forest ranger, Hosur at 98420 85519; forest ranger, Shoolagiri at 94861 82382; forest ranger, Krishnagiri, at 97860 87579, forest ranger, Denkanikottai, at 88259 46041, forest ranger, Jawalagiri, at 84894 82214, and forest ranger, Anchetty, at 94892 87104."

Though August and September witnessed a couple of spells of rain, the officials termed it as untimely.Telling effectWith decrease in the water table, the rabi season has its drawbacks, with the farmers unwilling to take up crops. As against the expectations of officials and farmers as well, the paddy yield turned dismal in about 30,000 hectares and the groundnut crop could survive in just 1,600 hectares, while it is set to perish in about 18,000 hectares.Agriculture Officer (Chittoor) G. Sujatha said that 2018 witnessed 42% deficit rainfall. She said this phenomenon had a telling effect on the overall agriculture scenario in the district.Though the district administration had cherished ambitious plans for the horticulture sector this year, the scenario had presented dismayed results with mango growers receiving a jolt due to delayed flowering and crop cutting. The district administration had to come to their rescue by arranging support price in coordination with the pulp industry.The deficit rainfall in Kuppam region has brought disappointment to the horticulture sector, adversely impacting the rose and grape gardens.The farmers said that unlike the previous years, this year saw prolonged dry spell till the second week of October, taking away the moisture in air.The sugarcane cultivation in the western mandals also took a beating. Though some farmers were persuaded to undertake natural farming to overcome the drought conditions, it was much delayed, and they could only think of the switch next season.The saving grace is that tomato growers in Madanapalle region escaped the wrath of drought by undertaking the cultivation in multiple phases. Much to their happiness, the groundwater table was not alarming till recently."

Read MoreDownload The Times of India News App for Latest CityAHMEDABAD: Our Sabarmati waters are laden with neurotoxic metals, even though municipal sewage and industrial effluent treatment plants claim to have treated the sewage. Its a serious threat to hundreds of farmers in 43 villages downstream of the Sabarmati who use waste waters for growing vegetables and crops.A recent study carried out by the Collaborative Regional Research Programme (CRRP) of the Asia Pacific Network (APN) and the discipline of earth sciences at IIT-Gandhinagar found that copper levels were 7 to 9 times higher than limits set by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). Nickel was found to be 2 to 5 times higher; iron, 4 to 5 times higher; selenium, 4 to 10 times higher; and chromium , 8 to 9 times higher.After the Gujarat government launched its Policy for Reuse of Treated Waste Water in May this year, many STPs across the state are being installed to provide farmers with treated waste water to grow food to meet water demands in stressed areas. A senior Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) official admitted that many of the STPs in the state are not capable of filtering out heavy metals. The ecology research laboratory of the department of botany of the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) had found that heavy metals from treated waste water used for agriculture found they way into vegetables  amaranthus, cabbage, spinach, okra, egg-plant and tomato. The research was carried out by R K Sharma and M Agarwal from BHU and F Marshall from SPRU Freeman Center, Sussex University, the UK.One of the origins of the heavy metal load in urban environment is waste water effluents, said IIT-Gn Professor Manish Kumar who is the lead principal investigator (PI) of the project along with IIT-Gn Scholars Bhagwana Ram, Subhash K Sharma, and Arbind Patel. Kumar went on to say: The extent of its accumulation depends usually on industries in the vicinity and the lack of awareness on unscientific dumping of wastes. One also requires a precise understanding of heavy metal absorption in soil, road dust, and sediment.Kumar said that unlike organic contaminants, heavy metals are non-biodegradable and tend to accumulate in living organisms. There are heavy metal ions that are known to be toxic or carcinogenic, Kumar said. Industrial effluents from tanneries, electroplating , dyeing, metallurgical and paint businesses, and other metal preparing and refining operations contain significant measures of metal particles."

Farmers also agreed that innovation is the key to the next level of reforms in production and income. The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Ropar, has put up on display many products, one of which was 'Smart integrated irrigation and energy management system'.Talking about this innovative system, Dr Vikrant Bhakar, from IIT Ropar, said, ""This product helps convert extra power from solar to AC through an inverter and the farmer can save up to 7,560 units of power per year, and earn a good amount of money, if he decides to sell this power.""The Institute has also displayed products for keeping fruits and vegetables fresh for two to three days; for peeling off peas; and Agri Marketing-App.""We are the technology partner for a project on 'Sustainable Food Supply Chain Systems and Water Management', being undertaken in collaboration with the University of Cambridge,"" Bhakar added. 'Innovation is Great' - so goes the tagline of the pavilion of the United Kingdom (UK).There are multiple companies which have brought along their innovative products in the streams of pre and post-harvest management. Nextek has developed a hydrogen-based film to increase the shelf-life of the agri-produce.Speaking of the product, Professor Edward Kosior, Managing Director, Nextek said, ""Our packaging has the capacity to reduce water loss and stop condensation, hence the life of the agri-products increases. We are undertaking this project in collaboration with India and ten companies from both the countries are engaged in research, development and testing.""Ardra Systems has displayed their soil sensors, which release water when required, saving the wastage of water. PBD Biotech has developed a revolutionary kit to identify bacteria in a cow's milk, which will work for disease prevention.Also, countries like Canada, China, Israel and Netherlands also have displayed many innovative products in grain storage management, biosystems, genetics, disease control.Khristein Water, co-founder of Sponnado, a Canada based company which has developed an air sampler says, ""these products cost Rs 16,000 and will give the farmer advance warning from one to two weeks that there is fungal infection in his crop be it potato, tomato and other crops and thus the farmer will be able to take remedial measures and spray accordingly. It will cover an area of 50 to 100 acres thus a group of farmers or village can buy this system. There is small device in this sampler which will collect the sample and that has to be send to the laboratory for testing and thus from the test one will be clear which kind of fungal infection,'' she says.Tech giant Microsoft also endeavors to make companies and farmers aware of their B2B solution which is a cloud-enabled 'Special Purpose Agri-specific Platform'.A representative of Microsoft shared that the app-based system will help the pharmaceutical companies, farm equipment companies, seed companies to gather information about the ground and weather conditions to send an advisory to the farmers about when to spray pesticides when to sow the seeds.""Research and testing is on for this product, and it will be made available globally by next year,"" he said.Pramod Rajan, Head - Research and Development, International Tractors Limited (Sonalika Group) said, ""For real ground-level adoption of technology, there needs to be a two-way communication between the business and the end-user.

Many of the women workers are now taking up odd jobs and working as domestic helps. This will give them a better option, KSCDC chairman S.Jayamohan told The Hindu .Suphalam projectThe corporation will launch its own agricultural task force as an extension of Suphalam, its organic vegetable farming project inaugurated in September. The agriculture sector was severely hit by the floods leading to a steep fall in domestic vegetable production. Suphalam is one of the many projects introduced by the government to overcome the crisis, he said.At KSCDCs first vegetable farm in the State at Kottiyam, many crops are ready for harvest and some are available to the public at their outlet. We have spinach, eggplant, tomato, okra, green chilly, and beans at the factory along with banana and tapioca. The demand for organic vegetables is too high and we are developing a regular clientle as well. 300 workers were involved in farming in shifts and they were paid Rs. 3 lakh as remuneration. It guarantees more working days for the labourers, an income for the corporation and safe vegetables for the public. By December, all other factories will be part of Suphalam and the training too will start, he said.ObjectiveImplemented with the support of Kerala State Agency for the expansion of Cashew Cultivation, Horticorp, Agriculture Department and Haritha Mission, Suphalam aims to produce 100 tonnes of vegetables by March 2019 from the farms at various factories in the State.The corporation will also distribute MGNREGA job cards to all cashew workers so that their income is not blocked during the gaps when factories remain closed. Many of them are not card holders, so we will issue cards to them from December 6.Alternative vocationHe added the green task force was also part of attempts to find them alternative vocations, the only way of survival for the labourers in the crisis-stricken traditional sectors.We are slowly introducing them to other concepts so that their lives are not affected in the long run, he said."

He is hopeful of heading there next summer and immersing himself in the citys sustainable and inventive approach to food.The head chef at Mumbais Olive Bar & Kitchen is on a mission to change the way people consume food and if his new menu is anything to go by, its a change we welcome with open arms and loosened belts.Backyard goodiesIn November, the iconic Mediterranean fine-dine in Bandra, Olive, celebrated its 18th anniversary. On offer are a new cocktail, and food menu. Not many may know that the restaurant has its own back garden; it flooded in the monsoon but is now blooming. It is here that bar manager John Leese seeks herbs and inspiration for a cocktail menu that aims to highlight agave spirits. The Garden of Eden (Rs. 630) has gin shaken with a lychee puree, with lemongrass and ginger adding fragrance and heat. The drink starts out bitter and then mellows down to a smooth sweetness; with basil oil adding depth. Tommys Margherita (Rs. 750) has agave nectar and El Jimador Blanco tequila and a sharp drink with citrus notes.In-house creationsThe drinks are respectable but its Olives food that makes the strongest impression. Sachdeva believes in treating ingredients and produce with respect and showcasing them to the fullest. Theres emphasis on organic and locally sourced fare (from across India), and reduced wastage. Everything that cannot be sourced locally is made in-house, including bread, butter, sauces, spreads, ferments, pickles and sausages. Earlier we did a lot of fruit and vegetables ferments. Now, we are pushing the boundaries using grain and wheat and fish, says Sachdeva. Its easier and simpler this way; we dont want to rely on cans. It makes for food that is inventive and indulgent.Take the Tuna Jerky (Rs. 525), richer and more nuanced than any meat jerky. Sachdeva takes fresh, local tuna and smokes it slowly till it dries up and intensifies in flavour. The jerkys saltiness is softened by crushed potatoes and smoked ketchup. A Red Velvet Fried Chicken 2.0 (Rs. 525) dunks chicken in a batter of cake crumbs and buttermilk and fries it till golden and moist and dusts it with red velvet crumbs. Its finger lickin good. The no-waste Sweet Corn Gnocchi (Rs. 375) is a Sachdeva favourite. It uses every part of the corn: cob and kernels become a puree, kernels turn into gnocchi, husk is fermented and added to puree, and some of the husk is used to smoke the accompanying cabbage hearts. All the trimmings from the corn and other vegetables go into a vegetarian XO sauce, smoky on the tongue and caramel in colour.Comfort foodThose with a dairy turn of mind will be delighted with the cheese on offer, sourced from different farms across India and some made in-house. Homemade stringy cheese is stuffed in rice balls, drizzled with truffle oil and served as a Mushroom and Truffle Arancini (Rs. 375). Its crisp, gooey and earthy. The Baked Brie & Truffle (Rs. 450) is stunning  truffle brie is paired with mascarpone and heaps of parmesan shavings, served on house-made raisin bread. Its a mouthful of umami, warm and creamy brie playing with the slight sweetness of the crunchy bread. Its a dish that shows off technique, has locally sourced ingredients and it serves as delicate comfort food. Theres homemade ricotta, crumbly and heavy pairs with smoky roasted sweet potatoes (Rs. 395); stringy burrata with fresh, sweet tomatoes (Burrata and Heirloom Tomatoes, Rs. 395) and chilled goats cheese with fresh figs and quinoa (Figs and Goat Cheese, Rs. 395).To round-off the meal is the Vodka Milk Panna Cotta (Rs. 450). Vodka added to milk helps the resultant ice cream set on its own. This intense combination is offset by a plain vanilla panna cotta, a berry puree for some sourness, and apple granite (with cucumber juice); theres white chocolate too, but it makes the whole dish too heavy.The menu will see a few additions over the next few months. Sachdevas homemade duck sausage, which sold out in a week is curing; and a new batch is expected in December. A spoiled can of expensive anchovies eventually led him to can his own fish so now mackerel bones and heads are being cured to make an intense oil. Expect many such experiments in the future, asserts Sachdeva.Olive, Khar (W); phone: 43408229, open from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. (Monday to Sunday) and 12.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. (Saturday and Sunday)"

Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav led one such group from Bijwasan. Narmada Bachao Andolan activist Medha Patkar, All India Kisan Sabhas Hannan Mollah and others joined the protest that was held under the united banner of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee The march Thursday led to traffic snarls on 26km of city roads. We are saying sorry to people who have been troubled due to traffic snarls. We have distributed pamphlets among them to briefly explain the farmers distress, Yadav said.The pamphlets urged the people to join them when they march to the Parliament on Friday. Farmer groups also threatened to protest naked if stopped from reaching there.The pamphlets stated that farmers get only Rs 5 per kilo of tomato while consumers pay Rs 30. Our life is also cheap. In the last 20 years, over three lakh farmers have committed suicide, the pamphlet informed.The farmers said they demand the convening of the Parliament to pass two bills: one pertaining to one-time full loan waiver, the other for a long-term institutional measure to ensure farmers are not pushed into debt again. They also demand implementation of Swaminathan Commission recommendations that say the minimum support price should be fixed at 50% above the comprehensive cost of production.Yadav called the BJP government at the Centre the most anti-farmer government ever. The protest march is for the liberation of farmers from the spectre of suicides, from various forms of exploitation propagated by the state and from organised loot and plunder, he said.Anish Kumar from Delhi School of Social Work said there is a lack of political will to address the agrarian distress. We joined the protest to give strength to the voice of the farmers that has been raised at a crucial time ahead of next General Election. We want the policy-makers to listen to the voice, Kumar said.A group of students from Delhi University joined the protest march near Dhaula Kuan. The farmers claimed that in all marches students, artists, lawyers, doctors, etc, extended support.A musical evening mainly based on agrarian, rural and folk themes was organised at Ramlila Maidan where the farmers retired for the night.In Video: Delhi: Farmers gather in capital today to protest against centre"

Tell me chetta Folk singer Kovan and team sang with vigour in Tamil, as the black and yellow logo of Aarppo Aarthavam shone in the background. As the venue, the Vanchi Square in Kochi, swayed like Punnamada Lake to their tunes, the activists who launched the campaign welcomed each of the enthusiasts who trickled in to watch whats going on. Yes, we are trying to bust the discriminations and myths based on menstruation in our State, chechi. You may sit inside if you like, said one of the organisers to a curious inquiry from a middle-aged woman, and she blushed like a tomato.While the onlookers like her witnessed the proceedings with a question mark looming on their faces, the voices from inside the little tent at the venue were firm. Lawyer Maya Krishnan, one of the organisers of the event, said, India is a country that signed an international covenant, agreeing that it will campaign against the biases based on menstruation. But we saw how the people responded to the topic of womens entry to Sabarimala Temple, saying the people of the gender arent supposed to be in its premises as women menstruate. Its scary how even in our families, there is a discrimination against it and today, we launch a campaign aiming to wipe these out for good.The programme saw the participation of many progressive thinkers, ranging from social critics like Sreechithran, transgender people, women who had announced their plans to visit Sabarimala and more. While they were the invited guests, the audience included those like C P Srihari, a techie who came all the way to Kochi from Thiruvananthapuram to take part in the event. When such a movement happens, the least you can do is proclaim your support by giving it word of mouth publicity. I am someone who often speaks for equality of women in all forums possible and taking part in such a programme would help me speak for it better, even if it is at a gathering of friends, Srihari says.Social critic Sreechithran M J, who also took part in the event, said its time we spoke out loud for those like the little girl who recently lost her life in Tamil Nadu while being forced to stay outside her house during cyclone Gaja because she was menstruating for the first time. Yes, there might be many people, including women, who speak in favour of the discrimination on our streets these days, but we are standing up for those many women who lost their lives, face unjust treatment and lead miserable lives for this natural, biological process, he says, alongside his mom and activist Jayashree.The organisers say that the programme at the Vanchi square is a launch pad for a detailed campaign to create awareness about menstruation. From school to school, college to college and family to family, we have charted out an initiative to do whats needed to cleanse this bias. Enough is enough, says Maya.In Video: Aarppo Aarthavam: Not letting discrimination thrive. Period."

Rajagopal was elated when his daughter R. Jayavarshini told him she was keen on pursuing farming  an avocation that ran in the family  despite having completed an engineering course. The father-daughter duo underwent training at a poly greenhouse plantation in Hosur and began cultivating crops at Rajappan Chavadi near Needamangalam.But their hopes came crashing down as Cyclone Gaja struck. She did not want to take up any other job, and I started the plantation in her name. The yield was very good and encouraging. But Cyclone Gaja turned everything upside down as our greenhouse plantations were completely destroyed, said Mr. Rajagopal, whose plantation was, notably, inaugurated by the District Collector.He had set up three units, covering 25 cents each. Each unit had cost over Rs. 9 lakh for the greenhouse and an additional Rs. 2 lakh for the installation of a drip irrigation system. The government subsidy is limited to one acre, which means the unit would get only Rs. 4.5 lakh as against the Rs. 9 lakh spent on building it.I had a structure capable of withstanding wind speeds of up to 120 km per hour. The destruction [caused by Gaja] shows that the wind speed [during the cyclone] was much higher, said S. Jeethaman Krishna, who took up agriculture after completing an MBA from the University of Wales.We are a family of agriculturists, and I opted for horticulture in Tiruvarur  the rice bowl. I established the plantation in 2013, said Mr. Krishna, who cultivated cucumber, tomato and coriander as an intercrop. He said a unit could produce 20 tonnes of vegetables and bring revenue of Rs. 15 lakh per annum.When asked whether he would be able to use his plantation again, Mr. Krishna said he would have to start from scratch, as the wind had shaken the foundation of the structure. The absence of an insurance scheme was a major problem, he added."

The 31-year-old guy from Delhi recently added another feather on his cap (read: chefs hat) when he appeared as a guest judge on one of the episodes of MasterChef Australia, on the popular shows 10th anniversary special season, in which the contestants had to recreate his famous butter chicken for an elimination round.In a telephonic chat with us, Saransh spoke about his MasterChef experience, future plans and a possible Goila Butter Chicken restaurant in Calcutta.You are globally known for your Goila Butter Chicken. Whats the secret that makes it different from butter chicken served elsewhere?Its actually a home recipe. I used to cook it for my parents when I was much younger. They used to always complain that as vegetarians, they got to eat a much more shoddy version of butter chicken, which is paneer butter masala. And that would always be too creamy and too sweet. When I went to my culinary school, I figured out a recipe where I would smoke it with coal and serve it to them. So basically, it would be more robust and smoky. Thats how I ended up infusing smoke into a traditional butter chicken gravy.I also reduced the amount of fat and dairy that goes into the dish  basically cream and butter  so the tartness of tomato shines out. Since we infuse smoke using coal  a more traditional technique  it makes the dish a little different. So Goila Butter Chicken is lighter, home-style and guilt-free; something that a millennial would eat. The dish is more in sync with today. Its not modern in its presentation but in its flavour profile.What is your earliest memory of having butter chicken?I am not someone who grew up eating butter chicken. The first butter chicken I ate was in my college, IHM, Aurangabad. My trainer was an ex-ITC chef and he had a very good recipe for the dish. That was my first taste of butter chicken  creamy, very refined, smooth with lots of flavours. Then when I went back to Delhi and tried the local butter chicken that people like, it was very different than what my trainer had made me try. What I realised was that people would actually savour the extra creamy, buttery and bright orange version of the recipe.Its interesting that despite being a vegetarian for most part of your life, you are known for a chicken dish. Wasnt it difficult to understand the flavours and innovate on a dish which you had never had until you were in college?When I was first put into the butchery section in college, I went with a professional approach since I didnt have any option. I didnt know how meat tastes, how its cooked. I feel cooking is a balance between passion and technique.Your personal favourite when it comes to butter chicken apart from your own?Its actually from a restaurant in Delhis Ashok Vihar called Invitation. For me, thats the best butter chicken I have ever had.How did your restaurant come about?I always thought I would open a fine-dining restaurant. I never thought I would end up opening a QSR which is centred around butter chicken! It occurred to me only after I started doing TV shows that we, as chefs, look at food as a luxury but when you travel across India you realise that its first a necessity. So this is when it came to my mind to test it out as a venture since I already had a popular recipe. So June 2016 is when I opened Goila Butter Chicken in Bombay.Whats next for Goila Butter Chicken?We are looking at expanding to different parts of the country. Right now its just Bombay but we are looking to expand to cities like Bangalore, Calcutta, Delhi and Gurgaon.You have been a contestant yourself on Food Food Maha Challenge (a reality show on Food Food) which you ended up winning too (2011). How was it like being a guest judge on a show like MasterChef Australia?Life has come full circle for me. When you find fame through a reality show, it becomes much more challenging because theres fame to deal with. Suddenly people start doubting your capability as a restaurant chef because they feel you are more of a TV person. So there has to be a balance. You have to keep honing your skills.I feel satisfied with the fact that I got an opportunity through winning a reality show. I was very, very happy that MasterChef got me on board not only because of my popularity but because of my product. That makes me feel very proud. I was just out of college when I had started watching MasterChef and I always used to dream of being on the show. And to be there as a guest judge, getting so much respect, makes you feel great.The set is beautiful, its a permanent structure that has been stationed there for 10 years. They are very professional and honest in their approach towards the show. No wonder MasterChef Australia is the most popular MasterChef franchise across the globe. Theres a soul to the show.Saransh Goila (centre) with (from left) Gary Mehigan, Matt Preston and George Calombaris on the sets of MasterChef Australia. Source: TwitterTell us some of the fun things that happened behind the scenes on the set...When I met Matt (Preston) on the set, he was talking about his trip to India. He is such a great orator that when he was talking about Hyderabadi Biryani, just the way he was describing it made me feel like having it right then and there. He is a fun person and also very particular about his costumes. I had done a pop-up at chef Georges (Calombaris) restaurant, as a part of the Melbourne Food & Wine Festival in the same month when we were filming MasterChef. He loves to party, engage with young people and promote them. I owe this opportunity to him.George is full of life, energetic. Matt is probably a romantic and an intellectual and Gary is down to earth, likeable and honest. He loves India, be it the food, spices, people he spends three months a year in India now. As an Indian, you would relate to him the most, he is very warm.Your name is in the Limca Book of Records for the longest road journey by a chef. What is your takeaway from it?If I had to break down India into different cuisines, there are so many communities, the cuisine is so diverse every 200km the flavour, food, spice blend, ingredients change. I was very fascinated with the North-east in fact  lots of fermentation, different cooking techniques. Nagaland was an amazing state to be in and experience the tribal cuisine; even Assam was interesting.In the south, I found Andhra cuisine to be quite interesting their pickles are amazing. I discovered gondhoraj lebu in Calcutta. I discovered many such ingredients and realised it would probably take a lifetime if I had to discover everything in our country.Any particular region that stood out?It would definitely be Nagaland. In fact, I did a special at my restaurant  Black Sesame Pork, which was there for three months.Globally, do you think the stereotypes about Indian food has somewhat started breaking or do they still exist?The stereotypes are definitely breaking. There are many international restaurants who are presenting India in a very different format. Be it Gaggan (Anand) in Bangkok or chef Garima (Arora) who became the first Indian woman to get a Michelin star. People have started to realise that Indian food isnt just about curry-driven gravy, its much more than that. Its balanced, theres so much history, influence of Ayurveda this is the time for Indian food to reposition itself.A TV show host, writer and a chef, which role do you like playing the most?The profile that works for me the most is that of a chef traveller. I like to travel within India and share with the world what our country has to offer. Thats something that gives me the most satisfaction.What will we see you doing next?Sadak Chef is something I am working on at the moment. The show (for a digital platform) promotes street chefs who have created amazing dishes but have never got their due. I will be travelling across the country. I am working on a couple of other shows as well; an international one too which we are doing with a big channel in Singapore. I am looking to be more global, trying and selling Indian food across the globe. Thats where I am headed with all my content and activities that I am doing in 2019.QUICK SIXChefs you look up to: I closely follow David Chang. Then theres Jamie Oliver; Anthony Bourdain was someone I used to take inspiration from. Back home theres Sanjeev Kapoor; I used to dedicatedly watch his shows. Now he is a friend and mentor. He will always be someone I look up to.An ingredient you are loving right now: Jackfruit, green garlic. But over all, its mushrooms.A dominant food trend right now: Looking within, going regional when it comes to Indian food. Just getting back the classics and presenting them in a more acceptable format. Theres so much sustainable farming happening, people are now talking about what is available in our country.Your fave cuisine: Indian. Difficult to choose which part of India though.Your earliest memory of cooking: When I made aloo paratha as a kid with the help of my uncle.Your biggest culinary influence: My grandfather. Though, while growing up, I learnt cooking from my mother, I was inspired by my grandfather because I was fascinated with him in the kitchen every Sunday cooking something for us."

I was reminded, well, not of the story, but of the title when we sat down to dinner at Rustoms  a restaurant that serves delicious Parsi food in the Capital  a few nights ago. You could have named our table Seven Hungry Men and Women.I was just making a list of all that we ate, and felt rather embarrassed. We ordered enough for a party of 15. And we finished up almost everything on the table. But let me start at the beginning. A dear friend from Kolkata was in town  ostensibly to see how I was doing. We were meeting her after a long time, so there was much to talk about. So we  a group of seven  gathered at Rustoms.Gourmets delightRustoms has been around for a while in Delhi. I used to hear good things about it when it was at Adhchini. Somehow, I never went there, quite possibly because the traffic there could be manic. But I had been raring to visit the place ever since I heard that Rustoms had moved to the Parsi Anjuman complex on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg.So we gathered there, and ordered chhanch and homemade raspberry soda (Rs. 150 each), sev puri and dahi batata puri (both Rs. 175), Russian pattice (Rs. 295), paatra ni macchhi (Rs. 325), prawn kababs (Rs. 325), salli boti gosht (Rs. 395), chicken dansak (Rs. 175), vegetable Parsi pulao (Rs. 395), caramel custard and lagan nu custard (both Rs. 250) and Bombay kulfi (Rs. 150).I just had a taste of all the fried dishes  and they were delicious. The papri with sev came with a heap of crunchy sev over the papri which had been topped with chopped onion and tomatoes and chutney. The dahi batata puris had potatoes, onions, chutney and a delightfully spiced curd over it. The prawn kababs were again a great mix of mashed prawn and spring onion. But what I really loved was the Rusian pattice  which was a mix of creamy cheese, chicken and mashed potatoes, coated with semolina and some cheese straws and then deep fried. It was  in one word  yum!I had the fish without any guilt pangs. It was a telapiya fillet which had been steamed wrapped in banana leaf after being smeared with sweet, sour and spicy chutney prepared with mint and coriander leaves. I had it with the vegetable pulao and loved it. I am told the prawn berry pulao is a must-have there, but we had friends with a prawn allergy, so steered clear of it.The salli boti gosht  mutton with a spicy tomato gravy topped with crispy potato straws  was nice and rich. I thought the chicken dhansak was just about ok. It seemed like a normal dhansak with minced chicken balls on the side.But I loved the desserts. I thoroughly enjoyed the creamy caramel custard and lagan nu custard  baked with nuts and raisins (I could taste the chironjee). The Bombay kulfi got over before I could even look at it. The mawa cake came gratis but was avoidable, I think.Way to goSo book a table and head for Rustoms at the Parsi Anjuman or Dharamshala. This is the sprawling Parsi complex (ample parking space there) next to the Maulana Azad Medical College, on the other side of the road from all the newspaper offices (Phone: 09910060502 and 01133106353).We left after the dessert but the other five lingered over coffee. And after eating and drinking all that, they eyed the food on other peoples tables and decided that the next time they are there, they will have a thaali. The vegetable thaali (Rs. 400) has soya pattice, Parsi dal, tarkari ni curry, vengna nu achar, steamed rice, Parsi rotis and chutney. The mutton thaali is for Rs. 495 and the pomfret one for Rs. 695. We will wait for the friend from Kolkata to come for another visit, and the Seven Hungry Men and Women shall return."

Farmers markets emerged on the scene almost a decade ago with Kavita Mukhis weekly market in Bandra that attracts a posse of dedicated shoppers. Since then, markets have sprung up in several neighbourhoods from Nariman Point, Shivaji Park, and Juhu to Powai, Thane and Vashi. In September, Caf Zoe launched a one-of-its-kind farmers market right inside their sprawling, light-filled space.The restaurant partnered with Taru Naturals, which works with small-scale farmers across India to provide resources and clean tech to enable organic farming. We met Tarus founder/CEO Ruchi Jain, who holds a Masters in Environment Change & Management from Oxford University, and is a passionate advocate of natural, organic farming.To marketWhat we need is to have thousands of farmers markets. People need to see that organic can be affordable, said Jain. Affordability has long been a pain point for the organic movement but the fresh fruits and vegetables at Caf Zoes farmers market are surprisingly well priced and of high quality. We stocked up on tomatoes and cucumbers, both sweet and flavourful, while the pomegranates are the deepest red we have seen and positively bursting with juice. All vegetables and fruits sold at the market come from Anil Rayates farm in Niphad in Nashik district. While farmers around him concentrate on grapes (Nashiks main cash crop), Rayate instead decided to go the organic route in 2009 with a mixed farm where he grows everything from leafy greens to onions, garlic, and other vegetables. He proudly showed us his certification from Participatory Guarantee System for India (PGS-India) a government body that certifies organic farming practices across India.I use traditional farming techniques like natural mulching, using jivamrut fertiliser (a fermented mixture of dung and urine of Indian Gir cows, jaggery, soil, and water), and natural fungicide made of fermented sugarcane juice, cow dung, yoghurt etc., explained Rayate.What made Caf Zoe venture into this area? We are now six-and-a-half years old and it has always been our plan to support communities, not just be a restaurant. Luckily we have been blessed with a large space that enables us to do these things, said Tarini Mohindar, co-founder of Caf Zoe. Mohindar had been toying with the idea of a farmers market for a while and had even spoken to a few organisers. But I didnt want to do something that was massive, just create a space where you can go and stock up on your veggies for the week, and you dont pay through your nose for it. You have a certificate that tells you its organic and theres no middleman involved, she explained. Mohindar met Jain at a pottery workshop organised at Caf Zoe (conducted by Jains sister), and was impressed with the work that Taru Organics did at the grassroots level. The restaurant has held two farmers markets since mid-September and the response has been encouraging. The Sunday brunch crowd has been leaving with bags filled with fresh produce as well as organic staples such as millets, dals, indie rice varieties like Indrayani, khapli wheat (emmer, an ancient wheat variety) atta, jaggery, turmeric, and more. Apart from partnering for the market, Caf Zoe sources produce from Taru Naturals, which also supplies to a handful of Mumbai restaurants like Kala Ghoda Caf, The Pantry, The Bombay Canteen, Olive, SodaBottleOpenerWala etc.Growing trendAs restaurants increasingly make an effort to source organic, a growing tribe of entrepreneurs is stepping in to fulfil the demand. One such is Zama Organics founded by Shriya Naheta. She graduated three years ago and returned to Mumbai from Los Angeles only to find that high-quality, organic produce was hard to come by at reasonable prices. What really inspired me to start Zama were the travels I went on after I was back. I went on a few trips to Uttarakhand and happened to visit farms in Pune and Nashik as well said Naheta. She started working directly with farmers to source organic produce locally, and currently works with three collectives  one small-time farmer in Pune and a group of farmers each in Nashik and Uttarakhand. One of my main sources is in Uttarakhand in a remote and inaccessible location above Nainital; they are so particular about crop rotation, and the time they sow the seeds or harvest the produce. They have really great irrigation from spring waters from the Himalayas, amazing air quality, and they have always grown organically. Everything they need for farming is grown in the farm itself; whatever vegetables get spoiled are inevitably converted into compost to be used back in the farming process, explained Naheta. Zama Organics supplies to restaurants like Masque, Suzette, Sequel, Rolling Pin, Quattro etc.Naheta also launched value-added products like honeys, jams, chutneys, and pickles, which were recently showcased at a four-course dinner at Masque. We want to really educate people on the concept of sustainability and gradually but surely create a shift, where people look at the benefits of eating sustainably grown and wholesome food, she said.Jain agrees; Restaurants are the harbingers of food innovation in India. So if restaurants like Caf Zoe make a statement with such markets that support small-scale organic farmers, we can get the message across, she said. Rayate had the last word; Now, everyone knows the ill effects of chemicals used in farming. Natural farming is the only solution if we have to sustain this for our future generations he said.Fresh produce and staples from Taru Naturals (tarunaturals.com) and Zama Organics (zamaorganics.com) can be ordered online with delivery available across Mumbai. The next Farmers Market at Caf Zoe will be held on Sunday, November 25 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m."

And on their way back from Ghosh Mansion, Aaduri gives Hem the lowdown on Lata and Ronny.Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, arguably the greatest exponent of relationships in literary Bengal, had written in Devdas that childhood love was, for all its intensity, ultimately cursed. It seldom led to happily ever-afters.But we are both over 18, Kakimoni, Lata had replied, softly, suddenly maudlin even though she found the possibility that what they had  that perfect, fragrant, sunset-coloured thing  might be poisoned to be highly remote. Shed buried her nose in the pink pashmina shawl she had stolen that season from Manjulikas almirah.When shed lifted her head, she saw Kakimoni smiling. Whaaat? shed said, and Kakimoni shucked her chin. That pink is perfect for people newly in love, shed laughed. You are right, it doesnt apply to those who are not children. But Kakimoni said that tartly, raising her eyes in the direction of the verandah where Ronny was bickering with Molly over the carrom board, much like a minor. Well find out, wont we? she said, Whether you were children or adults!Kakimoni would then heave herself from the bed and go out to their little kitchen, carved out of a nook where a tertiary stairway had been boarded up  the Ghoshes had all divided up their kitchens by then  in order to make them scrambled egg sandwiches with cheese. And Lata would drag herself out of bed and curl up in one of the Bombay fornicators kept outside on the verandah (neither she nor Ronny knew the term then), five of them in a line, and impatiently wait for Ronny to stop playing carrom and revise economics with her. Its he who needs the revision more, she would huff. But the sight of him and Molly wrapt in play also made for a pleasant picture. Once, unknown to Ronny, she had snuck his camera out of his bag and taken pictures of them.Where are those pictures? she wonders. Hadnt Ronny framed one and given it to her?When theyd broken up, shed told Kakimoni bitterly, on a weekend she was home with dark circles under her eyes, You were right. Childhood love is poisoned.Not me, Kakimoni had replied sadly, enveloping her in a hug, Sarat-babu.***The Bombay fornicators are long gone.Lata stands now where they used to be lined up and watches as the lights over the courtyard come on. It was Ghosh Mansion all this while; now, in the blink of an eye, it is transformed from a decaying house in a decaying neighbourhood into an unfamiliar place, a new continent, one where happiness and success and glory are all a handspan away for the taking.After Latad taken charge of the Molly-AJ wedding, along with the army Nimki had summoned from the massive contacts list on her phone, Ghosh Mansion had suddenly come alive in the last two days. Given the paucity of time, the rooms on the ground floor were all locked up for the evening in lieu of being cleaned (Lata kept a roster of the keys and promised the various owners of said rooms that it was a temporary matter). The corridor and the courtyard leading to the naach ghar were scrubbed clean. Not even a speck of dust should be visible to the Marwaris, Nimki was heard shouting every 10 minutes or so, Mollys mother-in-law has OCD and we better live up to her standards of cleanliness. In any case, Molly doesnt know any housework. If they see dirty corridors here, they will always link the two. FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE. Lata had also decided that since there was no time to get the walls painted, a major red herring was required. She cajoled the electrician to create a canopy of twinkling lights over the courtyard.The effect, Lata now sees, feeling quite pleased with herself, is magical.Molly steps out of Kakimonis bedroom in her engagement outfit and sighs at the lights. She wears a white chanderi full skirt trimmed beautifully in gold, paired with a post-box red choli. Much to her mothers unhappiness, shes refused to wear anything around her neck but the plain gold choker that Manjulika and Lata had given her from Manjulikas own collection and a pair of gold danglers that had been their great-grandmothers.Lata looks critically at Molly, straightens her tikli  the sole item from her parents trousseau  and then, gently kisses her cheek.I dont know what Id have done without you, Molly murmurs into her hair.Im glad I am here. And I hope you and AJ will come to London and stay with me so I can dispense jamai aador and luchis like a grown-up Ghosh.Molly squeezed her hands. Boro Jethis gold bracelet, studded with pearls and rubies, glittered. It had been a pair that, Lata knew, was given to Jethima, the eldest daughter-in-law, by their grandmother, and Jethima had given her one at her wedding, reserving the other for Molly. What about Goopys bride? Manjulika had said to Jethima then. Arre baba, Jethima had replied conspiratorially, Goopys wife will get a lot!I miss Goopy, Molly said.I was just thinking about him! Lata exclaimed, Anyway, now listen, Bobbys just texted me. They are about 15 minutes away. I think you should go now and sit in the throne room. Guests have arrived. Wheres the entourage?Almost as though theyd heard her, Mollys girlfriends, the old ones from school and college and the new ones from Berlin, all trooped out of her room, where theyd been getting ready. Their individual beauty enhanced by the collective glamour, the girls held themselves erect and frowned in concentration, speaking to each other in code. Lata did not miss a single detail of this pageantry: the wisps of hair slipping out of elaborate hairdos, the silken saris curving and catching at unaccustomed feet. They walked up to the balustrade awkwardly and then, finally finding their stride in their saris, followed Molly down the elaborate staircase, where ancestors in gilt frames looked down at them approvingly.Lata took pictures on her phone, waving the girls away, exhorting them to mind the way. A few minutes later, as they crossed the courtyard, carefully carefully, doddering on their high heels, saris and lehngas bunched up so that their calves were briefly visible, the lights fell on their youthful faces and covered them with stardust.From upstairs, in her pink-yellow tussore sari, Lata watched them and marvelled at the fierce brevity of childhood and youth.Now it was here. Alive and flickering in the stack of Mills and Boon novels under her bed, clattering upon the carrom board, surfacing in the large cupboards in the store room which were perfect for stolen kisses and the third-floor terrace which was perfect for horrible fights.And now it was gone.***First came the ashirbad and then the ring ceremony. The Jaiswals and the Ghoshes and the Germans and the assorted others all mingled happily, eating the delicious (if vegetarian) hors doeuvres and drinking gallons of Blue Lagoon.As regards the food, Boro Jethu had firmly put his feet down. At the Oberoi, they could serve whatever mishmash modern cuisine they wanted to, but at home, it would be old-fashioned comfort food. It was a gargantuan tragedy that the affair had to be made vegetarian. Yes, there would be piles of motorshutir kochuri with stuffed aloor dom and chholar dal with coconut bits. Yes, the old thakurs would whip up family secrets that would never ever be revealed to the Jaiswals. And yes, there would be five kinds of savoury fries, excluding mochar chop and five kinds of mishti, excluding doi. No chatter about calories would be entertained. No dahi vada, golgappa or that sort of rubbish would be served. They were the Ghoshes after all. And there was no question of serving any kind of fancy salad with imported leaves, olive oil and vinegar  only the time-honoured slices of cucumber, tomato and onion on a plate, along with mustard and mayonnaise.Lata had escaped the vice grip of relatives, who had far too many questions than she could handle and whose comments about how slim her waist still was and how expensive her sari looked were all lined with a certain malice. She now stood in a corner and exchanged notes about the next day with a surly Bobby. (Who looked smoky-eyed and bewitching in a black chikankari anarkali set with mukaish work on it.)Whos that? Bobby asked, suddenly interested in a man who had walked up to Nimki and had clasped her hands in his. He wore a beautifully tailored suit, in charcoal grey, and suddenly Lata found herself looking away.(To be continued)"

Hariharan has requested the Chief Wildlife Warden (CWW), Tamil Nadu, to take necessary steps to translocate a wild elephant that has been damaging crops and houses in the Thadagam valley near Coimbatore city.The letter was sent to the CWW on Tuesday, a day after 150 farmers from Thadagam valley petitioned the District Collector, seeking the translocation of wild elephants that are entering villages.The letter seeks capture and translocation of one male wild elephant while two male elephants -- Chinna Thambi and Vinayagan, as named by villagers -- were damaging crops in the valley.The letter said that a male wild elephant was causing problems to the farmers and the public in peripheral areas such as Varapalayam, Pannimadai, Periyathadagam, and Chinnathadagam for the last six months. The animal damaged crops such as tomato, maize, banana and coconut cultivated in areas adjoining the forest.Several steps have been taken by the Forest officials to drive the elephant into the deep forest. But, the elephant often returns to these places and causes damages, said the letter.In October and November, five persons were killed in the attack of wild elephants in Coimbatore Forest Division.The deceased included a member of a Rapid Response Team of the Forest Department engaged in frontline works.A senior official from the Forest Department said that it was for the CWW to take a final call on issuing orders to capture and translocate the wild elephant.Capture and translocation should be the last resort if other measures of mitigating the situation fail. The Forest Department is expected to take a decision which balances the Nature and the sentiments and concerns of the farmers, said Ajay Desai, consultant for the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and member of Asian elephants specialist group of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).P. Kandasamy, District Secretary of Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam, said the Forest Department should eliminate the animal if it was unable to translocate it. This request also was submitted to the Collector."

""Unfortunately Dr Jichkar is no more, but I decided to take his research further,"" said Dixit. Since increase of insulin in blood, usually released after meals, triggers obesity, insulin-resistance and type-2 diabetes, Dixit advises restricting all eating during the day to just two meals.""We appointed Dixit as brand ambassador after we found that his diet plan to tackle obesity and diabetes is yielding results,"" said BJP leader Girish Mahajan, who heads the medical education department.Dr Jagannath Dixit, who has been teaching for 26 years and has won several national and state awards, explained that if insulin level rises in blood, it can trigger many health hazards.Once insulin level rises, the body uses glucose for energy; and if insulin level falls, the body uses fatty acids. As baseline insulin secretion cannot be controlled voluntarily, one option is to control the number of times insulin is secreted into the blood after every eating episode. As more or less the same amount of insulin is secreted every time, irrespective of the quantity of food consumed, reducing eating frequency can reduce the insulin level. So, Dixit's advice is to eat twice when one is hungry; in between two meals, one can drink water, diluted, home-made buttermilk, green or black tea (without sugar), coconut water and one tomato.Dixit claims the simple lifestyle modification is effective in losing weight as well as diabetes reversal. ""If one follows the two-meal practice, I am sure there will not only be weight loss, but it will help in controlling diabetes. Reversal of diabetes is also possible,"" said Dixit.After naming Dixit the ambassador to spread awareness about fighting lifestyle diseases that are proving to be a huge burden for India as well as the state, Mahajan told TOI: ""We have launched a campaign to tackle obesity and diabetes. Dr Dixit has done his own research on the diet plan, obesity and diabetes. He has delivered lectures across the state and international platforms, too, and has come to certain conclusions. We felt it will be appropriate if we appoint him our brand ambassador, it will go a long way in promoting the message to fight obesity and diabetes.""Dixit has been a tireless campaigner for weight loss and reversal of diabetes for the last 10 years, spreading his message through 250 WhatsApp group and other social media platforms. He has more than 50,000 followers from 37 countries."

Follow us to track latest news, live updates, news analysis and cutting-edge data analytics. Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.Pune: In an eight-month low, the tomato prices in November have fallen to Rs3 to Rs6 per kilogram in the wholesale market. The prices are also significantly lower than the wholesale rates prevalent during the same time last year  tomatoes were being sold for between Rs12 and Rs35 per kg in November 2017.The retail price for this kitchen staple, however, is still steady at Rs20 per kg.In July this year, the price per kg of tomato in the wholesale market was between Rs5 and Rs 14. And the rates have been going south since then. They are now less than half of what they were in October and November 2017, the data available with the Pune Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) revealed.The tomato production this year was very good, despite drought-like conditions in parts of the state. APMC officials said the prices have dropped because the tomato supply to the wholesale market has increased.Last year, the prices were high during this period. Anticipating similar prices this year, the farmers cultivated more tomatoes in 2018 as well, said Vilas Bhujbal, the president of the Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard Traders and Agents Association. The farmers in one area grew more tomato crops without realising that their counterparts in other places too were planning on growing more tomatoes. This led to a glut in the market and the prices fell, Bhujbal added.The government should have a mechanism in place to avoid similar situations. The government should conduct studies using satellite imageries  to gauge the extent of agricultural land where a particular crop has been sown. Even the farmers can benefit from such knowledge. If too much of one particular crop has been sown in a season by some farmers, others can limit its cultivation by sowing other crops, he said.Sanjay Pawar, a farmer from Nashik, said tomato production has been bountiful in many locations this time. Apart from Nashik in Maharashtra, even places in Rajasthan and Gujarat have reported bountiful tomato crops. If production is high in Rajasthan and Gujarat as well, then there is always a possibility that tomatoes from Maharashtra will not be exported to those states as they too are experiencing a glut. Also, exports of vegetables to Pakistan have either stopped or slowed down, he said.Shriram Gadhave, the president of the Vegetables Growers Association of India, however, said that excess production of tomatoes in the current period is from regions where the water table has still not dipped considerably, despite the drought declared earlier.While tomato wholesale prices have come down, retail prices have stayed put at around Rs20 per kg. Yakub Pathan, owner of the Fresh Vegetable Market in Wakad, said, Wholesale tomato prices have come down to Rs3 to Rs6 per kg, but retailers are maintaining a status quo on the prices. Even if prices in the wholesale market increase to Rs10-Rs12 per kg, we will continue to sell tomatoes at Rs20."

Vinay on Sunday appealed to farmers in the district to cooperate with the officials conducting a survey of the extent of damage due to the Gaja cyclone.The district witnessed heavy rains on Friday due to the cyclone.Many low-lying areas were inundated. The horticulture crops in many places, particularly on Kodaikanal hills, had suffered maximum damage.SubmergedMany standing crops waiting for harvest in about a fortnight in the district too had submerged in rainwater. The initial survey indicated that close to 300 hectares of horticulture crops raised in Palani, Reddiarchatram, Vedasandur and other pockets had been destroyed. Crops, including hill banana, tomatoes, beans, onion and others, were raised by the farmers.The Collector said that the farmers could identify their lands and furnish their names, particulars of extent of damage and provide the front page of the bank pass book and a photocopy of Aadhaar.In case, officials had not visited their lands, the farmers can directly file the details with 0451-1077 toll-free number, or WhatsApp on 75988 66000 or 0451-2460320, he added."

Natarajan, who inaugurated the two-day event, said that this could be a great preparatory measure ahead of total plastic ban from January 1, 2019.The corporation becomes a place where change is most visible. Since the plastic ban will soon come into effect, people need to be educated about the various alternatives available to make the switch easier, he said.A total of 63 stalls have been set up with manufacturers exhibiting their products that include mini biogas plants and eco-friendly sanitary pads.Green India, a firm from Virudhunagar, has created pencils and pens made out of recycled plastic and have attached small seeds of chilli and tomatoes to make it attractive for children. Since a large amount of wood is used to produce pencils, we decided to make the change and attach seed pellets to the back of pencils. We make environment-friendly invitation cards too, said R. Nagarajan, the proprietor.Members of Kuppaikaran, an institution based out of Salem, said that they would soon be tying up with corporation schools to collect dry waste.We have launched a programme called Wealth and Wellness out of Waste where students can collect dry waste from homes and deposit it in boxes. Each standard has the ability to earn at least Rs. 2,500 every week if they contribute enough waste. We in turn sell it to recyclers. The system promotes waste segregation and educates children about reusing biodegradable waste, said N. Tamilmanian, one of the team members.Other stalls are selling packing material made from eco-friendly products like bamboo, arecanut and cassava starch. Corporation Commissioner S. Aneesh Sekhar said that the exhibition would be a means to show the way to bulk waste generators seeking alternatives to plastic goods."

The innovative farmer has now started exploring the online market.Yogesh T.M., 31, from Taluru in Mysuru district, used take up small jobs in Bengaluru and Mysuru, and had not given a serious thought to farming as his family had only 3.15 acres of land.But, fed up with his work in the city, he returned to his village seven years ago to take up farming. He began growing exotic vegetables like red cabbage, yellow cherry tomato, table radish, broccoli and turnip that have high value.He sells his produce to malls in Mysuru, Bengaluru, Goa and Hyderabad besides big vegetable shops. Now, he grows nearly 25 such varieties and has started exploring the online marketplace. We have created two clusters of farmers for growing foreign vegetable varieties organically. The intention is to ensure their availability at the doorsteps of consumers in Bengaluru and Mysuru through online markets, he says.The University of Agricultural Sciences-Bengaluru (UAS-B) on Friday honoured him with district-level best farmer award at Krishi Mela.More yieldAnother farmer to be honoured by the UAS-B on Friday was Siddappa. The 31-year-old hails from Taggaluru of Gundlupet taluk. He grows cotton, jowar, sugarcane and banana.But his innovation lies in maximising profit by taking up related works, including a plant nursery which fetches him about Rs. 15,000 a month. He has also set up a flour mill that works on his diesel-run tiller so that villagers need not depend on power supply for grinding grains."

Two persons including a young woman from Kerala died when a tree reportedly fell on the car she was travelling on the Kodaikanal ghat road on Friday morning and another farmer died in Vedasandur.Number of dwellings were damaged - fully and partially, low lying areas were inundated and there were complaints of flash floods in many areas. Since the TANGEDCO had switched off the electricity as a precaution, charging mobile phones became difficult and thus communication too was not possible during the day. In Dindigul city, rain water entered houses in Kakkan Nagar, Thirumalaisamypuram and other pockets. Trees were uprooted in RM Colony, MVM Nagar, NGO Colony and other stretches.According to Horticulture department officials, around 280 hectares of crops, including corn, plantain, mango, drumsticks, onion, hill banana, beans and tomato in Oddanchatram, Palani and Reddiarchatram were affected. The worst hit farms were in Kodaikanal hills. Collector T. G. Vinay, District Monitoring Officer Mangat Ram Sharma and other officials were closely monitoring the situation. As and when there were distress calls, the officials exclusively earmarked for carrying out rescue operations were rushed to the spot. Awareness to communicate and reach out to first responders saved many lives and cattle, an official told.Dam level upMany dams witnessed steady rise in inflow since forenoon. The Palar-Porundalar dam near Palani reached its full capacity. The Varadamanadhi dam was overflowing and about 6,000 cusecs of water was discharged from the reservoir. The Mavoor dam near Sirumalai had also touched its full capacity.Many pockets in and around Natham benefited from the rainfall. From as early as 3 a.m., Parali, Vathipatti, Ulupakudi, Koilpatti and other villages experienced steady rain. Tanks which were dry turned full within a few hours. The villagers, particularly, the elders expressed happiness as after nearly a decade a tank in Sithayankottai, near Athur was full. Likewise, Nochiodai tank in S Pudukottai near Krishnapuram too was full. A 100-year-old neem tree was uprooted in the rains in the town.Roads along Nilakottai, Chinnalapatti and Kanniwadi were badly damaged. Due to heavy rain and gusty wind, visibility was poor and many motorists took shelter as a precaution.Trains detainedTrains from Madurai bound for destinations like Mumbai suffered detention as the tracks were damaged. According to railway officials, the Nagercoil-Mumbai Express, Tirunelveli-Mayiladuthurai, Guruvayur-Chennai Express and others had to be detained in between Kodai Road and Ambatturai railway stations. Only after the repair works were carried out, the trains could pass the stretch at five kilometre speed.Two casualtiesTwo persons identified as Neelima, 25, wife of Jerinraj and their child Madhav, 2, were returning from Kodaikanal to Thrisur, Kerala. As the vehicle approached Kallaraimedu ghat section, a tree fell on the car, in which the woman died.

She loves to cook and wrote her first recipe book, Miss Masala: Real Indian Cooking for Busy Living, around eight years ago. Mallika Basu  former Bengal chief minister Jyoti Basus granddaughter  has more kitchen wisdom and scrumptious meals to share in her second cookbook, Masala. Sprinkled with memories of Sunday lunches with her politician grandfather and secret recipes from her north Indian maternal grandmother, Mallika has whipped up a delicious hardback of slow feasts, classic curries, sweet treats, quick fixes and more. We caught up with her on an email chat.What inspired you to write a cookbook, as there are several on Indian cuisine already?This is a very personal book that was inspired by my own experience of trying to fit Indian cooking into a busy family, social and professional life.I use a lot of cookbooks and found myself finding ways to simplify the recipes in them and the recipe instructions being given to me by my family. A lot of Indian recipes are based on nostalgia and age-old traditions, but we dont live the way our parents and grandparents did. Even my mother (theatre veteran Dolly Basu) and her friends use great little shortcuts to make food simpler to cook and more wholesome.I found myself reaching for gadgets, innovative food products/ingredients, and easy cheats that dont compromise on flavour. I saw a gap in the market for an Indian cookbook that reflects the way we live now  for busy people, who dont have much help in the kitchen and want to get wholesome, delicious food on the table for friends and family.The design aesthetic of contemporary India was also important for me to reflect. The Western view of India is all elephants and paisley, despite the beautiful, minimalist Indian design I have been enjoying. We were keen to capture the texture and colours of handloom, architecture and nature in the look and feel of the book.How did you go about curating the dishes?I started with mealtime moments. We Indians love our breakfast, and there is a huge trend of lazy brunches, so that had to be a chapter. I also love entertaining, so feasts needed to feature. Then I included family favourites from my homes in Calcutta and London. A lot of recipes from Delhi feature, where my mum is from and where I worked briefly. Then there are several Bengali recipes. But importantly, we were a cosmopolitan bunch and recipes from other communities featured too. I am very influenced by Gujarati food, for instance, and I travelled extensively in Kerala, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and even researched Calcutta food. So recipes from there feature too.Masala has many anecdotes from your childhood, involving your grandfather Jyoti Basu. What was your relationship with him like?It was like any other relationship between a doting grandfather and his besotted granddaughter. Dadu called me his crown princess and was keenly interested in my academic and other achievements. When I participated in a beauty contest and came last, it didnt stop him from driving his convoy straight to our home and chanting beauty queen, beauty queen as he came up the stairs to see me. He looked so glum in photos but he sprung to life and smiles when he was around us. When I got married, his one concern was that I would give up my career. So I think hed be proud that I have not one but three full-blown ones, including motherhood!Any food memory from your childhood that comes to mind?Sunday lunch was a big tradition at our home (in Salt Lake). I always remember lazy afternoons with lilting Bollywood tunes, vodka cocktails for the grown-ups, my dad (Chandan Basu) stirring slowly and the kids filling up on chanachur while lunch took ages to cook. I also have not-so-fond memories of driving my mother crazy at mealtimes. I was a very fussy eater and skinny child. My poor mother oversaw the most amazing food, which I would reject without even trying. I did eventually grow out of it though, as is probably evident!An easy version of burgers  Chappli Kebab Picture from Mallikas InstagramIn the book, you mention that you have been influenced by your maternal grandmother a lot...Nani is a proper matriarch with Afghan blood in her. She was actively involved in our parenting and a strong influence on food, culture and others. I used to travel with her to Delhi for my winter holidays and have the best time. She gave up non-vegetarian food when she lost her husband, but still cooked excellent chicken curry. Thanks to her, I enjoyed the best of Delhi home cooking  rajma chawal, kadhi pakora, gajar methi, and parathas stuffed with absolutely everything.I called her when I was writing Masala and we had an awkward conversation, as she is hard of hearing, until I asked her for her recipe of nimbu ka achaar. She sprung to life and after much testing, the recipe has now been perfected for modern kitchens and is in my book.To be honest, I had all manner of busy people in mind. A lot of my followers are young families, professionals without kids and silver surfers who are enjoying their kitchens and cooking in a new way. I live in London, so some of the recipes do need to be adapted for international kitchens but its never complicated and nothing an instinctive regular cook cant manage. I know a lot of Indians who move away from home to study, or to get married or for work. They buy my book because they find the recipes are so doable and always taste right.In the age of quick tutorial videos, do you see a cookbook being relevant?Absolutely. Quick tutorial videos are great, but there is only so much you can cram into a short video. Cookbooks are increasingly being bought for longevity, because they offer something over and beyond just recipes. A video tutorial can never replace that.Is cooking a passion or is it just a hobby or something more?All of the above. I find it very relaxing and often cook after a long day to unwind. But more than that I am passionate about addressing misperceptions about Indian cooking that exist. Its not as complicated, difficult and time consuming as people think. Thats what got me writing about food. All you need is know-how, great recipes and a fantastic cookbook.Channa Dal, Mustard Prawn Curry, and two favourites  Peas Pulao and Saag Aloo Picture from Mallikas InstagramAt home, what kind of cooking would we find in your kitchen?I often use my own cookbook, so thats very much the kind of Indian food you would eat if you came to my home. I love other cuisines, and so Indian dishes take pride of place alongside Chinese, Japanese, Persian, Italian and much more. My family loves variety; the kids especially are gourmet babies, with a very wide-ranging palate and love for food and cooking. So its a mixed bag. The food is always wholesome, well balanced and simply cooked.What kind of influence does your husbands half-Peruvian and half-British heritage have on your cooking?I was quite lucky that Peruvians like flavour and lots of chillies! I never had to tone down our spicier dishes for him... We met at university in London through Gujarati friends and the rest, as they say, is history!How much of Indian culture are your kids exposed to?They call themselves half-Indian and love dressing up in their festive Indian clothes and eating Indian food. I often make dosas and chillas at home for weekend breakfast, which they eat before you can wink. And they love going on holiday to India. Sadly, I havent been great at teaching them Hindi or Bengali. Still they are only small so there is hope!How do you make time for this alongside a career in communications?They say if you want something done, give it to a busy person! But seriously, I have been very blessed with the support of my husband, my family and friends. I also gave up a full-time role in communications in favour of consulting, so I now have a portfolio career that allows me the flexibility of enjoying my day job and indulging my passion. Hopefully, I am living proof of my own unique difference  that I am a busy home cook writing delicious recipes that work for other busy home cooks.What is next in the cooking space for you?I am still busy promoting the book and it is such a labour of love that I am trying to slow down and savour every minute. Watch this space for my next venture!Macchli Curry (Simple Fish Curry) Source: MasalaRecipe for Macchli Curry(Simple Fish Curry) (Serves 2-4)Coated in turmeric and chilli and simmered in a gently spiced curry, this is a very simple way to enjoy fish with the lightest of spices. Fish in India comes from both the fresh waters of its lakes and rivers and from the sea. Although foreign varieties such as basa are gaining popularity in restaurants and supermarkets, the morning trip to the fish market for the catch of the day remains a firm tradition in the fish-loving states. In Bengal, for instance, this is traditionally a job for the man of the house, who prides himself on his masterful bargaining with the sellers.

5ce6e139e8e3fc56af415af6,There are more than a 100 varieties of pasta!,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/food/there-are-more-than-a-100-varieties-of-pasta/cid/1675208,2018-11-14,,Telegraph,"Chefs Piero Ditrizio (left) and Simone de Siato after the masterclass at the IIHM Calcutta Gourmet Studio Pictures: Arnab Mondal and Rashbehari DasIIHM Calcutta signed an MoU with Intrecci and Campus Etoile Academy. To mark the occasion, a specially curated evening of Italian Gastronomy  Il Tavola Italiano, was organised. We spoke to the two Italian chefs -- Piero Ditrizio and Simone de SiatoWhat is a typical meal like in an Italian home?Simone: When it comes to Italian cuisine, regions have major roles to play. Everything we eat at home is totally dominated by the region we are in.Piero: In the south of Italy people eat a lot of eggplant. You will find heavy use of olive oil in the southern part, whereas in the north, the use of butter is more. So food varies according to the region. Nowadays you will find chefs creating and fusing different regions in the food they make but predominantly, Italian cuisine is about following and sticking to tradition.What are the must-have ingredients in Italian cuisine?Simone: Tomato, olive oil, basil, parmesan, balsamic vinegar, mascarpone and pasta. One of the most prominent features of the cuisine is that everything is fresh, so that you get the real taste of the ingredients. South of Italy uses a lot of rice while the use of wheat is more in the northern region. One thing common to both the regions is tomato.What lies behind the appeal of Italian cuisine?Piero: Italian cuisine is quite simple. The ingredients are low-fat and theres no overcooking involved. Olive oil is good for health. The use of butter is minimal.What are the different kinds of pasta?Simone: There are more than 100 varieties! This again depends on the region. You can make 10 different types of pasta with a single dough. Making pasta is something we learn at home as a child. Everything is handmade, rolled by hand too. There are two main types  fresh and dry. Dry pasta is industrial pasta. Its made with semolina flour and the quality of semolina is very important. If the texture of the pasta is smooth, it isnt good. It should be a little rough so that it can retain the sauce. The temperature at which pasta is dried is important too. Pasta should be dried at a low temperature. The more time it takes for the pasta to dry, the more time it takes to cook and the better is the mouthfeel. Fresh pasta is anyway rough because its handmade.Do Italian families bond over cooking?Piero: Family is something that plays an important role, it forms the base. Recipes from grandmothers and mothers are preserved in Italian households. The traditional recipes are important to us, be it for pastas or pastries. Even if I make my own creations, its important to form the base which has its roots in the traditional recipes and ingredients.Any myths you would want to bust about Italian food?Simone: We have many other desserts other than Tiramisu, like Baba with Rum. Also, we dont eat as much cheese as people think we do. People go for pizza once a week, it isnt something that we eat all the time."
5ce6e18be8e3fc56af415b3e,"Gene-edited food is coming, but will shoppers buy?",http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2018/nov/14/gene-edited-food-is-coming-but-will-shoppers-buy-1898217.html,2018-11-14,,The New Indian Express,"By Associated PressWASHINGTON: The next generation of biotech food is headed for the grocery aisles, and first up maybe salad dressings or granola bars made with soybean oil genetically tweaked to be good for your heart.By early next year, the first foods from plants or animals that had their DNA ""edited"" are expected to begin selling. It's a different technology than today's controversial ""genetically modified"" foods, more like faster breeding that promises to boost nutrition, spur crop growth, and make farm animals hardier and fruits and vegetables last longer.The U.S. National Academy of Sciences has declared gene editing one of the breakthroughs needed to improve food production so the world can feed billions more people amid a changing climate. Yet governments are wrestling with how to regulate this powerful new tool. And after years of confusion and rancor, will shoppers accept gene-edited foods or view them as GMOs in disguise?""If the consumer sees the benefit, I think they'll embrace the products and worry less about the technology,"" said Dan Voytas, a University of Minnesota professor and chief science officer for Calyxt Inc., which edited soybeans to make the oil heart-healthy.Researchers are pursuing more ambitious changes: Wheat with triple the usual fiber, or that's low in gluten. Mushrooms that don't brown, and better-producing tomatoes. Drought-tolerant corn, and rice that no longer absorbs soil pollution as it grows. Dairy cows that don't need to undergo painful de-horning, and pigs immune to a dangerous virus that can sweep through herds.Scientists even hope gene editing eventually could save species from being wiped out by devastating diseases like citrus greening, a so far unstoppable infection that's destroying Florida's famed oranges.First they must find genes that could make a new generation of trees immune.""If we can go in and edit the gene, change the DNA sequence ever so slightly by one or two letters, potentially we'd have a way to defeat this disease,"" said Fred Gmitter, a geneticist at the University of Florida Citrus Research and Education Center, as he examined diseased trees in a grove near Fort Meade.GENETICALLY MODIFIED OR EDITED, WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?Farmers have long genetically manipulated crops and animals by selectively breeding to get offspring with certain traits. It's time-consuming and can bring trade-offs. Modern tomatoes, for example, are larger than their pea-sized wild ancestor, but the generations of cross-breeding made them more fragile and altered their nutrients.GMOs, or genetically modified organisms, are plants or animals that were mixed with another species' DNA to introduce a specific trait  meaning they're ""transgenic."" Best known are corn and soybeans mixed with bacterial genes for built-in resistance to pests or weed killers.Despite international scientific consensus that GMOs are safe to eat, some people remain wary and there is concern they could spur herbicide-resistant weeds.Now gene-editing tools, with names like CRISPR and TALENs, promise to alter foods more precisely, and at less cost, without necessarily adding foreign DNA. Instead, they act like molecular scissors to alter the letters of an organism's own genetic alphabet.The technology can insert new DNA, but most products in development so far switch off a gene, according to University of Missouri professor Nicholas Kalaitzandonakes.Those new Calyxt soybeans? Voytas' team inactivated two genes so the beans produce oil with no heart-damaging trans fat and that shares the famed health profile of olive oil without its distinct taste.The hornless calves? Most dairy Holsteins grow horns that are removed for the safety of farmers and other cows. Recombinetics Inc. swapped part of the gene that makes dairy cows grow horns with the DNA instructions from naturally hornless Angus beef cattle.""Precision breeding,"" is how animal geneticist Alison Van Eenennaam of the University of California, Davis, explains it. ""This isn't going to replace traditional breeding,"" but make it easier to add one more trait.RULES AREN'T CLEARThe Agriculture Department says extra rules aren't needed for ""plants that could otherwise have been developed through traditional breeding,"" clearing the way for development of about two dozen gene-edited crops so far.In contrast, the Food and Drug Administration in 2017 proposed tighter, drug-like restrictions on gene-edited animals. It promises guidance sometime next year on exactly how it will proceed.Because of trade, international regulations are ""the most important factor in whether genome editing technologies are commercialized,"" USDA's Paul Spencer told a meeting of agriculture economists.Europe's highest court ruled last summer that existing European curbs on the sale of transgenic GMOs should apply to gene-edited foods, too.But at the World Trade Organization this month, the U.S. joined 12 nations including Australia, Canada, Argentina and Brazil in urging other countries to adopt internationally consistent, science-based rules for gene-edited agriculture.ARE THESE FOODS SAFE?The biggest concern is what are called off-target edits, unintended changes to DNA that could affect a crop's nutritional value or an animal's health, said Jennifer Kuzma of the Genetic Engineering and Society Center at North Carolina State University.Scientists are looking for any signs of problems. Take the hornless calves munching in a UC-Davis field. One is female and once it begins producing milk, Van Eenennaam will test how similar that milk's fat and protein composition is to milk from unaltered cows.""We're kind of being overly cautious,"" she said, noting that if eating beef from naturally hornless Angus cattle is fine, milk from edited Holsteins should be, too.But to Kuzma, companies will have to be up-front about how these new foods were made and the evidence that they're healthy. She wants regulators to decide case-by-case which changes are no big deal, and which might need more scrutiny.""Most gene-edited plants and animals are probably going to be just fine to eat. But you're only going to do yourself a disservice in the long run if you hide behind the terminology,"" Kuzma said.AVOIDING A BACKLASHUncertainty about regulatory and consumer reaction is creating some strange bedfellows. An industry-backed group of food makers and farmers asked university researchers and consumer advocates to help craft guidelines for ""responsible use"" of gene editing in the food supply.""Clearly this coalition is in existence because of some of the battle scars from the GMO debates, there's no question about that,"" said Greg Jaffe of the food-safety watchdog Center for Science in the Public Interest, who agreed to join the Center for Food Integrity's guidelines group. ""There's clearly going to be questions raised about this technology.""SUSTAINABILITY OR HYPE?Gene-editing can't do everything, cautioned Calyxt's Voytas. There are limitations to how much foods could be changed. Sure, scientists made wheat containing less gluten, but it's unlikely to ever be totally gluten-free for people who can't digest that protein, for example  or to make, say, allergy-free peanuts.Nor is it clear how easily companies will be able to edit different kinds of food, key to their profit.Despite her concerns about adequate regulation, Kuzma expects about 20 gene-edited crops to hit the U.S. market over five years  and she notes that scientists also are exploring changes to crops, like cassava, that are important in the poorest countries.""We think it's going to really revolutionize the industry,"" she said."

Identifying with the undistinguished common man, however, comes to them only during 'demanding' situations like an election campaign.The current election is also throwing up some interesting situations involving leaders from across the spectrum joining the man on the street to do what the latter are doing.Ironing clothesFor example, during the last one month of campaigning, the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) candidate for Adilabad Assembly constituency, Jogu Ramanna, who is Forest Minister in the caretaker Cabinet, was seen selling tomatoes in Quila area or ironing clothes at a laundry in Chota Talab locality or playing Boddemma or Bathukamma with women in localities like Kolipura in Adilabad town. Our people are happy to receive these leaders though they are visiting the locality only after four-and-a-half years,"" Aindla Chinna Lasmanna, a resident of Chota Talab generalised as he dwelt upon the trend of leaders personally calling upon voters during the run up to the election.""For the next five years, they will not even roll down the window glasses of their cars to acknowledge our presence,"" he added rather philosophically. There are other leaders too who have tried their hand at shaving while seeking votes at a hair dressers shop or made rotis using firewood while visiting slums. The voters are definitely amused but it is anybody's guess if such gestures influence them.Setting the trendThe trend of politicians indulging in activities which show them as caring personalities was laid by Eenadu Telugu daily in 1982 when it started publishing pictures of thespian N.T. Rama Rao breaking bread with poor families in their meagre homes or taking bath at a road side bore-well during his maiden campaign in the 1983 election for Andhra Pradesh Assembly.The pictures were received well by the public at large, evident from the fact they supported the Telugu Desam Party headed by the actor-turned-politician in that election.In the 2014 election, senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh had extended a helping hand to a tea seller who had set up his push cart at Boath village in Boath (ST) Assembly constituency during his party's election campaign. His action is still remembered by voters of the village."

They were not getting adequate price during the lean period. The government should take initiative to set up a perfume unit in Panaimarathupatti to benefit these farmers.Similarly, Mecheri and surrounding areas were famous for tomatoes. The tasty Mecheri tomatoes had good demand even in the neighbouring states. The setting up of a tomato juice manufacturing unit in Mecheri would immensely benefit the farmers in improving their livelihood.Yet another resolution demanded creation of additional infrastructure in the Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital.The government should remove encroachments from its lands and provide the same as free house site pattas to the weaker sections, and initiate steps to protect the handloom and powerloom units situated in and around Jalagandapuram.P.

The Mandsaur police firing that killed five farmers will be reinvestigated if Congress comes to power, it says.For the first time, Congress promises to launch a Ram Van Gaman Path tour to retrace Lord Ram's footprints in MP, pass a law to protect River Narmada and set up a new 'religion and spiritual department'. It also aims to begin commercial production of cow urine and cowdung cakes. Unlike Chhattisgarh, it hasn't called for prohibition but vows to rid MP of 'intoxicants'.To address upper-caste resentment after amendment of the SC/ST Atrocities (Prevention) Act, the Congress Vachan Patra promises a Samanya Varg Ayog or Commission for general categories to address their issues.The manifesto was released at the state Congress headquarters here on Saturday morning by PCC chief Kamal Nath, state election campaign chairman Jyotiraditya Scindia, former CM Digvijaya Singh, Leader of Opposition Ajay Singh, and former Union ministers Suresh Pachauri and Arun Yadav. Chairman of the manifesto committee Rajendra Singh was also on dais.Congress described it as the voice of people of Madhya Pradesh. There is something for just about everyone  daily wagers, jobless, industrialists, homemakers and even journalists (a law to protect mediapersons), but the focus is clearly on farms and job creation.Kamal Nath told reporters, Congress is not releasing a manifesto for the people of the state. Rather, this is our pledge to bring Madhya Pradesh back on the tracks of development so that farmers can smile, women will feel protected and youth can get employment. In the last 15 years, BJP presented only jumla patras (propaganda deeds) in the name of manifesto and deceived people. Congress is determined to end corruption and mafia rule which starts from villages.Scindia called it a a new morning after 15 years of darkness for farmers, women and youth. Congress has presented its resolution, not just a manifesto, out of the willingness to serve. We have promised progress and development, plus reduction in price of petrol and diesel, justice for slain farmers of Mandsaur and distribution of free laptops to meritorious students in every district. Women will be given priority during recruitment in police force. Industry will be promoted so jobs are created. And all this will be implemented with a specified time limit.Apart from agricultural loan waiver up to Rs 2 lakh, Congress promises 50% waiver on electric bills for agrarian sector, grant of Rs 51,000 for marriage of young women, and salary subsidy of Rs 10,000 to firms to encourage employment generation and investment. The manifesto assures passing a law for right to housing. Rest houses will be built every 15km along the Naramda Parikrama route.The Vachan Patra says that if Congress comes to power, it will bring transparency in recruitments and appointments and Vyapam  which has been in the eye of a storm for eight years  will be shut down. Congress alleges the BJP governments involvement in Vyapam irregularities.Congress manifesto promises more than the BJP governments policies at the Centre and state. While chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan promised bonus on grains like wheat and dal, Congress promises to give bonus to farmers on practically every major crop grown in the state  wheat, paddy, jowar, bajra, corn, soybean, mustard, cotton, arhar, moong, gram and masoor, urad, garlic, onions, tomatoes and sugarcane. The Narendra Modi government in Delhi gave LPG connections to the poor through Ujjwala Yojana, and Congress promises Rs 100 subsidy per cylinder. It plans to raise social security pension from Rs 300 per month to Rs 1,000.We are going to the people with a new thought process, to give the state a new direction, said LOP Ajay Singh."

But we had a look at the manic traffic, and changed our minds. Just the day before, I had been caught in the traffic for what seemed like hours. So, I decided that Id look up Zomato and order something exciting from our part of town.A few minutes of surfing later, I zeroed in on what looked promising  a delivery outlet called Rendezvous Calcutta in Noida. I called up and was told that it has been around for a while, has mostly Bengali food and delivers through Swiggy.Fresh and well-cookedI had an interesting chat with Chef Madhumita, who runs the place (phone numbers: 0120-4267726 and 8826743456). The food is all prepared fresh, so they have to be given some time to cook and deliver. The recipes are authentic, she said, and brushed off one of the Bengali food delivery places that I rather like as not genuine. And she helped me choose our order. We decided on a plate of dhokar dalna (Rs. 160), aloo posto (Rs. 145), shukto (Rs. 145), bori-aloo maachh jhol (Rs. 255), maachher kalia (Rs. 210) and tomato chatni (Rs. 70).The food came within the hour. And we had a delicious lunch, for the dishes, as the chef had promised, were fresh and well cooked. I had the dhokar dalna, which is a dish of steamed besan cakes in thick gravy that I really enjoy. It was superb; the cakes were soft, and the gravy was nice and tasty. I like my aloo posto with more posto (khus-khus, or poppy seed paste) than aloo, but in many kitchens it is cooked the other way around. In Rendezvous, too, it was more of a potato dish than posto. But it had a nice flavourful taste.The shukto, which is usually a cooling summer dish of vegetables in a light sauce, was delicious. It had a mix of vegetables, and the right balance of mildly sweet and bitter tastes. The two fish dishes were outstanding. There were large chunks of potato and fried bori (lentil balls) in bori-aloo maachh jhol, while the maachher kalia gravy was rich and sumptuous. The fish was fresh, and the pieces were large. Most of the gravies were hot, which I enjoyed after months of a low chilli diet. The tomato chatni, however, wasnt all that exciting. I must say Ive had better.Elaborate menuI didnt try out the meat dishes, but will order in another day. They have kosha mutton (Rs. 210), railway mutton (Rs. 375), chicken rezala (Rs. 375) and chicken curry (Rs. 360). There are other kinds of fish dishes, too  such as pabda tomato jhal (Rs. 240) and shorshe pabda (Rs. 230). Vegetarians can try out the aloor dum (Rs. 120), phul kopir dalna (Rs. 145), doi potol (Rs. 145), chholar dal (Rs. 100) and begun bhaja (Rs. 50). They have biryanis and rolls, breakfast fare such as radha bollobhi (stuffed puris with aloo) and snacks such as fish fries and chops.Madhumita tells me that she is not a trained chef, but has always been interested in cooking. She used to be a marketing professional, and then decided to get into the food business. I am glad she did!"

In Thuppaki , we saw that when Vijay gets the help of his fellow army men to stop terrorist attacks happening across the city.In Kaththi , we saw it when Vijay ropes in senior citizens to stop water supply to the city. Even in the recent Spyder, we saw the hero (Mahesh Babu) getting the help of housewives to stop a crime.Sarkar has a long run-time but lacks that one Brand ARM sequence that could have changed the tone of the film. At 163 minutes, it comes across more like a political pamphlet.Vijay is named Sundar Ramaswamy in the film and it looks like his name was coined by mixing the names of Googles CEO and Chennais firebrand activist who has traffic for a sobriquet. Hes globally renowned to be a corporate monster who takes over companies wherever he goes, but hes now in India to cast his vote. But theres a hitch: his vote has already been cast.That much has already been revealed thanks to the trailers, and the first half of Sarkar thankfully takes it one step further. Theres an evil politician (Masilamani, played by Pazha Karuppiah, and as clichd as they come) who is out to ruin the state. Can Sundar  with all his corporate experience (he calls himself a corporate criminal)  stop him from that? Can Sundars wisdom come in handy in rectifying malpractice that has become quite prevalent in Tamil Nadu polls?It is a promising premise and a much-needed one, considering that all of us yearn for change and development, but Sarkar just scratches the surface by putting together a story based on a few recent incidents in the State. It reels off laws and the electoral processes (theres an entire eye-opening-but-lecture-like stretch on Section 49P) just to support Vijays decision to stay back in Chennai and clean the system.The problem with Sarkar is that it has no well-defined characters. Keerthy Suresh has nothing much to do than keep walking with Vijay (literally) while Yogi Babu has a blink-and-miss appearance. It is Varalaxmi who steals the cake, essaying a smooth performance. Sarkar would have been better off had she been introduced earlier.The dialogues, though powerful, reel off much longer than they ought to be. What could have been said in two words: Go vote (admittedly a much-needed social message) gets the entire length of the film, replete with dance and fights.Theres an entire sequence featuring Vijay narrating the story of a tomato that got the claps, but looks oddly out of place. But in these dialogue-heavy sequences that Vijay gets into the act  his control over the emotional sequences is admirable, while hes aggressive in the ones that require him to go a little over-the-top.AR Rahmans songs dont help him much  except the call-for-revolution number Oru Viral, they dont contribute much to take the story forward.Watching Sarkar , I kept thinking of an earlier much-loved Murugadoss film, Ramana (2002), which had Vijayakant taking on corrupt officials. That had the protagonist as a professor but it is Sarkar that feels like the lecture."

The scheme was announced in the budget speech of 2018-19 with an outlay of Rs 500 crore to stabilize the supply of tomato, onion and potato (TOP) and to ensure availability of these crops throughout the country round-the-year without price volatility.Union food processing industry minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, in a press release on Monday, said, Price volatility of TOP crops wreak havoc in the households of this country. This scheme has been prepared after sustained talks with all stakeholders and we will ensure that the TOP crops reach all households in the country all through the year.She said the government had laid down special measures and grants-in-aid under the scheme to ensure enhanced production of TOP crops and to augment value chain. Operation Greens aims to enhance the value realisation of TOP farmers by targeted interventions. These interventions would range from strengthening of production clusters and farmer producer organisations (FPOs) and connecting them with the market to price stabilisation for both producers and consumers through a proper production planning. The measures would include introduction of dual use varieties, reduction in post-harvest losses by creation of farm gate infrastructure, development of suitable agro-logistics, creation of appropriate storage facilities linking consumption centres and increase in food processing capacities. Operation Greens also envisages setting up of a market intelligence network to collect and collate real time data on demand and supply and price of TOP crops.The ministry would provide 50% of subsidy on transportation of TOP crops from production to storage and hiring of appropriate storage facilities, the minister stated."

The prices of other vegetables too were hovering low and the cultivators lamented that it did not even meet their cost of transportation.A. Nagaraju, one of the farmers and who is part of the Raita Mitra company, blamed the APMC officials for being apathetic to the plight of the farmers.Though the Agricultural Price Commission has stipulated that the procurement price should never be below the cost of cultivation it is not implemented and the brokers and middlemen have a field day, he added.Airing concern over the developments, Mr. Nagaraju said only lip sympathy is given to the cause of the farmers but no practical initiatives are taken to bail them out of crisis. Vegetable producers have demanded storage facility with refrigeration, tie-up with food industry for direct procurement from farmers but none of it has been implemented, he added. The bulk of vegetables cultivated in and around Mysuru are brought to the APMC yard which receives produce from Kolar, Nagamangala, Mandya, Hassan and other places. In addition, Jayapura, Hampapura, H.D. Kote, T. Narsipur etc are other places in Mysuru district where vegetables are cultivated on a large scale."

I am always blown away by the quality of food and wine, informed, friendly service and charming down-to-earth no-nonsense Australian attitude to life. There is a humility and dignity which is refreshing and very new world. Sydney is the perfect first stop Down Under and what a foodie paradise it is!Start your journey on Singapore Airlines, not the national carrier Qantas. You wont regret it. Apart from the seamless service, great big seats and plenty of legroom, the food and drinks are outstanding. SIA has won the prestigious award for the Best Overall Wine Cellar 2017.If youre in the rarefied atmosphere of first class, they serve Krug 2004 Champagne and one of the best Aussie wines, a Pinot Noir from Paringa Estate. In business and in all the lounges, youll be very happy with the delicious Charles Heidsieck Brut Reserve. The food is designed by a panel of international chefs, so youll find Indian, Asian and Australian menus on routes Down Under and fabulous illy single-origin coffees, TWG teas, cocktails and mocktails, all served with a smile.Sydney SeaplanesReady for a bit of the high life? The luxury seaplane operator offers sightseeing tours in a classic Beaver aircraft. Whether its a scenic flight over the beautiful Sydney Harbour, a flying journey of the golden sandy Northern Beaches, a romantic picnic for two on a secluded beach, or the best taxi ride to one of Sydneys river or ocean restaurants  Sydney Seaplanes will get you there in style. They take off from Rose Bay, which you can reach by either taxi or even better, a lovely inexpensive ferry ride from Circular Quay. On a fine day, the dashing young pilots in shorts are happy to take you on a scenic tour of Sydney over the Opera House and Harbour Bridge, down along many of Sydneys beautiful northern beaches and harbours to our destination, which happened to be Whale Beach, a stretch of pristine white sand and spectacular views. It would normally take an hour or so to reach here by car from Sydney but in the seaplane it takes only 20 minutes.Tasmanian Pacific Oysters with rice wine vinaigrette at Tetsuyas, which is owned by Tetsuya Wakuda (below) Sourced by The TelegraphTetsuyas restaurantYes, believe it or not, there are some really world-class food experiences to be had in the city. One of my favourite fine dining restaurants is Tetsuyas, which combines a masterful blend of skill, artistry and taste. Tetsuya Wakudas attention to detail is consistent and beyond sublime. Signature dishes include the confit of Ocean trout, consomme of tomato and tea, Tasmanian Pacific oysters with rice wine vinaigrette, tuna with daikon and wasabi, sea scallops with lemonade fruit and yuzu, and the sashimi of hamachi (kingfish) with blood orange and vinaigrette.The petuna ocean trout dish has been served in the restaurant ever since it was a humble first-floor dwelling in a very ordinary suburb of Sydney. Tetsuya was the first chef to discover this fish and to source many wonderful products from all over Australia. Do not leave without trying the warm kombu bread and truffle butter served regularly in between courses. Not that you need any more food but this is a must-do. Tetsuyas only does a degustation menu  10 courses paired with world wines. There is no a la carte. Each dish is truly a culinary masterpiece. If you have the time, budget and inclination (youll have to reserve way in advance), dont miss it. Aus $240 pp for the whole experience.Bondi Beach Sourced by The TelegraphBondi BeachI heard plenty about Bondi Beach but had not realised that it has a sub-culture of its own. Its not just a series of serious beaches (Bondi/Tamarama/Bronte) but an area of great restaurants, cafes and shops which makes Bondi a real Sydney suburb worth talking about well beyond the hippie image it once had. Musts to visit in the area are Camilla for silk kaftans, Gertrude & Alice for books and coffee, and Icebergs for the most spectacular lunch overlooking Bondi Beach. Its not just a restaurant serving outstanding food (not surprisingly a huge variety of seafood and Italian), its a style statement. And dont forget to listen to Bondi 88 FM, the local radio station, while you are there.Jonahs offers an excellent view and seafood Sourced by The TelegraphJonahsPerhaps the only feature that can divert your attention from the stunning view at Jonahs is the exceptional food and wine offering. The award-winning hatted restaurant offers excellent contemporary Australian cuisine under the direction of chef Matteo Zamboni. They were the recipient of Australias Wine List of the Year Awards in 2017 by Gourmet Traveller with a cellar containing over 11,000 bottles of vintage Australian and international wines and a wine list of more than 1,600 different labels.Apart from the fabulous food and wine, Jonahs is a little luxury getaway with 11 beautiful rooms, all with stunning sea views, a spa and all the trimmings. The seafood platter for lunch which consists of a deck of raw and cured fish and oysters to crayfish thermidor and warm Coffin Bay scallops along with a glass of Aussie Arras sparkling, is a must-have. And yes, an added bonus is that you can spot whales as they migrate between May and November.Sydney Opera House Sourced by The TelegraphSydney Opera HouseGo for a guided tour or, even better, go see an opera at any of their six halls. Join the one-hour Essential Tour and see inside the World Heritage-listed House. Your guide will show you the theatres and stages where more than 1,600 performances come to life annually. Youll see some of the thousand rooms and 300 corridors of the building. Youll leave this tour with a fascinating account of the Houses history and architecture  its an exciting introduction to Sydneys vibrant performing arts scene.QT Sydney shares the building with two historical buildings, Gowings and The State Theatre Sourced by The TelegraphQT SydneyA new Australian brand of hospitality, QT Sydney had a much-anticipated opening this year and is the only Sydney hotel to be a member of the exclusive Design Hotels. Rocking the city with their edgy, quirky design, happening F&B spaces, bars and beautifully decorated contemporary rooms, QT Sydney shares the building with two of the citys most majestic historical buildings, Gowings and The State Theatre. The eccentricity of the hotel is offset by the historical features of the building, such as the blend of gothic, art deco, and Italian-influenced architecture. Although I didnt stay at the QT, the vibe intrigued me as I walked in off the busy and bustling Market Street where most of the high-end shopping, restaurants and bars are. I was hoping that quirky didnt stretch to the bedrooms and was pleasantly surprised at the comfort level of their spacious rooms. Apart from this, it seems to be the place for the wild, wacky and cool crowd to party.A salad of spring peas stracciatella, smoked almonds, rye crumble, asparagus and tomato chutney Sourced by The TelegraphBennelong RestaurantUpmarket yet relaxed, Bennelong Restaurant is an absolute treat for lunch. The bar is literally under the Opera Houses shell vaulted sails with spectacular views over the Harbour Bridge. The restaurant with huge glass panels overlooks Circular Quay and the Harbour. The menu is based on award-winning chef Peter Gilmores vision of Australian cuisine. Incidentally, he also runs the other culinary icon in Sydney, Quay restaurant which is just opposite. You can choose from a two- or three-course a la carte menu with service starting early, catering to the pre-theatre dining crowd. Dishes to go for are the salad of spring peas, smoked almonds, asparagus and tomato chutney; wild cape york barramundi and the mooloolaba yellowfin tuna with kohlrabi remoulade. Benelong offers 180 of the countrys favourite and small-scale wine labels from an eclectic collection of winemakers. This is quintessential Sydney for me.An usual evening at Bennelong Restaurant Sourced by The TelegraphSydney fish market Sourced by The TelegraphSydney fish marketFirstly, unlike many fish markets I have visited round the world, it doesnt smell fishy. The variety of Australian seafood alone is quite staggering  from Tasmanian giant abalone and crabs weighing 17kg to prawns, crayfish, Moreton Bay bugs, marons, Balmain bay bugs (all Aussie crustaceans), rock lobster and, of course, oysters galore. Each fishmonger in addition to selling fish has ready-to-eat dishes, including sushi, lobster thermidor and shucked oysters. If that isnt enough, there are plenty of restaurants both within the market and outside where you can enjoy a seafood lunch in comfort.On the first floor is the Sydney seafood school, which conducts cookery classes. On certain days of the week, they also have master classes by Sydneys top chefs. Although most of the classes are over $100 for a two- or three-hour class, lunch or dinner and a glass of wine is included. For someone who really enjoys cooking, this is a must-do. Classes run throughout the week but there seems to be a better choice over the weekend. Check for substantial discounts if youre a group of six or more.Hyatt Sydney Sourced by The TelegraphRock a 180-degree viewLocation. Location. Location. Whoever said that must have been thinking about the Hyatt Sydney. Right opposite the Opera House, under the Harbour Bridge on the edge of the fashionable area known as The Rocks, the Park Hyatt is the place to stay in Sydney if you want a view to beat all views. Choose one of the suites on the circular front of the hotel and youll have a 180-degree view of the Opera House as your 25ft electric curtains draw open. It also has one of the citys nicest restaurants on the ground floor facing the boardwalk and Sydney Harbour.Karen Anand is a culinary consultant, food writer and entrepreneur.

5ce746b3e8e3fc56af41853d,A moveable street feast in Calcutta,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/a-moveable-street-feast-in-calcutta/cid/1673726,2018-11-03,,Telegraph,"A walk down a sidewalk in Calcutta is like walking down a buffet line, writes Christine Kaaloa on her food blog, Grrltraveller. The entry reads: This city is phenomenal when it comes to street food. Some hawkers practically work and sleep in their stalls. Each morning, they wake up and prepare food, hot, spicy and savoury for the hungry passers-by.Calcutta has close to 2,00,000 street food vendors serving over 10 million people daily with over 250 varieties of dishes  soft-boiled duck egg sandwich, uttapam, malai kofta and dal butter fry with masala kulcha or missi roti, dudh puli, sarpuria, whatever not.A recent survey conducted by travel portal booking.com has declared Calcutta the top street food hub of India, ahead of Amritsar, Delhi, Ahmedabad and even Mumbai.Serenaded by honking cars and buses amid smoke and dust, these vendors have been carrying on for decades. Profits are minimal, but sales volumes keep them going.Indira Chakravarty, a public health expert, whose studies on the citys food vendors have led to policy changes at various levels, tries to get street food vendors to cater whenever she organises seminars and conferences.Her reason: street food is safer because vendors rarely store food. As a consultant with the Food Safety and Standards Authority, she has seen how a lot of hotels store meat, poultry and non-vegetarian items for as long as six months. A street vendor prepares food in the morning and by evening everything is sold out, says Chakravarty, who is now chief adviser of West Bengals public health engineering department. As if to underline her point, she orders toast, omelette and peyanji  an onion pakoda variant  from a vendor near her office in Dalhousie Square.Chakravarty has conducted surveys of Calcuttas street food on behalf of the All India Institute of Health and Public Hygiene (AIIHPH), whose results have been feted by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization. The verdict: The spread is tasty and highly affordable. At the time of the survey, in 1995, hygiene standards needed improving.That has changed, Chakravarty says. Our members try to maintain standards and learn the basics of food safety, says Anadi Saha, general secretary of the Hawker Mens Union and Hawker Sangram Committee. He adds, We have had workshops organised by AIIHPH experts.Though much has been done, much remains to be achieved. Vendors dont have a clear idea about harmful artificial colours  like the carcinogenic metanil yellow used in jalebis  or spurious food additives. Neither do they know that deep frying in the same oil is bad for health. But the biggest bugbear seems to be the lurking extortionists with their continuing threats of ousting vendors.We are trying to fix all these, says Saha, who is looking forward to the civic bodys suggestion of setting up smart food kiosks. Vendors have also been promised ID cards and medical insurance coverage.THE FOOD WALK*8.30am  Madan StreetOn the footpath adjoining the Hindustan Building of the Life Insurance Corporation of India, brothers Barun and Bholanath Den have just set up their breakfast stall. Sitting atop an earthen stove is a frying pan, which exchanges place occasionally with a wire mesh laden with thick slices of bread. The frying pan is for the eggs. Most office-goers demand two slices of bread with a boiled duck egg cut in half and sprinkled with salt and pepper. Those with more time on their hands often opt for a half boiled egg, cut open and smeared on the bread and covered with a drizzle of finely chopped onions.Our father set up the stall in 1978 when this was a small market for radio, transistors and their spare parts, says Barun as he shells a hens egg with the end of a teaspoon. His dexterity and speed is such that the shell comes off as a continuum. A massive flood had destroyed our village, Amta, 50 kilometres west of Calcutta, says Bholanath as he passes a piece of toast to his son, who then slathers on it much butter and sprinkles sugar.Insurance agent Chandan Bhowmick says, I leave home at 7.30am. Theres no time for anything. I eat breakfast here and wash it all down with a bhaanr of tea. The eggs and toast cost Rs 20 and the tea, Rs 5.The Den brothers feed about 700 people every day till 8pm from Monday to Saturday. By evening everything is sold out, says Barun. Nowadays we are getting orders for office picnics and from film production units, he adds proudly.E. Chandran Swami's south Indian food stall Prasun Chaudhuri*9.30am  Crossing of Princep Street and Ganesh Chandra AvenueE. Chandran Swami has been selling south Indian food at his kiosk here since 1968. I came in 1961 from Kilalkulam near Madurai. I was 14, he reminisces as he pours batter with one swift circular motion on a square tawa. He didnt learn to make idli, dosa and uttapam in Tamil Nadu. He learnt it all at a south Indian joint here. Seven years later, he set up his shop. Today, at 70, he is helped by his grandsons.Sanjoy Roy wolfs down a masala dosa (it costs Rs 50). He is a clerk employed with a private firm that deals in automobile parts. You must try his special tomato-onion uttapam, he tells us while dipping pieces of dosa in crimson chutney. You wont find this special chilli-garlic chutney anywhere in Calcutta.Chandran cooks all the food early in the morning at his rented house near New Market with the help of his wife, daughter and grandsons. He arrives at the kiosk sharp at 9am on a cycle van. He takes special care to store the coconut chutney and other perishables in ice boxes during peak summer. The cheapest item at his kiosk is a single dahi vada, which comes for Rs 17. The most expensive item on his menu is mixed cheese butter uttapam  it costs Rs 65. Of late, hes been getting a lot of contracts from school canteens.Every day, at 6pm he shuts shop, purchases a Tamil newspaper and heads for the Maidan. There, lying on the soft grass, he reads leisurely the days news. It is a stale serving this, but thats how he likes it.Rajneesh Walias foodstall Mission Dhaba Prasun Chaudhuri*2pm  Ganesh Avenue and Mangoe Lane crossingWhen we reach Rajneesh Walias foodstall Mission Dhaba, there is already a large crowd around the tandoor. About 40 people, including several cab drivers, are milling around. The plates in their hands are laden with dal makhani, chana, paneer, kulcha and pulao.Gopal Das, who drives a yellow taxi, says he lunches here at least four times a week. My order seldom changes, he says. I take half plates of chana masala, dal makhani and raita, alongside two tandoori rotis. All of it comes to Rs 60. We take a cue and place the same order. The dal makhani has a lovely smoky taste. The masala kulcha is as soft as a pillow. And the Rs 14-a-plate raita has pineapple and pomegranate in it.Rajneesh cooks the food with a couple of assistants at a small shop on Mangoe Lane. He says, My father, Surjit Singh Walia, started this 20 years ago. But this half-plate variety is my innovation.Rajneesh has started getting orders to cater for weddings and private parties. No advertising and all, he says matter-of-factly. Its mostly word-of-mouth.Bablu Kanta Ghosh has been selling Bengali sweets on the pavement near the India Coffee House for nearly 50 years now Prasun Chaudhuri*4pm  Meredith Street and Central Avenue crossingAfter a heavy lunch, its time to wrap up with some desserts. Bablu Kanta Ghosh has been selling Bengali sweets on the pavement near the India Coffee House for nearly 50 years now. I learnt my craft at a sweetmeat shop in Howrah, says Bablu. He himself hails from Haripur village in Hooghly district, 35 kilometres north of Calcutta.From Monday to Saturday, he stays at Bowbazars Chhana Patty, the hub of cottage cheese. Chhana is the basic ingredient of most Bengali sweets. Bablu prepares sweets that are not easily available at sweetmeat shops  malpua, labanga latika, bel morabba and darbesh.The bel morabba is a big hit with those who have problems with their morning constitutional.I make these myself and bring it all here in a hand-pulled cart, says Bablu. He also sells rasogolla, chhana pora, lyangcha, rasomalai and a variety of sandesh sourced from Hooghly. Sweets from Hooghly are far better than those you get in the city, he says. During winter months he sells nalen gurer sandesh and rasogolla.Sunirmal Bose, a 65-year old office peon working at a travel agents office, is one of Bablus oldest and most regular customers. I am a big fan of his malpua and labanga latika, he says. During Vijaya Dashami, I take a whole lot of these home.Every Saturday, Bablu leaves for his village. A sweet end to a mixed week."
5ce74784e8e3fc56af418596,Parading Pondy’s French connection,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/parading-pondys-french-connection/articleshow/66468118.cms,2018-11-02,,The Times Of India,"This story is from November 2, 2018Download The Times of India News App for Latest CityChennai: A man spewing fire, women in elegant gowns and bright red or gold masks covering their faces and young boys dressed up as animals  the Masquerade festival on the streets of Puducherry is a continuation of a vibrant French tradition.Celebrated four times a year on such special occasions as French Republic Day (July 14), World Peace Day (November 11), Christmas Eve and New Years Day, it provides a glimpse into the remnants of a culture that youngsters in the Union territory want to hold on to.Initially a religious entertainment event held by the French, it soon developed into a platform for the performing arts. In colonial times, only the French were allowed to take part in the dance accompanied with music. After the French left, the Creoles and Topazes did not allow the festival to be forgotten. And later the Tamils began to nurture it.The origin of the masquerade, which simply means ""an attempt to deceive people about the true nature or identity of something"", dates to the New Testament of the Bible and to the betrayal of Judas. It is believed that when the chief priests and the elders met in the palace of Caiaphas to plot the arrest of Jesus their problem was how to identify Jesus. It was Judas Iscariot, one of the 12 disciples of Jesus, who volunteered to help them. Today, the followers of Jesus put on different masks so that ""no henchman of the priests who take up arms against the ideals of Jesus would ever be able to identify them"". The wearers of masks parade themselves on the streets, symbolically braving Judas Iscariots.The masquerade, simply meaning ""putting on a mask and dancing"", also has a psychological undertone as well. It is born of the human feeling that one is safe in hiding. The speciality of this dance is that no two participants wear the same sort of masks which symbolizes that every individual has a distinct identity.In Puducherry, the masks are not just of men and women. It is like a fancy dress party where tigers, lions and dogs jostle with tomatoes, potatoes and brinjals in a merry procession. Some also go for body paint.

Otherwise, not only do you lose on nutrition but there are also chances the food may turn toxic, leading to several disorders and illnesses. Lets take a closer look at the cookware used in Indian kitchens.Chopping boardMost people use a plastic one but the problem with plastic boards, even branded ones, is that chopping creates grooves that can harbour harmful microbes such as E. coli and salmonella. These germs get into cooked food via the next lot of sliced vegetables. Contamination is even more likely if the same board is used to chop meat or chicken. Worse, these bugs are so stubborn that even cooking may not kill them. Switch to wooden or rubber chopping boards and replace them every year.Aluminium utensilsBecause these vessels are oxidised, there is little chance of the aluminium leaching into food. Aluminium wrap, on the other hand, can leach metal if the food stays in it too long, especially if the dish has tomato, lemon juice or vinegar. A study in the Journal of Alzheimers Disease reported cases in which leached aluminium had led to Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases at a relatively young age. The US-based Agency for Toxic Substances and Diseases Registry (ATSDR) features aluminium prominently on its list of 200 toxic items. Switch to packing food in parchment paper. Wax-coated parchment paper is as effective as aluminium foil.Non-stick cookwareThese are extremely useful as they aid low-fat cooking and are easy to clean. The non-stick coating debuted as Teflon, which was later followed by several clones. In recent times, some of these new materials have been found to be associated with a host of diseases such as dyslexia and infertility. Improper use of these utensils compounds the problem. For instance, cooking over high heat or damaged coating can make these pans unsafe. You should use non-stick pans with great care or sparingly.Stainless steel vesselsQuality stainless steel looks good and there is barely any leaching. What there is  iron, manganese or chromium  can actually take care of possible mineral deficiencies. However, one ingredient is harmful  nickel. Dont scratch the utensil with scrubbing aids such as steelwool. A scarred surface would leach nickel.Iron woksTo me, iron pans may look ugly and, sometimes, the food you cook in it becomes black, especially if you cook sour items. But even if iron does get leached into food, its good for those who have anaemia. However, if any family member suffers from blood disorders such as polycythaemia and thalassaemia, iron in food can be harmful.PlasticwareHot food in a plastic container can get contaminated with the material, leading to heart diseases, infertility, some brain ailments and even cancer. A recent Harvard research also showed that BPA  found in certain types of plastics, especially that used to make water bottles  plays a key role in weight gain. Melamine is not as bad as plastic but it too gives off toxic substances when it comes in touch with steaming hot food. Do not use melamine containers to heat food in a microwave (even if labelled for use in microwaves).CeramicwareThis is perhaps the best cookware material. It can withstand high heat and be used in an oven, a microwave and even broiler. It is also good looking.Bone china and porcelainThese products are light and pleasing to the eyes. They can be used to heat food in the oven but are best used to serve food in. However, some porcelainware is embellished with gold or silver. Such pieces cannot be used in the microwave. The only problem: chinaware is fragile and needs careful handling.Earthenware and stonewareIn olden times, rice was cooked in earthenware. But earthenware as well as stoneware are liable to crack with sudden changes in temperature. Some people use stoneware crockery. However, you cannot use earthenware or stoneware in microwave ovens."

But even as they speak, memories of the times he spent at GM long ago come flooding back to him. Lata, meanwhile, tries to solve the blown-fuse problem before heading off to soothe Molly, whose meticulously laid plans are on the verge of unravelling.On the days that his mother worked late, Josh Sen, custodian of the plum-headed parakeets Optimus Prime and Max, would convince his dad, distinguished professor of something very important but difficult to remember, to drive by the Kharkai and Subarnarekha rivers. Not that Vikramjit needed much convincing. He loved the Marine Drive (though he would have preferred a different name, one which did not invariably occasion the patronising Oh yes, the other Marine Drive nod-and-head-bob from Bombaywallahs).Sometimes they would chat  updates about ones birds or the others students were exchanged  but, mostly, Josh would roll down the window (something his mother never allowed since the breeze interfered with her hair), stick his head out, and let the wind slap noisily against his cheeks. His father, who had grown up with dogs, delighted in his sons canine behaviour, folded up the sleeves of his Brooks Brothers shirts, and sang along to the radio. Eventually, they ended up at Brubeck, back in the city, and gorged on cakes. Tilo monitored Joshs refined sugar intake during the week strictly, but father and son had perfected the art of operating on a strict what-Tilo-doesnt-know-cant-hurt-Tilo principle.Should we check in on Pixie and her folks? Vik asked Josh that evening, after they had completed their usual run and turned towards the city again.Josh took his time to reply. He could be reflective after his drawing class.Before or after we order the cake? Josh asked finally.If we go before, we could take some cakes for them. If we go after, we could bring Pixie with us to Brubeck. And order the cake then. It all depends on how hungry you are now.Not hungry. Miss gave us lots of cookies, Josh replied. His drawing teacher was a flaky young Parsi artist who lived in one of those beautiful rambling colonial buildings and seemed to survive only on cookies and milk, which she set out before her students as she randomly showed them great works of art projected on the living room wall. The kids adored Miss Daruwalla.Dont mention the cookies to Ma though. She might give Miss...A lecture. I know. What happened to your healthy snack, by the way?Josh rummaged in his bag and extracted a little tiffin-box, in posh blue chrome, and presented to his father. Vik, who had his own chrome blue box in his bag somewhere, quickly wolfed down the cold quinoa cutlet with its side of home-made tomato relish. He could not stand quinoa and the coldness settled like an icy chrome-blue feeling in his stomach, with angry red lashings curling around it, like memories of the tomato relish. Lets go over to their guest house then and see how Pixie is settling in?Josh handed his father his water bottle, also chrome blue.Is Pixie going to be invited to my birthday? Josh sounded neutral enough.I am sure, Vik replied, allowing the water to unglue himself from that feeling, handing the bottle back to his son and starting the car. In fact, Tilo has probably already invited them. Why?She will go on and on about London. And my friends will find her lame.Now now, Vik said, accelerating the car.And then we went St James Park, and then we had tea with the Queen, Josh mimicked Pixies accent, in an accurate if cruel fashion. Maybe shell expect an Enid Blyton kind of high tea? With meringues and potted meat and ham and sardines and jam tarts.Vik narrowed his eyes and looked at his son.Josh Sen, is that what you want?Whaatt? Josh said innocently.***Several well-appointed flats, airy and central, had been turned by the company into a group of serviced apartments, which offered greater privacy to long-term residents than the old-fashioned guesthouses. A centralised hospitality desk offered luxuries such as room service and turn down (which, since shed had to pick up after everyone in London, felt like an unbelievable luxury to Nisha) and the kitchen provided food which, while not exciting, was adequate.One such apartment, off Kadma, was currently occupied by the Das Biswas-es, and its living room, with white walls, regulation sofas and severe landscapes, was currently caught in a terrific squall. Nisha was firm. The polka-dotted puppy who had been found under the mango tree must be returned to that spot. She had a toddler; she was not going to get another creature to look after; she was already at the verge of a nervous breakdown.But I am going to look after him myself, Mama, I promise, I promise, Pixie wailed. And Lisa Didi can help me. Lisa was the nanny. She lurked in the doorway and followed the war. She had fed some milk to the puppy and was on his side.Lisa Didi has her hands full. So do I. We will go back and return the puppy. I cant believe you smuggled him in when we expressly told you not to!Nishas face was thunderous. Bappa hovered around the flat  unable to take a stand  and had now decided to escape inside and call up admin to find out about the serviced apartments policy on pets.Pixie, equally firm, announced that if the puppy was going back to the mango tree, so was she. Lisa Didi, pack my bag, Pixie called out.Nisha couldnt decide what she should be madder about. The damn dog. Or her daughter ordering about Lisa so blithely.Pixie, Nisha began ominously when there were footsteps outside and the bell rang.Bappa reappeared, phone glued to his ears, and breathed a sigh of relief after he opened the door.Vikramjitda, welcome, welcome. We have a bit of a situation here. In fact, you can help! Come in please. Hello, Josh.The puppy, meanwhile, had hopped off Pixies lap and wandered towards the door.Woofwoof, he said to Josh.Woofwoof, replied Josh in return.Pixie snatched him up.I didnt know you had a dog, Josh said, as he came and sat next to her.She doesnt, Nisha said coldly. That dogs going.She forced herself to smile at Vik. Tea? Coffee? No Tilo?Having gauged the situation, Vik decided that it was better he sat. The puppy cast its soulful eyes on him. I wouldnt mind some tea, he said, But only if its no trouble. Tilo is working late today. We were going to Brubeck and thought wed take Pixie along if thats okay.Tea is no trouble, Nisha replied and made her way to the kitchen.Whats his name? Josh whispered, conspiratorially.Scone, Pixie whispered back.What? Josh narrowed his eyes exactly like his father.S-C-O-N-E, spelt out Pixie, now no longer whispering, Its pronounced scon, like don, not scone like cone.Josh digested this.Meanwhile, Scone Das Biswas had laid his little puppy head on Joshs knee. Despite his dislike for Pixie gathering up again, into a pulsating ball of annoyance, Josh couldnt help but fall a little in love with the polka-dotted creature, who wasnt a patch on his birds of course, but was, nonetheless, a delightful thing to love. He stroked his velvety ears gently. And that Pixie did not say anything to that. Instead, she looked beseechingly at her father and his friend. Soon, fat tears rolled down her cheeks one by one.***It was around 11.30 that Nisha returned to their bedroom. She was freshly showered. Though shed dried her hair, a few curls were still damp and clung to her cheeks. Postos asleep, she said and sat at the dressing table, applying cream on her cheeks.Nisha smiled at Bappa in the mirror and a load lifted off his chest.So is your daughter and that Scone. He is ensconced  or should we say en-scone-d now?  in her bed. Lisa is sitting there looking at him adoringly. I hope she still pays attention to Posto!Nisha got under the duvet and folded her body against her husbands.So your friend Vikramjit is quite the convincer. Should have gone into law!He was a famous debater baba, Bappa replied, taking her hand in his, leaning in to her. Long day, today, he said.Nishas hair smelt all coconut-y and familiar. Bappa felt himself descend into the sort of semi-comfortable space that might just develop an edge and lead to some (long, overdue) action.How much do you think professors earn at that B-school? Nisha asked him.Sorry, what? Bappa said, a little surprised at this new turn.Vikramjit and Tilottama  how much do you think they earn?Hmm, said Bappa, considering the matter.To be continued"

This will impact vegetable production after the next two-three months. The tomato prices may rise to Rs 80/kg in April next year, he said.Vilas Shinde, managing director at Sahyadri Farmers Producer Company Ltd, said, Vegetable plantations have already dipped in vegetable growing regions. Our sources in nurseries, which provide vegetable plants to farmers for planting, are reporting a 50% dip in their October orders.He said the area from Nashik to Marathwada , including Aurangabad and Jalna, may see a dip in vegetable plantation mainly, the effect of which might will become apparent as early as December. A 30% dip in vegetable produce is expected in the near future as vegetable planting has already begun dipping. Some effect on vegetable production in eastern Pune might also be seen, in locations like Indapur, Baramati and Solapur , Shinde added.Gadhave said places that do not have canal irrigation facilities were witnessing a dipping water table in October, a phenomenon which usually occurs in January. Farmers may, therefore, refrain from sowing vegetables, he said.He said most areas in the state recorded less rainfall this monsoon. It is due to this reason that Western Maharashtra, where a bulk of vegetables are grown, may also see a dip in production. No impact on potatoes, however, is expected as most of its production will happen before January 2019, he said.A state horticulture department official said the state government has declared a drought-like situation in 128 talukas, reporting trigger 2 conditions. A bulk of vegetables in the state is produced in regions with canal irrigation. However, the regions where this form of irrigation is not available may see an impact of the water scarcity , a situation which may worsen in January and February, he said.Another state horticulture department said the water situation is not that severe in major vegetable producing regions, such as Pune, Satara, Kolhapur , Sangli, Sangamner, Nashik, west Ahmednagar, which fall on the west side of the state, as the dams are full in the Western Ghat region."

However, market research department at the Tamil Nadu Agriculture University (TNAU) said tomato prices were likely to improve after the onset of northeast monsoon.A price advisory from the university attributed the drop in the prices to steady arrival of tomato to local markets from Karnataka. Once the monsoon sets in, transport of the crop from the neighbouring state might get hit and as a result tomato prices might go up in the state.Tomato is being sold at Rs 19-Rs 23 per kg in retail stores and markets, while the farm gate price is around Rs 11-Rs 13 per kg. However, maintaining and harvesting the crop is labour intensive and heavy rain had led to some spoilage, Veerappa, a farmer from Thondamuthur, said. We need at least 15 per kg to sustain ourselves.The major tomato producing districts in the state are Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri, Salem, Tiruppur, Theni and Dindigal."

Food Processing Industries Federation president P. Bhaskar Rao said Chittoor had been the leading producer of tomato in the State and had a substantial share in the national market.But, since it is a perishable commodity and the farmers and also entrepreneurs are struggling to earn minimum returns from it, the Union government has stepped in to alleviate their plight. The ODOP scheme is applicable for processing industries in food parks established by both the Central and the State governments.Tremendous scopeLike all other agriculture and horticulture crops, only about 5% of tomato is processed, which provides a tremendous scope for venturing into the business of adding value to it.Food parksMr. Rao pointed out that the Andhra Pradesh government was promoting 12 food parks with its own budget in addition to the Central government-sponsored Srini Food Park in Chittoor and Mallavalli Mega Food Park in Krishna district and the one dedicated for aquaculture namely the Godavari Mega Aqua Food Park at Bhimavaram in West Godavari district.Processing unitsIn all, 20 to 25 food parks had been sanctioned by the Centre across the country, but the State had taken the task of promoting the processing units upon itself by setting up its own parks in view of the great importance of the rich variety of crops to its economy and the livelihood of lakhs of farmers."

5ce7a0eee8e3fc56af41a735,A Star Is Born is big-feeling cinema,https://www.telegraphindia.com/entertainment/a-star-is-born-is-big-feeling-cinema/cid/1672675,2018-10-26,,Telegraph,"A Star Is Born is such a great Hollywood myth that its no wonder Hollywood keeps telling it. Whatever the era, the director or the headliners, it relates the story of two lovers on dramatically differing paths: a famous man whos furiously racing to the bottom (Bradley Cooper in this movie) and a woman (Lady Gaga) whos soaring to the top. This latest and fourth version is a gorgeous heartbreaker (bring tissues). Like its finest antecedents, it wrings tears from its romance and thrills from a steadfast belief in old-fashioned, big-feeling cinema. That its also a perverse fantasy about men, women, love and sacrifice makes it all the better.Like the last iteration, the epically (empirically!) terrible 1976 remake with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, the new one takes place in a contemporary music world that is by turns exciting, suffocating and crowded with dangers  ravenous fans, crushing performance demands, celebrity itself. This is the world that has helped create and come close to ruining Jackson Maine (Cooper), a country-rock musician who, when the movie opens, is performing obviously wasted, leaning and nearly falling into a boot-stomping song. Hes a beautiful ruin adrift on an ocean of booze, one he routinely spikes with pills.A singer with a voice that can thunder, Ally Campana (Lady Gaga) becomes Jacks safe harbour, taking on the roles of lover, partner, muse, ideal. Thats a heavy burden, but Ally is one of lifes chin-up survivors, with an errant mother and a loving, larger-than-life father, Lorenzo (a terrific Andrew Dice Clay), whose dreams cloud her own. Dad runs a limo business out of their Los Angeles home, where his male colleagues (Barry Shabaka Henley, among others) and their boisterous camaraderie fill the rooms, both warming and crowding them. Ally is accustomed to navigating around men larger than she is, elbowing past them to be seen and heard.She and Jack first meet late one night in a Hollywood drag club where she sings after her waitress shift ends. Jack has just finished playing a concert and, after polishing off a bottle of booze, has stumbled into the club for more. There he watches Ally belt out the Edith Piaf standard La Vie en Rose, in a sheath and upsweep, her arched artificial brows adding quizzical punctuation to her face. In a swoon, he invites her out that night, and, as flirtation gives way to deeper feelings, they fall in love. He brings Ally onstage and then on tour, but she eventually goes solo, becoming a star whose ascent is shadowed by his decline.Cooper, who also directed, does a lot right in this take on A Star Is Born, beginning with the casting of Lady Gaga, whose disarming, naturalistic presence is crucial to the movies force. A post-Madonna pop artiste known for her elaborate stagecraft and costumes, she has been stripped down here, her mask removed. You can see her skin, the flutter in her veins, which brings you close to her, and can make both the actress and her character feel touchingly vulnerable. This unmasking of Lady Gaga also makes Ally seem genuine, authentic, a quality that the movie champions and that serves as a kind of thematic first principle.Soon after Jack and Ally meet, he peels off one of her fake brows  hes flirting, but hes also saying that he sees the real her and wants the world to as well. Playful yet unapologetically earnest, this scene inaugurates a seduction  of Ally, of us  that lasts the exhilarating first hour. Cooper understands the power of big-screen myths, including thunderstruck love and near-magical lucky breaks. He also understands his own star appeal (he gives himself plenty of heat-stoking close-ups), which dovetails with his role as director. When Ally and Jack look at each other, youre watching two people fall in love, and its a contact high. Youre also watching a director guiding  creating  his star as life seeps into fiction.Coopers smartest decision, other than casting Lady Gaga, is the absolute sincerity with which hes taken on this material, in all its gorgeous, gaudy excess. He has refurbished the story some and added a bit too much psychological filler, but he has stayed true to its fundamental seriousness. Winking at this story would have been easy, but would have destroyed it. Instead, working from a script he wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, Cooper has gone all in with big emotions and cascades of tears. (The movie owes a debt to, and nods at, the original 1937 film as well as the 1954 remake with a peerless Judy Garland.)Part of whats exciting about this A Star Is Born is that Cooper knows hes telling one of the defining Hollywood stories and has given the movie the polish and scale it merits. He plays with intimacy and cinematic sweep, going in close when Ally and Jack are together so that the world falls away  a scene of them in a parking lot shows how conversation turns to courtship  only to then pull back so we can see the enormity of the world the lovers inhabit once Jack takes Ally on tour. And while the crowd seems little more than a surging blur the first time Jack plays, when Ally looks at the throng, she sees it and so do we.The concert scenes of Jack and Ally performing are revved up but personal. (The production borrowed crowds from actual music festivals like Coachella, and their sheer size conveys the scope of Jacks stardom.) Cooper sings pleasantly enough and throttles an electric guitar with persuasive fervour. Hes backed by the group Lukas Nelson & the Promise of the Real (Lukass dad is Willie Nelson). The music mixes standards with new songs, some written by Cooper, Lukas Nelson and Lady Gaga, whose supple, often electric singing can, at full throttle, express intensities of feeling far better than the dialogue.Like many filmmakers, Cooper sometimes explains too much. It isnt enough that Jack drinks; Cooper wants us to know why. So, he fleshes out Jacks past, turning melodrama into therapy and robbing the character of mystery. One of the weakest scenes, a violent confrontation between Jack and his much-older brother, Bobby (Sam Elliott, whose deep drawl Cooper has borrowed), is an information dump. In one of the finest, Bobby just wordlessly drives away from Jack, and Elliott lets you see the ferocity of the brothers love - and their pain - in eyes that have begun to water and in a stone face that will shatter.Cooper spends more time on the storys male lead than previous iterations have, perhaps because hes taken the role himself. The focus on Jack  he scrapes bottom, goes into recovery  somewhat weighs down the remainder of the movie, partly because too much of it is overly familiar. At times, Cooper seems to share Jacks unease with Allys stardom, particularly after she connects with a manager (Rafi Gavron, oozing sleaze) and transforms from a soulful crooner into a writhing automaton with soulless beats and backup singers. Ally puts on the mask that Cooper has removed from Lady Gaga, suggesting that  unlike Jacks  her art is less than pure.Male self-aggrandisement is baked into the storys foundation but not ruinously. Jack doesnt just help turn Ally into a star, giving her the big break she needs. His trauma  shes insecure, but hes damaged  becomes a deep well that she draws from, allowing her to become a greater artist. In part, the story is as creaky as that of Pygmalion, the male sculptor who turns a beloved carving into a woman. Yet one of the pleasures of A Star Is Born in all its renditions is that it is also about a woman whose ambitions are equal to those of any man and who steadily rises as she weeps and sings toward fabulous self and sovereignty."

We are already No.1 in the country in papaya, mango, banana and chilli crops and will soon become a horticultural hub, he said.Recalling the upheaval among farmers due to the glut and the resultant lack of remunerative prices for mango, turmeric, chilli, jowar and maize in the last few years, he emphasised on looking beyond the traditional farming practices and embrace new technologies both to cut down cost and overcome the vagaries of monsoon.The amount spent towards market intervention fund by this government in the last four years is Rs. 3,800 crore against the paltry Rs. 340 crore spent by the previous government during 2009-14 for the combined State, he pointed out.Dig at CentreThe State government did go the extra mile by increasing the quantum of support during disasters, he said and flayed the Centre for remaining nonchalant. We tripled the quantum of support for the 4.7 lakh coconut trees uprooted in Uttarandhra region during the recent Titli cyclone, without waiting for the Centre. It is always the State government that is answerable to the people."

The company, which already has brands like Sugar Free and Nutralite, the addition of Complan and Glucon-D, is expected to strengthen its equity in the consumer wellness segment. Further, its range of skincare products under Everyuth is also expected to be complimented with the inclusion of Nycil.Apart from the four brands, ZWL will also get two large manufacturing facilities in Aligarh and Sitarganj and teams devoted to operations, research, sales, marketing and support. Heinz India has a strong distribution network of over 800 distributors, more than 20,000 wholesalers covering 29 states.Among these brands, Heinz India recorded revenues of about Rs 1,150 crore for the 12 month period ended June 30.

Nineteen schools in Kozhikode are also part of Sanjeevani.Organic seedsAs part of the programme, differently abled children will sow organic seeds and nurture them. The project had begun as initiatives of the district missions in Malappuram and Thiruvananthapuram and is now being expanded Statewide.In Malappuram, the project began as Thalir in 15 schools in August last year. This year, it has been scaled up to cover seven more schools. Growbags, compost, and seeds are given to the Buds schools for children to cultivate.The children plant seeds of ladys finger, tomato, brinjal, long beans, chilli, and other seeds; water them; remove weeds; and harvest the produce with the support of their teachers, parents, and Kudumbashrees joint liability groups.The project was inspired by the tapioca yield in a few schools. It was then decided to start organic cultivation of other crops as an activity for the children to keep them active, and bring them close to nature, Mr. Haskar says.At the Cherukavu Buds school, the Kudumbashree has introduced a form of drip irrigation using PVC pipes that ensures that all the plants are watered using less water and the children are not taxed much either. This year, at Kondotty, they are growing plants in 40 growbags on garden stands besides on a plot of land.Mr. Haskar says vegetable cultivation is an activity that could be done even at home once the children get a hang of it. Completing various jobs such as watering plants or removing weeds helps develop their concentration. It could even evolve into a source of livelihood for them in future.Besides growbag cultivation in Alappuzha, Idukki and Kozhikode, farming is being done by children in two cents or more of land near the Buds schools. In total, 345 cents of land is under vegetable farming.The maximum area under cultivation is in Kollam-68 cents, Mr. Haskar says. Thrissur followes with 64 cents, while Malappuram has 50 cents."

On the sidelines of the launch of the new season of her audio chat show #NoFilterNeha on Saavn, t2 chatted with the actress about cravings, maternity leave and the #MeToo movement.What an incredible year youre having, both professionally and personally. Hows the pregnancy treating you?Very well, in fact. I always wondered, What will I do when I get pregnant? and now that I am pregnant, I am doing exactly what Ive been doing throughout  I am working, I am exercising and socialising. Every pregnancy is different. If there are women who want to stay home through their pregnancy, I respect that. If there are women who want to go out there and work, Id tell them to get up and do it.Everyone whos pregnant has talked about weird cravings. Have you had any?Yes. In my first trimester, I was doing Roadies. I was living in a tent and Id be craving raw tomatoes with lime and salt. In my second trimester, I only wanted bhindi and roti, and this is my third trimester and I want to each chicken and rice all the time. I am talking to you but all I can think of is when Ill get to eat chicken and rice! (Laughs) The only things I have had to give up are eggs and chocolate.Between your husband Angad Bedi and you, whos reading all the baby books?Neither of us. We will be the kind of parents who will take each day as it comes. We dont have a single parenting book or have enrolled for any classes. I am in my eighth month and my doctor has told me to continue doing what I am doing. The idea is not to change my daily routine too much. My mom keeps telling me, If you are strong enough to give life, then get up and do the work you want to do.Have you been getting a ton of advice from people?Yeah and its very boring and I dont want it. Please dont give me advice. People are constantly trying to tell me if I am having a boy or a girl. I am told if my stomach is a certain shape, it means its a boy or a girl. And really, I am not interested.This is the third season of your show and you have Angad as a guest. What was it like to interview your husband?Thats a big one for me. It made me nervous. In the previous years, interviewing Karan (Johar) always made me nervous because he is a talk show host but this year, talking to Angad was nerve-wracking. When you are talking to your husband, you dont know where to draw the line and thats exactly what happened when we were recording. We ended up talking for two hours!Youve always talked about Shah Rukh Khan being a dream guest. Would he be on the show this year?Unfortunately not! We were in conversation but hes not doing interviews right now, so I guess next time.Over the three seasons, apart from Karan Johar, whos been your favourite guest and why?Every year theres one guest who surprises me. My biggest surprise this year has been Harbhajan Singh because hes literally done a lot of spin bowling in the comments that he made. And then last year, it was Rishi Kapoor who I was very fascinated with. Apart from Karan, the one guest who cracked me up the most was Farah Khan.You do audio, youre on television, you also act in films  is there a medium that has your heart?This ones very, very close because I am a producer and the host. Donning many different hats makes me feel like I have achieved a lot at the end of one season. But nothing gives me as much satisfaction as making a film. I have Helicopter Eela thats released recently and which I am very excited about.We (Neha and husband Angad Bedi) will be the kind of parents who will take each day as it comes. We dont have a single parenting book or have enrolled for any classes (Agencies)Are you are planning a maternity break after this?Errrr I dont know. I am hoping to keep working until the last day. And then I bring a new life into this world and then get back to work as soon as I can. Again, I dont think there is any such thing as a bad parent; one that gets back to work is just as amazing as the one who stays at home to nurture. I dont know which one of these Id be.Keira Knightley recently wrote an essay about pregnancy and the pressures that society puts on women to look perfect immediately after birth. In the past there has been a lot of scrutiny on Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Kareena Kapoor Khan regarding their post-baby bodiesShame on people who fat-shame new mothers. The most important thing for me is that I am feeling healthy. Will I get disturbed with peoples opinion on my body after I deliver my child? I dont know.There is always pressure on us in the public eye. But I also know that the first couple of months after a woman gives birth, her life is turned upside down. You feel like a wreck and if you look like one, its totally okay. This is the most beautiful time in a mothers life and how you look or dont should be the least of your worries. I hope that I can remind myself this every day. And if I forget, then my mother or husband remind me because their opinion matters the most in my life.Is Bollywoods #MeToo movement a long time coming?Of course. We need to clean up the industry. It makes me very angry that people are questioning the women who are coming forward. At the same time, I am very happy that women are talking. It takes a lot of courage. You cannot turn a blind eye when someone comes forward. When someone shares their story, you have to support them, no matter what. Whether I bring  a daughter or a son  into this world, Id want to teach them these right values."

Photo: Indranil Bhoumik/MintNew Delhi: Production of horticulture crops like vegetables and fruits is likely to touch a record 305.4 million tonnes (mt) in 2017-18, about 1.6% higher than the previous year and 8% higher than the previous five years average, the agriculture ministry said in its first advance estimates released on Tuesday.The final estimates for 2016-17 released alongside showed that production of these perishable crops was 300.6 mt, a year-on-year rise of over 5%.Within horticulture, production of vegetables is estimated at 181 mt in 2017-18, about 1% higher than the year before, while that of fruits is estimated at 95 mt, 2% higher than the previous year.Data showed that during the year, area under different perishable crops stood at 24.9 million hectares, about 0.3% higher than the year before. Between 2015-16 and 2017-18, productivity of horticulture crops rose from 11.7 tonnes per hectare to an estimated 12.3 tonnes per hectare.Disaggregated data on estimates of production of specific crops showed onions at 21.4 mt, about 4.5% lower than the year before, and potatoes at 49.3 mt, marginally higher than the 48.6 mt in 2016-17. Production of tomatoes is estimated to rise 7.7% year-on-year in 2017-18 to 22.3 mt, showed the data.The record production during 2017-18 will mark the sixth straight year of horticulture production outstripping that of foodgrains (estimated at 276mt in 2016-17), suggesting a structural change in Indian agriculture where farmers are increasingly growing perishable commercial crops due to a growing market and a quicker cash flow as these crops require less time from sowing to marketing.However, price volatility continues to be a major risk in horticulture, with prices of onions, tomatoes and potatoes plunging below growing costs several times last year. While farmers in Madhya Pradesh were forced to sell onions as low as Rs2 per kg in June last year, in northern India, farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were forced to dump their potato crop for want of buyers around the same time.Retail and wholesale prices of perishables are also at a large variance from each other, implying fragmented markets and poor cold chain facilities. For instance, while tomatoes are currently selling for as low as Rs2-4 per kg in wholesale markets in Andhra Pradesh, they are retailing at Rs35 per kg in Delhi."
5a581ffe9855b770e038337c,Over 100 years of whisking away B’lureans,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2018/jan/10/over-100-years-of-whisking-away-blureans-1750276.html,2018-01-11,,The New Indian Express,"BENGALURU: For anyone who has grown up in Bengaluru, before the mushrooming of various bakery chains and outlets, the iconic Iyengar bakeries, found around every street corner, were go-to spots for the softest sponge cakes, fresh buns and crispy puffs. The heady aroma of bread being brought out of the oven would envelop the entire locality, a smell that takes many back to carefree childhood days.Over the years, people have moved on to fancier bakeries, but those loyal to Iyengar bakeries, some of which have crossed the 100-year mark, continue to be customers, sometimes traveling far off to their favourite one, or waking up in the wee hours to get a fresh batch of buns.Bakeries places to socialise in Colonial timesCity-based historian Arun Prasad says that the art of baking dates back to the time of the Roman Empire, and was eventually popularised by the British, who took the art to the countries they colonized. In Colonial times, bakeries were primarily spaces to socialize, he says.British army officers brought cakes and cookies from England to India. Though it is hard to trace the exact history, it is certain that it was the Iyengar community, who learnt baking from the British, that brought bakeries to the city, and these became popular for their high quality, hygeinic food, says Prasad.2)Owner of BB Bakery with fresh vegetable toast3)Oldest Iyengar Bakery in city, BB Bakery, Kengeri4) Sreenivas with his wife at the bakery5)Chocolate chip cookies fresh out of oven at BB BakeryHe says that these Tamil-speaking Iyengars travelled to different parts from the Hassan district  one theory is that they came looking for jobs, the other is that there was a draught that forced them to relocate. This sect of Iyengars are called Hebbar Iyengars, and were followers of Ramanujam. They were also referred to as Ashtangrama Iyengars, owing to the fact that they were from eight different villages within the Hassan district. Though the period of migration is uncertain, it is known that these Iyengars were employed by the British for various jobs  some in administrative posts, others as helpers on private estates, which is how they learnt how to bake. Despite being a vegetarian community, they started using egg for baking purposes.After the 1950s, Iyengar bakeries became popular throughout the city, and the community became known as bakery Iyengars or bread Iyengars. However, several other people, outside the community, opened up these bakeries by banking on the same name, says Prasad.First Iyengar bakery in city estd in 1898Prasad says that there was a theory that the first Iyengar bakery in the city was started in the 1890s by a family from Hassan, and was a sweet shop before it became a bakery.Shedding some light on this is Pavithra, whose father, Sreenivas, runs BB Bakery, apparently the first Iyengar bakery in the city, started in 1898. Pavithra says that her great grandfather Thirumalachar, ran a sweet shop in Chikpet, and was taught how to bake bread by a British man, whose name is unknown. After buns, Thirumalachar started selling bread and cakes too.My father was never inclined towards studies, and despite his fathers hesitance towards him joining the business, he decided to take over, and I plan on carrying on the legacy after him, says Pavithra, adding that the buns are their most popular item till date, as their size and taste make them very unique and sought after.Though BB Bakery moved out of its old home in Chikpet, due to issues with the owner, and has relocated to Kengeri now, Pavithra says that loyal customers, some of whom have been visiting for the last 50 years, still come all the way. She says her father wakes up at 5am everyday, at his age, to ensure his customers get fresh buns. Despite him not being keen on his three daughters taking over, they dont want the over-a-century-old family business to die out.6)Hot and crispy vegetable puffs at BB Bakery7) Famous bun-butter-jam at Iyengar Bakery, Austin Town8)Sreenivas stacking baked goods at BB Bakery9)Freshly baked buns at Iyengars Bakery, Austin Town10) Loaves of bread at Iyengars Bakery, Austin TownWay forwardPavithra says that business has changed over the years. Earlier, people would pick up in bulk, but now, its become on a more day-to-day basis, where people pick up just what they need for that day.My father keeps experimenting and innovating now to keep the products selling. The tomato bun, pudina bun, kaju khara, choco-gems cookies and choco-strawberry cookies are newer items, and they have been doing well. My father just wants to keep his customers satisfied, she says, adding that to keep up with the times, her younger sister has started a Facebook page and rebranded the bakery with a new logo too.Raman and Lakshmeesha, brothers to run Iyengars Bakery in Austin Town, say that their father started the bakery back in 1981. The baked good they are known for are bun-butter-jam, plain cakes and nippat.We sell 250 products, from buns to namkeen to cakes. We have started online orders, and are the only Iyengar bakery that is doing this. But we have noticed that these days, people are picking up goods just for their daily requirements.Nostalgia all the wayFor Ruth Dsouza Prabhu, a food writer, her earliest memories of Iyengar bakeries go back to when she first moved here to work, about 18 years back. I would go to the closest Iyengar bakery before work for breakfast and pick up an aloo bun or a khaara bun, which is filled with a spicy mix of vegetables, and this would keep me satisfied for quite some time. The plain cakes are something I still pick up, and my daughter, who is extremely fussy about her food, tried this one first and that is how she took to eating cake  so I am thankful to Iyengar bakeries for this, she says.Prakash, 63, has lived in Bengaluru almost all his life, and Iyengar bakeries are part of his childhood in the city. As kids, we would go to the bakery and buy cream buns with the little pocket money we got  this was after school when all the neighbourhood boys would get together to play. Even now, some of my friends and I gather here in the evenings, some even bring their grandkids. But we dont eat cream buns anymore, he says laughing.Fakers stay awayOver the years, some people have started Iyengar bakeries without actually belonging to the community, which has resulted in legal issues. Raman says, People who arent from the community are using the name just to make their bakeries popular, they are not authentic. However, those who know which the authentic bakeries are, make sure they go only to the original ones, he says, adding that his only request to customers is to go to authentic Iyengar bakeries, and not take the others at face value."

Emotional abuse negatively affects a childs emotional development and is caused by withholding love or support for a child.In a survey, 36 per cent of Indian parents agreed to hit children as a form of punishment. 64 per cent of Asian (2-7 years) children are known to experience moderate to severe forms of abuse.Why is it a burden?Childhood abuse results in severe physical injuries, disabilities, poor cognitive and socio-emotional outcomes, behavioural problems, mental health issues throughout life and may lead to fatal outcome. Even mild forms of abuse pose children at risk of re-experiencing abuse. It is possible that it can evoke insecurity in a child.Neuroscientists who conducted brain imaging studies of children with history of abuse, have demonstrated long term abnormal brain changes in the areas related to emotion, motivation, attention and executive functions. Thus, quality of the relationship established in earlier life plays a fundamental role in development of social relationships and emotional regulation in later life.How can parents help?Support the child  Try to correct parent-child relationship, which in turn can prevent re-abuse, reduces parent-child conflict and reduces parental stress. This will improve family dynamics thus reducing child behavioural problems.Positive parenting - Understand right techniques to discipline your child rather than using physical means of punishment. Use of positive parenting skills which include positive reinforcement of child, trust building activities and spending quality time with the child are essential. In adolescents, it is a greater challenge as they frequently have lack of faith in the ability of family to help them handle aftermath of disclosure of abuse.Do not blame the child  Children who go through emotional abuse frequently give in to bribing or befriending the abuser due to fear of disclosure or guilt of being abused. Blaming the child will lead to double victimisation of the child, both by abuser and family.Be aware  Understanding a childs social network is very essential. Parents also have to be aware of online communication platforms that are now emerging as rampant forms of emotional abuse and exploitation of children and adolescents (eg Blue Whale app).Seek help  Children often use different ways to express when exposed to abuse including sudden onset school refusal, mood disturbances, aggression, sadness, anger outbursts, social withdrawal and acute decline in school performance. Look out for these symptoms early and seek professional help.Keep stigma away  Parents should keep stigma away when they identify need for support from a mental health professional. Parents should help the child regain their confidence. If the offender belongs to the family, measures to avoid repeated abuse should be taken.Provide good social support - It is very essential to develop good social support network that include parents, extended family, peers, teachers and professionals, as an abuse tends to create greater chance of a child or adolescent manifesting a psychiatric symptomatology later in life.

As the price for the day is announced disappointment is writ large on his face. At Rs80 per crate of 15kg, Tomato is threatening to bring tears in the eyes in this poll season for the farmers in this drought prone district.Good showers last monsoon had brought cheers for the farmers who had suffered consecutive years of drought. ""We can make some profit only if the price of tomato crosses Rs150 per crate and the price today will leave me incurring loss. With more farmers set to bring their produce to the market in the coming days I am really worried about the grim future. The price could fall below Rs50 per crate. It will be a disaster,"" adds Vishwanath Reddy, a tomato grower from Mangasandra village in Kolar.The familiar scene of farmers dumping their tomato produce on the roads as a mark of protest is likely to repeat, says Santosh, a tomato merchant who supplies tomatos from Kolar to not only places like Chennai, Kolkata, Rajasthan and other parts of the country, but even exports to Quatar and Pakistan. ""We are sending over 300 to 400 crates every day now to Quatar and Pakistan,"" claims Santosh.A perennially drought prone district, Kolar has carved a niche for itself in horticulture. The district is the main supplier of Mango and vegetables like tomato, cabbage, cauliflower and beans.We have been let down by our leadersWhile the tomato tale of tears is a recurring feature, the farmers of Kolar curse the failure of their leaders for letting them down in redressing their problem. ""We had agriculture ministers like C Byre Gowda, Srinivasa Gowda and now Krishna Byre Gowda from our own district, but without finding a lasting solution for our woes whether in getting water for our crops or ensuring a fair price and market for our produce,"" says Chandrappa who has branched out to sericulture apart from his tomato farming.Known as the district of 'Silk and Milk' for its strides in sericulture and dairy farming, the people are waking up for the electoral heat with their demands.""Setting up cold storage chains to store farm produce during the time of price crash, setting up agro-processing industries, speeding up projects like Yettinahole and Yarragolu ti bring water, giving push for industrial growth in the region,' tops our wish, says Chandrappa of Mudavadi village.The villages are already seeing the divide as the May 12 assembly election is approaching. In Mangasandra with a population of about 1000, the divide is clear between Above Poverty Line(APL) and Below Poverty Line(BPL) families and also caste divide between Vokkaliga, Kuruba,SC/ST and Minority communities. The Kolar constituency is witnessing tough fight between former agriculture minister Srinivasa Gowda of JD(S) and Syed Zameer Pasha of Congress. The Kuruba, SC/ST and Minority population is showing greater preference for Congress while the Vokkaliga and Reddy communities along with a few OBC castes are consolidating behind Srinivasa Gowda. While Om Shakti Chalapathy of BJP too is giving a fight, incumbent MLA Varthur Prakash of Namma Congress is determined to have the last laugh against his opponents from three bigger parties.While the BPL families are generally appreciative of Siddaramaiah government's welfare programmes, the APL families are miffed as they are not getting 30kg rice at concessional price of Rs10.Farming sustains the livelihood of about 60% of the population of the villagers, sericulture and dairy farming are drawing a large segment with hope of more steady income.Rain hits sweet dreams of Mango growersThe recent spell of rains and gale wings has hit the mango growers of Kolar and Srinivasapura. ""We had suffered due to a spell of untimely rains during the flowering season of mango. Just a couple of weeks back the fresh spell of rain and gusty winds has hit the crop,"" rues Chandrappa, a mango farmer in Srinivasapura.""Our yield is likely to go down by 30%. Now we are keeping our fingers crossed about the price we get,"" Chandrappa adds.Srinivasapura, the mango hub of the region is equally well known for its fierce political battle between Health Minister Ramesh Kumar and his arch rival Venkatashiva Reddy. The constituency has never seen its MLA score a repeat victory. It is always alternative terms for Ramesh Kumar and Venkatashiva Reddy here. Will Ramesh Kumar break the sequenced and humble Reddy again is the question that is being hotly debated in the constituency."

Your garden requires food and water. But,above all, it requires your love and affection, like your child, says 62-year-old PV Ramanna from Hyderabad. He started gardening in 1998. In the last 20 years, he has developed a number of hybrid plants over an area of 1,500 sq ft. He says, Gardening has been my hobby since childhood. When I used to work at ISCO fertilisers, I did not get much time to take care of my garden, but post-retirement, Im a full-fledged gardener. I could not be more content.His interests lies mainly in developing hybrid varieties of flowers. Lotus, jasmine, hibiscus, frangipani and lily plants have occupied a considerable space in his garden. He explains that flowers come in different shapes, sizes and hues. They are not just visually appealing, but enhance your mood too. A flower garden can be developed even by a novice with zero investment, he says. Apart from this, he has also developed an organic garden with vegetables and fruits.Vegetables include tomatoes, green chilies, lady fingers, eggplant and drumstick. He says, Planting a single tomato plant can give you 4 kgs of tomatoes in one entire season. By planting these in pots, you enjoy the pleasure of savouring delicious, sun-warmed vegetables fresh from your garden. Moreover, you dont have to go to the grocery store each time. Just pick the right spot, make sure the soil bed is not weed-ridden and there is plenty of sunlight.Mango, strawberry, pomegranate, banana, sapota are some of the fruits he grows. He makes sure the soil is free from pesticides and occasionally removes unwanted weeds. He has been using kitchen waste, dried leaves and cow dung to make compost. He spends around three hours in the morning and evening to water the garden. He has designed a rooftop water harvesting process that stores rainwater to water the plants, especially when there is water scarcity in the city.On his terrace garden, one can find a plethora of potted plants and birds. The potted plants are placed on a raised cemented platform. He says, Usually, the potted plants are placed on the terrace slab. The water draining out of these pots is wasted. I have designed cemented pots in such a way that the excess water flows into miniature tubs. Birds such as pigeons, crows, bulbuls and koels come here for their early morning bath. It is very pleasing and soothing to watch them, and the birds also stay hydrated during the scorching heat.The list does not end here. Ramanna also owns around eight aquariums with varieties of fish, including ten types of different coloured shrimp. He says that a garden is a major source of stress relief. He, along with his wife Uma Ramanna, are working together to promote the importance of plants in theirneighbourhood."

But meet Naina Siwach from Mumbai, who by her own confession, is a digital nomad. Planning, she says, is the key to making your travel dreams come true. In her 30s now, this former VP of a national PR company in Mumbai who is now 'location independent' and has chosen to become a consultant digital strategist and moved to Bali, Indonesia, in December 2017 as she feels the new job will help her travel yet work for a living. While many of us got inspired to spend at least two days at the La Tomatina Festival after watching Laila and Arjun fall in love with each other amidst the squishy tomatoes in Spain in the epic 2011 Bollywood movie Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, this girl actually managed to ring in her 30th birthday in Spain at the fest. ""Ever since I turned 21, I've managed to visit more than 30 countries and I hope to have 50 stampings in my passport before I turn 40."" she says. Naina was at The Philippines for her birthday in 2017 and she says she loves to do it the local style. Her holidays are dotted with archery, height ziplining, surfing, snorkeling, deep sea diving and more. She loves to hang out with the locals, eat like them and even rent a little studio apartment for herself when she travels. We ask her how she manages to do all of this and how to plan to explore the world. Excerpts from a conversation with this true blue nomadWhen did you start travelling solo?I ventured on my first solo travel at the rebellious age of 18, as a birthday gift to myself. I yearned to step out of my comfort zone and explore unchartered territories. The first trip was to Europe where I travelled for 30 days and it felt like the best 30 days of my life. Every day, I learnt the value of being true to myself and appreciating my moments of solitude. It changed me as a person and restored a newfound sense of independence within me. I understood how to adapt to different cultures, cuisines, languages and of course, money conversions most importantly. Every solo trip has enhanced the quality of my peace and happiness.What is it in solo travel that keeps you going again and again?Every solo trip has helped me grow and evolve as a person. It is an ideal stress buster and enables me to truly appreciate the value of my freedom and Independence and to be a better human being. It fills my soul with tranquillity. It is what I do to recover from life's many unpredictable blows, so I may refresh and rejuvenate myself and go back to face anything that comes my way with renewed energy. In a land where you meet new people, you realise you a mere speck in this vast diverse world. Taking yearly solo trips has been essential in teaching me to expand my boundaries and help me take a step back in my own life to appreciate the things I have been blessed with.How does one realise their dream of travelling the world while still holding a fulltime (often demanding) job?First earn well and save well ( a few lakhs in Indian Rupee to take care of emergencies). Then choose a job which allows you to work remotely. With the advent of mobile technology and superfast broadband and many companies also giving the remote work options, it is easier to find jobs in the new age economy. For instance, I was previously based in Mumbai and used to work fulltime as the Vice President of the luxury segment of a PR company. But now, thanks to my quest for travel, I travel wherever I want but to using my high end laptop and a super fast internet connection (luckily Bali has a good one), I work as a digital strategist for global brands. My work involves planning digital campaigns and promotions. So if your travel quest gets the better of you, this is the best way to go about life and your dreams.What are the three tips for Indian solo travellers to stay safe?During one of my solo trips to Amsterdam a few years ago, I recall feeling completely vulnerable and alone. Nonetheless, I decided to step outside my hostel and check out their famous Dutch apple pie cafe. My recommendation would be to step out of your fear zone and explore the city and trust me, this will redefine your definition of freedom. You can thank me later. The hacks that keep me safe or sorted are:- To blend in and dress like one of the locals.- Carry a dummy wallet. I keep my money and cards in my inner garments. So in case, anyone attempts to rob you, only the dummy wallet is lost.- Pepper spray is not allowed in air travel. So you can carry a mosquito spray or miniature hair spray if possible. That works too, in case of emergency to at least stump the intruder.- Pick Airbnb and hostels that have maximum reviews and are centrally located.- It is preferable to leave the DND sign on your door before leaving the hotel room.- Do not trust people easily. Stay alert and vigilant.Is there any process you follow on how you decide your next destination?Birthdays are special days and I want the best stuff those days. So for the last five years, I have made a pact to myself - to break boundaries and travel far and wide. As an avid traveller who uses almost every long weekend for some sort of travel (I started 2018 with the Thrissur Snake Boat Race festival), I have several exotic and unexplored destinations to discover. I am a thalassophile - a sea lover. The ebb and tide of the waves lull me into a new world whenever I play on the beach. So naturally, my travel is research-oriented and usually around beaches. I am an adventure freak so activities such surfing, diving and snorkelling with intriguing culture blends interest me. I celebrated my birthday in Balinese tradition in 2017.Share three travel hacks.Ans: Always make sure to inform your bank about the country you intend to visit along with the duration. Make sure you are familiar with the conversions and costs. Keep the emergency number of the bank in handy in case you lose your cards without fail.What are the destinations in your bucket list?There are three destinations and experiences I wish to complete before 2020 which are as follows:- I want to attempt the Lava Surf in Hawaii. It is said to be extremely dangerous, however, I wish to experience the thrill to ride waves on fire!- I want to walk through the magnificent Amazon rainforest. The starting point would be from Bolivia. This is an experience of a lifetime and I would recommend the same to all the solo travellers across the world.- I would like to travel across Japan for about four months during the Cherry blossom season. It begins to bloom in Okinawa, passes through the middle of Japan and finishes with a late bloom in northern Hokkaido.Ideally how much budget should a single Indian set aside for a week's travel abroad.. not too much luxury but not too much of a shoestring.. economy.It would depend on the destination. I wouldnt recommend Europe or USA for a week. The tickets are expensive and to justify that cost, you need to spend at least two to three weeks. If you want to go abroad for a week, I would recommend The Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand Islands, Cambodia and Vietnam. You can work within Rs 1.5 lakh including tickets, visa, stay, meal and intercity travel. If you are a shopaholic, then I recommend you downsize your credit limit to 50K so you dont splurge. However, avoid malls. Always visit flea markets and vintage storesWhat websites/ apps to plan your travel do you recommend?- TripIt - saves my travel itinerary, while the alerts are like my best travel buddies.- Airbnb for homestay.- Hostel World for any hostel bookings.- CityMapper - for any help in understanding local transport.- Google translate are my Go to apps as required.Any tips on snagging the best foreign travel dealsPlan in advance. Think glocal, spend on local (stuff).5 things I learnt living as digital nomad1. You get to meet the most incredible human beings on similar journeys.2. Bittersweet farewells become a happy part of your nomadic life.3. You find an abundance of love, hope, gratitude and comfort even from the most unexpected lands and cultures.4. Home is where you invest emotions in people, it is not a city or a structure that you are confined to5. Last, but not the least, you learn to care and become much more protective about our environment and our planet"

He has played host on Masterchef India and Junior Masterchef India and was invited to judge the semi-finale of Masterchef America with Chef Gordon Ramsey. He has been honoured with Dr. S Radhakrishnan National Media Network Award. The Indian Television Academy awarded him for the Best Jury/Anchor on television for Junior Masterchef India. Kapur is also the proud recipient of the prestigious Sir Edmund Hillary Fellowship 2012 from the Government of New Zealand in the field of Food & Beverage and has authored many cookbooks.Hometown: New DelhiEducation: Kapur studied at St Francis De Sales School in New Delhi and is an alumnus of Institute of Hotel Management (IHM), Sector 42, Chandigarh.My Chandigarh connect: I studied hotel management in the city and was a student here from 1997 to 2000 when I graduated. Over the last few years, my work has brought me to the city often.My area of expertise: Having worked with some of the leading hotel chains like the Taj Group of Hotels and The Leela group, I specialise in Indian cuisines and, in recent years, in food research. I am also a passionate photographer and gardener.My secret to success: There are many things that make a person successful and there are a lot of people involved in ones journey. It starts as early as school and college with our teachers. So has been the case with me, but when I look back I think my travels in India and around the world have really been key to my success as a chef. Travel helped me embrace not just all kinds of food but also different people and cultures.The turning point: For me, the turning point came when I actually started loving what I do. Let me explain why I say this. Initially, my life was very hectic. I would work long hours and weekends. At that point, I started comparing myself with people who would have weekends off or had more time on their hands. Then one day I accepted that this was how it was going to be. The day I accepted it, things changed. I started to enjoy what I do.What I owe to Chandigarh: My stay in Chandigarh was my first time away from home. My parents were initially very apprehensive. But when I came here, I didnt feel out of place. I saw how people bonded with each other. Every festival  be it Lohri, Diwali, Holi  it would be a community affair. I imbibed this community spirit. Chandigarh helped me hone my tastebuds, especially when it came to kebabs and curries. As young students we survived on humble meals that cost as little as Rs 10 and this included unlimited rotis. It taught me humility. I also learnt to appreciate the simplicity of meals and the essence of Punjabi khaana (food) here.Things I like to do when I visit Chandigarh: I always look forward to eating out when I am here. As students, our favourite haunt was the Sector 34 market. I remember a small little takeaway joint here called Chaplin. I love visiting the place when I am in Chandigarh. It brings back memories of college days. We relished all meals here including the speciality - tomato paneer. The owner knew we lived on a budget and would always give a little extra portion, including complimentary salad. I have been hooked to the place ever since my first year of college.How has the city changed over the years: I think not just cities but people change as well. Its progression. I think over the years, I have become better and my Institute has become better too. But I must say I hate how the roundabouts now have traffic signals. I still love Sukhna Lake even though it is overcrowded. I think the city has evolved but maintained an old world charm.The change I would want to see in the city: I come from Delhi and over there I see a disconnect between people and those who run it. I want the residents of Chandigarh and the people who manage it to have a better bonding. I feel it is important for a city to move forward together. I would like Chandigarh to maintain its identity and be a better city not just with regard to infrastructure but in arts as well. I remember reading how Le Corbusier emphasised art and I think efforts should be made to keep it alive.The secret of success in the hospitality industry: I always tell people who are keen about a career in hospitality or are pursuing hotel management to laugh out loud and sometimes laugh at yourself. It is a very stressful environment to work in. Its equally important to put your head down and learn. Youngsters shouldnt worry about the money. It is more important to get the skill right, the money will follow."

She used to make amazing fish pies and I was inspired by that, says Divya, who has followed her mothers footsteps, when it comes making delicious savoury pies. My family prefers my savoury bakes over my sweet ones. Especially the pork and mushroom pie, she says. She grew up in Coonoor, amid tea estates and cottage houses in the Nilgiri hills. She dreams of opening a cottage style caf, outside Chennai, as a reminiscent of her childhood. My childhood was about roaming around in our tea estate, having a beautiful view of the cottages in Coonoor and eating in small time cafes.

He had already spent Rs 50,000 in preparing his two acre field and now it was becoming difficult to recover the input cost.Balchandra Bhagat, a resident of Dobi said every year his family earned from cultivating tomatoes, but this year it had been a total loss.Rakesh said Sehore had made a name for itself in tomato cultivation and its produce was exported up to Delhi in North and down south to Hyderabad and last year the farmers of this area had earned up to Rs 1.25 lakh per acre by selling tomatoes on an average as a result of which a large number of farmers decided to plant it this season too.Commissioner and director horticulture Satyanand said tomatoes were multiple harvest crop and most of the farmers had sold a portion of their produce when prices were high.This is the fag end of the season and there is the final burst of production for which prices must have crashed, the commissioner said saying that he personally had not heard of farmers throwing tomatoes on the road."

(Express photo by Prashant Nadkar/Representational) Exactly a year ago, farmers across the state had gone on a similar strike that had crippled essential supplies. (Express photo by Prashant Nadkar/Representational)Farmers in Maharashtra are gearing up for a fresh round of protests, with a number of groups giving a call for strike in June. Exactly a year ago, farmers across the state had gone on a similar strike that had crippled essential supplies. Vegetables and fruits were stopped from reaching the urban centres while dairies complained of dip in collection as farmers refused to supply milk.After several rounds of discussions with the protesting farmers, the state government had finally agreed to some of their demands, following which the strike was called off. One of the immediate impacts of last years strike was the announcement of Rs 34,000-crore loan waiver in the form of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Samman Yojana. The procurement price of milk was increased to Rs 27 per litre, while, in response to the demand for implementation of the M S Swaminathan Commission report that had recommended that farmers receive at least 1.5 times their production costs, a special commission was announced to ensure that farmers get decent returns for their produce.ALSO READ | Farmer suicides in BJP-ruled states very low, mostly over personal issues: Amit Shah in KarnatakaBut within a year, farmers are ready to start an agitation once again. A group claiming to have the support of more than 30 organisations has called for a farmers strike from June 1. Here are some of the issues that have led to the farmers agitation.Loan waiverThe loan waiver announced by the state government was supposed to wipe off outstanding loans of farmers since 2009. This was the second loan waiver in the state, the previous one having been implemented by the Congress-NCP government in 2007-08. The scheme has been facing teething problems right from the start, mainly on account of over-reliance on technology.To submit their claims for loan waiver, farmers had been asked to fill up online forms, which was to be authenticated by cooperative department using similar data entered by the banks. Technical glitches, and the dependence of many farmers on local officials to fill up these forms, have led to delays in the process. The government had announced that loans worth Rs 23102.19 crore in 46.34 lakh farm loan accounts would be waived. Till March 6 this year, banks have been able to complete this process only for 35.68 lakh accounts, worth a total of Rs 13,782 crore.The delays in completion of loan waiver scheme has impacted disbursement of fresh farm loans for the current season. A number of ineligible farmers had defaulted on their loans, hoping their loans would also be waived off. Because of their defaults, they are finding it difficult to obtain fresh loans.There has been an almost 40 per cent drop in crop loan disbursement for this season, and a 28 per cent rise in lending by money lenders. What is likely to further delay the loan waiver scheme is the state governments acceptance of the demand of tribal farmers who had marched to Mumbai last month to extend the cut-off date of loans to 2001.PricesThe biggest worry of the farmers right now is the low prices their produce is fetching in the market. Barring soyabean, whose season is long over, not a single commodity is trading at government-specified Minimum Support Price (MSP). In the case of perishables like fruits and vegetables, the situation is worse. Rabi tomato, which sells at the rate of Rs 10 a kg, is now trading at Rs 1-2 per kg at the markets of Narayangaon and Junnar. Onions, which till recently were fetching Rs 20 a kg at wholesale markets, are now priced at Rs 6 a kg. Farmer leader and Swabhimani Paksha MP Raju Shetti says the present price slump is the worst he has seen in the last 20 years.ALSO READ | MSP Satyagrah: No mandi where farmers can sell their produce at MSP, says Yogendra YadavThe reasons for low prices are several. In case of important rabi crop like chana, the held over stock of the last two years, and a lack of market confidence, has brought about the slide. A crop like tur, which has reported lower sowing than last year, is also trading over Rs 1,200 per quintal below its MSP as the state tries to deal with the held-over stock. In fact, it is estimated that that farmers in the state have lost over Rs 1,067 crore by selling tur below MSP this season.Government procurement, often the panacea for low prices, has not helped much.Milk and sugarcaneLast year, the government had increased the procurement price of milk from Rs 24 to Rs 27 per litre. Dairies are, however, barely able to pay Rs 20 per litre to farmers owing to a glut of milk powder in the market. Sugar prices are on a steady fall which has made mills default in their payment. There are over Rs 2,200 crore in dues by the mills to cane farmers.The result has been that farmers are staring at another debt trap. With no immediate relief expected from the market, and government interventions inadequate, the farmers find themselves with no option but to start a fresh agitation. Their demands are no different from the last time  assured returns on their produce and a full loan waiver. So close to an election year, they hope to force the government to listen to their demands.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

The lines Its a tragedy of national importance that cannot be allowed to be forgotten jump at you from one wall as a girl asks her mother, How could they shoot without warning?Next-door, Sukumar Mukherjee, bright in a yellow T-shirt, sits under the impassive gaze of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. A neat row of photos, mostly black and white, line the four walls. For Mukherjee, secretary of the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust, this is both home and office  his residence is a short flight upstairs.MAKING OF A MEMORIAL The Jallianwala Bagh was owned by Himmat Singh, a noble in the court of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, who hailed from Jalla village near Fatehgarh Sahib.Area: 6.5 acre (26,000 m2)Resolution for buying the Jallianwala Bagh: 1919Funds collected: Rs 5,60,472Bagh acquired on: 1 August 1920Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust set up: 1 May 1951Flame of liberty cost: Rs 9.25 lakhDesigned by: American Benjamin PolkMemorial inaugurated on: 13 April 1961, by President Dr Rajendra Prasad in the presence of PM Jawaharlal Nehru.Members of the memorial trust: PM is the chairman, and permanent members include the Congress president, Punjab CM, governor, Union culture minister and leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha.Also Read | Part 2: Revisiting Jallianwala 100 years on: The horrible General DyerThe Bangla connectionThe 64-year-old with green eyes was born here, like his father Uttam Charan. The Mukherjees from the Hooghly district of West Bengal have been the caretakers of the Jallianwala memorial from its birth. Sukumars grandfather Sashti Charan Mukherjee, a homeopath practising in Allahabad, was deputed by Congress leader Madan Mohan Malviya to arrange a session in Amritsar in 1910. He never went back. Present at the bagh on the day of the 1919 massacre, Sashti Charan escaped death by hiding under the dais, and later moved a resolution for acquiring the bagh at the Congress session in Amritsar. This was followed by a nationwide appeal for fundraising by Mahatma Gandhi and a trust was set up with Malviya as president and Sashti Charan as secretary. The British, it is said, wanted to obliterate the signs of the massacre by setting up a cloth market here but the Indians managed to acquire the land in 1920. Miffed, the authorities arrested Sashti Charan, who had the land deed, but he remained resolute.IN DISREPAIR The concrete staircase is slowly cracking open. Even the adjacent building, acquired in 2011 as it carried the bullet marks, is beginning to crumble. God forbid there is even minor quake, the entire structure will come crashing down, says a local.A few years ago, an expert committee estimated that the repairs will take around Rs 22 lakh. The sum was sanctioned by former PM Manmohan Singh, but it is yet to reach the trust. Namita Jaspal, a heritage conservator, who has been visiting the bagh frequently, says it needs a lot of work. The buildings are made of Nankshahi bricks, they must be strengthened without disturbing their original character. The gallery too needs an upgrade, its important to showcase original documents and photos in a way that they dont disintegrate.In the past, the trust enjoyed direct access to the Prime Minister, but now all requests are routed through the ministry of culture.The trust is running its salary account on the rent from a Punjab National Bank office, a part of the property, but there are little funds for maintenance, leave alone conservation. The light-and-sound show, for instance, is lying unused for want of repair. Outside the bagh, former Hall Bazaar councillor Sunil Sharma Konti, claims the memorial is facing neglect because of the perception that it is associated with the Congress.Well wishers feel a nominal entry fees of even Rs 1 can make the bagh self-sustainable as it receives around 50,000 visitors a day. This proposal was strongly supported by BJP doyen LK Advani, but nothing came out of it.Ever since, the Mukherjees have been the caretakers of the memorial. Sukumar, the youngest of three brothers, quit his bank job to take up the mantle from his father Upendra Narayan when he died in 1988. I was appointed by then PM Rajiv Gandhi, says Sukumar. The bagh has seen a lot of development, he says, but people no longer accord it the respect it deserves. Most visitors treat it as a picnic spot, sometimes they dont even care to read its history, sighs Sukumar, who has seen a long march of VVIPs at the tall pink obelisk, called the flame of liberty.Also Read | Part 1: Bloodbath on Baisakhi, the massacre that shook the British RajA memorable journeyThough the trust is headed by the prime minister himself, managing the memorial is no cakewalk. In 2011, Sukumar had goons following him when the Punjab and Haryana high court ordered an illegal occupant of a neighbouring building acquired by the trust to vacate it. Sukumar laughs as he recounts how the cops ran away and left him to fend for himself in the middle of the eviction process.A few years ago, when the Indian Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) decided to set up a control room for a light-and-sound show on the massacre, someone spread a rumour that they were planning a mujra. Members of the Bhagat Singh Naujawan Sabha got together and damaged the stage and speakers. It took us one year to get the project back on track. During militancy, a group of youngsters with swords threatened to kill his father, saying they had seen people smoking in the bagh. Papaji was very gutsy, he said, kill me and they left.Former President Dr Rajendra Prasad, ex-PM Jawaharlal Nehru, then CM of Punjab Partap Singh Kairon at the inauguration of the Jallianwala Bagh Memorial Trust on April 13, 1961. (HT photo)Complaints, howsoever frivolous, are commonplace. Last fortnight, the Punjab State Human Rights Commission shot off a notice to the trust, asking it to explain why the Sulabh Shauchalya on the premises was charging Rs 2 from women. Someone must have complained to them; but this is a charge imposed by the company, how do I explain it, Mukherjee wonders.A life less ordinaryLiving with a piece of history has its challenges. Kakali, Sukumars bubbly wife who came here as a young bride in the 1980s when militancy had gripped the state, remembers the siege during Op Bluestar. We couldnt step out for over a week, thankfully papaji (Upendra Narayan) had a habit of storing ration. It was due to the barter of onions and tomatoes that she came close to her neighbours during that period.The galiara project for the beautification of the space around the Golden Temple has compounded the number of visitors to the bagh. We have a free 24-hour light and sound show, says Kakali. With the Golden Temple on one side and a small mosque on the other, they are treated to both gurbani and the call of the muezzin. I enjoy the kirtan, it very soothing, says Kakoli, who has learnt to speak and read Punjabi.Lack of privacy is the first casualty of living here but the couple dont mention it. What Kakali does broach is lack of normal domestic life. Weve never had a weekend, those are reserved for VIP visits, she laughs as Sukumar tells you how hes never celebrated the birthday of his elder daughter Proshita as it coincides with the hanging of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.Sukumars two brothers have moved back to Kolkata, his three sisters too have married and left. After the couples two daughters Proshita, a banker, and Shreya, a designer, moved out due to jobs, Kakali has been dividing her time between Kolkota and Amritsar. Often, Sukumar is left alone with his 90-year-old ailing mother, who introduced Durga Puja to the holy city.My daughters worry about my health and tell me Papa, youve done enough sewa, come stay with us, but I want to see the memorial through its 100th anniversary. Then, I will see, sighs Sukumar.His eyes liquid, Sukumar is clear: I cant turn my back on this place. Its seeped by the blood of so many. I cant let them down.Read Part 4 here"

He says he will harvest the last crop tomatoes planted over an acrein April and then quit farming. Year after year, we are struggling against falling market prices, vagaries of climate, an apathetic government and indebtedness. Farming is all that I know but it is no longer viable. I will put up a shop, sell tea or lease out my land, but I wont farm anymore, said Khandbahale, who owns three acres of land.In June last year, Khandbahale was one of the thousands of farmers in Maharashtra who took to the streets to protest against the agrarian crisis the state is battling. One of the central demands of the protesters was a complete loan waiver.As supply of vegetables and milk to the cities stopped, the two-day strike forced chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to announce a farm loan waiver worth Rs 34,000 crore, a demand he had resisted since 2014.Less than a year after the strike and the waiver  up to Rs 1.50 lakh per family  farmers remain unimpressed. In Nasik and Ahmednagar districts, which bore the brunt of the protests, farmers say the waiver hasnt helped ease their struggle.Bowing to pressure The Maharashtra govt announced a loan waiver last June. Farmers say it hasnt helped ease their struggle so far Rs 34,000 cr farm loan waiver was announced by the state government after protests by farmers in June 2017 Rs 1.5 lakh per family cap has been put on the loan waiver. This includes principal and interest amount, crop loans as well as mid-term loans from 2009 to June 2016 The scheme had three components  besides the Rs 1.5 lakh waiver, it offered a one-time settlement option for those whose loans were farm loan waiver was announced by the state government after protests by farmers in June 2017per family cap has been put on the loan waiver. This includes principal and interest amount, crop loans as well as mid-term loans from 2009 to June 2016had three components  besides the Rs 1.5 lakh waiver, it offered a one-time settlement option for those whose loans were The loan waiver was disbursed through an online system after seeking applications by farmers, and syncing their data with that of the banks, using Aadhar unique identity numbers as a primary parameter The system was hit by technical glitches and after it came to light that a majority of nationalised and cooperative banks had not seeded the data with Aadhaar accounts more than Rs 1.5 lakh and a cash incentive of Rs 25,000 for those who repaid loans on timewaiver was disbursed through an online system after seeking applications by farmers, and syncing their data with that of the banks, using Aadhar unique identity numbers as a primary parameterwas hit by technical glitches and after it came to light that a majority of nationalised and cooperative banks had not seeded the data with Aadhaar accounts So far, the government has disbursed Rs 13,580 crore to 3.532 million farmers accounts; 7.7 million farmers applied for the loan waiver and around 4.652 million were found eligible for the various components. Out of these, 3.038 million have applied for a full waiver and remaining for the incentive cash amount. Another Rs 10,000 crore has been budgeted for the waiver.Khandbahale owes Rs 8.5 lakh to a bank in Nasik. He can benefit from the Rs 1.5 lakh waiver only after he pays the remaining amount he owes. I dont have Rs 7 lakh in hand, why would I keep incurring more debt if I had the money? I may have to sell off some of my land to make that last payment to the bank. We dont need waivers. We can repay our loans if we get assured prices for our produce, he said.In Putamba village of Ahmednagar district, ground zero of the last years strike, farmers remain disaffected.The loan waiver helps banks more than us. So, the government should stop pretending they have done something big for farmers. If they want to help, then they should increase minimum support prices (MSP), procure the produce from us, said Salim Shaikh, an onion farmer from the village, who may not be able to take advantage of the waiver. This year, his income from soyabean and onion has been minimal. He owes a nationalised bank Rs 3.5 lakh he borrowed as a mid-term loan and Rs 2 lakh as a crop loanThe governments list of beneficiaries shows Maharashtra has 1 million farmers like Khandbahale and Shaikh who owe more than Rs 1.50 lakh to banks. Such farmers have been offered a one-time settlement (OTS)pay off the remaining amount to the bank and get a Rs 1.50 lakh waiver. Not many farmers are in a position to take up this offer.Shaikhs neighbour Rajendra Dhakchaule, a marginal farmer with just two acres of cultivable land, can repay most of his Rs 1.70 lakh debt with the waiver. But his worries dont end with this.I had taken a loan of Rs 3.5 lakh for a tractor and under pressure collected money from a money lender to pay off this loan. I may get some respite due to the loan waiver but thats fleeting help. The ground situation for farmers like me is unsustainable, he says, breaking down.This year, the Dhakchaules spent Rs 56,000 to cultivate onion over an acre of land, but the family of six may not recover even the cultivation costs as onion prices have dropped to Rs 700 per quintal from Rs 3000 per quintal this January. This is an eight-month low for onions.In neighbouring Pimpalgaon village, Vijay Waghchowre, a marginal farmer who owns four acres of land, is still waiting for confirmation of the waiver from his bank.The waiver may help us marginally this year. But I still owe another Rs 2 lakh to a moneylender. If the government wants to help farmers, let it give us subsidies or offer assured prices for our produce.The BJP-led state government is counting on the goodwill of marginal farmers like Dhakchaule to help it tide over the rural discontent.The directives of the chief minister were to ensure a system whereby the loan waiver would be transparent, inclusive and swift. We were careful to learn from the mistakes of the past loan waiver, said Kaustubh Dhavse, officer on special duty at the chief ministers office, who was involved in devising the online system for the loan waiver. There had been connivance at the level of banks, government and farmers earlier to give benefits to ineligible farmers. In our case, there is no room for such connivance because the online system does not allow for it. The waiver has offered benefit to maximum genuine farmers.Goodwill for the government isnt visible on the ground.A section of farmers leaders is continuing protests for a complete loan waiver. This month, as nearly 30,000 largely tribal cultivators marched from Nasik to Mumbai, the leaders put the demand back on their agenda. This was despite a majority of the protestors demanding their rights over forest lands and not a waiver as they have no access to banks.As a temporary relief to farmers to overcome the current distress, a complete loan waiver is essential. Thats why we continue to flag it whenever possible. A hike in MSP is one of our main demands and the state has failed to deliver on that too, said Ajit Navale, general secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha, involved in both the farmers protests.The loan waiver has a limited scope. Consider this, the total crop loan debt on the states farmers is Rs 1.13 lakh crore; the government so far has spent only Rs 13,580 crore on the loan waiver, he said."
5aeaa2649855b73f522c17c8,Farmers dump tomatoes as prices slide,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/farmers-dump-tomatoes-as-prices-slide-5123881/,2018-04-05,,Indian Express,"AS tomato prices dropped to Rs 400 a quintal towards the end of March, Sanjay Bochate, 37, a farmer with a tiny land-holding of an acre, hacked down his tomato vines and brinjal plants in Bori village of Mehkar taluka, Buldhana. Whatever could be salvaged after his emotional outburst, he placed in a heap and put up a sign: Take farm produce for free.That was barely a week after another farmer in Jalna, Premising Chavan, was videographed taking a hoe to a healthy cauliflower field. Days after the video of the apoplectic Chavan destroying his crop was shared widely on WhatsApp, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray met him in Mumbai and handed over aid offered by a private organisation. Cauliflower prices were hovering around Rs 500 a quintal. Its not possible to even cover cost of cultivation and harvest and transport at such prices, Bochate told The Indian Express over the phone. Being able to afford my two boys school fees is increasingly difficult.Instances of farmers dumping their produce on roadsides, witnessed across the country in the aftermath of demonetisation, appear to have returned to Maharashtras countryside as vegetable prices plummet. Days after nearly 40,000 tribals, other farmers and farm labourers marched from Nashik to Mumbai last month, some farmers in northern Nashik dumped tomatoes on the roadside. Prices that week dipped to Rs 200 a quintal in Nashik.Shriram Gadhave, president of the Narayangaon-based Vegetable Growers Association of India, said vegetable prices will remain depressed through the coming summer owing to increased farm area under vegetables. The rains were good, and the water table has improved, so many farmers go in for vegetables expecting good prices in the summer season, he said.Until four or five years back, the pockets around Narayangaon and Nashik used to supply a large percentage of the states tomatoes, he said. But now production is coming in from all corners of the state. Whether its Aurangabad or Beed or elsewhere, local tomatoes are now available in plenty.The promise of better access to processing industries has not borne fruit for vegetable farmers  the capacity of processing industries is barely 2 to 3 per cent of the crop, according to Gadhave. Bochate, who used to drive a Bolero that he purchased with a loan, sold the vehicle two years back to focus on farming.I used to grow soybean before. After I sold the Bolero I repaid the loan and dug a borewell on my land. There was plenty of water, so I was expecting Rs 3 lakh from my tomatoes and brinjal this season, he said. Instead, he was offered Rs 25 per 20-kg crate  that wouldnt cover even the auto ride to the market and the cost of cultivation and harvest.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

I used to bring home different plant cuttings for my garden. She finds it a natural way to relax.Jyoti started working on her present patch of green from 2014. Over these three years, she has developed ground and terrace gardens, in which she has plants that are healthy for consumption. She chooses to do organic gardening.The garden has a variety of fruits such as mulberry, papaya, coconut and mosambi. Vegetables include cauliflower, tomato, cabbage and chilies. She says that the produce is sufficient for her family, and she rarely visits the market.Jyothi also takes a keen interest in exotic plant varieties such as lotus and lilies. She makes her own compost from kitchen waste and, every two months, she gets around eight sacks of compost.She says, Adding chemicals to the soil is harmful to it. Organic gardening begins with attention to the soil. You regularly add organic matter to the soil, using locally available resources wherever possible. And everyone has access to the raw ingredients of organic matter, because your lawn, garden and kitchen produce them every day. Decaying plant wastes, such as grass clippings, fall leaves and vegetable scraps from your kitchen, are the building blocks of compost, the ideal organic matter for your garden soil. If you add compost to your soil, youre already on your way to raising a beautiful, healthy garden.Talking about organic gardening, she says, When you garden organically, you think of your plants as part of a whole system within nature that starts in the soil and includes the water supply, people, wildlife and even insects. An organic gardener strives to work in harmony with natural systems and to minimise and continually replenish any resources the garden consumes. Jyothi, who volunteers at an NGO that works for the betterment of farmers, promotes the practice of organic gardening in her neighbourhood.Jyothi says pest control is necessary. She adds, Removing disease-infected leaves or plants, rotating crops so you are not growing the same type in the same spot year after year, and handpicking insect pests and eggs all help to suppress pest populations. She uses tulsi as a natural way of preventing pests.Jyoti along with her domestic helps invests around two hours in the morning and evening to water the plants and take care of the garden."

We generally do well at home, but our away record hasn't been good. We should try to get teams from 16 to 8 (AFC rankings) ranking. It's difficult to play South Korea and Japan as they don't want to play us. We should get teams who are better than us and play at their home. This is from the organisation side,"" Chhetri told IANS in an interview here.""From the players' side, we need to improve ourselves individually, making sure that the competition for the national team increases and it is a big headache for the coach. It should be tough for him to choose the players and whenever that happens he gets the cream,"" the 33-year-old said.India qualified for the Asian Cup by beating Macau in the qualifiers last year in October.The last time India played in the world's second-oldest continental football championship was in 2011 under British coach Bob Houghton. Chhetri was an integral part of the team, scoring two goals in the group stages in what was only India's third appearance.India did not win a match and bowed out, letting in 13 goals and scoring just three.Chhetri said India should look to play teams like the United Arab Emirates (UAE), who are also hosting the Asian Cup, on the road.Indian football team captain Sunil Chhetri (EPS | Vinod Kumar)""We are at the bottom, man. Whoever we get is going to be better than us,"" Chhetri said when asked to name the teams they should play friendlies with leading up to the tournament, starting in January next year.""In 2011, we got No 1, No 3 and No 5 -- Australia, South Korea, Bahrain (in the main round). It couldn't have been worse than that mathematically. This time we got Kyrgyzstan, Macau and Myanmar (in the qualifiers). With due respect to them it wasn't very difficult.""We should aim to play the UAE, Qatar, Oman, Palestine and Lebanon (in the friendlies),"" Chhetri said.There are talks of a four-nation Champions Cup taking place this year in India. Chhetri said the tourney would have no bearing on India's rankings as it is outside the FIFA dates, but the match practice would do a world of good to India's preparations.""Now it's not about the rankings, because we have qualified. Having said that, the arrangements of the groups matter in terms of ranking but keeping all these things aside, playing at home those three-four nation tournament...I hope we get better teams to play against,"" he said.Chhetri in Bengaluru FC training colours (Twitter/Indian Super League)Coming to his club Bengaluru FC, which is at the top of the ISL standings now, Chhetri said it doesn't have the pressure of expectations and takes one game at a time.""The motto in our club is to think about the next game -- the way we won two Federation Cups and the I-League by taking one game at a time. The motto has not changed,"" he said.Just married to long-time girlfriend Sonam, daughter of former India and Mohun Bagan defender Subrata Bhattacharya, Chhetri signed off tongue-in-cheek, saying he now knows the prices of ""onions and tomatoes"".""The last 10-15 days after marriage... I have enjoyed my time. I think me and Sonam have seen each other for 13 years but we never lived with each other. She was always a tourist wherever I played. Now living together, it's nice, man. More because, apart from the fact that she is my wife and I love her... we are also very good friends,"" he said.""She understands my job. So there was no need of telling her that I have to come back and sleep and take a nap... everything is nice because she understands. Later in the evening we watch Netflix. We go for walks.

So far, 20 centres of excellence are functioning in different states under the Indo-Israeli Agriculture Project and five more will be operational by next month. Photo: Israel EmbassyNew Delhi: India and Israel are set to jointly develop new crop varieties and share post harvest technologies following the success of the 10-year-old Indo-Israeli Agriculture Project (IIAP) whose accomplishments include growing cherry tomatoes in Haryana, rejuvenating mango orchards in Maharashtra and demonstrating to Indian farmers the effectiveness of state-of-the-art irrigation technologies.For a country like Israel where 60% of the area is desert, exporting high-value farm produce like mangoes and avocados is a matter of pride, whereas for India, among the largest food producers globally, the challenge is to counter the effects of erratic rainfall, raise productivity and use water efficiently.So, it was with the objective of sharing best practices and technical knowledge from Israel that the agriculture cooperation project was launched in 2008. The implementing partners for the project are the National Horticulture Mission (NHM) under the agriculture ministry, MASHAV, Israels agency for international development cooperation, and Indian state governments which help set up centres of excellence as per their local needs.Our goal is to help the Indian farmer by exposing them to new technologies tailored to their local needs, said Dan Alluf, counsellor of science and agriculture at MASHAV, Delhi.There is a lot of focus on drip irrigation and how to design better farms by using canopy management and use of improved irrigation and fertigation technologies, Alluf said, adding, Each centre showcases a range of greenhouses to farmers depending on their needs and capabilities. A unique focus is to teach farmers the language of irrigation - when to irrigate and by how much - to increase water use efficiency.So far, 20 centres of excellence are functioning in different states and five more will be operational by next month. Notable among these are centres for vegetables in Karnal, Haryana, for mangoes in Dapoli and for citrus fruits in Nagpur, both in Maharashtra, and one for pomegranates in Bassi, Rajasthan.Among the unique projects are a functional centre of excellence for bee-keeping in Haryana and a centre for dairy which is in the pipeline.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit to Israel in July last year, a new action plan for the years 2018-2020 envisages joint development of new crop varieties and sharing of post harvest technologies.Further, the plan is to establish a partnership on water conservation that includes waste-water treatment and its reuse for agriculture, desalination, water utility reforms, and the cleaning of the Ganga and other rivers using advanced water technologies.According to a MASHAV document, vegetable intervention in Haryana showed how crop productivity could be increased 5-10 times under protected cultivation of tomato, capsicum and cucumber, coupled with 65% decrease in water use and substantial reduction in fertiliser and pesticide costs.Similarly, the mango orchard rejuvenation project in Dapoli resulted in a three-fold rise in productivity within three years.Every year, between 10,000 and 20,000 farmers visit each of these centres, and we hope the technologies we are showcasing will echo, carried forward by state governments and the private sector, said Alluf.One of the key ways to boost overall agricultural production is to implement better soil-water management techniques that would provide the arid and semi-arid lands better access to irrigation water, without actually increasing the stress on available water resources, said a NITI Aayog concept paper released in October last year.However, data from the report showed that out of 160 million hectares of cultivable land in India, only about 65 million hectares or 41% is covered under irrigation. Also, just 8.6 million hectares are currently covered under micro-irrigation compared to a potential 69.5 million hectares.In states which are water-stressed such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Gujarat, adoption of drip irrigation has been faster but so far, adoption of these technologies among north Indian farmers has been lower due to easy water availability, said Siraj Hussain, former agriculture secretary and currently a fellow at the Delhi-based Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.The centre and state governments also need to push these technologies with more funding. Last years budget announced a Rs5,000 crore micro-irrigation fund, but it took almost a year to operationalise it, Hussain added."

Onion prices have recorded a correction at a time when the central government has announced a special initiative for the crop along with tomato and potato.Onion prices have dipped again in the wholesale markets with the bulb trading below Rs 1,000 per quintal. A bumper crop in Maharashtra as well as early arrival of rabi onions in the wholesale markets of states like Gujarat and Rajasthan led to a steep price correction which traders say is likely to remain for the rest of the season. On Wednesday, the average price of onions at Lasalagon wholesale market in Nashik was Rs 788 per quintal  one third of the price it fetched in January. Onion prices have been showing a downward trend since the beginning of March. In most wholesale markets, average traded price was below Rs 1,000 per quintal.This is in sharp contrast to the price trend a few weeks back when prices were hovering between Rs 1,500-2,000 per quintal. Prices had crossed the Rs 3,000 mark in November, December and January which spiked the prices in the retail markets as well. The eight-month bull run, farmers had said, had come after almost a 15 month slump which saw farmers selling onions at throw away prices of Rs 300-5,00 quintals. The price slump is due a bumper summer or rabi crop which has started arriving in the markets. Maharashtra has reported around 3.5 lakh hectares under summer onion this year as against the 3 lakh hectares last year. Also onion crop area has increased in neighbouring states of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. Maharashtra accounts for almost 60 per cent of the summer crop.Farmers normally store their produce in moisture and heat proof structures called Kanda chawl to dispose them of later in the season. Rabi onions normally feed the market from March till the arrival of the new kharif crop later in September.Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of Lasalgaons wholesale market, said that the bumper arrivals have brought down prices. Arrival is huge and thus prices have come down. We fear prices might go down further in view of the good crop expected, he said.Onion prices have recorded a correction at a time when the central government has announced a special initiative for the crop along with tomato and potato. Under Operation Green, the government wishes to re-construct the success in the dairy sector under Operation Flood. However, as prices come down, traders say exports have also taken a hit despite nil minimum export price (MEP). There is no demand from the outside markets, said Jagdish Apshunde, an exporter at Nashiks wholesale market. Till November last year, the country had recorded 17,72, 254.31 quintals of onion export.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Chef Sanjeev Kapoor believes that we are already setting trends.As an example he points out at haldiwala doodh or rather the new term as we know Turmeric Latte was one of the largest international food trends in 2016-17. Talking about ghee, he says, The world is just discovering what a fabulous, nutritious and flavourful cooking ingredient it is.What foods to try in 2018There are other interesting food trends that makes 2018 a year to look forward, predicts the city-based food pundits. Pickling and Fermentation is one of the unique trends this year, says Zorawar Kalra, founder & managing director, Massive Restaurants. Kalra says, It is perfect for the health conscious people as it not only boosts the intake of fruits and vegetables, it is also filled with vitamins and enzymes that are created during the fermentation process.Chef Sanjeev KapoorRuban Das, general manager of DoubleTree Suites by Hilton points out two important food trends that will dominate 2018. The first trend he talks about is celebrating unknown street food. He adds Street foods such as bunny chow (South Africa), banh mi (Vietnam), mohinga (Burma), tamales (Mexico), durum (Turkey), chhana poda (India  Odisha) will make its way this year.Opening of restaurants that serves north east cuisine can be a trend. He believes that the taste of North East is still not widely known. Das says The cuisine from north eastern states are surprisingly different from one another. While Sikkim and Arunachal have Tibetan and Nepalese influence; Meghalay, Tripura and Assam have some characteristics of food from East Bengal. Manipuri food has good vegetarian options, he says.Mediterranean food is hot now, believes Vinesh Gupta, general manager, The Den Bengaluru. He says, The Mediterranean-inspired dishes are packed with flavour  especially smoky, spicy notes made with fresh, clean, better-for-your ingredients. They dont require meat to take a starring role, which is perfect for the growing number of consumers opting for vegetarian meals.Interaction between the chef and customer is also a trend that is fast catching up. Chef Vikas Seth, Culinary Director at Embassy Leisure, Sanchez & Sriracha says, Several dishes are now made live at tables and the concept of chefs table is also becoming very popular.He also points to the proliferation of new cuisines from across the world due to interest of well-travelled customers.Technology is prerequisite, even in food industry. Chef Sanjeev Kapoor predicts, We will see several new food ventures in the digital space in terms of social media, gadgets, apps and more.Beer and CocktailsLets get old-fashionedCocktails with fancy names at a bar will take a back seat this year. Hemant Mundkur, brand ambassador of Diageo India, believes that there is going to be a rise in cocktails preparations at home, hosting friends the old fashioned way. He also predicts that Scotch whisky will find its way into cocktails this year.Abhishek Bindal, AVP, operations, KA Hospitality, talks about a very interesting liquid trend  Barrel aged cocktails. He explains This trend involves putting pre-mixed drinks into barrels for a few weeks in order to enhance the flavour, texture and complexity of the cocktail following the same ideology behind whiskey, wine and other traditional spirits.He adds that most people in Bengaluru prefer their Gin & Tonic. This pattern will continue but people will look at more evolved G&T cocktails and will be open to experimenting more with the flavours and types of gin.Sour beer in your mugChef Yogen DattaJohn Eapen, a city-based brewery consultant talks about the big beer trends that will rule the roost in the city this year. He says, Bengaluru has a mature craft beer audience. People travelling abroad are trying a broad spectrum of craft beer styles. Bitter styles such as Pale Ales and IPAs (India Pale Ales) are slowly gaining momentum and catching up with Wheat Beers. Expect more Sour Beers in 2018.He adds consumers have started appreciating craft beer helping drive consumption. Outlets in city do anywhere from 10,000-20,000 liters every month. Bengalurus craft beer standards (batch quality/consistency) are also some of the highest in the country, he says.Matcha Fever to continueA meal is never complete without a dessert. Chef Yogen bats for pairing of unusual flavours in desserts. He says Green apple and cucumber with single origin chocolate to create a light chocolate dessert is a fine example of the food pairing in desserts. Juxtaposing ingredients which are seemingly not alike, is helping chefs create new sensations.The Matcha fever took over India last year and many restaurants have now come up with their own versions. Talking about this popular trend, Chef Yogen says This flavour is unique and is a departure from the sweet, floral and fruity flavours, desserts are usually associated with. However, Abhishek credits the health benefits of Matcha for its rising popularity. He says, With 10 times the antioxidants of regular green tea, Matcha graduated from simply being used as just a tea to being sold in health-food stores as a superfood ingredient for use in baking and desserts.Chef Abhijit Saha, Founder, Director and Chef  Avant Garde Hospitality concludes with a very unusual dessert trend for 2018. He predicts This year will see a surge in introduction of salts in desserts. A lot of usage of spices and herbs in desserts will be seen, along with unusual items such as tomatoes, olives and olive oil."

The years are breathing down the neck of Kidambi Srikanth. Saina Nehwal voiced her intent to try becoming the first Indian woman to win the prestigious crown while PV Sindhu has looked the likeliest to win it for some time. The years are breathing down the neck of Kidambi Srikanth.Indian badminton has been a scroll of happy headlines for the last 10 years since Saina Nehwal scored her first upset win at the Beijing Olympics. Success at the Super Series, the World Championships and the Olympics has added layers to its history, as a flurry of names have cornered fame and remain in fine fettle to stake claim on any title. Yet, the best of the countrys shuttlers keep returning to the All England to reconnect with badmintons original moment of glory: the All England. In the coming week  and in years to come, indeed  Indias global stars are bound to race each other to the one title their coach Pullela Gopichand has, and they dont: the All England.Saina Nehwal began 2018 voicing her intent to try becoming the first Indian woman to win the prestigious crown. For some time now, PV Sindhu has looked the most likeliest to get herself into contention. The years are breathing down the neck of Indias biggest hope K Srikanth  its been 17 Marches now, since Gopichand last won. That had taken 20 years of waiting after Prakash Padukones big moment for Indian mens singles which turns 38 this spring. Both HS Prannoy and B Sai Praneeth will be acutely aware that this Super 1000 event  a $10,00,000 event  can catapult them ahead of every other shuttler in the countrys imagination. China and Indonesia Super 1000s  second tier after World Championship  bring in the same money, but All England is what sets hearts aflutter.Gopichand would be the first to know the enormity of the event. And hence, he will be the last person to remind his charges of the larger significance  and in turn pile on the pressure. Indians will head into Birmingham on Wednesday the same way they do at any other meet  looking at mid-week as the first of a hopeful five matches to come. The toughest throw of the dice has gone Saina Nehwals way. Yet, who else but the trailblazer, to embrace that stiff challenge.The rivalryNehwal starts against Chinese Taipeis Tai Tzu Ying. This is a saga worthy of a chapter of its own. The World No 1 vs Indias original superstar. The numbers have insidiously turned against Nehwal in the last 8 years  the Indian won the first 4 of their faceoffs, lost the next two before stamping down the talented opponent for a title at the Swiss Open in 2013, and then lost 7 in a row. Its not this notoreity of piled up losses though that makes this contest interesting. Saina (world No 11) vs Tai Tzu (world No 1) is anything but run-of-the-mill: it is in fact an opportunity for the Indian to hog headlines on Day 1. The surface of the courts at the Birmingham Arena is said to be harder than usual, and decisive footwork on this carpet that draws added effort out of the legs, remains key to beating Tai Tzu.Nehwal has worked specifically with coach Gopichand on quickening her movements against an opponent who is toughest to pre-empt with her variety in strokes. Just about the only solution is to be quick on the feet and hope that her anticipation antennae are specially alert if she wants to start chipping at the 5-9 head to head. Picking the Taiwanese girls strokes is half the job done, and Nehwal will have to back herself to not get blitzed away like happened at Indonesia two months ago. Nehwal would want to bring in her typical confidence that gets reinforced when her fitness is high and her movements precise.PV Sindhu can afford to look beyond the first round where she meets Chochuwong Pornpawee of Thailand. American Beiwen Zhang  the last woman to beat Sindhu a month ago, could be next, though she could find herself in a slugfest as early as quarters against Nozomi Okuhara. Sindhu too brought the All England in her radar vocalising her wish to win it in the run-up, and this will be the first of 2018s big events, where she would want to assert her ability to go for the titles, though Marin and Akane Yamaguchi are in the fourth seeds half of the draw to make life difficult.The draw has been wicked to the Chinese, with three clubbed into one quarter.Shuttle speeds permitting, Kidambi Srikanth ought to back himself to go deep into the tournament. He starts against Worlds giant killer Frenchman Brice Leverdez, and could be in a tricky quarter with HS Prannoy  who will need to beat higher ranked Chou Tien Chen and the plucky Indonesians. Chong Wei and Lin Dan will play out their skirmish of the ageing titans, before Srikanth gets a crack at them, but the country isnt one of the Indians happiest haunts.Three first round exits in 4 years mean Srikanth, aged 25, ranked 3, whos best performance was clearing the first round here, hasnt had the best of All Englands. But 2017 was a sensational year for Indias best mens singles player, and he cabn fancy his chances in a field that is depleted just a tad by the withdrawal of World No 1 Viktor Axelsen. Theres a slippery second round against Chinese Huang Yuxian (Srikanth lost to a first-time Chinese last year) or local hero Rajeev Ouseph. But should the stars align on five days, this could be Srikanths All England.Prannoy and Sai Praneeth are there to upset equations and trigger a ruckus in the draw  though Praneeth starts out against automaton  the defensive Son Wan Ho. The Indian is known for his impatience when botching matches, and itll be a mini-victory of sorts if he can clear the first hurdle against the Korean whose second nature is to induce ennui.Indias doubles pairings await a break-out performance, and will need to stay in contention till Friday, to corner attention amidst Indias strongest singles contingent. The doubles pairings are also battling the distraction of the new service rule that is being put into trial at All England.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

The model contract law, a copy of which has been reviewed by Hindustan Times, follows the Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2018.Conceived in the 1960s, APMC regulations require farmers to sell to licenced middlemen only in notified markets, usually in the same area as the farmer, rather than directly to buyers elsewhere.These rules were meant to protect farmers from being forced into distress selling. Over time, they have spawned layers of intermediaries, stretching the farm-to-fork supply chain. This results in a large price spread, meaning fragmentation of profit share because of the presence of too many middlemen.Usually, farmers get the lowest share of profit. APMCs have also become hubs for cartels that rig the system to offer lower prices to farmers while driving up prices for consumers. India has about 6,800 such public-sector markets.The revised Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2018, now set to be released to states, allows firms to sign advance contracts with farmers to grow a chosen crop or its specific variety with a buy-back assurance at an agreed price, giving cultivators a ready market without the oversight of the APMC system.A model law isnt presented in Parliament, but is instead sent to states for passage since the Centre cannot bring laws to regulate agriculture marketing, which falls in the states domain.To work around APMC markets, the budget for fiscal 2019 has also proposed to develop 22,000 new or existing private rural markets.The revised provisions of the model contract law state that businesses and farmers can enter into contracts for any crop, livestock breed or poultry of their choice. The earlier version, released for public scrutiny on January 23, restricted contract farming to only those crops that are allowed by states.The model law provides for dispute settlement at the level of the tehsil, or local administrative unit. It does away with an earlier provision that disputes could be taken for appeal to a decree court. Instead, the parties can escalate it to a three-member local authority, comprising an independent farmer, a corporate representative and a domain expert, all unrelated to the contracting parties. The law seeks to protect the farmers lands and their title. No business can build permanent structures on a farmers land or seize land. Registrations of contracts will be completely online, the model law says. The earlier version provided for physical contracts.Technological advancement with better agricultural practices makes contract farmers more technically and economically efficient, according to a 2016 post-doctoral study on contract farming in Punjab by Nivedita Sharma of the New Delhi-based Jawaharlal Nehru University.In most cases of contract farming, the sponsor, or the contracting firm, also directly provides most inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, as well as credit and technical skills to the farmers with whom it enters into a deal. This lowers the market risk for farmers.Several states did reform markets and gave direct marketing licences to various kinds of corporate buyers like Tata, Mahindra and Godrej, said R Ravikanth, an analyst with commodity trading firm Comtrade.We dont support contract farming because it is another form of exploitation. Why isnt there a provision that all produce will be contracted above minimum support prices? said Pema Ram, a leader of the All India Kisan Sabha.Most of these licences are not in use, Ravikanth added, because it is difficult to coordinate with a large number of small farmers. Current examples of contract farming include PepsiCo Inc. for tomato in Punjab, SABMiller Plc. for barley and McCain Foods Ltd for potato in Gujarat."

With the aim of alleviating farmer distress, the Centre included in the Union Budget an increase in the minimum support price for monsoon crops and pledged Rs 500 crore to Operation Greens, a programme to help farmers growing tomatoes, onions, and potatoes. Such measures will benefit farmers who own land, not those who dont.Data shows that 71% of Scheduled Caste farmers are what the census refers to as agricultural labourers  they work for wages on land they do not own. That figure is much lower among other groups: 47% for Scheduled Tribe farmers and 41% for non-SC/ST farmers. Data from the 70th round of Land and Livestock Holdings Survey of the NSSO indicates that 58.4% of rural Dalit households are landless -- a much higher proportion than households in any other social group. Landlessness is particularly severe among Dalits in states with a history of feudalism such as Haryana, Punjab and Bihar, where more than 85% of Dalit households do not own any land other than the plot they live on. More than 60% of Dalit households are landless in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Kerala, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and Odisha. The Socio Economic and Caste Census points out that landlessness and dependence on manual casual labour for a livelihood are key deprivations facing rural families, making them far more vulnerable to impoverishment.Apart from sporadic efforts, most notably in the Gandhian Bhoodan movement pioneered by Vinoba Bhave in Telangana in the 1950s and by Left governments in West Bengal and Kerala, and to some extent the National Conference government in Jammu and Kashmir, radical measures such as land distribution have not been taken.Of late, a newer generation of politicians has again voiced the demand for giving five acres of land to landless Dalit households as a means to resolve the crisis of rural livelihoods. It is not in agricultural alone that the Dalits have been short-changed. They are under-represented when it comes to jobs in the private sector and education. The States role in fighting this inequality is crucial. But with land holdings becoming even more fragmented  86% of the holdings in India are small and marginal, less than two hectares  it remains to be seen whether populist sops such as loan waivers, employment guarantee schemes and food security initiatives bring relief to small, marginalised farmers fighting landlessness, discrimination and poverty."

An Australian delegation visited the governments centre of excellence at Bassi in Jaipur district recently to study the prospects of introducing the technique in the state.Soon, the Australian government will send a formal proposal for sharing this technique with Rajasthan, after which the work will start, said Prabu Lal Saini, the state agriculture minister.Hydroponics is a method to grow plants without soil, using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent.The three-member delegation, including South Australian governments investment manager (Indian trade) Rahul Ranjan and Australian firm Ironwoods chief consultant Mark Cody, studied the site and infrastructure at the centre for two days beginning January 11.Saini said that hydroponics technique would be used in the farming of tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, cucumber (kheera) and coloured capsicum. The farming of these vegetables will be done in 4,000 square metre area in Bassi. Use of the technique would increase the yields manyfolds, he said.Generally, yield per plant of tomato in three months is around half a kg and when grown in poly house the yield increases to 5-6kg per plant in six months, but through the hydroponics technique, the yield per plant will increase to around 65-70kg per plant in 10 months. Similarly, yield of coloured capsicum and cucumber is around 4kg per plant, which will increase by six times to 24kg per plant, he informed. Such innovations will help in doubling the income of farmers, he added.The crop will be grown vertically to accommodate more plants in the same area, thus increasing the yield. More production of vegetables will help in curbing hike in prices and common man can get quality vegetables at affordable prices, he said.Once it is started at Bassi, hydroponics will be propagated to farmers in the state, he said. Even during these two years of pilot move, an Indian version of hydroponics technique will be developed so that farmers can afford it, he added.The agriculture department has sanctioned 13 crore for the two-year project starting from June this year. Saini said the department has constituted a committee to speed up the project. The project will be supervised by Rajasthan Olive Cultivation Limited (ROCL)."

By March 15, the botanists aim to scan more than 25,000 specimens and will send the digital images to the BSI.The BSI mooted the proposal in 2013 and it took them more than five years to ink the deal. The pioneer flora institute has plans to send 12 more botanists to London so that the scanning can be completed within a year to streamline the database, Singh said.The Portuguese introduced potato and tomato to India, he said.Being a staple food item in India, there is a need to identify the species that belong to the family, he said.We know of kand-mool, which has reference in historical transcripts but it was replaced by potato and tomato.The specimens at the London museum will help us to identify alternates of the two crops so that we can harvest the plants as well.Botanists are also scanning plant species from neighbouring countries, including Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar and this will help in understanding the genesis of different plant species."

5aead26a9855b73f522c3ae0,Hi-Tech Farming: Can Rajasthan Make the Desert Bloom?,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hi-tech-farming-can-rajasthan-make-the-desert-bloom/story-m4jKdmwjXCpFLDhWCmhMAM.html,2018-02-22,,Hindustan Times,"Neat furrows of cabbage, uniformly spaced cherry tomatoes, bell peppers and pomegranates, and exotic fruits, make the International Horticulture Innovation and Training Centre near Jaipur a veritable horticultural Disneyland.The technologies on display are striking: slim polyethylene hoses with small nozzles run along the length of the plantations; the jets shoot water mixed with fertilizer directly at the roots; climate-controlled greenhouses create balmy conditions, just right for the plants inside.Hi-tech in farming, however, is not easy. In Rajasthan, modernisation faces a typical structural hurdle. The share of marginal and small land-holdings in total land ownership in the state is 40.12% and 21.90% respectively, according to the states Economic Survey 2017-18. Such highly skewed land distribution itself makes the use of even simpler tools, such as a tractor, uneconomical.A document on Rajasthans agriculture challenges by the Niti Aayog in 2016 cites this as a major barrier in effective intervention in the advancement of agriculture.Yet, Indias largest state with 61% arid or semi-arid climate and 35 million in poverty (those with less than Rs 1 lakh in annual income) wants to do an Israel in agriculture: make the desert bloom.It has, over the last couple of years, set up six hi-tech centres, such as the one outside Jaipur, to disseminate cutting-edge Israeli horticulture technologies. Three more are in the works. No state has so many Centres of Excellence.The six are in Kota (citrus fruits), Bassi (pomegranates), Jaiselmers Sagra Bhojhka (date palm), Devravas in Tonk district (guavas), Jhalawar (mandarins), and Khemri Dholpur ( mangoes). Three more are coming: Chittor (pumpkin), Boondi district (vegetables) and Sawai Madhopur (flowers). There is an olive programme as well.We have got the best technologies from countries such as Israel and Netherlands for these centres of excellence, says agriculture minister Prabhulal Saini.Why would a state with diverse farm produce want to go big on fruits and vegetables more suited for the overseas palate? Rajasthan is after all Indias largest producer of mustard, with a 48% share in national output. Despite being mostly arid, it is also the countrys largest producer of bajra (pearl millet), guar (cluster beans) and coarse cereals, apart from spices.Where state stands Agriculture comprises 27% ofRajasthans gross domestic productOn all-India basis, the state ranks second in total pulses and oilseeds as well as milk output. The main justification is that Rajasthans topography and agro-climatic conditions are similar to Israels. The Jewish state has been known for its agricultural success using innovation. Rajasthan too, the logic goes, can go from being David to Goliath in agriculture.There are both supporters and critics of this new strategy that aims to shift a sizeable section of middle farmers away from traditional water-guzzling crops, such as wheat.The idea is to make them grow citrus fruits and vegetables with water-economising technologies. In these crops, the state could do better, just like Israel. So, its looking at a mixed cropping patterns. A little maths and youll understand, says director horticulture VP Singh. Input costs in traditional crops are rising. Agree? And farmers returns are falling, he says.Greenhouse cucumber production gives an average 50 tonne of average production. The average cost of cucumber is about Rs 20 per kg. So thats Rs 10 lakh in total revenue. If total costs are Rs 3-4 lakh, that means saving of around Rs 6 lakh.On paper, this makes sense. On the ground, the task is neither easy nor cheap. One hurdle is funds. The number of applications from farmers aspiring to go high-tech is low but still far higher than earmarked subsidies can support.Moreover, farmers cant be dictated on what to grow and how much water to use. Israel overcame its water crisis by imposing huge tariffs on excessive water consumption. At the peak of a drought in 2010, citizens were asked to cut their shower time. Israelis couldnt wash cars with hoses.We cant do all that here. Rajasthan should not be growing much wheat. Where is the water? But you cant ban it. All we can do is give them alternatives, says Neelkamal Darbari, the states principal secretary.Agriculture  which contributes 27% to states GDP  has seen volatile returns mainly because of rainfall swings. For instance, in 2013-14, farm GDP grew an impressive 6.8%. That slowed to 2.6 in 2014-15. The next year (2015-16), farm growth almost flattened at 0.78%. It rebounded in 2016-17 at 6.3%.To popularise high value horticulture, the Vasundhara Raje-led state government launched a series of events to showcase technological demonstrations and attract investments.Three chapters of the Global Rajasthan Agritech Meet have been held so far  at Jaipur in November 2016, Kota in May 2017 and Udaipur in November, 2017. Approximately 1.23 lakh farmers participated in these events. They saw technology with their own eyes, Saini says. These events also led to 40 agreements worth Rs 1,555.83 crore for investments in agriculture and allied sectors, according to a government document.Until these investments come through, state subsidies are the only way. Protected cultivation is expensive. Since there is great demand, we will need substantially more funds, says Singh.Protected cultivation refers to a package of practices requiring capital investments in equipment such as greenhouses, shade-nets and micro-irrigation.The mission faces a classic budget constraint. The first limitation is that the National Horticulture Missions spending limit for protected cultivation is 25% of the total budget (of about Rs 150 crore annually). Farmers need to submit plans for a minimum of 2000 square meters (half an acre) to avail a subsidy of Rs 10 lakh (or 50% of the costs, whichever is lower). A protected-cultivation farm on one acre (4000 sq m) costs about Rs 35 lakh.Currently, the government has received about 1,500 applications from farmers for 5000 acres. For protected cultivation, the subsidy allotted is Rs 32 crore. Given that each farmer is entitled to Rs 10 lakh, only 320  or just 21%  can be covered in the short-term.If in a district, there are 100 applicants, then the waiting time can stretch up to 5 years, Singh adds. One of those in the queue is 50-year-old Bishen Paroda outside Sikar town, who says he wants to grow cucumber.To reduce the waiting time, Rajasthan has increased the subsidy limit to 70% from 50% for smaller farmers and sought to link them with bank loans. The Niti Aayog review says the subsidy for all types of farmers should be raised to 70%, otherwise the scheme could be adversely affected.Critics of the programme say Rajasthan cant take its eyes off traditional crops because thats what the majority grows. From an experiment point of view, hi-tech horticulture is fine. But there must be an income boost from traditional crops which employs the most people, says Bhagirath Choudhary, the director of the New Delhi-based South Asia Biotechnology Centre, who hails from the state."

I have not been able to recover the cost of cultivation due to the low prices of tomatoes, said Saini.Wholesalers at the wholesale fruit and vegetable mandi in Kota Prakash Batwani said that last year tomato prices were around Rs 25 per kg till December and around Rs 80 in July last year. However, at present, the prices are Rs 4 to Rs 8 per kg.The retail prices of tomato are around Rs 8 to Rs 10 per kg, he said.Giving reasons for the low prices, he said that tomato production increases in Kota and nearby areas in winter due to which prices come down around this time every year.Production of tomatoes in Bundi, Deoli region of Tonk, Kota, Sawai Madhopur and other nearby areas goes up in January-February every year. Due to this, tomato prices drop. But the prices go up during the monsoon season when there is no production of tomatoes locally and it is brought from other states such as Maharashtra and Karnataka, said Girish Dalwani , a tomato wholesaler.According to the horticulture department, tomato is cultivated on approximately 3,500 hectares of land in Kota division."

(Express photo by Kevin DSouza) A foodie, Ankita Raina has shed her calorific intemperance to improve her fitness. (Express photo by Kevin DSouza)The delicately delicious onion-tomato orgy on mutton for the Rogan Josh, was the biggest sacrifice Ankita Raina remembers making at the altar of tennis success. Olive oil drizzled salads and the bland pasta staple replaced the waft of a wonder memory of that Kashmiri kernel.Ankitas journey will continue from a strong showing at the Fed Cup in Delhi to the next port of call as she tries to better her ranking beyond 222the highest she reached around the time the last Fed Cup was played in India at Hyderabad in 2015. Indias No 1 takes flights mostly now, but recalled the train journey she undertook alone in 2012 as a 19-year-old finding her perfect Rogan Josh. I was playing a tournament in Delhi and realised itd been long since I visited my grandparents in Kashmir. First, all the cousins had planned to go, but then everyone else chickened out. There is a lot of strife there, but Kashmir is really heaven on earth, I found a lot of sukoon (peace) there at that time, she had said, speaking in the summer of 2015. Also, I really like mutton cooked in our Kashmiri stylewith lots of onion and tomatoes. That impulsive train journey was memorable, shed added with a sigh.Ankita is accustomed to long, meandering journeys in tennisand not just matches that last 2 hours-24 minutes, and 2 hours-53 the next day to beat Chieh-Yu Hsu incidentally Indias longest Fed Cup tie over the last weekend in Delhi. I always loved travelling by train as a child, and hated returning home. Tennis took me to places like Kavali in Andhra, Gulbarga and Mandya and I started travelling alone at 14. It used to be scary sometimes  new places, new culture, but I realised I dont panic immediately. Also you cant stop trains by pulling chains in Morocco! she laughs retelling her pet tale.Ankita Rainas oft-told Casablanca story involves a miss and a sigh. Followed by some shrill, hysterical cries of Pull it again, man! as she tried to stop a train she was travelling in, by cranking repeatedly at the first thing resembling a chain, with a friend screaming nearby.The pair of them, teenaged tennis players from India, had landed at Casablanca and were to take a connecting train from the basement of the airport to Rabat in Morocco for a junior tournament. The two misheard announcements alternating in Arabic and French and would miss their station just as Ankita  an accomplished train traveller back home owing to her India-wide criss-crossing for ITF juniors meets, immediately scanned around for a chain to pull and bring the train to a halt. Its when she rushed to the door pressing frantically at the buttons  that the chaos reached a crescendo. The pair were slapped a fine of 6000 dirhams. This opened the floodgates of the bawling friend. When the TC came, I told him how we were headed for a tennis tournament, and were traveling alone. We were very little and howling, and they finally understood and put us on the train back, she recalled.Indias top singles player at World No 253 has had a different graph than the countrys high-achieving predecessor in singlesSania Mirza. At 25, the results havent come in a bunch and she continues to battle to climb every step of the rankings ladder. The turbulence on the flight up hasnt quite stopped. My first flight alone was to Hyderabad and I told people I was 15. I was actually carrying a note from parents that said I was 12 and needed supervision, she recalled. Other adventures include winning a meet in Muzaffarnagar, watched by a ring of phlegmatic policemen guarding the tournament in the crime-infested area.When you dont hit the double digits of rankings early in tennis, theres a lot of unglamorous detours and wrong trains where life inadvertently takes you. Remaining undefeated in singles through a zonal Fed Cup week in your national capital has taken time to happen, with the double-fisted backhand and the serve variations for speed and placement, still being work in progress.Though her father accompanied her to meets in her pre-teens, it was her mum who nudged her into tennis. I started at 4. My mother was a sports enthusiast who did athletics and TT. Travelling with a parent though means double the cost so I had to learn to fend for myself very early, she added. The family had first watched Tim Henman play a Satellite Challenger at Ahmedabad where young Ankita chased the Brit for autographs, and it was from watching Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi that the girl started falling for the game.After some male players from Ahmedabad started training at Hemant Bendres academy in Pune, Ankita would shift too. Though her favourite surface for her aggressive game remains grass, shed do well on hard courts even while practicing on clay taking her time to learn the proper clay game of slices and slugging. Ankita favoured the chip and charge and took a liking for the drop shotsomething she used when downing Yulia Putintseva, the 81-ranked combustible Kazakh. As a kid, Ankita started loving smacking the ball and didnt hold back even if they kept landing long and thumping against fences at Ahmedabad.The forehand was developing into a weapon, but in 2012 shed run into a Chinese at a meet to secure a wildcard for the Australian Open who kept banging the ball with such menace that rallying at that speed got impossible. She would double her gym work to gain that kind of power, and though she detested running rounds, weight training soon became the favourite part of her workout. I have puked during running sessions though to try and get to that level of stamina, she recalled. 2013 would see her change her diet after extensive travel and oily food gave her acidity and sore throats during matches. I was a foodie. Then suddenly my dietician was telling me about olive oil and eating right, she said.All the time she would be wracked by the perennial dilemmawhether to chase titles at smaller events that fetched her headlines to woo the sponsors, or whether to play the higher graded meets of WTA and push for ranking points. All my time was spent making decisionstaking gambles on meets and balancing risks, one eye at the entry date, the other at withdrawals. Retreating from Japan, going to Marrakesh. After the last Fed Cup, Sania advised me on which tournaments to pick. When she was coming up, she was an inspiration and it was a dream to try play like her. Everyone used to say, Indians are not that strong, and we dont have the genes for tennis. Its difficult but Sania proved its possible, she added.On rough days, the family including brother Ankur, would be rushing from embassy to airportwith Ankita taking in her stride different cities and time zonesjust trying to get to the venue, tired and spent and losing in the first round as a result. There are times when Id feel low and not confident. But Id think that when I succeed all the praise will be for me, while my family is doing it all selflessly, she said.Her transition from juniors to seniors was typically protracted, and shed seek help of a psychologist. Ankita frequently started using the drop shot in stiff tie breakers. After a point, finishing the crunch matches is all mental, she had said, after a few close matches at the Fed Cup went the other way.From 2015 to now, Raina seems to have sorted out her end-game and won all her singles matches this time. Her parents whod watched Sharapova win the Wimbledon in 2004, would chip in with advice: how Cibulkova was always on her toes and jumping on court, how Ivanovic picked everything on the rise, how Federer stayed calm and Nadal covered the court. I went through a phase where I used to be confused  I wanted to be calm and aggressive also at the same time, she chuckled, adding that though she used to be shy off-court, she could pull out the fangs when playing.Ankita, meanwhile faced problems that tennis divinity rarely does. First it was tough to travel much, then I started feeling the need for a physio. The shoulder would get tight when I pushed too hard in training, she said. Shed stack up some good results in doubles in makeshift partnerships, but it needed solid singles results for Raina to grab eyeballs.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

A misal-pav stall run by the Tellis family has been dishing out the street favourite between 4 am and 7 am for long enough to do without advertising. From selling tea, driving an autorickshaw and now selling misal, the Tellis family has always preferred the night to make a living. Elar Tellis, popularly known as Michael, came to Mumbai from his native Mangalore 45 years ago. Starting off with a tea stall, the story of his misal-pav joint at Sarvodaya Nagar in Mulund West unfolds at night. The joint mainly attracts corporate employees who work until the early hours, along with a younger crowd on their way home from late night parties.I had a tea stall in Mangalore, but as I didnt earn enough for my family, I came to Mumbai when I was 14 years old on my friends suggestion. I initially started working at stalls at the Andheri railway station and later, worked at Bandra. But I always wanted to have my own business, Michael said. He then started selling tea in Mulund along with his two younger brothers.After working with others for five years, I learnt how to run a business in Mumbai, so I started my own and got my two brothers Marshal and Xavier on board, said Michael, adding that he had been witness to the transformation of the eastern suburb of Mulund from a forest area to a residential one.I would start selling tea at 4 am as I was told that in Mumbai, I would end up earning more money as people usually step out at night and look for tea stalls. However, I didnt earn much by selling tea. We then took a loan and bought a rickshaw which my brother would drive. He drove during night hours and I would drive during the day after selling tea in the early hours, he said.With a loan to repay, Michael then decided to make good on his idea to start an eatery. In the initial days of his tea stall, a family ran an eatery next to it, recalled Michael. However, suddenly one day, the family closed the stall and disappeared.Michaels son Santosh Tellis said: My father saw that the eatery had been closed for many days, following which he got the idea of starting his own. Then, we set up the stall and started selling misal from 3 am to 7 am. During the initial days, we were incurring heavy losses as we didnt attract too many customers. But, after Ganesh Chaturthi, we started getting business and we started recovering the losses. People would come to our stall aftervisarjan and eat misal, and that is how word spread across Mulund. Since then, the Tellis family has been running a misal joint at night, following which they return to their day jobs  the father runs a tea stall and the son is employed with an online shopping portal.Michael and Santosh wake up at 2 am, and after preparing a hearty dish of misal, the duo start selling it at around 4 am. I have to sleep early at night so that I can wake up early, following which I have to report to my job at 10 am. As my father is ageing, we have also hired two person to take care of our tea stall while my father supervises the business during the day, said Santosh.The midnight misal is served at Rs 40 per plate with two pavs. The stall also sells taripav at Rs 10 per piece. They attract customers from Ghatkopar, Powai, Thane, Bhandup and Airoli. In taripav, we basically mix ingredients of misal, like sprouts, moth beans, farsan, tomatoes, onions, boiled potatoes, lemon and coriander and then hand it over to the customer, said Santosh. Between 4 am and 6 am, the joint is crowded with customers, and many of them end up asking for takeaways.A resident of Mulund, Varun Ghatani, said: My personal favourite is taripav, and whenever I go out with my friends for night-outs, I see to it that I visit Michael and eat taripav.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

And while a majority of Indian farmers cultivate their own land, Dalit farmers in much of the country continue to work for wages, data released last week by the Census of India confirms.The data shows that 71% of Scheduled Caste farmers are what the census refers to as agricultural labourers  that is, they work for wages on others land. That figure is much lower among other groups: 47% for Scheduled Tribe farmers and 41% for non-SC/ST farmers.We are thinking of the agricultural community as one group, and providing it with a number of sops, said Nilanjan Ghosh, a senior fellow and head of economics at the non-partisan Observer Research Foundation in Kolkata. But the benefit is essentially being obtained by landowners, and it hardly goes to the labourers. We dont have anything for them. Other economists agreed. Any gains from these policies are unlikely to be passed down in terms of higher wages, Ashwini Deshpande, a professor at the University of Delhis School of Economics, said in an email. On the whole it would be safe to say that, by and large, these policies do not touch agricultural labour.Wages for agricultural labourers have not increased in the last four years, according to Himanshu, a professor at the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi. This, even as the Centre and states have introduced policies meant to alleviate farmer distress  loan waivers, crop insurance, and increased MSP, which ensure that farmers make a profit on their produce. Even if big farmers or medium farmers have access to the minimum support price, it is not necessary that they will pass on that benefit to agricultural labourers, Ghosh said.In fact, there is no such study which shows that agricultural labourers are going to be affected from an increase in the minimum support price or even from farm loan waivers.Landlessness among Dalits has deep historical roots.For centuries, Dalits were expressly prohibited from owning land. Even if reforms after Independence have helped level the playing field, economic and social pressures over the last two decades have increased the proportion of landless farmers across all social sectors.The land is limited. As the population is increasing, pressure on land is also increasing, Himanshu said. It is expected that some increase would happen in the level of agricultural labourers over time.Regardless of caste or class, life is generally harder for landless farmers, according to Jayshree Sengupta of the Observer Research Foundations Economy and Development Programme.There is more incidence of suicides among agricultural labour than farmers/cultivators because they do not have access to any type of formal institutional loans and loan waivers have bypassed them. Around 70% of labourers are in debt, Sengupta said in an email."

This claim requires clarity, says Kavitha Kuruganti of the Alliance for Sustainable & Holistic Agriculture, in an interview with Zia Haq. Kuruganti was a member of the Ramesh Chand Committee on farm prices.The FM announced MSPS will be set at 1.5 times over costs of production, or 50% returns. He hasnt clarified if this increase will be over the so called C2 costs of cultivation, which is the main demand, or A2 costs. Can you explain why this is vital?In terms of cost accounting principles and practice, it is important to get a comprehensive picture of costs, which include opportunity costs. That will then give you a good picture of net returns. The Commission on Agricultural Costs and Prices itself calculates net returns in terms of C2 cost and not A2 (paid out components + family labour). C2 is a cost estimation, which (unlike A2) also includes rental value of own land and value of owned fixed capital assets. The reason why the government should exclude these two additional components also -while it includes imputed family labour on own land -in its selective cost definition, is irrational. Meanwhile, in the Ramesh Chand Committee report, we pointed out to various other ways in which cost is suppressed. That needs to be addressed too.People have argued that farmers costs are underestimated.While that is the theoretical part of the issue at debate here, what is important to realise is that official data is clearly showing that our farmers are in distress. Their income is not growing. A majority of farmers has negative net returns. The intersectoral disparities are increasing, which are not good in any society. There is also a moral imperative, that farmers are keeping us all alive, and we owe it to them.So are you saying the MSP claim is misleading?Prices are clearly the most proximal and direct ways to improve incomes. The government should stop trying to cheat farmers here. This government has given significantly lower margins on an average, whichever cost definition you adopt, compared to the earlier government. This, despite explicitly promising at least 50% margins over the cost of production. They have to make good on their promises.What are the kind of returns farmers are now getting? In terms of the ground reality, is it true that MSPS for the current rabi sown season gave 50% returns, as claimed by the finance minister?The NSSOS (National Sample Survey Office) 70th round shows that most farmers have monthly incomes lower than their monthly basic expenses. The average per day per capita earning in our farm households is lower than the legally prescribed minimum wages for agricultural workers in the country. The finance minister made an incorrect statement when he said that in this rabi, they have provided 50% margins since wheat, which had the highest MSP rise, has just 38% margin over C2 costs of cultivation. Not a single rabi crop has touched a 50% margin over C2.Would you agree that this Budget has put the rural economy and agriculture back on the governments priority?I will not agree. It is true that the current farmers unrest and struggles, in addition to recent election results, have put farmers back on the national debate, but the government hasnt incorporated any concrete thing that would address farmers problems. Only 2.3% of the entire budget has been given to agriculture. In fact, this government is being unresponsive and irresponsible towards farmers.Do you think Operation Greens for higher values through processing from tomato, onions and potatoes is a step towards focusing on incomes end of the spectrum?The details of this are yet to be seen. What we have been asking for is an MSP for these perishables also, which is guaranteed to farmers, in a statutory manner, along with other agri commodities."
5aeae8af9855b73f522c4a90,Budget 2018: Jaitley Promises Farmers 50% Returns over Cultivation Costs,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/budget-2018-jaitley-promises-farmers-50-returns-over-cultivation-costs/story-C5oo7V5HT9c9vRjF5CrNlM.html,2018-02-02,,Hindustan Times,"Kicking off with a burst of announcements for the farm sector, finance minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday said the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government would deliver on its promise of ensuring 50% returns for farmers, seeking to address rural angst due to collapsing prices.In his budget speech, Jaitley said federally determined minimum support prices (MSPs) for summer-sown (kharif) crops this year would be set at 1.5 times the cost of cultivation, which translates to 50% returns.This has been a key demand by protesting farmers in several agriculturally developed states, such as Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.Jaitley surprised critics by declaring that his government had already adhered to this pricing benchmark for most crops in the ongoing rabi-sown (winter) season. He said this would be henceforth applied for the rest of crops. The government has decided to keep MSP for the all unannounced crops of kharif at least at one and half times of their production cost, he said.The finance minister did not announce any specific price-deficit payment scheme to compensate farmers directly for market losses when prices dip below MSPs, as was widely anticipated. Such a scheme is already being implemented in Madhya Pradesh. He, instead, said that Niti Ayog would soon come out with a foolproof mechanism on how to compensate farmers when prices crash.The budget announcement comes amid a rough patch in the agriculture sector, forecast to grow just 2.1% in 2017-18, as against 4.9% in the previous year. The announcement of 50% returns over costs set off a flurry of debate on the fine print, with farm leaders wondering which of the two measures of cultivation costs  the so-called C2 or A2 + FL  the government would adopt. Jaitley did not specify the measure that will be used.C2 is a more comprehensive measure of a farmers cultivation costs, which includes imputed rental value of land, depreciation and interests on capital. These are not part of the A2+FL, a narrower measure that includes input costs and imputed value of only family labour.The crux of the battle on prices boils down to the governments definition on cost of productionThe government seems to have chosen a lower cost measure so that it can declare that it is already providing cost + 50% in this rabi, said Kiran Vissa of the Rythu Swarajya Vedika, part of a platform of farmer organisations. He said when PM Narendra Modi had promised 50% returns in his election campaign, MSPs were already giving higher returns than under Modis tenure.In 2007, the MS Swaminathan Committee had recommended 50% returns for crops, which the BJPs 2014 poll manifesto adopted. In the para containing the specific recommendation, the Swaminathan report said MSP should be 50% over costs of cultivation, not specifying which measure. But in its annexure, the report used C2 costs to calculate net farmer returns.Economist Ashok Gulati told HT that for rabi crops, the MSP was closer towards 50% of costs. In wheat, it is in the region of 44%-45%, but in other crops it is just 20%-30%. The real challenge is for kharif crops. In paddy, MSPs and returns are not more than 10%-12%, he said. If the government actually sets MSPs at 1.5 times the C2 costs, then it would also mean a huge jump in the food subsidy bill and make Indias produce expensive in the exports market, he said.The budget announced a new scheme called Operation Greens to promote value addition for tomato, onion and potato. This would be similar to Operation Flood that revolutionsed the dairy sector, Jaitley said. Two funds to boost fisheries and animal husbandry were allotted Rs10,000.The budget also set a target of Rs11 lakh crore for agriculture credit in 2018-19, a 10% rise. Jaitley said 22,000 new and existing rural marketplaces would be developed to give farmers access to buyers. Tenant farmers would be made eligible for farm loans under a new policy, he said, adding a liberalised farm-exports regime was in the works. Various ministries will have Rs14.34 lakh crore in all to create rural jobs and infrastructure.With a view to boost food processing, which can improve commodity prices, allocation to the food processing ministry was being doubled from Rs715 crore in 2017-18 to Rs1,400 crore in 2018-19, Jaitley said."

Tracing gold supply is key to preventing metal that funds armed conflict from entering world markets, identifying owners and maintaining security from mine to vault.The LBMA has pushed ahead with efforts to modernize a trade that until recent years relied on phone auctions to set a key benchmark price for the market.For us, its a question of where the gold comes from, Mirza said.The LBMA oversees a list of refiners approved to supply the London market. Its London Good Delivery List sets global standards for large gold and silver bars. The LBMA will also study tagging the metal and using other security features to ensure bars are exactly what they say they are, it said in a statement on Tuesday.Everything that ends up in an LBMA good-delivery refiner needs to be tracked in the supply chain, regardless of whether it ends up as a large bar in a London vault, a kilo bar shipped to the Far East, or a coin owned by a collector, Mirza said. A lot has been done already but its still very paper-based. We now want to formalize it through an efficient and possibly technologically based solution. Bloomberg"

In fact, DySP Srinivas, Puttur Rural Circle Inspector Gopal Naik, Uppinangady Sub Inspector Nandakumar and other police personnel were camping in Mithamajalu since morning.When ANF members showed the photographs of a few Maoists to the inmates of the house, they (residents) said that the Maoists have identified themselves as ""Rajesh"" and ""Latha"".Mithamajalu, situated two-kilometres away from National Highway has 40 houses, of which three houses are situated on the periphery of the forest. The Maoist members had visited the houses on Sunday night. However, it was kept a secret till Monday evening. It was through schoolchildren that the news was spread among the villagers.Puttur DySP Srinivas said that the visit of Maoists to the houses has been confirmed. Two teams of ANF have started combing operations.'Did not threaten'One of the residents of the house that the Maoists visited said, ""The members just informed that they were Maoists and asked us not to inform anyone. They did not threaten us.""A team with two men and a woman entered the house at 7.30 pm on Sunday. After introducing themselves as Purushotham, Rajesh and Latha, they asked for groceries. ""When I informed that there is no rice and asked them whether they needed dosa and tea, they replied in the negative."" They also wanted to know whether there is any rich person's house in the village, the resident said.When my brother visited the house, they accompanied him to his house. They were in my house for 10 minutes only. All were wearing green trousers and shirt and were armed, the resident said.Her brother said, ""Maoist Rajesh asked for 10 kg of rice. When I said there are no shops nearby, they demanded rice from the house.

Researchers in the city have come up with a do-it-yourself solution to protect yourself from poison that might be on your plate. Mix 160 ml of acetic acid with 4 grams of baking soda and concentrated juice of 4 lemons in 4 litres of water. Use this to was your vegetables to ensure that pesticides are removed.A student of Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University (PJTSAU) conducted a study to find out efficacy of tap water and various liquid solutions that can be made at home to remove pesticide residues from vegetables.Comparison of the efficacy of these methods revealed that the solution of acetic acid, baking soda, lemon juice and water in right proportions was much more efficient in removing the pesticide residues compared to the use of only tap water.The study by Sudhakar S Kelageri of PJTSAU published recently in the Journal of Entomology and Zoology Studies reports that dipping tomatoes for 10 minutes in a solution of 160 ml of acetic acid with 4 grams of baking soda and lemon juice from 4 lemons in 4 litres of water followed by washing off the tomatoes with tap water, could remove pesticides residues in the range of 55-76 percent.This formulation is developed by All India Network Project on Pesticide Residues at PJTSAU and is named as Veggy wash. Compared to Veggy wash, the efficacy of washing vegetables with only tap water was just around 17-39 per cent.Effectiveness of Veggy wash was checked on five pesticides - Dimethoate, lambda-Cyhalothrin, Flubendiamide and Profenophos which are widely used by farmers on tomato, a vegetable that finds high usage in Indian cooking as well as in salads for raw consumption. While the published study was on tomato, these five pesticides find wide usage in other vegetables as well.It was found that Veggy wash could remove 76.7 per cent of dimethoate, 68.8 percent of lambda-Cyhalothrin, 55.1 per cent of phosalone, 65.3 per cent of flubendiamide and 75.8 per cent of profenofos. It may be mentioned here that profenofos is widely used on vegetables in India although it is not recommended for usage on vegetables by Central Insecticide Board and Registration Committee and it is listed as moderately hazardous by World Health Organization. Another effective solution listed in the study was 4 percent acetic acid solution prepared by mixing 160 ml of acetic acid in 4 litres of water."

The Sabarmati ashram is sited between a jail and a crematorium, and Gandhi believed that a Satyagraha invariably had to go to either place. He is believed to have said, This is the right place for our activities to carry on the search for Truth and develop fearlessness, for on one side are the iron bolts of the foreigners, and on the other the thunderbolts of Mother Nature.It was also from here that he launched the famous Dandi March or Salt Satyagraha in 1930, in protest against the increased taxes on Indian salt in an effort to promote sales of British salt in India.Adalaj VavGujarat has some beautiful step wells and this is certainly one of them. This intricately carved five storeys deep step well was started in the 15th century by Rana Veer Singh to alleviate the misery of his subjects who had to face severe water shortage and completed by a Muslim king, Mehmud Begda in the Indo-Islamic architectural style.Built in sandstone it is octagonal at the top, and stands on a large number of gorgeously carved pillars. Spacious, each floor can accommodate sizeable congregations. The floral motifs and Islamic graphics blend rather well with the Hindu symbols carved at various levels of the well. The carvings depict women in daily chores like churning of buttermilk, adorning themselves, dancers and musicians performing, and the King overlooking all these activities. Dont be surprised if you find hordes of tourists filling every possible space in the huge stepwell, most of them in the serious pursuit of either posing for pictures or indulging in taking selfies.Sidi Saiyyed MosqueThis mosque is famous for beautifully carved ten stone latticework windows on the side and rear arches. This intricately carved lattice stone window is the Sidi Saiyyed Jali, the unofficial symbol of city of Ahmedabad and the inspiration for the design of the logo of the Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad. Our visit coincided with the Maghrib prayers: in the midst of a chaotic traffic, the mosque lent serenity and the soft light from the ambience further enhanced its beauty.Teen DarwazaKing Ahmed Shah built this historical gate in the 15 century. This is where we found the most chaotic and undisciplined traffic. The roads were overflowing with people, hawkers, small time shopkeepers with mountains of goods, and ruthless two wheeler drivers with intimidating horns.Manek ChowkHere the street food stalls at night are a big attraction. It is a vegetable market in the morning, a jewellery market (supposed to be the second biggest in India) in the noon and a street food market at night. The food stalls start to emerge around 9:30 in the evening and continue till late night. The mouth-watering snacks make you ignore the not so clean surroundings. Besides many delicacies, Manek Chowk is best known for its kulfi but we had fafda (that came with a chutney setting the tongue on fire) and hot jalebis: an unusual combination.PolsIt is worth seeing a Pol in the old Ahmedabad. They contain old beautiful houses with internal courts having intricate wooden carved facades with columns and fresco work done around court walls or ceilings. Pol architecture is an interesting evolution in urban living space.The word pol is derived from the Sanskrit word pratoli meaning entrance to an enclosed area. Pols were originally made as a protection measure when communal riots necessitated greater security probably dating from 1738 during Mughal-Maratha rule (1738-1753) in Ahmedabad. A typical pol would have only one or two entrances and also some secret entrances known only to people residing in a pol.Sasu Ji for lunchOne of the best places to taste an authentic Gujarati thaali as the warm and hospitable staff pampers you. We started with many bowls of baasundi, tiny Malpuas dripping with sugar syrup; Cheese Wonton (?? Chinese?? Yes!!), Shahi Dhokla, Patra for starters (Farsan), for the main course it was Paneer Pasanda, Undhiyu (a mixed vegetable dish with muthia-dumplings made with fenugreek leaves and spiced besan), Batata Tameta (tomato?), methi papad, poories, rice, rotisof course, you cant finish all this, however generous Sasu ji is!Mirch Masala for dinnerA themed restaurant, based on old Hindi films, here you have paintings of Kaka (Rajesh Khanna) and other film stars staring at you from every wall. We polished platefuls of kebabs as Hrithik Roshan watched us lovingly.Law GardenShopping cant get any better. The goods are attractive, prices quite reasonable.

The red wine sangria is also a good option  sweeter and full of fruit than sangrias served in most other places.TGIF has a number of options in appetisers. From egg-heavy dishes such as Breakfast Tacos and Breakfast Potato Skins, to fried food for the hungover soul. We tried the Calamari Frites, and though hesitant to try shellfish in places not directly on the coast, we found this dish to be fresh, crispy and delicious, complemented perfectly with marinara sauce. We also tried the Friday Mushrooms - crispy batter fried mushrooms served with a sauce.For mains, we first tried the Classic American Veg Pizza, and though not up to par with the some of the great pizza Bengaluru has been serving up of late, it does have a very homemade feel to it. The Pasta Alfredo is not for the faint hearted or the almost-full, as it is very creamy and rich, just the way an Alfredo ought to be. The winner among the mains for us was the Hangover Burger, again, meant for someone with a hearty appetite. This delicious monster has a juicy lamb patty paired with bacon, caramelized onions and all your other burger fixings, and is topped off with a fried egg. Some of the other good options among the mains are the Steak and Eggs and the Crispy Chicken Sliders.For dessert, we thought wed keep it simple, and the brunch menu has also stuck to the same theme by only listing two dishes. We tried the Sizzling Brownie, and it was one of the best weve had in recent times, and also much bigger than most. Served with large scoop of vanilla ice cream and generous amounts of chocolate sauce, it was the perfect end to this gastronomic meal.The Hangover brunch is on every Saturday and Sunday, 12 noon to 3 pm. Prices start at ` 1,695."

Photo: AlamyAmong the many ways of looking at Frankenstein, and by Frankenstein one necessarily means not just Mary Shelleys groundbreaking book but what that book birthed over 200 yearsas other authors, playwrights, theatre producers and film-makers prodded away at it, moving body parts around in their sinister laboratorieshere is one interpretation. It is about terrible and unhappy parents, terrible and unhappy children, and how, to misquote Philip Larkin, we pass misery back and forth.Youre Victor Frankenstein, you think youve done your best, but heres this monster you created, which refuses to be what you hoped it would be. Worse, it turns around and blames you for everything thats wrong. Look at the Paradise Lost lineDid I request thee, Maker, from my clay, To mould me Man?which serves as an epigraph for Shelleys novel, and then listen to director Guillermo del Toro, who is currently working on a Frankenstein film: Its the quintessential teenage book. You dont belong. You were brought to this world by people that dont care for you and you are thrown into a world of tears and hunger.Most parent-child relationships, when looked at over a period of time, bring high tragedy and slapstick comedy together in the same frame. Little wonder then that cinematic Frankensteins have inhabited every mode from deep seriousness to goofy, pseudo-science-driven humourand that the most enduring films accommodate both extremes.Consider one of the most effective scenes, gentle, idyllic and horrifying all at once, in James Whales 1931 Frankenstein. Boris Karloffs monster comes across a little girl, joins her in placing flowers on a lakes surface and watching them floatand then, in all innocence, dunks her into the water too, causing her death. So iconic was this momentoften censored in early screeningsthat 40 years later the Spanish director Vctor Erice made it the focal point of his coming-of-age narrative The Spirit Of The Beehive: the six-year-old protagonist Ana is traumatized when she watches the scene; in the days that follow, she becomes aware of subtler monsters in her own world.Or see Whales 1935 sequel, Bride Of Frankenstein, in which Karloffs plaintivenessas the monster yearns for a companion who will love and understand himbrushes up against Elsa Lanchesters brief but delightfully lunatic performance as his bride-not-to-be (the actress also played an impish Mary Shelley in a short scene).Those are still the two best-known Frankenstein films, and to modern eyes they can seem creaky and overwrought. Taking cues from theatre adaptations staged in Mary Shelleys lifetime, they turned Victor Frankenstein into the prototype of the mad scientist, shrieking that he knows what its like to be God (in the book he is a diligent, conscientious man). But Karloffs performance helps erase some of the differences. While the creature in Shelleys novel gains in eloquence and dignity once he learns to use language, the dumb movie monster is sympathetic by other means, conveying childlike pathos through his gestures and expressions. In fact, one can argue that in the broader-comedy scenes where he grunts wordsthe refrain of Good! Good! when an old hermit makes him taste bread and winehe becomes less likable.A still from Mary Shelleys Frankenstein. Photo: AlamyOf course, there are other films where the monster is not meant to be at all likablesee the 1957 Curse Of Frankenstein, starring those two masters of the Hammer Horror franchise, Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, and watch Lee play the role as a deformed, inexpressive zombie, starting with the shocking moment where he rips the bandages off his face as the camera zooms in on him.Another dominant mode is that of parody mixed with affection for the source material. Mel Brooks 1974 Young Frankenstein, shot in atmospheric black and white, has madcap scenes like the one where the doctors assistant brings along a brain labelled Abnormalthinking it belonged to someone named Abbie Normalbut the film also understands the sense of wonder and danger that permeates the original story. This is equally true of three 1980s filmsGothic, Haunted Summer and Rowing With The Windwhich arent straight renderings of the Frankenstein tale but dramatize the famous 1816 summer house party involving the Shelleys and Lord Byron, where both Frankenstein and the John Polidori horror story The Vampyre were conceived.And, of course, there are serious Frankenstein movies, which usually err on the side of earnestness. Kenneth Branaghs 1994 Mary Shelleys Frankenstein set out to be faithful to the book, in a way the Karloff films never did, but the promise was marred by half-hearted executionand ironically its best moments were the more inventive ones such as the scene where the naked creature (played by Robert De Niro, channelling a middle-aged Travis Bickle) slips about like a newborn baby in what looks like amniotic fluid.Frankenstein is often regarded as the first true science-fiction novel, and this perception has become increasingly relevant in our time, where Artificial Intelligence has taken on forms that Mary Shelley couldnt have envisioned. The idea of an imitation human being more humane in some ways than the flesh-and-blood people around him is a theme that has informed a lot of modern sci-fi about automatons: from the replicants in Blade Runner to the 1999 Bicentennial Man (adapted from Isaac Asimovs The Positronic Man) and Steven Spielbergs A.I. Artificial Intelligence (based on Brian Aldisss Supertoys Last all Summer Long, and often seen as a futuristic version of the Pinocchio story).But its just as instructive to go back in time, to two decades before the Karloff films, when a 12-minute Frankenstein was made by Thomas Edisons studio in 1910. Watching this relic (youll find it on YouTube) is like getting into a time machine: given that the world of the Shelleys seems so impossibly distant to us today, its unsettling to realize that the Edison film is closer in time (a mere 92 years) to the publication of the book than to our present day.What I find fascinating about that ancient filmas a cinema student and as someone who thinks of the Frankenstein story as being rooted in honest scientific curiosityis how much it does with the very limited motion-picture technology of the time. For instance, for the challenging scene in which the monster comes alive, a wax replica of a skeleton was placed in a vat and set afire until it dissolved and crumpled. They then played the film backward, so that the impression we get is of something hideous being forged out of fire and sitting upright after its limbs have formed.To watch that scene is to think of the imagination and daring required of early film-makers when they wanted to do something more ambitious than simply record reality. One could say those pioneers were kindred spirits of Victor Frankenstein, tinkering in their workshops until their children grew and became something vast and uncontrollable, slipping out of their godlike hands."
5aeb03a09855b73f522c5e43,Parottas from Deep Down South,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2018/jan/19/parottas-from-deep-down-south-1758979.html,2018-01-20,,The New Indian Express,"lSabyasachi Roy Chaudhuri ByExpress News ServiceHYDERABAD: Parottas or layered flour breads are popular in the southern states of India as well as the island country of Sri Lanka. Whereas Malabar parotta from Kerala is the most well-known among these, there are other variants like kothu, veechu, lappa and Ceylon parottas which are in demand in these places. It is said that the parotta recipes of South India did not migrate from the northern part of the country, instead, it was the Sinhalese workers in the southern part of Tamil Nadu and Kerala who brought these recipes from the island. The Arab traders visiting the coastline also had a role to play in this.Each type of parotta has its own unique style of preparation. For example, for making Veechu Parotta, a popular dish from Madurai, the dough is spun in the air to make the parotta thinner. The thin layered bread is then folded and fried in oil. This dish is popular in Southern Tamil Nadu and gets its name from veesu, which in Tamil means tossing in the air. Ceylon Paratha is a two-layered parotta usually stuffed with vegetables or meat. The parottas is normally served with a gravy known as salna as well as onion raita.Kothu Parotta is a completely different dish altogether. Roasted parottas are chopped into small pieces and sauted on a tawa with masala, and other ingredients like onions, tomatoes, chillies, egg and even meat. Beachside shacks in Sri Lanka are known for the varieties of Kothu Parottas that they rustle up. Seeing the parotta being prepared in front of you and the sound of chopping and mixing itself makes you feel hungry.Lappa is typically made with an egg filling and is widely known as muttai lappa in parts of Tamil Nadu. After preparation, the parotta is again covered with another layer of egg batter, before folding into triangular or square shapes and fried. The recipe has influences of Arabic cuisine with strong similarities with muttabaq, a popular Arabic dish.Pondy Parottas, with two outlets at Madhura Nagar and Hi-Tec City, brings all these types of parottas to Hyderabad. As per Rajasubbaiah who owns this place, the kothu parotta here is prepared in the special Karaikal style, where the masala is cooked on the tawa folded inside the parotta and then chopped into pieces. For Lappa, the stuffing is uniformly spread on the parotta directly on the tawa. They have chicken, mutton and seafood versions of the parottas, as well as kalaki, an omelette type egg delicacy popular in Tamil Nadu.Sabyasachi is a food enthusiast and blogs at www.foodaholix.in"

How does one make art so that it breathes politics and forces the viewer to return the gesture -- with an act of seeing? At the Art Heritage gallery this weekend, a group show of nine artists, mostly from Kerala, offer diverse perspectives.Gigi Scaria, GR Iranna, Baiju Parthan, Jyothi Basu, KP Reji, NN Rimzon, Pooja Iranna, Sumedh Rajendran and TV Santhoshs works form the second edition of the exhibition Negotiation in Contested Space  Part 1. Conceptualised by Renuka Sawhney, a writer who works in New York, it was first held in Mumbai in 2017. Veteran stage and costume designer and director, Art Heritage, Amal Allana has curated it for the Delhi edition.As in India today, Contested Space is about the different pulls that are dividing up the space or the ground we stand on, says Allana while pointing out to an artwork that illustrates this. KP Rejis Moving the Mountain is a startling image of what seems to be dead bodies wrapped in cloths of bright yellow hoisted atop a vehicle with no exit  no door or window  pulled from both sides by hooks.KP Rejis Moving the Mountain (Photo courtesy: KP Reji)Its almost as if an entire culture is being moved or trundled away by an armoured vehicle. The image does not identify the source of the threat but signifies that by the introduction of the curled hook, says Allana.In another of Rejis works, Fishes Under the Broken Bridge, children are seen at various stages of play in a semi-rural setting framed by coconut palms and hovering seagulls, while in the backdrop a plane crashes seemingly out of nowhere and men, unperturbed, keep standing on a bridge holding up their rods waiting for fish. The picture is rife with a sense of unease  the fishing rods seen from a particular angle seem like raised swords just before a strike.Gigi Scaria, Under the Water (Photo courtesy: Gigi Scaria)Pooja Iranna, Gates to yet another Spectacular World (Photo courtesy: Pooja Iranna)The theme of imminent danger, catastrophe or sudden collapse runs through all the art-works at the exhibition. Pooja Irannas Gates to Yet Another Spectacular World is an installation built with staple pins. As Sawhney writes in the catalogue, she uses the conformity and mundaneness of her material to create a double illusion. Stacked together, individual staples create a formidable sculpture or structure. But should one staple fall out or move out of place, the whole edifice may come apart. This mirrors the tentativeness and the instability of existence, adds Allana.Sumedh Rajendrans mixed media collage on grey, robotic workers marching to office as if they were soldiers, add another strand  that of precarity of urban existence  to the exhibition. Some of them are torso-less and headless and yet they seem to move automaton-like forward; to stop or pause in such circumstances would be unthinkable. The work alludes to the desperate and daily departure of human beings to fixed spaces such as the office, explains Allana.GR Irannas (untitled) work portraying a bundle of old journals with a flower sprouting from a corner is the only image of promise and expectation in this bleak, though striking exhibition. The paper may seem used and discarded but out of the Book of Knowledge springs hope, says Allana. And what can be more symbolic than that?Details: Till March 2, Art Heritage, 205, Tansen Marg, Triveni Kala Sangam. 11 am-7 pm, Sundays closed. Nearest metro station: Mandi House"
5aeb09f19855b73f522c632c,Bengaluru: Veggies get pocket-friendly,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2018/jan/19/bengaluru-veggies-get-pocket-friendly-1758226.html,2018-01-19,,The New Indian Express,"Ashwini M Sripad ByExpress News ServiceBENGALURU: With the supply of vegetables crossing three times the demand, vegetable prices have drastically dropped. Experts say that at least for the next two months the markets are expected to be filled with vegetables costing fraction of their prices prevailing a few days ago. In Karnataka, vegetable growers are more in Kolar, Bengaluru Rural, Chikballapur, Chitradurga, Ramanagara, Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar, Hassan and other places. With good rain this monsoon, growers could get good yield too. The price of many vegetables has come around Rs 20 per kilo which was more than Rs 70 a few months back. While the tomato has declined to Rs 11 per kilo, pumpukin is Rs 13 per kg, raddish is Rs 18, snake gourd is Rs 18, while beetroot and potato are Rs 22 per kg, according to the Horticultural Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS) price list.Former additional director (Fruits), Dr S V Hittalamani, explained that this was because the state witnessed good monsoon rainfall in 2017. The lakes and rivers had filled, and groundwater had charged up.With this, farmers used borewell for water and it was an advantage for vegetable growers to grow larger quantities of vegetables. If there is more supply than demand, naturally the price declines. This is what has happened now, he said.Citing an example, Hittalamani said tomatoes grown on 6,000 hectares of land yielded around one lakh tones of tomatoes. But this year, with more farmers using their land for growing tomatoes, they have used 18,000 hectares of land and grown three lakh tones of tomatoes as compared to last year. If the quantity is thrice, one can imagine the price slash. In winter season, tomatoes normally grow. This year, growers in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra have also grown good quantities of tomatoes. This means there is no demand for our tomatoes in these states, he said.People, vendors happyAruna, a resident of Rajarajeshwarinagar bought carrot, onion, potato, peas, beans, chilies and curry leaves, all half kg to one kg. Even after buying so much, my bill was hardly D100. I was happy to buy veggies this cheap, she said. She said just a couple of months back, she used to spend D250 for the same quantity of vegetables. The vendors too are happy. Carrot was D90 per kg just a couple of months ago, now it has dropped to D45. Similarly, potato was D80 per kg and it has fallen to D22. People do come to buy vegetables even if the price is increased, Rudresh, a vegetable vendor at Vijayanagar said. Another vendor, Mahesh at Shivajinagar, said customers are happy. We too are happy that they are buying more in quantity, he said.From less supply to tomato glutAccording to deputy director of horticulture department Chandrashekar, just a few months ago there was demand for tomatoes as there was less supply. The price of tomatoes had reached D90 per kg. It was then that farmers started growing tomoatoes thinking there would be good price in the market. Tomatoes need three months to grow. There was good rain, that added as an advantage to them. There is good supply and price has naturally come down, he said. In summer, with some virus or the other, the yield of tomatoes will come down, and the price of tomatoes will increase during that time."

However, the night temperature this season has mostly hovered around 7 degrees Celsius, four degrees above normal, while the day temperature has come close to 20 degrees Celsius.The region, extending from Kashmir to Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, has witnessed no snow in the last three months. Rainfall, on the other hand, has been up to 100% deficient. As apples are a rain or snow-fed crop, this development has caused much concern among cultivators.A dry apple farm in Himachal Pradesh. (HT File Photo)The planting of apple saplings  which is usually done when the soil is rich with moisture  have been delayed, and the infusion of fertilisers in the soil has been poor. For the first time in 20 years, we did not witness any rain or snow through December and January. So far, the region has seen only 300 chilling hours, bemoaned Balwant Chauhan, an apple grower from Rohru.Prem Chandra Sharma, a 68-year-old farmer from Hatal Sainj village in Uttarakhand, also predicted difficult times ahead.According to experts, the warm winter may also impact the production of other crops  including pears, apricots, green almonds, tomatoes, cabbage and cauliflower. Such weather conditions will hit apple production adversely as Himachals orchards depend completely on rainfall. Moisture is a must for cultivation of fruits, said horticulturist SP Bhardwaj.Apple economicsApple constitutes 90% of the fruit crop in Himachal and Kashmir, and is the main source of livelihood for people from seven out of 12 districts in Himachal and nine out of 14 districts in Kashmir.Himachal witnessed a record production of 892 metric tonnes of apples in 2010-11, but plummeted to 275 metric tonnes the very next year. Ever since, it has shown no sign of recovering.Kashmir also witnessed a drop in production in recent years with overall temperatures rising across the Himalayan region.The dry weather may also impact rabi crop cultivation in the hills. The drought-like situation is likely to hit wheat production, said Himachal Pradesh agriculture department director Dr Des Raj Sharma.Meanwhile, the governments of these states are looking at alternative measures to alleviate the situation. JC Sharma, principal secretary of the Himachal Pradesh horticulture department, said the government was trying to make up for the lack of rainfall by setting up irrigation infrastructure and root stock plantations under a World Bank project.Uttarakhand agriculture minister Subodh Uniyal, on the other hand, said the state government will prepare a report on losses incurred by farmers on the basis of district-level inputs.Other sectorsThe absence of snowfall has affected tourism in the region too, with visitors staying away from their winter hotspots.We have no choice but to wait for the snow to rev up the season, complained Nishant Sharma, a Himachal-based tours and travel operator.Manali Hoteliers Association president Gajender Thakur had a similar tale of woe to relate. Many tourists cancelled their bookings after they realised there would be no snowfall in the coming week, he said.The situation wasnt much better in neighbouring Uttarakhand either. The international winter skiing championship, scheduled to be held at Auli from January 16, has been deferred by a month.Met forecastThe India Meteorological Department (IMD), however, has promised rainfall and snow from January 22.Global warming may be giving rise to warmer winters, but regional factors like western disturbances and the El Nino also impact temperatures, said IMD (Delhi) official DS Pai.Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist at the Skymet Weather Services, said this winter was warmer due to lack of active western disturbances that cause snowfall. The western disturbances that impacted the Himalayas this time were not strong enough to cause precipitation in the northern states. However, they did disrupt the flow of cold northwesterly winds, making temperatures in the Indo-Gangetic plain plummet, he said.Twelve of the 15 warmest years recorded in India occurred between 2001 and 2016, in keeping with global weather patterns."

An elaborate plan will soon be chalked out.The Parishad came up with those suggestions at a seminar held in Dehradun on Wednesday. Officials present at the seminar shared a number of success stories relating to their initiatives in areas such as water conservation and in generating self employment that paved way for reverse migration. The officials represented a number of departments like agriculture, horticulture, tourism, watershed and Khadi Udyog.Officials were asked to present reports about those success stories at the next seminar to be organised at HNB Garhwal (Central) University on January 28. All those programmes will be followed up and replicated elsewhere in the state, Maharaj said. The Parishad will share with officials its initiatives that helped to check forced migration.Referring to the watershed development department, he said a water conservative project at Hatal village in Chakrata had led to reverse migration. Water scarcity in that village forced some 17 families to migrate. They all have returned now as water is available for irrigation of fields, Maharaj said.The minister attributed the turnaround to the ponds that were dug in Hatal and its surrounding areas for rainwater harvesting. Locals have earned Rs 6 crore by selling tomatoes and cauliflowers that they grow in plenty.Steps would be initiated to promote agriculture tourism to check migration. We plan to organise fairs like ginger fair, pomegranate fair, apple fair to attract tourists. The fairs will be organised by horticulturists and farmers in areas where they get bumper crops.Besides, the tourism department would boost income of the people in rural areas by promoting programmes such as eco-tourism and home stay facilities. It will help attract foreign tourists to rural areas in the state.

They not only participate in these religious fairs but also contribute towards development of their ancestral villages.He said the government agreed to promote such programmes because migration is a major problem facing the state.

An elaborate plan will soon be chalked out.The Parishad came up with those suggestions at a seminar held in Dehradun on Wednesday. Officials present at the seminar shared a number of success stories relating to their initiatives in areas such as water conservation and in generating self employment that paved way for reverse migration. The officials represented a number of departments like agriculture, horticulture, tourism, watershed and Khadi Udyog.Officials were asked to present reports about those success stories at the next seminar to be organised at HNB Garhwal (Central) University on January 28. All those programmes will be followed up and replicated elsewhere in the state, Maharaj said. The Parishad will share with officials its initiatives that helped to check forced migration.Referring to the watershed development department, he said a water conservative project at Hatal village in Chakrata had led to reverse migration. Water scarcity in that village forced some 17 families to migrate. They all have returned now as water is available for irrigation of fields, Maharaj said.The minister attributed the turnaround to the ponds that were dug in Hatal and its surrounding areas for rainwater harvesting. Locals have earned Rs 6 crore by selling tomatoes and cauliflowers that they grow in plenty.Steps would be initiated to promote agriculture tourism to check migration. We plan to organise fairs like ginger fair, pomegranate fair, apple fair to attract tourists. The fairs will be organised by horticulturists and farmers in areas where they get bumper crops.Besides, the tourism department would boost income of the people in rural areas by promoting programmes such as eco-tourism and home stay facilities. It will help attract foreign tourists to rural areas in the state. Similarly, programmes like Mera Gaon, Mera Teerth which the Parishad has been organising to pave the way for reverse migration would be replicated elsewhere.Parishad general secretary Ramprasad Penuli said a large number of the people from Pahari diaspora who left their villages long ago for various reasons have started participating in Gramotsava.

This is because the state government hasnt fixed any rates for vegetables, Narayana Gowda, one of the farmers in Kolar district, said.Since there is no minimum support price (MSP) for food grains and crops, the pricing of fruits and vegetables is left to the market forces.Narayana Gowda, who is from Hosmatanahalli in Kolar district, said, over `70,000 is spent to grow vegetables in an acre. The cost includes pesticides and other agro-based expenses. We grow and take care of it for three months day and night. But in return, we get pittance. The middlemen are rampant.Now that the supply is more than the demand in the market, the middlemen are purchasing tomato, beans and brinjal for `3 each (per kg), capcicum for `15 and ladies finger for `5 (per kg). We are not getting any profit. Whatever we are getting we are spending it on transporation and also for the coolies at our farms. The coriander leaves are sold at `10 per bundle. One can imagine our plight. Where should we go? he asked.Srinivasa, another farmer demanded that farmers flea market be held at every panchayath or hobli level once a week or fortnight. At least we can go sell our products directly to the consumers, and get some profit. We can also avoid the middlemen, he said.Chennagowda, a farmer who grows tomatoes in Kolar, said tomato price came down to `4 per kilo to `3 a few days ago. In fact, it even went down to `2 last month. We put in a lot of effort to grow it for 100 days, but this is what we get. Every political party leader comes to us before elections with assurances, but nothing is done. If we do not get money, how can we take care of our wives and children,  he said."

Photo: Samar HalarnkarI am a storehouse of what my wife calls useless information. I get withering looks when I tell her which B- or C-lister is dating, whos getting married, what their workouts are and where they vacationed this winter. She has no interest in the fact that the svelte actor who rules the Kannada film industry is, like her, a Sindhi. Shes Galrani, youre Ramani, and you both do yoga, I tell herbut she has already left the room.Oh well.You see, in this breathless era of the smartphone and Twitter, I read five local newspapers, which is where I glean these nuggets. I read the pages that the few people still reading newspapers immediately discardthe city and lifestyle sections. Dominated by lurid gossip and paid-for puff publicity, these pages often have realalbeit badly writtenlocal news.Thats how I knewwhile reading the Deccan Herald city section at the doctorsthat the annual avarebele mela was on, a street-food festival based on a single bean, the avarekai, avarekalu or avarebele, Kannada words for the hyacinth or field bean.Bengaluru is known for its festivals celebrating agricultural products. These fairs offer relaxed markets where farmers, traders and city slickers mingle. We have an annual kadalekai parishe, or peanut fair, and last week, while running through the citys sprawling Cubbon Park, I dodged enthusiasts thronging a millets fair and millets marathonthe agriculture minister, whose trim frame betrays a proclivity to fitness, enthusiastically participated in the latter.My wife, who always persuades me to patronize the local Ramzan and Christmas festivitieswhich she can appreciate through only sight and soundhas always wanted to indulge her own culinary tastes, which are vegetarian and appreciative of local farmers and traditions. The problem is the bean and peanut festivals are across town, and given my reluctance to engage with Bengalurus formidable traffic, we had not been there.One bright winter morning, I bundled her into an autorickshaw and off we went to Sajjan Rao Circle in VV Puram, where old traditions, homes and trees linger. This is a vegetarian Kannadiga stronghold, and that is evident in the meat-free offerings on thindi beedi, or food street, a 100m stretch of carts, small eateries and condiment stores. One of these, Sri Vasavi Condiments, organizes the annual avarebele mela that focuses entirely on a green-and-white broad bean, made with skin or without. The bean is particularly appropriate for a city that is often called bean town in the English translation from one of its supposed root names, bende kaal ooru, or town/village of boiled beans (although this is likely bunkum).Everything at the fair was about the avare bean, and nothing was costlier than Rs60. The avarebele was mixed with dosa, idli and bonda batters; worked into curries, ragi and rice rotis; blended with pulaos, upmas, payasams and evengreenhoney jalebis. Oh, how could I forget the union of north and south, the avarebele rumali roti, and, of course, that pinnacle of fusion, avarebele manchurian. I daresay no other festival boasts of the wild experimentation of the green bean soire, although I refused to experiment with the last two. We jostled around the coupon issuers, grabbed our precious tokens and waved them frantically at the chefs until we got, on leaf plates, our avarebele dosa with hithkabeleor beans without skinsaru (curry), avarebele ragi roti and avarebele idlis. We packed avarebele chikki, spiced hithkabele snacks and raw beans and plunged into the midday traffic to make our way back home.The next day, I cooked the beans and tossed them with some sea salt, hoping to create my own avarebele entre. The first thing I did was to integrate them with our daily dosa, as you can see in the recipe below. I think the Sri Vasavi Condiments dosa was made from beans with the skinavarelebe dosa, while mine was hithkabele, without the skin.I was happy to have finally made the long-pending journey to the mela. The avarebele has been a gap in my acquaintance with state tradition; about 90% of the southern crop comes from Karnataka. I have eaten the basic curry now and then, but I was not acquainted with the beans diverse uses. The avarebele is nutritious, packed as it is with vitamins and iron, and it is a particularly important source of protein for vegetarians. In Bengaluru, even those who dont eat iteven in my homeapparently know of the great, green bean.After we returned home the day of the fair, I was telling my pork-eating seven-year-old of our trip and how we had eaten all manner of delicious food made with green-and-white beans; you know, I told her, the same beans we sometimes pick up from Cubbon Park when we go cycling. Oh, she said, you mean avarekai.Hithkabele DosaMakes 4IngredientsBatter to make four dosas1 cup of peeled hyacinth beans (hithkabele)2 tbsp onion, chopped1/2 green chilli, chopped finely1 tbsp coriander, chopped finely1 tbsp tomato, chopped finelySea salt to taste1/2 tsp gheeMethodPlace the beans in a pressure-cooker steamer with water below.

Being a Bengali, food is forms an integral part of my life. I was never a ghar ka khana person, but always a bahar ka khana! she laughs. After a decade in corporate, she decided to don a chef s cap. She missed international cuisine when she got back home. So, I would Google recipes, hunt for ingredients across the city or sometimes go to Delhi to get it! I loved throwing parties, and cook food! I enjoyed the whole process of planning the menu and cooking, she says. But eating at the famous Massana Restaurant a Michelin starred restaurant in Girona, Spain, sealed the deal.That food made such a huge impact on me  the presentation, hospitality, taste  it was like nothing Ive ever experienced anywhere else, she gushes. She decided that she wanted to create such a memorable impact on other people. She visited the kitchens of a chef she knew at the Country Inn and Sweets and learned to chop, shred, and other nuances for the next four months. The first time, I walked in with my kitchen knife, the whole kitchen laughed! she recalls. That was the first time she chopped with a large cleaver, and she had to chop small pieces of garlic. After that, she did several culinary courses in French cooking, a duck master class in Australia and catering for private events. And when she got back to India, she received a casting call for MasterChef India! It was out of the blue, I cant believe I went to the Top 30! she recalls, and though she was heartbroken that she didnt continue, she trained under world-class chefs like Ornella De Felice, celebrity chef from Top Chef Italy and head chef at the restaurant Coromandel. Youre 36, and had everything but suddenly youre starting afresh! But I have no complaints. I loved that experience so much! I have an excellent family in Rome  I can get a couch there anytime I go! she laughs.According to her, fine dining is not necessarily cooking with truffles and caviar or decorating with a beetroot or carrot rose, but is all about techniques and simple ingredients that are seasonal and local, which she says is healthier and tastier. You get fresh stuff from local vegetable vendors she advises. Though she is trained in Italian, Mediterranean and Spanish cuisines, she calls herself an ingredient based cook. Even for this pop-up, we are using local ingredients like baby potatoes, fresh tomatoes  the menu also has a kulfi and rasmalai inspired pannacotta!. Each plate is designed to have flavours from different cuisines  a deconstructed salad has French, Chinese and Italian elements. Anuroopa is excited to be back in Chennai. I did my class 8 here, and lived in Adyar opposite the Adyar Bakery! she laughs. She has fond memories of eating at the Chola Sheraton, Mysorepak and murukkus from Grand Sweets.I love Chettinad food...I dont know why the world doesnt know about it yet. Indian food is not just butter chicken, you know! Does she dream of owning a restaurant? Of course, eventually. Right now I want to learn from the best, she concedes, adding that she is looking forward to doing more pop-ups around the country, while working in the best kitchens across the world. Later next month, I will be interning at one of the worlds Top 10 restaurants. People would die to get an opportunity there! People exit the kitchen at my age, and here I am entering one of the best in the world! she laughs."

This graduate of National Institute of Fashion Technology moved to Bengaluru after marriage and worked as a brand consultant for some of the top companies.Urban life, family responsibilities, job and the culture of small apartments made it impossible for her to employ her gardening skills effectively and, as a result, she could grow only a few herbs in her balcony.Forty four-year-old Anamika had always dreamt of having her own garden, where she could grow varieties of fruits and vegetables too along with her herbs. Then, one day, she was shaken when her daughter told her innocently that she thought fruits and vegetables came from supermarkets.This disconnect motivated Anamika to open a start-up called Village Story, through which she organises experiential farming for children and their families. Her friend offered her an acre of land to run this.Within six months, Anamika succeeded in growing vegetables and herbs such as zucchini, broccoli, edamame, cucumber, lettuce, cherry tomatoes, okra, eggplant, beans, born, rocket leaves, spinach, fenugreek, coriander, mint, carrot, millet, butternut squash, radish and capsicum.Anamika says that her father-in-law, who owns a nursery, farmland and orchard in Dehradun, is her inspiration.She shares about her startup: Almost now 15 to 20 families are part of our Farmville/Kitchen Garden; they are extremely thrilled that they have their own green patch where they can grow their own greens. They love coming here with family and friends. They sow, grow, harvest, taste and share. They feel its an amazing outdoor family activity for them, from where they take home an experience and joy of growing their own food.

An Australian delegation visited the governments centre of excellence at Bassi in Jaipur district recently to study the prospects of introducing the technique in the state.Soon, the Australian government will send a formal proposal for sharing this technique with Rajasthan, after which the work will start, said Prabu Lal Saini, the state agriculture minister.Hydroponics is a method to grow plants without soil, using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent.The three-member delegation, including South Australian governments investment manager (Indian trade) Rahul Ranjan and Australian firm Ironwoods chief consultant Mark Cody, studied the site and infrastructure at the centre for two days beginning January 11.Saini said that hydroponics technique would be used in the farming of tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, cucumber (kheera) and coloured capsicum. The farming of these vegetables will be done in 4,000 square metre area in Bassi. Use of the technique would increase the yields manyfolds, he said.Generally, yield per plant of tomato in three months is around half a kg and when grown in poly house the yield increases to 5-6kg per plant in six months, but through the hydroponics technique, the yield per plant will increase to around 65-70kg per plant in 10 months. Similarly, yield of coloured capsicum and cucumber is around 4kg per plant, which will increase by six times to 24kg per plant, he informed. Such innovations will help in doubling the income of farmers, he added.The crop will be grown vertically to accommodate more plants in the same area, thus increasing the yield. More production of vegetables will help in curbing hike in prices and common man can get quality vegetables at affordable prices, he said.Once it is started at Bassi, hydroponics will be propagated to farmers in the state, he said. Even during these two years of pilot move, an Indian version of hydroponics technique will be developed so that farmers can afford it, he added.The agriculture department has sanctioned 13 crore for the two-year project starting from June this year. Saini said the department has constituted a committee to speed up the project. The project will be supervised by Rajasthan Olive Cultivation Limited (ROCL)."

(Source: Thinkstock images) Representative Image. (Source: Thinkstock images)They say bigger is better, but in the succulent world of cherry tomatoes, one Israeli company is going smaller than ever before. The drop tomato is about the size of a blueberry and the Kedma company in the countrys southern Arava desert says it is the smallest one ever cultivated in Israel, perhaps even in the world, reports news agency AP. Its a point of pride in a country known for its agricultural innovation, where fruits and vegetables are taken seriously and where several strands of the cherry tomato were first invented.The idea is that it is comfortable, said Ariel Kidron, a Kedma grower. You can throw it in a salad, you dont need to cut it. It just explodes in your mouth. The seed, originally developed in Holland, was modified to match the arid growing conditions in southern Israel. Rami Golan, of the Central and Northern Arava Research and Development center, who accompanied the project, said it was definitely the smallest ever to be grown in Israel where tomatoes are incredibly popular.The tiny tomato, smaller than a one shekel Israeli coin, is offered in red and yellow varieties and will be presented to the public at a three-day international agricultural fair in Israel later this month. Early indications are it could be a big hit. Shaul Ben Aderet, a well-known Israeli chef who owns three restaurants, including Tel Avivs Blue Rooster, got some early samples and says the new strand is packed with flavor and will spawn an infinite number of new recipes. He offered it sizzled in a pan, baked into focaccia bread and as a straight-up snack.Its very simple, its clean, its nice, its sexy, he said. In a blind taste test alongside two sweets, he said, they would say the tomato is a candy, thats for sure.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Of the 99 major and medium irrigation projects identified for completion by 2019 through the LTIF, not more than 10 have been completed so far.The year 2017 has been a great one for the BJP, politically. Under the leadership of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, the party has scaled new heights by wresting Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Manipur, retaining Goa and Gujarat, and luring Bihar into its fold. The only minor setback was Punjab, where the Akalis and BJP lost. The party now rules in 19 states, either on its own or as a dominant partner of the NDA. More than two-thirds of Indians live in these states and this is, perhaps, the best opportunity for the Modi government to carry out agriculture reforms in a synchronised manner, at least in these 19 states. Remember, agriculture is a state subject in the Constitution, and this sector has remained somewhat neglected in the reform process since 1991. This is PM Modis moment. If he can reform agriculture, he can not only distinguish the NDAs policies from UPA-type reforms, but also establish himself as a leader of the masses. This will pay handsome dividends in 2019.It is not a secret any more that farmers have suffered during the last three-and-a-half years of the Modi government, first from two successive droughts and then from tumbling agri-prices. In the first four years of the Modi government, agri-GDP is going to register an average annual growth rate of around 2 per cent, which is almost half of what was achieved during the 10 years of UPA rule. So, without lifting its performance, and the incomes of farmers, it will not be feasible to achieve either sabka sath, sabka vikas or doubling farmers incomes by 2022, as has been promised by the prime minister.As one looks back at 2017 with an agri-lens, one finds it a puzzling and painful year for farmers. The monsoon was reasonably good, and so was kharif production. Still, several states saw farmers agitations triggered primarily by very low prices for their produce, be it onions, potatoes, pulses, oilseeds or cotton. The profitability of major kharif crops for major producing states, based on market prices and projected costs estimated by the CACP, has gone down dramatically to less than 5 per cent or negative in kharif 2017 (see graph). This has to be measured against the promise of 50 per cent profit over costs, as mentioned in the BJPs 2014 poll manifesto.The worst, however, happened in Madhya Pradesh, where the farmers agitation became violent and many farmers died in the ensuing police firing. This led to a knee-jerk reaction in policies, from farm loan waivers in many states to a drastic increase in import duties on pulses and edible oils.Earlier, the Union budget for 2017-18 had also announced several measures for farmers. For example, the augmentation of the Long Term Irrigation Fund (LTIF) with NABARD by Rs 20,000 crore taking its total to Rs 40,000 crore; the micro-irrigation fund of Rs 5,000 crore, and the dairy development fund of Rs 8,000 crore, all with NABARD. A model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2017, was also circulated later. But what has been the progress so far? Very little. Of the 99 major and medium irrigation projects identified for completion by 2019 through the LTIF, not more than 10 have been completed so far and that too many without field channels. The micro-irrigation fund has not taken off yet, and the dairy fund was approved just a few days ago. No wonder, with such a lacklustre performance, one cannot expect much improvement in agriculture or farmers incomes.Now, under duress, MP is undergoing a pilot price deficiency payment scheme under which the difference between MSP and modal prices of eight notified commodities is to be paid directly to farmers. The jury is still out on the projects performance but at this stage it is clear that it suppressed market prices further, especially of urad, creating a crisis for urad farmers.In case of trade policy, the government seems to have finally woken up to dovetail it with MSP policy and, accordingly, raised import duties significantly on pulses and edible oils ensuring that the landed prices of these are not below their respective MSPs. Better late than never!What can be done now as one treads into 2018?First, expedite the implementation of major flagship programmes by removing glitches, especially in crop insurance (PMFBY), irrigation (LTIF and micro-irrigation), and the dairy development fund. Second, ensure an effective monitoring and dovetailing of agri-trade and tariff policy with MSP policy through a sub-committee of the Cabinet to take quick decisions. Third, give high priority to agri-marketing reforms to create a seamless movement of agri-produce all over India. Dont hesitate to admit, and correct, the fact that so far e-NAM has not delivered and will not do so unless the basics of agri-marketing from assaying, grading, storage, to dispute settlement are put on track. A major impetus needs to be given to link farmer producer organisations (FPOs) to agri-markets through Operation Veggies TOP (tomatoes, onions and potatoes) on the lines of Operation Flood in milk, linking FPOs to processors and organised retailers, bypassing the mandi system. NABARD has more than 2,000 FPOs and SFAC has created about 700 FPOs. A beginning can be made with them. With experience, this model can be scaled up to other fruit and vegetables.If the Modi government can do this, it can certainly improve farmers economic condition, who in turn will also reward the BJP in 2019. This is good economics and good politics, something PM Modi can sense well.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The strike later gained steam as thousands of farmers from across the state joined it.Various farmers groups from the state, which had played a crucial role in the strike last year, have decided to stay away from the nation-wide farmers strike that is scheduled to start on June 1. The strike has been called by the All India Kisan Sabha. Shivkumar Sharma, convenor of the Sabha, has asked farmers to ensure that supply of milk and fresh produce to 40 major cities are disrupted as that, he said, will force the government to accept their demands.The farmers demands include proper implementation of the M S Swaminathan Committees recommendations as well as a complete loan waiver.However, days before the strike, farmers groups from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune have declared that they will not participate in the strike. Deepak Bhise, president of the Junnar District Tomato Growers Association, said such strikes cause even more financial losses to farmers. Last year, farmers had incurred heavy losses due to the strike, which was sabotaged by some so-called leaders we do not wish to repeat our losses, he said.ALSO READ | High procurement of crop means little to farmers: Yogendra YadavMost farmers in Maharashtra were waiting for the monsoon to begin their sowing operations, said Bhise.Hansraj Wadghule, a leader of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana from Nashik, said they will not participate in the strike. More than 3,000 cases were filed against farmers last year and they are yet to be withdrawn. We do not wish to involve farmers in this years strike, he said.During Shetkari Sampa, the seven-day strike last year, farmers had stopped supplying milk and vegetables to urban markets. However, within a day of the strike, a section of farmer leaders had tried to call it off after late-night talks with the government. Farmers from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune refused to call it off and eventually, the government agreed to the demands of the farmers and announced a Rs 30,000-crore loan waiver.The genesis of the strike was in Puntamba village, in Rahata taluka of Ahmednagar, where villagers had passed a resolution in the Gram Sabha and called for a strike. The strike later gained steam as thousands of farmers from across the state joined it.However, Puntamba sarpanch Dr Dhanajay Dhanvate said the village residents will not participate in this years strike.Undeterred by the many groups which are not participating in strike called by the All India Kisan Sabha, its organisers said they have received overwhelming response from farmers from across the length and breadth of the country. In Maharashtra, a section of the so-called farmer leaders have opposed the strike, but we are certain farmers will support it, said Sandeep Gidde, one of the organisers of the strike.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

This price is recovered from the farmers. At present, transport charges range between Rs 10 and 40 per kg, depending on the distance. This price is recovered from the farmers.As fuel prices rise by the day, experts have hinted that a similar upward trend is likely to be seen in the prices of everyday essentials. Prices of vegetables, which have remained steady throughout the summer, might see a 20-25 per cent rise if fuel price rise continues.At Pune and Pimpris wholesale markets, most of the vegetables have remained between the price range of Rs 10 and 40 per kg. A glut in production, as a result of almost 10 per cent increase in the area of production across the state, has resulted in the collapse of prices.Vegetables such as green peas, cauliflower, cabbage, carrot, et cetera are mostly trading in the range of Rs 10-15 per kg, which, traders said, is because of healthy arrivals. Tomato, in most wholesale markets, is trading at Rs 5-8 per kg, while in the retail markets the prices are about Rs 10-15 per kg. Onion prices, too, are at an all-time low, as a production glut has tilted the demand-supply ratio. However, as diesel prices are touching an all-time high, traders fear an imminent rise in the prices of vegetables.Vilas Bhujbal, president of the Traders and Commission Agents Association of Punes Gultekdi market, said the transporters have not taken the decision to increase prices as they were hopeful of a quick correction in the prices. However, if the present trend continues, a sharp increase in prices is likely, he said. Transporters act as a conduit between farmers and wholesale markets like Pune, to ferry perishable commodities like vegetables. Normally, these are village-level entrepreneurs who charge farmers per crate or per kg to transport their ware. For a market like Pune, transporters bring produce from neighbouring districts as well as from states like Karnataka, Kerala etc.At present, transport charges range between Rs 10 and 40 per kg, depending on the distance. This price is recovered from the farmers. Bhujbal said if fuel prices continue to rise, the transport charges may increase by 10-15 per cent immediately. This will effect the prices in the wholesale markets and, subsequently, the retail customer will get vegetables at a higher rate, he said. However, many growers said transporters have already effected a rise at their end.Deepak Bhise, president of the Tomato Growers Association of Junnar taluka in Pune district, said wholesale prices have but collapsed. As farmers, we have to use diesel for our tractors, our machines run on diesel. So, this is pinching us hard, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Express Photo By Partha Paul Prices had skyrocketed after July last year as supply was severely hit in the face of low availability of the produce. Express Photo By Partha PaulTomato growers are reeling from heavy losses, hit by low exports and higher produce as the vegetable is cultivated on more areas than before.Tomato exports slumped in 2017-18 with India recording exports worth only Rs 107.21 crore compared to Rs 548.15 crore in 2016-17. Exports to Pakistan and Bangladesh, major destinations for Indian tomatoes, were especially hit. Last year, just about Rs 34 lakh worth of tomatoes were exported to Pakistan compared to Rs 368.45 crore in 2016-17. Exports to Bangladesh last year were just Rs 4.8 crore compared to Rs 66.69 crore in 2016-17.Political tension between India and Pakistan led to the suspension of exports via land to Pakistan last year. Exports to Bangladesh were hit after it increased the import duty on agricultural products to an whopping 48 per cent. In Maharashtra, Junnar taluka and neighbouring areas in Pune district are the major growers of rabi tomato, which feeds the markets from March till August. After that, tomatoes from Niphad, Satana and other areas in Nashik district feed the market and stay till around February.Prices had skyrocketed after July last year as supply was severely hit in the face of low availability of the produce. Farmers in Junnar had stopped using fertilisers and insecticides after March due to lower realisations. The wholesale market at Narayangaon in Junnar and at Pimpalgaon in Nashik are the major tomato markets for rabi and karif crops respectively.This year, Junnar farmers had failed to recover their expenses as till about late May they had to sell the vegetable at Rs 2-3 per kg. Traders had blamed the suspension of trade with Pakistan and Bangladesh for the bloodbath in the wholesale markets. Besides, instead of the customary 30,000 acres of plantation, this year Junnar and its neighbouring area had seen tomato cultivation on over 40,000 acres.The spectre of low prices looms large even as the state stares at another bumper cultivation for the kharif crop.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Instead, they convert it into manure for a terrace garden.The residents of Matoshree Pearl, a 22-storey building with 65 flats, have been treating their collective biodegradable kitchen waste within the society premises using two bio-composter tumblers with a capacity of 10 kg each that produce nutrient-rich manure.The society generates 30kg wet waste per day, and since October 2 last year when they began the project, residents estimate that they have helped the municipal corporation avoid the transport of 6,300kg of kitchen waste to the dumping grounds. That waste has instead been used to produce 800kg of manure.Considering we are not a very large society and we do not fall under the specifications of the waste management rules to treat waste at source, we have still ended up doing it, as our vision is to be a green society and ensure we give something back to nature, said Satish Kini, managing committee member and resident in-charge of various green efforts at the society. In a city like Mumbai, which is facing both air and water pollution, we want to make our society a green haven for our children and senior citizens.Additionally, the society has diverted 2,200 kg of their dry waste since October from going to the landfills by segregating it and recycling. Only biomedical and non-recyclable waste is being collected by the civic body.In August last year, the residents reached out to Are you Reducing, Reusing, Recycling- RUR Greenlife, a social environment organisation, responsible for many similar projects across the city. After a series of workshops by the organisation, the residents began their decentralized and sustainable waste management within two months.Matroshree Pearl is an inspiring model green society, which has active enthusiastic participation by all residents towards care for the environment. It gives us hope for a greener future, said Monisha Narke, founder and CEO, RUR Greenlife.The society adopted a three-bin approach to segregation of biodegradable; dry recyclable and non-recyclable waste by using colour-coded bins and garbage bags to ensure higher level of segregation. The dry waste is further segregated through a seven bin approach into - cardboard, paper, plastic bottles, electronic waste, metal, glass, and tetrapak cartons. Residents sell some of the reusable dry waste to rag pickers and other recyclers for a nominal fee. The revenue generated from dry waste recycling is used to support the kitchen waste management project which making the activity a self-sufficient project, said Kini.November onward, the 4,000sqft terrace of the building was made home to an organic garden where residents grow spinach, cucumber, tomatoes, chili, ladyfinger, fenugreek, lemon grass and many other vegetables. Children from the society have been given a vegetable patch each and they are responsible for nurturing them.We have set up a drip irrigation system which uniformly provides water to each of these plantations, said Shireesh Kedare, resident and professor, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B).This is one society which has made best use of the circular economy model and benefitted the most out of it. More than helping to ease the burden from landfills, this model makes a society self-sufficient. Our focus currently is to inculcate this attitude in more societies, which will give them incentive to adopt waste management at source, said Chandrakant Tambe, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporations solid waste management department."

Of the 125 lakh tonnes of wheat procured in the state during the current season so far, 65 lakh tonnes are being stored in the open.In technical terms, it is called covered at plinths (CAP) storage, which is a great cause of concern for the state government. The wheat stored in open is exposed to the vagaries of weather, and has shorter life. But what makes it worse are the piling up stocks of grains.There are 25 lakh tonnes of wheat of the previous season and officials in the Food Corporation of India (FCI), the central body that runs nationwide public distribution system, say the state will have a backlog of wheat of one full season (at least 125 lakh tonnes), hinting at tougher days ahead for the states food and civil supplies department.Besides, some more wheat of the current season is expected to arrive in the mandis. The state godowns also have 100 lakh tonnes of rice.Must read | Tomato prices crash in Punjab, Haryana due to bulk suppliesState procurement agencies have witnessed the second highest arrival of wheat this year after 2012-13 when 130 lakh tonnes of wheat was procured. Officials of state food agencies said such a pile-up in the CAP storage was not witnessed for the past five years.Another worrying factor is the fall in the monthly movement of foodgrains (wheat and rice) from the state, from an average of 18 lakh tonnes in the previous year (2016-17) to 15 lakh tonnes in the (2017-18) current year.Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are no longer consumer states and they have become self-sufficient in foodgrains. Also, Madhya Pradesh is now contributing to the national pool, said an FCI official, on the condition of anonymity.Besides, Haryana is expected to contribute additional 10 lakh tonned of foodgrains into national kitty this year (a total of 85 lakh tonnes as against 75 lakh tonnes in the previous year), which will cut down the demand for Punjab wheat, he added.Punjab has a covered storage space (godowns) capacity of 152 lakh tonnes for both rice and wheat, and 4.75 lakh tonne capacity in steel silos for wheat storage. This entire space is already full, according to officials.We are prevailing upon the FCI to make movement of foodgrains faster. If the quality of grains gets affected due to CAP storage, Punjab will be at a loss, said state principal secretary, food and civil supplies, KAP Sinha.The FCI official suggested that the state could easily store 30 lakh tonnes of freshly procured wheat in CAP storage to save covered storage space, as it would cut infrastructure cost to one-third.30 lakh tonnes of wheat kept from April to September in CAP storage would move out easily, he said."

Im talking about the intricate web of lanes running from the square opposite the Venetian Gothic-styled David Sassoon library behind Rampart Row all the way to Flora Fountain on one end and Horniman Circle at the other.For what its worth, Kala Ghoda was always a hub for culture and art. Flanked by a museum, many art galleries, a foreign cultural mission, a historical synagogue and erstwhile home to two of Mumbais iconic restaurants. Samovar, tucked inside the Jehangir art gallery, and Wayside Inn, wrapped around the corner next to Rhythm House.Wayside Inn was epochal because it was at Table No 4 that Babasaheb Ambedkar, over hours of passionate persuasions and pots of tea, drafted the Indian Constitution. Its here that struggling progressive artists Husain, Ara and Gaitonde scrounged for toast and eggs, and poets like Arun Kolatkar wrote verses about life, jam and bread. Here that Mohammed Ali Jinnah romanced his Parsi girlfriend over dhansak, and Behram Contractor created his memorable humour column alongside sunny-side-up eggs and bacon. And where a whole generation of post-Independence socialists and intellectuals was bred, over custard and bread pudding.Rampart Row used to be a street full of happening restaurants. All the fun is now inside the lanes. (HT File Photo)I used to love sitting there, watching the rain fall and the brown trees go green, over a mug of beer and plate of mixed grill and onions.Rampart Row used to be a street full of happening restaurants. Wayside Inn has given way to Punjab Grill. Khyber looks a bit lost. Copper Chimney has shifted three buildings to the left, and right above it is Boston Butt. But all the fun is now inside the lanes.It all started with Kala Ghoda Caf. From a small sky-lit space that could seat, at the most, six people and offered free wi-fi, its turned into one of the most influential eateries in that precinct. Its cavernous hall and Bombay black wood furniture are reminiscent of a large dining room in an old Mumbai mansion.At The Pantry, ingredients come from artisanal makers all over India. The Quiche Lorraine they do with oodles of cream Gruyere alone is worth the visit. (HT File Photo)The menu is eclectic. Fourteen types of coffee, from macchiato to affogato. Ten kinds of egg, from the Parsi tamota par eedu (eggs on tomato) to omelettes with bacon and feta. There are also three kinds of waffles, two kinds of porridge and muesli. Its an ideal breakfast place. But lunch isnt bad either. You can pick between sandwiches, soups and sali boti, or try the Karnataka black rice risotto with mushrooms.Just off Ropewalk Lane is The Pantry. White, bright and cheerful, they source their ingredients from artisanal makers all over India. Their cheese for example comes from Pondicherry and the Quiche Lorraine they do with oodles of cream Gruyere and ham alone is worth the visit.La Folie is a stylish patisserie. The tiny place looks like a chocolate box itself, with small desserts lined up like little works of art, but its the hot chocolate that takes me there.At Ayub's, the meat is better, the onions fresher, the chutney less watery. To me, its the Michelin star version of Bade Miyan. (HT File Photo)Then theres Nutcracker, a vegetarian place thats cracked the code. Penne, pesto, panini, potato wedges, with peach and ginger iced tea. But the Emmenthal scrambled eggs with truffle oil, and the Mumbai Local sandwich hit the spot for me.A little further away is Plenty. Its not exactly Kala Ghoda, but a short walk towards Horniman Circle. Brick-walled and poignantly coloured, the menu is a mixed bag of all our favourite dishes that remarkably bear an overall demeanour of goodness and health. Even the usually oily, spicy and vinegary Goa sausage, when served alongside a portion of fresh avocado, pickled beetroot and goats cheese on a crisp slice of healthy toast, tastes wonderfully refined here.They have cold bowls and they have hot bowls and the hot bowl I like is the Kerala pepper chicken stew with steamed rice. But my favourite is the pulled pork sandwich  sweet and spicy pork between freshly baked bread. The finale has to be the berry pavlova, meringues in sour berry compote with vanilla cream, lime and pistachio.Watch out for Maska Maarke by Kunal Vijayakar in Hindustan Times, Mumbai, and on hindustantimes.com/mumbai, every Saturday morning.As the office rush recedes and the lanes empty out, as young couples walk hand in hand in the lanes of Kala Ghoda looking for love, and as revelers hunt for a wine, a beer and a song, I am often spotted looking for a hot spicy egg roll, stuffed with boti kebab. Walk past the aqua-coloured Knesset Eliyahoo Synagogue and at the end of VB Gandhi Marg (VB Gandhi is the man who decided that Mumbai cabs should be black and yellow) burns a late night fire. And that fire is from Ayubs.Ayubs the Michelin star version of Bade Miyan. The meat is better, the onions fresher, the chutney less watery and the rolls less soggy. Hot seekh kebab or boti kebab rolls in soft roomali roti, with crunchy onions and chutney. Thats Kala Ghoda for me as well.But the weather right now is too muggy and oppressive to eat hot spicy rolls. Ill wait for the rain to come and wash the streets and trees of Kala Ghoda, because at the moment SoBos Soho stands for So Bloody Hot."

5b13bc499855b76246379fb1,Under pressure,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/under-pressure/article22548146.ece,2018-01-29,,The Hindu,"Amid files, printers and books stands a little pressure cooker. Beside it, theres a bowl of raw chicken. And, in the centre, towering over an induction cooktop set on an office table, stands B Ramakrishnan aka Ramki, who  as always  is in the eye of a storm, and loving it.His enemy du jour is the Instant Pot (IP). A recent story in The New Yorker celebrated Urvashi Pitre, a Dallas-based food blogger, who posted an IP butter chicken recipe, that required 10 minutes of cooking time and got 41,600 shares. The recipe reportedly prompted NRIs to throw out their pressure cookers and replace them with sleeker, programmable IPs.However, in India, Ramki is leading a crusade of his own, encouraging Indians to cook with pressure cookers, using a trademarked technique he calls OPOS (One Pot One Shot.) The community, connected by social media, consists of a Facebook group called OPOS school with more than 13,300 active members and a marginally more relaxed OPOS support group with about 15,500 members.As belligerent as he is bright, Ramki attacked the IP recipe head on, calling on the community to collaborate and create a quicker, easier version with the pressure cooker. They responded with enthusiasm: firing up stoves from Chennai to Dallas. Eleven experiments and four days later, hes cooking up the final six-minute OPOS version in a little office space in Parrys corner, Chennai. He marinates half a kilo of chicken with one spoon each of Kashmiri chilli powder, ginger-garlic paste, dry fenugreek etc. Then, he pours precisely 60 ml of water into a 2-litre pressure cooker, and layers 1/4 cup butter, 1 tsp sugar, chicken and scooped-out tomatoes filled with two tablespoons of almond powder on top. It cooks for six minutes and eight whistles, after which he adds cream and butter.The resulting butter chicken is astonishingly creamy. More importantly, its perfectly cooked. The pressure cooker is faster, greener, lasts a lifetime, costs peanuts to fix and can survive multiple falls, he says, adding wryly, OPOS butter chicken is cooked in the time it takes an instant pot to heat up.An MBA in Marketing and Finance from XLRI in Jamshedpur, Ramki is a restless entrepreneur, constantly on the lookout for the next big idea. More than 10 years ago, he came up with One Page Cookbooks, which broke recipes into building blocks. He started Pizza Republic. But OPOS is clearly his favourite project, even though after eight years of relentless experimentation, he is yet to use it to make money. I feel it would be wrong to keep this information to myself, he says, adding OPOS is constantly shaped by the feedback of thousands of volunteers from over 20 countries.Years ago, the method kicked off so many arguments on a Facebook Food Group that it resulted in Ramki and about 100 other people being kicked out: Much to his delight. I started a group called United By Food, about five years ago. Thats when the experimentation began. We began fine-tuning recipes, burning our way through dishes and blowing up safety valves on a daily basis.One part water becomes 1600 parts of steam when heated. So you need just half a teaspoon of water to cook this, he says, pointing at a cup of beans. If your water dries up, your safety valve might blow. If you put in too much water, theres a build up of steam. The biggest fear is burning, not bursting, he adds, explaining why people should not be afraid of their pressure cookers. It is virtually impossible to blow up. I have been trying to do that for ages. Unsuccessfully!With this system, food is cut and layered according to cooking times and density. Watery veggies at the bottom. Starchy on top so they dont burn. Length doesnt matter: only thickness. Recipes and cooking time are standardised, and newbies are firmly told to stick to the rules. The key is to cook food in its own juices. In the highest possible heat for the lowest possible time.This enables users to put together elaborate meals unbelievably quickly. Six minutes. Thats how long it takes to cook myself lunch. My mother used to take half a day, says Ramki. Of course, there has been the inevitable push back. Chefs and traditionalists tend to be cynical, often resulting in heated online wars. Its hard to have a rational discussion. Either people love me or hate me. A pressure cooker cult? He laughs. I kind of think that is true. It has become a cult. Probably because of my personality...He says his confidence stems from babies. When people started posting that their babies loved OPOS food we knew we were on to something. Baby senses are very acute... Good food is hard-wired into us. He continues, This technique will change food. It will become the only way people cook. It will change every cuisine. Every cookbook.Overly quixotic? Not if you listen to his legion of admirers, who address him as Chef or Sir, and breathlessly follow his every update. Many are housewives once forced to spend hours in the kitchen to please picky in-laws, husbands and children. They talk of OPOS changing their lives by unchaining them from the stove.As for the tough moderators and inflexible rules? OPOS comes with a built-in punishment, Ramki chuckles. The more you veer away from the recipe, the more scrubbing there will be in the end.Deadly much?People used to be afraid to eat tomatoes, thinking them poisonous due to their relation to the belladonna or (deadly nightshade) plant."
5b13c10b9855b762ecebf1a5,How does your garden grow?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/how-does-your-garden-grow/article22547340.ece,2018-01-29,,The Hindu,"Having a little patch of green has always been important for Bengaluru-based Anjali Chalisgaonkar. I grew up in small-town India and my mother is a gardening enthusiast. So, weve always had gardens, she says.When she set up her own house, she decided to carry forward that gardening tradition, starting with a few pots on the balcony and soon expanding. The pleasure of growing plants is tremendous, she says, admitting that working in her garden gives her a sense of well-being and happiness.She isnt the only one. A 2016 meta-analysis of research conducted by the NCBI concludes that there is, robust evidence for the positive effects of gardening, and that it can, improve physical, psychological, and social health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US, adds that, Gardening can be a great way to enjoy the outdoors, get physical activity, beautify the community, and grow nutritious fruits and vegetables. This is what our team of experts has to say.Plants relax a person, says Kolkata-based psychologist, Mansi Poddar.Which is why, perhaps, there is a specific treatment programme called eco-therapy, that aims to improve mental and physical well-being through a range of outdoor activities, including gardening. It gives people who are depressed a sense of purpose and meaning, says Poddar, pointing out that since it is an activity with an outcome, it makes people feel a sense of achievement and improves their self-esteem. It can also be a great outlet for negative emotions, improves attention and focus, calms an overactive nervous system and helps people who find contact with the world difficult, establish safer and gentler transition into the world, says Poddar.It is also great at relationship building and emotional intelligence. Gardening taps into the part of us that nurtures. And having that sense of warmth and comfort reduces stress, says Poddar. By becoming a community activity that fosters a sense of belonging, it becomes especially useful for older people who often struggle with loneliness. However, it is equally beneficial for children, since it encourages a sense of responsibility and inculcates environmental consciousness. Also, it is also a spiritual activity. I see many people using gardening as a metaphor for life.Gardening helps you stay limber. says Gurugram-based functional fitness and rehab specialist, Vani Pahwa.Its especially important as you age and develop conditions like arthritis and muscular degradation, she says. A spot of light gardening  think weeding, digging, mulching  can help you perform movements like squatting and balancing, naturally. Of course, this is dependent on other factors, including age, body-weight, gender and intensity, but the fact is, any movement counts, says Pahwa, adding that keeping active is especially important for people who dont train regularly.Even seasoned athletes can benefit, of course, by adding in a few sessions of gardening. Constantly performing at a high intensity is detrimental to health, says Pahwa. More importantly, however, gardening helps you connect to nature. You become part and parcel of a life-cycle that gives you emotional satisfaction. This brings in a separate dimension to health, she says.The quality of food grown at home is always superior, says Delhi-based Lovneet Batra, a sports nutritionist. Better water, home-made compost, no lab-made fertilisers, ensure that food grown at home is more flavourful and nutritious. Besides, the less the food has to travel, the less is its carbon footprint. So what could be better than heading out into your balcony to pick up fresh palak, tomatoes or mint?Batra, who herself grows many of her own vegetables, says that easy access to seeds and superior systems like hydroponics, make it very convenient to grow much of your own produce.There is definitely a shift with more people growing their own food, says Batra, adding that this is especially useful for food eaten raw, like salad or cold-pressed juice.Commercial vegetables and fruits are often full of pesticides or injected with chemicals, she says, pointing out that there have been cases of people falling sick after consuming them."

Now they get quality power for eight hours a day with a capital investment of just Rs. 50,000 per unit thanks to the government subsidy of Rs. 4.50 lakh. They also need not go to their farms in the dead of the night as was the practice earlier, say a group of enterprising farmers from Bobbepalli village, tucked away from the Chennai-Kolkata highway.'There is no marketing problem for these vegetables as they have longer shelf life and better freshness, they say in a conversation with The Hindu .The farmers from the village have tied up with traders in the Koyambedu wholesale market in Chennai to market the hybrid vegetables, including carrot, beetroot and onions, tomato grown with the help of solar-powered pumpsets through a network of micro-irrigation system to grow more crop for every drop of water with water soluble fertilizers.On harvesting, we send the vegetables to Chennai, 350 km away and payments are credited online to our bank account on delivery, says a happy farmer D. Srinivasa Rao as he monitors his 30-acre farm on his CCTV.They sell the vegetables locally when prices are almost the same in the Martur market, from where they are marketed by wholesale traders in different parts of the country, adds another farmer J. Haribabu.D. Anjaneyulu, a product of a Business school in Visakhapatnam, has taken to farming as his profession at a time when his peers shied from agriculture in view of the uncertain returns.The returns are very much encouraging. But one has to toil and also do a smart work as well, says the young farmer who has installed a high-value shade net for ensuring ideal agro-climatic condition for improved productivity. They have also adopted water conservation techniques to retain every drop of rain water, adds yet another farmer J. Bullaiah."

The team members also visited the the tomato fields in Ramasamudram, Madanapalle, Nimmanapalle and Palamaner mandals.Peter Hanson, a U.S.-based lead tomato breeder, who headed the team, was accompanied by Agriculture Market Yard (Madanapalle) chairman Ratakonda Gurappa Naidu, translating the versions of farmers for the team on the field. WVC project coordinator, Srikanth Babu, and Scientific Officer J. Karthik recorded the version of tomato growers.Mr. Hanson said the Madanapalle variety was amazing with high quality. I appeal to the farmers of this region to go in for dual purpose tomato breeds intended for both processing industries and domestic needs. Though there is much demand for the processing varieties in India and abroad, the production levels are not encouraging. The World Vegetable Center will play a crucial role in guiding the farmers here in the direction of raising dual purpose crops. This will be quite economical and also profitable, he said, adding the experiments to this extent were giving encouraging results at the labs set up in the four mandals. Soon, the fruits of labs will reach the lands, Mr. Hanson said.Mr. Gurappa Naidu said the World Vegetable Center had been actively involved in raising dual purpose tomato varieties after thorough research into the soil and climatic conditions of the region. He said it was a welcome sign that the horticulture scientists had noted that the Madanapalle variety with a stamina to withstand temperatures as high as 45 degrees C could be developed and promoted as a premier crop, with global recognition."
5b13c89a9855b762ecebf660,Pencils that sprout,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/pencils-that-sprout/article22487973.ece,2018-01-22,,The Hindu,"Did you know over 2,500 wooden pencils can be created from a single tree? And to produce the 15-20 billion pencils needed every year, four lakh trees are cut. Troubled by these alarming statistics, software engineer Divya Shetty, along with friend, Vishnu Vardhan, launched Plantcil in October 2017.Their biodegradable pencils, made with recycled paper and edible food colours, come in many variants: rainbow, velvet, cartoon, seed, and the latest, fruit pencil, was launched last month. We make pencils without cutting down trees, and use only waste newsprint. We have saved 28 trees in the last three months, says Shetty.If you think their pencils are made abroad or shipped from up north, you will be pleasantly surprised to know they are crafted a lot closer to home. At their manufacturing plant at Avinashi (40 kms from Coimbatore), that employs 100 people, over a tonne of waste paper is brought in every month. We make 6,000 pencils a day. There is zero wastage as whatever waste is generated gets recycled and goes back into the production cycle, says Vardhan.All things organicHailing from an agricultural family in Karnataka, Shetty explains why she quit a career in IT to helm two social enterprises. When I was eight, my grandfather committed suicide due to crop failure. I was affected by this incident and always wanted to do something for our farming community, says the 27-year-old, who was working with Vardhan at an IT firm in Bengaluru two years ago.It was in 2015 that she finally decided to make the switch, and launched Indian Superheroes, a social enterprise aimed at introducing people to organic and zero-waste farming, and the rent-a-farm concept  along with Vardhan.For the first two years, they worked on getting farmers together, and convincing them to make the switch to organic. We brought in 12 NGOs and self-help groups who taught them the benefits of organic farming and how to market their products, says Vardhan. In 2017, they launched an online portal, indianorganic.store: they tied-up with over 800 farmers who could sell their produce directly to consumers.Fruity flavoursDuring her interactions with farmers, Shetty says, she learnt that deforestation is the primary reason we are facing a water crisis today, and how the water-intensive pencil industry plays a huge role in this. Thats when we decided to make sustainable pencils inspired by all things natural, she says. They kick-started Plantcil in a rather innovative way. Rather than source paper from scarp dealers, they started collecting old newspapers from schools in the city and, in turn, provided them with a monthly supply of pencils. We realised that by approaching schools, children are introduced to sustainable living early on, says Vardhan.As the concept of plantable stationery began a few years ago with independent Indian and Chinese brands, Shetty and Vardhan constantly brainstorm for fresh ideas and work closely with their design team. Once provided with a basic sketch for a pencil, the team works on the specific size and shape.The classic pencils have Indian ethnic prints on them and the seed pencils have plant seeds at their non-writing tip. We procure native seeds like chilli, spinach, beans, tomatoes and brinjal directly from farmers. Students can plant the pencil and water it. In a few days, a new plant sprouts to life from it, says Shetty. The rainbow pencils are unique as the shavings are multicoloured and ideal for craft. An attempt at teaching children about the colours and aromas of fruits, their latest range of fruit pencils come in different flavours: pineapple, orange, green apple, cocoa, mixed fruit and pista. We source fruits directly from farmers in the region and the extracts give the pencils their aroma. They are made-to-order as the extraction process takes a week and the extracts cannot be stored for too long, she says.Up nextThey are now working on seed pens, all set to launch shortly. Costing Rs. 7 each, at present the nib and refill is made with plastic, with a cardboard body. They are now researching on how to make it a 100% eco-friendly pen using recycled paper.Plans are also in place to launch an app, Farm Zeal, next month. It is aimed at educating people about organic farming. We will be putting up announcements for workshops and gardening activities for children. There will also be an option for people to rent a portion of land to implement what they learn, says Shetty, who believes there is a growing market for all things organic and is looking at retailing her pencils in Maharashtra, Bengaluru and Chennai.The pencils can also be customised with a companys name, and start at Rs. 6 a piece. Available at Sapna Book House, RS Puram in Coimbatore, Nilgiris supermarket in Puducherry, and online at plantcil.com.Deforestation is the primary reason we are facing a water crisis today, and the water-intensive pencil industry plays a huge role in thi"
5b13ce969855b762ecebf9b3,In Odisha  schools are the dropouts,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/in-odisha-schools-are-the-dropouts/article22476577.ece,2018-01-20,,The Hindu,"Doors closed:In contrast to the government schools in villages, which have been running short of students, many of the residential schools are overcrowded. Shadin Menaka (sitting), a physically challenged tribal student, dropped out after the Sana Raisingh primary school closed down.Biswaranjan RoutBiswaranjan RoutIts a little past four in the afternoon, the time when schools ring their closing bells in the Hatsesikhal cluster of Odishas tribal-dominated Rayagada district. Just before Sekhal Primary School comes into view, a couple of students in blue uniforms cycle past on the concrete road that cuts through palm tree cultivations and paddy fields.Along the highway that connects the area to the district headquarters 15 km away are rows and rows of eucalyptus trees that feed JK Paper Mills manufacturing unit in the district.This particular school has been running since 1926. In 1987, it became a 40-seat residential school. As we enter the premises, students are busy sweeping the yard and classrooms. Some are watering the grounds with mugs filled from a large drum placed near a row of dysfunctional toilets.Hobsons choiceAt 81, the number of enrolled children is double the sanctioned strength. All the students in its hostel belong to the villages located in the four or five Gram Panchayats in the area. The schools apparent popularity is not due to its exceptional facilities. For most students, the fact that there are three teachers in this school, and they get three meals a day, makes up for the visible lack of infrastructure: three overcrowded classrooms for five classes, no dining hall or toilets, and a small row of damaged and abandoned rooms gaping at them dismally. But how could they possibly complain? The alternative  to stay on in their village schools  is far worse, and in any case about to disappear.Hostel superintendent Rabindra Kumar Majhi allows two Class 4 students, Santha Mandagi and Siddhanta Melaka, to accompany us to Ranaguda village, which is just a few kilometres away but not easy to access because of the Nagavali, one of southern Odishas major rivers that originates in Kalahandi district and flows into neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.As we wade gingerly across to the other bank, we realise we would be lost without the boys. Ranaguda is a 35-household Kondh tribe hamlet a couple of kilometres from the river. It has a primary school, but one with just two students. The teachers recently informed the villagers that the school will be closed down due to poor enrolment.RTE betrayedIn 2016-17, as many as 828 government primary and upper primary schools were shut down in Odisha for having less than 10 students each. Its less than a decade since the Indian government displayed some political will to achieve the goal of universal and equitable education by passing the Right to Education Act. But the failure, in practically all the States, of hundreds of government-run neighbourhood schools to even stay open betrays a lack of seriousness in implementing the RTE.In Odisha, the Ranaguda case is hardly the first instance of the State governments inability, and all too often, lack of will, to retain primary students in its neighbourhood schools. In 2014, 195 schools in the State with less than five students were served show-cause notices.In tribal areas like Rayagada and Kandhamal, which also have pockets subject to Maoist influence, the government seems to wilfully favour young children studying in residential schools, cut off from their families. Ostensibly, this is being done to make educational facilities available to those living in remote and conflict-ridden areas. The government even has special programmes to help children who missed out on early education, so that they can be mainstreamed into regular schools. But the fact remains that Ranaguda is 15-20 km away from the district headquarters, and the only reason the children here end up going to residential schools is that the local one doesnt function.This past year, the highest number of free government schools struck off the list, 124, is in the economically backward, though mineral-rich Rayagada district, followed by Kandhamal, which has lost 101 schools.The idea was to merge these erstwhile schools with a primary school located within a kilometres distance or an upper primary school within 3 km. The state would provide transport facilities or an escort if the distance is above the prescribed limit or the terrain difficult. According to Binodini Panda, district project coordinator, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan, another 268 such schools have already been identified for closure in Rayagada, and are awaiting formal approval.Earlier this month, a circular issued by the OPEPA (Odisha Primary Education Programme Authority) to all district project coordinators appeared to provide some relief, as it stated that geographical barriers are valid grounds to consider re-opening schools. But Panda clarifies that so far as re-opening goes, there are no schools under consideration in Rayagada.The Ranaguda villagers, for their part, have appealed to the CRCC (Cluster Resource Centre Coordinator) to reverse the decision. About ten students will be ready to join primary school from the Anganwadi centre next year, they say. But even if the administration agrees, the reason for the low student strength is likely to continue.Gathered together outside one of the pucca houses built under the Indira Awaas Yojana scheme, the parents say that the two teachers hardly ever make the trek here and had last come two days before this reporters visit. Even the Anganwadi worker has been refusing to come here, they say. Complaints to the CRCC have proved futile. In frustration, the residents have been pulling the children out of the village school and sending them away to the nearest hostel schools for adivasi children.The majority of these kids are first generation students. Most of the Kui-speaking women in the village are also non-conversant in Odia, the medium of instruction in the schools. But the will to ensure at least elementary education to their children is high. The basic requirement, which they rightly demand, is the regular presence of teachers.Biju Kolaka is a student of Class 10. He is one of the few older students who continue to live in this village of small farmers, who grow vegetables like tomato, brinjal and chilli. He crosses the river on foot every day to reach school in Jemadeipentho. During the monsoon, when the river swells, it takes Kolaka an hour on bicycle to cross the bridge 10 km away and get to his school. Kolakas elder brother, though, has been sent to study at a residential high school in Rayagada city.The distrust of the education department is palpable. Even though staff strength is low, not in a single government school that we visited were all the appointed teachers present. The teachers in school had their attention divided between students of two or three classes, all sitting together in the same room. Sending students to residential schools is not uncommon here.Increasing cultural alienationThe preference for hostel schools is not from the parents side alone; it is a strategic decision on the part of the State in this fully Scheduled area with a low literacy rate. According to the 2011 Census, the rate of literacy among the Scheduled Tribes (STs) in Odisha was 52.24% against the overall literacy rate of 72.87%.Among the communities living here, dependent mainly on agriculture for their livelihood, the SC & ST Development Department of Odisha states that improving educational facilities through residential institutions has been an identified thrust area.There are different categories of free schools it runs, from high schools to ashram schools for elementary education, sevashrams for primary education, and educational complexes for particularly vulnerable tribal groups. Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya, a central government initiative, focusses on girl students from the SC, ST and OBC groups. Then there are institutions such as the Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences, a private residential school in Bhubaneswar, which claims to provide free education to 27,000 ST children within its 80-acre campus, and has plans to open more such schools in 20 districts of Odisha.Social activists have expressed concerns that this strategy has been increasing a sense of cultural alienation among the students. They are forgetting their family culture and imbibing alien values. A child from a residential school is unable to cope with her village circumstances; he or she looks at it with disdain, has a sense of inferiority, and is always looking for a way out, says Vidhya Das, from the NGO Agragamee that works in 10 districts of Odisha.The current policy is similar to the setting up of residential schools for aboriginal children in Australia and Canada that started in the late 19th century, with assimilation the stated reason. The physical and emotional abuse faced by children removed from their homes, the denial of their cultural heritage and history, their subsequent demands for reparation, as well as the Canadian governments apology for the hardships they faced, are well documented.With the aim of ensuring that tribal children get their education in local schools, Agragamee has provided additional teachers conversant with the Kui language in 18 government primary schools in Rayagada district. They say that this has increased attendance. The education department also runs a similar programme of multilingual education. And yet, the emphasis on residential schools has gained momentum. Anasthesia Kerketa, assistant district education officer, points out that aside from 40 and 100-seat schools, there are now 500-seat ones too.Flourishing private schoolsIn contrast to the government schools in villages, which have been running short of students, many of these residential schools are overcrowded. Gorakhpur High School, an ashram school in Kashipur block of Rayagada, has 1,050 students, of which 220 girls and 473 boys are in residence. The 15 teachers in residence here are well below the mandated student-pupil ratio. We end up admitting so many students due to political pressure, says the headmaster Pitambar Bhoi.Even as the government promotes residential schools, it has been unable to address the main issues that are driving students out of the government schools in their own locality: teacher shortage and teacher motivation.The primary school in Sana Raisingh village in Rayagada block closed a year ago. It used to have a single teacher who would come for just an hour a day, say the villagers. They have already petitioned the collector to reopen the school.When this school closed, the existing students dispersed, some to the closest government school, many to a private school in the neighbourhood. But three physically challenged ST children were left behind. Unable to walk properly, Shadin Menaka, Nimak Raja and Diksha Kolaka dropped out.Opposite the closed school in this 30-household village is a neat row of newly constructed toilets under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan programme. The hamlet includes both Kondh tribals as well as Telugu families belonging to the general category. Some of the latter started sending their children to a private, English-medium convent school in nearby Jimidipeta, which charges annual fees starting from Rs. 3,000. Unlike the nearest government school, the private school sends a vehicle for the children. Theres a bypass road here, with trucks going to Vishakapatnam. So we dont want our children to walk to school. But if the local government school were to reopen, all the students would come back here, says Virata Jagdishwari, who has two daughters studying at the private school.Similar trendsThis is by no means an Odisha story alone. State governments across the country are preparing the ground for the mushrooming of low-cost private schools. According to several media reports, Maharashtra has identified 4,093 schools for closure. Andhra Pradesh, which closed 9,000 schools last year, was one of the first States to experiment with public-private partnership in school education. Rajasthan, which merged as many as 17,000 schools in 2014, will adopt the same policy from the next academic session.Minimum RTE norms are not being achieved in government schools, from maintaining the student-teacher ratio to infrastructure to providing a support system for teachers. With the quality of education dropping, children have been leaving for private schools, says Ambarish Rai, national convenor, RTE Forum.This is clearly the case in the Humma Gram Panchayat area of Odishas Ganjam district, which is also Chief Minister Naveen Patnaiks home turf.In 2013, Ganjam was badly affected by Cyclone Phailin. The cyclone shelters and rehabilitation houses in its rural areas alert one to the fact that this region is prone to natural disasters. The district, which has the highest proportion of SCs living in the state, closed down 70 primary and upper primary schools in 2016-17. District education officer Sanatan Panda says that the migration of skilled workers to Surat and other places has led to the drop in the student enrolment in many blocks. The proliferation of private schools is another reason.In Baunsiapada, a village of Dalit families that make bamboo products, a primary school opened in 2004. The village, situated close to a railway crossing and a busy highway, had to fight hard for it. But the school had a short life. Since 2015, it has been merged with the primary school in Gada Humma. According to the in-charge of the school, Lingaraj Mahankuda, only two of the nine students from Baunsiapada made it to Gada Humma.In 2013, when Mahankuda joined the Gada Humma school, it had 75 students. The number has since shrunk to 42. Educated people who can afford it send their children to private schools, he says. Prafulla Kumar Nayak, who was the president of the school management committee of the now-defunct Baunsiapada school, has enrolled his son at the nearby Sri Sai Saraswati Vidhya Mandir. He considers it a better option for his son.Started only in 2014, this private school presents a stark contrast to the pitiful number of students in the two classrooms at the Gada Humma government school. P. Ravindra Reddy, pradhan acharya of the school, and Suresh Chandra, secretary, put the total number of students at 519, with each paying Rs. 1,200-Rs. 1,800 annually.Run under the aegis of the RSS-backed Bharat Shiksha Vikash Sansthan, the classrooms of this institution turn into hostel rooms at night. Aluminium boxes containing the students belongings are pushed against the walls of the classrooms during the day.The State government has put its hands up, claiming to be overburdened. Of the 11 blocks of Rayagada, only four have block education officers, of whom Kerketa is in charge of two in addition to her duties as assistant director of education. Teachers, too, claim to be overworked.Battle to keep school openMahankuda of the Gada Humma school points out that apart from having to juggle several classes at the same time, they also have to be available for compulsory election duties, do survey work, and supervise mid-day meals and the distribution of iron tablets. Shiksha Sahayaks, or assistant teachers, also mention discriminatory pay scales as a reason for the low motivation level among government teachers.Simanchak Pani, a Shiksha Sahayak at Gabudi primary school in Subalaya panchayat, complains that though he has completed three years at his job, he will be regularised only after another three years. In the meantime, he must make do with Rs. 6,000 per month. How is it possible to remain motivated? he asks.About six months ago, the villagers of Gabudi made a forceful bid to stop the village primary school, which then had seven students, from being closed down. They decided that increasing the student numbers was the only way. Kailash Jena, a farmer, brought his son, Biswajit, back from Saraswati Shishu Mandir, and a few more children living with relatives elsewhere returned to the village. The school now has 11 students, and its future remains precarious unless the numbers increase.Several residents of the village (all of them non-SC/ST) have migrated to work in the Alang shipyards, and to seek employment as skilled workers in the textile and marble industries of Gujarat. As his neighbours laugh, Jena says that family planning has been their downfall so far as school enrolment numbers are concerned. An SC-ST village a kilometre down doesnt have that problem, he jokes, creating traffic jams on their road to school. Clearly, Gabudi village doesnt want its own primary school merged with that one.Minimum RTE norms are not being achieved in government schools, from maintaining the student-teacher ratio to infrastructure to providing a support system for teachers.Ambarish Rai,National convenor, RTE ForumA child from a residential school is unable to cope with their village circumstances, they look at it with disdain, have a sense of inferiority, and are always looking for a way out.Vidhya Das,NGO Agragamee"
5b13d1249855b762ecebfb23,Alive and kicking,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/alive-and-kicking/article22476939.ece,2018-01-20,,The Hindu,"A lively discussion on Facebook got me thinking about one of the nicest creations on earth  the club sandwich. A group of die-hard club sandwich lovers was discussing if the dish had disappeared from restaurants. Some even were writing an epitaph to the dish.I dont think the multi-layered sandwich has disappeared, but I do agree that they are not as popular as they used to be. I suppose todays restaurant-goers have a lot else to choose from.But as far as I am concerned, club sandwiches rule. And thats why, when we were sitting out on the terrace of a rooftop restaurant in Kathmandu, with a huge menu placed in front of us, I still opted for a plate of club sandwiches.The restaurant is called Mezze, and it is in a mall on Darbar Marg. It was a pleasantly sunny afternoon when we landed up there. The terrace is picturesque, and you can stand by the railing and see the bustling city. And you can eat your club sandwich as life goes by.The Super-Club Sandwich was rather nice.Perfect stuffingStacks of triangular slices were filled with all the stuff that you need in a sandwich  bacon, chicken, egg, lettuce and tomato. And, of course, you cant have this and not have French fries dipped in ketchup, topped with black pepper.My love affair with club sandwiches began some 40 years ago, when I had my first delicious bite at the Machan, the coffee shop at Taj Mansingh. The coffee shop at the erstwhile Kaniskha Hotel offered good club sandwiches, too.Later, it was my regular fare at Cellars, which became Parlour at some point of time. I have had them at the Calcutta Club in Kolkata, and in sundry little restaurants here and there. When people ask for their chicken stroganoff or roasted lamb in mint sauce or lobster thermidor, I go for the club sandwich. I think what makes it so special is that one bite gives you at once a melange of tastes and flavours  of pork, chicken, egg, veggies, and of course, the nice texture and smack of bread.Mezze offers you a lot more  from pizzas and pasta to pork chops and fried fish. We tried out the fried fish, which was crispy, with a well-browned crumbed shell.Succulent chopsThe pork chops were juicy and nicely fatty, and came with a buttery mound of mashed potatoes. And I could tell by grubby faces of the young pizza lovers that they were happy with their well-topped wedges.A foodie among us asked for the Yaki beef with scallions  which he loved  and someone else had a Panini Caprese  with mozzarella, tomato, basil and capers. And a youngster went back there the next day for some carbonara pasta  with bacon and cheese.We had a very pleasant young man called Bikram serving us  who took all our eccentricities and demands in stride and with a smile. And he told us, rather helpfully, that the restaurant has a branch in New Delhi  the Roadhouse Caf in Greater Kailash.So, I dont think club sandwich lovers need to despair. The dish may not be at the head of the table any more, but it is alive and kicking  and may it continue to do so. And let the tribe of club sandwich lovers increase."

Shuffling slowly on boxy black legs, Sophia made her walking debut in Las Vegas last week at the CES electronics trade show.Sophia seems friendly and engaging, despite the unnatural pauses and cadence in her speech.Her predecessors include an Albert Einstein, complete with bushy moustache and white thatch of hair, a robot named Alice whose grimaces run a gamut of emotions and one eerily resembling the late sci-fi author Philip K.

The robots can blink, smile and even crack jokes.Global market revenue for service robotics is forecast to grow from $3.7 billion in 2015 to $15 billion in 2020, according to IHS Markit.That includes both professional and domestic machines like warehouse automatons, smart vacuums and fuzzy companion robots.For now, artificial intelligence is best at doing specific tasks.Its another thing entirely for machines to learn a new ability, generalise that knowledge and apply it in different contexts, partly because of the massive amount of computing power needed to process such information so quickly."

Over the last few weeks, across India the price of potatoes has fallen sharply after a year of bumper production. With the price of a kilogram of potato dropping as low as under a rupee in certain wholesale markets, many distressed farmers have left their produce to rot on the roads, and in cold storage facilities. Curiously, potato prices were many times higher just months ago amid scarce supply. Last year, the price of other produce like red chilli, tur dal and tomato witnessed a similar trend of steep falls compared to the previous season. The sharp swing in prices has been explained by the Cobweb phenomenon. Farmers tend to increase the production of certain crops in response to their high prices during the previous season, which in turn leads to a supply glut that causes prices to crash. The cycle repeats each passing year, with the lag between price and production causing a huge mismatch between supply and demand. The present fall in potato prices comes against the backdrop of a slowdown in the rural economy. According to advance GDP estimates released by the government last week, farm growth is expected to drop from 4.9% in 2016-17 to 2.1% in 2017-18.Given the humanitarian and political costs of agricultural distress, particularly in a year when many big States go to the polls, local governments could turn towards populism to satisfy their rural voter base. This could come in the form of fiscal measures such as farm loan waivers, a higher minimum support price for farm produce, or some combination of the two. The next Union budget may well be focussed on the rural economy through fiscal measures. Such relief measures that temporarily ease the pain on farmers, however, will fail to make a significant difference to their lives in the long run. Any permanent solution to the problem of agricultural distress will have to deal with the challenge of price fluctuations. The boom-and-bust cycle is the result of a broken supply chain that is over-regulated. In the absence of a robust market for buying and selling forward-looking contracts, farmers are left to fend for themselves against severe fluctuations. In addition, the domination of the wholesale market by cartels prevents farmers from receiving a fair price even when their produce is sold at much higher rates to consumers. The government must resolve to address these structural issues, and not limit itself to ad hoc policy measures in firefighting mode. There is a need to give farmers not just a better, but also more stable, return on their crops."

Some traders, who could not clear the arrivals, preferred to dump them as waste, which eventually was transported to Ariyamangalam dump yard on Wednesday.Traders attribute the slump in prices to heavy arrival of vegetables than the actual demand over the past few weeks. Besides the arrivals from Dindigul, Theni, Pollachi, Oddanchathiram, Kallupatty and Vaiyampatty, the market in Tiruchi continues to get excess loads of tomato from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh apparently due to heavy productivity.The prices of vegetables always rule low during winter season as it is conducive for vegetable cultivation.

A few days later, Gatto passed on the food baton to compatriot, Chef Gualtiero Marchesi from Villa San Michele, whose dishes are on the menu until February 11.Over glasses of cava, we try a tasting menu which begins with ricotta cheese stuffed in eggplant roll on a bed of delicious tomato concasse. Simple and reliant on local ingredients, the dish is a burst of flavours. The shrimp polenta comes on a bed of cornmeal, and gives us a taste of Italian seafood.Our main course is the risotto we cooked, while we find it a tad bit bland, a generous sprinkle of parmesan shavings does the trick. Our dessert, spumone alla grappa with bitter chocolate ice cream and raspberry sorbet is a let-down as it comes without any spumoni or three-layered gelato. The raspberry sorbet has been replaced by orange marmalade, which adds a tang to the bitter chocolate ice cream.In a conversation after the meal, Gattoo, who arrived in the city a day before our meal, says hes excited to visit the local markets. It is very important to cook with ingredients available locally. No point cooking with things got from all over the world, he tells us, explaining that the menu has been made with vegetarian dishes in mind. The beans here are excellent for pasta e fagioli soup and even the edible flowers are great.Breaking some myths, Gattoo laughs, There is no such thing as pink sauce. We have the mama rosa, but even that is not an authentic Italian dish. After the Second World War, Italy was a poor nation, and many chefs moved out for work. That is when the fusion started. Think pizza with pineapple! Today, you can put anything on a pizza. But food to me is nostalgia, the power of memory, he signs off, recommending his special dish of padava chicken from his hometown.

Kote and surrounding places, said Ramesh, a wholesale dealer. But with excess cultivation this year, the price of the crop has remained low for over a month, he added.For farmers, the cost of cultivating tomato on an acre of land is reckoned to be around Rs. 1 lakh, which includes daily wages of nearly Rs. 400 per head. Cultivators can hope to reap a net profit only if the market price is fixed at around Rs. 10 a kg. Otherwise, it will be a loss, said Mr. Ramesh, who however said that the situation was unlikely to improve for at least another month.The APMC yard in Mysuru receives 20-30 tonnes of tomatoes, the bulk of which is transported to Kerala. The hybrid variety of the produce comes from Hassan and Mandya while the demand from the local market is met with what is cultivated around the region.While seasonal variation in production and price fluctuation is the norm when it comes to agricultural produce, tomato farmers tend to be the worst affected as prices remain low for long as supply mostly outstrips the demand, according to wholesaler dealers at the APMC yard. This only benefits procurement agents and dealers.A few local farmers like Atiahalli Devaraja pointed out that prices pick up when the demand for tomatoes is fuelled by food-processing units involved in the manufacture of jams, pickles and the like. But in case there is a lull in demand or the units outsource the crop for a better rate from other places, then the local farmers are affected, and more so in the absence of refrigeration and storage facilities, he said."

A recent survey conducted by mobile health and fitness platform, HealthifyMe, confirmed as much, with the average consumption of fruit and vegetables decidedly less than the recommended five. Patna at 1.63 servings ate the most fruit, while Nagpur at 1.2 servings ate the least. Keralas reputation as a meat-centred population may not be unfounded, with both Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi eating only 1.45 servings and 1.57 servings of vegetables a day. The most recent National Family Health Survey, released by the Ministry of Health in 2016, confirms as much, with less than half (47%) of Indian women, consuming green, leafy vegetables on a regular basis.Your body needs both macronutrients and micronutrients to function effectively, says Bengaluru-based clinical nutritionist, Dr Anju Sood. Macronutrients, which, as the name suggests, are substances needed in large quantities, give your body energy to perform its essential functions and help the body grow and repair itself. Fats, carbohydrates and protein fall under this category. Then you have the micronutrients, substances that are important, but are needed in far less amounts. But they are needed for overall wellness, as they aid in metabolism regulation, enzyme and hormone production, enhance bone density and perform a whole lot of other tasks. These include your vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals. Eating plenty of fibre-rich fruits and vegetables is a great way to get in your micros, agrees Dr Sood. And, lets be honest, they do look pretty on your plate too. So, eat the rainbow, as they say. And heres how (and why) you do it.Red loveRed fruits and vegetables like watermelon and tomatoes are very rich in lycopene, a very powerful antioxidant, says Dr Sood. Since antioxidants help combat the effect of free radicals that cause cellular damage, they are believed to help prevent heart disease, ageing, and cancer. Also, many red foods contain beta-carotene, the precursor to Vitamin A, a very important fat-soluble vitamin that our body needs, adds Bengaluru-based nutritionist, Shalini Manglani Alwani. Vitamin A supports growth, vision and protects you from diseases, she says.Sunny goodnessThe subtle sweetness of pumpkin, the tang of citrus fruits like oranges, lemons and tangerines, the tropical goodness of jackfruit, papaya, mango or pineapple these dont just taste delicious, but they are extremely good for you. Yellow and orange fruits are again very rich in beta-carotene, says Dr Sood. That is why we tell children to eat a lot of carrots, she says. Citrus fruits, additionally, are powerhouses of vitamin C, which helps in collagen formation and aids natural healing, says Alwani. Gorgeous skin anyone? Eat lots of yellow.Supergreens are hereWonder why green juices and smoothies have been doing the rounds? We really dont get enough of them though. We should, says Alwani. It is rich in a variety of mircros, including, Vitamin A, beta-carotene, vitamin K and E, folic acid, vitamin C, calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and iron, she says.From bone and teeth health to aiding brain function, oxygen transportation and enzyme catalysis, greens are great for you. The green colour comes in because of chlorophyll, which has a strong antioxidant and anticancer effect, adds Dr Sood. So yes, your grandmother was right about the keerai.Purple powerBlueberries, eggplant, purple raisins and grapes, onions, beetroot and plums get their colour from a blue pigment called anthocyanin, says Dr Sood. Anthocyanin, a powerful antioxidant, has been linked to increased longevity, better brain health and reduces liver damage, among other things. They also contain resveratrol, a flavonoid antioxidant that protects the inner linings of your arteries.Eating plenty of fibre-rich fruits and vegetables is a great way to get in your micros"

Hence we dumped the produce in a public place, said Govindasamy, a farmer from Ayyalur.The farmers claimed that they dumped tomatoes on the road out of frustration as they could not get even what they expended on raising the crop.The government should have a mechanism to protect small and marginal farmers. If it had provided sufficient infrastructure to preserve perishable commodities like tomato, at least for three or five days, the markets would not witness huge arrivals all of a sudden.Meanwhile, some residents of Padma Nagar collected as much tomatoes as they could in bags.Many passers-by also took the vegetable to their homes.A woman said, I will have this (tomato) for the next four days. Some others said they would prepare juice and pickle since they had taken away close to five kg.The farmers had dumped a little over 500 kg on the road.Horticulture department officials said tomatoes were being cultivated in Vadamadurai, Ayyalur, Kottapatti, Reddiarchatram and other pockets in the district.With the markets witnessing huge arrivals, the prices of the vegetable have fallen to such low levels, the officials admitted."

The school authorities hit upon the idea of growing their own vegetables.Mr. Yacob, school headmaster, told The Hindu that since the parents of most of the children attending school are casual workers dependent on seasonal work, their children often go hungry.Variety of vegetablesThis also led to children falling sick and not being able to concentrate on their studies, he said.The vegetables raised in the garden include broccoli, cauliflower, three types of brinjal, cabbage, tomato, beans and greens, which are used in noon meals prepared for students. The children are much healthier and miss fewer school days, they claim.Right from the beginning, we made it a point to ensure that no chemical fertiliser or pesticides were used to grow the vegetables, said Mr. Mathew, who came up with the idea of cultivating organic vegetables.Not only do the vegetable patches ensure a year-long supply of fresh produce, they also teach the children the importance of farming, ecology and the environment, he said.Though we do not allow the children to do any of the work in growing the crops, some of the kids bring seeds from their homes and plant them. They have also learned to value nature, and do not destroy any of the ornamental plants grown on the school premises, he added."

Tomatoes are priced at a minimum of Rs. 6 per kg. Broad beans was priced the lowest of Rs. 3 per kg in the market until a couple of weeks ago and the cost has climbed to Rs. 10 a kg now.

In fact, some of my best friends are accountants. But all things considered, youll agree when I say that the world would be a much improved place without accountants.Anthropologists and evolutionary psychologists tell us that the human brain has not evolved to live in a society that includes Form 16. Just imagine if all the worlds accountants were to disappear through a wormhole into a parallel universe from where its impossible to come back. The immediate benefit would be no more income tax, which means no more running around to make last-minute tax-saving investments.Yes, I am aware its that time of the year when many of you, especially the salaried class, are racing to meet the deadline for submitting investment proofs to Accounts. Now that the good times are finally here and youre making tonnes of money, I know you are seeking the best avenues for converting your rapidly growing savings into insanely profitable investments.I am also aware that in the investment declaration form that you submitted last year, you had declared investments of Rs. 30 lakh from your Rs. 10 lakh salary so that they didnt accidentally deduct Rs. 40 lakh as income tax.But relax. Many years ago, I used to work at a personal finance suicide helpline for people who had lost all their savings to bad investments. So I do possess some expertise in money matters. This is an important life skill these days because even though things are going well  the GDP is booming, onions are affordable, and jobs are plentiful so long as youre not snobbish about selling pakodas  a handful of anti-nationals have made it almost impossible to find a safe investment.Real estate is out, unless you want to help debt-stricken developers offload their unsold inventory.

5b1423e49855b7624637d5b8,It’s time to reimagine South Asia,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/its-time-to-reimagine-south-asia/article22938048.ece,2018-03-06,,The Hindu,"A few months ago, Anjum Altaf, former dean of the prestigious Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), wrote an article in the Dawn newspaper, making a strong case for mutually beneficial economic cooperation between Pakistan and India. He also gave a revealing example of how this has become impossible because of blind nationalism in Pakistan.At the time, he wrote, when tomatoes were selling for Rs300 a kilo in Lahore, they were available at Indian Rs40 a kilo in Amritsar a mere 30 miles away. But a visceral Indo-phobia, shared by many of our influentials, stood in the way of consumers benefiting from the lower priced supply. Many Pakistani politicians want nothing to be imported from India, the enemy nation.This kind of blind nationalism is by no means Pakistans monopoly. Those who watch Indian TV channels debating India-Pakistan relations routinely hear similar Pak-phobia. Result: despite being neighbours, India and Pakistan are among the least integrated nations in the world. Because of their unending mutual hostility, South Asia too has become the least integrated region in the world. The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is in a coma. Sadly, the most populous region in the world has also remained home to the largest number of poor people in the world.So near, so farA few striking examples will show how our two countries, which were part of a single seamless socio-economic and cultural entity before 1947, have now completely drifted apart. There are no direct flights between their capitals  New Delhi and Islamabad. The frequency of Delhi-Lahore and Mumbai-Karachi flights have become minimal. The Mumbai-Karachi ferry service (the two port cities, once part of a single province, are closer to each other than either Mumbai and Delhi or Karachi and Islamabad) was stopped after the 1965 war.In this age of information revolution, the number of phone calls between Indian and Pakistani citizens (including calls between close relatives of divided families) is negligible, mostly out of fear of being questioned by their respective security agencies. At less than $3 billion annually, trade with Pakistan accounts for a meagre 0.4% of Indias growing global commerce.Those who are happy with this status quo have set responses. On the Indian side, it will be said that terror and trade cannot go together. The Narendra Modi government has raised the bar higher  terror and talks cannot go together. On the Pakistani side, resolution of the Kashmir issue has become a precondition for any substantial bilateral cooperation.But is the status quo benefiting either country? The answer is obvious, except to those arrogant ultra-nationalists who think India now has a seat on the global high table and hence need not care for Pakistan, and to those narrow-minded Pakistani patriots who think they need not care for India since they now have two protectors  China and the Muslim Ummah.China, of course, has become a new factor influencing Indias negative attitude towards Pakistan, both among policy-makers and the common people. Our Army chief, General Bipin Rawats egregious remark last year about India being ready for a simultaneous two-and-a-half front war with Pakistan and China (the half front being our own alienated people in Kashmir) has helped solidify an impression that our two large neighbours can never be friendly towards India. If Indias foreign and defence policies proceed on this belief, South Asia is surely heading towards a future of intensified hostilities and conflicts. Arms manufacturers and distant destabilisers will profit by this at the cost of common Indians and Pakistanis, who need employment, education, health care and food-and-environmental security. These needs can be met only through regional cooperation, not regional rivalry.China, part of the solutionIn other words, can China become a part of the solution, rather than being perceived as a part of the India-Pakistan problem? A three-way India-China-Pakistan cooperation is not only necessary but indeed possible, and Chinese President Xi Jinpings Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) provides a practical framework for such partnership. Unfortunately, Mr. Modi has allowed himself to be misled by his advisers on the BRI. The governments opposition to the BRI is based, among other things, on the myopic argument that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a flagship project under the BRI, violates Indias sovereignty since it passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).Not only does this argument hold no water but it also undermines Indias long-term development and security interests. First, CPEC does not recognise PoK to be Pakistans sovereign territory. Article VI in the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement clearly states in that after the settlement of the Kashmir dispute between Pakistan and India, the sovereign authority concerned will reopen negotiations with the Government of the Peoples Republic of China.... Second, there is little possibility of India ever getting PoK, or Pakistan ever getting the Indian side of Kashmir, through war or by any other means. Therefore, connectivity, cooperation and economic integration are the only realistic bases for any future India-Pakistan settlement of the Kashmir dispute.Third, and most important, both China and Pakistan have stated that they are open to India joining CPEC. China has also expressed its readiness to rename CPEC suitably to both address Indias concerns and to reflect the projects expanded regional scope. Already, Iran, Afghanistan and several Central Asian republics have agreed to join this ambitious regional connectivity project. Will it help or hurt India if it joins this renamed initiative as an equal partner? Will it not connect Lahore and Amritsar (also Delhi and the rest of India), the two sides of Kashmir (which all Kashmir-based political parties want), Sindh and southern Punjab with Gujarat and Rajasthan, and Karachi with Mumbai?Interdependence vitalA no less seminal benefit for India is that by joining the renamed CPEC, it would gain land access, through Pakistan, to Afghanistan, Iran, Central Asia and western China. And if our leaders show vision, ambition and resolve, the CPEC-plus-India can be linked to the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Corridor, thus creating a grand garland of connectivity and integration for the whole of South Asia. If 1947 divided our subcontinent, here is an opportunity for India, Pakistan and all other countries in the region to come together and rise in shared progress and prosperity.Regrettably, the same short-sighted advisers who have misled Mr. Modi on the BRI and CPEC are selling India the pipe dream of an alternative connectivity project by the Quadrilateral of the U.S., Japan, Australia and India. This is unlikely to take off. Even if it does, its developmental benefits to India will be limited since it will seek to keep China and Pakistan out. We are also told that India does not need the CPEC since it has already partnered with Iran in building the Chabahar port. Indias gains due to Chabahar are modest, and nowhere comparable to those that would accrue by India having a direct land access to Afghanistan through Pakistan, courtesy a renamed CPEC. The latter is also indispensable for the success of two other mega projects that are critical for Indias energy security and accelerated economic growth  the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) and Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipelines.Here is another huge potential gain for South Asia. The proposed connectivity initiative, which would create strong new bonds of regional cooperation and interdependence, could also help resolve three long-standing geopolitical problems in the region, in which countless people have been killed  terrorism, Kashmir and Afghanistan.To realise this vision of a resurgent South Asia, two obstacles will have to be removed blind nationalism and the unfriendly designs of extra-regional powers. As Karl Marx would have said: peoples of South Asia and China, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains; you have a bright new future to win.Sudheendra Kulkarni served in the Prime Ministers Office during Atal Bihari Vajpayees tenure"

She leads the Institute of Environmental and Sustainable Development.EducationKavita started off as a chemistry student at womens college at BHU named Mahila Mahavidyalaya (MMV). Years later, she would set up the first CIL  Central Instrumentation Laboratory here  a deck of necessary scientific instruments. But before she could do this, Kavita had to gather her scientific mettle. She did a Ph.D, also at BHU. Her research question involved a range of biochemical experiments. Following this were post doc stints in Japan and Switzerland. When she returned to India she took up lectureship in NEHU (North East Hill University) in Shillong. As an opportunity propped up, Kavita returned to Varanasi to teach at BHU. She brought her first PhD student with her from Shillong.ResearchKavitas scientific life now spans 24 years. After setting up the CIL in the womens college that is still in use, Kavita moved to the science faculty and then the IESD, of which she is now director. Kavitas scientific focus is on enzymes and how to make use of them. She won the Women Scientist Award 2011 from The Biotech Research Society for developing an enzyme-based sensor of the neurotransmitter dopamine. This sensor can monitor levels of dopamine in neurological patients to help administer proper dose of the drug to patients with Alzheimers/Parkinsons diseases. Kavita had found another novel application of this enzyme. Using nanotechnology, she has created a pollutant biosensor from this enzyme.Dye houses that exist in thousands in the saree-producing Varanasi area are small units using chemicals affluents. They discard the waste water directly in the soil after dying, but this water ultimately comes to their own tap water and drinking water or their agricultural land. It gets accumulated in the water table and then there is no way to remove it. To avoid such contamination we are preparing to give dyers the small instruments (bioreactors) at a very low cost so that the contaminated waste water can be treated. We have a prototype for testing it, she said.Additionally, with her students she is involved in mapping polluting sources of the Ganga including sewage and prolonged use as funeral sites that has led to silting. She also has methods to make transgenic tomatoes, genetic sequences of common root rot and protein models of enzymes that come from rice.The author is a science writer and part of The Life of Science project.

Parthasarathi told The Hindu that the crop colonies concept was being implemented on a pilot basis in Ibrahimpatnam-Manchal-Yacharam cluster in Rangareddy district this agriculture year (2017-18) on 5,000 acres with 2,000 farmers. They were supplied high-quality seedlings of tomato, brinjal and chilli raised in the Centre of Excellence at Jeedimetla here.Besides, the farmers were provided micro irrigation, subsidised seedlings, poly houses, pandals with an expenditure of Rs. 5 crore.Mr. Parthasarathi explained that the concept of crop colonies was basically aimed at ensuring self-sufficiency in agricultural produce, preventing market glut due to excess production of any crop and to make agriculture a remunerative activity based on the soil varieties, existing cropping patterns, consumption and production and providing marketing facility.As part of encouraging crop colonies around Hyderabad, it is also being planned to establish eight new markets along the Outer Ring Road and the Collectors of Rangareddy and Medchal have been requested to allot sites for the purpose so that godowns, including cold storages, could be constructed there.However, the issue of ensuring remunerative or at least support price to the produce in such crop colonies is still expected to be a major challenge to make the concept successful."

While the disease could be controlled with medication, many a time, there was little compliance of the regimen by patients.Over the past decade, the World Glaucoma Association has been conducting a worldwide drive to increase awareness about glaucoma. As there are few symptoms, patients do not realise its onset till the disease is far advanced.The theme of the drive by the World Glaucoma Association this year is: Prevent steroid-induced glaucoma.The use of steroids is rampant and many a time, it they are used as eye drops or tablets. Many patients are steroid-responders who end up with high intra-ocular pressure and glaucoma without any symptomatology till very late in the progress of the disease.On Sunday, the glaucoma awareness week was launched with many organisations joining hands to spread the message till March 17. As part of the programme, the Cochin Ophthalmic Club; Kerala Society of Ophthalmic Surgeons under the aegis of the Glaucoma Society of India, IMA, Kochi; Inner Wheel Club of Cochin; Rotary Club of Cochin; and Women Explorers joined the Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences in a walkathon held at Fort Kochi during the day."

The outgo on MSP and MIS was far higher than the previous governments Rs. 358 crore for 10 years, said Agriculture Minister Somireddi Chandramohan Reddy.The Minister was replying to an issue  MSP and market intervention scheme  raised by MLAs Y.Sambasiva Rao, D. Bala Veeranjaneya Swamy and Arimilli Radhakrishna under rule 344 in Assembly on Friday.The Minister said that the government procured maize, jowar, millets, black gram, green gram, red gram, bengal gram, black jaggery and turmeric under the MSP/MIS. The Central government would not declare the MSP for certain cash crops like turmeric, chillies and also products like black jaggery. On case to case basis, sometimes the Central government would sanction MIS but for fixed quantity. It created a lot of unrest among the farming community and avoidable negative publicity to the government. So, the government introduced price support scheme for red chillies and market intervention activity was taken up for onions and tomatoes to help the farmers, he said.The government had procured 5.44 lakh MT of agricultural commodities like maize, jowar and pulses. In addition, 55.57 lakh MT of paddy was procured from 2012-13 to 2016-17. The total paddy purchased under MSP was 39.54 lakh metric tonnes (LMTs). The paddy shifted for custom milling was 39.42 LMT, he said.Centres clarificationUnion Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, in the Budget 2018-19, stated that all notified crops under Kharif marketing season 2018-19 would be fixed at a minimum of 50% above cost of cultivation. It was later clarified that the cost to be considered for this calculation would be actual paid out cost plus value of family labour. So, the potential rise in MSP for paddy (common) would be 8% while it would be 5% for Grade A. The MSP for paddy had increased by 55% at Rs. 1,550 per quintal in 2017-18, he said.The Central government was fixing a lesser MSP than that suggested by the State government. For the year 2017-18, the State government suggested an MSP of Rs. 2,799 per quintal for paddy. The Centre, however, fixed Rs. 1550 for common variety. While Rs. 3,437 MSP was suggested for Grade A variety, the Centre pegged it at Rs. 1,590. The same was the case with other commodities like jowar, bajra, maize, ragi, and pulses, he added."

And now agricultural scientists have cautioned that these essential ingredients of salad are laced with harmful pesticide residues, which are radioactive in nature. The next time you order salad at a restaurant, make sure that the vegetables are thoroughly washed before they are sliced and served.Some of the kheera samples analysed as part of the all-India network project on pesticide residues by scientists from the city-based Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University contained high dose of dangerous chemical substances. Similar studies conducted earlier in Telangana revealed radioactive pesticide residues on tomato, chilli and cabbage too. Researchers blame indiscriminate use of chemical pesticides and fertilisers for the contamination.Two harmful radioactive substances, flubendiamide and deltamethrin, are present in several vegetable samples including kheera (cucumber), tomato, green chilli and cabbage. These substances are known to cause skin ailments, vomiting, diarrhoea, tremors, irrigation, low blood pressure and shock in case of severe exposure.They are known to create problems in pregnant women.According to experts, certain chemical pesticides and fertilisers contain radioactive substances that continue to stay on vegetables and fruits even after the harvest. The city agricultural scientists found the presence of flubendiamide and deltamethrin, which are radioactive in nature, on kheera. These harmful chemicals enter humans and animals when vegetables or fruits laced with them are consumed.A portion of these chemicals stay in the body and when the quantity reaches a certain level, they begin to show harmful effects, warn experts. Incidentally, flubendiamide and deltamethrin are prohibited in several countries while they are indiscriminately used in agricultural and horticultural fields in Telangana and other parts of the country.The results of the study were published in the latest issue of the scientific journal, Food Additives and Contaminants. The samples of kheera (cucumis sativus) were collected from Telangana and other states. They were analysed for persistence, dissipation and risk assessment of flubendiamide and deltamethrin. These chemicals are sprayed to control insects. Ironically, the chemicals act on the nervous system of insects. They are detrimental to humans too.The team noticed residues of flubendiamide and deltamethrin on kheera (cucumber) resulting from applications of a combination formulation (flubendiamide 90% and deltamethrin 60%). It also studied how long the residue would last on the vegetables when farmers use recommended dose and extra dose of pesticides.Based on the research study, the city farm scientists suggested a maximum residue level of 3 mg per kg of vegetable in case of flubendiamide and 1.5 mg per kg for deltamethrin.However, when compared with the maximum residue level allowed for these substances in developed countries, including European Union (0.2 mg per kg), the recommended dose for vegetables in Telangana is several times higher."

Krishnapriya, who grew up in Veda Nilayam in Poes Garden and lived there until her marriage in 2000.Sources privy to Ms. Krishnapriyas deposition made on January 2 before the Justice Arumughaswamy Commission of Inquiry, where she was summoned, said she claimed that Sasikala had thought of taking Jayalalithaa abroad for better treatment sometime in October 2016 when she was in Apollo Hospitals. But the proposal was turned down by Jayalalithaa.On September 23, 2016, at the hospital, her mother Ilavarasi reportedly told her that Jayalalithaa had gained consciousness in the morning and wanted to know where she was.On being told that she was in a hospital, the then Chief Minister smiled and remarked to a doctor that they would not have been able to bring her to the hospital had she been conscious at the time of shifting.Visitor to ICUStating that no one, except Sasikala, was allowed to meet Jayalalithaa when she was in the Intensive Care Unit, Ms. Krishnapriya said she, her mother and her aunt stayed together on the third floor of the hospital and Sasikala alone used to go to the ICU whenever she was called for.While in hospital, Jayalalithaa ate idlis, pongal and tomato rice in small quantities and even had ice cream.She likes fruits Once she ate grapes and began coughing, Ms. Krishnapriya had told the Commission. [Forest Minister Dindigul C. Sreenivasan had last year apologised publicly claiming he and others had lied that Jayalalithaa ate idli in hospital.]According to her, on December 4, 2016, a day before she died, doctors said that Jayalalithaas brain was functional but the heart could not be resuscitated despite putting her on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). When I reached the hospital, a surgery was underway by cutting open her chest right in the ward. Thereafter, the procedure was continued after shifting her to an operation theatre, she added.Medical miracleShe claimed that her aunt Sasikala expected a medical miracle to happen anytime. Therefore, she asked the doctors to continue to keep Jayalalithaa on life support and provide treatment as usual.The deponent had told the Commission that she was not aware whether Jayalalithaas brain was functional when the life support was withdrawn on December 5, 2016.ECMO was discontinued beyond the evening hours of December 5, 2016. One of her saris was brought from home and it was draped around the body before we took it home.

Field workers of DHAN had been encouraging low-income households to raise gardens of their own so that they could prepare nutritious food. Many are under the assumption that gardening is a pastime of the elite. Even those who are interested in raising a terrace garden are apprehensive of the initial investment and poor yield. We ask such people to raise spinach. They germinate quickly and help in controlling anaemia, a major problem for adolescent girls in Madurai. The encouraging results keep them going, said Lokesh Sinram, Environment Engineer at DHAN Foundation.One can use goat and cow manure, procure good quality soil instead of using hybrid seeds and urea. The substitutes work effectively and provide healthier vegetables, he said.Presently 115 families are involved in rooftop gardening. The effort has seen several enthusiastic women and children investing time and effort into raising the plants. The fear of nutrient-deficient food is urging people to go the organic way and plant a variety of seeds with enough yield for a nuclear family.K. Tamilarasi and her family started their rooftop garden last year. They have raised a variety of plants, including chilli, cabbage, spinach, radish and tomato, and have seen a good yield. We use our own vegetables in our kitchen. Children do not waste food because they understand the effort that goes into producing it, said K. Karthikeyan, her son.As summer looms ahead, the coir bags help retain moisture and provide a cooling effect during daytime. Gardening even brings peace of mind after a stressful day. It also provides additional income for homemakers, thus providing sustainable growth solutions, Mr. Lokesh said.For more information regarding rooftop gardens, contact the Horticulture Department at 96266 04488 or DHAN Foundation at 90924 04647."
5b147c029855b72e9ad63f1d,Learning from the ‘long march’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/learning-from-the-long-march/article23345442.ece,2018-03-25,,The Hindu,"Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis did the right thing when an army of 40,000 barefoot, largely Adivasi farmers descended on Mumbai earlier this month. The right thing, that is, if the objective was to as quickly as possible remove this disturbing reminder of farm distress from the glare of the media  and future, non-farmer voters. He caved in, extended his previous loan waiver scheme to yet more farmers for an even longer period, and also promised to transfer land to Adivasi farmers as guaranteed by the Forest Rights Act of 2006.Convenient movesIt was, however, exactly the wrong thing to do if the objective was to address the root causes of the farmers problems and prevent such acute distress from building up again. But a loan waiver is easier to promise, and does not upset any of the existing political apple carts. And it is easily marketable as a farmer-friendly gesture by a magnanimous government.Except that it isnt. If anybody knows the issues Indian farmers grapple with, its the father of Indias Green Revolution, M.S. Swaminathan. And he said that loan waivers provide at best temporary relief but actually work against the creation of a reliable farm credit system in the long run. Worse, because of the large sums of money involved in such gestures, money that is required for things farmers actually need and will benefit from, like crop and seed research, soil improvement or pest protection, is eaten up by such futile gestures.In the Union Budget for 2018-19, only 12% of the spend is for investments  the rest was eaten up by subsidies, crop insurance schemes and the like. Worse, most of the direct beneficiaries of farm subsidies are in the organised sector  fertiliser companies, tractor manufacturers and so on. The actual farmer gets to see little of the money.But loan waivers are politically sexy, so every State is trying to outdo the other in such competitive populism, particularly as the general elections draw near. While the fiscal position takes a hit because of such write-offs, most of the money, due to corruption and inefficiencies, does not reach the intended beneficiaries. In Maharashtra, of the Rs. 34,000 crore loan waiver announced in 2017 (prior to the latest announcement), only Rs. 13,580 crore was actually disbursed, according to data given to Maharashtra legislators by the State government,Firstpostreported. And even here, it is anybodys guess as to who actually got the money. A Shiv Sena MLA created a furore in the Maharashtra Assembly by pointing out that he had received Rs. 25,000 from the government under the scheme even though he had neither applied for relief, nor, being a legislator, was actually eligible. To be fair, such mix-ups are not the preserve of any one State. More recently in Tamil Nadu, farmers in Dindigul were up in arms after getting compensation cheques for Rs. 5 and Rs. 10, when the government had promised up to Rs. 26,000 per acre for yield loss in paddy!The same old problems recur with depressing regularity. The Odisha Assembly was disrupted last Friday after Opposition MLAs protested the alleged distress sale of tomatoes in the State. Meanwhile in Karnataka, there is acute distress among both toor dal growers and dal millers. The growers, responding to last years surge in retail dal prices, and the governments response of steeply hiking the minimum support price, had produced a bumper crop. Now, they want the government to buy at the promised price, while refusing to sell to millers at the prevailing market price, which is nearly 50% lower.The government says it is seized of the matter and is working on solutions. At a talkfest in the capital last week, Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog, said, It is finally time we must focus only and only on farmers and farmers distress.Thats all very well, but it is not as if the solutions are not known. What farmers actually need is a robust and reliable credit infrastructure which allows them to access credit when they require it, better infrastructure to prevent yield loss (Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself said in a speech last year that agri products worth Rs. 1 lakh crore are ruined annually due to insufficient infrastructure in the agricultural sector), better market access for their output, access to better information on crop prices and, of course, reliable weather-proofing and yield loss insurance.Political turfBut that will mean upsetting many cosy political fiefdoms. Political parties across the spectrum have prevented the flawed agricultural market yard system from being revamped, because it is the basis for exercising political power and influence in rural areas. MSPs remain on paper, arbitrary and irrational price and import/export curbs in the name of the consumer actually end up hurting both consumers and producers one could go on.Perhaps the real lesson to be learnt from farmers protests like the long march is that pushed long enough and hard enough by the current system, the India farmer will eventually rise up and try to change it  with or without your consent."

The wholesale rate of tomato is around Rs 10/kg and its available at Rs 15-20 in retail market, Choithram Sabjimandi Kalyan Sangh secretary Nikhil Hardiya told TOI.He said that as crops supply is expected to reduce, tomatos rate is likely to go up in next month. Wholesale rate of potato is still below Rs 10/kg as good production of the crop and farmers disinterest to keep it in the cold-storage for longtime are stated to be the reasons behind the low-price.Potato is being sold at Rs 7-8 in Choithram wholesale vegetable market while the retail price hovers around Rs 15/kg, Aaloo Pyaaj Vyapari Sangh, Indore vice-president Vijay Garg told TOI.He said that a few weeks ago, potatos wholesale price had hit a new low of the season as the rate had gone down to Rs 1/kg.Quality of the crop, which was sold around Rs 1/kg, was however not as good as what is available in the market. Most of the potato crop, sold earlier, was deteriorating in the cold-storage and to avoid further loss, the farmers sold it at the minimum rate, Garg said.Wholesale rate of garlic has also witnessed a downtrend in recent past.Excess production of the crop is the main reason behind the reduced rate Garg said. Unlike these crops, the rate of another vital commodity i.e. onion has however witnessed a rise.Few weeks ago, the wholesale rate of onion was around Rs 25/kg while the retail price was between Rs 40-45. The crop is now being sold at Rs 30-35/kg in wholesale market while the retail rate is around Rs 50-60/kg Garg said."

This crisis has raised troubling questions about the harvesting of the personal data of millions, and their use in influencing those two defining political events of 2016.A recent article inScienceanalyses the prevalence of false news and delves into the reasons for its proliferation. The results of the research, which studied 126,000 stories tweeted by approximately three million people more than 4.5 million times between 2006 and 2017, might leave cynics unsurprised: The MIT researchers found that false news spreads farther, faster, deeper, and more widely than true news. Yet what might surprise even cynics is that this difference was not due to bots and automatons, but to the efforts of human tweeters. The persons tweeting false stories typically have fewer followers, follow fewer people, and have been on Twitter for a relatively short time. The study also found that false news diffused to between 100 and 100,000 people routinely, whereas truth only reached up to 1,000 people. Many more people retweeted false news than truth. True news took six times as long as falsehood to reach just 1,500 people. They also found that falsehood was 70% more likely to be retweeted. The key reasons behind this, according to the authors, are the emotions inspired by the two types of news. While they found that false news inspired surprise and disgust, truth caused sadness, anticipation, joy and trust. Evidently, the former set is more powerful. Perhaps not coincidentally, psychological analysis was extensively employed by Cambridge Analytica, the data company that exploited the personal data of social media users to target certain demographics with political messaging designed to influence their voting behaviour.In the same issue,Sciencepublished another study which discusses the role of bots and deliberate amplification of fake news. In an email toThe Hindu, author Fillipo Menczer of Indiana University, clarified, The MIT study focusses on one of these factors, namely the novelty of false news. Other factors include cognitive, social, and algorithmic biases that make people vulnerable to manipulation  engagement-based ranking, limited attention, selective exposure, confirmation bias, echo chambers Mr. Menczer highlighted the supplementary materials section of the MIT work which shows that when the contribution of bots is factored out, the spread of false news is suppressed more than that of true news. Therefore, while humans do have an active role in spreading false news, the role of bots as an amplifying factor cannot be discounted.What these studies suggest is that understanding how and why false news spreads, establishing fact-checking sites and spreading awareness among people not to get taken in by novelty value when retweeting or spreading stories could be the key to reducing the spread of false news."

With the local crop arriving in plenty and the price of tomatoes hovering between Rs. 8 and Rs. 5 a kg in the recent past, the arrivals at Rythu Bazaars cross beyond the much required quantity.We have been receiving 50 to 60 quintals a day for the past few days against the requirement of 35 quintals, says D. Narayana Rao, Estate Officer (EO) of Rythu Bazaar, Seethammadhara.Comparatively, tomato growers see rich harvest this year in K. Kotapadu, Pendurthi, Sabbavaram, Kasimkota, Anandapuram and K.K. Agraharam areas. Last year, the local yield was exhausted by this time. This year, we have sufficient crop which will last till April. Once the local supply starts dipping, tomatoes will be sourced from Madanapalle, Kurnool and Bengaluru, says D. Raju, EO of Peda Waltair Rythu Bazaar.Cold storage facilityAlthough consumers are buying large quantities of tomatoes at present, department officials stress on the effective utilisation of cold storage facility to address wastage problem.Though we have two cold storage facilities in Gopalapatnam and MVP Colony Rythu Bazaars with a capacity of five metric tonnes each, most farmers prefer to sell the tomatoes at a nominal cost before they sign off for the day. If they utilise the facility available, it will help them fetch good price for tomotoes, observes T. Linga Murthy, EO of MVP Rythu Bazaar.According to Assistant Director of Horticulture Department K. Sailaja, tomato was grown in 1,085 hectares of area this year against 920 hectares last year. With one-third of farmers using organic farming methods, the tomato yield has gone up considerably, she says. For entrepreneurs who want to invest in the processing units to convert tomatoes into value-added products like jelly, puree, pickles and sauce, the Department of Horticulture is providing 35% credit linked back-ended subsidy which further enables optimum utilisation of the local crop."

5b149ad79855b72ada07d8b4,Why do farmers go marching?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/why-do-farmers-go-marching/article23351136.ece,2018-03-26,,The Hindu,"Why are Indian farmers perpetually in revolt? The question has been raised by many after the recent farmers march to Mumbai and simmering rebellions across the States in recent years.No doubt, agriculture is one segment of the economy on which vote-conscious governments havent skimped on outlays. Over the years, Central governments have allocated ever-rising sums towards procurement, input subsidies and rural employment schemes, while States have periodically announced loan waivers.But that farmer protests have persisted, and even intensified, perhaps shows that many of these schemes arent addressing the right set of problems. The reasons for agricultural distress have changed quite dramatically in recent years.From shortage to plentyA few years ago, farmers seeking to register their protest used to do so beside wilted crops and parched farmlands.But in the last couple of years, farmers from Mandsaur to Salem have given vent to their angst by dumping vast quantities of unsold produce  tomatoes, grapes, onions and milk  on lakebeds and national highways.Historically, agricultural distress in India has been linked to truant monsoons, input shortages and lacklustre yields which frequently put growers on the road to penury.In recent years though, it is surplus output and unremunerative prices that have decimated farm incomes more often.Trends in Indias agricultural output over the last twenty years present an eye-opener to this problem of plenty.For an extended period from 1998-99 to 2009-10, Indias rice output stayed stuck at 85 million tonnes to 95 million tonnes, with drought years such as 2002 and 2004 seeing sharp downward blips.As consumption hovered at 80 to 90 million tonnes in this period, shortages were more frequent than surpluses.But after climbing to 105 million tonnes in 2011-12, Indias rice production has stayed well above the 100 million-tonne mark for the last six years, even scaling110 million tonnes in 2016-17. With offtake still stuck at about 90 million tonnes, theres been persisting excess stock in the market. As a result, in the last five years, wholesale prices of paddy have crept up at a 2.4% annual rate.The wheat story is similar. From a yearly average of about 75 million tonnes in the decade to 2010-11, wheat output leapfrogged to average 94 million tonnes in the last six years. Output, now at 97-98 million tonnes, is now neck-and-neck with domestic demand (about 100 million tonnes) and it may only be a matter of time before it overshoots it. With rising supplies, wholesale wheat prices have inched up at a 2% yearly rate in the last five years.Not too long ago, India was facing a severe shortage of pulses, with output struggling to keep up with the rising protein intake of the masses. But farmers have dramatically ramped up pulses production too. From an annual average of 14 million tonnes in the decade to 2010-11, it has averaged 18 lakh tonnes in the last six years. India harvested a record pulses crop of 23 million tonnes in 2017, matching the official demand estimate, thus dampening once-high market prices for a range of dals. This script of galloping surpluses dampening prices has played out in commercial crops such as sugarcane and tea too.If unremunerative prices have dogged other crops, fruit and vegetable farmers have been up against the high perishability of their produce. In the last fifteen years, India has doubled its potato output, trebled its tomato harvest and managed a fourfold increase in onion output. But poor storage facilities and State laws that keep farmers bound to their local mandis, have exposed farmers to wild swings in prices.Driving the outputIt is noteworthy that agricultural output has held up at relatively high levels in recent years, despite erratic monsoons. This could be because the droughts in 2014 and 2015 have been far less severe than those in 2009 or 2002.In 2014, a drought year, the country still harvested 105 million tonnes of rice, 86 million tonnes of wheat and 17 million tonnes of pulses. Hefty hikes in the Centres Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) have also had a big role to play in farmers ratcheting up output. In the last ten years, the support prices for wheat and paddy have risen 73% and 108% and those on pulses have trebled. In recent years, State governments have also competed furiously with the Centre, announcing bonuses and their own support prices for crops such as onions, tomatoes, potatoes and even green chillies.Illusory profitsIt is early days yet to say if recent improvements in Indias farm output are here to stay. But after responding enthusiastically to signals from MSPs for many years, farmers have lately found the mechanism failing them. Market prices for many crops have tended to plunge and stay below their official MSPs for extended periods.For one, though the Centre announces MSPs for 24 crops, the bulk of its procurement operations (via FCI) are restricted to just two  rice and wheat, with NAFED chipping in on pulses.State-level procurement operations are even more adhoc, lacking both direction and funding. Therefore, while a farmer may plant mustard, grapes or onions in any given year based on the MSP promise, theres really no guarantee that he will get that price when he visits the mandi.Two, even in crops where the Centre or State agencies are active, their market interventions tend to be too selective and sporadic to make any real difference to a majority of farmers. Despite the Centre doubling down on procurement in 2017-18, it will mop up only about a third of Indias rice and wheat output and a tenth of the pulses harvest. So, if good monsoons result in more crops moving into surplus zone, market forces will continue to prevail over MSPs.Three, given that the Centres market interventions on rice and wheat have proved so ineffectual despite large spends, it is unclear how the Centre or copycat States will fund MSPs in a host of other crops.New fixesTo be fair, the NDA has been trying out new policy fixes to address such problems. It is piloting price deficiency payments in place of MSPs to compensate farmers for price-related losses.It plans to replace input subsidies with direct cash transfers. It has kick-started a national electronic market for produce and is nudging States to repeal their APMC Acts, which prevent farmers from selling in markets of their choice.But its aggressive inflation-fighting efforts and on-off trade policies still work to the detriment of farmers. In the last couple of years, despite supply gluts, the Centre has continued with sizeable imports of wheat and pulses at low tariffs.Handling of spikesSeasonal spikes in prices of sugar, atta or rice are often met with export taxes, minimum export prices or even outright export bans.States, on their part, continue to be quite adamant about levying high taxes and hanging on to the draconian mandis, which force farmers to rely heavily on middlemen.This puts the Indian farmer in a Heads I win, tails you lose situation. If market prices of crops hit rock-bottom, the government is helpless to rescue them. But if prices soar, the government prevents them from making hay by clamping down.All this makes it clear why Indian farmers are seething. Its for the same reason that salaried employees are often unhappy. Who would like being rewarded peanuts, after being highly productive?"
5b149bfc9855b72e9ad64eb5,Farmers gain from Israeli agriculture technology,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/farmers-gain-from-israeli-agri-tech/articleshow/62451023.cms,2018-01-11,,The Times Of India,"AHMEDABAD: Kalpesh Patel, a farmer in Prantij , earlier made Rs 4 lakh growing cabbage and cauliflower on his 16 bighas of land. Today, from the same produce on the same land, he earns Rs 15 lakh. The secret to his nearly three-fold rise in income is the new Israeli hi-tech protective cultivation and precision farming method.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu will visit Patel and his facility later this week. Patel is not alone. Some 50,000 farmers like him have reaped the benefits of the Centre of Excellence for Protective Cultivation and Precision Farming on Vegetables. The centre at Vadrad village in Sabarkantha district has played a pivotal role in extension of the Indo-Israel Agriculture Plan (IIAP) to 50,000 farmers in the 30 months since it was set up.The Vadrad centre is one of eight in the state, set up in collaboration with Israel. Jitendra Patel, the deputy director for horticulture, who is in charge of the centre, says that the centre is set to demonstrate the technology to farmers and extend it to them, increasing their income.Jitendra Patel said the Vadrad centre raises pest and disease-free saplings at the nominal price of Re 1 per sapling from farmers seeds and hands back saplings to be transplanted in fields. The Vadrad centre has been developed under IIAP at a cost of Rs 11.47 crore. It is focusing on protected cultivation of vegetables.The project has four high-tech temperature and moisture-controlled polyhouses or nurseries, where seedlings are grown for a fortnight under protection till they reach a certain height. Technologies like drip irrigation, protective cultivation of germinated seedlings and a precise mixture of soil and vermicompost are used, which lead to savings on fertilizer costs further on. The seedlings so produced are of high quality and disease-free.Patel said that because of the centre, farmers also get their crop before the trading season begins and consequently, better prices. With the produce arriving a fortnight before others, the farmer earns twice as much as he would in the middle of the season. The quality of vegetables also improves, with the minimal use of chemicals. He added that the fertilizer costs are cut by 70%.Kalpesh Patel, the farmer from Prantij, says, If we choose conventional sowing, there is a fear of damage to the crop. If we sow seed directly in the field, about 25% do not germinate and this is also a direct loss. In the first month, we have to spray insecticide on three or four times, to save seedling from pests and insects. With the seedling developed at the centre, I save on pesticides. During the monsoon, delayed rains can damage growth and hence if I opt for a 30-day seedling, there is no damage even if the rains are delayed.Ahmedabad: In Kadi and Kalol, it is not only the usual tomato, but now also cabbage and cauliflower which is drawing traders from Delhi. Officials of the horticulture department said around 10 traders would would usually go to Kadi or Kalol, are now camping in Prantij, despatching cabbage and cauliflower consignments to Delhi. Officials said about one truckload of cabbage and cauliflower is sent to Delhi every day. Demand for cauliflower is high in north India and traders coming to Kadi and Kalol are also setting up centres in Prantij.Mamroli Grad Turns Farmer, Taps Israeli Ideas For Huge ProfitsAhmedabad: Samir Patel, a B.Sc. in chemistry, has decided to adopt farming as his full-time profession. On a cue from the Centre of Excellence for protected cultivation and precision farming in Vadrad village, he has set up his own nursery. The turnover of his nursery per annum is around Rs 1.5 crore.Patel, a resident of Mamroli, said he was always interested in farming with the latest technology. When I learnt about the centre, I was the first farmer to utilise its services, he said.I still remember that I gave the seeds of bitter gourd (karela) for seeding and, after I received the benefits, I came to the centre and studied the technology in detail, Samir Patel said.He said that he had 25 bighas of land and had taken another 330 bighas in the area on lease. In the year 2014, his profits after deducting the expenses came to around Rs 20 lakh.After adopting Israeli technology, my income had grown and now I make a net profit of around Rs 60 lakh, Samir said.He further said that he was now into farming of potatoes, bitter gourd, tomato, chillis, brocolli, red cabbage and cauliflower, among others. He further said that he had also entered into contract for potato farming with some big multinationals.Regarding the nursery that had been set up on the lines of the Vadrad centre, he said that he had grown seeds at the government centre at Vadrad and had a turnover of Rs 1.5 crore from this nursery alone.Patel further said that his farming had grown so large in scale that now even his wife Daxa had to assist him in taking care of the nursery."

But this year the winter mist has been severe and has affected several other crops too, says R Moorthy, a farmer from Velliyangadu in Karamadai.Moorthy said he had planted jasmine, tuberose and curry leaves in his field. Tuberose crop used to yield 40kg of flowers, but this winter, it has come down to 10kg on average, he says. Curry leaves production has halved to 5kg per acre, he adds. The leaves of tuberose yellow in winter, reducing the crops productivity and also the tender shoots of curry leaves wither in the mist.Flowers traders said the prices of flowers have skyrocketed in the local markets. KK Ayyappan, treasurer of flower market in the city, said the same season last year jasmine price was Rs 1,000 per kg. This year the inflow has been badly hit. And also Friday being a muhurtham day, the prices have touched Rs 2,400 a kilogram, he says.Ayyappan also said inflow of other flowers including rose, sevvanthi, arali, vaadamalli, kozhikkondai and kakatan malli, which were majorly traded in the market, had fallen. On ordinary days the market sees an inflow of 50 tonnes of flowers in total. In festive season it goes up to 200 tonnes. On Thursday the market got only 10 tonnes of flowers in total, he says.Similarly, vegetables like brinjal, tomato, ladies finger and green chilly have seen a dip in production in winter, say farmers.Winter is a very unfavourable season for these crops, says P Kandasamy, district secretary of farmers association. In winter a fungal disease called adi sambal noi (peronospora) affects production of these crops, he adds. But the prices of these vegetables have not seen a raise as of now, he adds.S Panneerselvam, head of Agro Climate Research Centre, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, said, till the third week of January, there would be mist formation, which would affect the cultivation of certain crops, especially flowers like jasmine.After the third week of January, there would be no mist formation and we could expect the jasmine production to go up, he added."

On Wednesday (March 28), the price stood at Rs. 7.20. However, it jumped to Rs. 12.80 per kg on Thursday. Incidentally, the price has plummeted to Rs. 2 a kg and even below at several markets in southern States.Chairman of the Madanapalle tomato market committee R. Gurappa Naidu said since November, the price had not gone down below Rs. 5, which was a unique thing in the annals of the local market. The peak season would commence with April, with stocks of about 800 tonnes a day reaching the market, as against the current supply of around 200 tonnes, he said.ExportsWe are expecting large-scale exports from April 15, as Madanapalle market will alone remain stable thanks to congenial climate for tomato cultivation in the country.

Satish KumarAt a time when all things organic is the buzzword, poly-houses are becoming a cause for concern due to high pesticide residues in the produce following indiscriminate use of chemicals.In fact, the sustainability of poly-house cultivation is facing a threat as a sizeable number of them have closed due to soil degradation and attack by nematodes  harmful soil bacteria  and fungi, which have resulted in massive devastation of crops.The Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR) has now come out with a series of technologies and practices to reduce the use of chemicals in poly-house cultivation.The main focus is to turn the high-end poly-house cultivation into a sustainable farm and economic activity, said M.S. Rao, head of IIHRs Division of Entomology and Nematology.This will result in not only production of pesticide-free produce, but it will go a long way in improving the financial health of poly-houses, he said, while indicating that closing down poly-houses would result in a loss of Rs. 900 crore.What has come as a shot in the arm for the IIHR is that a 24-year-old farmer Raju in Doddaballapur taluk near Bengaluru has used this technology showing it is possible to grow broccoli, a crop highly susceptible to various pests and diseases, without pesticides.It is the first time in the country that broccoli has been grown in a chemical-free manner in a poly-house.Of course, the experiment is not completely organic as the farmer has used a certain amount of fertilizers. But, the produce has been selling like hot cakes to exporters at a premium price since it is pesticide-free.Mr. Raju, who migrated to Karnataka from Andhra Pradesh, took up poly-house cultivation on about one acre of land in Doddaballapur, of which broccoli is grown on half an acre.What has enthused scientists is that he has trounced the general perception that chemical-free farming and reduction in fertilizers would lead to drop in yield. The farmers yield has not only increased by about 30% by using the natural plant growth promoters as well as bio-fertilisers and bio-pesticides of IIHR, but the cost of cultivation too has dropped by about 30% as he has not used chemicals and pesticides. He was able to earn about Rs. 4.18 lakh in 90 days.Dr. Rao said the farmer used bio fungicide, bio nematicide, bio bactericide, bio fertilizers, neem and pongamia soaps as well as plant growth promoters developed by the IIHR.It has helped improve soil fertility and reduce soil-borne pathogens.If a farmer uses these chemical-free and cost-effective applications for two to three years, there is no need for soil enrichment for the next five years, he said. Biotechnologist-turned entrepreneur J. Gavaskar, who has taken licences from the IIHR to mass produce and also sell some of its bio technologies, says the awareness among farmers is slowly increasing about such bio applications. Big farmers and some Farmer Producers Organisations from Pune, some cities in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala are trying out these chemical-free applications, he said.Other successesDr. Rao said ICAR-IIHR has demonstrated similar success stories in capsicum, European cucumber, tomato, gerbera, carnations grown under protected conditions in various poly-houses and guava, pomegranate, tomato, okra, brinjal, tuberose grown under open field conditions in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra, and Bengal."

In and around Ripon Street, Elliott Road and other Anglo-Indian bastions in central Kolkata, women like Pamela bent over bubbling pots and pans and red-hot ovens as they dished out delicacies like juicy jalfrezi, tangy pepper water, rich ball curry, yellow rice, pantras and more. Lunch after Sunday service was an elaborate affair as the lanes would fill up with the rich aromas as families congregated around the table over food, conversation and maybe some music later in the afternoon. Much of that magic is gone, with flickers of that life and lifestyle surviving in corners like Bow Barracks.There was a time when I used to cook for many, many people. We used to host parties almost every day. My husband, Rubin Rebeiro, was a musician, who used to play at Princes in Grand Hotel. He used to have hundreds of visitors. Ours was a buzzing house. Today, I live alone as my son works in Hyderabad and I dont feel like cooking for myself. However, hes got married and my daughter-in-law will be staying with me; so things may change, says Pamela.People who grew up in and around central Kolkata have a deep connection with the community and its food. There was a mansion in front of my Beniapukur house in which lived four or five Anglo-Indian families. One of them was Mr Jardine, recalls actor-musician-director Anjan Dutt , whos had a strong association with the community since childhood. He had a very beautiful daughter, Alison, and I liked her a lot. I was very young then. They used to make some amazing kofta curry and yellow rice. The smell used to drift to our house and I used to gorge on the food. I dont know if it was because of my tender age, or my strong admiration for Alison, but the mind-blowing flavour of that food is etched in my mind. I have never tasted any other plate of ball curry-yellow rice tastier than that. Now, they are all gone, the director adds.There are not many families left, to start with, says Reethu Sarawgi, a septuagenarian retired teacher of La Martiniere for Girls, Kolkata. The Anglo-Indian community felt isolated after Independence. Almost all my friends left by the early 60s for the UK, Canada and Australia , she adds. Reethu feels her food habits have been influenced by her friends or her hostel life in school. If you went to a school that is under the Church of North India, you would develop a love for Anglo food. I remember the delicious sausage curry and country captain  dry beef curry  made by a dear friend of mine, Yvonne Pinto, who passed away recently. I will never forget that taste, rues Reethu, who is a Malayali by birth but grew up with Anglo-Indian friends, and still savours Anglo food almost every day.But it is not just the exodus, there are other factors to it too, says Anjan. The wine-and-dine culture of Park Street died a sad death due to the heavy entertainment tax. Once my friend, musician Nondon Bagchi, and I held an informal survey and counted around 600 entertainers on Park Street  musicians, cabaret dancers, singers and so on. The whole lot of those people left, and with them, their culture also left, the director adds.However, Anglo-Indian cuisine has never really been part of restaurant business in Kolkata. There are places that serve one or two items like jalfrezi and roast, but eateries dedicated to the cuisine have been a rarity. Traditionally, the authentic food is cooked in almost every Anglo household even today. A family lunch will mean a week-long preparation involving shopping for meat, marinating it with right ingredients, buying dill and other herbs and then finally preparing it, which could go on for a couple of days.While we definitely love other cuisines, we eat Anglo-Indian food almost every day at our house. I had yellow rice and ball curry today, and yesterday mashi (the cook, a lady from Nadia) made pantras. My daughters are equally happy if they have pasta for dinner but our generation is a bit more traditional and we love our food, says Barry OBrien, quizmaster and president-in-chief of The All-India Anglo-Indian Association . We Anglo-Indians take our food very seriously. Families swear by their cook, who used to be called boy, khansama or bowchi (derived from bawarchi). In my childhood, we used to have a fantastic cook, Appana Rao, who was from the Andhra-Odisha border. I remember, we never used to take packed lunch to our school, St Xaviers, as it would get cold. Appana used to cook and the fresh hot lunch in tiffin carriers would be brought to school, recalls Barry.Also, Anglo-Indians have a special inclination for leftover food. Cooking a little extra is our kitchen culture, mainly for two reasons  to cater to sudden, wanted or unwanted, guests, and to relish the dish a day later, says Barry. By far my favourite breakfast over the years has been quarter-boiled eggs, (not half-boiled, not hard-boiled!) mashed with aloo chops from dinner the night before, he adds.A family lunch can mean a week-long preparation and daylong cooking. Our families are closely knit. We still try and meet on every occasion for a large meal. Typical Anglo families still carry on this tradition, says Christine Beaucasin, who works at the Oral School for Deaf Children. Our parties are still incomplete without jalfrezi, vindaloo, pantras, roasts and so on, she adds.But are there shops dedicated to Anglo-Indian groceries? Not really. We use a lot of onions, ginger, garlic, tomato. You can buy them from anywhere, really. For meat and the sausages, we go to New Market or Entally bazar, says Christina Samuel. We usually have an elaborate three course meal  soup, side dishes and desserts. Each day of the Christmas holiday season has been extremely busy for us. We were either invited to someones place for lunch or dinner or some friends or family visited us, says Christina. While the tradition of cooking runs in family, tedious items like ball curry and butt curry are going out of fashion, she says.Is the younger generation a tad reluctant to carry forward the cuisine of the community? While a section of the older generation thinks so, many of the youngsters dont agree. Our food is a family affair. It passes from one generation to the next. I love to cook. I make fantastic steaks. Anglo men are usually good cooks as they love to eat, quips Joshua Samuel, Christinas 32-year-old son.Brandon Claudius, son of hockey player Olympian Leslie Claudius agrees. I dont get time every day due to my erratic work hours but I am also a foodie. Korma, bhuni vindaloo  I love to eat and I love to cook for my family, he says. His wife, Jilian, too, cooks Anglo food almost every day at home. There are many Anglo-Indian snacks including kul kul and rose cookies that we used to make at home before Christmas. Now, we buy them from the market as those are very elaborate, she adds.However, for those who are reluctant to cook, you have home delivery. Ive never enjoyed cooking and Ive never cooked. Ive always sourced my food from reliable home deliveries. And more often than not, I get Anglo food, says Reethu.Veronica Pacheco, a retired service woman, delivers lunch and dinner to around 15 families every day. They are all retired people. I have a dabbawala who delivers the lunch boxes to them. The menu is simple  rice, dal, sabzi and one non-veg item of fish, beef or pork, she tells us. Apart from the retired households, Veronica also delivers to the clubs that serve Anglo-Indian food on special occasions. Usually at Bingo parties, I prepare food for around 150 people. I served everywhere  Dalhousie Institute, Calcutta Rangers Club, Armenian Club and all. I prepare thorough Anglo-Indian food  aloo chops, shami beef tikias, pantras, cutlets, pork roast, tongue roast. My father, Vivian George Thompson was a very good cook and he taught me. When I lost my husband in 2012, I started feeling a bit lonely and so I chose to engage myself like this, says Veronica, who stays alone as her son works in Melbourne.If you havent tasted Anglo-Indian sausages, you are missing out on a slice of life Kolkata has to offer. These hard-core pork sausages are far from the skinny machine-made Frankfurters you get at shopping mall freezers. Anglo-Indian sausages are stuffed with onion, ginger, aromatic herbs and sets of secret spice mixes apart from mince. We make our own masala. From the garam masalas to haldi and coriander  we grind them to make it perfect, says Bablu Khatik who runs Chamans Pork Shop at Park Circus market with his brother Rahul and uncle Sunil. Cooking the sausages also involves a unique process. You dont need to grill or fry them; as they need boiling for at least 40 minutes. Here is a small tip for you. Take water just adequate to boil the sausages. Bring it to boil along with the meat (with pierced skin) and cook it till the water is absorbed. The meat will be cooked by the fat it releases. From balanced heat to right spices and sweetness of onions and cinnamon, the tastes explode in your mouth with a bang. The only problem is these sausages are not widely sold. Besides Park Circus market, you can find them at Entally market, Taltala market and New Market.Yellow rice-ball (or kofta curry): Rich meatball curry with flavoured rice cooked in coconut milk with a pinch of turmericPork vindaloo: Goan and Anglo-Indians fight over this spicy dish. We hijacked vindaloo from Goan cuisine and now we make it better, quipsBarry OBrienJalfrezi with white rice and pepper water: This meat preparation is on the dry side. Pepper water has no pepper in it but the gravy is made of tamarind paste and other masalas. You have to have white rice to enjoy the platterPantras: Deep-fried, meat-stuffed pancakesAloo chops: Croquettes made of minced-meat, coated with potatoHaddiguddi ballychow: Ballychow is a prawn paste that is used as an ingredient. Pork bones and a little bit of meat is cooked with ballychow and a lot of tomatoes"

Some airlines are embracing the idea of healthier flying, offering calorie-conscious menus and new exercise videos.According to Beth McGroarty, research director for The Global Wellness Institute, a non-profit organisation for the wellness industry, even as seats shrink and flights get more crowded, many carriers want air travel to be more bearable (and even enjoyable). They believe wellness is the way to do that. Its part of the larger wellness movement happening in the travel industry, she says.More democraticAnd, unlike the usual trend of ramping up onboard amenities for only their first- and business-class customers and stripping them away for passengers in economy, Ms. McGroarty says that no passengers are left out in this recent wellness push. Wellness in the air, in many instances, is more democratic.All customers on United Airlines and JetBlue have access to the popular digital meditation service Headspace as a part of their in-flight entertainment. JetBlues Headspace content includes videos that address travel topics such as fear of flying and difficulty sleeping upright.Among international carriers, Swiss Air offers Headspace onboard long-haul flights, and British Airways has a Well Being channel on its in-flight entertainment systems that includes meditation and stretching exercises. Hong Kong-based carrier Cathay Pacific recently launched six in-flight videos, called Travel Well With Yoga, in a partnership with Pure Yoga, the popular yoga studio chain. Videos are between five and 20 minutes, and feature yoga and meditation exercises such as hip and back stretches and deep breathing.Passenger surveysAmerican Airlines started prioritising wellness after conducting customer surveys and running focus groups with fliers about what they want. We learned that our passengers care a lot about their well-being, says Nick Richards, the companys director of customer experience.According to Americans research, travellers wanted to sleep more soundly in the skies, and to that end, the airline recently tapped mattress and bedding brand Casper to design pillows, blankets and other products that are supposed to help with a more comfortable sleep. Premium economy passengers receive a lumbar pillow and a soft cotton blanket while the Casper amenities for international first- and business-class passengers include mattress pads, pillows, blankets and pyjamas.Tucking inMental well-being and sleep aside, airlines are also incorporating wellness onboard by offering healthier food and drink options.Turkish Airlines, for instance, has a new Fly Good Feel Good campaign that includes a menu of herbal teas such as one with rooibos, sage and lavender to help relieve stress and promote sleep. Another is an energising blend with mate, mint and ginger. Children are offered a traditional Turkish drink with milk, carob powder and date syrup thats meant to strengthen the bones.In January, TAP Air Portugal tapped five Michelin-starred Portuguese chefs to create low-calorie Portuguese-influenced entrees for its business-class passengers. Those entrees will also be offered to economy passengers starting this summer, says Joel Fragata, head of the airlines in-flight products.Jos Avillez, of the two Michelin-starred Lisbon restaurant Belcanto, crafted a stone bass in tomato and onion stew, along with coriander and basil potatoes for TAPs flyers while Henrique S Pessoa, of the Michelin-starred Alma, also in Lisbon, came up with a lemongrass and ginger chicken curry.A handful of domestic, American carriers, too, are encouraging mindful eating. Dr. Charles Platkin, a nutrition and public health advocate, and the director of the Hunter College NYC Food Policy Center, conducts an annual airline food study where he analyses the economy food of every domestic carrier.NY Times"

The seven-member team, who have been successfully raising quality seedlings in the rain shelter installed at the office compound, now boasts of a strong clientele.We supplied around 2,000 seedlings today and there are times we struggle to keep up with the demand. People come from far off places and often, we have to give seedlings with just the first signs of green, says Thulasi Bhai, one of the members.The Chittumala block panchayat launched the project last year in a bid to avoid chemical-laced vegetables and promote organic farming in every household. Hybrid seeds were procured from College of Agriculture, Vellayani, to ensure 100% germination. All the seven women underwent training at a seed farm where they were taught how to grow seedlings in a scientific manner using organic compost. We provided the infrastructure along with trays and seeds and the seedlings are grown in a mix of coco peat and vermicompost. The saplings are priced Rs. 3 each and we are also planning to open a counter to sell them, says Aji Abraham, womens welfare officer who coordinated the project.Functioning under the guidance of Agricultural Assistant Director T.A. Kalpana, the agro farm offers spinach, eggplant, tomato, okra, green chilly, capsicum and beans seedlings.Along with seedlings, the group members are also growing a vegetable garden in the block panchayat compound.Recently we got around 50kg of green chilly and since it is organic, the product had many takers. Currently, we are in the process of preparing land so that we could grow more vegetables with the onset of rains, says Thulasi. Saniya Aby, Hymavathy Amma, Krishnakumari, Sharada, Jessy and Sindhu are the other members of the Gramasree team."

(File) Mandeep Singh, a vegetable trader at the same market, said the retail consumer is sure to be hit hard. (File)At the largest vegetable market of Jalandhar, Maqsudan mandi, tomato was being sold at Rs 40-70 per crate, which has 20 kgs, as per wholesale price. The same crate on Friday sold for Rs 300 more, almost a five-time high in a day. Similarly, the wholesale price of Shimla Mirch (capsicum) was Rs 50 for 15 kgs on Thursday. On Friday, it was being sold for Rs 225 per 15 kgs, again a five-time hike.A similar hike was seen in the prices of several vegetables because of the 10-day nationwide agitation by farmers that started Friday. During this period, farmers have announced to go on leave and will not supply vegetables and milk in cities. In Punjab, three out of 11 farmers organisations are supporting the stir. One can well imagine what would be the picture in the coming 10 days, said Rohit Sharma, a vegetable trader at Maqsudan.Mandeep Singh, another vegetable trader at the same market, said the retail consumer is sure to be hit hard.A retailer from vegetable market at Partap Bagh area said, Because of the transportation charges in carrying vegetables from wholesale to retail markets, our margins are high.Subhash, who owns a vegetable shop in Mai Hiran Gate area, echoes his view. Meanwhile, several farmers were seen moving on tractors in the city today and stopping others farmers not supporting the agitation from supplying vegetables and milk to city areas. The protesting farmers also created a ruckus at Maqsudan mandi by throwing away vegetables bough by traders from farmers in bulk. We request them not to disturb us as we are not opposing their protest at all, said Prem Singh, a wholesaler at Maqsudan.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

(Express Photo by Sahil Walia) Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar. (Express Photo by Sahil Walia)Opposition Congress and INLD on Sunday launched a scathing attack on the Khattar led BJP government alleging every section was fed up with its misrule.In separate news conferences here, Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda and INLDs Abhay Singh Chautala targeted the state government over a host of issues including those on farmers, employees, youth and players. Hooda said Manohar Lal Khattar governments Bhavantar Bharpayee Yojana, launched to protect the growers in the event of crash in prices, had failed to yield results. He said recently farmers at many places had been forced to throw their tomato crops on roads or give them to the Gaushalas.The government did not come to the rescue of tomato farmers when prices crashed. They have not got any benefit under this Yojana, the former chief minister claimed. On the players issue, he said: The government first cancelled the awards ceremony and afterwards has been coming out with contradictory statements regarding honouring them. They are not clear which policy they have to follow and players are being disrespected. He was also asked about the state government suspending Haryana Staff Selection Commission chairman B B Bharti after a row over an objectionable question pertaining to Brahmins, in an examination conducted by the board.Hooda said there was no provision to suspend HSSC chairman and the government should either dismiss him or ask him to resign. He said, moreover, the state government too should be held equally responsible as it was not a mere mistake in a question paper but an insult to the entire Brahmin community. Hooda also asked the government to immediately resolve the issue of ongoing strike by the sanitation workers. While this government keeps talking so much about Swachh Bharat and Swachh Haryana, it is making no efforts to end the 10-day old strike which has resulted in heaps of garbage being piled up and inconvenienced the citizens he stated.Meanwhile, INLDs senior leader Abhay Singh Chatuala, while addressing another news conference, demanded the Khattar government issue a white paper on the five foreign trips undertaken by the Chief Minister and those part of his entourage on different occasions giving full details. Chautala said that while the government has claimed that investments worth over Rs 7 lakh crore had fructified as a result of MoUs signed with various governments and other agencies during these trips, the white paper should detail how much revenue has actually been garnered out of these investments.Chautala, who is Leader of Opposition in the State Assembly, also said that the Chief Minister had claimed that lot of wasteful expenditure has been incurred as part of hospitality expenses during Hoodas tenure. ..then it is the responsibility of the present government to tell what steps are being taken to reclaim that money, he added. However, while reacting to this, Hooda said, if people come to meet the Chief Minister (during his time), it is his responsibility to offer them a cup of tea and snacks. But everyone knows that nobody comes to meet him (Khattar). If they have their way, the present government would even set up a Commission of Inquiry to go into how much tea and biscuits had been consumed on the hospitality that was extended. On criticism by Hooda to INLD-BSPs ongoing Jail Bharo Andolan on SYL canal issue, and his dubbing it as Bus Bharo Andolan, Chautala said,those coming from five star culture will not understand our agitation.Our leaders and workers have been courting arrest and authorities let us off in the evening saying they do not have any place to keep us in jails. Hooda had said that INLDs Jail Bharo Andolan on SYL was limited to getting on to the buses, courting arrest and getting released in the evening. Had they been serious, they would have actually gone to jail on this issue, Hooda said.On the developments in Karnataka, both Hooda and Chautala said B S Yedurappas resignation had thoroughly exposed the BJP, which allegedly wanted to encourage horse trading despite knowing they did not have numbers on their side to cobble up a majority.Replying to another question, Chautala said Mayawati-led third front will come into existence and the BSP supremo will be the countrys next prime minister after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

But traders say that in a months time, vegetables may turn dearer.Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra recorded a good yield of vegetables due to copious rainfall last year, said A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam.The produce was harvested simultaneously. Due to the good yield, the prices of many vegetables continue to be low. However, it may begin to increase soon. There may be no new yield due to summer and water shortage. The rising heat level will play a role in price rise. The quality of produce will also be affected, he said. As on Tuesday, a kg of onions from Andhra Pradesh was priced at Rs. 10 to Rs. 12, while onions supplied from Maharashtra were priced at Rs. 12 to Rs. 15 depending on size, variety and quality, he added.Tomatoes were priced at Rs. 8 per kg. In fact, last week, the price ranged from Rs. 5 to 10, he pointed out. Potatoes cost Rs. 20 to Rs. 22, while small onions were priced at Rs. 20 to Rs. 25.The rates of a few vegetables have been on the rise. The cost of beans has increased from Rs. 10-Rs. 15 nearly 15 days ago to Rs. 40 now. Beans and cauliflower are easily perishable during summer. Cauliflower is priced at Rs. 20 to Rs. 30 a piece, he added. Another vegetable that has turned costlier is the local thorny brinjal. Last week, a kg was priced in the range of Rs. 10 to 12.

With the peak summer days round the corner, the cost of several vegetables is slowly on the rise.Traders at the Koyambedu wholesale market noted that the prices of vegetables were steadily increasing since the last week of March. While some vegetables are costlier by up to 40 % compared to last month, most of them are priced at least 20 % more. However, many merchants reported brisk sales due to the festive season.Beans, broad beans and tomatoes are among the costly vegetables this season. While one kg of beans is sold for nearly Rs. 55 depending on the quality, broad beans are priced at Rs. 50 a kg in the wholesale market. These vegetables are sold for Rs. 65-Rs. 70 a kg at the retail market.Some residents like Sivagami B., a resident of Anna Nagar, use green vegetables from their home garden more often to deal with runaway increase in prices.According to wholesale traders at Koyambedu, the citys hub of perishable goods, some staple vegetables such as potato, onion and small onions remain affordable. Drumsticks are among the few seasonal vegetables that are cheaper.P. Sukumar, treasurer, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants Welfare Association, said the prices of vegetables begin to increase in April as yield would be less due to depleting groundwater sources. Even vegetables like chayote (chow chow) that are priced within Rs. 15 a kg are costly as the market did not receive its share from Karnataka. The demand for cucumber and lime has also pushed the prices up this week.The Koyambedu market receives 320 truckloads of produce daily, which is nearly 80 trucks less compared to March.We dont expect a steep hike like last March as there is sporadic rainfall across the State now and also in Karnataka. Vegetables were at least 50% costly than usual during May and June last year, he said."

Mumbaikars will thus have to wait for at least a few months before they can catch a glimpse of them.Dr. Komal Raul, veterinary doctor at the zoos hospital who is supervising their care, said, Among emus, it is the father who incubates the eggs. But he did not do so for the first 25 eggs. We were unsuccessful in incubating them in our facility too. The father incubated only five eggs of which four hatched and one is still in process. The chicks were born on April 7 and moved to the hospital immediately. Parent-birds may not allow constant monitoring of chicks or may neglect them, even trampling upon them. Besides, the chicks are susceptible to infection.In 2016, Byculla Zoo saw thousands of visitors each day coming to see the newly-acquired Humboldt penguins. The penguins are still the star attraction despite the management charging an entry fee. The zoo has always had emu birds, a variety native to Australia. The zoo had two females and one male, and one of these pairs gave birth to a chick around three years ago, followed by the four chicks last month. The parent-birds had laid 30 eggs, of which only these four survived.Emu birds are flightless but are known to be the second largest birds after the ostrich. They can grow up to six feet in height and weigh up to 50 kg.The chicks are doing well and are active, said hospital authorities. They are being fed green salads, bird feed, tomatoes, fruits, boiled eggs and sprouts. Their weight is recorded everyday.Dr. Sanjay Tripathi, Director of Byculla zoo, said, When they will be brought to the enclosure for public viewing is a decision doctors will take. Meanwhile, authorities are hopeful about the fifth egg."

A sum of Rs. .9.64 lakh was provided for the purpose.Five self-help groups (SHGs), including three womens groups, have been constituted under the project and each group consists of 10 to 14 members. All expenses  including the rent of land, seeds, organic manure, pump sets for irrigation, agricultural implements, and wages  were borne by the department.Our produce is in good demand among the consumers as our farming methods are transparent and can be viewed by anyone, says A. Kavalan, tribal cheftain, Kavadam Paniya settlement, and president of the Surya SHG.Lower pricesThough organic produce are priced at a premium, the SHGs sell vegetables at rates less than the market price. Earlier, the members used to sell their produce to middlemen. Later, they made a tie-up with Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) to avoid middlemen and to get a better income, says A. Manojkumar, committed social worker of the Department said.We have sold nearly one tonne of yard-long beans through Kudumbasree at Rs. 22 a kg .The harvest of other vegetables will start soon, K. Meenakshi, president of the Arya SHG, said.While vegetable traders in nearby towns sell vegetable procured from Gundlupet in Karnataka at a higher price, we are able to sell pesticide-free produce at 20% to 25% lower than the market rate, she said.We expect a profit of Rs. 15 lakh from he project this season, says N.J. Reji, tribal extension officer, Kaniyampetta grama panchayat.We were able to provide 60 working days to 64 families in the past two months and the profit from the project will be utilised as a revolving fund to expand vegetable cultivation to ensure a sustainable income to tribal members, he said."

Our efforts are now focussed on consolidating our position and market share in Complan, said HIPL managing director Sankalp Potbhare in an interaction, declining to comment on future product line-ups.In India, Complan is a 50-year-old brand, offering milk-based nutrition beverage. It was learnt that Complans market share had slipped to single digit for various reasons over the last few years.Bulk of HIPLs (also known as Kraft Heinz) Indian revenues are from Glucon-D (more than 40%), followed by more than 30% from Complan. The rest are from other segments.Mr. Potbhare said that the companys Rs. 6,000-crore milk food drink (MFD) segment comprised brands like Horlicks and Boost, Bournvita and Complan besides some local brands. Tamil Nadu and West Bengal together accounted for 30% of HIPLs MFD market.Changed formulationsSince our re-launch in August 2017, with changed formulations, we have gained in market share.

5b1538339855b76a5f1a07a0,Fruit of labour eludes farmers,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/fruit-of-labour-eludes-farmers/article23790028.ece,2018-05-06,,The Hindu,"Vegetable prices have remained nearly constant for the past decade at Rythu Bazaars, data sourced from Rythu Bazaar website shows. Except for a brief bump in 2017 when tomato prices touched Rs. 85 during summer, the prices have fluctuated in a narrow band of Rs. 6 and Rs. 20, occasionally going up to Rs. 30. What this means for farm income can be easily guessed.Vegetable prices, even for a perishable item like tomatoes, are a product of demand and supply. When both are nearly constant, the price will remain constant. The produce that reaches Hyderabad is not just local. Farmers from far flung districts like Madanapalle, Vizag and Chittoor also get their produce here. That benefits the consumers who pay between Rs. 10 and Rs. 14 per kilo for tomatoes, says B. Babu, Deputy Director, Horticulture Department, Rangareddy.At the Rythu Bazaar in Mehdipatnam, the buzz begins early in the morning with farmers bringing their produce in wicker baskets or neatly packed in colourful plastic tubs. At around 9 a.m., the estate officer goes and with a piece of chalk, marks the prices on the green signboard. It sets off a noisy cacophony as the farmers and traders begin an earnest conversation. As the shoppers troop in, it is business time as the farmers disappear and the traders take charge. I have been bringing my vegetables from Chevella for the past five years. I dont remember getting more than Rs. 10 per kilo for tomatoes. Sometimes, I have sold by number of baskets without being aware of the number of kilos, says Bharat Reddy, who cultivates tomatoes on his one-acre patch.Farm labourThe near-flat vegetable prices have had their impact on farm labour as well, as can been seen from a recent Reserve Bank of India paper Rural Wage Dynamics in India: What Role does Inflation Play? It used farm and non-farm wages as a take off point: There has been a sustained sluggishness in rural wage growth in the more recent period (post 2012-13), with the fall in agricultural wage growth being higher than non-agricultural wages.For agriculture produce, even the cost is not being covered. Last year, there was big buzz about chilli prices. Indias contribution to the world chilli production is 37% with the two Telugu states contributing 57%. The output per acre has remained constant and the sale price has also remained constant for most vegetables aggravating farm sector distress, says Sarampally Malla Reddy of All India Kisan Sabha.Wholesale prices are being dictated by six big corporates who are able to control the price as they are the main canalising agencies for both import and export of agricultural produce, says Mr. Reddy.The low prices has also meant that the farmers are being left to their own devices as they can no longer afford to purchase inputs required to raise farm output. Tomato seeds cost Rs. 1 lakh per kilo. Farmers who cannot afford these are using old seeds for growing their crops. This is further lowering the yield. While the farm inputs have kept pace with inflation rising steadily, the price that the farmers are getting has not. This is leading to farm distress, reducing farmers to subsistence level, says Narasimha Reddy Donthi, an agriculture policy expert."

With the fishing ban in place, you can find them clinging to the boats as well now.Fishermen like Gurumoorthi, 30, who are good at diving, make some extra money using their skills to remain under water for extended periods.There are different kinds of mussels and all of them taste great if you use some chicken masala for cooking. The cleaning takes some skill. If it is not done properly, you will end up with a stomach ache, he said, shivering due to the cold water. Mr. Gurumoorthi cooks mussels and also scrapes them from their hiding places. Pressure cook them for a whistle and they will open up. Retain only the soft flesh, make some masala with tomatoes, onion, turmeric powder, garlic and ginger and add the flesh to it, he explained.Oxygen tanksA 50 kg bag of mussels is sold to exporters and hoteliers for Rs. 6,500, for which he and his father Devarajan, 57, spend a few hours in the water. If someone wants just a few, we dont use oxygen tanks and other equipment. But if it is going to be a bagful, then we take enough precautions, explained Mr. Devarajan. However, since there is no regulation and anyone who can dive can get the mussels, there are divers from Thoothukudi who come here on a regular basis and scrap whatever they can, leaving almost nothing for local divers.M.D. Dayalan of the Indian Fishermen Association said that if the Chennai Port Trust permits, mussels can be grown in the fishing harbour using coir ropes and cotton cloth.It would be a good livelihood option for fishermen, at least those who depend on traditional craft. Already mussels are grown in backwaters and in estuaries, he pointed out.There are different kinds of mussels and all of them taste great if you use some chicken masala for cooking"

Most of the villages in these mandals are rainfed and farmers are forced to depend on irrigation water sources.The State government sanctioned NTR Jalasiri Phase II programme in the financial year 2016-17 for small and marginal farmers where additional groundwater recharge is available. The programme essentially focusses on utilisation of available groundwater resources and to promote conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater duly adhering to the norms mentioned under the A.P. Water, Land and Trees Act-2002.Mallisala village of Jaggampeta mandal is rainfed and in upland areas and dependent on the irrigation water tanks with meagre irrigation water sources. Only sago, mango and cashew is grown by farmers in this region. All the wage seekers in the village are developing the natural resources, hereby increasing their standard of living with the wages earned through NREGS.Success storiesTirri Ramu, a 60-year-old farmer in Mallisala, with a land holding of three acres, mostly depends on seasonal rain, and grows mango and cashew. He dug a borewell and connected a solar pump to it at a cost of Rs. 25,000 against the original price of Rs. 4.5 lakh. He has grown about 250 mango plants, cashew and tomato as intercrop for the past two years. His income incresaed from Rs. 30, 000 to Rs. 80, 000 per annum.Farmers of Korukonda are another example of the success of NTR Jalasiri programme where the yield from paddy has almost doubled.Surampudi Narasimha Murthy, a poor farmer having three acres of land, was getting only 10 to 15 bags per acre as the area is rainfed and also upland area. Project Director of District Water Management Authority (DWMA) G. Rajakumari said that when Mr. Murthy approached them, the authority offered solar-based borewell for Rs. 25,000 by giving a subsidy of Rs. 4.25 lakh.Field staff of DWMA and local NREGS installed borewell and solar panels in Mr. Murthys paddy field last year. This year, the yield has almost doubled to 30 bags. Last year, I got only 15 bags in my field and because of solar pumpset this year, I got 30 bags of paddy with which I am so happy, Mr. Murthy added."

Her mirchi ka salan, made with de-seeded large green chillies and cooked in a gravy of peanut, sesame, coconut, poppy seeds and ginger-garlic paste, made for a spicy yet creamy delicacy.Noor Khans lal mich qeema was a quick-selling dish. The founder of the home food festival, Khan, a vegetarian, said she developed the recipe 10 years ago as an experiment.Rashid Husain, the only male participant, brought to the festival his mothers mutton yakhni pulao.Beyond Awadhi food was the Bundeli Thali, consisting of a potato-tomato curry that had its own fan following. Set up by NGO Apni Rasoi of Chitrakoot, all work here is done by the women from the rural region. Usha, who was at the stall, said, Our sabzi uses very little oil and spices. Because of poverty in Bundelkhand, this has become the way of life. Our NGOs aim is to help women feel that their work of cooking can also earn them money, she said.Empowering women is actually the theme of the festival. None of our home cooks does this commercially.

The PMs irrigation schemes are helping farmers. We work to reform, perform and transform. We will solve every small problem you face, Modi said.The PM also said that farmers who grow vegetables and fruits like tomatoes, onions and potatoes (TOP) are the priority of the government. You all know how people used to wait in queues for urea, they even faced lathis. Urea is a portfolio handled by this citys son (H N Ananth Kumar).

Spandana is in charge of social media outreach for the Congress.The BJP wasn't happy with her comment, assuming she was referring to a hallucinogenic plant.""Most people of the country and our party members won't even know what you are referring to (including PM himself) but your Leader will connect with it instantly.

He wondered whether Congress president Rahul Gandhi would suspend her like he did senior leader Mani Shankar Aiyar. The Congress suspended Aiyar from the party for using the word ""neech"" in a comment aimed at PM Modi during the Gujarat Assembly polls.Malviya, though, didn't 'tag' Spandana on Twitter, and the latter wondered if it was because those who follow him on the microblogging site would see her videos about PM Modi.""You didn't want to tag me cos you didn't want people to watch the Modi video pinned on my timeline?"" she said.Spandana also wondered - a mite disingenuously - what all the fuss was about, saying ""POT"" merely meant ""Potato, Onion, Tomato"".""Come on!

Its IT wing head Malviya said more than 3,500 farmers have committed suicide in Karnataka, the highest for any state in India, but ""speaking for them is being on 'POT'...

The Gujarat government also sought information about the government of Indias recent budget announcement to provide an MSP of 1.5 times input cost, to include such a scheme in the state budget as well. After the partys near rout in rural areas in the 2017 assembly elections, the party has become sensitive to farmers issues. The Rupani government is planning a series of actions to address agrarian problems.A senior government officer privy to the development said, The state government has decided to adopt a new scheme for farmers to provide a reasonable MSP, as has been implemented in Madhya Pradesh and Telangana. The Madhya Pradesh government has a Bhavantar scheme for farmers, under which farmers get the difference between the market price and MSP directly in their account and they can sell directly at market price. So the government does not need to buy and store it as do today, in the case of groundnut. A lot of government resources will be saved on hiring godowns and using the produce later.The government is also considering a new scheme like in Telangana, where the government provides part of the input cost to farmers before sowing. The third option is a hybrid of the Madhya Pradesh and Telangana models, to suit Gujarats needs. The government is waiting for a response from GOI. In case of a delay from GOI, the state government has decided to opt for both the models. We have also contacted Niti Aayog, which is working on a new country-wide formula for MSP, the source added."

According to Patanjali officials, the first units of the 234-acre food park in non-SEZ area will be commissioned in July this year and the first of the three plants will become fully operational in December. Work on food park in SEZ area and a third plant of ayurvedic products in non-SEZ area will start very soon. The first unit will process oranges.After taking over the food park land, the company had announced it will provide direct jobs to 10,000 people when all the three plants become functional. The first plant is expected to generate direct employment for 2,000 by December, said Patanjali officials.TOI visited the food park on Wednesday to find machinery worth hundreds of crores kept in the non-SEZ food park. The basic frame of the first plant made up of PEB (pre-erected building) has been erected. Sheets will be fixed on this structure to create walls of the plant. About 80% of the civil work will be completed by June.Sunil Gupta, senior general manager of Patanjali, said that about 85% of the machinery has been procured. The remaining machinery will be purchased when we are about to commission the plant. A large percentage of this machinery has been imported, he told TOI. Gupta further said that the company was investing Rs1,200 crore in the non-SEZ food park. This includes civil work, machinery, land cost, etc, he added.According to the official, Patanjali will manufacture a large number of products in the food park for domestic market. They include fruit juice, Indian gooseberry (aonla) candy, murabba (pickle), digestive tablets, hops, wheat flour, biscuits, ayurvedic juices, jams, ketchups and sharbats, he told TOI.Commenting on the capacity of the plant, he said, We will use 800 tonne oranges a day, 600 tonne of Indian gooseberry and 400 tonne of other fruits and vegetables like tomato, mango, bottle gourd (lauki), bitter gourd (karela), etc, each.The plant will be zero waste factory. Fruits and vegetables will be utilized 100%. Value added products will be made from the waste and rest will be fed to the boiler. For example we will make cosmetics and green tea from orange peel. We will also manufacture orange oil. The pomace will be fed to the boiler, Gupta said.The plant will also have zero liquid discharge. We will recycle the whole water we use. Costly machinery has been purchased for this purpose, the senior GM further said. Bhoomipujan of the food park was performed in September 2016 and production was expected to start in six months. The project was delayed due to a variety of reasons."

The dairy is currently paying Rs 570 per kg fat. Rajkot Dairy has also reduced the price by Rs 40 per kg fat in last one month and is currently paying Rs 540.Sarhad Dairy chairman Valji Humbal said, We are only following GCMMFs steps in price reduction. On February 8, prices will be further cut, but we wont reduce immediately. We will see how much we can pay. Otherwise, we have to reduce Rs 10 per kg fat more.The dairy procures 5 lakh litre per day (LLPD) from 50,000 farmers while Kutch produces 10 LLPD. Rajkot Dairy procures 4.75 LLPD milk.This year, GCMMF had received 22% more milk in terms of volume compared to last year. A month ago, GCMMF warned all its 17 milk producers unions not to procure extra milk. As a result, dairies across the state stopped registering new members. Rajkot Dairy has put one-day off in rotation every week as far as milk procurement is concerned in each of its 14 talukas.Dhiru Gandhi, a milk producer from Rapar in Kutch, said The dairy has already capped milk procurement and is now reducing the price of fat continuously. We have no option but to sell the milk to dairy because it is a perishable commodity and we cant store it. Private players also exploit by giving us low prices.Though the problem of surplus milk crops up every winter, this time the situation is more acute because of the drastic fall in price of skimmed milk powder (SMP). The production cost of 1kg SMP is Rs 240 while the market price is Rs 150 to Rs 160, which is why private players have stopped buying milk.GCMMF managing director R S Sodhi said, Surplus milk is a problem but we are paying more to farmers compared to last year. We have reduced a small amount but some dairies have reduced more than that. Milk comes in huge quantity and to restrict inflow they might have chosen more reduction. We expect demand to rise in summer.Dr B B Savalia, assistant research scientist of cattle breading farm at Junagadh Agriculture University (JAU), said Milk production will come down by 30% in summer while demand will rise. Therefore, the present problem wont escalate. Its a temporary phenomenon."

However, economists expect that the central bank would move to a more hawkish stance from the current neutral stance in the wake of growth bottoming out.We continue to expect the RBI to persist with its slightly hawkish pause in its Wednesday policy, from February, to err on the side of caution. That said, falling onion prices, after tomatoes, support our call that inflation risks are overdone, said Indranil Sen Gupta, economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch . According to Gupta, the MPC will see through the coming jump in inflation, growth and credit in mid-2018 as they are driven by base effects.Even without the central bank raising rates, lenders cost of funds has inched up as deposits slowed down and credit grew at a one-year high. Several large lenders, including State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank have hiked their bulk deposit rates. Private lender Axis Bank has also hiked its marginal cost of lending rate ( MCLR ) following an increase in cost of funds.According to DBS Bank chief economist Taimur Baig, growth has largely bottomed out, but India has yet to benefit from the synchronised pickup in global demand. The combination of fiscal challenges and rising oil prices would make the RBIs policy path a tricky one this year, in our view. Given Indias high debt and fiscal deficit, it may not be prudent to be on the sideline until inflation pressure becomes excessively high which, in turn, means the balance of risk is beginning to shift toward eventual policy tightening, he said.One of the factors that strengthen the case for a more hawkish regime has been the Union Budget , which unveiled a wider than expected fiscal deficit for the next year. But economists feel that the slippage is not enough to warrant a move to higher interest rates.Nomura economist Sonal Varma said, While the Budget is a slight disappointment relative to our expectations, it is not a game-changer in either direction  positive or negative. We expect a prolonged pause on monetary policy, including at the upcoming February 7 meeting, although the RBI may flag upside risks to inflation. She added that Nomura is yet to assess the impact of the government decision to hike minimum support prices (MSPs) on inflation and monetary policy outlook. The government has promised to increase the MSPs for crops by 1.5 times in the Budget.Benchmark 10-year bond yields have risen more than 80 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) since July  the biggest move since the 2013 rupee crisis, due in large part to worries about a more hawkish RBI."

When politicians trade barbs and innuendo on social networking sites, it translates to business as usual. The key is to inform voters, not rabble-rouse or flood them with babble. Politicians not only need to broadcast their views, but also listen to their voters. And that should be done intelligently.BENGALURU: The Congress on Monday distanced itself from its social media head Divya Spandanas controversial tweet that made a derogatory and personal attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi , soon after she came under flak.Divya alias Ramya, former Mandya MP, had on Sunday taken a dig at Modi, wondering if he was on pot (cannabis), a putdown which invited sharp criticism. The actor-turned-politicians swipe came following Modis comment at a rally here, during which he said farmers were his top priority and described TOP as tomato, onion and potato. Is this what happens when youre on POT? she tweeted.Reacting to the pot jibe, chief minister Siddaramaiah said he is not aware of the tweet, but character assassination of any individual was not right.I have countered Modis allegations point-by-point against our government, but refrained from making any personal attack. He may be our political rival, but I will not speak disrespectfully of the PM personally. We are in a federal structure. We have accepted the Constitution. We have to run the government in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. We cant go against it. We are not the BJP to go against the Constitution, he said.Hitting out at Ramya, BJPs IT cell head Amit Malviya tweeted: In Karnataka, more than 3,500 farmers have committed suicide under @ siddaramaiahs watch, highest for any state in India but speaking for them is being on POT...Congress keeps it classy, again...And in another tweet: Will Rahul Gandhi maintain silence on Divya Spandanas comment while he sacked Mani Shankar Aiyar just because his jibe came close to Gujarat election and Karnataka is still some months away? Or sacrificing his close aide, responsible for his rise as a leader, takes some courage?To this Ramya replied: Single Meaning plz ! Share it with those who have understood.

Farmers of some crops have sustained losses, and there was little that the government could do as it was difficult to have a regulatory policy for each and every crop, said the APMC.Vegetable supplies at the APMC wholesale market this winter has doubled. The daily supply is pegged at 70-80 tonnes comprising some 600 vehicles  a mix of trucks and tempos. The crop has been better in the last two years, said Shivaji Pahinkar, APMC Mumbai secretary. The APMC comes under the agriculture and marketing department of the state government. Farmers growing tomato, brinjal and leafy vegetables are reported to have sustained losses, said the APMC. The loss is also on account of flooding of the market with farm produce from neigbouring states and farmers having to sell the stock cheap in view of increased supplies.Broccoli is largely supplied from Karnataka, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. Wholesale prices have plummeted while retailers have pocketed the benefit. Pahinkar added, There is very little that the government can do to contain the crash while there is no mechanism to control the retail trade. This year, the overall crop production has been good in the country. Pahinkar reasoned that it was difficult for the government to intervene into each and every crop, and so the government could do little to contain the fall in price, but if there was a concerted step by all state governments then the supplies could be regulated. A micro level planning will also be required as in what to sow and when besides more food processing units to match demand and supply, he said."

There has been a delay in price drop this year because of the unseasonal rains in November-December 2017. The rains had damaged vegetables in the fields and it took some time for the supplies to normalize, he said.However, the predicted spell of unseasonal rain, hail and thunderstorm is a cause for worry. Khaire said after such weather events, the vegetable prices tend to go up because of damage to standing crops.Even Arundhati Sharma, a housewife, does not expect the low prices to continue. As soon as the prices fall, we hear of something or the other that can cause a rise again, she said."

This Valentines Day , we share the tales of togetherness from six such couples for whom neither the colour of their passports nor the flavour of their cuisine mattered as much as that overpowering, magical emotion called love.Over the years, many a foreign tourist has visited Vijay Kumars tattoo studio at Fort Kochi. But when Natalia from Russia walked in, on a lovely January evening last year, it was a never-before moment. She took away Vijay Kumar's heart and their love blossomed into marriage in November, last year!He describes that first meeting: Natalia visited my studio out of curiosity, not to get a tattoo done. But when we met, something magical happened. Her simplicity and soft-spoken nature struck me.For Natalia, who was working as a manager of a company in Russia, it was her first trip to India. I remember the day I met my husband, vividly. I was at the hotel near his studio for dinner. Seeing the sign board of the studio, I went in, and there he was, she says. The gentle, open minded and kind-hearted Vijay Kumar won her heart in no time. He also has a subtle sense of humour, which I liked very much, she fondly recalls.Natalia returned to Russia by January end, but the duo kept in touch. We used to call and text every day, during breaks and after her office time. I realised how she was perfect for me. I am a simple Fort Kochi man, not someone who leads an adipoli life full of alcohol and cigarettes. Natalia shares my views and understands me. When she said she was ready to marry me and settle down here, I knew it was truly special, Vijay Kumar says.Natalia came back again in July. In September, they registered their marriage and had the wedding ceremony in November. She makes great dosa, idly, tomato rice and other Indian dishes, he compliments Natalia. She adds, Its his mother who taught me to cook them. But I am yet to learn complicated dishes. A vegetarian, she names chilly gobi, chilly paneer and dal as her favourite foods.Does she miss Russia? Well, when I do, I can probably ask my husband to take me to Munnar, Natalia says. I am in touch with my family through internet and have asked them to make their next trip to Kerala. Once we save some money, Vijay and I would make our first trip to Russia together.Music composer Rahul Raj says it was love at first sight when he met Miriam Merkle from Germany for the first time. She had flown down to Kerala to study at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeethams Amritapuri campus in Kollam. It was her great love for Indian culture that made her take up this course. Rahul was a routine visitor at Amritapuri campus as part of his music assignments and he had seen her there once.She was my Orkut friend at that time and I was surprised when she sent a message  Rahul Chettaa, I have heard your compositions and they are very nice, says Rahul. Thus we became friends and fell in love later. We got married in May 2008, after five months of knowing each other. My mother was a little worried that I was marrying a western girl; she was doubtful if my non-Indian wife would be able to adopt our culture and systems. But they are now more like mother and daughter and Miriam is very fluent in Malayalam. She was very keen to understand our rituals including pujas that we perform at our houses. She is a homemaker but for me, she is a wonder woman who takes care of everything at home including my mothers health. Our daughter Akshainie Leiyas name is a blend of German and Indian cultures. For us, Valentines Day is another ordinary day. We love enjoying the ordinary days and celebrate our ordinary life which is the happiest thing for Miriam and me.Irina Antonova, 30, first connected with Paul Skaria on a social media platform in November 2010. They chatted generally on travelling, personal development and Russian history in which Paul took a lot of interest. They later lost touch and did not speak for years but the connection was reignited after Irina posted a photo from London in November 2013. Paul was working in that city then and they spent several days together and developed a strong bonding.In 2015, Paul invited her to his home in India where he introduced her to his parents and proposed to her. In July 2015, they registered their marriage in Kochi.Says Irina: I remember that day vividly because it was an unforgettable experience not only because I was the bride but also because I was getting married in another country. It was in a beautiful church not far from our home. Some traditions and customs were new but there were no major differences because we both belong to the Orthodox church. I was dressed in a white wedding gown which I brought from Moscow while Paul wore a black suit. Later, I changed to a sari and I felt like an oriental princess.The couple are now settled in Kochi. She adds: We communicate in English, so there is no language barrier between us. Of course, there are some differences but it is natural. Ive learned to respect other peoples views and opinions more and to understand the values of another culture, to think in new ways and to take new decisions. Ive started to understand myself and others better. Along with exploring a new culture I understood my own culture deeper.She remembers that on their first Valentines Day after marriage, Paul gifted her some awesome jewellery and she gave him a palette with their photos. But we have 365 days in a year when everyone gets a chance to say I love you to their beloved and family members.""Avithal Elias Lautman describes her love story as a very nerdy one. She jokes that all her life, she prayed for a chance to study in IIT but God laughed and sent her to an IIT outside India. So, it was when both she and Ronen Shmuel Lautman were students of the Israel Institute of Technology that they met at a Diwali party organised by Avithal, a jew from Kochi. He loved my channa masala and we kept bumping into each other since then. He even came for my thesis defence. He was always too shy to ask me out, even though it was obvious he liked me, she says.Before one New Year's Eve, Avithal mustered the courage to ask him out, encouraged by her best friend Sara. Luckily, he didn't have any plans. We went out for our first date on New Years Eve, and we talked the whole night. It was very romantic. I couldnt wait to see him again. We made plans to have dinner the next night, and the rest is history. They got married on October 5, 2015, and are settled in Haifa, Israel.She continues: We embraced each others cultural differences, including food and family traditions. It was easy for us as we wanted more or less the same things from life and shared ideas about money, food, lifestyle and religion. Our parents were more excited and welcoming than we thought. His family never ever made me feel uncomfortable because of who I was. And my mom was always understanding with Ronens PDA. Also we never made fun of each others culture, but we did fight over the space agencies. Also he started eating with hands and learning Malayalam. I have already taught him to say, ente bharya sundariya. And he taught me how to eat with chopsticks. We love each more because of the cultural differences.She adds: On Valentines Day, we usually avoid restaurants as it can get crowded. We do make special food that day. It is usually only the two of us and that might include walks on beaches and a really good dinner.We do tell every now and then how we appreciate each other for being there always and we do not wait for a special day to say I love you.They met first in Dhaka where Ganga Nimmy Jose Cheripuram was associated with a bank and looking for a renewable energy project for rural India through micro finance and Johannes Fischbeck was a manager in a German firm that provided energy solutions to the developing world.My first impression of Joe was not so romantic as he was very reserved. If somebody would have told me then that he would be the man I was going to marry, I would have ran away at that moment itself, says Ganga. He, however, was impressed with her socialising.The long car rides in the next three weeks changed the equations drastically. We talked about our personal lives and realised that though representing vastly different cultures, we had a lot of common views. Still, it was the shock of my life, when he, after a week, confessed me that he liked me. I turned him down but one more week later, I found myself liking him too.Soon it was time to part ways. Joe went to Tanzania for another project while Ganga returned to Kerala. Mails and skype followed, not all of it official.Three months later, they decided to get married. For Joe, it was a bit strange to marry a girl whom he knew for such a short period but getting married was the only way to be together. Luckily, it was not so difficult to convince my family, says Ganga.Six months after their first meeting, Joe came down to Kochi with his parents and best friend. The Germans were astonished to see the 500-strong crowd while the Indians thought it to be a modest wedding. Joe still complains about the 300 photographs for which he was forced to smile.Ganga joined him in Berlin and found that language was a major barrier. There were other barriers too. We are so different. Introvert to extrovert, writer to talker, reader to cook, musician to gardener, cycling to watching movies...We never share any hobbies. But then, we really compliment each other. We do all our holidays to household works together.Daughter Emma was born in India and they stayed on in Kochi. So Joe started working as a renewable energy consultant in Kochi and I started a small business that deals with landscaping and terrariums. We enjoyed every moment of our six years in Kochi with lots of fun and fellowship.She adds: When it is time for Emma to start schooling, we came back to Germany and settled here now. In Joe's words, I am living physically here and mentally in Kerala. I continue my business in Kochi and am very well updated on all happenings in Kerala."

The immediate fallout of the strike was felt in the retail vegetable markets of the capital where veggie prices witnessed a rising trend. Moreover, the mandi board has incurred a loss of about Rs 2.5 lakh.Secretary of the traders association of fruits and vegetables Rajendra Saini termed the auction of parking lots as illegal and said nowhere in Madhya Pradesh farmers and traders pay for parking. The strike will continue till the mandi administration withdraws its orders, he said. He alleged that henchmen of contractors also extort money in the name of parking fees.As no farmer turned up in the mandi with his produce, the vegetable rates have started climbing in the retail markets. Besides, rates of fruits have also gone up. Saini said, Tomato, which was priced at Rs 10 a kg in retail before the strike is now being sold at many markets at Rs 20 per kg. Green chillies prices have gone up to Rs 50 to Rs 60 a kg. As far as fruits are concerned, papaya is being sold for Rs 30 a kg, almost Rs 10 up from yesterdays price.Achche Miyan, a retailer in New Market, said: Rates of fruits and vegetables in the city are likely to go up further if the mandi strike continues. There was already a shortage of commodities on Thursday.Joint director of mandi Ritu Chouhan urged the traders to end their agitation. She said she has directed mandi secretary Vinay Pateria to resolve the issue. However, the traders meeting with Chouhan on Thursday afternoon did not yield any result and the strike is likely to continue on Friday as well."
5b16731b9855b76a5f1a5ebf,Bumper tomato crop leaves farmers in red,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bumper-tomato-crop-leaves-farmers-in-red/articleshow/62942078.cms,2018-02-16,,The Times Of India,"BHOPAL: A bumper tomato crop in Madhya Pradesh and ban on its export to Pakistan have sent prices plummeting in the state, putting farmers on the edge of a fresh crisis.The government, which is already scrambling to tackle the massive crop damage from unseasonal hailstorms, now faces a challenge that is not covered by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhans recent assurances to farmers.With tomato selling for a mere Rs 2-3/kg at many places, many farmers are forced to let their crop rot in the fields since the price doesnt even cover the cost of plucking and transportation. The administration, however, feels its not at crisis level because tomato is a multipleharvest crop.Mahendra Singh, the biggest tomato farmer in Kolaras of Shivpuri  one of the three districts that produce the crop  said: A crate carrying about 25-30kg of tomato is being sold for Rs 60 to Rs 75. This is too little. The cost of growing the crop is about Rs 3.5/kg per hectare of land, which is why farmers in Shivpuri, where the best quality tomatoes are produced, are incurring huge losses. Kolaras has assembly bypoll on February 24.Earlier,10,000-oddcrates of tomato used to be sent to Pakistan, said Singh. But the export has been stopped. Now we are sending only to Nepal, and that too only about 5% of what used to be sold in the past. The surplus tomato is now being sold at a throw away prices, he added.Another big tomato grower, B P Dhakad of Ratlam, told TOI, At the moment, tomato is being sold in Pakistan at Rs 100-150 because the Centre has stopped export. The shelf life of our tomato is 3 to 4 days and in this period the yield can be sent to Pakistan only, a country with huge consumption of the vegetable.There are reports from Khargone and Badwani of farmers destroying their yield in the farms itself. Things may worsen in other parts of the state, said Shivpuris Mahendra Singh Horticulture director Satyanand doesnt agree. Tomato is a multipleplucking crop and farmers sometime sell their yield at Rs 40 a kg. Had they been incurring losses, they would have stopped cultivating tomato, he said.About governments plan to establish food processing units to utilise the yield, he said, We are still hopeful. But it is a risky business. Investors are scared that farmers may shift to other crops. Food processing plants are yield specific. A plant installed for tomato cannot process any other vegetable."

Last month, the price of the vegetable was around Rs 30  35 per kg. Traders at the Gandhi market in the city stated that the fall in price was mainly owing to the increase in supply and lower demand.At a time when selling one bundle of cabbage itself is a big task and we are provided with two or three more bundles, it is only obvious that we have to decrease the price to sell them off, said R Loganathan , who works at a vegetable shop at Gandhi Market.Cabbages mostly come from Bengaluru and the supply has increased significantly over the last few weeks, he added. We dont sell the unsold cabbages the next day, so it is absolutely crucial that we reduce the price so that we dont incur losses, he added.Other reasons for the fall in prices of vegetables are the cultivation trends of farmers and increase in number of markets in the city, claim a few traders.M Thangamani, manager at V S Karuppaiah vegetable shop at Gandhi market, said that many farmers cultivate a particular crop which would be highly priced at that point of time. Take tomato for example, if the price of the vegetable is high, every farmer starts to cultivate it, which eventually results in bigger supply and lower price, he said.Several traders had also predicted that the price of cabbage would increase again in a couple of weeks. It is not the case only with cabbage  any vegetable which is sold at a steep price would have a drastic fall in the following month. Its a cycle, Loganathan said, adding, For instance, coriander, which was sold for only Rs 5-6 per kg last month, is now being sold at Rs 15-16 a kg."

When the price dropped to Rs. 3 a kilogram for tomato, farmers had left the crop unplucked. Some of them dumped heaps of ripe tomatoes by the road when they failed to get a price that would at least cover the labour cost.Kerala is the main market for the crop produced in the border villages. In the main vegetable market at Udumalpet in Tamil Nadu, farmers had to sell a 14-kg box of tomatoes for Rs. 20. The cost of plucking 14 kg alone is estimated at Rs. 10. Hence they find plucking the crop pointless.Rs. 20 in IdukkiThe same crop is charged Rs. 10 to 15 at the market at Marayur, in Idukki district, nearly 40 km from Udumalpet. In other areas of Idukki, the price is Rs. 20 or above.Market sources said tomato prices nosedived following a bumper production on the border villages, facilitated by the use of high quality seeds and a favourable climate there. They cultivated varieties such as 5005, US1, and US3. The demand for tomatoes in Kerala has not dwindled, but it is not high enough to absorb this added production. Last year, the price was almost 30% higher at the time of harvest.Boxes of tomatoes are left unsold at the Udumalpet market, which, along with Ottanchatram and Pollachi, is the main vegetable market near the border in Tamil Nadu. At Uralpatti, Edayamuthur, and Kannamanaickanur, tonnes of ripe tomatoes were found unplucked on the farms. The crop is mostly cultivated at Gudimangalam, Pethappampatti, Pollavadi, and Kurichikottai villages of Tirupur and Kumaralingam and Palani valleys of Tamil Nadu from October to January. In 45 days, it will yield fruit. In the cool-season vegetable producing villages of Kanthallur and Vattavada in Kerala, tomato is not cultivated now. It was cultivated earlier, but with poor availability of water and change in climatic conditions, farmers slowly shifted to other vegetables, said a farmer at Kanthallur."

Their own fields were their labs, as they put into practice what they gleaned from their textbooks.Some of the budding agriculturalists not only tweaked farming practices in their fields, but also helped transform their villages.In Kolar, farmers tend to grow lots of tomato. Between 2012 and 2014, we suffered losses and could not even meet the cost of cultivation, said Udaykumar K.S., who hails from Mallasandra in Kolar district, and earned an M.Sc. in agricultural economics.He convinced his parents to incorporate an integrated farming system. Now we grow potatoes, tomatoes, and cauliflower based on the season, and we are able to make a profit, he said.This prompted several other farmers in his village to follow their footsteps. Udaykumar won seven medals and plans to further specialise in agricultural economics, with the aim of encouraging entrepreneurship among farmers.Integrated farmingChaitra G.J. of Gopikunte in Sira taluk of Tumakuru district, who completed a doctorate in agriculture extension, persuaded her father to shift from mono-cropping to integrated farming in 2016. Two of my siblings are engineers. My father is proud that I have chosen this subject. As I come from a family of farmers, I got hands-on experience and observed the different practices adopted on our land, she said.It was not easy for all students to convince their families, steeped in age-old farming practices, to experiment.Yashika M.P. from Bellumadu, near Virajpet in Kodagu district, earned an M.Sc. in sericulture and bagged three gold medals. Over the past year, she has been trying to promote organic farming back home. It took a lot of convincing, as organic farming is a slow process. It will take another two years to see the results, but I am optimistic, she said.H.B. Manoj Kumar of Haniyambadi in Mandya district, who took a doctorate in plant biotechnology, was devastated after the paddy crop in his fields was infected with disease. He took the tragedy as a challenge. I learnt more about the disease and the precautionary measures that can be taken to protect crops from getting affected.

So who is making money? he questioned.He also demanded the release of arrears from sugar factories. Five factories have not paid arrears to farmers. The State government should force them to pay arrears with 18 % interest. They submitted a memorandum to Additional Deputy Commissioner Suresh Itnal who promised to look into the matter.Mayanna, Raju Rajai and Raju Kaganikar were present on the occasion."

Maybe this is because there are quite a few things that Ive refused to put in my mouth. Over the years its become a perverse fascination of mine to see what other people hate to eat. Perhaps this started when, as a kid, I developed a deep disgust for ghee  not a good aberration in a child with a Gujarati Vaishnav background. Well into adulthood I would recoil at any sight of ghee, whether it was being put in diyas for puja, spread on thin Gujju rotis or some mother/aunt-type culinary sergeant was attempting to sully my precious aamras with a drizzle of this melted hell-produce. My mom was unmoved and caustically pointed out the sheer idiocy of my attempting a ghee-mukt diet: You lovemagas(a typical Gujarati sweet) and it is full of ghee! Or: You love your Punjabi food and a lot of it is made with ghee! (A really sore point for her was not that I liked Punjabi vegetarian grub but that I ranked it on par with Gujju food.) My point was, as long as I couldnt see it, it was fine, but the visuals were intolerable, setting off a chain of retching in my throat.Food phobiasI was a weird kid. I hated ghee, rice andbaingan, but I lovedkarelaand the umami of vaal ni daal . Of my two sons, the older one decided at the advanced age of three to keep his fathers perversity but not for the same food. For the longest time I couldnt put any tomato-based product in front of him, namely, anything in which you could discern the offending red fruit. Would he eat pizza? Ye-es. Not as enthusiastically as other kids but he would eat it. Pasta sauce with tomato elements? Yes, as long as it was paste. Tomato salad? No way. Ketchup? No, wed have violence if there was any on the table.Then there is a friend of mine, S, a Gujju and a food lover from the same background as mine, for whom the kryptonite effect comes from just seeing coriander. Again, this is extreme cultural treason from a Gujju, but there it is. Forget about actual cilantro, we friends can torture him simply by posting photos of the green stuff on his Facebook page. How can a Gujju not love kothmir ? people ask him. S just smiles and says: But I love fish like a Bengali! At one point, S explained to me with the aid of a scientific website how the leaf actually sets off a semi-allergic reaction in him. Again, if he cant see it or smell it, hes fine. So no chopped coriander on his dhoklas, but if I use it as part of a paste in a daal hell eat it happily.Speaking of cultural traitors, people who know Im into food often ask me about the fact that I wont eat anything that has had any activity in water. People who dont know me well often ask: What kind of a Bengali doesnt love fish? My answer is simple: Im not a Bengali. I may have sloughed off my strict vegetarian upbringing, I may revel in eating all sorts of meat (yes, that kind and also that other kind), but this Pesciphobia is perhaps a remaining trace of my core childhood. Next question: How can you be a foodie and not explore seafood? A shifty Lefty once said: Im not a Marxist but Im a student of Marx. My reply goes: Im not a foodie but a spectator of foodie-ism. Which, of course, brings me to my Bong foodie friend who also doesnt much like fish. This friend, N, has even made a long documentary about Bengalis and fish, and he will lecture you knowledgeably about all the thousand varieties of fish available in the delta and how Bengalis of different persuasion (Ghoti or Bangal) like to cook them, but he will rarely touch the slippery suspects himself.Phobias shiftThe thing Ive noticed about these phobias is that they shift. Today, Son No. 1 is a reasonably good cook and he even uses tomatoes sometimes, though you can still get him to comply to demands by waving a bottle of ketchup. N is gradually beginning to include fish in his cooking repertoire, even though he himself barely eats it. Another friend, who used to find European cheese difficult to comprehend, is now, under direct pressure from a romantic and emotional direction, starting to discuss the joys of chvre, brie, pecorino and manchego. The other day, I found myself at a new restaurant trying and really liking some beautifully cooked crustaceans, lobsterish white pulp, glittering black eggs and all. Well before that, I discovered the joys of proper, naked ghee, the nice one my local milk-wala makes, the beautifully fragrant variety you get from Mysore, and even the superb organic one produced at a farm in Suffolk that costs 10 for a small jar. As N has demonstrated to me, decent ghee is central to a first course in Bong food, mixed with plain, hot rice plus some crisp, bitter element such as karela , thus creating a dtente between what Ive always loved and till recently hated. Does this mean I foresee S soon relishing a crown of coriander on a ceviche? No, that may take some time, but S has promised that the day a certain other pair of Gujaratis are forced to loosen their grip on power, he will eat something with a garnish of kothmir."

The price of vegetables in wholesale markets, and uzhavar santhai are fixed based on the arrival of stock and the prevailing demand.The price of vegetables has been coming down in the last few weeks.Normally, the prices go up during marriage season, and other festival days.The price of small onion has fallen from Rs. 180 a kg in December last to about Rs. 24 in uzhavar santhai on Monday.The price of tomato stood at Rs. 7 a kg; brinjal about Rs. 14; ladys finger Rs. 24; potato Rs. 20; snake gourd Rs. 10; broad beans Rs. 14; cluster beans Rs. 20; bitter gourd Rs. 16; green chilli Rs. 16; Bellary onion Rs. 27; cabbage Rs. 12; carrot Rs. 30; and radish Rs. 6.The price of coconuts, however, has gone up.Many consumers said that low price of vegetables will help those belonging to the weaker sections of society while conducting marriages.The farmers at Suramangalam uzhavar santhai said that the district experienced widespread rainfall by the end of last year, following which farmers had raised vegetables in a larger area. There was a spurt in vegetable production in the villages due to the availability of adequate water. The bulk arrival of all sorts of vegetables in the markets has brought down their price.The bulk arrival is expected to continue for a few more weeks, they said."

I can smell mustard oil and asafoetida, and know that some delicious Kashmiri dish is being cooked by our Kashmiri neighbours.Its a cuisine thats always been close to my heart. I like both Kashmiri Muslim and Hindu food, but I think I enjoy the latter even more than the former. The two kinds of regional food are similar  but also vastly different.I remember how thrilled I was when Chor Bizarre first opened up in Delhi in Asaf Ali Road eons ago. Since then, of course, several Kashmiri outlets  many of them catering units  have sprung up in the city. And Dilliwallahs are getting to know their gushtaba from their rista, and their nadru from their knol-knol.And, increasingly, we are discovering the differences between Pandit and Muslim food, too. What gives Kashmiri food its distinctive taste is the tempering in mustard oil of asafoetida and dried ginger, and the use of yoghurt and turmeric. Unlike the Muslim food, there is no garlic in the dishes.I had a great Kashmir Pandit meal some evenings ago at The Holiday Inn in Mayur Vihar. The coffee shop there  called Caf on 3  had a special Kashmiri food festival, organised by Rajni Jinsi, who I discovered is a great cook. The festival is over, but Jinsi runs her own outfit called Rajnis Kitchen (Ph Nos: 9899008238 and 9911469649).It was a stupendous meal  and I tried out many of the special dishes of the region, from kabargah (double-cooked lamb rack), fried fish, fried lotus stem patties to roganjosh, gosht yakhni and veth chaman, which is a dish of cottage cheese cooked with Kashmiri red chillies.What I really loved about the food was that they were all mildly spiced, yet each dish had its own characteristic taste.Contrary to popular belief, Kashmir food is not always rich. The moong dal that I had, for instance, was delightfully light and delicious. The dal had been cooked in some milk with pieces of radish, which added their own sharp taste to it.The yakhni, in yoghurt gravy, was smooth, and the Kashmiri chilli-red roganjosh was as pleasing to the eye, as to the palate. I use a lot of Kashmiri red chillies, for they add colour and a certain taste to a dish, but are not red hot. The KP roganjosh relies heavily on hing and does not use garlic, onions or tomatoes. Jinsis roganjosh was cooked with some yoghurt, dried ginger powder, fennel powder and some garam masala.I had thought I would stay away from the vegetables, but my young friend, Chef Suprabhath Roy Chowdhury (F&B director of the hotel), urged me to try out the schochal wangan  eggplant and Kashmiri haak  and I am happy he did. Tempered with dried ginger, some cloves and with the taste of tamarind in it, it was simply out of this world. What was equally delicious was the sweet rice  modur polav  which surprisingly really went well with the meat dishes.Another great aspect of Kashmiri food is the array of chutneys that come with it. There is a sharp radish chutney, a crunchy walnut one and fragrant one prepared with mint leaves.Rajnis Kitchen can cater for 15 people or so. I think she is one of the best cooks I have met in a while, and I hope the Kitchen does roaring business. Let the fires keep burning!"

With the commencement of the harvest period, the markets and godowns at Thammampatti have been receiving bulk stock of tomatoes daily.Due to the abundant availability of tomatoes, the price has nosedived for the past few weeks. The price has also gone down due to competition between people running the godowns.The price of tomatoes remained at Rs. 130 per bag containing 28 kg at Thammampatti. The price is Rs. 200 in Thalaivasal and Rs. 160 in the neighbouring Tiruchi district. As the farmers will be incurring additional expenses for transporting the harvested tomatoes to the markets and godowns, they have decided to convert the tomatoes into seeds for the next season.S. Mani, a farmer of Thammampatti, said that he spent Rs. 1,800 for the nursery for half acre land, after incurring heavy expenditure for ploughing the land, administering manure and removing the weeds.They have to pay Rs. 100 as wages for each worker for plucking 100 kg of tomatoes. They are not getting even the wages they pay to the workers from marketing the crop at present. As we will be incurring only additional expenditure by transporting the crop to the markets, we have decided to store them as seeds for next season.People involved in marketing tomato seedlings collect them in bulk from the farmers and market them to the needy farmers of other parts of the district. We are getting a little more revenue by marketing the seedlings then by selling the tomatoes, Mani says.The price of tomatoes has also fallen in the other production centres such as Mecheri and Muthunaikenpatti in the district.The price has been constantly remaining between Rs. 6 and Rs. 8 in the uzhavar santhais and other markets in the district."

MEP is the minimum price below which exporters cant export onions.The step would help in arresting crash in wholesale onion prices, which has a detrimental effect on the prices that farmers get from selling their product. The notification issued by the director general of foreign trade of Union ministry of commerce, Alok Vardhan Chaturvedi , said that MEP on all varieties of onions stands removed and can be exported without MEP.A copy of the notification is in possession of TOI. Experts said that removal of MEP is the first step towards tackling the volatility in onion prices.The Union government in its budget presented on Thursday had announced launching of Operation Greens scheme to address price fluctuations in onions, potato and tomato for benefit of farmers and consumers with budgetary allocation of Rs 500 crore for the scheme for the fiscal 2018-19.For two years since December 24, 2015 there was no MEP of on onions.However Centre re-imposed MEP on onions on November 23 last year at USD 850 per tonne. Thereafter on January 19, Centre had also reduced the MEP on onions to USD 700 per tonne.The sources from the ministry of agriculture said, During the recent meeting with the officials from the ministry of commerce, it had already been decided to remove the MEP on onions if the average wholesale onion prices dropped below Rs 2,000 per quintal. Now, the average wholesale onion prices have already dropped to Rs 1,500 per quintal. Hence, it had been immediately decided to remove the MEP of onions."

The Prime Minister likes to boast that it is much easier to do business in India now than it ever was.Indian farmers voted overwhelmingly for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2014 general election that swept him to power. He cannot count on them doing so again, as a crash in commodity prices and surging fuel costs stoke anger in the countryside.Four years ago, Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept Uttar Pradesh, Indias most populous state, winning 73 of 80 seats, as the rural poor  swayed by promises of higher crop prices  deserted the rival Congress party.Now, facing criticism for not improving living standards in the countryside, where 70 percent of Indias 1.3 billion people live, analysts and farm economists said Modi would find it hard to repeat the feat in a general election due by May 2019.While it is risky to predict election outcomes in India, where religion and caste remain important issues  not to mention the influence of fickle regional parties  interviews with some of the states millions of farmers suggest rural angst could cost the government dearly.No doubt, there was a wave for Modi in 2014, but farmers are disenchanted with him now, said sugar cane grower Uday Vir Singh, 53, plonking down on a wicker chair and smoking his hookah. Modi promised to double farmers income but our earning has halved because of his apathy and anti-farmer policies. Nearly half a dozen farmers sitting with Singh on a hand-woven rope cot, and many of others in Kairana  which elected a joint opposition candidate from a small regional party in a key by-election this week  accused Modi and the Uttar Pradesh administration, also run by the BJP, of failing to live up to their promises and overlooking the concerns of villagers.Modi is a very good salesman but we are not going to fall prey to his glib talk again, said 55-year-old Narendra Kalhande, who grows cane on his 2.5 acre farm. Farm Minister Radha Mohan Singh defended the governments record, citing initiatives on irrigation, crop insurance and electronic trading platforms for farmers to sell produce.For farmers, Prime Minister Modis 48 months have been much better than the Congresss rule of 48 years, Singh told Reuters, referring to the main opposition party that dominated Indian politics for most of the years since independence from British colonial rule in 1947.CRISIS IN COUNTRYSIDEHigher inflation and sluggish growth helped Modi trounce Congress, which had long counted the rural poor as its core constituency, in the 2014 election. Small farmers had been hit by rising living costs but benefited little from rising food prices because of the web of middlemen in Indias agricultural markets.Since then the economy has picked up, recording its quickest pace of expansion in nearly two years in the first three months of 2018, helped by higher growth in the farm sector. But lower food prices, weaker farm wages and modest crop procurement rates  the result of a shift in focus from the subsidies favoured by Congress to investment under the pro-business BJP  have hurt most of Indias 263 million farmers, who typically own less than 2 hectares of land.In the past year, Modis popularity has fallen by 12 percentage points among farmers, according to a Mood of the Nation survey published last week by the Lokniti, part of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), a research institute.Next years election would be fought on farmers issues, said Yogendra Yadav, a leading academic-turned-politician. Farmer organisations in some states began a 10-strike on Friday, in which they have said they will stop selling produce to protest a steep drop in the prices of an array of farm goods.Farm Minister Singh said his government had yet to hear from farm leaders but was ready to listen.COMMODITIES CRASHPrices of pulses, a key crop for Indian farmers, have fallen 25-30 percent below state-set support prices, as higher imports and bumper local crops bumped up supplies. While the government announces support prices for more than 20 crops each year to set a benchmark, state agencies actually buy only rice and wheat at the support level.Vegetable prices, especially onions, cabbage and tomatoes have fallen 25 percent from last year, largely because of the lack of refrigerated trucks that could take the perishables to the consuming big cities. Milk prices have also dived by more than 25 percent in the past year as a global glut has brought exports to a near halt.Farmers in Charkhi Dadri, three hours drive west of the capital New Delhi, recently dumped tomatoes onto the road in protest after buyers offered a quarter of a rupee per kilogram for a crop that costs at least 6 rupees ($0.09) a kg to produce.Jai Bhagwan, 54, borrowed 12,000 rupees to grow onions on a plot of about half acre in Jhajjar, an area otherwise famed for pottery. When his crop was ready, Jai Bhagwan could get only 1,200 rupees.I could not even recover my labour cost, said Jai Bhagwan, who was in New Delhi recently to participate in a farmers meet. Prakash Singh, also from Jhajjar, spent 6,000 rupees to grow green chilli, but the crop fetched him barely 200 rupees.Im in debt up to my eyeballs. But I cant sit idle, so Ill have to borrow more to grow something else, Singh said.Ashok Gulati, a farm economist who advised Indias last government, said there were three policy options to support farmers: building state buffer stocks to soak up excess supply, acting to boost exports or building capacity for processing farm commodities into end products such as milled, dehusked pulses or vegetable oils.Most of those measures would require long-term structural changes, however, and analysts predict in the run-up to the election Modi is likely to announce more populist, short-term fixes such as higher guaranteed prices for crops and farm loan waivers.Many farmers complained they are still reeling from disruptions caused by the launch of a new nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July 2017 and a ban on high denomination bank notes in November 2016. Blaming the shock move for exacerbating farmers financial woes, Gulati said: Expectations were high from the government, but the fact is that the plight of farmers is far worse now than what it was four years ago.Modis drive to purge black money from the economy by removing, at a stroke, 86 percent of the cash in circulation, made it difficult for farmers, who survive on cash, to buy inputs like seeds and receive payments for their crops.In Kairana, all 35 farmers Reuters spoke to agreed that abolishing 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes had made things worse.POWER SURGEFarmers in Uttar Pradesh, home to 220 million people, are also angry over a sharp rise in the pump price of diesel and a steep hike in electricity tariffs. Many farmers in the state use diesel to run tractors for ploughing and trolleys for moving their produce to wholesale markets. They depend on electricity to operate irrigation pumps.Diesel prices have shot up by more than 40 percent to record highs and electricity tariffs have surged by more 20 percent in the past two years, said Shri Pal, a farmer from Shamli.Villages account for most of Indias diesel consumption and thats why higher prices pinch farmers the most, but diesel in India is much more expensive than Bhutan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, said Hannan Mollah, a former lawmaker and a senior official of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).Kairana and Shamli lie in the sugar cane belt of Uttar Pradesh, the top sugar state of India, the worlds biggest producer after Brazil. Soaring global output has caused a collapse in sugar prices, leading to losses for mills who now owe nearly 23 billion rupees to cane growers.A BJP spokesman, G.V.L. Narasimha Rao, said the government has streamlined timely payments to cane growers. That has not been enough to satisfy farmers such as Ram Lakhan Singh, a cane grower from Shamli. Most sugar mills have not paid us a single rupee since December and the government has connived with them to deprive us of our rightful dues. Trust me, cane farmers will think twice before voting for the BJP.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

On Thursday, the government bit the bullet and seems poised to reap benefits for summoning the courage to stop incentivising a tiny section.The calculation is that the levy on capital gains on equity will, in part, provide the funds needed for Modicare, supposed to be the worlds largest public-funded health insurance scheme, an audacious initiative which should bury the political insinuation that Modis was a suit-boot ki sarkar.The charge had looked an exaggeration after the government managed to sell demonetisation as a wealth redistribution scheme, a tool which robbed the corrupt rich to pay the honest poor.The sheer optics of a Budget  which blends the imposition of capital gains tax with ambitious schemes of health insurance for the poor and paying farmers 50% over the cost of production along with benefits for women and senior citizens  should blunt whatever punch, if any, the Ambani-Adani taunt would have still packed.If the setback among Gujarat farmers warned government of rural unrest due to stagnation in agriculture, the Budget shows that the BJP leadership did not waste time imbibing the message.The plan to cushion producers and consumers of perishable crops like potatoes, onions and tomatoes against the vagaries of production should help deal with grouses that took away from the governments success in checking runaway inflation under the UPA and dulled the appeal of its welfare moves.Expansion of MSP cover to 24 crops covering 90% of arable land, extension of credit facility to animal husbandry and dairy farming and the plan to extend the benefit to share-croppers and lessees should calm a countryside thats displayed its annoyance with BJP yet again by going with Congress in the Rajasthan bypolls.The measures will amplify the message that Modi has sought to put across by providing free cooking gas connections to the poor, reaching electricity to thousands of unlit villages and constructing subsidised houses for the rural populace at a fast pace.Micro, small and medium enterprises have been celebrated as the new potential engine of growth, with benefits proposed to compensate them for the hit they took post-demonetisation and in the wake of GST rollout.Concern for job-creation that fits the conventional description was reflected in FMs incentives for labourintensive sectors of leather and textiles and the nudge to employers to formalise jobs.Sullenness among youth  another constituency, which like farmers, turned out in huge numbers for Modi in 2014  has emerged as a major worry. The government expects jobs to emerge from the thrust on infrastructure as well.Absence of tax relief for the middle class may not necessarily reflect a shift of affection away from Modi. It is sure to upset vocal categories, with the surprise decision to announce fixing salaries of MPs fuelling angst.But what looks like an ommision in a perfectly political budget may perhaps also be an indication that it may not be this governments last one before it faces the popular test."

""GST (goods and services tax) or no GST, Arun Jaitley 's proposals will not shake our household budget,"" says Vandana Kansal, homemaker and wife of private bank vice-president Sanjay Kansal The family, which lives in Sector 20 of Panchkula, says the budget is ""okay, okay"", neutral in terms of revenue and disappointing on the tax front. A reduction in the excise duty on petrol excise is a welcome step for it. ""Since most household items are now part of the GST system and this tax cannot be changed unless approved by the GST council , this year's budget was not so much about the prices of household items. The only upsetting this for the family budgets is not much tax relief for the salaried class,"" Vandana said.""The tax slabs should have been redefined as it has been a long back since the last big revision,"" said Sanjay Kansal. ""The slabs needed revision because rupee has depreciated. The salaried class gets standard deduction benefit of Rs 40000 but it will include medical allowance of Rs 15,000 and transport allowance of Rs 19,200. Effectively, this is very little benefit. With the cess increased from 3 to 4%, this class will actually end up paying more tax. With price rise unabated, practically we have less money in hand for savings and household expenditure.""The children of the family, however, are happy, as the budget lays emphasis on better opportunities for education and skill development. Engineering student Ritvik and Class-XI boy Kartikey are happy about cheaper footwear but sore about costlier mobiles and televisions.The budget has brought cheers to the family elders. Sanjay's mother, Santosh Kansal, said: ""As a senior citizen, I am happy for higher interest on my income up to Rs 50,000."" Being a bank officer, Sanjay's overall view on the budget was: ""Considering that it is sort of pre-poll budget and our farmers are in real distress, I'll call the proposals pro-farmer and pro-poor, even a watershed budget. The biggest provision is 'Modicare' on the lines of ' Obamacare ', where the poorest 10 crore families of 50 crore members will get annual medical care of up to Rs 5 lakh each in case of hospitalisation. It was needed. I like the provisions for farmers, be it Bamboo Mission or credit flow to agriculture and allied activities or mega food parks. Operation Green will help increase the production of potato, tomato, and onion, and save us from abnormal rise in the prices of these food items."""

The price quoted by the vendors on pavements was Rs 20 a kg in the late evening hours.Kailsah Tajni, the chairman of wholesale vegetable merchant association, APMC, told TOI, The price of tomatoes has come down to Rs 5-6 a kilo compared to Rs 6-7. But the kitchen staple sells at Rs 40 per unit at upmarket retail plazas, while the general price was Rs 20 a kg. Brinjal is sold at Rs 5 per kg in the wholesale market, but its prices jumped to Rs 30-60 a kg, depending upon the location. There has been a declining trend in wholesale prices of vegetables since the beginning of January due to an excellent winter crop, but the retailers had pocketed the benefit and unsuspecting customers were paying more. Retail rates of most vegetables remain high in Mumbai. Each year prices tend to drop after November 25 as winter sets in but this year rates did not fall until after December 15. On Friday, cauliflower is selling for Rs 60 per kg, brinjal Rs 80 and broccoli Rs 120, said Ayesha Bano, a resident of Four Bungalows, Andheri. Tomatoes are at Rs 16-22 and onions Rs 30.The Dadar Plaza Market is the main wholesale market of exotic vegetables. Trader Dharmendra Vaish said, Prices of most exotic vegetables including broccoli, zucchini and Chinese cabbage have dropped. In growing areas farmers are selling for Rs 7-8. The wholesale rate in Dadar is Rs 15-25 per kg. Retailers who factor in overhead costs and some profit can sell for Rs 35. If they are charging more than that it is profiteering.An experts said, the absence of space to sell directly produce had resulted in few markets and as a result the crash in wholesale prices had not been transferred to buyers."

The incident took place at about 11 pm.According to CTF officials, they received a tip-off saying that two smugglers were transporting ganja from Visakhapatnam Agency to Hyderabad. In an apparent attempt to evade the police, the accused travelling in an Innova car bearing registration number AP 05 BP 4992 refused to stop at the check-post and sped past. In the process, the car rammed a police vehicle. Soon, a high-speed chase ensued for the next three hours even as the car was driven rashly on the highway. Finally, the smugglers were intercepted at Kanuru village and they were taken into custody.While conducting checks, the CTF officials seized around 300 kg of ganja packed in polythene covers from the vehicle.About 300 kg ganja worth of 50 lakh was seized and we also impounded the car. We are interrogating the accused. Investigation is still on, said a senior CTF official.Meanwhile, sources said that the gang was involved in the illegal trade for some time and has been notorious in supplying ganja to Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.The police said the accused were also involved in circulation of counterfeit currency. A case was registered against them under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. The CTF have been delegated to crack down on ganja smuggling in the city. Vijayawada stands as a major transit point for the smuggling in the recent years, however cops said that consumption is much lesser in the city. Recently, even the directorate of revenue intelligence too caught a number of major cases in Enkepadu area and other places where they have seized tonnes of Ganja this year. This isnt the first time the CTF are chasing down ganja smugglers in a dramatic fashion, four months ago they did nab a speeding truck near Nandigama area where they seized more than 900 grams of produce hidden amongst tomatoes."

5b17828f9855b7604256bf52,‘I avoid creating one-dimensional characters’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/i-avoid-creating-one-dimensional-characters/article23429294.ece,2018-04-04,,The Hindu,"A book usually gives a fair idea about its author even if one never gets to meet him face-to-face. There may be exceptions but it holds true for Perumal Murugan, the Tamil writer, several of whose books have been translated into English. The latest being Poonachi or The story of a black goat (Context).We meet at The Parks Mist restaurant for lunch. Asking the staff to suggest South Indian cuisine, Murugan quickly settles for onion uttapam. I can never say no to onion uttapam; its my favourite, he says with a genial smile. Meanwhile, fresh watermelon juice is served providing a perfect start to our chat.With a collection of poems and short stories and now Poonachi , Murugan seems to have gotten over the controversy created over his book Madhorubhagan or One Part Woman . Referring to it, he observes, I do not hold any grudge or hard feelings. What I am very sorrowful about is that peoplewho did not read my book protested against it. That is what dismayed me. It must have been hard giving up writing? No, on the contrary, I got enough time to spend with my family, grow potted plants and devote time to academics, says Murugan with the help of an interpretor.For Murugan, writing has been a second nature since he was eight. There was a childrens programme on Trichy radio station in which poems written by kids were read out. I used to regularly contribute for that. I wrote everyday because I am introvert, retiring and shy by nature. I did not talk a lot, and always avoided crowds. So, writing poems and stories substituted social interaction. Believe it or not, I managed to fill up 30 notebooks, he recalls.Writing short stories commenced from Class IX. I was inspired after reading graphic tales in magazines which I could not afford but my aunt used to buy. Gradually, my teachers came to know and encouraged me to participate in local school contests. Thus set in motion was Murugans life long passion for chiselling words.Pursuing Ph.D., Murugans first novel Eru Veyyil (The Rising Heat) was published in 1991 which he wrote during his summer vacations. I was 25 then and wrote it staying with my mother in a thatched hut with no electricity. My mother would be busy with the livestock while I lost sense of time adhering to my own clock. I used to only sleep, eat and write, never going out. This got her worried with many suggesting that I had lost my mind. So before returning to Chennai, she made me wear a holy thread blessed by a pujari around the waist. Every time I returned home I had to show it to her, he jests. As a child he loved sitting on a village boulder scribbling in his notebooks. My neighbours would tell me that one day I will get stuck to the boulder and would have to be surgically separated from it.Having lost his father early, Murugan was very close to his mother. I was called a mamas boy even after I got married. In a certain sense I narrate my mothers story through Poonachi. Like the goat, she too was the seventh child who lost her mother at birth; was a loner with her father being rarely at home. Their filial bond is so strong that even today Murugan has kept his mothers cell phone and SIM card as a memory.So is Murugan like his mother, a staunch believer of God? In my early years I was, visiting Kali and Murugan temples regularly. Later, studying Marxism and Periyars works, I started questioning, with the intensity of worship coming down. Those days, I argued with my mother on several occasions. Over the years reading more on these issues, I have come to the conclusion that whether God exists or not is not important but what is pertinent is whether He is necessary or not. For those He is, they must believe in Him without being criticised. Espousing live and let live, his belief sounds fair. Continuing, he adds, I do like to spend time at some of my favourite temples and tend to embrace the spiritual component of religion.The staff brings in sizzling onion uttapam with different chutneys, the coconut and its mint and tomato flavoured versions. Trying each of them, Murugan, gestures his appreciation. The uttapam is crisp and well made and the chutneys delicious. Not averse to trying local cuisine, the writer generally prefers South Indian dishes. I relish idlis, ragi dosa made with palm sugar, rice and paruppu kuzhambu; dishes made of country chicken but staying in Korea for a writers residency I had local preparation for a month without any fuss. Hailing from a rural region, Murugan has a weakness for vegetables. I love bitter gourd, suraikai (bottle gourd), lady finger, podalangai (snake gourd), brinjal and peerkangai (ridge gourd). The joke at home is whenever I am sent to buy vegetables these are bound to figure. Murugan does miss some preparations of his native place like kachayam, made of rice flour and jaggery and soiyang, a steamed pulse based dish kneaded with palm sugar. With passage of time, people have stopped making them.Calling himself a reasonable cook, Murugan reveals that like writing, he embraced cooking very early in life. With my parents leaving early to work on fields, my brother and I used to prepare and eat breakfast and walk five kilometres to school. We simply learnt by observing mother and helping her. He counts arisi paruppa, milagai (black pepper) and herbal rasams as his best preparation. The ridge gourd subzi I whip up, is relished by my wife so much that on returning home after holidays she always asks me to make it.Murugans felicity with cooking comes across in some of his works too. Yes, it does, but not deliberately, only on demand of the narrative. For example, in Arthanari and Aalavayan , sequels to the One Part Woman , I talk about how to grow and prepare a local variety of egg plant as mother used to. In Poonachi, I write about rice gruel and how to make dry salted meat pieces for future use. Likewise, in Seasons of the Palm there is description of ragi porridge.Drawing parallelsHaving learnt to wield the pen and cooking spud since childhood, Murugan says one can draw a lot of parallels between the two arts. For cooking and writing, passion, perseverance and persistence are must. Also to excel in their craft, the cook and writer must get out of their comfort zone and try something new. And eventually, both food and a work of literature must satisfy people.Reflecting on the making of a writer, Murugan states, The command over language and the content selection comes with experience. The foundation of good writing is the ability to get past ones own value system because that is what holds us from absorbing a lot of things. A good writer has to suspend his own value system and assimilate experiences. Did this come to him naturally? No, in many of my early works, for example, my short story collection, Thiruchengodu , I was heavily biased. Later I got over them and started writing on issues considered taboo by society. Examples of these are Pee Kadaigal (tales about shit) and Kethavarthe Pesarae (I speak bad words).Talking about keeping aside biases, Murugan is remarkable for etching characters which are neither black nor white. I avoid creating one dimensional characters. I believe all humans are a mix of both. In Poonachi, the old lady who is very caring to the goat becomes selfish when it comes to her survival. In her early years, her love is pure and selfless while later when she faces financial crunch, her kindness becomes conditional but that does not make her an villain. That is the way humans are, he remarks as we wind up our interaction.What I am very sorrowful about is that people who did not read my book protested against it. That is what dismayed me"

It is used to establish the diversity between populations, authenticate a species and in timber forensics.The process of DNA isolation involves treating the tissue sample from a species in chemical solutions called buffers, which is put in a column (a small container) and processing them in a centrifuge, which isolates the DNA. Earlier, this process was done manually, which would take almost a day. Later, there were several commercial kits which simplified the DNA isolation process.But these kits worked well only for commercial crops such as rice, tomato or cotton. When it came to tree tissue samples, most of these commercial kits usually dont yield results as trees have certain chemical compounds called secondary metabolites, which tamper with the reactions, said Modhumita Dasgupta, a scientist at the department of plant biotechnology in IFGTB, who was part of a group of scientists which devised the kit. Dasgupta said they have introduced an extra buffer solution in the kit which would remove secondary metabolites from tree tissues, thus giving pure DNA samples.She added that they first devised the protocol for their own laboratory use. They had patented it in 2009. Last year, the institute registered the trademark ArborEasy. The ready-to-use kit was launched on January 24.Dasgupta said those kits which yielded results for tree tissue samples were expensive. It cost around Rs200 to Rs300 for one reaction. But we have brought it down to Rs95 per reaction, Dasgupta said. Also the kit gives a high amount of DNA compared to other commercial kits, she said.In one reaction, our kit yields the amount of DNA other commercial kits yield in two, she said. In case of difficult tissues, our kits yield DNA, when others give none, she added.The kit isolates DNA from tissue samples in just around 90 minutes, said Dasgupta. She added that the DNA isolated using the kit has very high purity and a longer shelf-life, Dasgupta said. The DNA isolated using the kit can be used for experiments. We have used it for sequencing sandalwood genome, she added.The institute is also planning to commercialize the innovation, officials said. DNA isolation kits have a huge market today. Almost every college has students who do projects which involve DNA isolation at some level, Dasgupta said.For the first time, the institute has been planning to market the product in e-commerce portals, said S Murugesan, scientist and group coordinator for research, IFGTB. We also have asked for a seed funding to set up a unit in the institute to produce the kits commercially, he said."

And this has started affecting their price in the retail market.Usually, during February and March, the supply of vegetables is stable as the air can hold moisture for a long time and it is suitable to store them for one to two days. In April, the supply starts dropping and two months later the prices soar by around 25% to 30%.Currently, the supply of cauliflower has been reduced from 336 bags (50kg each) to 325 bags. Similarly, tomato supply has come down to 1,300 crates from 1,500 crates in 10 days. The marginal reduction in supply has led to increase in prices. The tomatoes that now cost Rs 20 per kg in the retail market costed Rs 14 per kg 10 days ago.Mohan Salpe , secretary of agriculture produce market committee, said, Only a required amount of vegetables is being harvested by farmers every day. The supply is already coming down, the effects of which will be visible in next one week. Vegetables, being a perishable produce, gets easily spoiled during high temperature. Also, adequate care needs to be taken while transporting vegetables during summer. At the same time, the supply of some vegetables such as spinach increases these days as farmers cannot keep such produce in the farm for more days unlike brinjal (eggplant) or tomatoes.The vegetable supply in retail markets comes from the nearby rural parts of the district. The sugarcane farmers tend to cultivate vegetables as inter-crop in their farms after sugarcane is cut and sent to the mills. Such vegetables are available in abundant during January and February.However, now the supply of vegetables grown as intercrop starts declining and the retail markets depend on vegetables supplied from the distant places that makes it costly owing to the transportation cost."

They have formed a group and set up a sales outlet at Athappa Gounden Pudur near L&T Bypass in the city on Wednesday to sell their farm produce directly to people.This comes against the backdrop of the prices of perishable farm produce such as tomatoes touching a low in glut season, forcing farmers to go for distress sales or dump them as waste. Though in such times perishable produce are bought from farmers for very low prices, they are sold for prices several times higher in retail outlets. Farmers say this is because of middlemen commission and transport charges being added to the price.Farmers who started the outlet said direct sales will ensure a decent profit margin for them and also bring down the selling price as middlemen will be eliminated. They also said such outlets will connect local farmers with consumers, providing a sustainable business model for farmers.The district president of farmers association, A S Babu, said the major cost addition in farm produce was transport cost. If people travel to Coimbatore from Sulur to buy farm produce, the cost will be significantly higher, as the transport cost and labour cost will be added along with commission for middlemen. Farmers outlets will do away with such costs, Babu said.Babu said the price of onions sold by farmers had fallen by five times in the past two months. But big retailers sold the same onions for almost 1.5 to 2 times the price. If farmers sell it directly, the price would be much lesser, said Babu. He added that through their outlet they would also give their produce to wholesale sellers. State treasurer of farmers association C Thangaraj said such an outlet was new to the region. There have been such efforts in places such as Karur and Erode, he said. He added that they saw agriculture as a local market, so they sought to connect farmers and consumers from a locality."

The centre was established in 2004 with the motive to reduce post-harvest losses by creating value added products from farm produce. A year later, it started offering training programmes.""Generally, during glut season, the price of a product drops drastically. In such times, farmers throw away perishable goods such as tomatoes. In order to reduce such wastage, we invite them and show them how they can produce value added products such as ketchup using tomatoes,"" says N Varadaraju, head of the centre.The incubator at the centre offers monthly training programmes in food processing under eight units  juices, jams, ketchup, masalas, pickles, bakery products, pasta and millet milling.

None of these promises have been kept. The BJP government ought to be termed a government that does not keep promises.He said, We have a similar experience with the Fadnavis government in Maharashtra too, and farmers are planning a march from Nasik to Mumbai, to gather outside the state assembly in protest. The farmers of Rajasthan have inspired movements in other parts of the country. The chief minister probably believes that by stopping farmers from arriving today, she has scuttled the movement.

If the government of Kerala can do it, why cannot Rajasthan? The procurement price of grain in Kerala is higher by Rs800 per quintal than elsewhere. The government says it does not have money to waive farm loans. Vikram Kothari of Rotomac pens got loans of over Rs3,000 crore to import wheat. Wheat is not even produced in Singapore.

Theres also a new attraction this year  Tomatina (tomato-throwing festival)  and most of these celebrations are lined along the Beach Road. Around three tonnes of overripe tomatoes have been procured from the markets and farmers for the Tomatina festival, which is being held for the first time in Vizag.However, green NGOs have cautioned the denizens on wastage of thousands of litres of water during the Holi fest and have stressed on the need for water conservation.Though preparations and pujas for Holika Dahan (bonfire lit at night prior to Holi) were held on Thursday night, most of the programmes will be held on Friday including the Street Festival and Balam Pichkari.The street festival would start in the morning and continue till 11 pm. The main attractions are food and fashion bazaar, Tomatina, rain dance, camp fire, rock band and sky lanterns at RK Beach, opposite Hawa Mahal beside Gokul Park.

Nearly 500 kgs of tomatoes would be procured for the event and participants will throw those tomatoes at each other. We hope to make it a memorable Holi celebration for Vizagites this year, Srinivas said.He added that the Tomatina festival will also indirectly help the farmers as their overripe tomatoes, which normally would have gone waste, was fetching them money. As the city has been attracting tourists from across the globe, such unique festivals will further add to the citys charm, Srinivas said, adding that there will be a food and music festival too as part of Tomatina.He said around 500 people have already registered for the festival, and said they were expecting the number to reach 1,000. We hope that by the time the event starts on Friday we will reach that number, Srinivas said.According to the organisers, district collector Pravin Kumar is also expected to participate in the Tomatina festival."

A year since its inception, H Kiruthikas eatery  which serves as many as 47 varieties of dosais  has become one of the most sought-after destinations for Trichiites. What is more, a customer can even get his or her own dosai recipe tried out here for a small fee.Asked to pick her favourite from the lot, Kiruthika says the special sweet dosai is of huge demand. Right from top police officers to restaurant owners, we have some loyal customers for this particular dish, she tells TOI. Available for Rs 30, the specialty dish is made of dosai laced with brown sugar, grated coconut and ghee.Other top-selling dosai varieties include all-in-one dosai, Mysuru masala dosai and onion rava dosai.

Potato crop is also likely to remain down to stagnant this sowing season, horticulture departments senior official said.The official said, Heavy losses suffered by onion and tomato farmers in the past months has discouraged sowing.In June 2017, farmers staged protest in the entire state after onion prices slid to Rs 2 per kg. Tomato prices have also tumbled this season to Rs 5 per kg-Rs 8 per kg in the wholesale market on increased arrivals.Agriculture experts said, even the soil moisture remained less during the sowing period owing to less rains.Farmers shifted to chana as it gave better returns to farmers last season. Also chana requires less water making it the preferred choice of farmers when rains are not sufficient, said Kailash Agrawal , an agriculture expert.Chana and wheat are the leading winter sown crops of the region.Agriculture departments statistics stated that farmers have sown wheat on over 5.75 lakh hectare while chana was sown on 4.75 lakh hectare in Indore division.Horticulture department expects yield of potato to remain lower this season hitting output due to lower soil moisture.Mohan Pandey, a wholesaler of vegetables in Choithram market said, Prices of onions and tomatoes are unlikely to pick up from the current levels in near term as supplies from the old stocks and neighbouring states are sufficient to meet the demand."

The WPI data showed prices of pulses contracted an annual 24.3%, while those of vegetables rose 15.4% during the month, slower than the 36.7% rise in the previous month. Onion prices remained stubborn, increasing nearly 80% in February but lower than 127% in the previous month.Available trends suggest a pick-up in prices of some cereals, edible oils and milk was offset by a continued correction in prices of onions and tomatoes in the current month. Moreover, average crude oil prices so far in March 2018 remain lower than the trend for the previous month. However, an unfavourable base effect for crude petroleum and natural gas, and fuel and power is likely to push up the WPI inflation in March 2018.

In reply to an email, a PepsiCo India spokesperson said the variants will have 11% juice and will be sold in smaller serves of 250ml at an affordable price point.While sugary carbonated drinks attract GST of 40%, companies pay around 12% GST on juices, said an industry expert. PepsiCos new drinks are slated to fall into the latter category.The new range of locally relevant, fruit juice drink with fizz under brand Slice will be available as a pilot in select markets to start with, said the spokesperson. Rural and rest of urban (RoU) segments are currently 60% of the juice category and have been growing faster than metros. By riding on both company and franchise go-to-market sales and distribution infrastructure, we want to dial up growth and market access for our juice products in these key rural, RoU markets.Over the last few years, the Rs 14,000-crore carbonated soft drink industry in India has faced flak from consumers, who suddenly had a plethora of healthier options, such as dairy products or juices from local players to choose from.Akhil Gupta, MD of New Delhi-based Fresca Juices said, We introduced juices in all possible pack sizes, from 160ml and 300ml to one-litre and even two-litre economy packs. Starting with just one litchi flavour, Fresca has currently introduced new flavours, including orange mojito and tomato.Prices of carbonated drinks also witnessed an upward trend with the government increasing sin tax. To add to the woes of biggies, small regional players cropped up, launching 250ml PET bottles at Rs 10, which often mimicked variants from the larger players. As a result, sales growth of the industry remained stagnant.PepsiCos new offensive will be watched carefully by beverage companies, as many said blending fizz and fruit is a tricky job.

J Saravanan is one of the very few who dared to abandon his profession as a goldsmith to become a parotta master and subsequently launch the super-hit food joint, Sri Mahesh Tiffin Centre.Known especially for its egg-less kaima parotta, laba parotta and veechu parotta, Saravanans eatery, which opened seven years ago at Bajanaikuda Street in Palakarai , has people swarming every night to taste the delicious food items. Passion for cooking was something I picked up while I was learning to become a goldsmith in Sri Lanka, says Saravanan. In the mornings, I used to get trained to open a jewellery workshop while at nights I found time to learn to prepare parottas, he said.After staying in Sri Lanka for close to eight years, Saravanan moved back to India in the mid-nineties and was working as a goldsmith for about four years. I soon realised that it was not something I wanted to keep doing and hence took up the job of a parotta master at an eatery and worked there for about nine years, the 47-year-old recalled. On gaining confidence to start an eatery, he didnt think twice before plunging into the food business. Right from the first day, the response has been really good and close to 200 customers visit my place every day now, he said.Open from 6.45 pm to 12 am, kaima parotta, laba parotta and veechu parotta  which are available for Rs 50, Rs 40 and Rs 15 per plate respectively -- get over in an hours time thanks to the huge demand. I dont use egg in any of these varieties and for kaima parotta especially. Unlike other eateries, I also dont use ingredients like ajinomoto that are not good for digestion, he claimed. Since Im both the owner and parotta master, I dont dish out items in an unhealthy way to decrease the preparation cost, he said.The main ingredients of kaima parotta at his eatery are parottas, ginger garlic paste, coriander leaves and tomatoes. Apart from these parotta varieties, kuska, idli and idiyappam are also highly sought-after among the customers. When asked if he had any plans to expand his business in the future, Saravanan said, I get tempted to do so every once in a while. But many have had huge failures when they got too ambitious and expanded their eateries. Im just playing the waiting game for now, he stated.What: Egg-less kaima parotta, laba parotta and veechu parottaWhen: 6.45 pm to 12 amWhere: Bajanaikuda street, Palakarai"

He found the man haggling with an ambulance driver to get his dead childs body to the graveyard. Pasha saw the father send the body off and then head in his direction. He wanted to know if there was a canteen nearby where he could have a meal. The man hadnt eaten all day, he said, hoping to save the money for his childs treatment. It was that encounter that led to the initiative Doh Roti  started by Pasha and his friend Fayaz Ahmed about two months ago.Along with a group of volunteers and help from well-wishers, they make and distribute 400 meals (rice and dal) and 300 rotis to relatives of patients atHospital,Cancer Hospital and Al Bilal Diagnostic Center.The duo first began distributing meals to about 300 people every day near IGICH. Later, they met Mysurus Body Miyan Ayub Ahmed (who has been performing the last rites for unclaimed bodies, for the last twenty years in Mysuru), and Azhar Maqsudi (who feeds the hungry in Hyderabad in a similar initiative). With help and advice from them, Pasha and Ahmed scaled up and Doh Roti was started.(BM wrote about Ayub Ahmed on Feb 13, 2017 - Call him Body Miyan.)Pasha, who runs a hotel in, says: We took a room in Bilal Masjid to cook the food. Now we are a group of 25 volunteers. Every day, we cook between 10 am and 1 pm. After prayers, we begin the distribution. In the first round, relatives of patients at Jayadeva hospital and Al Bilal Diagnostic Center get the meals. Then, we go toand distribute there.The groups aim, he says, is to ensure that nobody sleeps hungry. Hunger has no religion, he adds.Arul Subramani, who runs an NGO for those infected with HIV, volunteers with this group.Weve been friends for a long time so it was easy to make this possible. We cook about 35 kg of rice every day. We also need about 12 kg of onion and tomato, 3 kg of other vegetables; this we usually get through contributions. A small food company here gives the 300 rotis. Each meal costs us Rs22, he explains.Sometimes, demand overshoots supply, and they have to replenish before heading for Kidwai, but its all taken care of.Ahmed, who co-founded the initiative, saysis a hospital hub. Patients come from various parts of the state and country for treatment and they stay on. While the government provides free food for patients, their caretakers have to fend for themselves. Not everybody can afford to eat out three meals. This is why we want to help, he explains.Luckily for them, theres plenty of help available. Their initiative has inspired others to open their hearts too. Ansar Khan, also a volunteer, tells how. I buy the vegetables from a shop in Madiwala. One day, the woman from whom I buy in bulk got curious and asked me why I needed so much every day and I explained to her our work. From then on, she has refused to take money for the vegetables, says Khan.Hundreds, if not thousands, of people have benefited from the teams dedicated efforts already.Anjanappa Nayka, whose son is being treated at Jayadeva Hospital, has come to the city from Raichur. I came here seven days ago. It is really hard to afford the food here; it is three times more expensive. A person at the hospital told me about the free food in the afternoon. It has been a relief; there are others like me too who have benefited from this, he said.The initiative is such a hit now that Ayub Ahmed has started it in Mysuru at. And team has also finalised the plan to start this in Tumakuru."

Though the output has doubled in the last three months, the prices are yet to pick up. On Monday, the model price for the number one variety stood at Rs. 56 per 10 kg box, and the second at Rs. 30 per box.Though the stocks are reaching the Madanapalle market in several loads, the prices are not encouraging, say the farmers. From the last week of April, the produce showed signs of cracks due to intolerance to the abnormal heat. Mercury hardly crossed 35 degrees Celsius in the previous years in the area. For this reason, the first variety loads have dwindled, leaving the second variety to thrive, causing concern at trading.As the undamaged stocks are being sent to all over Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and other southern States, the domestic market has to depend on the loads with cracks and black spots.No cheer till JuneThe trade is unlikely to bring cheers to the farmers till May end or June first week, though it is projected that the stocks reaching the market would increase from the present 360 tonnes a day to more than 500 tonnes.Expecting profits, the farmers of Anantapur district, Chintamani, Rayalpadu and other border areas of Karnataka are also thronging the Madanapalle market. Despite the discouraging conditions, they have some consolation that the price is better than their domestic markets.Market Committee (Madanapalle) Chairman Ratakonda Gurappa Naidu said compared to the other markets in Rayalaseema or the southern States, the trade is not that disappointing. By the next two weeks, the heat might come down with seasonal showers or monsoons arrival. We are expecting bulk stocks from this month end. The situation is likely to improve soon, he said."

The Economic Survey points out that farm income may decline by more than 4% in a year. Heavy rainfall reduces income by 13.7% and 5.5% for kharif and rabi crops respectively.The budget provides for greater use of clean and renewable energy sources but does not deal with the management of climate change in relation to farming. It is important to set up climate risk management R&D centres at the block level. Such centres should be supported by trained climate risk managers. Climate change could become a mega catastrophe and there is need for immediate steps both in the areas of mitigation and adaptation The budget has provisions which can insulate farmers from distress sale and poor income . The finance minister has announced minimum support price (MSP) for all unannounced crops of kharif at one-and-a-half times of their production cost. If income is less than the support price, the government has said that it will make efforts to buy the surplus produce of the farmers.More allocation will be made for building warehouses and for upgrading 22,000 rural haats into grameen agricultural markets. The budget sets apart 2,000 crore for an agricultural market and infrastructure fund. Several steps have been proposed for promoting sustainable agriculture such as organic farming. Horticulture will be promoted with greater attention to the marketing of tomato, potato and onion and similar perishable commodities through operation greens with 500 crore allocation.Another welcome feature is to integrate attention to fisheries and animal husbandry with kissan credit cards.The national bamboo mission will be restructured in order to enhance the cultivation and consumption of bamboo products. The emphasis placed on self help group formation, cooperatives and other organisational methods which can provide the power of scale to the small scale producers is welcome.The priority given to rural infrastructure and irrigation will help impart stability of income and employment. Malnutrition is another serious problem and we need to promote symbiotic linkages among agriculture, nutrition and health.On the whole, the budget addresses some of the hotspots in the field of farming, the most important being the management of the monsoon and the market."

He has made a budgetary allocation of Rs 500 crore for the scheme.'Operation Greens shall aim at promoting Farmer Producers Organizations (FPOs), agri-logistics, processing facilities and professional management.The announcement of this scheme comes at a time when onion farmers of Nashik, the largest onion growing district in the country, are at the receiving end as they are not getting the right prices for their produce in the market.The scheme, insisted experts and farmers, will go a long way in preventing financial losses to onion growers following crash in wholesale onion prices that they often have to cope up with.According National Horticulture Research & Development Foundation (NHRDF) sources, the average production cost for growing onions is around Rs 900 per quintal and farmers incur losses if they get the price below that.But there have been several occasions in the past when the wholesale onion prices had crashed increasing the woes of the onion farmers of the district. And they had restored to agitations by organising protests like road roko demanding redressal of their grievances.Some onion farmers still recalled the huge crash of onion about two years back forcing 1.94 lakh onion farmers of the district to sell around 28 lakh quintals of onions at Rs 300-400 per quintal in just two months in 2016. They incurred financial losses of Rs 150 cr during that time.A major onion grower of the district Nivrutti Nyaharkar said that for long the onion farmers of Nashik have been demanding a scheme like Operation Greens to tackle the problem of onion price volatility."

The miseries of financially distressed farmers seem far from over even as they continue to demand waiver of farm loans and remunerative prices for their produce through several platforms across the country.The problem of plenty has hit the farmers badly. While garlic farmers in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, which produce 45% of the countrys garlic, recently fetched as low as Rs. 1 a kg in wholesale prices, the instances of tomato farmers dumping their harvest on the fields earlier this month  be it in Haryana, Tamil Nadu or Uttar Pradesh after prices nosedived  have only highlighted their woes. Tomato production during 2017-18, according to the first advance estimate, is likely to be 7.8% higher than that of the previous year. However, it is 20% higher than the average production of the past five years. Similarly, potato production is estimated to be 1.5% higher than that of the previous year. However, compared with the average production of the past five years, it is 8.7% higher. These figures indicate that farmers are producing more without good returns. Why are vegetable farmers not getting a fair price? Season after season, farmers face price uncertainties mainly owing to fluctuations in demand and supply caused by bumper or poor production, speculation and hoarding by traders.Are traders manipulating prices?In Madhya Pradesh, after garlic prices dropped sharply, the government decided to include it in the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (Price Deficit Payment Scheme) that was introduced in the Kharif 2017 season. Farmers, however, rue that with the conditions associated with the scheme, most of them are unable to gain any benefit. The scheme is aimed at providing price deficit payments to farmers if the market prices are below the minimum support price. Farmer leaders believe the implementation of this scheme in the first season has resulted in little benefit to farmers, with very little to prevent manipulation of prices by traders. The government claims to have disbursed Rs. 1,900 crore in compensation, but a large section of farmers has been excluded from the scheme, says Jai Kisan Andolan national convener Avik Saha. Those left out bore the brunt of a larger price crash because of market manipulation.What is the way forward?The fluctuation in vegetable prices has become a perennial problem and is usually associated with the economics of demand and supply. Farmers, mainly marginal and small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. Being perishable, vegetables are more prone to price fluctuation, hence they require better infrastructure for storage and marketing. Contract farming is an alternative for farmers to reduce financial risks by providing an assured market for their produce at a pre-agreed price. The Centre last week approved the State/UT Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2018. The Act lays stress on protecting the interests of farmers, considering them as weaker of the two parties entering into a contract. The Act is aimed at ensuring the purchase of the entire pre-agreed quantity of one or more of produce, livestock or its product. Although varied forms of contract farming exist in some pockets, a formal system is not widespread. By and large, cultivation of commercial crops such as cotton, sugarcane, tobacco, tea, coffee, rubber and dairy has had some elements of informal contract farming.Experts believe that integration of vegetable and fruit growers with agro-processing units through contract farming could prove beneficial to producers as it takes care of price fluctuations and helps to mitigate production risk. Pratap Singh Birthal, professor at the National Institute of Agricultural Economics and Policy Research, says: Under the contract farming law, the agreements would help farmers get an assured price for the produce, which will act as a buffer against price volatility and market fluctuations...Vikas Vasudeva"

But, given the trail of films made by RGV in recent years, somewhere midway through Officer the thought that cropped up is, at least this one is not an assault on the senses, so far rather than being wowed by whats being shown on screen.Officer has an interesting story, which the filmmaker reveals is based on real incidents. Hyderabad-based cop Sivaji Rao (Nagarjuna) is asked to head a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe into the ways of Narayan Passary, a cop credited with finishing off the Mumbai underworld, but who has now fallen from grace. Its an insider perspective of the police force and its dark corners. Can a cop himself build another underworld company to avenge his contemporaries? Throw in a few personal relationships and you get the necessary emotional heft.It sounds good as an idea but on screen, there are uninteresting stretches. It feels like were watching it from a distance without ever being invested in the proceedings. RGV has explored the crime-underworld-cops tropes before and excelled in his initial years, but this one doesnt have the zing. Several moves are over-explained and theres no surprise. In that scene where Passary is swiftly cornered and arrested, its doesnt take long to guess that the tables will eventually turn. There isnt enough backstory to these cops who are at loggerheads  one keeps harping that he did everything for the system and that he likes to torture people before they die; the other is just squeaky clean. The occasional underworld characters are caricature-like rather than fearsome. One of them plays a double-edged game but that too isnt explored well.The only reason to keep watching is Nagarjuna, who tries his best to hold things together. For all his display of agility and professionalism as an SIT officer, one only wishes for a better script. Myra Sareen and child actor Kaavya dont make a strong impression. And, it looked like the child actor was asked to display exaggerated emotions than being natural.RGVs fascination for unusual camera angles continues, thankfully they arent nausea-inducing. Several empty glasses are in focus  see a room through a glass, listen to a conversation through several glasses theres a scene where Nagarjuna is on a video chat with his parents who are seated at the dining table lined with two rows of empty glasses and an oddly-placed tomato. I dont remember the conversation because the focus was more on the glasses and the tomato.Officer also gets voyeuristic where it shows a close shot of the villain with pliers in his hand, threatening to splice off a childs fingers. The camera turns away but we know hes done it, because of the atmospherics. What were they thinking depicting such a sequence?The best part is, it all gets over in a little more than two hours."

Yet vegetable prices are at the upper end of the normal spectrum as retailers cite spoilage due to summer heat.APMC's former director and wholesale trader Shankar Pingale said, ""The average number of 550 trucks arrived Saturday. The market is closed on Sunday so we will assess the impact on Monday morning. But our farmers are continuing to dispatch produce because they have cultivated a good crop, so we do not expect any shortage or price increase for Mumbaikars.""Most vegetables are selling for Rs 60-80 per kg in retail markets of Khar, Andheri, Chembur, Bhandup, Malad and Borivli.Santosh Kesarwani, a greengrocer at Ahimsa Road, Khar, said, ""The only visible increase has come in tomato which has risen to Rs 25-35 from Rs 16-20 earlier. Spoilage is rampant during summertime and this causes farmers and vendors to charge more. A 25-kg box is being quoted for Rs 800 instead of Rs 400. Also, vegetables grown within Maharashtra are cheaper than those which come from other states. Most of Mumbai's tomato supply arrives from farmlands in Karnataka and transporters are charging more to cover the distance because of the strike.""On Sunday, tomato sold for Rs 40 per kg in certain shops of Chembur and Matunga but remained an average of Rs 25 in parts of Andheri and Bhandup.Cauliflower, lady finger, cluster beans (gavar) all sold for Rs 80 per kg in Andheri East, Khar, Chembur and Bandra East. The typical variation across localities was apparent in the quality and cost of produce.Meanwhile the cost of fruit, especially watermelon has risen owing to the seasonal spike witnessed during the holy fast of Ramzan. A single fruit averaging 2.5 kg sells for Rs 65-70 at Rs 25 per kg. However, alphonso mangoes are available abundant and cheap at Rs 250-350 per dozen as the king of fruit has flooded the market. Lychees have made a grand entry at Rs 60-70 per dozen which should settle to Rs 40 as the days wear on.Milk prices are stable. Cattlesheds in Goregaon and Jogeshwari are unaffected by the milk farmers' agitation. ""We hiked rates of loose milk before Ramzan and are now selling both cow and buffalo milk for Rs 70 per litre,"" said an attendant of Ghaswalla dairy in Jogeshwari. ""The strike does not impact us.""National dairies are doing their best to cope. The spokesperson of Mother Dairy Fruit & Vegetable said, ""We are keeping a close watch on the situation.

Into its third day on Sunday, Kisan Avkash has already witnessed farmers dumping vegetables and milk on streets to hit supplies to urban centres and lead to a rise in prices.Right now, we are clearing the stock we had, but if trucks dont arrive tomorrow as well, prices will definitely go up, said a wholeseller of potatoes and onions. According to him, wholesale prices of both are currently Rs 600 per crate (50kg), making the retail price at around Rs 20 per kg. This will get worse in the coming days. Already, there was no auction of potatoes held today, he said.So far, price of potatoes and onions have not risen, but the price for tomato is already hit.

As a result, price of tomato has gone up as almost 100%.Vegetable associations said the price hike is not necessarily because of the strike. Most of the produce at Gurugram mandi doesnt come from parts where farmers are on strike. Potato prices could have increased because cold storages have started stocking up in anticipation.Till recently, vegetables were arriving in excess from areas around Gurugram.That has now fallen, with stock now coming from places further away, adding to transportation cost, said Inder Thakran , president of Gurugram Sabzi Mandi Association.At a retail store in Sikanderpur, retailers said the supply is still the same. The strike has had no impact here, as most of our vegetables come from nearby areas such as Pataudi, Rajasthan, etc, said the store manager at Haryana Kisan Mandi Zone Fresh near Bristol Chowk.However, sellers at the mandi said prices of some vegetables, like French beans, bell peppers and even mangoes, could rise if the strike continues. They added that rising prices could be profitable for them. We get less to sell, but can charge more in profits, said a seller, not wishing to be named.Mangoes have already seen a Rs 15-20 per kg rise, after the rate had dropped around two weeks ago.Authorities at the mandi said not much will change unless strikers start obstructing transport that brings in the vegetables to the city, or if the strike spreads to nearby areas.The recent hike is not because of the strike. Some vegetables cant be procured locally. Sellers here have to buy them from Azadpur mandi in Delhi, said Thakran, referring to bell peppers and French beans."

The farmers across the state continue to stop milk tankers of different diary cooperatives to choke the supply of milk.The Jaipur diary officials said that it will not have any adverse effect on the prices, the diary chairman Om Punina had said the problem is restricted to Chomu and Kaladera region only. However, the sources told TOI that situation could spiral out of control as diary tankers are being forcefully stopped.""Milk collection at several villages has witnessed a sharp decline. We have ample stock for now, but for how long can we sustain is to be seen,"" an official said."

5b1b27719855b76d570379f4,The loneliness of Lionel Messi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/football/top-stories/the-loneliness-of-lionel-messi/articleshow/64167670.cms,2018-05-15,,The Times Of India,"It happened in 2014. With just two minutes remaining, hearts ticking faster than the stadium clock, Messi stood over a free kick. The Argentine faithful prayed for the divine to intervene. It seemed improbable from that distance or width. But it was a sort of moment when miracles happen, dreams come true.The hopes were dashed a moment later.Four years ago, it could have been Lionel Messis night of redemption, glory, fulfilment and maybe even peace. But 1-0 down against Germany, he failed to seize the day.There was a more earthly opportunity earlier, but Messi had rolled the ball wide.The fans wondered: Would he have scored if he was in a Barcelona jersey? The thought was irrelevant, but damning. For, Messi is condemned to bear the cross. He is Atlas Telamon, the enduring Atlas for whom the Golden Ball for Best Player was a burden because his best on the day was not good enough.It would be crossing many lines to place his predicament in such Biblical or mythical proportions. In fact, an Argentine football club recently recreated the Sistine Chapel on the ceiling of its gymnasium, with Diego Maradona as God and Lionel Messi as Adam, although the latters genius on field can sometimes make us forget his tortured soul.Barcelona may have his heart but Argentina has his soul. You read in a Guardian blog that his accent remains Rosarino, his favourite actor is Ricardo Darin and his favourite food is his mothers milanesas with tomato and cheese.Messis wedding last year in his hometown may not have been as simple as his tastes, so do his tax records, but give him a football and the real meaning of jogo bonito comes alive.Possibly there is Cristiano Ronaldo pushing him to the edge and beyond, the sound of broken records and numbing numbers. The endless stats, comparisons, full-page analysis are there for people to gobble, but there is something intangible. A rose doesnt compete with another rose, it simply blooms. There is simplicity, honesty, flavour, joy, intuition, playfulness. It is as though time doesnt exist.And yet time is ticking, ticking away for Messi, all of 30 now.The agony was palpable when a crouched Leo, wallowing in despair, hand on head, chose to call it quits. Having been beaten by Chile in the 2016 Copa America Centenario final, Messis moist eyes conveyed his journey was in vain. He could almost taste the trophy before it was snatched away, before he sent the penalty into heaven. Feeling responsible, he walked away shedding his cloak as Argentinas deliverer. Maybe, he can get back to happiness now at his Nou Camp fortress, away from the scrutiny and remarkable blame. And even hatred (news of his statues being vandalized in Argentina is a common story).Yet, love brought him back. The arrival boards at Buenos Aires airport read: No te vayas Lio: Lio, dont go. Despite all the problems in the Argentine federation and the storm within, the outpouring of affection changed the script.The qualification for next months World Cup was purgation. Argentina, who played under three different coaches, were outside the four qualifying spots going into the final match in Ecuador. Jorge Sampaolis team talk was emotional: Messi does not owe the World Cup to Argentina, but football owes the World Cup to Messi.Argentina were struggling to breathe in the high altitude of Quito, falling behind after 37 seconds. But the heros bright attitude and genius changed everything. A hat-trick, completed by an exquisite dink over the goalkeeper, ensured the flight to Russia and escape from ignominy.Now, Messi with his van Gogh beard, stands in front of the jury again. Perhaps, its been a refreshing season at Barcelona, the early ouster from the Champions League a definite blessing for all those Argentines begging for their messiah to be wrapped up in cotton wool. Perhaps, the resurrection will be complete on July 15 at the Luzhniki Stadium and a new Easter Sunday will be celebrated.Or perhaps, he is just human, destined to fall again. He would have touched the stars anyway. The world, maybe, is not meant for one as beautiful as him.Lets celebrate the Man, or the Messiah. Because we are going to miss Messi when hes gone."

All the crops, which he had planted and nurtured with high hopes, were completely destroyed by wild boars.According to Sasidharan Nair, wild boars have been causing huge trouble to the farmers of Thalappattumala  Pullambara regions in the Vamanapuram block for over 18 months. Even after receiving frequent complaints from the farmers, the agriculture department and the forest department havent initiated steps to address their woes.Last February, out of four tonnes of spinach cultivated I got only one and half tonnes. The crops are being damaged by boars during night time. Though we have complained to the authorities, they havent taken any action yet. We are living in a country that gives much importance to animals than humans, said Sasidharan Nair.Another farmer in the region, Radhakrishnan, had grown Paddy in five hectares and could produce only less than 500kg as rest of the crops were destroyed by wild animals.Nellanadu and Thottumpuram wards are other rural areas where the wide boar menace was reported. Plantains, tapioca, colocasia, elephant yam, ginger, and turmeric are the major crops which were destroyed due to animal raids.Shanthakumar, a farmer from Nellanadu, said, The boars mostly attack tuber crops and vegetables including peas, bitter guards, tomatoes etc. Farmers like me used to take farmlands on lease, now we are in crisis, he said.According to the Pullambara panchayat president Azeena Beevi, the panchayat is planning to take on preventive measures to defend the crops from the raids, with the help of Krishi Bhavan. The existing solution with panchayat is BOREP, a pig repellent peptide which can be applied at farms.The solution offered by the panchayat is not sufficient to address the issue, feel the farmers. They demand solar fencing for their land.Thiruvananthapuram wildlife warden Shaji Kumar said, Many cases have been reported in the areas bordering forests regarding the killing of wild boars by the locals. It is a criminal offence and under wild life protection act we will file cases against the locals."

Traders here blame Pakistan governments blanket ban on import of vegetables and soybean from India.A cross-border trader and Federation of Karyana and Dry Fruit Commercial Association president Anil Mehra said, Exporters are left jobless. He said there was apparently no reason behind Pakistan refusing to import vegetables and soybean except that its government had bowed to the diktats of hardliners who did not want to have any relations with India. Not only are we suffering but even labourers and transporters are at loss, said Mehra.A vegetable exporter from Bathinda, Narinder Sharma said, We often talk to our importers in Pakistan, but they are also helpless. They are now buying vegetables at much higher prices than they used to while getting goods from India. He said tomatoes were being sold at around Rs 5 per kg in the wholesale markets in India. Had Pakistan been importing tomatoes, the domestic price would have been more than Rs 20 per kg in wholesale. The Indian government should also take retaliatory action so that Pakistani businessmen also feel the heat of their governments decision, he added.In 2016-17 financial year, the value of exports to Pakistan via Attari ICP was Rs 1,063 crore, which dropped to Rs 744 crore in 2017-18. I cannot comment on the reason for decline of exports to Pakistan through Attari ICP since it is an issue between two countries, commissioner of customs (preventive) Dipak Kumar Gupta told TOI.Giving details of the volume of trade, Attari ICP deputy commissioner Balwinder Singh said India had exported vegetables, cotton/yarn, high density polythene (HDPE), soybean and other items amounting to 2.51 lakh tonnen in 2016-17 in Pakistan while there was no trade of vegetables and soybean to the neighbouring country in 2017-18.Balwinder said overall, they had registered around 30% decline in total exports and around 76% decline in the movement of trucks. He said the Indian imports from Pakistan via ICP registered a minor increase in 2017-18 as compared to the previous year, which also raised the revenue in terms of customs duty. India earned Rs 430.95 crore in customs duty on imports from Pakistan via Attari ICP in 2017-18, up by 77.72% from Rs 242.49 crore in the previous year.In 2016-17, India had imported goods, including dry fruits, dry dates, cement, soda, glass, gypsum rock/powder, aluminium ore and limestone, valued at Rs 2,907 crore from Pakistan via Attari ICP. The value of imports rose by about 17% to Rs 3,403 crore in 2017-18. However, in 2017-18 there was a minor decline in imports of dry dates, soda, glass, and cement from Pakistan.Sources said Pakistan had deliberately banned import of Indian perishable goods to dent the Indian economy and cause resentment among the farming community. As expected, farmers suffered (due to ban). A lot of tomato growers had dumped their produce on roads and staged demonstrations last year. Tomato was otherwise exported to Pakistan via Attari, they said.The foundation stone of Indias first ICP at Attari was laid by former Union home minister P Chidambaram on February 20, 2010, and it was later inaugurated by him on April 13, 2012."

Devyani Pandey who has a Lhasa Apso says, ""I keep my dog inside my house and dont let it go outside even to the porch. In the morning, when I go running, I take it along and post-sunset we go to the park to play. I brush it regularly so that it feels light."" While this is the normal routine for most dog owners, cat people have it a bit more difficult as cats don't like water. Persian cat owner Vivek Kumar says, ""Since my cat has long fur, I get it trimmed during summer. I keep a pack of ice under its bed and keep its bed near the cooler. I wipe it occasionally with a wet sponge and then dry and brush its hair. I also make sure that it drinks plenty of water after every meal."" Guinea pig owner Jahanvi Bhushan Mishra feeds her pet snacks that are high in water content. ""My guinea pig does not like to drink much water, so its diet includes plenty of tomatoes, cucumber and watermelon. I dont keep it in its cage the whole day. It roams the house and sleeps under the bed in the afternoon. At night I keep its cage near the air conditioner so it can sleep peacefully.""During summer, zoo keepers have to make special arrangements for the animals. The director of Van Vihar National Park, Samita Rajora says, ""Our aim to keep the animals stress free so they dont fall sick. In their natural habitat they are able to tackle the heat, but here, they are dependent on us. We have created artificial water bodies so that they can take a dip and coolers have been installed too. The traditional way of cooling has been adopted by us. We have put screens made of khus-khus which is kept wet throughout the day. It cools very well. Wet hessian cloth is put on the enclosures as many animals prefer sitting outside.""Dr Brajesh Gupta points out three symptoms to watch out for in your pets. If they stop eating and sleep the whole day, or start vomiting or have loose stools. When these symptoms are noted, the pet should be taken to a vet. He shares, ""Animals are prone to heat stroke, so pet owners should give them special care. They should be given fresh food and water. Snimals like cats and dogs can be given curd which will help them with digestion. If you are traveling with your pets, make sure that they are kept at a stable temperature. Dont bathe them often as then their fur will lose its shine and the threat of tics will increase.""To help stray animals, Bhopalis are keeping bowls filled with grains and water outside their houses. Animal activist Swati Gaurav says, ""We have successfully placed cement containers through which the animals can quench their thirst. We are also planning to build permanent containers on the outskirts of the city which the highway animals can access.""- Farzana Patowari"

Thanks to a glut in the market and the steepest price drop witnessed in April in nearly a decade, tomatoes have become cheaper than even fodder. Tomato farmers claim they are getting just Rs 2 for every kg of produce, which does not even cover harvesting costs.Usually, tomato prices peak during April because of short supply due to high temperatures. However, statistics available with the Agricultural Marketing Information Network (AGMARKNET) show that the April-2018 prices are the lowest for the vegetable during this month in the past eight years. The tomato glut is evident in the Pune wholesale market as well, where 10 kg of the vegetable is available for between Rs 30 and Rs 80.Shriram Gadhave, the president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India , said this is the first time in several years that prices have hit such a low, almost 60% less than the same period last year. The water table has surged thanks to the rains last year, causing a supply surplus. The prices of many vegetables have dropped because of a glut in markets. Cattle owners in the city and nearby villages have now started taking large quantities of tomatoes and other vegetables left unsold to feed to cattle, he said.ND Ghule, assistant secretary, Agricultural Produce Market Committee, Pune, said the increase in tomato supplies led to a drop in prices. Vegetables such as tomato, eggplant and leaves of beetroot and cauliflower are in demand among them as they have become dirt cheap, he further said.The cattle farmers sometimes take 40 tonnes, or more, at a time for free to feed their cattle, added Sunil Kumbharkar, who owns a vegetable wholesale firm in Market Yard.Ramesh Jadhav, a farmer from Malegaon, says he does not know what to do with his 16-acre tomato plantation. Farmers, who are yet to harvest their tomato crops, are letting cattle loose on their fields so that at least they can be consumed by animals. For the first time in years, the per kilogram price we are getting for tomatoes has plummetted to Rs 2, which does not even meet the harvesting cost, he said. Last year, tomato prices had peaked during April, which is why farmers had sown more tomatoes this year, he said."
5b1b5f599855b76d57039789,Trump hosting glitzy White House state dinner for Macron,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/trump-hosting-glitzy-white-house-state-dinner-for-macron/articleshow/63889373.cms,2018-04-24,,The Times Of India,"WASHINGTON: Now it's President Donald Trump's turn to pull off the ultimate charm offensive.Wined and dined on multiple state visits during his tour of Asia last year, Trump is paying it forward and celebrating nearly 250 years of U.S.-French relations by playing host to President Emmanuel Macron at a glitzy White House state dinner on Tuesday.Months in the making, it's the first state visit and first big soiree of the Trump era in Washington ""It sounds like what they're planning will be spectacular,"" said Jeremy Bernard, who was White House social secretary in 2014, the last time the U.S. feted a French president.The White House has said little beyond the fact that dinner will be served, sticking to the tradition of trying to maintain an element of surprise for its guests.In fact, Macron will break bread twice with Trump.On Monday, the president and Melania Trump dined privately with Macron and his wife, Brigitte, at Mount Vernon, the home of America's first president, George Washington, on the banks of the Potomac River in Virginia. The White House had said the setting would serve as a reminder of France's ""unique status"" as America's first ally.Trump ended his first year without receiving a foreign leader on a state visit, making him the first president in nearly 100 years to do so and heightening the stakes for Tuesday.Dinner tickets are typically highly sought after by Washington's political and business elite. A few inklings of who's in and who's out already are known: Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, is in, as are House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky was invited, but his office said he is unable to attend.In a break with tradition, Trump invited no Democratic members of Congress or journalists, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the arrangements. But at least one Democrat will be in the crowd: the office of Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards confirmed his attendance.Approximately 150 guests will take their seats in the State Dining Room on Tuesday, making for a more intimate affair than those held by President Barack Obama. Obama's guest lists numbered into the hundreds, requiring that the event be held in a tented pavilion erected on the South Lawn because no room in the White House can accommodate that many people.Most of the responsibility for executing a flawless celebration falls to the first lady and her staff, including such key details as what is served (Trump likes wedge salads and chocolate cake) and poured into glasses (Trump wine?), who sits next to whom, who performs after dinner and what the decor looks like.One big moment is the first glimpse of the first lady in her gown. Fashion details are kept secret until the first couple steps on to the North Portico on Tuesday night to welcome their dinner guests.Former first lady Michelle Obama often used state dinners to showcase the talent of up-and-coming designers. Some designers have cited Trump's politics in refusing to dress the current first lady, a former model. Still, a likely choice would be Dior, the French design house whose fashions Mrs. Trump often wears, or Herve Pierre, the French-American who designed her inaugural gown and other looks.The last time a Republican president hosted his French counterpart was November 2007 when President George W. Bush welcomed the newly divorced Nicolas Sarkozy.More than 100 guests feasted on lobster bisque, lamb with tomato fondue, green beans and sweet potato casserole, salad and dessert served in the State Dining Room. Among the guests were major league baseball pitcher Tom Glavine, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, French chef Guy Savoy and several Louisiana politicians.After dinner, guests strolled down the hall to the East Room to watch performers in the roles of Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette, the Frenchman who served on Washington's staff in the Continental Army. Sarkozy toured Mount Vernon the following day.When Macron's limousine first pulls up the White House driveway on Tuesday morning, Trump, the first lady, White House and administration officials, and hundreds of invited guests will be waiting on the South Lawn. The pomp-filled arrival ceremony is for the man who became the youngest president in French history when he was elected in 2017 at age 39 on his first run for office.The visit also offers Macron his first Oval Office meeting and a joint White House news conference with Trump. There's also a State Department lunch hosted by Vice President Mike Pence before Macron and his wife arrive for the state dinner.The Trump-Macron relationship appeared to get off to a bumpy start with a white-knuckler of a handshake when the political novices met for the first time at a NATO summit in Brussels last May. But Macron likely sealed the bond after Trump accepted his invitation to attend the annual Bastille Day military parade in the center of Paris in July. Macron and his wife also took Trump and the first lady on a tour of Napoleon's tomb and whisked them up into the Eiffel Tower for dinner overlooking the City of Light. The experience led Trump to order up a military parade for downtown Washington later this year.But the two part company on some significant issues, including the Paris climate accord, which Trump withdrew the U.S. from last year, and the Iran-nuclear deal, another multinational agreement that Trump is itching to pull out of. The president did successfully rally Macron and British Prime Minister Theresa May, with whom Trump has sparred, to mount a joint military operation against Syria in response to an apparent chemical attack this month that killed Syrian civilians. Macron still worries about Trump's desire to remove U.S. troops from Syria.An art lover who speaks good English, Macron is known to watch what he eats. Yet he told reporters at an agricultural fair in Paris in February that ""I drink wine at lunch and dinner.""Discerning his tastes, including likes and dislikes, even allergies, is one of the first things the White House tries to pin down for all guests, said Bernard.""You're really focused on making sure the guest feels special,"" he said.Mrs. Trump's social secretary, Rickie Niceta, came aboard last year after two decades of event planning for a caterer whose clients included the White House, the State Department and several embassies, in addition to working on the past five presidential inaugurations, including Trump's. The first lady, who speaks French, also has experienced hands running the kitchen, pastry shop and florist's lair. All three women helped execute more than a dozen state dinners for Obama.Trump owns hotels, including one near the White House, and knows about good hospitality.Bernard recalled that, just as invitations were about to go out for the 2014 dinner for then-French President Francois Hollande, news broke that Hollande and his longtime girlfriend had abruptly split. Mrs. Obama's staff anxiously sought clarity on whether Hollande would bring another date.He didn't, and Bernard dealt with the awkwardness of the situation by seating Hollande between the two Obamas."

Don’t, advise doctors",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/popping-pills-to-cure-acidity-often-dont-advise-doctors/articleshow/63885556.cms,2018-04-24,,The Times Of India,"PATNA: Medical experts have cautioned people against popping anti-acidity pills without medical prescription, especially during the summer.According to health experts, high temperature causes stomach related issues or digestive ailments. In a bid to find quick relief, people buy anti-acidity drugs, often the most potent ones, over the counter, which is a dangerous trend.The process of digestion involves the breakdown of food through the hydrochloric acid, which is naturally present in stomach. Health experts said frequent use of anti-acidity drugs can neutralize the effect of hydrochloric acid produced naturally by the stomach and alter the entire process of digestion. This can also cause kidney damage and osteoporosis.Regular use of such drugs without the supervision of professionals can alter the absorption of important elements like zinc, iron and chromium. The production of digestive enzymes will be hampered and, in the worst case, it can lead to kidney damage, said city-based physician Dr Diwakar Tejashwi.According to medical experts, anti-acidity drugs are mainly of three types  stomach acid neutralisers, or antacids that provide quick relief in the short term; H2 blockers that provide relief for up to 12 hours by inhibiting histamine, the stimulus for acid production in the stomach; and PPIs that produce greater acid suppression by preventing the acid from being secreted into the stomach.Doctors have advised people to prefer natural eatables like bananas, melons and coconut water to avoid the chances of acidity during the hot days. Dr Ramesh Kumar, a gastroenterologist at All India Institute of Medical Sciences AIIMS ), Patna, said the main reason behind stomach related ailments during summer was consumption of substandard edibles from roadside eateries.Water and food-borne bacterial infections, especially amoebic dysentery and diarrhoea, increase manifold during this time of the year. The major symptoms of such diseases are vomiting, food poisoning, loss of appetite, dehydration, constipation, heartburn, bloating and low blood pressure. To avoid such risks, one can avoid eating fried food items, cheese and the ones containing citric acids like tomatoes, tea, colas, coffee, as it can cause heartburn, Dr Ramesh said.He added small precautions can curb the risk of such diseases. Eating stale food, irregular meals and overeating can often lead to indigestion. Keep well hydrated and look for mineral water which contains bicarbonate as this aids digestion and reduces acidity, advised Dr Ramesh.According to general physician at AIIMS-Patna, Dr Ravi Kirti, mild digestion syrups can be taken in case of extreme restlessness as they protect the stomach lining and provide instant comfort to unbearable gastric symptoms. One should carry rehydrating salts before moving out in sun, by adding six teaspoons of sugar and half teaspoon of salt to a litre of water. Instead of relying on medicines, people should consume seasonal fruits and vegetables to keep their stomachs happy, Dr Kirti said."

Over the years, she came across many people, especially leprosy patients, with open sores and was determined to alleviate their suffering. Last Sunday, Angelin launched Wound Care On Wheels, an initiative wherein she and her team will clean and dress the wounds of those living on the streets.We will be taking dressing materials like betadine, gauze, gloves and approach people in need of help. We will get their permission before we do the dressing, says Angelin, director of The Candles that works in the field of mental and physical health. Along with a couple of colleagues, I will be visiting areas between Purusawalkam and Broadway , she says, adding that the team will start work from Friday and will be visiting the areas twice a week, as dressing needs to be changed.The Candles runs several projects, including awareness programmes on menstrual hygiene in schools and colleges across TN. As part of their project, Amudha Surabhi, the organisation gives health mix porridge to government school children. Feeding the homeless is part of their Share With Care programme. We distribute food thrice a month in the areas between Anna Nagar and Broadway. We get parotta and kurma or idlis from hotels, says Angelin. Or our volunteers cook vegetable or tomato rice.And thats when they came across people on the streets who needed medical aid. Many of them have wounds that are not bandaged properly or are covered with dirty rags, says Angelin. They are hesitant to go to a government hospital as they have to wait in long queues. We did do dressing for a few people but then thought we should have a sustained programme. Angelin, who has done a diploma in hand and leprosy physiotherapy, prefers to use the term Hansens disease instead of leprosy. Stigma still exists around the word leprosy, she says.At the moment, they will be using their own bikes to get around. We are looking for donors who can help us with basic medical supplies or an autorickshaw for us to go around, says Angelin. Psychologist Dr Mini Rao, who has been involved with the NGO for several years says, Many still hesitate to interact with people with leprosy. This initiative will touch several lives."

The spicy mix traditionally comes in a scooped-out potato cup (kulle) but vendors are now experimenting with fruits, tomato and cucumber as the base. Made popular by food walks, this new avatar of kulle chaat is lapped up by tourists and shoppers in Chawri Bazaar and Sitaram Bazaar, but Purani Dilli frowns on these upstarts who have tinkered with the original.How can you make kulle with tomato? agonises Ashok Mathur , 48, a fifth-generation Old Delhi resident, who has grown up eating Sultans Kulle in his neighbourhood. Kulle used to be only made of aloo or shakarkandi (sweet potato). The spicier, the better! This was followed by a cup of tea, Mathur recounts, sitting in his 100-year-old home in Roshanpura.Arun Kashyap , 32, sits at the same spot where his great grandfather, Sultan Singh, parked himself on a raised platform outside a Jain household, in a narrow bylane that runs parallel to Nai Sadak Kashyap says he has grown up hearing tales of the legendary Mukesh  the singers family lived in Old Delhis Chelpuri  eating kulle made by his great grandfather when he was a roaming hawker with a khomcha (stand).Banana was the first fruit our family experimented with for customers who liked fruit chaat but didnt want the traditional aloo as the base for kulle. Now, we make it with more fruits but the regulars insist on aloo, says Kashyap, who also serves aloo chaat and tikki.The aloo is sand-baked at a bhatti in the Old Subzi Mandi area in the morning. By afternoon it reaches Roshanpura, where Kashyap scoops out the middle to make space for the filling.He starts with a few pinches of a homemade masala which, Kashyap says, has 36 ingredients. This is followed by boiled chana (small chickpeas), kala namak, roasted jeera powder, black pepper, boora (powdered sugar), pomegranate seeds, a squeeze of lemon and finally topped with sliced ginger.This was a vantage point when Sultan set up base here 80 years ago; but changing demography and competition from chaat vendors on the main roads, have made life tough for his great grandson.But support from the local community has kept Sultans kulle going. We use the space outside a Jain familys house but they dont charge us. They let us store our wares inside, and even pay for the kulle they consume, says Kashyap.His chaat still draws members of the Mathur families, who once occupied most houses in this neighbourhood. Today, the homes have given way to shops and godowns. Sultans masala runs in our blood, says Ashok Mathur, talking nostalgically about how people used to choke the lane during Ramlila celebrations to relish the kulle served on dhak patta.So, next time you take Nai Sadak to cross over from the food streets of Chandni Chowk to Jama Masjid , do try out this palate cleanser."

Unable to recover even the production cost, distressed farmers are dumping the produce in fields and on roads in Sehore, Narsinghpur and Raisen districts.Market reports disclosed price of tomato crashed to Re 1 and even 50 paisa per kg in some districts forcing farmers to seek government intervention. Reports from Sehore - the home district of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Narsinghpur and Raisen- reveal price variation is hitting farmers hard.In Budhni (Sehore) and Gadarwara (Narsinghpur) dumping of tomato on the roadside has become a common sight. Tomato growers said there was a glut in the market as more farmers took to its cultivation, . Moreover, a slump in demand in neighbouring states also contributed to the crash in price. Farmers in more than a 12-13 districts cultivated tomato on a large scale, resulting in lesser demand for tomatoes, they said.""In August-September last year, farmers sold tomatoes for as high as Rs 50 to Rs 70 per kg due to high demand. Now, the price has crashed to 50 to 60 paisa a kg in the wholesale market, which is less than the production cost. But in retail, the crop is being sold for Rs 10 per kg. Farmers are compelled to dump tomatoes on roadside as a mark of protest,"" said a farmer of Gadarwara.In Nasarullaganj and Shahganj - the two main areas under the assembly constituency of the chief minister- farmers are not even able to recover transportation cost. Mahesh , a farmer from Shahganj claimed in a field of two acre, he spent Rs 10,000 on seeds, Rs 9,000 on pesticides, Rs 3,000 on irrigation and Rs 50,000 on labour. But, could not recover the cost for which he had drawn a bank loan of Rs 5 lakh. Minister of state for agriculture Balkrishna Patidar said those who are dumping tomatoes on roadside are not farmers, but protesters. Farmers never dump their hard-earned produce. Farmers know well the price fluctuation. Otherwise they would not have opted for tomato crop, the minister said.""The demonstrations are planned and farmers are not involved in dumping of their produce. Price fluctuation is a normal process. At times, farmers had earned Rs 50 per kg, when there was a demand. Now, they have to sell it at a lesser margin. Had farmers not earned benefit last year, they would not have opted for the same crop this year,"" Patidar told TOI."

The market authorities claim that the area is cleaned twice a day.The garbage bins are almost overflowing and even the space outside the shops is littered with leftovers. Rotting vegetables and fruits seems to be scattered on the road. During a visit to the grain market on Tuesday, the TOI team found few of the shopkeepers dumping rotten tomato and potato in the open and on the streets. Due to this, the passersby and customers looking for vegetables and fruits were facing a lot of problems. The market's roadsides were full of dirt, junk material, and garbage.Some of the vendors had pitched their carts on the muddy patches and their vegetables and fruits witnessed had dirt all over. And many people were buying these items, too. To the naked eye, these items seemed injurious to health. The loading and unloading of trucks was in progress on the main road inside the market, which had jammed this passage.Vegetable peels flies into the eyes of the customers and commuters. Even many of the shopkeepers sitting in the ground were found to be uncomfortable because of the stinking environment they had created themselves. Dustbins in the market had not been emptied in days. Most of these were either broken or not in a usable condition. Encroachment around the main gate and the inside main road was rampant. Rows and rows of trucks occupied the middle of the road. The other vehicles didn't have space to even squeeze past.Sector-26 grain market secretary M K Sharma said: ""Every day, we collect garbage in the trollies. This problem recurs after every spell of rain and we had been facing it for the past many years. All problems stem from the disorderly traffic. One of the alternatives is to shift the grain market to Sector 39. Because of the crowd, we are unable to collect waste from each corner. This waste is dumped outside the city. The marked generates waste in bulk indeed.""Bablu, a shopkeeper at the grain market, said: ""This market is cleaned twice a day but most of the shopkeepers chuck their waste on to the road and litter the interior areas as well. Even though they are responsible for the problem, most of the big shopkeepers do not accept their responsibility or behave in a disciplined manner.""The customers at the market attributed many problems to all the dirt, garbage, and unpleasant smell generated from the place.

In fact, tomato growers throwing their dumping their produce during peak season has become a routine affair. During these events, farmers blamed the traders syndicate.After carefully studying the situation, the state government issued a GO de-notifying vegetables and fruits from Andhra Pradesh Markets (agriculture produces and livestock) Act. The de-notification will reduce the price gap between producers and consumers through reduction in intermediary supply chain and creation of alternative marketing channels, said agriculture minister Somireddy Chandramohan Reddy . He said it would also promote investment on development of marketing infrastructure with private sector participation.The move is expected to bring down the prices in the retail market as growers are free to sell the stocks anywhere in the state besides enhancing farmers profit.

Annually, the country loses about Rs 2,40,000 crore through the post-harvest wastage of fruits and vegetables, says G J Janavi , head of the department of nano science and technology, TNAU India is the second largest producer of fruits and vegetables, after China. But there are several post-harvest losses from the producer to the consumer, she says. This is because of the lack of proper harvest practices, transportation and cold storage facilities, she adds. She says that around 35% to 40% of fruit and vegetable produce are wasted.The department of nano science and technology at TNAU has been trying to reduce post-harvest losses of fruits at all links of the supply chain, say researchers at the department. While the spraying of Enhanced Freshness Formulation (EFF) on mango trees prior harvest and dipping of mangoes and bananas in EFF solution slows down ripening, and control losses at farm level, researchers have come up with methods to control losses in package houses, transportation and retail shops.The department has devised and patented a technology where EFF is injected into nanofibres, which are coated on a strip of foil or paper or infused in a pellet, which is placed in a fruit carton. The hexanal in the EFF vaporizes, which is imbibed by the fruits, resulting in increased shelf life, says K S Subramanian , professor at the department and the principal investigator of the project.Also, a transparent film made of nano-cellulose extracted from banana fibre, which is infused with EFF, when used as a cover slows down ripening and brings down losses in tomatoes, said Subramanian.We are also working on bringing down losses during transportation. In the vaporization method, hexanal is made to vaporize in a chamber where fruits are kept. This can be done in a truck when the fruits are being carried to long distances, he adds.Farmers say such technologies would help them a lot when they export fruits. It takes 10 days to take fruits by sea to Singapore, 25 for Australia and 28 for the US. If such a technology is used in the container, the losses could be controlled in an easy and effective way, says P Pugazhendhi, 58, from Krishnagiri , who runs a firm which exports fruits."

Balwant, who owns around 40 acre farmland on very tough terrain, is a worried man as the prices of tomatoes have crashed. A vehicle full of tomato crates sent to Kalamna wholesale market was brought back without selling the produce, since it was fetching a very low price of Rs50 a crate, which comes to just Rs2 a kg. The recent weather has weakened the yield and reduced its shelf life, said Balwant, who, left with no option, decided to feed the tomato yield to his cattle.Balwant said it doesnt make sense to sell tomatoes at Rs2 a kg as it does not recover even the basic expenses involved like seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, transportation and commission to agents.Pandurang Tarare, another villager involved in traditional farming, said he too was very depressed when he heard that the rates of tomatoes have gone below Rs50 per crate. He plans to wait another week, otherwise he would also feed the yield to his bullocks. He said the Centre should do something as farmers are facing hardships, especially in Vidarbha region.Shriram Ghadhave, president of Vegetable Growers Association of India (VGAI), said Maharashtra has seen a 10-15% rise in area under cultivation for tomatoes. Previously, farmers from western Maharashtra used to go for vegetable crops but in recent times farmers from Vidarbha and Marathwada too have started growing vegetables. He also attributed this growth to the good rainfall in the state last year. As against 2.5 lakh hectares of tomato cultivation, this year we have about 3 lakh hectares, he said.Lately, farmers have increased cultivation of vegetables as it ensures cash flow in the short term. This takes care of their immediate needs. However, as the number of farmers growing vegetables apart from their main stay crop has increased, it has led to an oversupply as well. Its not only tomato, rates of other vegetables like brinjal, ladyfinger and cauliflower too have gone down throughout the region, said farmers as well as farm activists.Locally grown vegetables, including tomatoes, are fetching a price within Rs2-4 a kg. In some cases, its just a couple of rupees, say market sources.Kishore Tiwari of Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission (VNSSM)  the state government agency to tackle farm crisis  said if its tomatoes in Nagpur, in Yavatmal farmers have ended up in losses in brinjal and ladyfinger.The rates of main crops like soyabean and cotton are already down. Now, there is a slump in vegetables which are grown to supplement income by farmers. There is no system of MSP for vegetables, he said.Farmers having irrigation facilities used to go for crops like wheat or gram. These days, vegetables are being preferred as well. This has led to a glut in Wardha. Farmers are not able to recover expenses in cauliflower cultivation, said Vijay Jawandhia, a former Shetkari Sanghathana activist from Wardha.Vijay Ingle from Akola, a farmer who had bagged state government award for best practices, also confirmed that in his area farmers were setting aside an acre or half for vegetables. The rates are down due to oversupply, he said.Meanwhile, Nandkishore Gaur, president of vegetable traders at Kalamna Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) yard, said rates are expected to increase in the coming months.Tomatoes are reaped for four months, so farmers have a chance to recover their losses. Normally, the crop is grown in the month of October. However, these days large number of farmers in areas like Ramtek and Tumsar Road in Nagpur district have gone for the January crop, which will continue till April.

He had perfected guerilla warfare, both in public and on social media networks, with startling allegations as his preferred ammunition. Politicians feared him, because in this era and time, allegations carry more value.Kejriwal and his colleagues, in early 2016, had hurled an allegation against Shiromani Akali Dal leader Bikram Singh Majithia , who promptly filed a defamation suit. It is far easier to dabble in innuendoes than proving it in a court of law. Cornered by law and litigation, Kejriwal has apologised, albeit two years later. Majithia appears to have accepted the apology and promised to withdraw the defamation case.Are apologies enough to mend damaged reputations? Does delay in tendering apology take away from sincerity and intent behind the regret? What about social media networks, especially Twitter, where all and sundry hurl innuendoes, abuses and allegations like tomatoes in Spains La Tomatina ? Should there be a special law to deal with social media networks? In India, where a dragging defamation case adds salt to wounded reputation, Sections 499 and 500 of IPC (criminal defamation) or a civil suit for damages are no solution to rein in disparaging comments on social media hurled from fake handles. In India, apologies come not from the heart or conviction, but only when the offender gets cornered by litigation or political expediency.For the November 1984 anti-Sikh carnage, it took Congress more than 20 years to issue an apology. Then PM Manmohan Singh had said in 2005, I have no hesitation in apologising to the Sikh community. For the 2002 post-Godhra riots, a formal apology is yet to come though Narendra Modi had said in 2013, Anyway you look at it, it was a shameful blot on the image of Vibrant Gujarat.In legal circles, apologies are not considered an acceptable method to avoid legal consequences in a defamation case, though it may help reduce the rigour of penalty. This is because an apology may assuage hurt but not mend the damaged reputation.Indian constitutional courts, in general, let off a person facing contempt proceedings for disparaging remarks against a judge or judiciary, if the person tenders unqualified and unconditional apology. In defamation cases, an apology reflecting that the offender is sorry and says so publicly helps release the steam. But apology has many hues and contexts  from simply saying sorry to acknowledging the wrongdoing and taking full responsibility for the fallout.In the famous New York Times vs Sullivan case, the US Supreme Court in 1964 imposed a higher standard for a public servant to seek damages against a person who makes defamatory remarks against her/him. Under this standard, public official plaintiff must show that the defendant acted with knowledge that the allegations were false or made with reckless disregard of truth.But 10 years later, the same US SC in Gertz vs Robert Welch refused to extend the same standard to defamation cases involving private individuals, saying they were more vulnerable to injury from defamation. The crux of this judgment was public officials had an opportunity to rebut fallacies, which was not available to private individuals. Last year, UKs High Court of Justice, Queens Bench Division, gave a trend-setting judgment in Jackie Monroe vs Katie Hopkins , which will serve as a lesson for Twitter gladiators with hired troll armies across the world.Monroe sued Hopkins for a disparaging tweet that featured during a war of words over Twitter after the Conservative Party formed government in May 2015 followed by a violent anti-austerity demonstration which vandalised Memorial to the Women of World War II in Whitehall. Indians, who often come across virulently disparaging tweets, will find Hopkinss tweet harmless and ignorable. After vandalisation of the memorial, Hopkins tweeted, @MsJackMonroe scrawled on any memorials recently? Vandalised the memory of those who fought for your freedom. Grandma got any more medals? It was re-tweeted several times and Monroe was trolled heavily. In reply, Monroe tweeted, I have never scrawled on a memorial. Brother in RAF. Dad was a Para in the Falklands. You are a piece of shit.The exchanges thereafter reflected Monroe requesting Hopkins to delete the abusive tweet, followed by a demand for an apology and a donation of 5,000 pounds for charity.Hopkins deleted the tweet two hours later, did not donate, and posted another tweet, Can someone explain to me - in 10 words or less - the difference between irritant @PennyRed and social anthrax @Jack Monroe Monroe sued Hopkins after newspapers published articles on the unsavoury exchange.Hopkins later tried to make amends by posting a tweet, partially on the lines suggested by Monroe, to admit she was confused about the identity and that she got it wrong. Dissatisfied, Monroe continued with the proceedings. The UK HC rejected Hopkinss defence that the tweet was deleted after two hours and had limited public life. It said, Any tweet disappears from readers view as time goes on. But this is a weak point. What matters, when considering transience, is not the period of time for which a person is exposed to the message but the impact the message has. It is a commonplace of experience that live broadcasts can have a powerful impact even if the viewer sees them only once. Print copies of newspapers are not often read more than once.The HC was also unimpressed by Hopkinss I got it wrong tweet shorn of apology and was convinced that she caused serious harm to Monroes reputation. It asked Hopkins, who had not responded to the 5,000 pounds donation demand, to pay 24,000 pounds as damages to Monroe.To check unguided missiles and hired troll armies, Indian courts need to take a leaf out of the UK HCs decision."

The rising temperature has caused a fall in groundwater level and reduced crop yield. The Koyambedu wholesale vegetable market, which used to receive 400-450 truckloads of vegetables every day three months ago, received only 350 loads on Friday.In three months, the price of green beans has gone up from Rs15-Rs20 per kg to Rs30-Rs50 per kg at the Koyambedu market. At neighbourhood retail stores, green beans was selling for Rs60 per kg on Friday.Yield from the years second crop (April to June) is 30% less than the yield from first crop which is harvested from December to March. Prices of tomato, beetroot, cauliflower, radish and turnip have increased by about 30%, while prices of onion, sambar onion, capsicum and brinjal have decreased marginally. Prices of all vegetables will rise from the third week of April by 10%, according to Koyambedu Wholesale Traders Welfare Association treasurer P G M Sukumar.Sukumar said, Prices began to go up from the first week of March last year due to a failed monsoon. This year, however, prices will only rise gradually, thanks to sufficient rainfall. Except for coastal Andhra, all other parts of the southern peninsula registered normal rainfall during the recent northeast monsoon.Prices of tomato in April last year was Rs18, while this year it is only Rs10-Rs12. Likewise, the price of carrot was Rs35 last year compared to Rs15-Rs20 this year."

But for the bulk orders, we have to make eight-ten packages at a time, which is very time consuming. Business has slowed down by 40% due to this, said vendor Hazrat Haldewale Meanwhile, several vendors have alternatively started stocking cloth bags worth Rs 10 or Rs 20, depending on size, although the move has not yet worked out in their favour. Customers will not purchase a bag worth Rs 10 to carry greens worth Rs 20. People must also be advised by the government to carry bags from home, said vendor Hyder Ali.While vegetable vendors are still managing to function, those who sell of pulses and grains are in bigger trouble. The government should have thought of an alternative for businesses like ours. We approached the CCP and they said to charge people for paper bags. Doing that will further decrease our customers, since they will prefer to go to the mall and buy readymade packets of rice instead of coming to the market. We have already seen a 45% decrease in profits after the ban, said vendor Nitin Mandrekar Many others, however, are very optimistic about this change. Miramar-resident Joseph Ferrao said, In olden days we used to carry our own bag to the market. Now, that good practice is making a comeback.We sell high-value vegetables like cherry tomatoes whose cost goes up in hundreds per kilogram. Customers dont mind paying an extra Rs 10 to purchase a cloth bag. We make Rs 5 on the bag, so the ban has actually worked in our favour, said vendor Sadiq Shaikh.Naomi M from Pilerne said, The services of some self-help groups must be utilised to make and provide newspaper bags. They are very common in Mumbai and the practice can be adopted here as well. The vendors can charge a nominal amount for it. This way, plastic bags are replaced, paper is recycled and someone gains employment."

When I checked the root, it looked as if it had galls. Galls are knot-like structures caused by root-knot nematodes. But, we were not sure about it as root-knot nematodes in citrus were not present in Tamil Nadu, she said.Poornima visited the farm and dug up a live sapling. We found that the sapling was infected with root-knot nematodes. In the past few months, we found instances of root-knot nematode infections in citrus saplings in farms in Coimbatore and Erode districts. Researchers here are working on battling the nematode, she said.Nematodes enter the roots of fruit, vegetable and flower saplings through the root tip. After two to three months, they breed and block the conducting vessels of the plant, causing it to wilt. Root-knot nematodes, meanwhile, enter the roots, where they lay eggs, which form knot-like structures that bulge out of the root. The knots then rupture and the young nematodes go in search of new roots.Nematodes mainly affect fruit and vegetable crops such as tomato, guava, pomegranate, cucumber and capsicum, said Poornima. Tomato and cucumber plants are the major victims, she added.There are also instances where there have been heavy losses in guava, said the head of nematology department, S Subramanian. Over the past four to five years, several new varieties of guava were introduced in the state. They have been affected by nematodes and have caused severe losses to farmers, he added. The annual loss in fruit crops due to nematodes was pegged at 13%, he said.The department has been researching how to tackle the nematode menace and also has been helping farmers and nursery owners. Beneficial fungi such as Paecilomyces and Pochonia are known to inhibit nematode growth, said Poornima. We have been producing the fungi and selling it to farmers. The fungi can be mixed with soil or the saplings can be dipped in the liquid formation of the fungi before being planted. Also, simple methods such as exposing the soil to sunlight will kill nematodes, she added.The department has been conducting awareness workshops on nematodes for both farmers and nursery owners, Poornima added."

According to police, Dalia used to siphon off the daily collections of Mirch Masala and the royalty amount of Tomatos.A police official said that to show the siphoned off money in books of accounts, Dalia made duplicate fixed deposit receipts and forged bank statements to show them to the owners. Police sources said that Dalia even forged signatures of the owners of the company and increased overdraft limit to Rs 90 lakh. Dalia withdrew Rs 87 lakh through overdraft facility and kept the owners in dark. Police said that the accused indulged in fraudulent activities since 2011 which came to light in September 2016 when the owners asked him to transfer Rs 36 lakh from the fixed deposit to Ahmedabad. The company wanted the money to buy furniture for its new restaurant in Ahmedabad.According to police complaint filed by the CMD of AHPL Rushad Ginwala , the scam had come to light when Dalia did not transfer the money for several days and stopped answering calls. When the companys account manager and general manager approached Corporation Bank in the city, they learnt that no fixed deposits were made, instead the company owes Rs 87 lakh to the bank which were withdrawn by Dalia as overdraft.Officials at Gotri police station said that Dalia was on run for 18 months and was nabbed on Friday. On Saturday, a judicial magistrates court sent him to police custody for eight days for investigation."

The initiative was conceived earlier this year by teachers to encourage students to be senitive to the environment.The school has started an eco-club and roped in students as members. Manoj Kumar, head teacher, said, I joined the school nine months ago. At that time, there was not a single plant in the school. So, we asked students to go to neighbouring areas and collect old plants.Students managed to collect at least 170 plants in a week after which the school got in touch with Give me trees, a Delhi-based NGO which focuses on community-based voluntary tree planting and conservation. The trust asked us if hydroponic plantation could be introduced in the school and we agreed to do the same, said Kumar.Give me trees roped in Honda, which donated Rs 3.5 lakh from its CSR funds for the project. Vaneet Bhalla, a volunteer with Give me trees, said, The concept of hydroponics is new in the country but it gives big results. It involves growing healthy plants without the use of a traditional soil medium, using a nutrient and mineral-rich water solution. Hydroponic plantation requires less water in comparison to the traditional way. A hydroponic plant needs some nutrients, water, and sunlight and all this is available in the school.The school chose its rooftop to set up the garden. The plants are put on pipes. This requires less space as the plants grow vertically, said Bhalla.Students look after the plants. Vegetables such as cabbage, capsicum, green chilli, ladys finger and tomato are grown. When the vegetables are fully grown, we will distribute them among students, said Kumar.The system requires the school to ensure water circulation through hydroponic pipes. The school makes two teachers stay in the school overnight to switch on the motor when water supply is there. The school has eight teachers. We dont have helpers such as gardeners or guards. So, we decided to take care of this ourselves. We stay in the school to switch on the motor in the evening and early morning. We also sprinkle organic pesticides on the plants, said Manjeet Mann , a teacher.The school plans to increase the number of hydroponic plants to 3,500 in the next couple of days. Sub-divisional magistrate Sanjeev Singhla said, I really appreciate the work students have done to grow soil-less plants. Other schools should also encourage this initiative."

Prices of regular varieties like rohu, katla, tangra and pabda have shot up by Rs 75-150 a kg following a surge in demand.While fish has always been a part of the daily diet of an average Bengali household, now even other communities, who prefer meat for their dietary needs, have suddenly discovered their love for fish. In Bengali households where mutton and chicken dishes usually figure on the Sunday menu, it has been fish all the way these past couple of weeks.Not just homes, even restaurants and caterers have reported a shift from mughlai, continental and Chinese cuisines to Bengali that has a wide variety of fish dishes on the menu.Price of fish across categories has gone up by 17-20% in the wholesale market. It is a record high. We have never traded fish at this price, said Howrah Wholesale Fish Market Association secretary Syed Anwar Maqsood.The rise in fish prices in the wholesale market has translated to an even steeper hike in retail prices, but the demand surge has not led to a supply shortage. State fisheries minister Chandrakanta Sinha confirmed there was enough supply in the market to meet the demand. Yet, prices have continued to soar.At municipal markets in Gariahat, Lake Market, New Market and Manicktala, price of katla has shot up from Rs 240 a kg a couple of weeks ago to Rs 350-400. Rohu has gone up from Rs 130 to Rs 160-170.Market observers put the sharp hike in prices to opportunism at the retail end. A retail fish seller senses the demand and accordingly hikes the price to maximise his profit. That is whats happened, said Jagannath Raut of Behala wholesale fish market.Caterers are having a harrowing time with clients demanding major changes in the menu at the 11th hour. According to Sandip Das of Diamond Caterer, mutton and chicken items have nearly disappeared from the menu. Now everyone is demanding that meat items be replaced by fish and prawn. This has thrown the costing of dishes haywire, said Das.We are reinventing a lot of fish dishes to stay afloat, said Sujoy Ghosh of Bhawanipores Ghosh Caterers. Reshmi kebab and mutton do peyazja have been replaced with prawn cutlet and fish coriander. Baked tomato betki has edged out roast mutton.In restaurants, too, fish and prawn items are moving faster than usual. Peter Cat and Mocambo owner Nitin Kothari said the slump in demand for chicken and mutton items was significant.Metro Cash and Carry, the leading business-to-business wholesaler that supplies both meat and fish to most big hotels and restaurants in the city, has also experienced a sharp rise in demand for fish."

Apart from coriander, cauliflower too has gone beyond the reach of middle class families, putting extensive pressure on household budgets. On the other hand, prices of the most consumed vegetables like tomato, onion, brinjal, and okra have gone down due to surplus growth of the crops in farms across northern India.Joginder Singh, one of the vendors in the citys busiest vegetable market, said due to bad weather conditions across the northern parts of the country, vegetable prices may increase in the coming days, but at present, the prices of most consumed vegetables are under control, and so people were satisfied with the prices. However, prices of a few other vegetables continued to remain high, as they are mostly transported from far-off places.Another vendor, Shambu Parsad, said due to lower vegetables prices of the most consumed vegetables, vendors were facing hardship dealing with their daily needs. One of the reasons behind the price increase of healthy vegetables like broccoli, peas, and capsicum was due to the fact that they are mostly grown in cold places, so as winter ends, the prices shoot up.Meanwhile, residents  especially women  who have to run their kitchens were not much upset, as the prices of most vegetables were not very high these days.

Three months on, they have some reason to cheer. Wholesale potato prices now range from Rs 9 to Rs 22 a kilogram and are not expected to slide anytime soon. As demand rises, market experts feel prices will rise further, by up to 60%.One reason is that the quantity of potatoes in cold storage is currently 20% less than last year. Officials said that potatoes are currently commanding higher prices than onions and tomatoes. The wholesale price of onions currently ranges between Rs 3.50 and Rs 9 per kilogram, while tomatoes are selling for between Rs 6 and Rs 9 a kilogram.Potato prices have been rising for a fortnight and market officials believe they will climb further. We are seeing wide fluctuations in the wholesale market. Any tightening of supply will raise prices further, says Deepak Patel , secretary of the Ahmedabad Agricultural Produce Market Committee.Market officials met traders who said prices will not rise if demand remains at the same level, Patel said.Ashish Guru, president of the Gujarat Cold Storage Association , says, There are at least one crore 50-kg bags fewer at cold storages in Gujarat compared to 2017. Further, Uttar Pradesh, a major potato producing state, has registered a fall in production. Farmers have not been getting remunerative prices for their produce and have hence moved away potato to more lucrative crops.Guru said the Gujarat government last year gave Rs 40 as subsidy to potato farmers. Only 4.09 crore 50-kg bags have been stored this year. The number was 5.10 crore bags in 2017. Cold storage capacity in the state is 5.75 crore bags.Guru said the drop in potato production this year has brought some relief to farmers at the cost of higher prices for consumers.According to potato traders, farmers in major potato producing states collectively reduced the acreage sown with the tuber last year by 5% to 7%, after two straight years of gluts in the market. The reduced acreage has led to a 10% to 20% fall in potato output."

The glut has led to a dip in the price of several veggies, said Rahul Tanwar, president of Muhana fruit and vegetable wholesale sellers association.He added that prices of tomatoes have dropped from Rs 20 to Rs 6-8 per kilogramme in a span of three days. Earlier, there was a farmers agitation which affected the veggie supply to the city; many farmers were also not able to sell their produces in mandi. There was a general assumption that there is a shortage in the city, hence, farmers from nearby areas like Bassi and Kaladera started coming to Muhana to sell their produces, Tanwar said.The dealers told TOI that many of the rural vegetable and fruit shops like in Bassi and Chomu have seen business being affected due to the stir, causing severe losses to the farmers. The temperature is soaring; therefore farmers cannot store their produces for a very long time. If they dont sell vegetables soon, they will have to face losses, said Ajay, a fruit seller at Lal Kothi market.The retailers said that while there is a glut of certain vegetables, the decline in prices wouldnt last long. The prices of raw mango was between Rs 15 to Rs 16 kg, but it has come down to Rs 5 kg in the wholesale. Its current retail prices are still near Rs 20 kg, Ajay said.The major chunk of the vegetables this time has come from nearby cities. Every day several vehicles are coming to Muhana mandi due to which prices have dropped, Tanwar said."

He begins stalking her. After a few days of resistance, the girl gives in and Roadsidehas his way.This may be the standard plot of Indian cinemas -- with the audience hooting and cheering the hero on, when he does so -- but few realize the devastating effect it has on women when some brainless desperados start emulating this plot in real life.A 25-year-old woman working as an auditor in a private firm went through a horrendous time when she moved tofrom Berhampur () some nine months back. It started with some unknown persons ringing the bell and running away but soon spiralled into house invasion, spraying of noxious substances and writing love letters with tomato ketchup.So much so that the hapless woman has left the city temporarily and will vacate the house -- where she lives with her brother -- once she returns. Before leaving for her hometown, she filed a complaint with the Madiwala police. A case has been lodged under section 354-D (which deals with punishment for a person who follows a woman and contacts, or attempts to contact, her to foster personal interaction repeatedly despite a clear indication of disinterest) of the Indian Penal Code.The brother-sister duo stay on the second floor of a multi-storied building at Venkatapura, in Madiwala. In his complaint, the brother has said that although his sister moved in with him nine months back, the desperados have been troubling her for the past two months. My sister is traumatised. She has fallen sick after inhaling some noxious spray that the perverts sprayed on her a couple of days ago. I took her home after getting her treated for stomach pain and fever, the brother, who did not wish to be named, told Mirror.The incident that he is referring to took place on May 22 at 10.40 am. While his sister Divya (name changed) was in the washroom, the perverts climbed the building and sprayed some chemical even as they Main Maar Doonga (I will kill) in Hindi. Divya managed to drag herself out of the bathroom and called her friend who stays nearby and her brother who was in office at that time. Her friend reached the house but Divya had bolted it from inside. My sister was not able to get up and open the door. I reached home and managed to get inside to find her very sick. We took her to the hospital and then filed a complaint with the police, her brother said.Divya said she works the night shift and trouble generally starts when her brother leaves for office in the morning. I sleep during the day. For the past two months, somebody had been ringing the bell between 10.30 am and 2 pm. But when I open the door, there would be nobody. The pattern used to repeat every three to four days. But it doesnt happen on Sundays when my brother is home, she added.The brother-sister duo even tried to catch the culprits red-handed, with disastrous, near-fatal results. I had taken my sister out shopping and decided to catch them when we returned home. I stayed back in the opposite building while my sister stood in the corridor outside our main door. Two youths in their mid-twenties appeared and my sister raised an alarm. They pushed her from behind and she almost fell from the corridor but managed to balance herself by holding on to the parapet. I rushed to catch the duo but couldnt find them, he said. After the incident, they approached the Madiwala police who checked the building and suspicious persons around it. When they found nothing, they asked us to call them if we found the miscreants again, he said.He then installed two CCTV cameras in the corridor. But they did not come for at least three days. Then, my sister found a letter in the bathroom; it had love quotes and one-liners written with tomato ketchup. They started dropping letters from bathroom window daily. Once they wrote 2 camera ha ha, he said, adding the quotes were in English, Telugu and Kannada. Next day we got another letter warning us of dire consequences if we complained to the police. After five days, there was a rotten smell in the bathroom; initially, my sister suspected it to be gas leakage or acid cleaning. After a couple of days, she again noticed the putrid smell, he said. We dont know if someone known to us is doing this, but they are observing my sisters movements and targeting her. She is scared it could be black magic too, he added.Madiwala police said they had collected CCTV footage from the building and will nab the miscreants at the earliest.Till then, Divyas nightmare will continue; just like Kirans (played by Juhi Chawla) in Darr."

But he eventually spent more time studying chemistry and obtained his PhD in 1899.Sorensen did most of his research in Carlsberg Laboratories. He became the director of its chemical section in 1901. While at Carlsberg, Sorensen started to study amino acids, proteins and enzymes.As hydrogen ion concentration played a key role in enzymatic reactions he devised a simple way of expressing it, according to EuCheMS, the European Association for Chemical and Molecular Sciences.He found that by taking a negative logarithm of hydrogen ion concentration a convenient scale can be established. This is the well-known pH value.He also developed buffer solutions to maintain constant pH of solutions (Sorensen buffers), EuCheMS noted in a short biography of the scientist in its website.The Google Doodle on Tuesday allows users to see for themselves the pH value of different food items, including tomatoes and eggs in a scale of 1 to 14.Sorensen retired from his post at Carlsberg in 1938.

You can have them scrambled, boiled, curried, poached, baked, basted, fried sunny side up and even whisked raw in coffee. Additionally, they play the role of binder, thickener, emulsifier and vitalizer. Want to give definition and bounce to your hair? Simply slap an egg on your scalp!As a protein source, eggs are a delight for both weight-watchers and those building muscle. But none desires eggs more than the hungry soul who is either low on budget or shorn of a wholesome eating option late at night.Shabbir Shaikh comes to the rescue here. The 39-year-old has been running a handcart selling egg dishes outside the Shivajinagar railway station for the past 20 years. He conducts business till 3am, moving his cart into a nondescript lane adjoining the station after midnight.On an average, Shaikh uses 300 eggs daily but sticks to just three dishes  bhurji, omelette and half fry (renamed palti if flipped over). Each dish, which comes with four pavs, is priced at Rs 50 till midnight and Rs 60 thereafter. Interestingly, Shaikh says rail and bus passengers are not his chief clientele  word of mouth about his food draws in regular customers from as far as Pimpri and Hinjewadi.Like Shaikh, most stalls and handcarts in the city restrict their egg menu to not more than four or five dishes. Yash Pawar, owner of Pune Egg Cafe on Senapati Bapat Road, says this is very unlike Gujarat, especially Surat and Vadodara, where stalls have around 25-30 different egg dishes on their list.The 24-year-old Pawar, who grew up in Vadodara and came here to study at Symbiosis, has more than 50 egg items on his menu, with the average pricing being Rs 100. He says his chef, who is from Vadodara, can rustle up 300 types of egg dishes. Pawar offers eggs in rice, gravies and parathas, and as starters or omelettes. His trademark dishes are the ghotala (of Surat fame), boiled egg tikka masala and egg-kheema rice. And, yes, the place satisfies late-night food cravings.Pawar says he uses only Amul butter for his dishes. So does Dnyaneshwar Narvankar, the franchise owner of the newly-started eggs-only Raju Omlet at Vimannagar. Now, the Omlet is no typo; it has been retained in the name boards of all 12 outlets of the brand  six of them in Gujarat and one each in Mumbai, Pune, Dubai, Sharjah, Pattaya and the US.All outlets have a fixed menu of 13 dishes, and each dish uses 50 gms of butter. The dishes are priced up to Rs 170, and the best-sellers are the green boiled egg tikka and the crush omelette. Narvankar says the outlets do not believe in experimenting with too many dishes, though he points out that one can find more than 1,000 egg recipes across Gujarat. The Vadodara outlet, from where the business started, uses a whopping 1,500 eggs a day.At Sangvi, Shriram Pawar operates a food truck which offers 111 egg dishes from evening to midnight. The 34-year-old, who spent a year in a similar business in Surat, claims to be the only one in Maharashtra to offer the intriguingly-named egg pomfret. Well, this dish is basically an omelette fried adequately to earn a texture like the skin of a fish. The omelette is then folded and shaped like a pomfret. It is stuffed with chopped cooked egg whites and cheese before being dunked into a plateful of tomato-based gravy.Pawar, who uses around 200 eggs per day, says each of his myriad dishes has a unique taste. An exhaustive menu like his would be found in many places in Gujarat, he points out. There, eggs have an acceptability factor among the largely vegetarian population, even though they may not be eaten at home."

Hira Singh Vegetable Wholesale Market, locally known as Azadpur mandi, said prices of tomatoes, onions, and potatoes had increased.Disruption in supplyThe vendors said potato stock was influenced the least and the price of onions rose only slightly. However, tomato sellers complained of disruption in supply.Subhas Seti, a tomato vendor for the past 47 years, said while 70 vehicles is the norm, only 12 made deliveries on June 2, the second day of the protest. Other wholesalers had similar experiences.Dashrat Kumar, a vendor at Azadpur mandi for the past 12 years, said the supply of tomatoes was considerably low on June 2. He said the price of tomatoes almost doubled when only five of the usual 50 trucks of produce arrived.Anil Kumar, a tomato seller since 1990, sold his stock for Rs. 15 per kg, Rs. 5 higher than last week, because only four of a total of 40 supply trucks were on duty. When asked about the reason for such few trucks, he said the drivers were worried about local agitation and damage to their vehicles in transit.Vendors sympathiseDespite the disruption in vegetable supplies, many vendors at Azadpur mandi sympathised with the farmers.Although Mohammed Javed, a potato vendor, reported an approximate 10% reduction in stock, he said, The farmers are not getting enough money so it is natural that they will be upset and want to strike.While potato prices have not fluctuated significantly, those working with commission agents, like Javed, have suffered losses. The commission agents responded to the strike by increasing their rate of commission by about Rs. 4 per kg, added Javed and other potato sellers at Azadpur mandi. However, many vegetable retailers in the city did not report any significant price fluctuations. Dinesh Kumar, a retailer in Razapur, said, As of now, there is no change in the rate of tomatoes and onions.Asked about what the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) in Delhi was doing to ameliorate the situation, APMC chairperson Adil Ahmad Khan said, What will the APMC do?

I hope that is the correct spelling of achhe and its not achhoo as my autocorrect is suggesting. My father says the right spelling is chee but I think he is editorialising.So wherever you are, whoever you are, extend both your arms  dont feel shy, this is a time to celebrate  and pat yourselves on the back. If you cant reach your own back because you are too fat, do it using your social media handle, or the handle of your trishul. But do it for sure  because you deserve it.A ridiculous notionYou silly goose! Deserve it my foot! I was just joking, to see how seriously you take me. And you all are really patting yourselves on the back?! This has to be the height of self-delusion. Do you people really believe the credit for all that India has achieved in the last four years goes to each one of you? I am asking a genuine question here and I want a genuine answer: are all of you megalomaniacs? Did you really think each of you is collectively responsible for the progress of this great nation? I am shocked to hear that you would entertain even for one second such a ridiculous, blasphemous notion. Never forget that all the good things happening in our country right now is because of one man  and we all know who that is.What makes me really sad is that all of you got four years  four entire years  to fulfil every one of our beloved Prime Ministers dreams. And yet, you have let him down so badly. Each one of you. True, the Indian economy is still growing at 12.7% per annum, we are still creating 4.2 crore jobs every year, and farmers are so happy that they are giving away milk and tomatoes for free. It is also true that we have eliminated corruption through demonetisation, achieved 200% tax compliance through GST, and deposited Rs. 15 lakh in the bank account of every Indian who worked in the IT Cell for a minimum of 56 days.Nor can anyone deny that today, white people in different parts of the world look at brown Indians with more respect than ever before. Foreigners are so much in awe of our Prime Minister that when they translate his speeches they add five extra paragraphs free of charge. After 60 years of Dark Ages under the Congress, today every Indian village has woken up to light and Paytm.Four great featsIn fact, Modiji routinely achieves in any given week 100 times more than what Nehru accomplished from 1947 to 2014. But the pseudo-sickular Indian media that has sold out to the hate-Modi industry simply wont show them to the Indian public. If you think I am being too harsh, Ill give you just four examples of Modijis historic achievements, all from the last one week, which have been completely blacked out by the paid-cum-stung media.Im betting you didnt know, for instance, that for the first time in Indias 30,000-year-history, an orchid was named after an Indian Prime Minister when the Singapore government decided to name a beautiful Indic orchid that produces upright inflorescences up to 56 inches long, Dendrobrium Narendra Modi. Or that Modiji became the first Indian Prime Minister to visit a Mariamman temple in Singapore. Were you aware that the IAEA has hailed the achievement of electrifying all Indian villages as the greatest event in the history of every energy, including physical, kinetic, potential, sexual, and weed energy? Or that for the first time in Indias history, an Indian Prime Minister purchased a Madhubani painting in Singapore using a RuPay card? Do you know how many Madhubani paintings Nehru bought using a RuPay card, either in India or in Singapore? Zero. Thats right. If Modiji and Nehru were to settle things between them through a tennis match, Modiji would win by an innings and 545 runs.The one thing we couldnt doThats the kind of Prime Minister weve been blessed with the last four years  someone who not only works 23 hours a day but never boasts about it in his own words. In return, he had only one small request for all of us: a Congress-mukt Bharat. And Im sorry to say, as a nation, we have failed miserably in this.As the Karnataka elections and the recent bypoll results showed, not only is India far from being Congress-mukt, the entire Opposition is ganging up against one man. And you all are sitting quietly and watching like Gandhijis monkeys? After all that he has done for you, if you cant even ensure another five years of Achhe Din in 2019, I must say you are not fit to remain in this country. I suggest you pack off to Pakistan and while you are there, dont forget to watch Veeradi Veera Wedding with your jihadi grandmother."

Each packet would contain a minimum of five varieties of vegetable seeds. We are making the seed sourcing and processing facility a permanent mechanism to help the State achieve vegetable self-sufficiency. Quality seeds would be supplied to all the needy, including farmers, schools, institutions, households and NGOs, said Thomas Cheriyan, manager of the processing plant of the VFPCK at Alathur here.The agency, which completed 21 years this month, will soon start a Statewide campaign promoting organic vegetable cultivation. Talking to The Hindu , Thomas Cherian said the State needs quality seeds and seedlings to achieve self-sufficiency in cultivation of pesticide-free vegetables.50% deficitThe State now faces a 50% deficit in its vegetable requirements. We are attempting to bridge the gap, he said.The packing of seeds for distribution among students has been conducted using the services of 2,000 women volunteers of Kudumbasree. All the 13 seed-packing centres in the region would be converted into permanent entities.Ensuring supplyApart from seeds, the VFPCK would ensure the supply of vermicompost, coir pith compost, powdered cow dung, cow urine, panchagavya, fish amino acid, EM solution, neem cakes, bone meal, grow bag, and seedling trays to vegetable growers.600 tonnes of seedIn its 21 years of existence, the council has generated and supplied around 600 tonnes of seeds from the Alathur unit.It has also ensured Palakkad the prime position on the vegetable cultivation map of Kerala."

This used to be a one-and-done ordeal... However, with Ghostbusters , Hollywood took a big swing on a female-led project, and didnt overreact to its failure, he wrote.The premise of What Women Want (2000)  Mel Gibson as a marketing executive who is suddenly able to hear womens thoughts  lends itself more obviously to a gender-flipped remake than most.Taraji P. Henson, who does the honours in What Men Want (2019), said her role was an empowering statement for women, but also a learning experience.You kind of just brush it off as men like sex, eating and farting. I was like, How are they going to make this interesting? said the Empire and Hidden Figures star. But then I read the script and Im like, Wow, men are really insecure about their looks, just like women! I think thats going to be great, for women to see that.Ensemble of womenSome Hollywood watchers have argued that while female-flipping may seem progressive, in reality it militates against those really fighting pay inequality, harassment and other forms of sexism.Even though I can get excited for a movie like Oceans 8 ... at the end of the day it still seems to signify that womens movies still need some sort of male appeal to get made, said Hazel Cills of female-focused pop culture website Jezebel.A gender-swapped movie implies that women arent important enough to get their own, original stories, and thus must piggy-back on franchises helmed by men that have already proven to be successful.It was an issue that came up when Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett and the rest of the Oceans 8 cast hosted a news conference at New Yorks Metropolitan Museum of Art earlier this month.Ms. Bullock admitted that initially she honestly didnt think it would work, or get made while Ms. Blanchett agreed that, a few short years ago, such a project would have been out of the question."

Orders are placed online, priced at 32 per person, from a choice of four curries, a vegetarian side dish and naan.Since Sake Dean Mohamed from Patna opened Londons first Indian restaurant called Hindoostane Coffee House in Marylebone in 1810, the Indian food industry has grown exponentially and is worth 4 billion today.It is a different matter that curry in Britain stands for dishes vastly different from what they are known as back home, and at least one Indian dish is a purely British invention: chicken tikka masala or CTM, endowed with the status of national dish by former foreign secretary Robin Cook.CTM, no surprise,is one of the four curries on offer, the others being Lamb Balti, Bangal Naga Chicken and Paneer Korai (veg). The food will be flown to Bordeaux Saucats Airfield, located in the heart of the Pessac-Lognan wine region, where it will be served to customers.James Emery, a France-based British aviation trainer who thought of the idea with Faz Ahmed of Akash, told The Times: Indian food in France is standardised for French tastes and Ive never had anything that resembles what you get in an Indian takeaway in Britain.Its a bit of a hare-brained scheme but we love flying and we love curries and we thought it would get the year off to a good start. Everything is a bit miserable, what with Brexit, and I thought it would be good to have some fun.Orders can only be placed by customers in France, organisers said. The food will be flown to Bordeaux in a Diamond DA42 aircraft operated by Iroise Aro Formation, a flying school in France.The CTM is also proving a major export item from Britain to France. Retailer Marks & Spencer has been reportedly selling ready-to-eat CTM meals at its outlets in Paris by the thousands, making the dish its top selling meal there.CTM may have Indian origins butis reputed to have been invented in 1971 by a cook in Glasgow after a customer complained that his chicken dish was dry. The cook simply poured tomato soup into the dish with some spices, the customer loved it, and CTM was born."
5b208fd09855b768c2e029dc,Seed swap  a growing trend among green thumbs,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/seed-swap-a-growing-trend-among-green-thumbs/article24131936.ece,2018-06-11,,The Hindu,"Sharing food, or even ingredients, is common. Now, however, the growing number of people who share a passion for growing their own food also share an essential component of what they produce: the seeds.Right from virtual connection on social media to physically meeting, residents of the city are slowly but surely warming up to the idea of seed sharing.This exercise not only ensures higher germination rates and less dependence on commercial sellers, but also gives novices in the field a chance to learn first-hand from the experienced on how to go green and organic, they say.Good responseAfter organising its first Seed Swap in 2017, the Backyard Factory is back with another swapping event this month. The first seed swap event was well appreciated. We had posted information about the event on Facebook and a good number of people turned up for the event at Cubbon Park. The idea was to let people bring excess seeds from their produce and share them with people who are interested in growing their own food. It was a mutual exchange. What was surprising was most of the participants were young gardening enthusiasts, said Lincy Inder, who conducts kitchen gardening workshops for schoolchildren.This time, the event will be held on June 30 at Cubbon Park, and Ms. Inder expects even better participation than the last time.While meetings are very essential for seed sharing, another group also makes good use of social media to share seeds with the community. Members of Grow Your Own Food, a Facebook community, put up details of excess seeds available with them on social media. Others can contact the group if interested. The members meet once in two months for a seed swapping event at Lalbagh.Whatever we grow, we save the seeds for ourself and to share with others, said Suresh Rao, a member of the group.Mr. Rao said the best thing about seed sharing is that there is 100% guarantee of the seeds germinating. It is not the case with store-bought seeds. We usually share tomato, brinjal, gourd, and all types of greens during the meets, he said. The group also promotes heirloom seeds by sharing them.Explaining how the members store the excess seeds for sharing, he said, It is quite easy. From two tomatoes, 100 seeds can be obtained, which can be saved for the next season. One brinjal has around 200 seeds. Though the seed saving technique for each variety differs, it is not rocket science. During the meet-ups, we share the concepts with newcomers, Mr. Rao said.Another city-based group, Oota From Your Thota, which encourages people to grow their food organically, also organises seed swaps among members regularly.A common practiceWhile urban gardeners are just getting used to the idea of seed sharing, the practice is common among farmers, said Hemanth, farmer and member of the Facebook group Bangalore Gardening. In our farming community, seed sharing has always been a common practice. It helps reduce farmers dependence on commercially sold seeds and saves a lot of money, he says.The Horticulture Department too gives away seedlings instead of just seeds to anyone interested. After monsoon, we distribute the excess seedlings to interested people for free. Most are tree seedlings. In a year, at least 5,000 seedlings are given away, said M.R. Chandrashekar, Deputy Director, Lalbagh."

That separation is not a disease of colored people. It is a disease of white people. I do not intend to be quiet about it,"" he said during a commencement speech at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania.As a Jewish scientist who experienced anti-Semitism in Germany, Einstein showed deep sympathy for black people in America. He wandered around black neighborhoods in segregated Princeton, New Jersey, his home after leaving Germany amid the rise of the Nazis, sat on people's porches, chatted with them, and handed out candies to their children and grandchildren. He had become so entrenched in America's civil rights movement that the FBI placed him under surveillance, collecting nearly 1,500 pages of documents on Einstein by the time he died.But there's another side to Einstein that perhaps people did not know then.One of the travel diaries he wrote during a months-long voyage in the 1920s reveals that in his private moments, the Nobel-winning physicist portrayed people of other races, such as Chinese and Indians, in a stereotypical, dehumanizing way. Einstein's unfiltered musings about the people he saw and interacted with during his journey show that even the civil rights icon and ""paragon"" of humanitarianism harbored racist thoughts about those who did not look like him, said Ze'ev Rosenkranz, senior editor and assistant director of the Einstein Papers Project at the California Institute of Technology.""In published statements, he's usually in favor of civil and human rights and was socially progressive. I'm not saying that he didn't believe in those things,"" Rosenkranz said, but he added that the words Einstein never intended to be published are in stark contrast with his more-guarded public statements.That contradiction makes Einstein all the more human, said Rosenkranz, who edited ""The Travel Diaries of Albert Einstein,"" published recently by Princeton University Press.""I'm not apologizing for him or anything . . . I still feel that the unpleasant remarks are quite shocking, but they do reveal that we all have this darker side to our attitudes and prejudices,"" he said.Einstein wrote the travel diary from October 1922 to March 1923, when he and wife Elsa traveled by ship to the Mediterranean, Sri Lanka, China and Japan. He wrote every day about his surroundings, at times writing as if he was in a hurry. ""Radiant day. Sea quiet, almost windless,"" he wrote Oct. 12, 1922. Other times, he is more detailed: ""In the evening, wonderful sunset - purple with finely illuminated narrow wind-swept clouds,"" he wrote on the same day.He also chronicled his observations of people he saw and met, summing up ""their personalities and idiosyncrasies in just a few, often humorous or irreverent, words,"" Rosenkranz wrote in the introduction portion of the travel diary.The average Japanese, Einstein wrote, is ""unproblematic, impersonal, he cheerfully fulfills the social function which befalls him without pretension, but proud of his community and nation. Forsaking his traditional ways in favor of European ones does not undermine his national pride.""While Einstein used male pronouns for deeper reflections about the Japanese, his thoughts about women were more about their physical appearance than their personality. Japanese women, he wrote as he observed them on the ship, ""look ornate and bewildered . . . Black-eyed, black-haired, large-headed, scurrying.""His reflections about the Chinese, with whom he spent far less time, were more callous, even insulting. Though he called the Chinese ""industrious,"" he also described them as ""filthy"" and ""obtuse."" They're a ""peculiar herd-like nation,"" Einstein wrote, ""often more like automatons than people."" He saw them as intellectually inferior, quoting - instead of challenging - Portuguese teachers he met during his travels who claimed that the Chinese ""are incapable of being trained to think logically"" and ""have no talent for mathematics.""There was, as Rosenkranz described, a ""healthy dose of extreme misogyny"":""I noticed how little difference there is between men and women; I don't understand what kind of fatal attraction Chinese women possess which enthralls the corresponding men to such an extent that they are incapable of defending themselves against the formidable blessing of offspring.""His reflections in the few days he spent in China also reveal Einstein's tendency to perceive foreigners as a threat.""It would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all other races,"" he wrote. ""For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary.""In Colombo, Sri Lanka, he wrote with empathy about the beggars on the streets. He was ""very much ashamed"" for his complicity in such ""despicable treatment of human beings,"" he said. But he also was critical of them for being poor. He saw them as inferior people who ""live in great filth and considerable stench.""The Indians and Sinhalese in Colombo, Einstein said, ""do little"" and ""need little.""As he traveled in the Levant in the Mediterranean, he described Levantines as a ""screaming and gesticulating"" group of people ""of every shade."" Levantine merchants swarmed the ship, Einstein wrote, transforming the upper deck into a bazaar. He found them both repulsive and beautiful, describing them as ""bandit-like"" and ""filthy,"" but also ""handsome and graceful to look at.""About a decade after his travels, in December 1932, Einstein and his wife left Germany for a three-month trip to the United States. Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party took over the German government the following month. Einstein didn't return home and stayed in the United States, where he became more aware of the plight of African Americans. He entrenched himself in the civil rights movement, signed anti-lynching petitions and volunteered to testify as a character witness in the trial of writer and philosopher W.E.B. Du Bois.""It would be easy to say, yes, he became more enlightened,"" Rosenkranz said. But whether Einstein's racist views, particularly about the Chinese, had changed, Rosenkranz is not sure.All of this is to say that our understanding of Einstein misses his complexity as a human being, Rosenkranz said.""One should emphasize the different elements and contradictory elements in the statements that he made and in his personality,"" Rosenkranz said. ""On one hand, he was very generous and very favorable . . . But there's also these statements that one should not ignore."" What this says about human nature is that we are complex beings with both enlightened and dark beliefs, Rosenkranz said. ""We generally don't express them, but we might harbor them secretly. This gives us the opportunity to look at ourselves."""

(File)The summit lunch, which brought together 13 principals from both delegations was ""a little unexpected,"" given the early stage of the talks between the two world leaders. (Reuters)The lunch menu for the historic summit involving President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the opulent Capella resort in Singapore suggests both sides got what they wanted from Tuesday's sit-down: concessions, in the form of dishes designed to appeal to both a meat-loving American and a North Korean with more international tastes.The menu should have come with pencils for circling choices. Beneath each course were three oh-so-diplomatic options. Starters featured a prawn cocktail served with avocado salad , a steakhouse staple POTUS would probably be reassured to see; Korean stuffed cucumbers; and green mango kerabu with honey-lime dressing and fresh octopus. Kerabu, a staple of Malay cuisine, is a refreshing salad judged by the balance of sweet, sour, salty and hot notes in the dressing.BBC News reported that the stuffed cucumbers, or oiseon, caused some raised eyebrows among Koreans, given the dish's royal origins. ""It's a bit like the British prime minister sitting down to dine with a visiting dignitary and chowing down on a roasted swan - a favourite of Henry VIII,"" the news outlet declared.Wherever Trump and Asian leaders meet, beef is sure to be in the picture. Over a round of golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last November, hamburgers were served. On a trip to China last year, Trump's hosts seemed to be appealing to his affection for steak with ketchup when he was offered ""stewed beef steak in tomato sauce.""Sure enough, beef, as in short rib confit, was one of three main course selections. The entree was rounded out with steamed broccolini (doctor's orders, maybe, since Trump is said to be dieting?) and potato dauphinois, a fancier way to say potatoes au gratin, a Trump favorite. Both leaders can get around spuds. Kim, who as a teenager studied abroad in Switzerland, is said to have developed a fondness for rosti, the country's famous potato pancakes.In deference to Trump, a teetotaler, the beef's red wine sauce was listed as ""on the side."" (Kim, who has retained both Japanese sushi and Italian pizza makers, reportedly has a fondness for fine French wines.)The alternate entrees were soy-braised cod with Asian vegetables and sweet-and-sour pork with Yangzhou fried rice flavored with XO chile sauce. Was the fried rice a sly way to find a spot for China, North Korea's largest trading partner, at the table? Kim arrived in the city/state aboard a Boeing 747 operated by Air China. Multiple news sources said he brought along some of his own food and even a toilet.Dessert - the course with the power to leave a last impression - was decidedly Western. Choices included a dark chocolate tartlet; the cream- or custard-filled brioche called Tropezienne; and vanilla ice cream with cherry coulis. The scoops came from Haagen-Dazs, the only designer label flagged on the menu. Presumably, Trump didn't get his preferred double helping of ice cream.Video of guests gathering for the lunch shows pre-plated starters on a rectangular table lined down the center with soothing green- and cream-colored flowers. While Singapore was the facilitating host, Trump appeared to take command, asking photographers: ""Getting a good picture everybody? So we look nice and handsome and thin? Perfect.""Getting to ""perfect,"" or close to it, involves teams from both sides identifying the preferences and steering clear of the dislikes of the principals, says Peter Selfridge, who served as U.S. chief of protocol during the last three years of the Obama administration. Reached for comment, the former ambassador said via email, ""At first glance, it looks like rather than having to decide on one main dish that would appease both [palates] - a difficult task under normal conditions - they chose to offer something for everyone, while also giving a nod to the flavors of the host country."" Selfridge called the summit lunch, which brought together 13 principals from both delegations, ""a little unexpected,"" given the early stage of the talks between the two world leaders. Then again, he said, ""sharing a meal goes a long way to breaking the ice."""

This led to tension at some places.The protesting farmers continued to dump agricultural produce and milk in vegetable markets and on roads to show their protest, while in some villages and towns, they set up temporary stalls to sell the vegetables at throwaway prices.Vegetable prices soarIts impact at vegetable markets was visible as prices surged in absence of adequate supply.In the past couple of days, prices of some veggies  especially green vegetables  have gone up. Tomato prices have increased from Rs 10 per kg a week ago to Rs 20-25, said a seller at Sector 26 in Chandigarh.

However, it lost steam after few days as the bid of farmer organisations to block transport of milk and other essential items to cities was thwarted by police.Bharatiya Kisan Union Madhya Pradesh general secretary Anil Yadav admitted the impact of the strike was not as expected in MP, and blamed the fear of the police for its failure. The farmers do not want to get into the wrong books of police. Thousands have been forced to sign bonds of ?25,000 and BJP workers among the farmers and members of the RSS-backed Bharatiya Kisan Sangh were active in sabotaging the strike, he said.Yadav said to make the bandh a total success there will be a Bharat Bandh on June 10 in which there will be no movement of any goods from villages to towns. Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh president Shiv Kumar Sharma said they will work to make the June 10 bandh a success. We have given call for a Bharat Bandh and asked all those living in 6 lakh villages of the country not to supply anything in the towns. We have also requested traders to keep their shops closed till 2pm in our support, he said.Sharma said the biggest achievement of the strike was that despite provocation from the administration, the movement was peaceful. They threatened farmers, made them sign bonds, and were looking for an excuse to give this movement a bad name, but failed, he said, adding the impact was not as successful as expected.In a bid to support the call, the Congress in Gujarat announced its support for ongoing farmer protest seeking farm loan waiver, saying the Vijay Rupani government was in its three-day annual chintan shivir (brainstorming session) in Vadodara, and was not thinking about farm distress. The BJP government holds agricultural festival every year but, in reality, it has not addressed the real issues concerning farmers. Be it the right prices or expansion of irrigation network, the government has failed on all fronts, said Leader of Opposition Paresh Dhanani.On the first day of the Congress-backed agitation, farmers threw vegetables and spilled milk on roads, mostly in Saurashtra, central and north Gujarat. In Keshod town of Junagadh district, the party observed a day-long bandh. On last day (Sunday) of the drive, there will be dharnas and hunger strike, Dhanani added.In UPs Amroha, farmers threw tomatoes on road as part of the agitation and announced that they will not allow movement of any goods on June 10."

Police reached the spot and the milkmen had to take another route to reach the city. The two groups entered into a scuffle.Similar scenes were witnessed at Rampura Phul and on the Bathinda- Muktsar road where milkmen resorted to protest by raising slogans against them being stopped from selling their produce.Activists of the BKU (Ekta Sidhupur) had set up nakas at Jodhpur Romana near Bibiwala village on the Bathinda-Talwandi Sabo road, the Bathinda  Goniana road and on the Bathinda-Malout road.Sohan Singh, the state president of the Milkmen Union, said that they had told the farmer unions before the start of the strike that any milkmen who want to support them are free do so by not supplying milk to the city areas but no milkman should be forced to stop the supply.He said that it is not possible for the majority of the milkmen not to supply milk for 10 days.In Sangrur district also, farmers set up check-points at different places and stopped vegetable growers and dairy owners from carrying their produce to the city areas on Saturday night and on Sunday morning. Dairy owners dumped milk on the roads at Bhawanigarh, alleging that farmer unions were harassing them and milkmen. They said the activists should instead hold protests outside big milk plants.The BKU leadership, however, claimed that milkman unions are supporting their agitation. Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of a faction of BKU, said he was working to make this protest peaceful. We are getting expected response, he said.At Phagwara, a group of farmers laid siege outside the local vegetable market and did not allow trucks or tractor-trolleys carry farm produce to enter inside.A group of farmers created ruckus at the new vegetable market by forcing commission agents to shut their shops and not allowing them to sell their stock of vegetables and fruits. Police force was deployed to avoid any untoward incident.Veggie prices continue to soarPrices of various vegetables have doubled or trebled since the strike started two days back.Varinder Kumar, a vegetable seller in Jalandhar, said they are somehow managing to get vegetables from farmers or from the old stocks at mandis at double or triple rates.Tomato, which was being sold at 10 per kg three days ago, is now 30 per kg while prices of peas, brinjal, cabbage, cauliflower and other vegetables have also gone up.Not much effect in MajhaIn Majha belt, the plan to suspend the supplies of vegetables and milk failed to elicit much response as essential commodities were available in the market as usual.The Kisan Sangarsh Committee has refused to support the protest.Its Punjab convener, Kawalpreet Singh Pannu, said they will not support the protest that affects the common man."

That works out to be Rs 25-Rs 30 lakh a year, he says as he shows around his six-acre net house farm.Crops are sown in a controlled environment in a net house. Its a farm technique pioneered by Israel and has worked wonders. Satpal says growing cucumber, capsicum and tomato in his six-acre net house fetches him Rs 48-Rs 50 lakh a year. I have given the rest of my land on contract to other farmers so I earn from there also, he says.He among farmers in the state who have benefited from the Centre of Excellence (CoE) for Vegetables at Gharaunda in Karnal, an Indo-Israel project to impart technical knowhow, training and quality seedlings to farmers.Haryana has set up four CoEs under the Indo-Israel partnership, while a floriculture centre is coming up at Sondhi in Jhajjar.Horticulture director Arjun Saini says though the practice of protected cultivation was known, the intervention of Israeli experts helped improve cultivation practices. They taught them how to provide seedlings in a soil-less medium in a green house; the use of drip irrigation; nutrient management; the use of thermal nets; pollination of vegetables inside poly houses; branching and wiring of plants. It improved cultivation in poly/net house in view of the extreme weather conditions, says Saini.Catalysts of change Centre of Excellence for Vegetables, Gharaunda, KarnalEstablished in 2011 to demonstrate latest technology of vegetable cultivation in protected and open conditions. Imparts quality vegetable seedlings and practical training to farmers for protected cultivation.Centre of Excellence for Fruits, Mangiana, SirsaSet up in 2013 to demonstrate the latest technologies of fruits cultivation with different spacing, on flat and raised beds and varietal trials. Crops demonstrated include citrus varieties, olives, pomegranate, date palm varieties, guava and bael.Centre for Sub Tropical Fruits, Ladwa, KurukshetraEstablished in 2016 to demonstrate advanced technologies of horticulture to increase farm income. Crops demonstrated include mango, litchi, guava, peach, plum, olives and pomegranate.Integrated Beekeeping Development Centre, Ramnagar, KurukshetraSet up in 2017, the aim is to demonstrate advanced technologies of beekeeping, bee venom, bee propolis and other byproducts to increase farm income.Floriculture centre, Sondhi, JhajjarApproved. The objective is to demonstrate flower cultivation technologies and production of quality planting material.Satpal says he gets updates from the CoE on new varieties of seedlings and techniques.When I was growing wheat and paddy, I couldnt think of buying a vehicle. Net house farming has given me financial flexibility, he says. Satpal is now setting up a mushroom production unit next to the net house. It will cost me Rs 12 lakh as Ill get Rs 8 lakh as subsidy under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, he says. His elder son, a BTech degree holder, is studying mushroom production to run the project. My second son is studying law. I couldnt have paid for their education had I not made the switch, Satpal adds.Horticulture hubTaking a cue from his friend who grew strawberries, Arun Chauhan, 50, quit his engineering job in 1998 to return to Manouli village and start farming. For years, his family grew wheat and paddy on 30 acres, earning Rs 30,000-Rs 40,000 per acre.Chauhan wanted to do something different. He saw residents of neighbouring Aterna village grow baby corn. A private company guiding farmers there suggested he grow sweet corn. He started with a small chunk. After two years, our produce surpassed expectations, he says. This inspired others. Today my village is called the sweet corn village as every second farmer here grows it. The cost of sowing sweet corn is Rs 20,000 per acre but the returns are from Rs 1 lakh-Rs 2 lakh per acre, he says.Chauhan learned poly house farming from the CoE at Gharaunda in 2008. He set up a poly house on an acre and has now increased it to six acres. The money I get from six acres is four times higher than what I get from the 24 acres I own. I started growing lilies in the poly house and have since shifted to cherry tomatoes and seedless cucumbers. For two years, Im growing red, yellow and green bell peppers, he adds.Chauhan says a poly house set up in an acre gives him 250-300 quintals of bell peppers, which sells for Rs 10-15 lakh. The best is I dont have to go anywhere. Brands such as Dominos and Reliance Fresh come to my village and collect the vegetables, he says. Ive started growing muskmelon after CoE experts suggested a high-yield method. To maintain the poly house, the CoE has suggested we do soil solarisation by mulching and fumigation, he adds.Purchasing powerManchuri resident Surjit Singh is among those who has benefited from the CoE for vegetables. He says net house farming increased his per acre earning from Rs 6 lakh to Rs 8 lakh.I started net house farming on two acres in 2013. Gradually, I increased it to six acres, Singh said. He started growing cucumber, tomato and capsicum and says he has never faced losses despite fluctuating prices.For Surjit and his elder brother, Inderjit, who own 35 acres, life has changed in five years. Their purchasing power has increased and they no longer worry about crop loss and rising input costs. Income from six acres of net house farming is more than the 29 acres under traditional crops, he says. Many farmers have drawn inspiration from our experience and seek our help, he adds.Sandeep Kumar, 36, of Mohindipur in Karnal has also seen his income increase in two years ever since he adopted net-house farming.Sandeep, who shifted from Delhi to Karnal after his land was acquired by the government, says, Initially, I entered into the real estate business but it turned non-profitable in 2014 and I turned to growing vegetables. He started net-house farming on an acre to grow cucumber and capsicum. I earned Rs 6 lakh-Rs 7 lakh from an acre and have since increased the area under net-house farming to three acres, he adds.(Hitender Rao, Hardik Anand and Neeraj Mohan)"

Earlier, his Madhya Pradesh counterpart claimed no farmers are participating in the strike. Farmers are happy with the schemes.Farmer organisations called for a 10-day Gaon Bandh (rural shutdown) from June 1 demanding loan waivers, land reforms and higher prices for their produce. The agitation, which the organisers say will end with a nationwide shutdown on its tenth day, has brought back focus on an agrarian crisis that could, unless addressed, hurt the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) politically in elections to key states later this year and the national elections in 2019.Traders in the Chandigarh fruit and vegetable market said the prices of several vegetables such as tomatoes, potatoes, capsicum and bottle gourd had increased by Rs 10-20 a kilo.Traders in some markets in Madhya Pradesh also reported a spike in prices. There is a 30-40% drop in supplies since yesterday. Today, the wholesale prices were up by about 20%, said Amit Patidar, a trader at Neemuch fruit and vegetable market.At a few places in Madhya Pradesh, farmers put up blockades. In Petlawad town in tribal Jhabua district, farmers distributed milk and vegetables free to patients in the hospitals , refusing to sell both.Resentment among farmers is particularly strong in Madhya Pradesh  a BJP-ruled state that is among a clutch of others set for elections this winter  and Congress president Rahul Gandhi is expected to visit Mandsaur in the state, where five farmers were killed last year on June 6, while taking part in demonstrations.Anil Yadav, the union general secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union, one of the organisations coordinating the agitation, said the campaign will be amplified from next week.In Punjab, where chief minister Amarinder Singh blamed the Centre for the farm crisis, farmers protested at several places such as Nabha, Ludhiana, Muktsar, Tarn Taran, Nangal and Ferozepur and blocked supply of vegetables and milk entering cities.According to the Punjab police, farmers allegedly forced the closure of vegetable mandi in Ferozpur and in Bathinda, farmers owing allegiance to Bhartiya Kisan Union stopped some vehicles carrying milk. Some farmers were taken into custody, said Bathinda police station officer Iqbal Singh.In Haryana, milk supply to Haryana Dairy Development Co-operative Federation Ltd was blocked in several districts.

The Mahasangh also announced it would intensify the agitation by increasing the number of traffic blockades from June 7.The decision to stop supplies starting from June 1 till June 10 was taken by the farmers under the banner of Kisan Ekta Manch and Rashtriya Kisan Maha Sangh.(With agency inputs)"

Minor incidents of scuffle between farmers and traders were also reported from Bikaner and Sriganganagar.Cooperative dairies were reluctant to procure milk because of the ongoing protest. Jaipur Dairy chairman Om Prakash Punia has written to chief secretary DB Gupta, requesting him to ensure adequate security for milk tankers.On Saturday, farmers spilled milk on roads in Jaipur rural areas.

You can have them scrambled, boiled, curried, poached, baked, basted, fried sunny side up and even whisked raw in coffee. Additionally, they play the role of binder, thickener, emulsifier and vitalizer. Want to give definition and bounce to your hair? Simply slap an egg on your scalp!As a protein source, eggs are a delight for both weight-watchers and those building muscle. But none desires eggs more than the hungry soul who is either low on budget or shorn of a wholesome eating option late at night.Shabbir Shaikh comes to the rescue here. The 39-year-old has been running a handcart selling egg dishes outside the Shivajinagar railway station for the past 20 years. He conducts business till 3am, moving his cart into a nondescript lane adjoining the station after midnight.On an average, Shaikh uses 300 eggs daily but sticks to just three dishes  bhurji, omelette and half fry (renamed palti if flipped over). Each dish, which comes with four pavs, is priced at Rs 50 till midnight and Rs 60 thereafter. Interestingly, Shaikh says rail and bus passengers are not his chief clientele  word of mouth about his food draws in regular customers from as far as Pimpri and Hinjewadi.Like Shaikh, most stalls and handcarts in the city restrict their egg menu to not more than four or five dishes. Yash Pawar, owner of Pune Egg Cafe on Senapati Bapat Road, says this is very unlike Gujarat, especially Surat and Vadodara, where stalls have around 25-30 different egg dishes on their list.The 24-year-old Pawar, who grew up in Vadodara and came here to study at Symbiosis, has more than 50 egg items on his menu, with the average pricing being Rs 100. He says his chef, who is from Vadodara, can rustle up 300 types of egg dishes. Pawar offers eggs in rice, gravies and parathas, and as starters or omelettes. His trademark dishes are the ghotala (of Surat fame), boiled egg tikka masala and egg-kheema rice. And, yes, the place satisfies late-night food cravings.Pawar says he uses only Amul butter for his dishes. So does Dnyaneshwar Narvankar, the franchise owner of the newly-started eggs-only Raju Omlet at Vimannagar. Now, the Omlet is no typo; it has been retained in the name boards of all 12 outlets of the brand  six of them in Gujarat and one each in Mumbai, Pune, Dubai, Sharjah, Pattaya and the US.All outlets have a fixed menu of 13 dishes, and each dish uses 50 gms of butter. The dishes are priced up to Rs 170, and the best-sellers are the green boiled egg tikka and the crush omelette. Narvankar says the outlets do not believe in experimenting with too many dishes, though he points out that one can find more than 1,000 egg recipes across Gujarat. The Vadodara outlet, from where the business started, uses a whopping 1,500 eggs a day.At Sangvi, Shriram Pawar operates a food truck which offers 111 egg dishes from evening to midnight. The 34-year-old, who spent a year in a similar business in Surat, claims to be the only one in Maharashtra to offer the intriguingly-named egg pomfret. Well, this dish is basically an omelette fried adequately to earn a texture like the skin of a fish. The omelette is then folded and shaped like a pomfret. It is stuffed with chopped cooked egg whites and cheese before being dunked into a plateful of tomato-based gravy.Pawar, who uses around 200 eggs per day, says each of his myriad dishes has a unique taste. An exhaustive menu like his would be found in many places in Gujarat, he points out. There, eggs have an acceptability factor among the largely vegetarian population, even though they may not be eaten at home."

About 28 traders did not participate in the first phase of the process that took place on Tuesday.Acknowledging that the reception among existing traders to relocate their business to the Kallikudi integrated market complex was overwhelming, officials said that around 272 wholesale traders would be moved to the ground floor of the new 9.79 acre facility. Subsequently, in the second phase, the department in coordination with the district administration eyes to relocate another 100 traders from the Gandhi market.We have initiated the process to allot shop numbers and respective blocks to the traders whose applications were selected based on suggestions and inspections by the scrutiny committee that includes city corporation. The response to relocate was good particularly among the English and country vegetables traders, an official with the agriculture marketing department told TOI.The allotment process saw the 272 traders allocated with a shop each across selective blocks of the total 19 blocks in the integrated market. Subsequently, the traders provided with shops through randomisation will be asked to make an agreement with the marketing department to rent the shops for one year tenure.The registration process for identified traders allotted with shops will conclude by June 15 (Friday). Simultaneously, we will take measures to hand over keys to the respective traders, the official added. The stakeholders have asserted that full-fledged relocation of 300 wholesale traders from Gandhi market to integrated market would be initiated after June 15. When the district administration insists us to relocate the shops we have no other go. Traffic woes in Gandhi market may come down to an extent post our relocation, S Jayaraman, a tomato trader allotted with a shop in new market said."

The current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops.Sugarcane farmers in Uttar Pradesh are owed over Rs 8,300 crore for the crop they have supplied to mills this crushing season at the state governments advised price (SAP). Maharashtras cane growers had similar unpaid dues of Rs 2,213 crore as on March 31, that too, against the Centres lower mandated fair and remunerative price (FRP). Yet, cane area in Maharashtra for the coming 2018-19 season from October is nearly 19 per cent up, while there are reports of UP farmers, too, planting more, undeterred by mounting payment arrears. One reason for this could be sugarcanes hardiness and ability to withstand hail, frost, fire, water, nilgai and wild boar, making it practically a default crop in areas where there is assured irrigation. The fact that its green top leaves can meet the fodder requirements of animals during the crushing period from October to April further adds to the attractiveness.But the current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops. We are, indeed, witnessing a disturbing trend now of farmers going back to planting not just cane, but also paddy and wheat. These are safe crops, where there is reasonable guarantee of receiving minimum support price (MSP) through government procurement. Sugarcane farmers, likewise, know that mills will eventually be forced to pay the FRP/SAP, though the monies may come with a few months delay. Theres no such certainty of return or even yields vis--vis other crops. Bt cotton has lost its bite, with the existing hybrids becoming increasingly susceptible to white-fly and pink bollworm attacks. Oilseeds and pulses have been trading below MSPs over the last 2-3 harvesting seasons. Farmers arent making money even in vegetable cultivation: Tomatoes in Kolar (Karnataka), onions in Lasalgaon (Maharashtra) and potatoes in Agra (UP) are currently selling or were just sold at Rs 6-7 per kg.Given these realities, it is not difficult to see why farmers are seeking a flight to safety  from chana to wheat in Madhya Pradesh, tur, soyabean and ginger to sugarcane in Marathwada, cotton and maize to paddy in Punjab. This is more akin to distress migration rather than a response to any profit signals. The policy prescription to address it is simple: The Centre and state governments should desist from hiking MSPs/FRPs/SAPs of paddy, wheat and sugarcane, which will further incentivise the cultivation of these relatively water-intensive crops. Instead, farmers should be ensured of getting MSPs and reasonable returns at least in oilseeds, pulses, tomatoes, onions and potatoes, whether through physical procurement or price deficiency payment transfers directly into their bank accounts.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

I start cooking after 10 a.m with the assistance of two persons. The gruel requires constant stirring to achieve proper consistency and we have to serve it hot. I stay back at the mosque till kanji is served, he said.Abdul Razack, 70, who leads the prayers in the mosque every day, says that it is ideal diet for people during fasting. It is cooked in a manner that it is easy to digest, he adds.The family of 56-year-old Mohammed Nasar, president of the Pallivasal, has been doing this service for 11 generations. It was his great grandfather Nanu Sahib who built this mosque in 1928. We have taken up this service for generations. During Ramzan month, people who pray at the mosque donate towards the preparation of kanji. The names of all the 30 donors are displayed in the mosque. They donate a minimum of Rs. 10,000 per day to buy 50 kg rice, vegetables and other ingredients required to prepare the kanjiHe added that tokens are issued to 300 people.

We have an archival recipe record of nearly 400-500 dishes, which we have served in our restaurant in the last 75 years, says Akash K Kalra, Managing Director, The United Group. Of these, around 150-200 dishes are on the menu all the time. We keep going back to these, bringing it back to our customers, adapting it to suit their palate and new trends, adds Kalra.Despite this emphasis on food, when United Coffee House started, food was not its focal point. It was more of a place to meet and chat  an adda of sorts. As Kalra says, For many, this was a place to walk in on Sundays after listening to the military nand play and watching the fountains at Central Park for a cup of coffee with snacks.Making the right brewEstablished in 1942, it was the brain child of Lala Hans Raj Kalra (Akash Kalras grandfather), the son of a liquor baron who had a flourishing liquor business in Sialkot in Pakistan. The family moved to Delhi and were based in Chandni Chowk.The first foray into hospitality came with the setting up of the Esplanade Restaurant & Bar in 1938-39 to cater to the American GIs who had their barracks at the Red Fort. It proved to be very popular, but since it was meant for the GIs, it wound up with their moving out after the War in the early 40s.Around that time, Hans Raj Kalra heard of an affluent shopping arcade in Lutyens Delhi called Connaught Place, which had been built in the shape of a horse shoe, for luck. What it lacked was a coffee house. He bought the place and opened United Coffee House.In the 40s, the place would be open from 11 am to 8 pm, typically selling street snacks of Old Delhi. Kalra says, Food then was commercial. No one would eat home food outside, so it was only omelette, chana bhatura, tikka...Post-Independence, the hours extended, and by the 60s it became a full-fledged restaurant. The cuisine initially was a mix of the Old Delhi Kayasth food and Frontier Province Pakistani food.The menu expanded, and during their lifetime, the place had served everything from commercial food, bibiyana (homemade) food, Madras club food, Bombay club food, Calcutta club food, Anglo Indian, khansama-cooked memsahib cuisine, to continental food, Asian, Mexican, Lebanese and, of course, Indian.Conceived in the British era, it still holds a fondness for the Old Raj cuisine, especially British club food  cheese balls, cutlets, samosas, chops.On the menuKalra says, We are known for our keema samosa, cheese balls, tomato fish and chicken a la Kiev. These have not been invented by us, but our variation is a huge hit. There are plenty of other staples  chapli kebabs, Railway mutton curry, dak bungalow chicken curry, chicken Maryland, coq au vin, chicken a la princess.Kalra explains, My grandfather had the acumen to get some of the finest cooks of those times to work for us. With their feedback and my grandfathers insight, a dish would be perfected after many trials. For example, a chef from Lucknow might add raw mango and bay leaf to a dak bungalow chicken curry, which made the taste entirely different from the usual one.To commemorate the 75th year, a new menu was unveiled in May. Classic dishes which had not been on the menu for 20-30 years were revamped.Kalra enthusiastically says, Fuyong, chow chows from Asia, buttermilk burgers were on the list. These dishes are being adjusted to suit todays palate. So if a baked salmon was served with boiled vegetables, today we would be doing it with braised bok choi.What works for UCH is that it still retains the old-world charm of the 1950s  the laid-back era of fine dining, huge chandeliers, unhurried knowledgeable waiters, the attention and care to the patrons with a sense of discreet familiarity."

The states where the farmers have started the stir include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, and those in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and other states may join them. The plan also includes a nationwide bandh on June 10. Farmers have resorted to protest actions like stopping the supply of produce to the mandis and it has started impacting the prices of vegetables, fruits and milk in cities and towns. The agitation is being organised by as many as 104 farmers bodies, led by the Rashtriya Kisan Sangh. It is unfortunate that farmers have to be in a perpetual mode of agitation, and it shows that their problems continue to remain unsolved. Farmers in Maharashtra made a long march to Mumbai in March. The Maharashtra government accepted their demands but the promises are yet to be implemented.The farmers have made a number of demands, including remunerative prices for their produce and waiver of farm loans. The agitation is mainly against the central government. The Narendra Modi government had promised to raise the minimum support prices to 150% of the cost of production, as recommended by the Swaminathan Committee, but it has not done that. It had promised to double farmers income by 2022, but most farmers are poorer now than they there a few years ago. Indebted farmers continue to commit suicide. The present plight in many places is not because of the failure of crops resulting from drought or other reasons but because of higher production and the consequent fall in prices. For example, the production of potatoes, tomatoes and garlic has increased but this has led to their prices falling below cost. Marketing of produce is a major problem because of the existence of intermediaries, and the farmer never gets the right price. Official policies often work against the interests of farmers. The government has decided to import sugar and tur dal when there is a glut of these in the country.The lack of facilities for preservation of perishable produce like fruits and vegetables and the absence of an efficient and transparent marketing mechanism are major problems. There is no system to give guidance to farmers on the crops to be cultivated on the basis of projections of demand and supply. Uncertainties caused by weather and government policies continue and the farm insurance system is very inadequate. The spreading agitation is another wake-up call and warning to the government. Effective policies and actions, and not promises and slogans, are needed to mitigate the rising distress."

Along the 856km border between them, much of which is fenced, Indian families live outside the barrier, connected with gates manned by the BSF.On Sunday, when Assembly elections will be held in Tripura, these residents will come out of their caged existence to vote. At Jainagar here, 39 Muslim families had their homes on the wrong side when the fence came up nearly 12 years ago. Since then, their movements are restricted by the clock - the gates open at 6am and close at 8.30pm.Along the border, these gates are numbered. At Gate 86, young Sofikul seeks the BSF sentry's permission to come out with his bicycle and head to school.

The BSF sentries deposit the keys at the camp and the procedure to reopen the gates in an emergency involves securing permission from the authorities, the BSF company commander at Konaban in Sipahijala district, Pawan Yadav explains.Having travelled 60km along the fencing, with a lone sentry at each gate, one reaches the Kamalasagar company headquarters of the force. The security on this smuggling-prone stretch is double-layered: area domination patrols by day and ambush-cum-patrol teams at night. At Radhanagar, Abul Kasam Mia, Joydeep Debnath and Dhirendra Debnath stand at the CPM rally kiosk. The sitting MLA looks set to retain his seat here.On reaching Belabor (Gate 92), we find villagers Abdul Majid and Sajal Mia emerging from the gates. Theirs is a piquant situation: their homes are on the Indian side of the gate, but the farmland lies on the other side, so they make multiple entries during the day. At Gate 98 at Motinagar, 400 people live inside the fence. On Sunday, these voters will troop out and head for the nearest booth.

(Image used for representational purpose)A little over a month since the Union Budget declared a special Operation Green for tomato, onion and potato growers, prices of at least the first two produces seem to be touching an all-time low in the state. With wholesale prices of both the commodities going down to single digits, most farmers are staring at major agrarian distress. In Maharashtra, the wholesale markets of Junnar in Pune and Pimpalgaon in Nashik are major hubs of tomato trade.On Friday, the Pimpalgaons market had recorded the arrival of 695 crates of tomatoes, and the average traded price per crate was Rs 61. With a crate containing 20 kg of tomato, the average price per kg works out to be Rs 3 at the wholesale markets. Similarly, at the Narayangaon wholesale market, 6,330 crates of the produce had arrived, and the average traded price of a crate was Rs 60, which also translates to Rs 3 per kg. Junnar is normally the hub of summer tomatoes, while Pimpalgaon mostly gets the the winter crop.Onions, which till recently, were trading above the Rs 20 per kg mark, has also started trading below the Rs 10 per kg at most wholesale markets. At Lasalgaons wholesale market in Nashiks Niphad taluka, the average traded price of onion was Rs 7.54 per kg, with the market recording the arrival of 15,140 quintals of the bulb. Just about a month ago, onions were trading at Rs 15.50 per kg at this market, a steady fall of over 50 per cent.Maharashtra has seen a 10-15 per cent rise in area under cultivation for both onions and tomatoes. Shriram Ghadhave, president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India (VGAI), attributed this growth to the good rainfall received in the state last year. As against the 2.5 lakh hectares of tomato area, this year, we have about 3 lakh hectares under the crop. Even places like Beed, Aurangabad and Parbhani, which normally do not see cultivation of summer tomatoes, have planted the crop, he said.A similar situation has resulted in the steep price fall in case of onions also. Ghadhave added that inter-state trade has almost stopped with traders from north India absent from the market.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

A la carte. Im talking about the 40s, 50s and 60s, when Bombays food culture was blooming.This is before anyone could conceive that surnames like Lokhandwala and Hiranandani would mutate into names of suburbs. It was a time when restaurants along the Churchgate strip, hotels like The Taj Mahal and virtuosos like Chef Masci (Miguel Arcanjo Mascarenhas) were introducing the Bombay elite to words like Velout, Bchamel, Au Gratin and Flamb. The city was warming up to what was generically called Continental food.Lets stop there for a moment and examine that term. The Continent is Europe and the influence is from France and Italy and maybe the odd dish from Hungary and Russia. The cuisines of these countries slowly swaying the humdrum, morose tastes of Great British Cooking. And that food making its way to our metropolitan aspirations.Me with my lobster thermidor. This marriage of creamy seafood/ meat, egg and wine are hallmarks of the cuisine that ruled Bombay menus from the 40s through the 60s.Now cooks and butlers in Calcutta, Madras and Bombays posh clubs, and households too, were turning into desi Escoffiers, all expertly mastering Continental dishes. Innovative and complicated recipes like Chicken a la Kiev (a little hand-grenade sized ball of crumb fried hollow chicken served with buttered beans, carrots and mashed potato), or Chicken and Ham Timbale (minced chicken and ham, steam-baked in cups and served with mushroom sauce) or Welsh Rarebit (which is nothing but a sauce of melted cheese with red chilli, poured over slices of toasted bread) or Ramekins of Eggs (eggs baked in cheese sauce) or a Shepherds Pie (mince baked with mashed potatoes) became commonplace in the not-so-commonplace eateries.For the next 35 years or so, this cuisine reigned supreme at every banquet, buffet and blowout. No party or dinner was complete without dishes like Eggs Florentine, Vegetable Au Gratin, Poulet  la Crme et Champignons (chicken with cream and mushrooms) or Steak Chateaubriand (thick tenderloin in a shallot and red-wine reduction with chateau potatoes), always served for two.But just when you think youve learned the way to live, life changes. The 21st century brought along with it liquid nitrogen, lecithin and foams and nearly wiped out words like Espagnole, Hollandaise and Roux. Continental food got sidelined. Now considered an unhealthy, butter- and flour-laden cuisine, the world woke up to Paul Bocuse, Pierre Gagnaire, Heston Blumenthal and MasterChef on television.Just a few restaurants in Bombay still keep the richness and simplicity of Continental cuisine alive, like The Society at Ambassador Hotel with their Chicken Diane, among other dishes.Distance brings nostalgia, and with nostalgia comes perspective, and maybe objectivity. Just a few restaurants still keep the richness and simplicity of that cuisine alive. I head to Gallops at the race course for a Chicken Cecelia (sauted in butter and topped with cheese, mushroom and asparagus), and to The Society at Ambassador Hotel, which is still famous for their Roast Duck in Orange Sauce, Coq au Vin  and for that fact that the server comes to the table to flamb you a Chicken Diane or Spaghetti a la Fernandes.But my discovery of the year has been the nostalgic menu at Fenix at The Oberoi. Executive chef Satbir Bakshi has turned this modern, unassuming caf into one of the finest gourmet destinations in the city. I went there to celebrate my birthday with friends, and we started with classic Lobster Bisque. This is a wholesome crustacean soup (in this case, crayfish) thick, creamy and well-seasoned, with a base of tomato. If youre not careful, the soup could get too fishy, but this was just perfectly flavoured. Along with the bisque we ordered some good old-fashioned Prawn Cocktail. Thats cooked prawns in a cocktail sauce (essentially ketchup plus mayonnaise with a few shakes of Tabasco). At Fenix, Chef Satbir garnishes the Prawn Cocktail with thin slices of boiled egg and tops it all with caviar.At Fenix at The Oberoi, executive chef Satbir Bakshi garnishes the Prawn Cocktail with thin slices of boiled egg and tops it all with caviar.For the main course we shared Fish  la Meunire. A Meunire sauce, made from butter, lemon, and parsley, served with crispy sauted fish.But all eyes were on the Lobster Thermidor. Its a dish that has fascinated me since I was a child. So much so that I learnt to cook it when I was very young. Legend and Wiki say that the great French chef Auguste Escoffier created this dish in a Parisian restaurant called Maison Maire, near the Thtre de la Porte-Saint-Martin. The dish was named after a play, Thermidor by Victorien Sardou, which opened in that theatre to packed houses. Its whole lobster shell, stuffed with a creamy mixture of cooked lobster meat, egg yolk and cognac or white wine, gratinated with Gruyre and baked till brown. Its luxury from another day, and Fenix does it impeccably."

(Illustration: C R Sasikumar, Sarfaraz Alam) As two of the seven years have already passed and given the performance of agriculture in 2016-17 and 2017-18, the required CAGR in the remaining five years will have to be much higher than these rates. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar, Sarfaraz Alam)Prime Minister Narendra Modi is one of the best orators in Indian politics today. He is not only coherent and inspiring but connects with his audience well. He is ambitious and committed to fast-track the economy. He sets high targets and drives government machinery to achieve them. In the process, he raises aspirations and expectations of people which if not met, run the risk of hurting his own and the governments credibility.Unrealistic promises that remain unfulfilled could hurt the PMs political capital. People could doubt his intent, his understanding of involved challenges, or the capability of his government to deliver. The case in point is his often-repeated ambition of doubling farmers real incomes by 2022. By all means, we want to see him succeed in his ambition. However, our analysis and professional acumen informs us otherwise. We believe that farmers real incomes cannot be doubled even by 2025. The target of achieving it by 2030 seems more plausible. In saying so, we run the risk of being unpopular but as Gandhiji once said, Its easy to stand with the crowd. It takes courage to stand alone. And so, we gather courage to say that the ambition of doubling farmers income by 2022 is a pipe-dream and not a serious target.PM Modi spoke of his dream of doubling farmers income by 2022 for the first time in February 2016. This was repeated in successive budget speeches of the finance minister. In Ap06ril 2016, the Dalwai Committee was formed; it came out with a 14-volume report to identify ways to double farmers income from the 2015-2016 levels, in real terms, in seven years. Since there was no updated estimate of actual level of farmers incomes in 2015-16, the Committee arrived at estimates by applying net state domestic product (NSDP) growth rates on estimated state-wise farmers incomes of 2012-13 (from the NSSO). It found that an average Indian farmer household earned Rs 96,703 in 2015-16 (this was Rs 77,977 in 2012-13 according to the NSSO). Doubling this to Rs1,93,406 (at 2015-16 prices) by 2022-23, needed real incomes to grow at CAGR of 10.4 per cent at the all India-level, and at differentiated rates at state-level. Graph-1 compares the actually achieved growth rates in farmers real incomes (NSSO 2002-03 to 2012-13) with growth rates required (2015-16 to 2022-23) to double farmers income.States like Bihar where real incomes of farmers was at (-)1 per cent (CAGR) between 2002-03 and 2012-13 would require a CAGR of 12.3 per cent between 2015-16 and 2022-23 to achieve the governments target. This sounds very unlikely. There are similar unrealistic expectations from other moderate-performing agricultural states like West Bengal, UP and Jharkhand.As two of the seven years have already passed and given the performance of agriculture in 2016-17 and 2017-18, the required CAGR in the remaining five years will have to be much higher than these rates. For example, instead of 10.4 per cent, the average incomes of farmers should grow at 13 per cent nationally if the goal is to be achieved. To achieve this, the Committee estimates that about Rs 6.4 lakh crore (at 2011-12 prices) is needed by the country as additional investment. Eighty per cent of this must come from the government. Interestingly, the committee does not mention how the government intends to mobilise this amount.On February 19-20, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare organised a conference, Agriculture2022-Doubling Farmers Income. About 300 stakeholders argued their case. The PM shared his aim to overhaul the agriculture sector and double farmers incomes through a four-pronged strategy. This involves reducing costs of cultivation (through neem-coating urea and soil health cards); ensuring better prices for produce (through new cost plus-pricing MSP formula, reforming agri-markets through e-NAM and upgrading 22,000 village-markets); reducing wastage in the value-chain (through proper storage, logistics, food processing, and implementing Operation Greens-TOP (tomatoes, onions and potatoes); and diversifying sources of farmer incomes (through blue, organic, sweet revolution).Overall, there were no dearth of recommendations. But how many of these will be accepted and implemented, and by when will they deliver, is anybodys guess.We may differ with the PM on the number of years needed to fulfill his dream, but we are with him in his drive to double farmers income. For the journey ahead, we have three suggestions/questions for him. First, can he dump the inherent consumer-bias in countrys marketing and trade policies? Massive and growing food subsidies (marred with high inefficiencies) is an example of such a bias. He needs to revisit the archaic ECA, revitalise inefficient APMCs, put an end to ad hoc export bans and ensure a stable policy-environment for domestic agri-trade and exports to flourish. Second, how does he plan to absorb the production boom that will result from implementation of various recommendations? Will consumption keep pace with production? Will the solution be in processing, exports or in augmenting demand? Third, can he dump the subsidy model and embrace an investment model? Of the total resources (Rs 3.66 lakh crores) going to agriculture (and food) (see Graph-2), can he restrict subsidies on food, MNREGA, and farm inputs to less than 25 per cent and increase share of investments in/for agriculture to 75 per cent? Unless the PM makes these bold and rational policy decisions, chances of augmenting farmer incomes are bleak, let alone doubling them by 2022-23.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Operation Greens wants to replicate that success story in fruit and vegetables, starting with tomatoes, onions and potatoes.The main objective of this project, according to the finance ministry, is to reduce price volatility in these commodities, thereby helping farmers augment incomes on a sustainable basis. It also aims to provide these vegetables to consumers at affordable prices. The litmus test of this scheme would be in containing the booms and busts in prices. It will need to avert situations where farmers have been forced to dump potatoes and tomatoes on roads. Also, checking the prices from going through the roof has compelled the government to ban exports. It has resorted to de-stocking and conducted income tax raids on traders  the raids on onion traders in September last year is a case in point.India is the second largest producer of vegetables in the world with about 180 MMT. But China produces four times more vegetables than India. The accompanying graph shows a structural break in Indias vegetable production around 2003-2004. Although not as revolutionary as the Green Revolution in wheat, or the White Revolution in milk, yields of potatoes, onions and tomatoes  which constitute almost half of the countrys vegetable production  have shown a healthy growth. For example, between 2003-2004 and 2017-2018, potato production increased from 28 MMT to 49 MMT while onion yields went up from 6.3 MMT to 21 MMT and tomato production increased from 8.1 MMT to 22 MMT.However, the problem with these commodities is that their prices collapse when their production rises sharply. This is because the country lacks modern storage facilities and the links between processing and organised retailing are very weak. As a result, farmers often end up receiving less than a fourth of what consumers pay in major cities. This must change. Operation Greens needs to ensure that farmers receive at least 60 per cent of what consumers pay. In the case of milk, the producers get more than 75 per cent of what consumers pay. The basic principles of Operation Flood would be useful to operationalise Operation Greens as well.What are these principles? First, link major consumption centres to major production centres with a minimal number of intermediaries. As Verghese Kurien wrote in his book, I too had a Dream, organising farmers and increasing production is an easier job. The real challenge is to find the right markets that can give them remunerative prices on a sustainable basis. So, one needs to map mega consuming centres and link their retail networks with the producing centres of each commodity. Farmers can be organised in farmer producer organisations (FPOs). NABARD and SFAC (Small farmers agribusiness consortium) together have about 3,000 FPOs, which could be the starting points for the aggregation of commodities, assaying, sorting, grading, and even packing with bar codes, reflecting their traceability.The Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act will have to be changed to allow direct buying from FPOs, and giving incentives to these organisations, private companies and NGOs to build back end infrastructure as was done in the case of milk. The announcement of tax concessions to FPOs for five years is a welcome step in that direction, if it encourages building such critical infrastructure.Second is the investment in logistics, starting with modern warehouses, that can minimise wastage. An example is of cold storage for onions, where wastage is reduced to less than 10 per cent, compared to the 25-30 per cent wastage in traditional storage facilities on farmers fields. Such storage facilities have to be cost effective. A potato cold storage in UP, for example, that buys power at almost Rs 10/kwh from SEBs, can become efficient by generating solar power at less than Rs 4/kwh. Large-scale investments in storage will require tweaking of the Essential Commodities Act.Third is linking the processing industry with organised retailing. On an average, about one-fourth of the produce must be processed. India is way behind on this curve compared to most Southeast Asian countries. Dehydrated onions, tomato puree and potato chips should become cheap, so that an average household can use them. Processing industry adds value and absorbs surpluses. Seen this way, the finance ministers announcement of increasing the allocation for the food processing industry by 100 per cent is a welcome step. The food processing ministry will have to coordinate with Operation Greens.By developing such forward and backward linkages, the government can ease large price fluctuations, raise farmers share in the price paid by the consumer and at the same time, ensure lower prices for the consumers  a win-win situation for all.However, Operation Greens would need a champion to implement this vision and strategy with honesty, another Kurien, for at least three to five years. A babu will not work. Can the government locate another Kurien?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

In Anna Karenina, only if a person is satisfied on all counts will she be happy. The allocations in the budget cover every sector, with umpteen implications, and no persons expectations can be fulfilled on all counts. While every expectation cant be met, it must be acknowledged that Finance Minister (FM) Arun Jaitley has presented a budget which focuses on rural India and is a great leap forward for the policy-battered farm sector. According to Article 112 of the Constitution, the Union Budget is simply a statement of the estimated receipts and expenditures of the government for a particular year.Rather than the budget being an annual jamboree for announcing policies, the prime minister should address the nation with his ideas for the coming year, based on which the FM should subsequently present the budget. The first step towards atonement and for penance is to acknowledge past failure. As the Economic Survey rightly states, real incomes of farmers have been stagnant. The next step is to take corrective measures and redeem the situation. An effort has been initiated in that direction in this budget.Assurance of purchase of all crops for which MSP is declared is a positive step. If the governments promise is of A2+50 per cent profit, then it is half-baked. It should have simultaneously announced acceptance of the Ramesh Chand Committees recommendations on the calculation of MSP, which it has not. The Niti Aayog is finally evolving into the credible policy think-tank we had been hoping for. It is also supposed to come out with a suitable mechanism to enable institutional credit access to lessee farmers.The Agri-Market Infrastructure Fund, with a corpus of Rs 2,000 crore, is to be set up for developing and upgrading agricultural marketing infrastructure in the 22,000 Gramin Agricultural Markets and 585 Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs). This will enable farmers in remote locations who are devoid of any institutional mechanism to connect to markets. Operation Green on the lines of Operation Flood to tackle the volatility of tomato, onion and potato prices is a positive development. The long-standing demand of income tax exemption for farmer producer organisations has been fulfilled. A Rs 10,000 crore fund to finance the infrastructure requirements of fisheries, aquaculture and animal husbandry will generate rural employment and supplement farmer incomes.The intent to mitigate the air pollution woes of Delhi-NCR by subsidising the machinery required for in-situ management of crop residue has now been addressed. Targeted programmes like those under the Prime Minister Krishi Sinchai Yojna for 96 irrigation-deprived districts, where less than 30 per cent of the land holdings get assured irrigation, is the way forward. The focus on horticulture clusters and converting cattle dung and solid waste in farms to compost, fertiliser, biogas and bio-CNG is also commendable.Read | Budget 2018 explained: Arun Jaitleys budget has no creative incrementalism on showThe flagship National Health Protection Scheme to cover over 50 crore poor and vulnerable beneficiaries providing coverage upto Rs 5 lakh per family per year for hospitalisation is outstanding. But the fund allocation for the programme is insignificant. I wonder if it will suffer the fate of many of last years budget announcements which have not materialised due to lack of allocations. In Davos, there was a general scepticism regarding the data presented to project the Indian growth story. A similar apprehension persists regarding the fund allocations in this budget.Climate change worries have not been addressed as agriculture R&D has been ignored. Nor is there a mention of the balanced use of fertilisers. The magic-bullet demand for changing the Centre-state funding ratio from 60:40 to 90:10 for agriculture-related schemes has unfortunately been overlooked.A constant red thread running uniformly through the budgets of the past 10 years, presented by three finance ministers of India, is that farmer suicides have not abated. In the last three years, over 36,000 farmers have committed suicide.Power is the capacity to change the lives of people. The prime minister must direct his immense power to bring the sorry saga of farmer suicides to an end. Budget allocations serve as the perfect instrument to change the narrative of resentment to one of hope. He must quickly solve farmers crises or heed the warning, given in different circumstances, by Benjamin Franklin: We must all hang together or most assuredly we will all hang separately.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Price of sambar onion has fallen from Rs 160/kg to Rs 35/kg since November, while the price of tomato reduced from Rs 20/kg to Rs 8/kg. Traders at the market said that the fall in price will persist for three more weeks till the second crop of the year comes along.Koyambedu vegetables, fruits and flowers traders welfare association president M Thyagarajan , who is a tomato trader, said, Usually, we receive 400-450 loads of vegetables daily. But now we are getting nearly 550 loads. Yield from the first crop of the year (December  January) is usually the highest due to cold weather and availability of excess water. Price of vegetables is set to gradually rise with the arrival of the second crop from February 20.Water-rich vegetables like turnip (nookal), radish (mullangi), chayote (chow chow), beetroot, okra (vendakkai), snake gourd (pudalangai) and white pumpkin (poosanikkai) are now priced at Rs 5- Rs 10. Koyambedu vegetables, fruits and flowers traders welfare association treasurer P G M Sukumar said, Foreign (non-indigenous) vegetables like cabbage, carrot, and capsicum require a greater amount of water to grow as compared to the local varieties. Price of these vegetables has fallen thanks to an excess rainfall.According to traders, the first crop yield is 100kg per acre while second crop (February-March) yield is only 50kg/acre. The wholesale price of vegetables like nookal and mullangi was Rs 5, while their retail price was Rs 10 on Monday.The price of tomato fell gradually since November 2017. Sukumar said, In November, the price of tomato was Rs 20/kg. It fell to Rs 15 in early December and by the end of the month, it was Rs 10. Now the price is Rs 8. Only the price of drumstick (Rs 50- Rs 60/kg) has remained stable since November 2017."

(Archive) With assembly elections in 10 states due later this year, the states going to the polls are making attempts to woo farmers. (Archive)Farm distress is likely to be one of the major focal points of the upcoming Union Budget. Agri-GDP growth has fallen to around 2 per cent per annum in the first four years of the Modi government; the real incomes of farmers have fallen as well. The growth in the agriculture sector is much below the Centres target and the government does not seem to be on course to double farmers incomes by 2022. With assembly elections in 10 states due later this year, the states going to the polls are making attempts to woo farmers. While some have announced loan waivers, others are trying to fix farmers woes emanating from tumbling farm prices. Here, we focus on two pilot projects to see if they can be scaled-up at the all India level.The first is the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (BBY), essentially a price deficiency payment (PDP) scheme, being undertaken by the government of Madhya Pradesh. BBY applies to eight kharif crops  soybean, maize, urad, tur, moong, groundnut, til, ramtil. The Haryana government has announced a somewhat similar scheme for four vegetables  potatoes, onions, tomatoes and cauliflower. The second pilot scheme we talk about is underway in Telangana, where the government gives all farmers an investment support for their working capital needs.Under the BBY, farmers have to first register on a portal. Their sown area is verified by government officials. They are then asked to bring their produce to mandis at a time fixed by the state government. Based on average productivity of a crop in the district and area cultivated by the farmer, the quantity of each produce that is eligible for deficiency payment is also determined by the government. Farmers receive the difference between average sale price (ASP) and MSP directly into their bank accounts. The scheme seems interesting as it provides an alternative to physical procurement of commodities at minimum support prices (MSPs). The ASP is calculated as the simple average of the weighted modal prices of the relevant crops in the regulated mandis of Madhya Pradesh and two adjoining states. The price information is drawn from the Centres agmarknet.gov.in portal.For kharif 2017-18, so far, data related to five crops (soybean, maize, groundnut, urad and moong) has been finalised for price deficiency payment. The market prices of til and ramtil are higher than the MSP and therefore they do not qualify for price deficiency payment. The tur season will start from February.The graph shows the key results of BBY for October-December, 2017. It is interesting to note that only 32 per cent of urad production in Madhya Pradesh got the yojanas benefit despite the fact that ASP of urad was 42 per cent below its MSP. In other words, 68 per cent of urad production was sold at prices below MSP, without any compensation under BBY. In the case of soybean, the states prime kharif crop, the percentage of production benefiting from this scheme is even lower  only 18.5 per cent, despite its ASP being 12 per cent below the MSP. And for maize, groundnut and moong, the coverage is even poorer (see graph).Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana: Who gained and how much? Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana: Who gained and how much?The Madhya Pradesh government claims to have paid about Rs 1,900 crore as compensation to farmers for these five crops. But that pertains to only those farmers registered on its portal. A larger proportion of farmers are not registered on the portal and they have been selling their produce at huge losses. These farmers have not received any compensation. In fact, those not registered under BBY have to suffer bigger losses because traders are suppressing the market. We have calculated their loss by multiplying the production not covered under BBY with the price difference between MSP and ASP. The actual prices in Madhya Pradesh are even lower than the ASP, which is the average of modal prices of three states. The total loss for these five crops comes to Rs 6,534 crore. So, if the scheme was fully successful and covered entire production, the Madhya Pradesh governments revenue outgo would be Rs 8,434 crore, and not Rs 1,900 crore. This would be more than 90 per cent of the states total budget for agriculture. In sum, BBY is not inclusive, covers less than 25 per cent of the farmers loss, involves too much micro-management by government officials and is prone to market manipulation.Haryanas scheme for four vegetables is even worse as the presumed MSP (Rs 400 per quintal for potatoes and tomatoes and Rs 500 per quintal for onions and cauliflower) does not even cover the full cost of production as estimated by the Union Ministry of Agriculture and the National Horticulture Board for these crops.In contrast to these programmes is the government of Telanganas input support scheme. Announced in the second week of January, the schemes objective is to relieve farmers from taking loans from moneylenders by giving them Rs 4,000 per acre for the kharif and rabi seasons. It is envisaged that the farmer will use this money for purchase of inputs ranging from seeds to fertilisers to machinery and hired labour. The area eligible for investment support is 14.21 million acre  the governments annual bill for the project, thus, comes to around Rs 5,685 crore.The Telangana model does not require the farmer to register his cultivated area and crops. The farmer is free to grow a crop of his choice and sell it anytime in a mandi of his choice. This model is crop-neutral, more equitable, more transparent, and gives farmers the freedom to choose. Incidentally, China has a similar scheme: It gives aggregate input subsidy support on a per acre basis. The scheme does not distort markets and is worth following.

The students of this school have identity cards like their private school counterparts, thanks to Elamurugan who spent from his pocket and collected money from alumni to provide this. For two years he has been providing snacks and tiffin, with the help of sponsors, to students who are preparing for SSLC and Plus Two examinations.The school, started in 1962, now has 903 students from classes VI to XII. ""Twenty-five years ago, I was working in a private school which had a lot of facilities for students.

After I became the headmaster of the school, I decided to do something for the students with the help of fellow teachers,"" said Elamurugan.""We issued identity cards for all students and teachers. We selected a group of students and made them members of the students protection committee. The group had to ensure that all students kept their nails and hair neatly trimmed. The names of those who do not maintain this are sent to the physical education teacher. If the students do not maintain discipline, their parents will be approached,"" said Elamurugan.The school also started a career guidance centre where students were prepared for competitive exams. ""The students live in villages and do not have much awareness about competitive exams. To promote savings and to create awareness about banking services, we opened bank accounts for 450 students and requested them to save money,"" he said.The school also has a counselling centre for students to beat stress. ""The parents of the many students are daily wage labourers and sometimes their family problems affect the children. So we give free counselling to the students and invite their parents to talk about their problems. In one case, a couple reunited for the sake of their sons future,"" said Elamurugan.He said a herbal garden on the school premises was maintained by a team of students. Another garden too is maintained by a team of students. Tomatos, chillies, and spinach are cultivated on the premises and these are used for the noon meal scheme.""We have two smart class rooms for students of Classes VI to XII.

As we live in Seattle, Washington, and as she misses the festivities of our country, wherever there is any festival of India, we have food art at home. I narrate her stories related to our country while feeding her.

She too decided to go creative on the dining table by way of a solution. Come Republic Day and Independence Day, it is tricolour that is dished out. I keep on experimenting with different cuisines. I believe it is the best way to teach them about their nation and the spirit of Republic Day. And my narration of stories via food begin a week before. As they love sweets, I made tricolour vanilla sponge cake and cupcakes and will follow them up with puddings and pedas, she says.It seems to be a trend for NRIs to celebrate Republic Day with flavoured ideas.

Food plays an important role in such get-togethers. People often enjoy preparing food with the theme of tricolour, she says. For green sauce she has used spinach and the ingredients of white sauce is refined flour, milk and butter and the red Sauce base is of tomato.Tarun Alex from Ranni who is passionate about cooking is on a vacation at Dubai and is planning a South Indian breakfast for his friends, the speciality being tricolour idlis.

This young bio-technologist decided to make use of her degree and knowledge to make a change in the environment for the better.What started as a hobby, soon turned into a profession says Mansi, Due to my mother who has a green thumb even when we were kids we were always inclined towards growing plants and had a mini garden in the balcony. The love for greenery grew and with the help of my dad who has a printing press I decided to incorporate seeds in plain paper which can then grow into plants.Along with paper for gift wrapping, writing, note pads, invites, etc., Mansi also made mud modaks during the Ganapati festival and mud rangoli tiles during Diwali , all infused with paper seeds. And that is how the flags infused with paper seeds too was an idea that she thought of. We were already on a spree to make sure our festivals are green with green modaks and rangolis when I came up with the idea last year in January just before Republic Day. I started thinking about making such a product when I saw a lot of paper flags being made and sold at signals. What upset me though is that we see these same flags being dumped into the trash later that day or the next day. I realised that we as Indians claim to be patriotic in the way of listening to patriotic songs, hoisting our flag, etc., but we dont give a second thought to what happens to those flags post Republic or Independence Day. I realised I can initiate and make some change, so why not. We produced approximately 1000 seed paper flags about a week before Republic Day with the message Dont throw, grow me printed on the back. The idea is to encourage people to grow these flags into plants as opposed to just throwing them out. We made sure its fine to plant a flag and followed the Indian Flag code.The flags are made of handmade paper infused with seeds and the screen print uses vegetable inks. Talking about the seeds that go into the flag, Mansi says, We infuse the paper with a variety of seeds ranging from chilli and marigold to basil, tomato and tulsi. With the flags, in particular, we dont use different seeds for different colours but with other products this can be customised based on the requirement.Mansi remembers how initially when they distributed the flags in a housing society the enthusiasm of the children was infectious, They all made sure their parents, grandparents and friends all planted their flags and that no one threw them out. I have a very special memory of interacting with some children who had no idea what to do with the regular flags once they were done wearing them. On finding out that they could plant our flags they jumped up with excitement and started to enquire how they should plant it, what plant would emerge etc. Seeing their happy, excited reactions was thrilling and I knew that Im on the right path.The interest is ever growing and as compared to last year when Mansi started making paper seed flags to this year the response has been encouraging. Says Mansi, We, are now happy that this Republic Day there are many more flags out there which will grow into little plants and in their little way help preserve nature. And we all must know and realise the fact that there is no Planet B."

The experiment has yielded very good results and last year 500 households produced 48,000kg of the produce.The trust is calling this initiative nutrition farming and is insisting that none of these produces be sold in the market. We want every child in the family to have access to the balanced diet from their own produce. We discourage people to sell their produce and ask them to consume it within the family to fight malnutrition. We have been carrying out this experiment for last few years. Last year, there was a record produce of 48,000kg from 500 families, said Dr Satav.Earlier, the tribals grew only rice. Now they are growing jowar, soyabean, all major vegetables like ladys finger, carrot, radish, methi, palak, tomato, chilli, 5-8 types of different protein rich beans and peanuts.The Trust has taught them scientific selection of crops which include cereals, pulses, vegetables, vegetables rich in vitamins and minerals and oilseeds.A model farm was set up in the Trusts premises  an acres area housing hospital and residences of doctors and staff  at Karamagram in Utavali village. The integrating farming included crops like gram, rajgira, five types of beans, turmeric, chilli, tapioca, sweet potato, linseed fruits like papaya, amla, banana, chikoo and goti tea grass.Being a rain-fed area, Melghat gets no water from irrigation projects. So, tribals use the entire waste water from kitchen and houses for maintaining the garden. The patients visiting the hospital saw the farm and adopted the model gradually, said Dr Satav.Dr Satav says that there is a visible change in the health of tribals, especially children. He said the Trust will be monitoring the changes with scientific parameters, comparing them with population which does not have access to balanced diet on large-scale, and publish the results.Though we have been using the intervention model which uses ready-to-eat therapeutic foods for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and severe underweight (SUW) and that too has yielded very good results, in the long run cultivating the required food and consuming it is the only solution to malnutrition, said Dr Satav.The malnutrition rate in the 17 villages under various projects of Mahan Trust has gone down by 50%. Though the SAM rate in Melghat is about 7-8%, this figure in the project area under Mahan has reduced to just 1%. Similarly, the SUW rate in Melghat is 14-15% while it is 10% in the 17 intervention villages."

Those who braved the early morning chill to head to the Koyambedu wholesale market on Friday, part from of course retail merchants, came away with bagas of vegetables, most of them for a scarcely believable Rs 10 per kg and below.With truckloads of vegetables flooding the market, the cost of vegetables has crashed. Chandran , president of Koyambedu Market Licensed Merchants Association said brinjal, beans, cabbage, ladies finger (okra), broad beans and tomato sold for less than Rs 10 per kilogram.The arrival of trucks with these vegetables has increased by 25% from the average 100 to 125 vehicles. So, this has reflected in a significant drop , he said.While one kilogram of onion cost anything between Rs 30/kg and Rs 40/kg, potato and yam sold for Rs 15/kg to Rs 20/kg and Rs 20/kg to Rs 25/kg.The wholesale market received 450 trucks of vegetables and about 50 vehicles more to meet the demand for Pongal from different parts of Tamil Nadu , Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka The situation in the retail markets, however, was different, with residents in many areas saying prices were much higher.Responding to this, Chandran said retail traders would factor in a minimum a profit margin of Rs 10 for every kilogram of vegetables to meet the expenses incurred in transporting the goods to respective places."

Maintained jointly by teachers and students from classes VI to VIII, without affecting their classroom sessions, around 50-60 kg of vegetables of nine plant varieties are harvested at the school every week and supplied to the school kitchen for the noon meal scheme.The school has classes for standards I to VIII and a student strength of 140, of which classes up to standard IV are taught both English and in Tamil medium. Vegetable cultivation being done on about 0.25 acres within the school campus.Started in September 2016 with the personal interest of 42-year-old teacher S Elavalagan and subsequent cooperation from fellow staff, the green project expanded the acreage of horticulture crops from just 5 cents to 0.25 acres. Teachers along with the students would engage in vegetable plantation and also in maintaining existing plants. It is the self-interest of 57 students studying from classes VI to VIII that allowed the acreage of horticulture crops to expand. Parents are also supportive in the move as they willingly send their wards to school even on Sundays, S Elavalagan told TOI.With seeds obtained at free of cost from Indian Institute of Horticulture Research, Bengaluru, through good Samaritans , the school has planted about 18 vegetable varieties of which nine varieties render substantial yield on daily and weekly basis.Belonging to the small onion belt of Tamil Nadu , the school last week cultivated small onions within their campus and new vegetable breeds such as carrots, beetroot, cauliflower and cabbage. For the last one year we have been cultivating and harvesting tomato, ladies finger, bitter gourd, snake gourd and broad beans. Most of the yield will go to the school kitchen for preparing noon meals for the children and the surplus, on rotational basis, would be provided free of cost to the families of students who actively maintain the crops, Elavalagan added.The school with as many as seven teachers including the headmaster perhaps could have made revenue by selling the surplus vegetables to the shops, but instead preferred to plant green thoughts among students by giving harvested vegetables to students as a pat on their backs.M Guru, a class VII student, said that the green activity in school has motivated him to pursue farming in future and said that his parents were happy about their ward spending quality time in farming. My father migrated from agriculture even though my grandfather was a farmer. Completing my studies, I will certainly take up farming since it has become my passion, said Guru, spotted watering the vegetable plants on the school campus on Sunday.Another student of the school, R Kalaiselvan said that he feels relaxed while watering the plants rather than playing cricket with his friends. On an average, each week, at least 5-10 children are taking home surplus vegetable for which feedback from their houses is positive as the vegetables are grown organically."

Anil Kumar and senior functionaries of CFTRI to work out action plans to address the issue.Das was accompanied by chief secretary Sudhir Tripathi, additional chief secretary (finance) Sukhdev Singh, rural development principal secretary Avinash Kumar, industry secretary Sunil Kumar Barnwal, social welfare secretary Vinay Kumar Choube and state's nutrition mission director general D.K. Saxena.After detailed deliberations, the chief minister asked the DFRL representatives to provide equipment and training to the sakhi mandals.Initially, 12 food processing machines will be installed across the state - one machine for two districts.The machines will be handled by the sakhi mandals, who will also be responsible for transporting the packaged food to anganwadis. Some of the women will also be trained to become master trainers to mentor other women.To smoothly run these food processing units - with jobs ranging from installation of machines to transportation of packaged food - the sakhi mandals will be provided loans under Mudra Loan and Start-up India projects.Das said that since most of the malnutrition-triggered diseases were mainly caused by deficiency of protein, iron and fat, these factors should adequately be taken care of while preparing the ready-to-eat food.""For example, children like chocolates. We must make chocolates that can neutralise protein deficiency in their bodies,"" he stated later in a news release.The chief minister went on to say that since tomato, tamarind, peas and beans were abundantly grown in Jharkhand, his government would take initiatives to bring these to the food processing centres for production of sauces, jams and other products that would then be sold in the local market.""A healthy future generation is our primary objective. Money will never be a constraint to make our children healthy and sisters and daughters financially self-sufficient.

Along the 856km border between them, much of which is fenced, Indian families live outside the barrier, connected with gates manned by the BSF.On Sunday, when Assembly elections will be held in Tripura, these residents will come out of their caged existence to cast their ballots. At Jainagar here, 39 Muslim families had their homes on the wrong side when the fence came up nearly 12 years ago. Since then, their movements are restricted by the clock - the gates open at 6am and close at 8.30pm.Along the border, these gates are numbered. At Gate 86, young Sofikul seeks the BSF sentry's permission to come out with his bicycle and head to school. He needs to make a written entry and produce his identity card and a yellow gate pass issued by the BSF.Hasina Khatun, 55, needs to go back home inside the fence, so her name is marked on the register at the gate.She had accompanied her 32-year-old son, Bashir Mia to hospital to treat a deep cut on his palm. Hasina rues having to adhere to gate deadlines; it impinges on her freedom of movement especially when there are family celebrations in town. ""If we are late in returning, we have to spend the night with relatives outside. We appreciate the security, especially with our paddy fields and tomato patches safe from intruders.

The BSF sentries deposit the keys at the camp and the procedure to reopen the gates in an emergency involves securing permission from the authorities, the BSF company commander at Konaban in Sipahijala district, Pawan Yadav explains.Having travelled 60km along the fencing, with a lone sentry at each gate, one reaches the Kamalasagar company headquarters of the force. The security on this smuggling-prone stretch is double-layered: area domination patrols by day and ambush-cum-patrol teams at night.

Several factors seem to have ganged up to create such a situation.The APMC yard here has turned into a virtual trash bin as the fruits are rotting, but there are hardly any buyers. The furious growers are throwing the mangoes into the drains and on the roads. Among the reasons for the price crash are excess production and fall in demand from the middlemen.The rates have fallen to as little as Rs 10-12 a kilo for the Badami variety. The other varieties of mangoes are priced at Rs 4-5 a kg, down from Rs 100 a few days ago.Varieties like Sendur, Rasapuri and Neelam have no takers. Buyers purchased 240 quintals of Badami mangoes at Rs 900 to Rs 1,000 per quintal. Other varieties (740 quintals) sold at Rs 500-600 per quintal. Even tomato is commanding a better price than mangoes, say the growers.Many lorry loads of mango are returning to the market as some buyers are sending them back due to excesssupply. Earlier, these buyers, mostly juice producers, used to fall over each other to buy both ripe and raw mangoes. However, this time, the buyers are imposing conditions on what they want.Nipah scareThe scare of the spread of Nipah virus through mangoes has discouraged retail consumers from buying them and so, the demand has crashed. Besides, there is a glut in production in Kolar, another major production centre.Many growers have left the mangoes to rot on the trees as they dont want to spend on the labour for plucking in the current situation."

In the first phase, the state became cent per cent organic producer.D. K. Bhandari, the director of the horticulture department, said to begin with, two floors of the multi-storied complex would be given to the farmers to sell their produce. ""Later, 85 stalls in the complex will be let out to the farmers. The complex will also house two cold storages and a canteen,"" he added.Similar complexes will also be constructed at Namchi in South Sikkim, Geyzing in West Sikkim and Mangan in North Sikkim. ""The Kisan Bazar will be open on all seven days of the week. The farmers can sell their vegetables from these complexes at their own prices,"" said Bhandari.The horticulture director, however, said once a stall was allotted to a local farmer, he or she would not be allowed to sub-let the places to others. ""If anyone is found sub-letting the stall, the allotment will be cancelled. This is being done to ensure that no middlemen get to usurp the stalls,"" he said.The government has also provided utility vehicles at different locations to enable farmers to ferry their produce to the nearby markets.

""For instance, if we buy tomatoes from farmers at Rs 28 per kg, we will sell them at Rs 20. We will absorb the losses.

5b2e78bc9855b72640115dac,Farm crisis real but can be tackled,http://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/farm-crisis-real-can-be-tackled-667754.html,2018-05-02,,Deccan Herald,"One of the oldest civilisations, the Indus Valley civilisation, vanished because of persistent drought. This is a stark reminder to policymakers that they will have to tackle persistent drought in parts of the country failing which civilisation could disappear in a couple of centuries. Farm crisis in India is real, particularly in states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which is going to witness yet another drought this year despite good monsoon forecast for the third consecutive year in the rest of the country.This is one side of the coin but Agriculture Secretary S K Pattanayak, a Karnataka cadre IAS officer, argues that all is not bad with Indian agriculture. It has come a long way and this year India is going to have a bumper crop with food grain production touching a record 275 million tonnes, while horticulture, including fruits and vegetables, will produce a record additional 300 million tonnes. Also, the country has had a record bumper harvest of 23.6 million tonnes in pulses, the only source of protein to the vast vegetarian population.But the stark reality is that farming is the livelihood for half of the 1.25 billion people of India. A farmer must get a remunerative price and adequate income. Already next generation of farmers are moving away from farming and this could have a catastrophic effect on who will feed the 125 crore people, which is not a small number. Also, if the Indian economy has to clock a double-digit growth on a sustained basis, the farm sector has to grow by at least 4% annually on a continuous basis, which has not happened so far. This is necessary to ensure poverty is eradicated.For the woes of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu farmers, Pattanayak said they should change their cropping pattern from water-guzzling crops like paddy and sugarcane and switch over to drip irrigation, which will reduce water consumption drastically. It is a crime to cultivate sugarcane in Maharashtra. Sugarcane should be cultivated in flood-prone areas of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and perhaps the Northeast as it could also be flood protected.Punjab should not be cultivating basmati rice. The practice of which has brought down the water table to a dangerous level. Israel, which has a mere 300 mm of average rainfall, did not find water shortage a major problem and its farm yield is one of the highest. India gets bountiful rainfall and perhaps one of the few countries to have monsoon as a season every year.Even in the arid zones of Rajasthan and Karnataka, the average rainfall is around 800 mm, which is more than double that of Israel. All one has to do is harness this through rainwater harvesting so that fresh water does not go unutilised into the sea. The government, therefore, is rightly giving priority to minor irrigation and desilting of all the existing tanks, besides immediately taking up 99 stalled irrigation projects. This has to be done on a war footing.What is needed now is to make agriculture smart, which has not happened so far in India despite the Green Revolution that only ensured there are no more starvation deaths. Farmers income needs to be not only doubled but at least quadrupled from the present level of Rs 20,000 annually. One way could be to provide income support as in the US instead of price support by way of Minimum Support Price (MSP). Because of high MSP for certain crops like food grains, rich farmers grow these crops to take advantage of procurement as only they have a marketable surplus.The top 10% of Indian farmers produce 60-70% of marketable surplus in food grains. The remaining 90% have only 30% of marketable surplus and hence they get very little benefit from the price support system. The resulting depression of prices for poor farmers in the market leads to distress sale of the small quantity they produce.If income support is given instead, market forces will come into play and the farmer can produce any crop that the market demands and not only those that have price support, which leads to excess production and subsequent depression of prices. This will also ensure that crop failures do not hit farmers hard.If farmers income has to rise, the dependence only on agriculture for income has to change and farmers will have to take to animal husbandry, poultry, fisheries, food processing and other agri-related rural industries and so on for augmenting income. This is because farming by its very nature is seasonal and hence there is disguised unemployment even in the best of times.As the Swaminathan Committee has pointed out, market access to poor farmers is a major problem in India. Bumper tomato crop forces a farmer to sell it at Re 1 per kg but in the retail market, it is not available for less than Rs 20. But Re 1 does not cover even the cost of production. A farmer gets Rs 6 per coconut but in the retail market, it is not available for less than Rs 40. Who then gets the benefit? It is neither the farmer nor the consumer but the rich middlemen.So what is the way out? An Amul like cooperative model that brought about the White Revolution has to be replicated for all crops so that farmers get a remunerative price and the food products are marketed better and exported. The wastage of fruit, vegetables and other crops running into thousands of crores can be minimised. This will facilitate setting up of common cold storage for horticulture produce in areas where they are grown.Amul like cooperatives will also ensure crop insurance, better quality seeds, pesticides and other inputs, thereby minimising crop failures and loss of farm income.--(The writer is a senior journalist based in New Delhi)"

In 2016, $113 billion was spent on therapeutic and supportive care of those living with the disease, a figure projected to grow to $147 billion by 2021.In lay terms, cancer is the attrition of healthy cells due to loss of activity over time. Only those body parts and organs that remain active maintain blood flow essential to stay healthy; this purpose is served by regular exercise prescribed for fitness. Sedentary living is known to raise cancer risk especially that of colon or lung or among men and endometrial and breast cancer among women.""Physical activity: even if you don't lose an ounce, you'll live longer, feel healthier and be less likely to get cancer, heart disease, stroke and arthritis. It's the closest thing we have to a wonder drug,"" says Tom Frieden, former director, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Further, acknowledging the limited success of medications, health experts now advise integrated approach including exercise, yoga, vegetarian diet and psychological wellbeing for cancer and other ailments. After positive outcomes from multi-location studies, intake of antioxidant-rich lemon, ginger, turmeric, cucumber, ever part of Indian cuisine, is being advocated for prevention and treatment of cancers.Lab trials at Georgia State University have shown a 10,000 times superior efficacy of ginger and turmeric vis--vis chemotherapy in cancer. Advising reduced intake of non-veg foods, the American Institute for Cancer Research recommends no more than one-third of animal protein in daily diet.Lab studies have also shown efficacy of folate-rich vegetables and fruit, particularly the deep coloured ones which contain cancer-fighting nutrients and help maintain body weight. These include beans, sunflower seeds, green leafy vegetables,green tea, cabbages and tomato and berries. Adequate intake of water and other fluids that dilute toxic concentration of cancer-causing agents in the bladder is also recommended.What makes cancer management tough is the erratic movement of cancer cells and their rapid growth that follows no pre-determined pattern and transmits to other body parts damaging the normal cells. Second, most cases are detected in later stages due to the lack of awareness among people; many women ignore the problem and approach the surgeon only when a tumour has stretched 8-10 cm long.To provide affordable and equitable care, public awareness on cancer along with expanding screening centres needs to be our top priority, says Dr Anand Purushotham, director at King's Health Partners Comprehensive Care Centre. The third handicap in most developing countries is the resource crunch. ""India is spending less than half of what it should be doing on cancer care,"" regrets Dr Anand.Once diagnosed with cancer, those around the patient tend to socially ostracise him/her unfairly at times. Ironically, however, this is a phase when one needs greater moral and other kinds support to accept the condition and pass their remaining days with minimal stress and peace.A patient should be impressed upon, as CC Scott said, that the human spirit is stronger than anything that can happen to it. Small gestures like the presence of loved ones and normal conversations, delivering meals, accompanying the patient to a healthcare facility, supplying essentials, keeping them updated with events and involving them in activities of their liking can trigger positive vibes and facilitate recovery.People diagnosed with cancer should be treated the usual way, with just a little extra love so that they do not lose their morale to fight back against the disease. As Michael Landon, the American writer, stage artist, director and producer said before he died of pancreatic cancer in 1991, ""I'm going to beat this cancer or die trying."""

Keen to ensure that this happens, the government asked NITI Aayog to come up with suggestions. The latter prescribed three alternatives, namely: market assurance scheme (MAS) or price deficiency payments or incentives to private sector to buy farmers produce at MSP.Under MAS, agencies of the state buy the produce directly from farmers at MSP. Under the second option, the government does not buy, but instead it reimburses the shortfall in price realised from sale (albeit in the mandi) vis--vis the MSP. Under the third alternative, the private sector is incentivised to buy at MSP.In the follow through, a group of ministers (GoM) under Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh has approved nationwide implementation of MAS covering 23 agricultural crops, including wheat and rice. The scheme will cover up to 40% of the marketable surplus and cap the price loss (difference between farm harvest prices and MSP) to be eligible for compensation at 25% of MSP.The Union government, apart from absorbing procurement cost in full (roughly 15% of MSP), will bear 100% of the price loss up to 20% of the MSP and half the price loss between 20% and 25% of MSP. The states will share only half of the shortfall between 20% and 25%. Of the overall cost of the scheme, the Centres share would be 93.75% and the states will contribute 6.25%. The states will have to pay for any additional support they wish to give farmers.Though bandied about as a revolutionary step in the overarching mission of doubling farmers income, the expected outcome is doubtful even as the scheme holds dangerous portends for both the Union government and the states via increasing their respective subsidy bills.During 2017-18, the total payment on food subsidy under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) was Rs 1,40,000 crore, including Rs 1,15,000 crore towards excess of procurement price over the heavily subsidised issue price of wheat, rice and coarse cereals (Rs 1/2/3 per kg respectively) for sale through the public distribution system (PDS) and Rs 25,000 crore as incidental cost on storage and handling. Additionally, the government spent Rs 35,000 crore on the price support scheme for pulses and oilseeds, taking the total to Rs 1,75,000 crore.As for 2018-19, according to NITI Aayog, the total cost of MAS is estimated to be about Rs 1,11,000 crore. Of this, the Centre will bear about Rs 1,05,000 crore. Together with Rs 1,15,000 crore being the subsidy to cover the excess of procurement price over issue price under NFSA (same as last year), the total outgo would be Rs 2,20,000 crore. This is an increase of Rs 45,000 crore over the corresponding amount spent during 2017-18. Against the budget allocation of Rs 1,69,000 crore for 2018-19, this is higher by Rs 51,000 crore and will have a destabilising effect on the fiscal deficit.One wonders whether central agencies such as the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and state institutions have the infrastructure and wherewithal to carry out procurement operations on the scale contemplated under the scheme. The experience with similar schemes run in the past for specific crops, such as pulses, oilseeds, vegetables (onion, tomato, etc) scale does not instil confidence. That apart, with the compensation capped at 25% of MSP, besides limiting purchase to 40% of the marketable surplus would still leave farmers dissatisfied.Furthermore, has the government thought through the fate of millions of subsistence farmers who do not have a marketable surplus (they produce food primarily for self-consumption) and a vast number of landless workers who depend entirely on the PDS or market? While they have nothing to gain from the price support scheme, they will be hit by the inflation triggered by it; all the more when the quota for subsidised supply under NFSA, namely five kilos per person per month, is far from being adequate in relation to the need.The responsibility for disposal of the stocks purchased from farmers lies entirely with the states. In order that the state does not suffer a loss on its sale, it should at least realise the effective purchase price (MSP minus price loss support) plus the carrying cost. If it does not  the most likely scenario  then it could suffer loss. This would be in addition to their 6.25% share under the scheme and would be seriously destabilising on the overall finances of the state.The scheme is hugely negative for the finances of the Centre and the states besides for subsistence farmers and landless workers, even as the intended impact (albeit positive) on farmers offering marketable surplus will be seriously constrained by the weaknesses in state procurement, handling and distribution machinery.Policy reforms neededThere is an inherent flaw in the approach. The government is looking for an administrative solution to a problem that requires policy reforms. If the farmers are not getting a good price, it is because the markets for agri-produce are monopolised by intermediaries (in many cases, politicians or their relatives) licensed by state authorities to buy their stuff in designated mandis/market platforms.Even as the consumer pays a high price, the intermediaries/traders pass on only a fraction of it to the farmers. The solution lies in liberating the agri-markets from state controls and giving farmers more options to sell their produce. This can happen only if states bring about legislative reforms such as the abolition of the APMCs (agricultural produce marketing committees). Given that a majority of states are under BJP rule today, it should not be difficult for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to crack the whip.(The writer is a New Delhi-based policy analyst)"

Picture by Pradip SanyalPosta: Nearly 300,000 trucks across Bengal remained off the roads on Monday, marking the start of an indefinite strike against rising fuel price and third-party insurance premium.Supply of fish, vegetables and fruits could be hit, triggering a price rise, if the strike continues for another 48 hours, city wholesalers and retailers said on Monday.The supply of vegetables such as onions, chillies, cauliflower, cabbage and tomatoes is largely dependent on other states, including Maharashtra and Karnakataka, around this time of the year.The bulk of the supply reaches Calcutta in trucks. ""If a truck owner is left with Rs 3,000-4,000 at the end of a Calcutta-Mumbai-Calcutta trip, what's the point in plying trucks?"" Subhas Chandra Bose, secretary, Federation of West Bengal Truck Operators' Association, asked.""Fuel prices have gone up. Premium for third-party insurance has increased by Rs 13,000 to Rs 14,000... so has the salary of drivers and workers,"" he said. ""We will continue with the strike unless a solution is reached.""On Monday, rows of trucks remained parked across parts of Posta, Burrabazar, Dunlop, Sodepur, and along NH2 and Durgapur Expressway even as transport bosses tried to find a way to break the deadlock.Truck operators have been offered a chance to meet chief minister Mamata Banerjee, an official at Nabanna said.Some trucks plied across parts of Garden Reach and Metiabruz, though.""We hope the impasse ends soon,"" a transport official said. ""We have enough supplies. The truck operators had met the chief minister once when bus and taxi fares were being revised. They can meet her again to discuss the matter.""Apart from vegetables and fruits, the biggest concern is fish. The annual demand in Bengal is 1.9 million tonnes.Despite being among the top coastal states in fish production, Bengal has to depend on Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu for fish supplies.Calcutta needs 70-75 truckloads of rohu and katla from Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Odisha daily.""The consumption of fish has gone up following a slump in the meat market because of the rotten meat scare. If the supply is hit, we will face a huge problem,"" a fish dealer in Sealdah said.Truck operators said they had raised the matter of cops demanding bribes during their meetings with the government.

And food is an important part of it. So expect a thali, served on banana leaf, with more than 20 dishes.The staff will be staying over at the restaurant the previous night, in preparation. At 4am we shall bathe, don new dhoti-kurtas, pray and then cook, smiles K. Surendran Nair, the sweet 72-year-old Malayali head chef.Any auspicious occasion in Kerala is strictly vegetarian but you wont miss mutton as you dig into Aviyal (made of papaya, chal kumro, and coconut), Kootu Curry (made of channa, kachkolka, ol and carrots) and Pachadi (a tangy mixed vegetable curry).Since the meal is served on a banana leaf, most items are dry or have a thick gravy. Its just sambar, rassam and a Moong Dal preparation that are watery and will be served on the rice. The chef adds that the Moong Dal preparation is one of the toughest on his list. It uses jaggery and coconut milk and takes two hours to make, he says.Menons personal favourite is the tangy Mambazha mango curry, made of curd, coconut and chilli.The Rs 400 thali will be a lunch-only affair, as is the custom in the southern state, and prior reservations is a must. This part of town has many Malayalis working in the IT sector or studying in institutes like NUJS. They have been making bookings but for Onam we had more Bengalis.

We get ourselves some lebu cha or lemon tea. It is four o' clock in the morning and we are at Galiff Street in north Calcutta's Bagbazar area - the largest pet and plant market of Bengal.The street, according to the Kalikata Street Directory 1915, is named after one Mr Galiff, who was the Collector and Commissioner of Calcutta in 1824. Thereafter, it has been 60 years since the street changed name, but it is still referred to by the name of Galiff of the missing first name.Cold breeze from the Ganges, which flows parallel to the street, stings our faces that morning. Some people are still lying on the footpaths, ensconced in blankets. But the rest of the street is awake and stirring. The market, after all, comes alive once a week, on Sundays. It hosts vendors from all over the state. They start coming in from places such as Durgapur, Asansol, Midnapore - by the night train or bus the pre-vious night. Some arrive on lorries laden with wares.The chaiwala is perhaps not just a chaiwala. He lingers. And then, after a minute's small talk, asks if there is anything in particular that we are looking for. ""Birds, dogs,"" he asks. What about mongoose? Like the Wink Girl whose video is now going viral, his face registers a series of expressions. When he actually opens his mouth to speak again, he says - ""I don't know"" - but doesn't go away either.We order a second round of tea. As he pours it out in style from a height into the transparent plastic cups, it looks a liquid golden thread against the dark. He mutters a statutory warning, ""Police are patrolling the place. If they find such things here, they will seize them immediately."" Then, between furtive glances roadwards: ""You will get your mongoose. Go and check with the ones selling rats."" And before we know it, he has picked up his kettle and disappeared into the darkness.The rat-seller whom we needed to ask for the mongoose is fast asleep, so we decide to stroll around. One stretch is full of colour - dahlias, white, yellow, red and pink; shaggy chrysanthemums, dainty petunias, fifty shades of roses, long-necked Easter lilies, woolly-headed ball lilies, prickly cactuses peeping out of trunks... There are plants growing vegetables - cabbage, brinjal, tomato, cauliflower, green chillies... An undecipherable sweet smell hangs about. In places, however, it is overlapped by the pungent smell of weeds, worms and pesticides. One shop is selling what looks like ugly blobs on plastic sheets. Turns out to be suji poka or worms used in pisciculture.By now it past 5am. A father and son are selling boiled eggs - duck and hen - and generously buttered toast. We ask the man where we can find a mongoose. The response, however, comes from another. This person, too, is setting up shop, putting out to hang from a clothes line, fish and eels in small plastic packets half filled with water. ""You must ask the people who sell birds,"" he says and then abruptly turns his back on us.We pass a stack of empty aquariums, some of them are fancy and come with temperature control, we are told. These makeshift stalls are also selling pebbles used to decorate aquariums. There are seashells, barnacles, rocks.Suddenly the street is awash with soft orange light. Day is breaking in slow motion and heralding it is this mixed chorus of birds. The chirrups are emanating from tempos. One by one the cages are being off-loaded from these.A man is carrying a pole that is overhung with two giant cages segregated into compartments. And in these compartments are the chatterbox birds. Lovebirds, almost 20 of them, huddled together. A pair of cockatiels with proud powdered heads like French Dauphins. White pigeons - a rarity. Mynahs and some birds of the starling family.A young girl stands in one corner of the street with just one green parrot and several empty cages. She has come all the way from Jharkhand. She is saying in her singsong voice, "" Nau sau rup-iya, nau sau rupiya. Khaane seekh gayi hai, koi mehnat nahin hoga, bolti bhi hai."" She is selling the not-for-sale Indian parrot for Rs 900. She is vouching for its grooming - can feed on its own and speak in human tongue, too. And what can it say, we asked. She replies, ""Ram, Ram."" But of course. We keep moving. After all, we have to find the mongoose man.A few steps ahead of the girl, there is a cage with twin birds. They look like the parrot except for a blue patch throat down. The local name for it is neelmohun. ""It is rare,"" says the woman in a green sari, who is minding it.We come across other Indian bird varieties such as the bulbul, the plum-headed parakeet, the common mynah, Indian cuckoo, the Indian roller, spotted dove, kite, grey parrot, macaw, the Indian koel...The Wildlife Protection Act bans the trade and trapping of all indigenous birds, but on Galiff Street you will see Dickensian figures carrying one or more such birds in small netted bags and roaming the market to net buyers. These are, of course, the smaller birds. The bigger ones such as the macaw or grey parrot are available in the bigger shops on the street. Not that they have any better an arrangement. The birds, kept in small cardboard boxes to avoid police glare, often die of suffocation.""Do you sell the lokkhi pyacha,"" another difficult customer making queries. Lokkhi pyacha is the name for the white owl, so named because it is the goddess of wealth Lakshmi's vehicle, according to Hindu mythology. The woman selling the neelmohun does not bat an eyelid. ""Big or small,"" she asks, and then without waiting for a reply rattles on, ""The big ones come at Rs 12,000 a piece. The small ones cost Rs 6,000.""And where would these come from? There are shikaris or hunters who know these things, she changes the topic only to dig herself a deeper hole. ""We can order vultures and kites too,"" she says. They also arrange for home delivery of rare orders. Can we meet the hunters? Apparently we cannot unless an advance payment has been made.The neelmohun woman is from south Bengal's Sunderbans area. She travels for three-and-a-half hours every Sunday morning to sell her wares. There are also some others who come from Bongaon, in the North 24-Parganas. Can we ask the shikari to find us a mongoose? Suddenly, someone seems to have pushed the mute button on her. She points at a shop a few feet away; it is just starting to up its shutters.A middle-aged man is arranging his merchandise - white rats, guinea pigs, red-eyed rabbits. There is no sign of any mongoose. Does he not sell them? He smiles mysteriously and nods. He does not but he can help; it is available.You can also get a hamster. And tortoises, the star turtle or the red ear slider - these are usually kept on display in aquariums. All of it is contraband. And tortoise meat? What about the mongoose we have been chasing all morning? Can he get that or not? That annoying smile appears again. And he replies, ""Come a little later in the day and we shall see."""

Spain is not only a country that has sandy beaches which make it one of the best tourist spots. It is in the possession of rich cultural heritage, architectures that are nowhere less than splendid beauty, festivals that stay peculiar to the country, snow-capped mountains that are yet to be explored and much more. But something that attracts most of the tourists to Spain is its stress-free and relaxed lifestyle. People of Spain lead a life that is hard to find in any country, and you will find uncountable reasons to visit Spain for your next international destinations.Spain should be on everyones travel bucket list for so many reasons, and the best is that there are certain things that can only be found in Spain. The best way to explore Spain in a convenient way is by hiring Taxi. It will be the best way to see even the smallest beauty of the cities of Spain. Though the price will vary from city to city, sometimes it can be 2 to 3 times more to basic fare in bigger countries; a taxi is still the best option. Being a tourist it's troublesome to take a taxi for a good fare, instead, you can get the private transfer in Spain at Kiwitaxi website beforehand.Holy GrailThose practicing Christianity knows the concept of Holy Grail, and every single artwork, be it movies, paintings, books, and others have included the concept. But many dont know that the Holy Grail is located in the Valencia Cathedral of Spain and even the Vatican City, the religious capital of Christianity, has acknowledged it. The artifact stays well-protected in a bay on the wall and people offer their prayers here. Along with this, the Cathedral is famous for the preserved arm of St. Vincent of Saragossa. The place serves as a center of faith for many, and not everywhere you get to the see the Holy Grail.Bull FightingBull Fighting stays synonymous with Spain. All over the world, animal activists have been criticizing the act demanding to ban it, but Spain has no intention of letting go its traditional act. Bull Fighting takes place in all over the country and has been the very part of it for hundreds of years. Though it takes place in many parts of the country, the one being organized in Madrid is the best one, and Seville has the most authentic one sticking to the traditions.Flamenco ShowEvery country has some festivals that stay specific to its border, and out of many that take place in Spain, Flamenco Show is the one. The show is an old traditional form of folk music on which people dance in their own folk choreography. The show has not lost its value and continues to enjoy the same love and enthusiasm as it did when it was started in the 7th century as per the records.Scariest PathwayThis will certainly get into the nerves of adventure enthusiasts. The scariest pathway is located in the small village of El Choro, Malaga, Spain. The one meter wide, the pathway is known as Caminito Del Rey and was inaugurated by Alfonso XIII. 3000 meters long and 101 meters tall, this one will surely send chills down to your spine while you cross it.La TomatinaThis one needs no elaboration. La Tomatina is a festival that receives the maximum number of tourists from all over the world and it takes place in Bunol, a small town. People throw tomatoes on each other and enjoy to the fullest by dancing, eating, and drinking.These are some of those experiences that you will only experience in Spain and it will certainly fill you with happiness."

However, Trump could decide to exempt some countries from any measures, including its NAFTA trading partners and has indicated he might exempt Canada.A Mexican official said the Ross meeting would address Mexican concerns over trade in steel and tomatoes, noting that Mexico would retaliate against steel tariffs.Ross has said he would not be surprised to see countries challenge any steel tariffs at the World Trade Organization.There are concerns that stiff U.S. tariffs could raise global steel prices, which would impact Mexico. While Mexico is a large steel importer, it also exported approximately 4.5 million tonnes in 2016.'HARD TO ACHIEVE'Meanwhile in Mexico City, negotiators discussed the broad outlines of so-called rules of origin, which would have a big impact on the automotive industry.Talks were hampered by the absence of the chief U.S. negotiator, Jason Bernstein, who was unexpectedly called to Washington on Tuesday for consultations and is unlikely to return to Mexico.The possible delay in tackling the matter underlines the slow progress of the talks, which are supposed to wrap up by early April, but look set to drag on for longer.The current round of talks will also focus on closing chapters related to digital trade, telecommunications, technical barriers to trade, good regulatory practices, and sanitary and phytosanitary measures, according to an official with knowledge of the talks.Steve Verheul, Canada's chief negotiator in the NAFTA talks, reported some advances in Mexico City.""We're making reasonably good progress so far,"" he told journalists without elaborating.NAFTA talks have crawled along for the past six months, and Trump has threatened to walk away from the $1.2 trillion treaty unless major changes are made to benefit American interests."

We are looking at compressing the supply chains and creating appropriate climate infrastructure for natural preservation of TOP,"" Badal said.A sum of Rs 500 crore has been earmarked for this scheme.Farmers Producers Organisations (FPOs), agri-logistics processing facilities and professional management will be encouraged under this scheme, she added.Food Processing Secretary J P Meena said the key features of the scheme will mostly likely be ready by April.The vegetable clusters are already mapped in the country and need to work out backward and forward linkages for FPOs keen to take advantage of the scheme, he added.The 'Operation Greens' is similar to the 'Operation Flood' launched in 1966 which was the world's biggest dairy development program of the government."

However the peasantry, which has suffered heavily due to successive droughts and farm commodity price crash in the state, feels let down as the Budget has no initiative to offer relief from the debt burden.Kuruburu Shanthakumar, president of State Farmers Federation, had expected categorical commitment from the Modi government on implementing the Swaminathan Committee report, which Modi had promised to implement within 100 days of coming to power. However, he welcomed the Budget proposal to raise the minimum support price (MSP) of agricultural commodities to 1.5 times the production cost.The proposal is also to extend the MSP scheme to all the 89 crops. It was earlier restricted to 43. He also welcome Kisan credit cards extension to all farmers.Shanthakumar told The New Indian Express that declaring 100 per cent tax exemption for five years for farm produce firms being formed by the farmers is a positive move.Though the Budget has assured huge expansion of crop insurance scheme under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, the scheme itself suffers from many flaws. It needs to be revamped by making a village or farmers the basic unit of reference to pay the compensation instead of the present basic unit of a hobli or gram panchayat.I will give this budget 5 marks on a scale of 10 for the farm sector and will ramp it up to 7 if effective measures are taken to implement the proposals in the remaining one of the Modi government, Shantakumar said.On allocating Rs 500 crore for farmers who grow perishable commodities like potato, tomato and onion, horticulture expert S V Hittalamani said in Karnataka there are some saline agriculture belt which cannot be used for agriculture purposes.However, agriculture experts feel the budget does not help farmers. Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha president Kodihalli Chandrashekar said the budget outlay for agri sector is Rs 11,000 crore. How much of it actually goes to farmers? Whatever money is announced is for the seeds, fertiliser, manure and other facilities. Budget does not speak about loan waiver, he said.He further added that if the Centre can bear Rs 2 lakh crore to implement the 7th pay commission report, why cannot they waive the loan of farmers who are the backbone of the nation."

Initially, AP was synonymous with drought and cyclones. Continuous efforts in the last four years have showcased our resources and strength in various fields and now I am sure the State will register more progress with team spirit, he said, while underscoring the need for more coordination between officials and employees.On the second and final day of the Collectors Conference at his residence in Undavalli on Wednesday, the Chief Minister surprised the officials by describing himself as a team leader and coordinator. Stating that AP has put up a phenomenal performance and displayed excellent leadership, he said the credit for the achievements of the State goes to all.After overcoming all odds initially, we are entering the next level and it is time for all of us to work with more coordination, he said.Explaining about his conversation with former British prime minister Tony Blair as well as the prominent architect Norman Foster, he said on Monday Foster landed in Vijayawada to have a chat with him, while he was en route to Odisha. But, as I am preoccupied with a series of conferences like the Finance Ministers conclave, review meetings and the rally condemning the brutal assaults on girls and women, I could not meet him. After understanding that he could not meet me despite landing here on my own request, Foster decided to go to Odisha. But, after receiving proper information, I not only met him but also dropped him at the airport and had a conversation with him, he said.Naidu said he does not have any individual relationship with Foster. I met him as he is a great architect. In case I did not meet him personally, it would have sent a negative signal about our State at a time when we are in need of support of world-class architects for building Amaravati as one of the worlds best cities, he said.CS makes critical observationChief Secretary Dinesh Kumar pointed out that there will be no use except forcing the closure of the existing industries by allowing more cashew processing industries in Srikakulam district. When Srikakulam District Collector Dhanunjay Reddy sought more cashew processing units, the Chief Secretary said excess processing units are not needed for cashew.Industries Minister N Amarnath Reddy intervened and said that setting up of more processing units will generate employment. But, the Chief Secretary said that more units than the cashew production capacity will only force closure of the existing units.We can understand that there is immediate need for setting up processing units for tomato as the growers in Chittoor district are suffering losses. But, setting up more units for cashew is no way needed, the Chief Secretary said.

Though, some leaders feel it is premature to discuss alliances as there is one more year for elections, others opine that it is better for the TDP to prepare to fight alone. At present, the principal opposition YSRC and the BJP have turned bitter rivals of the TDP. Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan, who stood by the TDP-BJP alliance in 2014 polls, too, is targeting the ruling party and Left parties blame the Naidu government for being equally responsible along with the saffron party for the injustice meted out to the State. Despite Chandrababu Naidus recent meeting with the national leaders of Left parties in Bengaluru, TDP leaders are not sure whether any alliance with CPI and CPM will benefit it or not and they are also not sure on their stand on alliance as they are already sailing with Jana Sena.Against this backdrop, TDP leaders are of the view that they should be prepared to face elections alone instead of depending on alliances. In a brief interaction with TNIE at the venue of Mahanadu, several senior leaders opined that despite the fact that satisfaction levels among people have increased and the CM is confident of retaining power, they will have to be very cautious as there is possibility of all the opposition parties targeting the TDP.A senior leader said the TDPs decision to snap ties with the BJP and leave the NDA government at the Centre helped the party in shifting the blame for States woes to the Centre. If we continued our relations with the saffron party till elections, we may have suffered a lot in the upcoming elections. But, now, by organising a series of programmes, we are hopeful that the people will not bear no more grudge against the State government and, instead, find the BJP and the opposition parties, which are dancing to the tunes of the Centre, as villains, a senior leader said.A leader from North Coastal Andhra explained that at one stage opposition parties managed to convince the people about the guilt of the ruling party in not achieving special category status (SCS) in spite of being an ally of the NDA, by making a big issue out of it. But, after the TDP made the SCS as its main demand and left the NDA, they to some extent understood the TDPs position and its sincere efforts. We are hopeful the people will stand by us without being carried away by the rants of opposition parties. Minister Kalava Srinivasulu said at present the party was concentrating on strengthening its position in the State and will think of political tie-ups only before elections.Mahanadu SidelightsAccording to the 2017-18 fiscal status report of the TDP, which was submitted by party state treasurer and MLA Sidda Raghava Rao, the party has properties with a net worth of J104.15 crore. Its net income in the previous fiscal was J19.40 crore, while the expenditure stood at J16.73 crore. Of the total expenditure, J6.38 crore was spent on publicity, Raghava Rao said. It maybe recalled that a report published by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), last week, said that TDP had the second highest income (in 2016-17 fiscal) among the regional parties after Samajwadi Party. According the the report, TDPs 2016-17 income was J72.9 crore.Heavy traffic jam was witnessed between Benz Circle and VR Siddhartha Engineering College in Kanuru between 9.30 am and 11 am. Even though city police and TDP volunteers were deployed, thousands of vehicles ferrying TDP workers to the venue of Mahanadu sent the traffic for a toss. Beside, indiscriminate parking of two-wheelers and four-wheelers on the road added to the chaos.The first-ever Mahanadu, an idea conceived and implemented by TDP founder the late N T Rama Rao, was held in Vijayawada in 1983 in the 200 acres where Kamineni Nagar, Ganesh Colony, Sri Ramachandra Colony and others have come up now. Mahanadu Road opposite Dr NTR University of Health Sciences, leading to Autonagar has got its name after it was laid to facilitate the movement of vehicles for the first TDP conclave. Two more conclaves were held in the subsequent years. The Mahanadu, which kicked off on Sunday, is the first one since the State bifurcation.Ravva kesari, idly, mysore bonda, tomato bath, tea and coffee were served to the party workers as breakfastw. For lunch, about 20 varieties including apple halwa, Madras pakodi, vegetable biryani, kadai vegetable curry, dondakaya fry, mamidiyaka-aakura pappu, mulakaya-tomato curry, stuffed brinjal were spread out. At 3 pm, snacks were also given. On Monday, which also marks the birthday anniversary of TDP founder NTR, more than 20 varieties of food times, favourites of the late leader, will be served at the venue, according to TDP leaders.The party has put up the model of interlinking of Krishna and Godavari rivers through Pattiseema Lift Irrigation Project at the dais of the venue. The previous Mahanadu held in Visakhapatnam had the models of Polavaram project and Cyber Towers on either side of the dais.Speaking about elections, Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu stressed the need for studying Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs). Technology is always vulnerable to defects. Since we vote only once in five years, we dont have much knowledge of how EVMs work. So, there is a need to create awareness, he said and recalled that he was instrumental in ensuring Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) system along with EVMs.At the blood donation camp, close to 220 TDP workers donated blood. Meanwhile, TDP MP Murali Mohan and K Raghu Ramakrishnam Raju donated Rs 5 lakhs and Rs 20 lakhs respectively for the party welfare."

Last week, forecasts ran as high as $150 million for the four-day haul of ""Solo.""Overseas ticket sales were even worse. ""Solo,"" starring Alden Ehrenreich in the role made iconic by Harrison Ford, grossed $65 million internationally in its opening weekend, including a paltry $10.1 million in China.""Of course we would have hoped for this to be a bit bigger,"" said Dave Hollis, Disney's distribution chief. ""We're encouraged by the response that people have had to the film. It got a good CinemaScore (A-minus). The exits are very encouraging.""""Solo"" came in with a Millennium Falcon's worth of baggage following the mid-production firing of directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who were replaced by Ron Howard. With the rejiggered production, the budget soared well past $250 million.But the cause of the spinoff's disappointing performance may have had as much to do with ""Star Wars"" fatigue (""The Last Jedi"" exited theaters just last month) and the stiffer competition of a summer holiday weekend. While no major releases dared to open against ""Solo,"" Fox's ""Deadpool 2"" moved its release date up a week ahead of ""Solo.""The gambit may have hurt both releases. After debuting with $125 million last weekend, the R-rated Ryan Reynolds sequel dropped 66 percent to second place with $42.7 million and an estimated $53.5 million four-day haul.""Solo"" notched the biggest Memorial Day weekend opening in several years, but it also came on the heels of a pair of a summer-sized blockbusters  ""Deadpool 2"" and Disney's own ""Avengers Infinity War""  making for an unusually crowded May. ""Infinity War"" added $16.5 million in its fifth weekend to bring its domestic total to $621.7 million and its global sales to $1.9 billion  both among the highest of all-time.""It is a business that is built on momentum but also one where people probably are only able to get to theaters a certain number of weeks in a row,"" said Hollis.But there were also questions beyond the effect the calendar had on ""Solo."" While reviews were generally positive (71 percent ""fresh"" on Rotten Tomatoes), there was little about ""Solo"" that made the movie a must-see event.Fans were skeptical of Ehrenreich and uncertain about the dismissal of Lord and Miller (the popular filmmaking duo behind ""21 Jump Street"" and ""The Lego Movie""). Unlike any ""Star Wars"" release before, ""Solo"" was deemed  gasp  skippable.As it arrived in theaters, Disney might have been wishing it had instead made a Lando Calrissian spinoff with the red-hot Donald Glover, the star of TV's ""Atlanta."" In the days ahead of release, Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy said a Lando movie is a possibility.While the original ""Star Wars"" films helped define the summer moviegoing experience, Disney released their previous three ""Star Wars"" films in December. What most hurt ""Solo"" was the ""fatigue factor"" of a May ""Star Wars"" film following a December one, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for comScore.""It's the compressed timeframe between the two 'Star Wars' films and the highly competitive nature of this marketplace. It is summer, after all,"" said Dergarabedian. ""The good news is that the next film isn't until December 2019. That's plenty of breathing space. I think part of the allure of the 'Star Wars' brand in the past has been the long wait.""That time might also be valuable for Lucasfilm and Disney to find a way to counter the diminishing returns of its multi-billion-dollar franchise. To help propel ""Solo"" internationally, Disney brought the film to Cannes Film Festival, flooding the French film festival's red carpet with Storm Troopers.""The Last Jedi"" also flopped in China (it was pulled from theaters after a week), and Rian Johnson's movie  even though it grossed $1.3 billion worldwide  showed relatively weak legs at the box office, while proving divisive among ""Star Wars"" die-hards.The magic around a ""Star Wars"" film may be fading. To right the ship on Episode 9, Lucasfilm has turned to an old friend: ""The Force Awakens"" director J.J. Abrams. He, too, is replacing a fired director after Colin Trevorrow departed last fall.Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to comScore.

I leased a unit and processed fruit. In spite of the initial loss suffered due to lack of quality consciousness among the stakeholders, I went ahead with export. Today, there are 6,200 farmer producers with me, whose net realised value has touched 200%, Mr. Abdul Ali told The Hindu .FPOs distinctionToday, this is the second largest horticultural Farmer Producer Organisation (FPO) in the country, next only to a grape-based unit in Nashik (Maharashtra), he said.After tasting success in mango, Mr. Ali decided to replicate the Nashik example and brought exotic varieties such as seedless grape, pineapple, dragon fruit, grapefruit (a citric variety), passion fruit, and Italian tomato to ensure higher margins for the farmers.We have designed an ERP system to schedule cropping pattern to balance demand-supply, which our farmers are following, Mr. Ali added. This FPO also owns a fertilizer shop that runs on zero margin, thus saving 30% for the stakeholder farmers.Processing unitNow, the FPO is all set to launch a huge processing unit to handle 500 tonnes a day, an IQF facility to make frozen foods, a cold storage that can handle 2,000 tonnes, and pack houses to handle 50 tonnes per day.The profit will be shared among all the shareholders, he said, hoping the unit will come into operation next year."

I have requested assistance from the Government of India for the same,"" he said in a representation made to the Union Minister.To ensure that cooperatives are able to function effectively, the chief minister demanded for increase in the quantum of concessional refinance which National Bank For Agriculture And Rural Development (NABARD) provides from the current 40 per cent to 75 per cent of the ground level disbursement.""This will help us to provide timely and needy credit to small and marginal farmers,"" he said.To ensure farmers get credit at lower rate, the chief minister said that the government should raise the subsidy from 2 per cent to 3 per cent on crop loans for cooperatives.With regard to minimum support price (MSP) of crops, Mr Kumaraswamy asked the Centre to consider C2+FL formula while fixing the price instead of current A2+FL formula.He also suggested the central government to fix MSP for horticultural crops like tomato, onion and potato.Among other demands, the chief minister demanded the Centre to give a special financial package of Rs 2,477.26 crore for losses incurred by arecanut and coconut growers in the state.Coconut has been affected in 1.37 lakh hectare and arecanut in 95,352 hectare and the total loss is pegged at Rs 9,909.6 crore in the state, he added.""The state has prioritised farmer welfare in all its programmes and simultaneously initiated concerted efforts to achieve the goal of doubling farmers income by 2022,"" the chief minister informed in the meeting.The state has been perennially affected by drought with six out of last eight years being declared as drought years and farmers have endured adverse effect of severe successive droughts, he added."

(File)Blaming the previous governments for the state of the pilgrim city, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said he wanted to see it developed as a place with an ancient soul but in a modern shell.Addressing a public rally in Varanasi in his Lok Sabha constituency, he said change was visible in Varanasi over the last four years of his government.PM Modi urged the people of Varanasi to start preparing to welcome delegates from all over the world for the Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas (NRI Day), which will be held here from January 21 to 23 next year.The guests will also visit Allahabad for a 'kumbh darshan'.Earlier in the day, the prime minister had addressed another rally in Azamgarh and laid the foundation stone there for the 340-km Purvanchal Expressway.He will visit Mirzapur on Sunday, wrapping up his two-day visit to eastern Uttar Pradesh.In a symbolic inauguration in Varanasi, PM Modi launched development projects worth nearly Rs 1,000 crore for the city and the region around it. ""A new Banaras is being built for a new India; its soul will remain ancient but the structure will be new,"" he said.While its culture and traditions will remain, the city will have ""smart systems."" He began his speech in the local dialect and chanted 'Har Har Mahadev'.PM Modi condoled the death of at least 15 people when an under-construction flyover collapsed here in May.He said the city was in neglect when the Samajwadi Party was in power in Uttar Pradesh.""Four years back there were overflowing sewers, dangling cables, and traffic jams all over. The road from the airport was in a bad state due to which flights were missed,"" he said.PM Modi said the situation had changed now with cooperation between the BJP governments in the state and at the Centre.""The condition of the Ganga banks was also not good and all the waste used to flow into the river. The earlier governments were not concerned about this,"" he said.He said a large amount of money was earlier wasted in the name of cleaning up the river. The BJP-led government has now taken up the task of cleaning the Ganga from Gangotri to Gangasagar, and sanctioned Rs 21,000 crore for this.He said projects related to roads, transport, cooking gas, beautification, cleanliness and other schemes to help people living here were inaugurated today.""The change Varanasi is witnessing is helping nearby areas and villages. For the farmers, a perishable cargo centre is ready and potatoes, tomatoes and other perishable vegetables can be stored here. Farmers will not have to suffer losses,"" he said.""Whether it is roads or railways, new facilities are being made available for Varanasi. Doubling of track to Allahabad and Chhapra is on,"" he said.New trains will help people from Ballia and Ghazipur to come to Varanasi and return the same day, he added.He praised the Yogi Adityanath government in the state.""Tourism promotion and work on cleanliness and conservation of old monuments are being acknowledged. Swachh Bharat campaign has been taken forward by the UP government,"" he said.He said that impact of the state's industrial policy was also visible now.""The Samsung factory in Nodia was recently inaugurated by me. It will generate job opportunities. Mobile phone factories have increased from two to 120 in the past four years, of these over 50 are in UP,"" he said."

Larry Charles (@larrycharlesism) July 11, 2018The speed with which an ongoing tragedy has been mined for intellectual property, as if it were an old Marvel comic book, might seem distasteful. But it isn't a particularly new phenomenon.- - -""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""The Hurt Locker""One of the most striking recent examples is ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" Kathryn Bigelow's dramatization of United States government's hunt for and eventual killing of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. U.S. forces killed bin Laden on May 2, 2011, in what President Barack Obama called ""the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat al-Qaida."" The movie hit theaters in December 2012, barely a year and a half later.That's a remarkable turnaround time. Bigelow, though, was no stranger to tackling fresh issues. She won six Oscars, including best director and best picture, for her 2008 movie ""The Hurt Locker,"" which followed a U.S. bomb disposal team during the Iraq War. Though the movie was based on accounts of a journalist embedded in Iraq in 2004, it came out while the Iraq War was still underway.""Patriots Day"" and ""Stronger""The 2013 Boston marathon bombing, which killed three and injured hundreds more, was turned into two major, star-driven films.First came ""Patriots Day"" in 2016. The Peter Berg movie depicts Mark Wahlberg as Boston Police Sgt. Tommy Saunders as he searches for the bombers in the attack's immediate aftermath.Though movies based on recent tragedies are often subject to backlash, the reaction to ""Patriots Day"" was particularly fierce - especially in the Boston area. The movie, wrote Boston film critic Sean Burns, was ""as disgraceful an exploitation of real-life tragedy as I've ever seen. Everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves.""The Boston Globe's Ty Burr was slightly more forgiving, calling it ""slickly heartfelt"" and ""vaguely insulting.""A year later, ""Stronger"" hit theaters. Rather than focus on the police response, the David Gordon Green told the story of Jeff Bauman (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), a man who lost his legs in the bombing and was the subject of a famous photo from the day.This one was much more warmly received, perhaps because it was based on Bauman's memoir. It ""rises on the power of its well-chosen ensemble to offer an emotionally resonant fact-based story that transcends inspirational drama cliches,"" reads the critical consensus on Rotten Tomatoes, where it earned a 92 percent ""fresh"" rating.""United 93 and ""World Trade Center""The September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the United States was, by far, the country's deadliest. Perhaps due to this wretched gravity, Hollywood waited a bit longer to cash in on the horror. But cash in it did, with a pair of back-to-back movies. ""United 93 and ""World Trade Center"" were both released in 2006, within four months of each other.The first came in April, and as the title suggests, told the story of United 93 - the hijacked plane heading toward Washington, D.C., that crashed in Pennsylvania after its passengers attacked the hijackers. Paul Greengrass' account was met warmly by critics, but those connected to the actual event weren't as pleased.""It was both excruciating and beautiful at the same time,"" Alice Hoagland, whose son was on the flight, told the San Francisco Chronicle. After Marjorie Kase, who lost three friends in the 9/11 attacks, unexpectedly saw a trailer, she echoed others in telling the paper, ""I don't think the country is ready for this movie right now. We don't have enough perspective or hindsight on the matter.""Just as ""United 93 was coming out on DVD months later, Oliver Stone's account of first responders was hitting theaters amid far more mixed reviews - many of which deemed it exploitative.The World Trade Center attacks are still being mined for the big screen. ""9/11,"" starring Charlie Sheen and Whoopi Goldberg, came out just last year.With each release, it seems, those directly affected by attacks are forced to relieve the horrid day. Bill Doyle, whose son was killed in the Twin Towers, was particularly angry after seeing advertisements for 2012's ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,"" the Tom Hanks vehicle based on a Jonathan Safran Foer novel.""Everybody's trying to make money off 9/11,"" he told the New York Post. ""A lot of families got upset. Why couldn't they warn us about this? I don't think people really realized that these people are really still stressed.""""American Sniper""A year after Chris Kyle -- the deadliest marksman in United States history who had 255 confirmed kills during four tours in Iraq -- died in 2013, the Oscar-winning, Clint Eastwood-helmed depiction of his life (and death) titled ""American Sniper"" hit theaters.Made-for-TV moviesThe timeline also tends to be even shorter when it comes to the made-for-TV movies. Consider this: In May 1993, Tim Daly portrayed David Koresh in a small screen flick about the standoff between the police and the Branch Davidians - which occurred less than a month earlier."
5b540c319855b710b170da6e,A Town  Revered For Its Hams Is Losing A Slice Of History,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/smithfield-a-town-revered-for-its-hams-is-losing-a-slice-of-history-1887511,2018-07-22,,NDTV,"Salted hams are curing in the smokehouse at Darden's Country Store in Isle of Wight County, Virginia.The local charity run is the Hog Jog. The mascot for the wine festival is Pig-o-noir. October brings the Bacon & Bourbon Fest. The town museum promises the ""World's Oldest Ham."" The rescue truck at the volunteer fire department is named ""Hamtown Heavy.""You could say Smithfield is a little obsessed with pork products, but that would understate how deeply hogs are woven into the history and life of this town of about 8,300 on a hill over the Pagan River. So it has come as a shock that Smithfield Foods is shuttering the last smokehouse that produces the area's signature product, the genuine Smithfield ham.""Really? You're going to do this?"" was the reaction of local historian and former Smithfield Foods executive Herb De Groft, 77. ""Country meats are what brought this area to the fore in the 1800s. Word was, the Queen of England used to get one Smithfield ham a year.""The salty, long-cured ham has been an area staple since the English colonists and their hogs arrived at nearby Jamestown in the early 1600s. There is a whole section of Virginia State Code - Title 3.2, Chapter 54, Article 4 - entitled ""Smithfield Hams."" Just as the French define Champagne and the European Union protects Greek Feta cheese, Virginia law dictates that genuine Smithfield ham is cured in Smithfield.Jennifer England stands next to a case of antique hams at the Isle of Wight County Museum.""Anybody can make a ham,"" said Jennifer England, director of the local museum, where pig fanciers can keep tabs on a ham cured in 1902 via the online ""Ham Cam."" ""But a Smithfield ham can only come from within the town itself.""The company has said little about its plans since the Smithfield Times newspaper broke the story about the smokehouse last month. A Smithfield Foods spokeswoman said that the smokehouse had reached the end of its useful life and that the company has plenty of genuine Smithfield hams stockpiled to satisfy immediate demand.""We're currently meeting about the future of the smokehouse and I don't have many details to share at this point. Should know more in the coming weeks,"" spokeswoman Diana Souder said via email.The smokehouse is said to be more than 50 years old, but whether the company will build a new one, seek a change in state law or simply abandon the ""genuine Smithfield"" moniker is a matter of local speculation.Smokehouses once sat cheek by jowl, so to speak, in the little town, but local ham producers have been consolidating for years. Names like Gwaltney, Luter and Todd - a roll call that can make an old Virginian's mouth start to water - were absorbed into the giant Smithfield Foods, which itself was purchased five years ago by the Chinese conglomerate Shuanghui Group, now known as WH Group.An outsider might think selling out to a foreign company would be the thing that set off local alarm bells. But the headquarters remained in a beautiful riverfront complex, the executives are all American, and Smithfield Foods stepped up its involvement in local charities and community events.""Hey, selling to a Chinese company was a very smart move,"" said De Groft, who retired from Smithfield Foods more than 20 years ago. China, he pointed out, is the world's biggest market for pork products.The huge meatpacking plants on the edge of town slaughter more than 10,000 hogs per day. On a hot summer afternoon, the sickly sweet smell of the plants settles on the little downtown, where the most modern houses are Victorian confections and some buildings have been absorbing hog aroma since before the Revolution.""They say that's the smell of money,"" said Caroline Darden Hurt, 75, a retired history teacher whose family has farmed in the area since the 1600s.There is plenty of ham still coming from Smithfield Foods, the world's biggest pork producer. Some of it is even salty - Virginia ham and country ham are generic types produced by many companies. But they are not genuine Smithfield hams.A Smithfield ham is long-cut, with loin attached. Most country hams are short-cut. Old-timers will tell you the curing process - high in the smokehouse rafters over a long, sweltering summer - creates particular amino acids and salt deposits as the moisture disappears from the meat.But it's more than that. It is history and culture in food form. The first English settlers salted hams to preserve them; the Native Americans showed them how to smoke meats. A Smithfield ham is the result of both. Paired with a biscuit, served with Brunswick stew or peanut soup, finished with chocolate chess pie - that's southside Virginia, the sandy soil, the pine trees, the hot, flat peanut fields.Hurt, the retired history teacher, remembers people sharing hams on Sundays. ""Growing up, you could always tell one farmer's ham from another's. There were subtle differences. A ham cured in Suffolk or somewhere else just doesn't taste the same,"" she said.Originally, a hog destined for a Smithfield ham was turned loose on harvested peanut fields to glean the remainders. The peanut oils infused the meat. As hog farming grew in scale in the mid-20th century, though, the requirement that Smithfield hams be peanut-fed was removed from state law.Creating a Smithfield ham takes commitment. The cut hams are coated in salt and left to cure for more than a month; hung in a smokehouse and smoked for up to a week, until the color looks right; then left to hang and age for six months or more.Cooking a Smithfield ham is a ritual of its own, often caught up with Thanksgiving or Christmas memories, the salty meat soaking for a day or more before being washed and cooked and sliced tissue-thin.""The tourists come in looking for it specifically,"" said Leigh Abbott, general manager of the Smithfield Inn, which dates to 1752. ""I think the locals get a little tapped out on it. Though bacon unites everybody.""Across the street from the inn, a genuine Smithfield ham can cost from $150 to $200 at the Taste of Smithfield restaurant and store.Some old-fashioned producers remain in the surrounding countryside. Edwards hams are well-known in nearby Surry County, though a smokehouse fire caused a shortage a few years ago. Felts hams are big in Southampton County.Just outside Smithfield, at a crossroads among the cotton fields of Isle of Wight County, Tommy Darden carries on the tradition at his Darden's Country Store.""My daddy, he [cured hams] most all his life,"" Darden, 71, said. He and his wife keep a smokehouse across the street. They buy fresh-cut hams from Smithfield foods then cure and smoke them by hand.Though he can't, by law, call them genuine Smithfield hams, that's essentially what Darden makes. The short-cut variety that passes for country ham, he said, just can't compare.He's worried about the last smokehouse in town closing.""We're really not sure what that's going to entail, but we think it's not going to be good,"" he said. ""It's something that made them famous, something that put them on the map, something that everybody knows and relates to them with, and it's not going to be here.""Darden has 950 hams hanging in his smokehouse. He salted them in February, hung them in mid-March. They dangle from the dark rafters like props in a Renaissance painting, the surfaces rough with salt, the air pungent and rich. They were ready to cut down and cook on the Fourth of July.With a basket of tomatoes and a basket of ham biscuits on the counter of his shop, Darden said he will never get tired of the salty meat.""I like to eat a chicken salad sandwich with a slice of ham on it and tomato,"" he said. ""To me, that's absolute good."""

It will increase trade and eventually benefit farmers of Banaskantha, Sabarkantha and Patan,"" he had said.Responding to Vaghani's barb at Mistry, Gujarat Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi Monday said the BJP leader should first clear his party's stand on the ""invitation extended by the Gujarat government to Pakistan for the upcoming Vibrant Gujarat Summit"".""BJP leaders had promised to teach a lesson to Pakistan ahead of 2014 Lok Sabha polls. But now, their government is spreading a red carpet for Pakistan. The BJP should first explain this sudden change. They owe an explanation to the people of the country,"" said Doshi.After the invitation was extended to Pakistan, office-bearers of the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) had claimed that it was only a ""general circular"" meant for around 285 global trade bodies, and final invitation will be sent only after scrutiny.On December 27, Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation Vice Chairman and Managing Director D.Thara said a Pakistani trade delegation may attend a two-day convention for the MSME (Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises) sector during the upcoming summit."

Of the targeted 1.34 lakh hectares, only 90,000 hectares went for groundnut sowing during the Khariff season, of which less than 40,000 hectares saw harvesting. For the ongoing Rabi crop, the groundnut acreage dipped by about 80%.Paddy too fared badly, with even the eastern mandals that are known for their success stories doing poorly this year due to a prolonged dry spell. Though the target was set at 42,000 hectares in the eastern mandals, the acreage plummeted to half, with low yields.Sugarcane farming received a big jolt in the district due to adverse climate. Generally, the district used to have sugarcane farming in about one lakh hectares, but in 2018 it slipped to below 20,000 hectares. With closure of two cooperative sugar factories and non-remunerative prices for the tonnage, a majority of the farmers resorted to growing alternate crops.Tomato fares betterThe tomato sector fared slightly better, with profits being reported in August and September which took the pressure off an otherwise bleak year that saw yields staying low. During peak season, the Madanapalle tomato market yard receives stocks to the tune of 1,200 metric tonnes per day, with transactions crossing over Rs. 1.5 crore a day. However, the daily arrivals fell below 250 tonnes a day this year.Host of issuesOther predominant issues faced by the farmers this year were an unprecedented shortage of farm workers and a failure of alternative and intercrops. Some small-scale farmers reportedly took up NREGA works and temporarily migrated to Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to make a living as workers in the construction industry.Joint Director of Agriculture Vijay Kumar admitted that the year was disappointing. The major problem was the minus 48% deficit rainfall in the district. However, we are happy that farmers slowly switched over to natural farming. We have reached a target of 1.59 lakh hectares in acreage. As the declaration of drought mandals took place early in June and July, it helped several farmers stay away from their fields or going in for alternative crops, he said."

While speaking during the one-day winter session of Haryana assembly, the CM also announced to include raw potato in the Bhavantar Bharpai Yojana (price difference compensation scheme) from Friday onward.With the announcement of hike of Rs 10 per quintal in the sugarcane prices on Thursday, Haryana has become the first state in the country to increase state advisory price (SAP) for the crop this year as none of the other states had done that so far. Haryana is giving highest price in the country of sugarcane to the growers, the CM claimed.Khattar said that girdawari was being conducted in the state to assess the damage to crop due to hailstorm in different parts of Haryana this month. Compensation on account of damage to crop due to fire had been distributed by the respective deputy commissioners. Letters have been written to all the DCs directing them to give details of the remaining such cases so that compensation could be disbursed to those left out, he added.To remove shortcomings in the girdawari conducted manually by the department concerned and enhance accuracy to assess the damage to crops due to water logging, rain, and hailstorms, it had now been decided to set up an online portal, Khattar said. A farmer would have to give details concerning his crop and area under cultivation on this portal, which would be double checked by agriculture and farmers welfare department and revenue department so that he did not face any problem while getting claims from insurance companies and banks, the CM said.While referring to the Bhavantar Bharpai Yojana, the chief minister said that potato, tomato, cauliflower and onion were now being covered. If any farmers got price less than the minimum support price for these crops, the state government would cover the price deficit for farmers, he said, adding that 18,000 farmers cultivating 48,000 acres had so far register themselves. He said that besides the government and the concerned departments, it was also the duty of MLAs, even of the opposition parties, to make the farmers aware in their respective areas of these schemes so that maximum people could benefit.Soft loans from cooperative banks were being provided to farmers on 0% interest rate, the CM said. Apart from this, compensation amounting to about Rs 890 crore had been distributed to farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojanaduring the last three years in Haryana, of which Rs 229 crore had been given to farmers of Sirsa alone."

The apology came hours after Mahila Congress workers hurled eggs and tomatoes at his residence even as BJPs Mahila Morcha took out a candle march, demanding his resignation.I regret if my remark hurt anyone. My intention was not to hurt the victims family, who belonged to my constituency (Pipili), Maharathy said a couple of days after he had welcomed a local courts decision to acquit brothers Prashant and Sukant Pradhan for want of evidence and said truth has prevailed.Sources said with Lok Sabha and assembly elections round the corner, Maharathys comment could have put the BJD and the state government in a difficult situation, and hence he tendered the apology.It must be mentioned that Maharathy had earlier reportedly tried to shield the rape accused and it is believed the episode had played a role in his removal as agriculture minister in January 2012.Livid at Maharathy backing the acquittal, hundreds of Mahila Congress workers staged a demonstration in front of his residence near Lower PMG here. The agitators tried to barge into the ministers house, leading to a scuffle with the police. The protesters then threw eggs and tomatoes at his residence.In fact, Maharathys apology could not calm Mahila Congress workers, who demanded his resignation. We want his resignation, not an apology. He made a mockery of the victim by welcoming the acquittal of the two rapists, state Mahila Congress president Sumitra Jena said. Bureaucrat-turned-politician Aparajita Sarangi of the BJP said Maharathy should step down for hurting the sentiments of the people with his irresponsible remark. It is surprising that the state government talks of womens empowerment and 33 per cent reservation for women in assemblies and Parliament, but its cabinet minister makes such insensitive comment, Sarangi said.A delegation of BJP Mahila Morcha also visited the victims village and met her family members. We had earlier raised doubt regarding the Crime Branch probe and demanded a CBI inquiry. The acquittal of the accused exposed the sloppy investigation by the state agency. Since the accused are now free, our lives are in danger, the rape victims mother said.Additional director general of police (Crime Branch), Santosh Upadhyay, said the probe agency has initiated the process to challenge the acquittal in the high court. We have asked the director (prosecution) to move the Orissa high court, challenging the acquittal, Upadhyay said."

Many of the students, it added, were left traumatized.The Post launched a database in April tracking incidents of gun violence on campuses since 1999. It found that in 2018, there were 25 cases of school shooting nationwide; a total of 25,332 students were exposed to such carnage; 94 students were shot, among whom 33 were killed and 61 were injured.The 2018 figures in all the above statistics categories set new records in almost two decades. US campuses, as a result, witnessed the most serious devastation brought by gun violence.School systems in every US state and the District of Columbia -- irrespective of demographics or affluence, location or security -- had several lockdowns in the last school year, which ran from the autumn of 2017 to the summer of 2018, the report said.""In fact, on every school day between Labour Day in September 2017 and Memorial Day in May 2018, a campus in this country went into lockdown because of a shooting or the perceived danger of one,"" it said.On February 23, 2018 alone, 33 incidents were reported on campuses all around the country, triggering 67 lockdowns and affecting 50,427 students, a chart in the report illustrated.Children affected by lockdowns during the last school year covered all age groups. More than 1 million elementary-age kids were witnesses of an incident, of whom at least 220,000 are kindergarteners or younger ones, meaning they were mostly under 7 years of age.Experts on childhood trauma said they believe ""a meaningful percentage of"" the affected kids will sustain long-term consequences, including worsening academic and social progression, depression, anxiety, poor sleep, post-traumatic symptomatology and substance abuse.Regardless of how small an imminent threat is, it could be very challenging for school administrators in that they have to respond to the situation in a matter of seconds, the Post said."

It is wonderful to see people thronging the place with their families. Such a response encourages the organisors do something bigger and better every year, said Munda."

You may actually be getting home a lot more than what you had bargained for. A variety of vegetables sold in markets of Hyderabad are laced with harmful chemical pesticides and can pose serious health hazards. At times, the toxic content even exceeds maximum permissible limits.Analysis of vegetable samples in the last one year by the National Institute of Plant Health Management (NIPHM), Hyderabad, revealed that many samples contained residues of about two dozen pesticides. NIPHM collects vegetables from markets and farm gates in the city every month to detect the presence of pesticides, if any.City doctors warned that consumption of vegetables laced with pesticide residue, even within permissible levels, may lead to severe health issues, which includes damage to the kidneys and brain. Human body tends to accumulate pesticides and when it crosses the tolerance limit, severe health problems surface.A study of the NIPHM monthly reports for 2018 reveals the presence of many toxins in vegetables such as tomato, brinjal, cabbage , okra, green chilli, French beans, coccinea, bottle gourd and cauliflower. Some of the chemicals are not recommended, which means they are not meant for human consumption or spraying on vegetables.Senior physician Dr Hari Kishan Boorugu of Apollo Hospitals, Hyderguda, Hyderabad, said each pesticide was associated with different health problems. A little quantity of pesticide may not cause harm, but it creates severe problems in the long term. Organophosphorus pesticides can damage nerves, he said, warning that pesticide-poisoning issues ranged from nerve weakness, muscle wasting to diarrhoea. Often, high doses could cause seizures.In October (latest month for which data is available) NIPHM analyzed 20 cabbage samples randomly collected from markets in Shamshabad and Budvel. Five of the samples were contaminated with residues of Alachlor and Malathion. In September, two of the 25 samples of cabbage collected from Shamshabad, Mehdipatnam and Kothapet contained Pyraclostrobin and Novaluron.Five of the 27 samples of cabbage collected in August from Shamshabad, Mehdipatnam and Dairy Farm showed the presence of residues of Carbendazim, Metalaxyl, Captafol, Thiophanate methyl, Indoxacarb, Novaluron and Ethion. In July, all the 15 samples of capsicum collected from Mehdipatnam and Shamshabad had residues of Acephate, Carbendazim, Imidacloprid, Flusilazole, Tricyclazole, Fenpropathrin, Phenol,4-Bromo-2-Chloro, Bifenthrin and Thiophanate methyl.Twenty samples of capsicum collected from city markets in June were contaminated with nine pesticides. In May, 14 samples of cauliflower were analyzed and 10 of those were found contaminated with six pesticides. Three of the 10 samples collected in April had pesticide residue. During March, of the 10 samples collected from Mehdipatnam, Hyderguda and Monda market, none had pesticide contamination.In February, 29 of the 71 vegetable samples had residues of 19 pesticides. In January, 48 samples were studied and 17 were contaminated."

The words describe this festival perfectly and the celebrations are in full swing in my house. The Christmas tree is up with blingy lights and lots of gifts are waiting to be unwrapped. At school, the kids are learning a new carol every day and belting it out proudly at the top of their voices just when I need a moment of peace. And, yes, most importantly, the mistletoe is ready for some loving kisses! For me, Christmas is about good food, wine and being with the people I love.Every person has his or her own way of expressing their love and gratitude. For me its all about cooking and sharing the pleasures of good food with my family and hosting dinner parties for friends.As you can imagine, my kitchen is super busy these days and the alluring aroma of whatever is baking in the oven fills the house, replacing the cold air with a cosy warmth. I have been doing a line-up of dinners in red, white and green. My favourite is this Portobello Mushroom, Baby Spinach And Roast Tomato Quiche in a light wholewheat crust. I serve it with a millet and greens salad for a healthy wholesome dinner.The Mexican Tortilla Lasagne is my take on the overdone Mexican fajitas and tacos. I make it just like a lasagne, but replace the pasta sheets with tortilla wraps and make multiple layers with Mexican black bean filling, fresh spicy salsa and grated cheddar or mozzarella cheese. Cover with foil and bake in the oven at 180C for 20 minutes and a further 10 minutes uncovered. Its delicious comfort food!Making mulled wine and stocking up bottles of it is an annual event at home. It is as simple as slow-cooking red wine with a bit of sugar, cinnamon, star anise, cloves, orange and lemon zest and some vanilla till the flavours have all come together. Aaah, cant you smell it already?Talking of mulled wine, I want to share with you my classic Berry Mulled Wine Sauce recipe. I make a jar of this goodness and keep it in the fridge. Just heat it up and serve over ice cream, cheesecake, panna cotta or simply sandwich it between two cookies for that little bite of indulgence. You can use strawberry, blueberry or any other berry, frozen or fresh.My Spiced Apple Cake is adapted from chef Ottolenghis recipe (you would have seen him on the popular MasterChef Australia last season). So easy to make but so delicious and good-looking. Ditch the classic apple pie and try making this, it definitely makes a humble apple look super glamorous in this glitzy season! Enjoy it as it is or heat it up and pair it with some vanilla ice cream.While we have sorted out the adults with some mulled wine, we need something special for the little elves to drink while hopping around the Christmas tree. Since strawberries are in season now, I created a fun Strawberry Mint Lemonade that is a big hit with my kids. Add in some fresh mint and green lime slices and you have a beautiful pop of colours to fit into the festive spirit. And if you spike it with a dash of vodka or white rum, you have the perfect cocktail.I hope you enjoy making and sharing these goodies. As for me, I am off to southern Italy to celebrate Christmas with my husbands family. And what is it all about? You guessed it, eating, drinking and more eating! Seasons greetings and happy holidays from me to you!Spiced Apple Cake Image credit: Natasha CelmiSpiced Apple CakeIngredients130g salted butter at room temperature150g castor sugar3 eggs, whisked2tsp vanilla essence300g all purpose flour1tsp baking sodatsp salt200g plain yogurtFor the apple mix3 large apples, cut in wedges100g brown sugartsp cinnamontsp cardamom, crushedtsp lemon zestMethodPreheat the oven to 160C.

She had gone to the Khan Market eatery, and enjoyed her chorizo and baby potatoes with wilted spinach and poached egg so much that she had a second helping of the same dish. I am, at present, not on speaking terms with chorizos and other porky products, but still thought Sly Granny deserved a dekko. Then, just a few days ago, we got a call from a dear friend. Were we free to have lunch with her and her daughter (our much loved niece)? The answer to that was pithy: Yes, we said.So there we were in Khan Market one sunny afternoon, looking for Sly Granny. I asked around, and was told to take the middle lane, turning left if we were approaching it from Bahrisons. Sly Granny is on the left, on the first floor. The address is 4, Khan Market, and the phone number for booking your tables (which you should do, because it was rather busy on a weekday, too) is 011-4905 8941.The dcor is pleasing, with nice old-style posters on the staircase and the walls. And on the window sills they have lots of fresh herbs growing, which are added to salads and other dishes, we were told by the helpful servers. Sly Granny, which has a branch in Bangalore, opened in Delhi in August.We asked for chicken salad with walnut and celery  from the small plates section. Our friend wanted fish moilee with curry leave rice and kasundi jhal muri, and the niece, mushroom and black olive tortellini. My wife asked for the roast chicken with garlic mash, asparagus, green beans and win jus and I, the grilled fish. Mine was a Calcutta betki, which is a fish that I enjoy, and the friends moilee was sole. And for dessert, since we were told brie en croute would take some time, we asked for lava cake and affogato.Crispy textureEvery dish was superb. The walnuts in the salad were crunchy, and the chicken had infused in the flavours of celery. The moilee was a bit different, and we had been told that the fish would be crumb fried. So the dish consisted of a little mound of flavoured rice with two pieces of golden fried fish on top, and some sauces on the side. The friend loved it. My fish was delicious, too. It was firm within with a crispy texture and came with a lemon-garlic butter sauce on a bed of lip-smacking buttered and mashed potatoes and topped with micro greens (from the window sill!). I squeezed a piece of lemon over it, and it was like nirvana.The mushroom and black olive tortellini was nice and rich, and had a sauce prepared with basil cream and brown butter and flavoured with sage and toasted pine nuts. I had a bit of the chicken (with garlic mash, asparagus, green beans and win jus)  and thought it was amazing. It had a crispy skin, while the flesh was juicy and tender. We ended our meal with a rich lava chocolate cake served with vanilla ice cream, and the affogato, a nice mix of bitter and sweet tastes.This is a place that is known for its food  its Salmon Gravalax (salmon cured with salt, sugar and dill), pulled chicken tacos with tomato chutney and pickled onions, duck ragout tagliatelle and black pepper salmon. But I know what I am going to go back for once pigs and I resume our happy relationship (happy for me, that is, alas not so happy for the poor pigs). I will have their biscuits and gravy  buttermilk biscuits, pork sausages, sage and bacon gravy.I am counting the days. 10, 9, 8..."
5ce56648e8e3fc56af40bc2d,"Breakfast, lunch and dinner in Melbourne",https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/food/breakfast-lunch-and-dinner-in-melbourne/cid/1679623,2018-12-22,,Telegraph,"Melbourne is a big city with a heart like London and the soul of old-world Australia. The city witnessed a Gold Rush for a few decades, onwards of 1850, and was set to be the next New York, so youll find marvelous remnants of Victorian architecture and ornate lattice-decorated homes alongside a thriving central business district. The centre of the city is all walking distance and is interspersed with restaurants and trendy bars. It is a fabulous city in which to unwind since it has a lively outdoor cafe life, wine bars and the two wine-growing areas  Mornington Peninsula and Yarra Valley, both great weekend getaways and an hours drive away. Meanwhile, here are my 10 must-do things in Melbourne.Collins Kitchen, Grand HyattHave your breakfast here. Grand Hyatt must be one of the best locations for any city hotel and its breakfast is so stunning in terms of quality and variety that you can easily skip lunch that day. It isnt surprising that they have won the Gourmet Travellers Best Hotel Breakfast Award for three years running. A unique feature is the range of fresh juices squeezed on the spot in any combo you want and the smoothies. Anyone who loves Asian food would be delighted with the restaurants wok-and-steamer station (yes for breakfast!). They do all the baking and viennoiserie in-house. Croissants, predictably, are just perfect.Geloso Gelati at Queen Victoria Market, which is spread over seven hectares Image: Karen AnandQueen Victoria MarketSpread over seven hectares, Queen Victoria Market is the largest open-air market in the southern hemisphere. Around 1,000 traders sell everything, from exotic Australian fruits and vegetables, local and imported gourmet foods, meat, fish and poultry to hardware, clothing and authentic Australian artefacts and souvenirs. Its a traditional Victorian structure built in 1878 during the heyday of the citys Gold Rush.The best way to understand how the market operates and a chance to meet some of the third and fourth generation vendors is to enroll for the Ultimate Foodies tour. I had Carmel guiding me around and she was a wealth of information, plus the exercise allowed me to taste without feeling embarrassed. Merchandise is removed from the stalls at the end of each trading day. It is a reflection of the eating trends in the city today with a lot of organic produce, kangaroo and game and a huge range of smoked meats, olives and cheese. It is also home to new and upcoming eateries and food concepts like the one I stumbled upon, Geloso Gelati.Queen Victoria Deli is a hidden gem of the food and cafe scene Image: Karen AnandHidden Secrets tourI thoroughly enjoyed the Hidden Secrets tour with Fiona Sweetman. I enrolled on the Cafe Culture walk but Fiona was flexible enough to take me to some of Melbournes designer shops, point out some hip and happening rooftop bars and have a great cup of coffee in the bargain. Diverting from the main drag of coffee-lined laneways, the Cafe Culture walk takes you on a tour of Melbournes hidden-away food and cafe scene, meeting people who are passionate about tea, coffee and food. Most importantly, you discover places you would never have found on your own and get a real taste of Melbournes unique flavour. They also do history and architecture walks and a progressive degustation for hardcore foodies.Chin Chin, a wacky Melbourne eatery Image: Karen AnandLunch at Chin ChinA breath of fresh air on the Melbourne eating-out scene, this is a wacky Melbourne eatery down Flinders Lane. The staff are young and perky and the food pretty amazing. Must-try items are the Barramundi and Crispy Pork Salad, the most amazing Tom Yum Soup I have had in a long time and the Jungle Curry with Steamed Fish and Diamond Clams. If youre uncertain of what to order, just go for the Feed Me#1 where they give you a selection of their favourite dishes until you say no more. Theyve also produced two very good cookbooks. I highly recommend Chin Chin, the cookbook.Pellegrinis is a must if you want to understand the history of Italians in Melboune Image: Karen AnandCoffee and strudel at Pellegrinis Espresso BarHundreds of Italians immigrated to Victoria in the late 19th century and then after World War II when many agricultural workers from southern Italy chose to settle down in Victoria to escape the economic hardships back home. The area around Bourke Street in central Melbourne is where many of them started small businesses, restaurants and coffee shops. Pellegrinis Espresso Bar started in 1954 as an espresso bar with, reportedly, the first espresso machine in Melbourne. Twenty years later, two friends, Sisto Malaspina and Nino Pangrazio, bought it over and continued the tradition, keeping the same menu and decor. Pellegrinis is a Melbourne institution. The iconic espresso bar serves authentic Italian food and, of course, fantastic coffee. I first discovered it when my son was studying there. It was the favourite for hungry students and it wouldnt be uncommon to be invited by the owners to share enormous bowls of spaghetti with tomato sauce or lasagna drooling with cheese. Pellegrinis is like stepping back in time and a must if you want to breathe and understand the history of Italians in the city. The Apple Strudel is to die for. The cafe is now listed by the National Trust of Australia.Attica's brilliantly thought-out 17-course tasting menu is worth every penny Image: Karen AnandDinner at AtticaIts best not to say too much about the award-winning, much-talked-about, hard-to-get-into Attica. Ben Shewry has been making waves on the Australian eating-out scene for several years now. Attica was recently awarded number 20 in the world on the prestigious Worlds 50 Best Restaurants list (prepared by the UK media company William Reed Business Media).My expectations were high as I took a taxi on the 40-minute journey from central Melbourne to an eastern suburb called Ripponlea to eat at one of the most-sought-after restaurants in Australia.There is a three-month waiting list to get a reservation and I arrived promptly at 6.30pm. I was squeezed in after much persuasion. Mindfully sourced, Australian flavours and produce (marron, finger lime, kangaroo and abalone), skilful cooking and a lot of intellect goes behind his food. Ben Shewry spending more than half an hour chatting with me appeared shocking when one considers the evening he had ahead of him. It is a brilliantly thought-out 17-course tasting menu only and at Aus $295 without wine is worth every penny.Cruffins at Lune Croissanterie, a current rage Image: Karen AnandLune CroissanterieTaking the city by storm is Lune Croissanterie in the old neighbourhood of Fitzroy. Their new branch, right opposite Grand Hyatt on Collins Street, is testament to their ever-growing queues. This is an Australian version of the famous French croissant in many new avatars. Although they claim their plain croissant is the bestseller, you must gorge on the Lemon Curd Cruffin  a cross between a croissant and a muffin, almond croissant  and their savoury Ham and Gruyere. A great way to start the day!Mosaic floors and an arched glass skylight at 19th century Block Arcade Source: Karen AnandBlock and Royal ArcadesThe opulent 19th century Block Arcade with the iconic Hopetoun Tea Room and the Royal Arcade with a great little chocolate shop called Koko Black complete my shopping experience in the city. The Block Arcade, part of the Golden Mile heritage walk, is blessed with original stained glass windows, mosaic floors and an arched glass skylight. There are a number of independent Aussie retailers, including Creswick Woollen Mills, Alpaca Collection and Beechworth Honey. Similar in style is Royal Arcade, the oldest arcade in Australia. While youre shopping, check out Gaunts Clock, where mythical figures Gog and Magog ring the chimes every hour.The iconic Hopetoun Tea Room Source: Karen AnandAesop body careI was introduced to this local bath, body and skin care brand when I first visited Melbourne almost 20 years ago. I am so happy that it not only survives, its thriving and has several branches in the city and all over Australia. The brands shops look like Victorian apothecaries with modern design and functional brown bottles. Its like a thinking, 21st century version of the Body Shop. Products I buy there include the geranium leaf body balm and hydrating body treatment oil, hand creams and hydrating cream for stressed skin. The products are made from natural botanicals, so they are safe and pure and smell delicious. Ingredients are all declared on the packaging, unlike a lot of expensive cosmetic brands, and the staff is very well informed. By the way, its all reasonably priced.A collection of Australian and imported cheese presided over by Victor Persinette Source: Karen AnandSpring Street GrocerThe deli and the juice bar here is a great place to buy and see gourmet products. I also discovered a little secret air-conditioned cheese shop and tasting room downstairs, which has an amazing collection of Australian and imported cheese presided over by Victor Persinette.Karen Anand is a culinary consultant, food writer and entrepreneur.

5ce56975e8e3fc56af40be11,Waiter  there’s bacteria in my salad!,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/waiter-theres-bacteria-in-my-salad/article25793741.ece,2018-12-21,,The Hindu,"Heres some unpalatable news. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are hiding in your food, not just in the meat, and fish, but also in your tomatoes and apples. Thats right. Samples of raw food lifted across Chennai have tested positive for colistin-resistant bacteria, conforming to a global trend.A paper in the Journal of Global Antimicrobial Resistance by a group of researchers from Apollo Cancer Hospital, Chennai, and Christian Medical College, Vellore, carried out the survey in one city alone, lifting samples from 22 locations  shops and homes  between October and November 2017; 46.4% of the samples were found to harbour the highly-resistant bacteria.Last resortLead author Abdul Ghafur, of Apollo Hospitals, said: In the practice of medicine, colistin is called holy water. Its the last resort for very sick patients. Colistin resistance is already a problem in clinical practice, now we have established food origins in India.Globally, there are many publications outlining the route of transmission of colistin resistance via the food chain. So, frankly, when we found the colistin-resistant bacteria in our samples, we were not surprised at all, Dr. Ghafur explained.While handling of produce could play a role, the main cause of contamination in fruits and vegetables is a spillover from the poultry industry. Colistin is used as a growth factor in poultry, and poultry litter is used as manure in agricultural fields.Eating such contaminated food every day will allow the resistant bacteria to invade the human gut, rendering the host resistant to the powerful antibiotic Colistin, in case he/or she were to develop an infection.Undoubtedly, cooking the food will kill the bacteria. But, meanwhile, the food has already contaminated the surface in the kitchen, and people who handle the food have also been exposed, researchers said.Colistin is used extensively as a growth promoter and India has no regulations to prevent this practice, though many European countries have banned the use of colistin in poultry, the paper says. The Chennai Declaration of medical societies in India and National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance plan have made recommendations to ban the use of antibiotics as growth promoters."

The entrance which was turned into a dumping spot years ago, continues to overflow with waste every day. Not a thing has changed about the facade of the market except that more stakeholders dump garbage here now, says S. Saravanan, a vendor.Thayir Market, as it is referred to by the public, is at least 60 years old, say the vendors. What first started off as a fish market later saw the sale of fruits, dairy items and later vegetables.It is one of Madurais oldest markets, Mr. Saravanan says, and there is history in each of its corners. Currently, there are 152 shops at the market selling a variety of vegetables. This centrally located market also falls under the area of development zone of the Smart City Mission. A number of issues plagues the market and its surrounding areas, says S. Deepalakshmi, a tomato vendor.At least 100 trucks frequent East Marret Street to deliver a variety of items to the vegetable market and to the wholesale markets nearby. This creates extensive traffic in the area and leads to commotion as there is no proper pedestrian crossing. The quality of roads is poor too, she adds.R. Annapechi, who has sold vegetables at the market for 40 years now, says though the market now has asbestos sheet instead of thatched roofs, the smell of piling garbage has worsened with time.I cannot eat or sit in my shop because of the hideous smell. Some say they get used to the smell with time, but I have not. The market is in its worst condition during monsoon time, she adds. We can now see pelts and waste parts of slaughtered goats dumped into the bins. The hotels nearby also throw their waste here, she says. What began as one bin has now become three, says K. Ammaiappan, a functionary of Centre of Indian Trade Unions and a vegetable vendorMs. Deepalakshmi says there are no proper toilet facilities for women inside the market. The toilet inside the market complex is dysfunctional, she adds.The vendors also say the composting bins kept by the Corporation inside the premises have not been useful. Mr. Saravanan and P. Kaniraja, both functionaries of the CITU, say it was used only for one week by vendors. No crackdown was conducted on its usage after the initial enthusiasm expressed by the civic body in 2017, they add.Corporation Commissioner S. Aneesh Sekhar says the civic body was planning to instal 10 underground bins as part of the Smart City Mission plan.Thayir Market has been chosen as one of the locations, he adds."

In all, 27 crows and a mynah died after they were suspected to have had the poison-laced food.MM Hills wildlife forest officials sent four bird samples to the college to ascertain the cause of death. Forensic Science Laboratory authorities said monocrotophos is the cause of human deaths, but they were yet to ascertain that of the bird deaths.A forest officer said a team of 30 members combed the area in the temple's vicinity to check if more birds or animals had died, but they didnt find any.Opposition leader in the assembly, BS Yeddyurappa, said the temple should be brought under the muzrai department. In the legislative council, health minister Shivanand Patil admitted that district hospitals do not have enough ventilators. Norms stipulate at least four ventilators in a district hospital, and he promised to sanction more for districts.Since the casualties were many, ventilators werent enough. Therefore, officials decided to rush patients to Mysuru. After providing treatment to the needy, 80 ventilators were still on standby, he added."

Those rescued had been brought to the plantation in Dudda hobli, and been forced to work in extremely poor conditions. The rescued labourers were subsequently housed in a school nearby on Monday morning.The plight of the labourers came to light after one labourer, 50, a native of Chikkamagaluru went missing from his home. His son initially filed a complaint in Chikkamagaluru,before lodging one at the Banavara police station, where he had relatives, seeking assistance in tracing his father. While the cops went on the 50-year-old mans trail, the son started searching for his father in parallel. At Arasikere junction, a few miscreants allegedly tried capturing him, but he evaded them and lodged a complaint at the Dudda police station.Acting on this information, a team of police officers led by superintendent of police (SP) Prakash Gowda raided the plantation in Savanthahalli around 10pm on Sunday. While 32 men and 16 women were forced into labour, cops also found four children, belonging to some of these labourers in the sheds.Police said that the plantation was owned by Krishnegowda, a resident of Bengaluru, who had leased it out to Mounesh aka Murali. Along with his associates Basvaraj, Pradeep and Nagraj, Mounesh allegedly lured those looking for jobs across the state on the promise of high wages, but turning them into bonded labourers later.Police said that some of the people in the plantation had been working as bonded labourers for the past three or four years. Those running the farm allegedly restricted the movement of the labourers inside the farm, and housed them in temporary sheds, besides subjecting them to torture . The labourers were also taken to other farms in Nittur, Gandasi, Chikkamagaluru and Sakleshpura, where they were made to plough, plant, harvest and spray pesticides, police said.One of the rescued labourers, Vijay, a native of Chikkamagaluru, explained how the accused trapped helpless individuals such as himself. They wait near the Arasikere Railway Junction, and approach daily wage labourers like myself, promising us wages of up to Rs 500 per day and three free meals for loading tomatoes on to trucks. Once we are hauled into vehicles, we are brought to the plantation and confined here, Vijay said.Recalling the harrowing ordeal, another victim Ramesh said that the labourers would be beaten with iron rods when they demanded wages. Ratnamma, a native of Haveri district, said that the children, all of whom were aged below 12 were fed once in the morning. I returned to the shed only at 9pm, when I would cook their dinner and feed them. They would be given nothing in the interim period, said Ratnamma.The rescued labourers are being housed at the Morarji Desai School in MD Hosur. They will be sent back to their respective homes after a medical checkup camp is held under the supervision of officials of the public works department, police said.SP Gowda said that they had arrested Mounesh, and seized five of his vehicles including a tractor and bike. We are also looking for the others involved in the crime, who eluded us when we carried out the raid, said Gowda.- (By Darshan BH)"

With the deadline fast approaching, the demand for alternatives for these pollutants is on the rise. We speak to a few entrepreneurs who have beenproviding alternatives to disposable plastic...It is said that plastic toothbrushes can turn extremely toxic when they start decaying after centuries. So, why leave more carbon print in the over- polluted earth, asks G Venkateswaran of Nature Village, Erode. Our toothbrushes are made of bamboo and the bristles are made of corn fibre or charcoal. We believe in living in harmony with nature. We provide organic cotton, non-violent silk and natural dyes obtained from fruits, seeds and flowers and roots. Some of the interesting additions are fibre seats, seat pads, pillows, banana fibre, clay water bottles, bamboo key chains, bamboo straws, bamboo sets and bamboo shaving razor. He adds, The car seat pad and pillows are filled with banana fibre yarns, pure cotton and vettiver. They are covered with cotton cloth and non-hazardous ink. We have cotton sanitary pads and diapers, organic liquids and cloth wash as well. Though the awareness among people is still low, its gradually increasing, especially among youngsters.Marutham foods and Natural Products from Palani offers bio-degradable plates, bowls, trays and lid, made of sustainable natural resources including corn starch. They are sturdy and suitable for hot, wet and even oily food. They are fit to be used in microwave oven or kept inside the refrigerator. They degrade in a short period and are fully compostable. The important fact is that they do not impact the colour, odour or taste of the food. They do not leave any chemical residue, says one of its representatives.When you step out of home next time, dont forget to carry a bio-degradable bag. Ecofora of Regeno Ventures has come out with bio-degradable bags, primarily made of tapioca starch and natural additives. These bags are hundred per cent plastic free and can be recycled after use. We have different varieties of bags  seat covers, shopping bags, carry bags, medical bags and garbage bags. They decompose in 150 days, do not leave toxic residue and are eco-friendly. They are also dissolvable in high temperature. The polythene bag, on the other hand, remains in the landfill for more than 500 years, says R Soundharya, distributor in the Coimbatore region.Tucked away at a residential colony in Saibaba Colony, Coimbatore is Eco Green Unit, which delves into the concept of creating wealth from waste. Discarded banana fibre, coconut shells, areca palm leaves and kora grass have been given a new lease of life by converting them into spoons, plates, glasses, boxes, trays, yoga mats, floor mats, soap trays and pots. Some of these products are not only bio-degradable, but can also be converted into manure. Its founder SK Babu says, Our unit is located at Madhampatti village, near Siruvani in Coimbatore. We provide training in making areca leaf products, mat weaving, coir pot making and paper bag making. Eco plates and cutlery are healthy and hygienic and are great alternatives to plastics. They are biodegradable and eco-friendly. The pots made of coir can be used in gardening, landscaping and water conservation.Its time to go eco-friendly with stationery at work. Coimbatore-based Papcil has come out with pencils made of recycled paper. We source our raw material from factories and churn out pencils from them. The highlight, however, is the seed pencil. A seed is placed inside a gelatin capsule attached to the pencil. We have seeds of 13 varieties that comprise vegetables like tomatoes and chillies and flowers like marigold. Since the seeds do not last long when kept inside a gelatin capsule, we cover it with coir pith. This can last up to six months. After using the pencil, all you need to do is throw the seed into the soil and water it, says Gowtham Prasath, its founder.Disposable diapers and sanitary napkins take many years to decompose and remain in the landfills for a long time. Thats why Pollachi-based Dhivya Sidharth introduced reusable cloth diapers called KiddieHug. Cloth diapers are water-proof, leak-free, chemical-free, easy to use and one size (customisable for kids weighing 4-17kg). The reusable cloth diapers can be used from birth until the kids get potty trained. These diapers come in attractive colours and the babies need not wear anything over it. They are made from natural fibres like hemp cotton and bamboo cotton. Instead of disposing the diaper after single use, one can wash and reuse it. Mano Sathya Selvaraj, who has her own brand of cloth diapers called Apple Blossoms, says that cloth diapers are not just easy on the environment, but on the baby and wallet as well. She says, Bamboo cotton absorbs water easily. Our diapers come in two sizes  newborn and one size. We provide inserts with microfibre, hemp, charcoal bamboo and bamboo cotton. The diaper wet-free bags can be used to hold soiled and unuseddiapers."

So, if you dont like what you hear from me and if you have rotten eggs and tomatoes, please raise your hand!The green checkered gamchha (a coarse cotton towel) that he wears like a badge of pride today has been a significant part of this 68-year-old man  be it as a teenager sleeping rough at railway platforms, using it to fling bricks at adversaries during the Naxalite movement in the 70s, or to wipe his sweat as a rickshaw-puller ferrying people around south Kolkata. It is a part of my identity. I may be among tie wearers, but the gamchha keeps me rooted, helps me represent the class I belong and still trying to belong and survive.Byapari made quite an impression with anecdotes spanning his days as a child of Bangladeshi immigrants living in camps; as a rebel thrown into prison that he calls university because that is where I learnt to read and write with a stick on the ground and which sheltered me from the fear of being run over by cars or dying due to a lack of access to medicines; and his providential encounter with the late writer Mahasweta Devi , who discovered and shaped the firebrand author that Byapari is today.Although a staunch atheist, Byapari believes it was his fate that turned his life around when the lady passenger he was ferrying on his rickshaw was intrigued by his quest for the meaning of the Bengali word jijibisha. Will to live, she explained, before scribbling her name and address on a piece of paper that read Mahashweta Devi, who went on to publish his writings in her journal Bartika.Today, Byapari, who has authored close to a dozen novels and over a hundred short stories, and has been given awards for his work, lives on the southernmost fringes of Kolkata, where he cooks midday meals for students of the Helen Keller Badhir Vidyalaya for the deaf and the blind every day, unless he is advocating for Dalit rights or hopping Litfests.Im grateful for where I am today. But theres one thing that saddens me. Im invited to events where I get to choose from 150 kinds of roti, and a days rate for my hotel room is more than what I can afford to pay as house rent for a month. If people spared a thought for the condition people like me live in for the rest of our 364 days, it would make my writings, and days spent in jail, worth it! he signed off."

The scheme is implemented by the Union Food Processing Ministry, that has a corpus of Rs. 500 crore and aims to aid farmers in times of price fluctuation in tomatoes, onions and potatoes. The State is considering seeking transport subsidy for onion growers to sell especially stored onions in consuming States and working on ex-gratia grant to compensate affected growers.Onion prices have come under pressure because of the arrival of stored onions as well as fresh kharif crop. The wholesale price for stored onions is lower owing to poor quality, while the kharif crop is fetching around Rs. 10 per kg, as per official data.In November, 50% of the onion that arrived in wholesale mandis in the State comprised stored onions. The price quoted was between Rs. 3.50 and Rs. 4 per kg, which has created unrest among farmers, a source said.There is higher quantity of stored onions in the State as farmers had increased area under the crop during the 2017-18 rabi season in anticipation of better prices, the source said."

A camera focusing on the kitchen, where the tomato bath that was served as prasadam to the devotees was prepared, is also dysfunctional, much to the cops chagrin.Police pointed out that the temple premises are mostly uninhabited in the evening, and as evidence of the tragedy having been an act of sabotage mounts, cops said that miscreants may have been up to some mischief at that time. Had this been a case of just food poisoning, we would not have seen the effects as immediately, nor would they have been so severe. In this case, reaction to the prasadam was immediate. All those who had the tomato bath were seen writhing in pain near the kitchen, a police official said.Shankar, one of the priests at the temple, said that nearly 15kg of rice was used to prepare the tomato bath, which was to be distributed among them and the devotees. It was for a special occasion since the foundation stone was laid to build the temples gopuram . But, some devotees arrived early, and we served them food, deciding to eat the same at a later time. But fate had something else planned, said Shankar.Chamarajanagar superintendent of police Dharmendra Kumar Meena told STOI that a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder had been registered against thus far unknown miscreants.

The cool weather and all this love and happiness around calls for some warm, cosy food. For me, its all about hearty one-pot hot dishes for the family to share.I love the flavours from the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern kitchens  simple, fresh ingredients cooked with bags of flavour. My culinary philosophy emphasises on cooking with local seasonal produce. There are beautiful pumpkins, carrots, oranges and greens in the market these days and there are so many innovative ways to prepare them. Roasting vegetables and meat in the oven is a great way to cook as you dont have to keep hovering around the stove. Also, the nutritional value remains intact and you get a lovely smokey-charred flavour.Here are some of my current favourite Mediterranean winter dishes that you must try making soon. They are vegetarian but you could add some grilled chicken or fish to them. Alternatively, enjoy them as an accompaniment to your meat or seafood dish.Roast Pumpkin, saffron and orange soupA boring pumpkin soup gets transformed into an orchestra of flavours.Ingredients: 2tbsp olive oil, one onion (cut in wedges), 500g pumpkin (cut in wedges), 1tbsp chilli/sriracha sauce, 5-6 saffron strands, zest of one orange, 500ml (or more) water,  cup coconut milk (or cream), salt and freshly-cracked pepper,  cup pumpkin seeds (toasted), chilli flakes, 2tsp honey/date syrup, fresh coriander/parsleyMethod:Preheat the oven to 220 degrees Celsius.

I ran my hand along the leg and found that there was a very tender lump. There is agonising pain whenever I touch it.This is probably a trigger point  an area where the muscles and nerves have tangled up. It needs to be released. You can do this yourself by massaging it with your thumb. You can also apply ice for 10 minutes, rubbing it in a circular motion. You can use a foam roller to massage out the pain.You can go to a physical therapist who will use a non-invasive device like an ultrasound to remove the trigger. Triggers tend to reform. Stretch the muscles regularly to prevent this.Diet woesI am overweight and feel guilty about it. I diet and exercise. I do manage to lose some weight, only to regain it all and then some more.When you diet and starve your body of calories, the brain signals that you are hungry. Immediately, you crave simple carbohydrate snacks, sweets and chocolates. The blood sugar level spikes and you feel satiated. Unfortunately the tendency is to do this repeatedly at ever shorter intervals. That contributes to the weight gain.You could eat a fruit, a carrot or a raw tomato if you are hungry and steer clear of the carbohydrates. That way your hunger pangs may be temporarily satisfied.How much exercise?I am 60 years old and I retired a few months ago. I walk 30 minutes a day. Is that enough?It is good that you are walking. Try to reach your target heart rate. This is calculated as 80 per cent of 220 minus age. Muscles tend to waste as you grow older, so you also need to do weight training at least three times a week using light weights (2-kilo dumbbells). Stretches and yoga prevent stiffness brought on by increasing age. If you do all this, your balance will remain good, muscle and bones will be healthy and falls will be prevented.Stubborn babyMy one-month-old baby refuses to feed at my wifes breast. Should we start bottle feeds?Babies have a rooting reflex. If you touch the side of the cheek with the nipple or the tip of your finger, the baby turns its head and latches on. If you try to force the nipple into the mouth, the baby will reject it.Avoid beansI feel bloated, my stomach hurts, and I pass embarrassing amounts of gas.This may be due to your diet. You may be able to reduce it if you eat fewer beans and carbohydrates. Also, avoid aerated beverages. Drink plenty of plain water, at least three litres a day. Eat at least 2-3 fruits per day and cultivate regular bowel habits.Morning sicknessMy daughter is pregnant, and she vomits eight to 10 times a day. It is tough to watch.Vomiting during pregnancy may occur because of a urinary tract infection or for no reason. The obstetrician will be able to sort this out. There are a few simple manoeuvres to help. She could walk for a half hour morning and evening in the fresh air on level ground. She could leave the kitchen area when food is being fried. She could have acupressure performed on her wrists for 20 minutes every morning and evening. She could also give up food and eat only vanilla ice cream for a day. For some mysterious reason, it helps some women end vomiting. If all this fails then tablets may be required.The writer is a paediatrician with a family practice at Vellore and author of Staying Healthy in Modern India.

It has also started making puree from juicy vegetables like tomatoes and other local fruits like guava, banana and sapota (chickoo).Starting from mango pulp to dried chickoo and all types of frozen vegetables, the South Gujarat region has it all. All types of vegetables and fruits, including their variants, could form a rich export market for gulf countries, the US and UK, earning more than Rs 1,000 crore in the next five years. On the other hand, shrimp farming in South Gujarat has gained prominence over the last decade with export potential of more than Rs 900 crore. Majority of the shrimp export is done from Mumbai and South India ports.Aquaculture expert Dr Manoj Sharma told TOI, For fresh shrimp supply to Gulf countries, an international air cargo in Surat will be a blessing. However, the biggest boon will be on domestic front as we get more than 400 crore shrimp babies from Pondicherry via Vizag and Chennai. These shrimp babies arrive in Mumbai and then reach parts of Gujarat, including Surat and South Gujarat, via road.APMC, Surat, chairman Raman Jani told TOI, We have set-up the production plant with an intention to boost local farmers income and earning foreign exchange for the country. At present, not many farmers have APEDA licences, but they can go through us and still reap the benefit of exporting their products. We hope Surat international air cargo will go a very long way in establishing South Gujarat as a major agro product export market."

From chopping to deep frying, we tend to cook all the goodness out of food. There are, however, ways we can retain nutrition without compromising on taste. Heres how to go about it.Chop, chopThe usual process of preparing vegetables for cooking is to peel them all  even the ones that dont need it  cut them into small pieces and soak in water. This removes dust, grime, pesticides and added colours. It also removes about 40 per cent of vitamins B and C.Proper cleaning is absolutely essential to get rid of toxic substances, even if you lose some nutrition in the process, says skin specialist Dr Sanjay Ghosh. The added colours and pesticides are poisonous and can cause severe disorders. Dr Ghosh suggests that vegetables be washed thoroughly in running water or soaked before chopping so that the nutrition is not washed out along with pesticides. They should then be cut in large pieces and cooked quickly. Peeling vegetables is not necessary as peels have fibre and nutrition. These fibres are good for people with diabetes, high cholesterol and too many fat deposits, Dr Ghosh adds. Peel the vegetables thinly so that you can save some fibres and nutrition while getting rid of toxic chemicals.Smoking hotMost people cook in smoking hot oil but this process is incorrect. All cooking oils have a specific smoke point  the temperature at which oil molecules break apart and give off smoke. That is also when the beneficial fatty acids and vitamins go up in smoke and a host of harmful free radicals are produced. Free radicals cause inflammation that leads to high cholesterol, heart diseases, stroke, Alzheimers, cancer and many other disorders. Forget eating, even being exposed to this smoke while cooking is dangerous, especially for those who suffer from asthma and allergy.To protect yourself, heat the empty pan first. Then pour in oil, heat for a few more minutes and add the ingredients before the oil gives off smoke. Cover the pan and cook on low heat.Deep friedPuri, kachauri, pakoras, chops  Indian cooking has an array of deep fried dishes. Regular consumption of them may lead to obesity, which is linked to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, stroke and heart disease.Apart from free radicals, smoking hot oil also produces trans-fats, which raise the level of bad cholesterol and the risk of cerebral stroke. If you recycle oil used for frying, you create aldehyde, an extremely harmful organic substance that leads to a host of disorders including Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease. So should one throw away oil left over after deep frying? Well, it depends on the smoke point of the oil. Safflower, canola, mustard, sesame and coconut oil dont disintegrate at moderately high temperatures. If you fry at moderate heat  and not extremely high heat  then you can reuse them. Strain the oil once cool to get rid of burnt particles (harmful organic substances) and recycle. But if the oil looks turbid instead of clear, throw it away.Incidentally, coconut oil is one of those rare oils that has a high smoke point. This means you can safely use it for deep frying. Unfortunately, while popular in southern India, coconut oil is not accepted as a cooking medium in the rest of India.Choose shallow frying [like a paratha] over deep frying. This is not crispy but tastes good and the nutrition is preserved, says nutritionist Vijaya Agarwala. If you love crispy fries, get an air frier, she suggests.Cooking stylesNow lets talk about cooking procedures and how they affect nutrition.Boil: People think it is a healthy process even if the end product is bland. However, throwing away the water you boil in means losing 60 per cent of the nutrition of Vitamin B, Vitamin C and minerals. This is also true of rice. So boil things in just enough water and if there is any extra left, use it to make gravy.Also, let the water boil first and then put in the rice, lentils or veggies. Always cook on a low fire, with a lid on the pan. You can also use a pressure cooker to boil food in.Steam: This process of cooking retains the most nutrition. Vegetables such as tomato, carrot and broccoli become more nutritious when you steam them. If you saute the ingredients slightly and then steam them, the dish is tasty as well as healthy.Poach: Poaching helps retain the nutrition of an egg. You can also poach thin slices of fish and some vegetables (such as carrots and capsicum).Grill: You can grill vegetables, fish and meat but be careful not to char them. Any charred or blackened parts should be removed. Eating such parts can lead to cancer in the breast and pancreas as the process brings about harmful chemical changes in meat and chicken. Grill only the lean cut (low on fat) of meat or chicken.Saute: The easiest way is to cook in the saut mode on an induction cooker. You can even do it on low heat on a gas. Use olive oil for the best nutrition (especially anti-oxidants).Microwave: Extensive research has shown that cooking in the microwave retains nutritive value but can make food dry. Sprinkle some water on the food before reheating it to keep it moist. However, never use a plastic or melamine vessel to reheat food in the microwave oven."

Dried eucalyptus branches, which are burnt to crack the stone underneath, litter the hill. The entire hillock has been carved out, leaving just a small fort on top.Every night, 2 to 4 truckloads of stones are taken from the hill... the mining has been happening for decades by some influential people, said a villager.Over the years, quarrying has come to the edge of the fort. Now, blocks are removed from right under the fort. The fort wont last long, said the villager. The origin of the fort is unclear, with some historians believing that the structure could date back to the 17th century, where it was used as a defence post for the army. It is from this post, that they could get a view of the plains stretching till Bengaluru.However, there is no legislation to protect the structure.No recognition givenThe unprotected site is just one of the estimated 30,000 historical structures dotting the States landscape that has not been recognised under either the Central Acts governing the Archaeological Department or State laws for the State Archaeological Department.Experts believe a majority of these structures, like the Uddappanahalli fort, are under threat. Their fears were communicated to Tourism Department officials during a recent meeting on protecting such monuments.There has been no survey of unprotected monuments since 1942. Surveys do not cost much, and there are enough archaeologists and students who can do it.It needs to be done before we lose out on a lot of history. Weve already spoiled megalithic burial (10,000 to 30,000 years old) sites in most places of the states, said N.S. Rangaraju, a former Archaeology professor and a member of the Heritage Expert Committee.A few years ago, he and his students had taken up a pilot of three districts in south Karnataka. Over 550 unprotected structures were identified. These monuments are over 100 years old, and many of these are religious structures under the Muzrai Department, which does not have the expertise for conservation, he said.S.K. Aruni from Indian Council for Historical Research (ICHR) said a majority of these unprotected structures represent hundreds of years of village histories.There needs to be a micro-level documentation of history. But, it needs involvement from the people and the panchayat first. If they can get a preliminary document of the historical structures in the village, then researchers can build upon it, he said.There has been no survey of unprotected monuments since 1942.

5ce5df16e8e3fc56af40fa0a,A tale of two States,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-tale-of-two-states/article25694572.ece,2018-12-08,,The Hindu,"A few farmers sit huddled near a statue of Sardar Patel at Balaguda village in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh pouring out their woes over steaming cups of tea. The statue marks the entry point to the Patidar-dominated village.One of them, Manoj Patidar, who has just returned from the Mandsaur wholesale market, says that the goods and services tax (GST) and rising prices of diesel have made agriculture a loss-making activity. If the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government stays for another five years, we will have to sell our lands, says the tall farmer, his wry smile deepening the lines on his weather-worn face.In another place and State  in Rajasthan  separated by distance as well as priorities, Chhatar Singh Rathore of Tena village in Shergarh tehsil in Jodhpur district has a very different concern.He runs a roadside dhaba on National Highway 114, which connects Jodhpur to Jaisalmer. His main complaint concerns what he believes to be the wilful disregard of Rajput sentiment. Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, who is seeking a second consecutive term in office, he says, has humiliated Rajputs by not backing their opposition to the film Padmaavat , and also marginalising Manvendra Singh, son of former Union Minister Jaswant Singh, who is a Rajput.With not much farming visible in the entire region, caste is the primary marker of social identity, unlike in Madhya Pradesh, where locals display a clear sense of identity as farmers. The contrast between Mandsaur and Shergarh points to the differences between two worlds. While both are rural, one is agrarian and the other is dominated by an array of non-farm activities.On November 30, all eyes were on New Delhi where there was a massive protest by farmers who had gathered from all over the country in the thousands. Opposition leaders such as Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, and CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury spoke. This event came in the wake of another landmark protest held more than a year ago.In the middle of last year, farmers organisations had taken out a rally that touched Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, among other places. The participants also visited Mandsaur, where, a month earlier, five farmers had been killed in police firing. Weighed down by debts, the agitating farmers were demanding loan waivers.As politics heats up in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the Opposition sees farmer anger as having the potential to dent the prospects of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has performed well in most State elections held since it came to power in 2014. The reading is not far off the mark. The BJP scraped through in its stronghold of Gujarat in the 2017 Assembly elections, as a result of urban votes. The Congress, on the other hand, did well in rural Gujarat.However, one was able to get an idea of the situation while travelling through Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan over the last month. In a complex picture, the rural cannot always be conflated with the agrarian.Long list of woesMadhya Pradesh today presents a picture of rural discontent that is cementing an amorphous farmers identity  a sort of occupational consciousness  that the ruling BJP will have to be wary of in the future. But the same does not hold true in Rajasthan, where the rural sector is involved in an array of occupations  from stone mining and animal husbandry to forays into the hospitality sector through highway and city restaurants. There is nothing like a farmers identity across the vast, parched, swathes of Indias largest State by land area.It takes half an hour to reach Pipliya Mandi, the epicentre of last years farm unrest, on the road from Mandsaur to Neemuch town in Madhya Pradesh. Mukesh Patidar, a soyabean farmer in his mid-30s, has come to the mandi (wholesale market) to buy agricultural implements. My village, Chilot Pipliya, which is about 17-18 kilometres from here, saw one farmer become a shaheed (martyr) last year, he says. He adds that soybean farmers are a distressed lot, with a long list of grievances.If the fertilizer DAP (Diammonium Phosphate) cost Rs. 800-900 per 50 kg in 2013-14, it is now priced at Rs. 1,440 for 45 kg, he says. Potash, which was priced at Rs. 450 per 50 kg one-two years ago, now costs Rs. 900 kg, he adds.We use tractors to prepare our fields for the crop. They run on diesel, which has gone up from Rs. 50 a litre to around Rs. 70 a litre, Patidar says. And labour charges have also gone up from Rs. 150-200 to Rs. 300 a day now. Why will they work for less? They are getting grain at Rs. 1-2 a kg.He predicts that the BJP will lose votes in villages around Pipliya Mandi this time. Dilip Patidar, a farm activist who also runs a shop selling various agricultural goods, says the GST has made things difficult for farmers. He says, The GST on pesticide is 28% now. These were taxed at 0-4% earlier. Look at the motor that pumps water to fields. It was taxed at 6% earlier but attracts 12% GST now. The pipe to connect the motor to the fields attracted no tax earlier but attracts 12-18% GST now.All this has made farm inputs dearer. Of the entire area under soyabean cultivation in India, about half is in Madhya Pradesh, the soyabean State of India. The Malwa region, of which Mandsaur is a part, accounts for more than half of M.P.s cultivation of the kharif crop. Fields are prepared by tractor in the summer months. Renting is the norm for small and medium farmers and tractors are rented out for Rs. 700 per hour, up from Rs. 500 because of diesel price hikes. The cost of soyabean seeds, Dilip Patidar says, is Rs. 5,400 per quintal. Labour charges for sowing as well as harvesting have gone up, he adds.Electricity bills too have shot up. While it is possible to run a diesel engine instead of an electric motor to pump water into the fields, with diesel prices going up, it is becoming an expensive proposition now as with diesel becoming more expensive, with costs are Rs. 200 per hour.The soyabean produce is transported to the mandis (wholesale markets) in Pipliya Mandi, Mandsaur and Neemuch. Here again, transportation is more expensive because of the rise in diesel prices. The present minimum support price (MSP) for soyabean is Rs. 3,399 per quintal, but it sells in mandis at Rs. 2,800-3,100 per quintal.In 2013-14, the mandi prices had gone up to Rs. 4,500-5,000 per quintal, says Mukesh Patidar. He blames faulty export-import policies for the fall in prices.Mandi prices keep fluctuating on a demand-and-supply basis, and vary each day. Says a wholesale trader at the Mandsaur Mandi who refuses to be identified, These are like the stock market. It is partly the luck of the farmer and partly his ability to read trends that determine the price he gets for his produce.Look at onions. When prices begin to rise, they import these and the prices fall again, says Dilip Patidar.Indeed, the interests of farmers and consumers are at odds. When the prices of farm produce rise, the commissions of wholesale traders and other intermediaries in the supply chain push up the retail prices of farm produce. When prices fall, food price inflation ceases to be a problem but farmers face losses, rendering agriculture unprofitable as an occupation.For example, at the Ajmer vegetable wholesale market, tomatoes were selling at Rs. 8 a kg. On the previous two days, 1 kg was was selling at Rs. 10 and Rs. 12, respectively. Just 2 km away at the retail market, it was selling at Rs. 20.The dip in farm fortunes is visibly impacting the politics of Madhya Pradesh, a traditional BJP stronghold, with the Congress clawing back in the villages. The troubles of increased documentation, paperwork and bank payments,  seen by many as a part of the formalisation of the sector and cleaning up of the system  have also annoyed farmers.The M.P. government has put in place a subsidy scheme called Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (BBY), under which the government promises to plug the gap between market prices and the minimum support price (MSP). But to avail it, a farmer has to register himself at an authorised office and produce the required documents at the grain and vegetable market when he goes to sell his produce.Says Sunil Solanki, a farmer: Our soyabean crop gets a subsidy of Rs. 500 a quintal. But for this we have to submit a copy of our documents to the mandi merchant, who submits our farmer code numbers to the official market committee and then credits the money to our accounts, a process which takes between 10 and 15 days. The government subsidy under the BBY, he adds, takes two to three months to get credited to a farmers bank account. Unlike farmers elsewhere, farmers in M.P. are not paid in cash as everything is digitised.In other words, say several farmers, they pay in cash for labour, for renting tractors, and to transport the produce, but get paid by bank transfer. The time lag results in a cash crunch. They complain of long queues at markets and banks. Sensing this as an opportunity, Congress leaders have begun to promise cash payments to farmers if voted to power, according to local residents.Economist Utsa Patnaik says that the coming together of farmers across classes  the poor and the rich  was long overdue. She says: There has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. There has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation, and the displaced will be absorbed by industry. The experience of Europe was different. Rather than being absorbed in industry there, the displaced were exported to North America, Australia and South Africa, and they captured the resources there after subduing indigenous people. We dont have that option.She adds: The open trade policies have exposed farmers to the highs and lows of global prices, which they cannot withstand. The meaning of priority sector has also changed under the influence of neoliberal policies, and farmers are unable to access low-interest loans. They have to borrow from private lenders at high interest rates and end up in a debt trap. It is only now that people have begun to notice the farm unrest that was waiting to burst forth.Other sources of incomeFew farmers can be seen at the Ajmer wholesale vegetable market after 11 a.m. They come here at 3 a.m. and leave after selling their produce  in return for cash payments  by 9-10 a.m. The mandi lacks the scale of operations or the frenzied activity of, say, the Surat wholesale market or even Azadpur Mandi in Delhi.The reason is not hard to find. This correspondents journey through Rajasthan, across 2,100 km, covering Jaipur, Tonk, Ajmer, Sawai Madhopur, Nagaur, Pali and Jodhpur districts, showed farm activity present only in the villages close to Tonk.Rasoolpuri village, which has high Gujjar and Meena populations, has farmland where mustard is grown. Here, farmers complain about rising diesel and fertilizer prices and the limited supply of water, which is available only from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. The produce, they say, sells at Rs. 3,200 a quintal, much below the MSP of Rs. 4,200.Farmers at a tea stall just outside the village say they will vote for the Congress as they are fed up of having their concerns brushed aside.But most of rural Rajasthan is a very different world. Villages, even around Jaipur, for miles on end have hardly any farm activity. The better off among villagers have diversified into non-farm activities such as dairy and poultry, while the poor are into animal grazing or work as labourers in construction activities and other sectors.A 40-minute drive on the Jodhpur-Jaisalmer highway leads to the Balesar-Shergarh belt, an arid, sparsely populated area dotted with Rajput-dominated villages. A detour from the highway down a narrow, broken road reveals what substitutes for farming in this region: stone-mining for the construction sector is in full swing on both sides of the road.Meghlasia is a village with Meghwal (Scheduled Caste) and Rajpurohit families. The latter, who describe themselves as gurus of Rajputs, are Brahmins by caste.Stone-mining is a key source of income for the villagers. In addition, they also sow bajra (millet) after the first rains in June-July, but the yield is subject to the vagaries of the monsoon rains.Caste is the markerLike many other Rajputs who have opened restaurants or dhabas because there is not enough water for farming, Chhatar Singh Rathore of the Rajput-dominated Tena village too runs one on the road towards Jodhpur.Says Rathore, Many people in my village run restaurants on the highway. The richer Rajputs also own restaurants in Jodhpur. There are 10 restaurants in the city run by people from my village.He tries to summarise his villages sources of income: Our previous generation saw many people join the Indian Army. You will find many ex-servicemen here. This generation has taken to the restaurant-catering sector in a major way. That apart, many from the village have migrated to Surat to join the cloth industry where they specialise in designing and packing. Some even race horses in Dubai.The Rajput community in the State has gravitated towards the hospitality sector, with heritage hotels and havelis dotting the State. Many are owned by richer Rajput families. They have a traditional feel and visible Rajput markers such as photographs of men in traditional attire holding a sword or rifle. A lot of them try to attract foreign tourists.This non-farm rural world is in sharp contrast to that of M.P., where an occupational identity centred on farming is being forged. In Shergarh tehsil of Jodhpur, caste remains the prominent identity marker, with cultural issues occupying centrestage.Rathore is unhappy with the Rajasthan government for not standing behind Rajputs on the film Padmaavat . He complains that Vasundhara Raje got the entrance to the Raj Mahal Palace in Jaipur sealed to target former royal Diya Kumari, and also humiliated the family of BJP veteran Jaswant Singh.In Tibna village, about 90 km from Jodhpur, water supply poses an acute problem. Sarpanch Bhawani Singh Rathore points to a dry hand pump which is wrapped in a sack cloth. The village has houses placed wide apart, and is populated longitudinally, one house after another for a few kilometres. It has just 300 families, says the sarpanch, of which 150 are Rajput. Other than water, villagers also complain about the lack of school teachers in the local government school. However, despite their various frustrations, they do not think of themselves as aggrieved farmers. Caste remains the key marker of identity and status.You find three types of scenarios, says political analyst and author Sajjan Kumar. The first is Madhya Pradesh, where agriculture is linked to the market, with cash crops such as soyabean and cotton. Here, farming is under stress because of a fall in market prices and the impact of demonetisation. The second is seen in agrarian States such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (excluding western U.P.). Their agriculture is not linked to the market, with mainly food crops such as rice and wheat being produced. An arid State such as Rajasthan presents a third scenario, where agriculture is not central to rural life.He explains the significance of these diverse realities: An occupational identity, where people identify as farmers, is emerging in States of the first kind, such as M.P., Maharashtra and Gujarat. In States such as U.P. and Bihar, while agriculture is central to rural life, caste and religion remain dominant identity markers in the absence of strong market linkages of agriculture. In Rajasthan, in the near absence of agriculture as a key rural vocation, identity markers are still tied to caste.Rathores sentiments lend credence to this hypothesis. I have no problem with [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi. He says we should sell pakodas if we can and I have been doing so at my restaurant, he says. My problem is with Vasundhara Raje. Rajputs will try to ensure a victory for Manvendra Singh at Jhalrapatan. What is a Rajput without self-respect?There has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. There has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation.Utsa Patnaik,Economist"

Herds of elephants have started coming from the Bannarghatta National Park along the Cauvery North Wild Life Sanctuary. The onward movement of the herds will be seen in Hosur forest range along Thally, Jawalagiri, Noganur, Panai, Denkanikottai, Udedurgam and Sanamavu.In its wake, agricultural fields with paddy, corn, tomatoes, ragi, beans, carrots, and sugarcane on the fringes of the reserve forest will face the onslaught of the elephants.However, farmers are told not to venture out in the night to guard their fields. The government provides compensation for crop loss, and hence farmers are cautioned against risking their lives.The department has also warned the public from indulging in chasing the elephants on their own, creating havoc in the midst of the herd and dispersing the herd. Villages along the migratory route of the elephants have also been advised to alert the Forest Department on any sighting of elephants.

Though August and September witnessed a couple of spells of rain, the officials termed it as untimely.Telling effectWith decrease in the water table, the rabi season has its drawbacks, with the farmers unwilling to take up crops. As against the expectations of officials and farmers as well, the paddy yield turned dismal in about 30,000 hectares and the groundnut crop could survive in just 1,600 hectares, while it is set to perish in about 18,000 hectares.Agriculture Officer (Chittoor) G. Sujatha said that 2018 witnessed 42% deficit rainfall. She said this phenomenon had a telling effect on the overall agriculture scenario in the district.Though the district administration had cherished ambitious plans for the horticulture sector this year, the scenario had presented dismayed results with mango growers receiving a jolt due to delayed flowering and crop cutting. The district administration had to come to their rescue by arranging support price in coordination with the pulp industry.The deficit rainfall in Kuppam region has brought disappointment to the horticulture sector, adversely impacting the rose and grape gardens.The farmers said that unlike the previous years, this year saw prolonged dry spell till the second week of October, taking away the moisture in air.The sugarcane cultivation in the western mandals also took a beating. Though some farmers were persuaded to undertake natural farming to overcome the drought conditions, it was much delayed, and they could only think of the switch next season.The saving grace is that tomato growers in Madanapalle region escaped the wrath of drought by undertaking the cultivation in multiple phases. Much to their happiness, the groundwater table was not alarming till recently."

Read MoreDownload The Times of India News App for Latest CityAHMEDABAD: Our Sabarmati waters are laden with neurotoxic metals, even though municipal sewage and industrial effluent treatment plants claim to have treated the sewage. Its a serious threat to hundreds of farmers in 43 villages downstream of the Sabarmati who use waste waters for growing vegetables and crops.A recent study carried out by the Collaborative Regional Research Programme (CRRP) of the Asia Pacific Network (APN) and the discipline of earth sciences at IIT-Gandhinagar found that copper levels were 7 to 9 times higher than limits set by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). Nickel was found to be 2 to 5 times higher; iron, 4 to 5 times higher; selenium, 4 to 10 times higher; and chromium , 8 to 9 times higher.After the Gujarat government launched its Policy for Reuse of Treated Waste Water in May this year, many STPs across the state are being installed to provide farmers with treated waste water to grow food to meet water demands in stressed areas. A senior Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) official admitted that many of the STPs in the state are not capable of filtering out heavy metals. The ecology research laboratory of the department of botany of the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) had found that heavy metals from treated waste water used for agriculture found they way into vegetables  amaranthus, cabbage, spinach, okra, egg-plant and tomato. The research was carried out by R K Sharma and M Agarwal from BHU and F Marshall from SPRU Freeman Center, Sussex University, the UK.One of the origins of the heavy metal load in urban environment is waste water effluents, said IIT-Gn Professor Manish Kumar who is the lead principal investigator (PI) of the project along with IIT-Gn Scholars Bhagwana Ram, Subhash K Sharma, and Arbind Patel. Kumar went on to say: The extent of its accumulation depends usually on industries in the vicinity and the lack of awareness on unscientific dumping of wastes. One also requires a precise understanding of heavy metal absorption in soil, road dust, and sediment.Kumar said that unlike organic contaminants, heavy metals are non-biodegradable and tend to accumulate in living organisms. There are heavy metal ions that are known to be toxic or carcinogenic, Kumar said. Industrial effluents from tanneries, electroplating , dyeing, metallurgical and paint businesses, and other metal preparing and refining operations contain significant measures of metal particles."

Farmers also agreed that innovation is the key to the next level of reforms in production and income. The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Ropar, has put up on display many products, one of which was 'Smart integrated irrigation and energy management system'.Talking about this innovative system, Dr Vikrant Bhakar, from IIT Ropar, said, ""This product helps convert extra power from solar to AC through an inverter and the farmer can save up to 7,560 units of power per year, and earn a good amount of money, if he decides to sell this power.""The Institute has also displayed products for keeping fruits and vegetables fresh for two to three days; for peeling off peas; and Agri Marketing-App.""We are the technology partner for a project on 'Sustainable Food Supply Chain Systems and Water Management', being undertaken in collaboration with the University of Cambridge,"" Bhakar added. 'Innovation is Great' - so goes the tagline of the pavilion of the United Kingdom (UK).There are multiple companies which have brought along their innovative products in the streams of pre and post-harvest management. Nextek has developed a hydrogen-based film to increase the shelf-life of the agri-produce.Speaking of the product, Professor Edward Kosior, Managing Director, Nextek said, ""Our packaging has the capacity to reduce water loss and stop condensation, hence the life of the agri-products increases. We are undertaking this project in collaboration with India and ten companies from both the countries are engaged in research, development and testing.""Ardra Systems has displayed their soil sensors, which release water when required, saving the wastage of water. PBD Biotech has developed a revolutionary kit to identify bacteria in a cow's milk, which will work for disease prevention.Also, countries like Canada, China, Israel and Netherlands also have displayed many innovative products in grain storage management, biosystems, genetics, disease control.Khristein Water, co-founder of Sponnado, a Canada based company which has developed an air sampler says, ""these products cost Rs 16,000 and will give the farmer advance warning from one to two weeks that there is fungal infection in his crop be it potato, tomato and other crops and thus the farmer will be able to take remedial measures and spray accordingly. It will cover an area of 50 to 100 acres thus a group of farmers or village can buy this system. There is small device in this sampler which will collect the sample and that has to be send to the laboratory for testing and thus from the test one will be clear which kind of fungal infection,'' she says.Tech giant Microsoft also endeavors to make companies and farmers aware of their B2B solution which is a cloud-enabled 'Special Purpose Agri-specific Platform'.A representative of Microsoft shared that the app-based system will help the pharmaceutical companies, farm equipment companies, seed companies to gather information about the ground and weather conditions to send an advisory to the farmers about when to spray pesticides when to sow the seeds.""Research and testing is on for this product, and it will be made available globally by next year,"" he said.Pramod Rajan, Head - Research and Development, International Tractors Limited (Sonalika Group) said, ""For real ground-level adoption of technology, there needs to be a two-way communication between the business and the end-user. Just showcasing technology is never enough; it needs to be made available at the ground level."""

Many of the women workers are now taking up odd jobs and working as domestic helps. This will give them a better option, KSCDC chairman S.Jayamohan told The Hindu .Suphalam projectThe corporation will launch its own agricultural task force as an extension of Suphalam, its organic vegetable farming project inaugurated in September. The agriculture sector was severely hit by the floods leading to a steep fall in domestic vegetable production. Suphalam is one of the many projects introduced by the government to overcome the crisis, he said.At KSCDCs first vegetable farm in the State at Kottiyam, many crops are ready for harvest and some are available to the public at their outlet. We have spinach, eggplant, tomato, okra, green chilly, and beans at the factory along with banana and tapioca. The demand for organic vegetables is too high and we are developing a regular clientle as well. 300 workers were involved in farming in shifts and they were paid Rs. 3 lakh as remuneration. It guarantees more working days for the labourers, an income for the corporation and safe vegetables for the public. By December, all other factories will be part of Suphalam and the training too will start, he said.ObjectiveImplemented with the support of Kerala State Agency for the expansion of Cashew Cultivation, Horticorp, Agriculture Department and Haritha Mission, Suphalam aims to produce 100 tonnes of vegetables by March 2019 from the farms at various factories in the State.The corporation will also distribute MGNREGA job cards to all cashew workers so that their income is not blocked during the gaps when factories remain closed. Many of them are not card holders, so we will issue cards to them from December 6.Alternative vocationHe added the green task force was also part of attempts to find them alternative vocations, the only way of survival for the labourers in the crisis-stricken traditional sectors.We are slowly introducing them to other concepts so that their lives are not affected in the long run, he said."

He is hopeful of heading there next summer and immersing himself in the citys sustainable and inventive approach to food.The head chef at Mumbais Olive Bar & Kitchen is on a mission to change the way people consume food and if his new menu is anything to go by, its a change we welcome with open arms and loosened belts.Backyard goodiesIn November, the iconic Mediterranean fine-dine in Bandra, Olive, celebrated its 18th anniversary. On offer are a new cocktail, and food menu. Not many may know that the restaurant has its own back garden; it flooded in the monsoon but is now blooming. It is here that bar manager John Leese seeks herbs and inspiration for a cocktail menu that aims to highlight agave spirits. The Garden of Eden (Rs. 630) has gin shaken with a lychee puree, with lemongrass and ginger adding fragrance and heat. The drink starts out bitter and then mellows down to a smooth sweetness; with basil oil adding depth. Tommys Margherita (Rs. 750) has agave nectar and El Jimador Blanco tequila and a sharp drink with citrus notes.In-house creationsThe drinks are respectable but its Olives food that makes the strongest impression. Sachdeva believes in treating ingredients and produce with respect and showcasing them to the fullest. Theres emphasis on organic and locally sourced fare (from across India), and reduced wastage. Everything that cannot be sourced locally is made in-house, including bread, butter, sauces, spreads, ferments, pickles and sausages. Earlier we did a lot of fruit and vegetables ferments. Now, we are pushing the boundaries using grain and wheat and fish, says Sachdeva. Its easier and simpler this way; we dont want to rely on cans. It makes for food that is inventive and indulgent.Take the Tuna Jerky (Rs. 525), richer and more nuanced than any meat jerky. Sachdeva takes fresh, local tuna and smokes it slowly till it dries up and intensifies in flavour. The jerkys saltiness is softened by crushed potatoes and smoked ketchup. A Red Velvet Fried Chicken 2.0 (Rs. 525) dunks chicken in a batter of cake crumbs and buttermilk and fries it till golden and moist and dusts it with red velvet crumbs. Its finger lickin good. The no-waste Sweet Corn Gnocchi (Rs. 375) is a Sachdeva favourite. It uses every part of the corn: cob and kernels become a puree, kernels turn into gnocchi, husk is fermented and added to puree, and some of the husk is used to smoke the accompanying cabbage hearts. All the trimmings from the corn and other vegetables go into a vegetarian XO sauce, smoky on the tongue and caramel in colour.Comfort foodThose with a dairy turn of mind will be delighted with the cheese on offer, sourced from different farms across India and some made in-house. Homemade stringy cheese is stuffed in rice balls, drizzled with truffle oil and served as a Mushroom and Truffle Arancini (Rs. 375). Its crisp, gooey and earthy. The Baked Brie & Truffle (Rs. 450) is stunning  truffle brie is paired with mascarpone and heaps of parmesan shavings, served on house-made raisin bread. Its a mouthful of umami, warm and creamy brie playing with the slight sweetness of the crunchy bread. Its a dish that shows off technique, has locally sourced ingredients and it serves as delicate comfort food. Theres homemade ricotta, crumbly and heavy pairs with smoky roasted sweet potatoes (Rs. 395); stringy burrata with fresh, sweet tomatoes (Burrata and Heirloom Tomatoes, Rs. 395) and chilled goats cheese with fresh figs and quinoa (Figs and Goat Cheese, Rs. 395).To round-off the meal is the Vodka Milk Panna Cotta (Rs. 450). Vodka added to milk helps the resultant ice cream set on its own. This intense combination is offset by a plain vanilla panna cotta, a berry puree for some sourness, and apple granite (with cucumber juice); theres white chocolate too, but it makes the whole dish too heavy.The menu will see a few additions over the next few months. Sachdevas homemade duck sausage, which sold out in a week is curing; and a new batch is expected in December. A spoiled can of expensive anchovies eventually led him to can his own fish so now mackerel bones and heads are being cured to make an intense oil. Expect many such experiments in the future, asserts Sachdeva.Olive, Khar (W); phone: 43408229, open from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. (Monday to Sunday) and 12.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. (Saturday and Sunday)"

Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav led one such group from Bijwasan. Narmada Bachao Andolan activist Medha Patkar, All India Kisan Sabhas Hannan Mollah and others joined the protest that was held under the united banner of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee The march Thursday led to traffic snarls on 26km of city roads. We are saying sorry to people who have been troubled due to traffic snarls. We have distributed pamphlets among them to briefly explain the farmers distress, Yadav said.The pamphlets urged the people to join them when they march to the Parliament on Friday. Farmer groups also threatened to protest naked if stopped from reaching there.The pamphlets stated that farmers get only Rs 5 per kilo of tomato while consumers pay Rs 30. Our life is also cheap. In the last 20 years, over three lakh farmers have committed suicide, the pamphlet informed.The farmers said they demand the convening of the Parliament to pass two bills: one pertaining to one-time full loan waiver, the other for a long-term institutional measure to ensure farmers are not pushed into debt again. They also demand implementation of Swaminathan Commission recommendations that say the minimum support price should be fixed at 50% above the comprehensive cost of production.Yadav called the BJP government at the Centre the most anti-farmer government ever. The protest march is for the liberation of farmers from the spectre of suicides, from various forms of exploitation propagated by the state and from organised loot and plunder, he said.Anish Kumar from Delhi School of Social Work said there is a lack of political will to address the agrarian distress. We joined the protest to give strength to the voice of the farmers that has been raised at a crucial time ahead of next General Election. We want the policy-makers to listen to the voice, Kumar said.A group of students from Delhi University joined the protest march near Dhaula Kuan. The farmers claimed that in all marches students, artists, lawyers, doctors, etc, extended support.A musical evening mainly based on agrarian, rural and folk themes was organised at Ramlila Maidan where the farmers retired for the night.In Video: Delhi: Farmers gather in capital today to protest against centre"

Tell me chetta Folk singer Kovan and team sang with vigour in Tamil, as the black and yellow logo of Aarppo Aarthavam shone in the background. As the venue, the Vanchi Square in Kochi, swayed like Punnamada Lake to their tunes, the activists who launched the campaign welcomed each of the enthusiasts who trickled in to watch whats going on. Yes, we are trying to bust the discriminations and myths based on menstruation in our State, chechi. You may sit inside if you like, said one of the organisers to a curious inquiry from a middle-aged woman, and she blushed like a tomato.While the onlookers like her witnessed the proceedings with a question mark looming on their faces, the voices from inside the little tent at the venue were firm. Lawyer Maya Krishnan, one of the organisers of the event, said, India is a country that signed an international covenant, agreeing that it will campaign against the biases based on menstruation. But we saw how the people responded to the topic of womens entry to Sabarimala Temple, saying the people of the gender arent supposed to be in its premises as women menstruate. Its scary how even in our families, there is a discrimination against it and today, we launch a campaign aiming to wipe these out for good.The programme saw the participation of many progressive thinkers, ranging from social critics like Sreechithran, transgender people, women who had announced their plans to visit Sabarimala and more. While they were the invited guests, the audience included those like C P Srihari, a techie who came all the way to Kochi from Thiruvananthapuram to take part in the event. When such a movement happens, the least you can do is proclaim your support by giving it word of mouth publicity. I am someone who often speaks for equality of women in all forums possible and taking part in such a programme would help me speak for it better, even if it is at a gathering of friends, Srihari says.Social critic Sreechithran M J, who also took part in the event, said its time we spoke out loud for those like the little girl who recently lost her life in Tamil Nadu while being forced to stay outside her house during cyclone Gaja because she was menstruating for the first time. Yes, there might be many people, including women, who speak in favour of the discrimination on our streets these days, but we are standing up for those many women who lost their lives, face unjust treatment and lead miserable lives for this natural, biological process, he says, alongside his mom and activist Jayashree.The organisers say that the programme at the Vanchi square is a launch pad for a detailed campaign to create awareness about menstruation. From school to school, college to college and family to family, we have charted out an initiative to do whats needed to cleanse this bias. Enough is enough, says Maya.In Video: Aarppo Aarthavam: Not letting discrimination thrive. Period."

Rajagopal was elated when his daughter R. Jayavarshini told him she was keen on pursuing farming  an avocation that ran in the family  despite having completed an engineering course. The father-daughter duo underwent training at a poly greenhouse plantation in Hosur and began cultivating crops at Rajappan Chavadi near Needamangalam.But their hopes came crashing down as Cyclone Gaja struck. She did not want to take up any other job, and I started the plantation in her name. The yield was very good and encouraging. But Cyclone Gaja turned everything upside down as our greenhouse plantations were completely destroyed, said Mr. Rajagopal, whose plantation was, notably, inaugurated by the District Collector.He had set up three units, covering 25 cents each. Each unit had cost over Rs. 9 lakh for the greenhouse and an additional Rs. 2 lakh for the installation of a drip irrigation system. The government subsidy is limited to one acre, which means the unit would get only Rs. 4.5 lakh as against the Rs. 9 lakh spent on building it.I had a structure capable of withstanding wind speeds of up to 120 km per hour. The destruction [caused by Gaja] shows that the wind speed [during the cyclone] was much higher, said S. Jeethaman Krishna, who took up agriculture after completing an MBA from the University of Wales.We are a family of agriculturists, and I opted for horticulture in Tiruvarur  the rice bowl. I established the plantation in 2013, said Mr. Krishna, who cultivated cucumber, tomato and coriander as an intercrop. He said a unit could produce 20 tonnes of vegetables and bring revenue of Rs. 15 lakh per annum.When asked whether he would be able to use his plantation again, Mr. Krishna said he would have to start from scratch, as the wind had shaken the foundation of the structure. The absence of an insurance scheme was a major problem, he added."

The 31-year-old guy from Delhi recently added another feather on his cap (read: chefs hat) when he appeared as a guest judge on one of the episodes of MasterChef Australia, on the popular shows 10th anniversary special season, in which the contestants had to recreate his famous butter chicken for an elimination round.In a telephonic chat with us, Saransh spoke about his MasterChef experience, future plans and a possible Goila Butter Chicken restaurant in Calcutta.You are globally known for your Goila Butter Chicken. Whats the secret that makes it different from butter chicken served elsewhere?Its actually a home recipe. I used to cook it for my parents when I was much younger. They used to always complain that as vegetarians, they got to eat a much more shoddy version of butter chicken, which is paneer butter masala. And that would always be too creamy and too sweet. When I went to my culinary school, I figured out a recipe where I would smoke it with coal and serve it to them. So basically, it would be more robust and smoky. Thats how I ended up infusing smoke into a traditional butter chicken gravy.I also reduced the amount of fat and dairy that goes into the dish  basically cream and butter  so the tartness of tomato shines out. Since we infuse smoke using coal  a more traditional technique  it makes the dish a little different. So Goila Butter Chicken is lighter, home-style and guilt-free; something that a millennial would eat. The dish is more in sync with today. Its not modern in its presentation but in its flavour profile.What is your earliest memory of having butter chicken?I am not someone who grew up eating butter chicken. The first butter chicken I ate was in my college, IHM, Aurangabad. My trainer was an ex-ITC chef and he had a very good recipe for the dish. That was my first taste of butter chicken  creamy, very refined, smooth with lots of flavours. Then when I went back to Delhi and tried the local butter chicken that people like, it was very different than what my trainer had made me try. What I realised was that people would actually savour the extra creamy, buttery and bright orange version of the recipe.Its interesting that despite being a vegetarian for most part of your life, you are known for a chicken dish. Wasnt it difficult to understand the flavours and innovate on a dish which you had never had until you were in college?When I was first put into the butchery section in college, I went with a professional approach since I didnt have any option. I didnt know how meat tastes, how its cooked. I feel cooking is a balance between passion and technique.Your personal favourite when it comes to butter chicken apart from your own?Its actually from a restaurant in Delhis Ashok Vihar called Invitation. For me, thats the best butter chicken I have ever had.How did your restaurant come about?I always thought I would open a fine-dining restaurant. I never thought I would end up opening a QSR which is centred around butter chicken! It occurred to me only after I started doing TV shows that we, as chefs, look at food as a luxury but when you travel across India you realise that its first a necessity. So this is when it came to my mind to test it out as a venture since I already had a popular recipe. So June 2016 is when I opened Goila Butter Chicken in Bombay.Whats next for Goila Butter Chicken?We are looking at expanding to different parts of the country. Right now its just Bombay but we are looking to expand to cities like Bangalore, Calcutta, Delhi and Gurgaon.You have been a contestant yourself on Food Food Maha Challenge (a reality show on Food Food) which you ended up winning too (2011). How was it like being a guest judge on a show like MasterChef Australia?Life has come full circle for me. When you find fame through a reality show, it becomes much more challenging because theres fame to deal with. Suddenly people start doubting your capability as a restaurant chef because they feel you are more of a TV person. So there has to be a balance. You have to keep honing your skills.I feel satisfied with the fact that I got an opportunity through winning a reality show. I was very, very happy that MasterChef got me on board not only because of my popularity but because of my product. That makes me feel very proud. I was just out of college when I had started watching MasterChef and I always used to dream of being on the show. And to be there as a guest judge, getting so much respect, makes you feel great.The set is beautiful, its a permanent structure that has been stationed there for 10 years. They are very professional and honest in their approach towards the show. No wonder MasterChef Australia is the most popular MasterChef franchise across the globe. Theres a soul to the show.Saransh Goila (centre) with (from left) Gary Mehigan, Matt Preston and George Calombaris on the sets of MasterChef Australia. Source: TwitterTell us some of the fun things that happened behind the scenes on the set...When I met Matt (Preston) on the set, he was talking about his trip to India. He is such a great orator that when he was talking about Hyderabadi Biryani, just the way he was describing it made me feel like having it right then and there. He is a fun person and also very particular about his costumes. I had done a pop-up at chef Georges (Calombaris) restaurant, as a part of the Melbourne Food & Wine Festival in the same month when we were filming MasterChef. He loves to party, engage with young people and promote them. I owe this opportunity to him.George is full of life, energetic. Matt is probably a romantic and an intellectual and Gary is down to earth, likeable and honest. He loves India, be it the food, spices, people he spends three months a year in India now. As an Indian, you would relate to him the most, he is very warm.Your name is in the Limca Book of Records for the longest road journey by a chef. What is your takeaway from it?If I had to break down India into different cuisines, there are so many communities, the cuisine is so diverse every 200km the flavour, food, spice blend, ingredients change. I was very fascinated with the North-east in fact  lots of fermentation, different cooking techniques. Nagaland was an amazing state to be in and experience the tribal cuisine; even Assam was interesting.In the south, I found Andhra cuisine to be quite interesting their pickles are amazing. I discovered gondhoraj lebu in Calcutta. I discovered many such ingredients and realised it would probably take a lifetime if I had to discover everything in our country.Any particular region that stood out?It would definitely be Nagaland. In fact, I did a special at my restaurant  Black Sesame Pork, which was there for three months.Globally, do you think the stereotypes about Indian food has somewhat started breaking or do they still exist?The stereotypes are definitely breaking. There are many international restaurants who are presenting India in a very different format. Be it Gaggan (Anand) in Bangkok or chef Garima (Arora) who became the first Indian woman to get a Michelin star. People have started to realise that Indian food isnt just about curry-driven gravy, its much more than that. Its balanced, theres so much history, influence of Ayurveda this is the time for Indian food to reposition itself.A TV show host, writer and a chef, which role do you like playing the most?The profile that works for me the most is that of a chef traveller. I like to travel within India and share with the world what our country has to offer. Thats something that gives me the most satisfaction.What will we see you doing next?Sadak Chef is something I am working on at the moment. The show (for a digital platform) promotes street chefs who have created amazing dishes but have never got their due. I will be travelling across the country. I am working on a couple of other shows as well; an international one too which we are doing with a big channel in Singapore. I am looking to be more global, trying and selling Indian food across the globe. Thats where I am headed with all my content and activities that I am doing in 2019.QUICK SIXChefs you look up to: I closely follow David Chang. Then theres Jamie Oliver; Anthony Bourdain was someone I used to take inspiration from. Back home theres Sanjeev Kapoor; I used to dedicatedly watch his shows. Now he is a friend and mentor. He will always be someone I look up to.An ingredient you are loving right now: Jackfruit, green garlic. But over all, its mushrooms.A dominant food trend right now: Looking within, going regional when it comes to Indian food. Just getting back the classics and presenting them in a more acceptable format. Theres so much sustainable farming happening, people are now talking about what is available in our country.Your fave cuisine: Indian. Difficult to choose which part of India though.Your earliest memory of cooking: When I made aloo paratha as a kid with the help of my uncle.Your biggest culinary influence: My grandfather. Though, while growing up, I learnt cooking from my mother, I was inspired by my grandfather because I was fascinated with him in the kitchen every Sunday cooking something for us."

I was reminded, well, not of the story, but of the title when we sat down to dinner at Rustoms  a restaurant that serves delicious Parsi food in the Capital  a few nights ago. You could have named our table Seven Hungry Men and Women.I was just making a list of all that we ate, and felt rather embarrassed. We ordered enough for a party of 15. And we finished up almost everything on the table. But let me start at the beginning. A dear friend from Kolkata was in town  ostensibly to see how I was doing. We were meeting her after a long time, so there was much to talk about. So we  a group of seven  gathered at Rustoms.Gourmets delightRustoms has been around for a while in Delhi. I used to hear good things about it when it was at Adhchini. Somehow, I never went there, quite possibly because the traffic there could be manic. But I had been raring to visit the place ever since I heard that Rustoms had moved to the Parsi Anjuman complex on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg.So we gathered there, and ordered chhanch and homemade raspberry soda (Rs. 150 each), sev puri and dahi batata puri (both Rs. 175), Russian pattice (Rs. 295), paatra ni macchhi (Rs. 325), prawn kababs (Rs. 325), salli boti gosht (Rs. 395), chicken dansak (Rs. 175), vegetable Parsi pulao (Rs. 395), caramel custard and lagan nu custard (both Rs. 250) and Bombay kulfi (Rs. 150).I just had a taste of all the fried dishes  and they were delicious. The papri with sev came with a heap of crunchy sev over the papri which had been topped with chopped onion and tomatoes and chutney. The dahi batata puris had potatoes, onions, chutney and a delightfully spiced curd over it. The prawn kababs were again a great mix of mashed prawn and spring onion. But what I really loved was the Rusian pattice  which was a mix of creamy cheese, chicken and mashed potatoes, coated with semolina and some cheese straws and then deep fried. It was  in one word  yum!I had the fish without any guilt pangs. It was a telapiya fillet which had been steamed wrapped in banana leaf after being smeared with sweet, sour and spicy chutney prepared with mint and coriander leaves. I had it with the vegetable pulao and loved it. I am told the prawn berry pulao is a must-have there, but we had friends with a prawn allergy, so steered clear of it.The salli boti gosht  mutton with a spicy tomato gravy topped with crispy potato straws  was nice and rich. I thought the chicken dhansak was just about ok. It seemed like a normal dhansak with minced chicken balls on the side.But I loved the desserts. I thoroughly enjoyed the creamy caramel custard and lagan nu custard  baked with nuts and raisins (I could taste the chironjee). The Bombay kulfi got over before I could even look at it. The mawa cake came gratis but was avoidable, I think.Way to goSo book a table and head for Rustoms at the Parsi Anjuman or Dharamshala. This is the sprawling Parsi complex (ample parking space there) next to the Maulana Azad Medical College, on the other side of the road from all the newspaper offices (Phone: 09910060502 and 01133106353).We left after the dessert but the other five lingered over coffee. And after eating and drinking all that, they eyed the food on other peoples tables and decided that the next time they are there, they will have a thaali. The vegetable thaali (Rs. 400) has soya pattice, Parsi dal, tarkari ni curry, vengna nu achar, steamed rice, Parsi rotis and chutney. The mutton thaali is for Rs. 495 and the pomfret one for Rs. 695. We will wait for the friend from Kolkata to come for another visit, and the Seven Hungry Men and Women shall return."

Farmers markets emerged on the scene almost a decade ago with Kavita Mukhis weekly market in Bandra that attracts a posse of dedicated shoppers. Since then, markets have sprung up in several neighbourhoods from Nariman Point, Shivaji Park, and Juhu to Powai, Thane and Vashi. In September, Caf Zoe launched a one-of-its-kind farmers market right inside their sprawling, light-filled space.The restaurant partnered with Taru Naturals, which works with small-scale farmers across India to provide resources and clean tech to enable organic farming. We met Tarus founder/CEO Ruchi Jain, who holds a Masters in Environment Change & Management from Oxford University, and is a passionate advocate of natural, organic farming.To marketWhat we need is to have thousands of farmers markets. People need to see that organic can be affordable, said Jain. Affordability has long been a pain point for the organic movement but the fresh fruits and vegetables at Caf Zoes farmers market are surprisingly well priced and of high quality. We stocked up on tomatoes and cucumbers, both sweet and flavourful, while the pomegranates are the deepest red we have seen and positively bursting with juice. All vegetables and fruits sold at the market come from Anil Rayates farm in Niphad in Nashik district. While farmers around him concentrate on grapes (Nashiks main cash crop), Rayate instead decided to go the organic route in 2009 with a mixed farm where he grows everything from leafy greens to onions, garlic, and other vegetables. He proudly showed us his certification from Participatory Guarantee System for India (PGS-India) a government body that certifies organic farming practices across India.I use traditional farming techniques like natural mulching, using jivamrut fertiliser (a fermented mixture of dung and urine of Indian Gir cows, jaggery, soil, and water), and natural fungicide made of fermented sugarcane juice, cow dung, yoghurt etc., explained Rayate.What made Caf Zoe venture into this area? We are now six-and-a-half years old and it has always been our plan to support communities, not just be a restaurant. Luckily we have been blessed with a large space that enables us to do these things, said Tarini Mohindar, co-founder of Caf Zoe. Mohindar had been toying with the idea of a farmers market for a while and had even spoken to a few organisers. But I didnt want to do something that was massive, just create a space where you can go and stock up on your veggies for the week, and you dont pay through your nose for it. You have a certificate that tells you its organic and theres no middleman involved, she explained. Mohindar met Jain at a pottery workshop organised at Caf Zoe (conducted by Jains sister), and was impressed with the work that Taru Organics did at the grassroots level. The restaurant has held two farmers markets since mid-September and the response has been encouraging. The Sunday brunch crowd has been leaving with bags filled with fresh produce as well as organic staples such as millets, dals, indie rice varieties like Indrayani, khapli wheat (emmer, an ancient wheat variety) atta, jaggery, turmeric, and more. Apart from partnering for the market, Caf Zoe sources produce from Taru Naturals, which also supplies to a handful of Mumbai restaurants like Kala Ghoda Caf, The Pantry, The Bombay Canteen, Olive, SodaBottleOpenerWala etc.Growing trendAs restaurants increasingly make an effort to source organic, a growing tribe of entrepreneurs is stepping in to fulfil the demand. One such is Zama Organics founded by Shriya Naheta. She graduated three years ago and returned to Mumbai from Los Angeles only to find that high-quality, organic produce was hard to come by at reasonable prices. What really inspired me to start Zama were the travels I went on after I was back. I went on a few trips to Uttarakhand and happened to visit farms in Pune and Nashik as well said Naheta. She started working directly with farmers to source organic produce locally, and currently works with three collectives  one small-time farmer in Pune and a group of farmers each in Nashik and Uttarakhand. One of my main sources is in Uttarakhand in a remote and inaccessible location above Nainital; they are so particular about crop rotation, and the time they sow the seeds or harvest the produce. They have really great irrigation from spring waters from the Himalayas, amazing air quality, and they have always grown organically. Everything they need for farming is grown in the farm itself; whatever vegetables get spoiled are inevitably converted into compost to be used back in the farming process, explained Naheta. Zama Organics supplies to restaurants like Masque, Suzette, Sequel, Rolling Pin, Quattro etc.Naheta also launched value-added products like honeys, jams, chutneys, and pickles, which were recently showcased at a four-course dinner at Masque. We want to really educate people on the concept of sustainability and gradually but surely create a shift, where people look at the benefits of eating sustainably grown and wholesome food, she said.Jain agrees; Restaurants are the harbingers of food innovation in India. So if restaurants like Caf Zoe make a statement with such markets that support small-scale organic farmers, we can get the message across, she said. Rayate had the last word; Now, everyone knows the ill effects of chemicals used in farming. Natural farming is the only solution if we have to sustain this for our future generations he said.Fresh produce and staples from Taru Naturals (tarunaturals.com) and Zama Organics (zamaorganics.com) can be ordered online with delivery available across Mumbai. The next Farmers Market at Caf Zoe will be held on Sunday, November 25 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m."

And on their way back from Ghosh Mansion, Aaduri gives Hem the lowdown on Lata and Ronny.Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, arguably the greatest exponent of relationships in literary Bengal, had written in Devdas that childhood love was, for all its intensity, ultimately cursed. It seldom led to happily ever-afters.But we are both over 18, Kakimoni, Lata had replied, softly, suddenly maudlin even though she found the possibility that what they had  that perfect, fragrant, sunset-coloured thing  might be poisoned to be highly remote. Shed buried her nose in the pink pashmina shawl she had stolen that season from Manjulikas almirah.When shed lifted her head, she saw Kakimoni smiling. Whaaat? shed said, and Kakimoni shucked her chin. That pink is perfect for people newly in love, shed laughed. You are right, it doesnt apply to those who are not children. But Kakimoni said that tartly, raising her eyes in the direction of the verandah where Ronny was bickering with Molly over the carrom board, much like a minor. Well find out, wont we? she said, Whether you were children or adults!Kakimoni would then heave herself from the bed and go out to their little kitchen, carved out of a nook where a tertiary stairway had been boarded up  the Ghoshes had all divided up their kitchens by then  in order to make them scrambled egg sandwiches with cheese. And Lata would drag herself out of bed and curl up in one of the Bombay fornicators kept outside on the verandah (neither she nor Ronny knew the term then), five of them in a line, and impatiently wait for Ronny to stop playing carrom and revise economics with her. Its he who needs the revision more, she would huff. But the sight of him and Molly wrapt in play also made for a pleasant picture. Once, unknown to Ronny, she had snuck his camera out of his bag and taken pictures of them.Where are those pictures? she wonders. Hadnt Ronny framed one and given it to her?When theyd broken up, shed told Kakimoni bitterly, on a weekend she was home with dark circles under her eyes, You were right. Childhood love is poisoned.Not me, Kakimoni had replied sadly, enveloping her in a hug, Sarat-babu.***The Bombay fornicators are long gone.Lata stands now where they used to be lined up and watches as the lights over the courtyard come on. It was Ghosh Mansion all this while; now, in the blink of an eye, it is transformed from a decaying house in a decaying neighbourhood into an unfamiliar place, a new continent, one where happiness and success and glory are all a handspan away for the taking.After Latad taken charge of the Molly-AJ wedding, along with the army Nimki had summoned from the massive contacts list on her phone, Ghosh Mansion had suddenly come alive in the last two days. Given the paucity of time, the rooms on the ground floor were all locked up for the evening in lieu of being cleaned (Lata kept a roster of the keys and promised the various owners of said rooms that it was a temporary matter). The corridor and the courtyard leading to the naach ghar were scrubbed clean. Not even a speck of dust should be visible to the Marwaris, Nimki was heard shouting every 10 minutes or so, Mollys mother-in-law has OCD and we better live up to her standards of cleanliness. In any case, Molly doesnt know any housework. If they see dirty corridors here, they will always link the two. FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE. Lata had also decided that since there was no time to get the walls painted, a major red herring was required. She cajoled the electrician to create a canopy of twinkling lights over the courtyard.The effect, Lata now sees, feeling quite pleased with herself, is magical.Molly steps out of Kakimonis bedroom in her engagement outfit and sighs at the lights. She wears a white chanderi full skirt trimmed beautifully in gold, paired with a post-box red choli. Much to her mothers unhappiness, shes refused to wear anything around her neck but the plain gold choker that Manjulika and Lata had given her from Manjulikas own collection and a pair of gold danglers that had been their great-grandmothers.Lata looks critically at Molly, straightens her tikli  the sole item from her parents trousseau  and then, gently kisses her cheek.I dont know what Id have done without you, Molly murmurs into her hair.Im glad I am here. And I hope you and AJ will come to London and stay with me so I can dispense jamai aador and luchis like a grown-up Ghosh.Molly squeezed her hands. Boro Jethis gold bracelet, studded with pearls and rubies, glittered. It had been a pair that, Lata knew, was given to Jethima, the eldest daughter-in-law, by their grandmother, and Jethima had given her one at her wedding, reserving the other for Molly. What about Goopys bride? Manjulika had said to Jethima then. Arre baba, Jethima had replied conspiratorially, Goopys wife will get a lot!I miss Goopy, Molly said.I was just thinking about him! Lata exclaimed, Anyway, now listen, Bobbys just texted me. They are about 15 minutes away. I think you should go now and sit in the throne room. Guests have arrived. Wheres the entourage?Almost as though theyd heard her, Mollys girlfriends, the old ones from school and college and the new ones from Berlin, all trooped out of her room, where theyd been getting ready. Their individual beauty enhanced by the collective glamour, the girls held themselves erect and frowned in concentration, speaking to each other in code. Lata did not miss a single detail of this pageantry: the wisps of hair slipping out of elaborate hairdos, the silken saris curving and catching at unaccustomed feet. They walked up to the balustrade awkwardly and then, finally finding their stride in their saris, followed Molly down the elaborate staircase, where ancestors in gilt frames looked down at them approvingly.Lata took pictures on her phone, waving the girls away, exhorting them to mind the way. A few minutes later, as they crossed the courtyard, carefully carefully, doddering on their high heels, saris and lehngas bunched up so that their calves were briefly visible, the lights fell on their youthful faces and covered them with stardust.From upstairs, in her pink-yellow tussore sari, Lata watched them and marvelled at the fierce brevity of childhood and youth.Now it was here. Alive and flickering in the stack of Mills and Boon novels under her bed, clattering upon the carrom board, surfacing in the large cupboards in the store room which were perfect for stolen kisses and the third-floor terrace which was perfect for horrible fights.And now it was gone.***First came the ashirbad and then the ring ceremony. The Jaiswals and the Ghoshes and the Germans and the assorted others all mingled happily, eating the delicious (if vegetarian) hors doeuvres and drinking gallons of Blue Lagoon.As regards the food, Boro Jethu had firmly put his feet down. At the Oberoi, they could serve whatever mishmash modern cuisine they wanted to, but at home, it would be old-fashioned comfort food. It was a gargantuan tragedy that the affair had to be made vegetarian. Yes, there would be piles of motorshutir kochuri with stuffed aloor dom and chholar dal with coconut bits. Yes, the old thakurs would whip up family secrets that would never ever be revealed to the Jaiswals. And yes, there would be five kinds of savoury fries, excluding mochar chop and five kinds of mishti, excluding doi. No chatter about calories would be entertained. No dahi vada, golgappa or that sort of rubbish would be served. They were the Ghoshes after all. And there was no question of serving any kind of fancy salad with imported leaves, olive oil and vinegar  only the time-honoured slices of cucumber, tomato and onion on a plate, along with mustard and mayonnaise.Lata had escaped the vice grip of relatives, who had far too many questions than she could handle and whose comments about how slim her waist still was and how expensive her sari looked were all lined with a certain malice. She now stood in a corner and exchanged notes about the next day with a surly Bobby. (Who looked smoky-eyed and bewitching in a black chikankari anarkali set with mukaish work on it.)Whos that? Bobby asked, suddenly interested in a man who had walked up to Nimki and had clasped her hands in his. He wore a beautifully tailored suit, in charcoal grey, and suddenly Lata found herself looking away.(To be continued)"

Hariharan has requested the Chief Wildlife Warden (CWW), Tamil Nadu, to take necessary steps to translocate a wild elephant that has been damaging crops and houses in the Thadagam valley near Coimbatore city.The letter was sent to the CWW on Tuesday, a day after 150 farmers from Thadagam valley petitioned the District Collector, seeking the translocation of wild elephants that are entering villages.The letter seeks capture and translocation of one male wild elephant while two male elephants -- Chinna Thambi and Vinayagan, as named by villagers -- were damaging crops in the valley.The letter said that a male wild elephant was causing problems to the farmers and the public in peripheral areas such as Varapalayam, Pannimadai, Periyathadagam, and Chinnathadagam for the last six months. The animal damaged crops such as tomato, maize, banana and coconut cultivated in areas adjoining the forest.Several steps have been taken by the Forest officials to drive the elephant into the deep forest. But, the elephant often returns to these places and causes damages, said the letter.In October and November, five persons were killed in the attack of wild elephants in Coimbatore Forest Division.The deceased included a member of a Rapid Response Team of the Forest Department engaged in frontline works.A senior official from the Forest Department said that it was for the CWW to take a final call on issuing orders to capture and translocate the wild elephant.Capture and translocation should be the last resort if other measures of mitigating the situation fail. The Forest Department is expected to take a decision which balances the Nature and the sentiments and concerns of the farmers, said Ajay Desai, consultant for the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and member of Asian elephants specialist group of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).P. Kandasamy, District Secretary of Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam, said the Forest Department should eliminate the animal if it was unable to translocate it.

""Unfortunately Dr Jichkar is no more, but I decided to take his research further,"" said Dixit. Since increase of insulin in blood, usually released after meals, triggers obesity, insulin-resistance and type-2 diabetes, Dixit advises restricting all eating during the day to just two meals.""We appointed Dixit as brand ambassador after we found that his diet plan to tackle obesity and diabetes is yielding results,"" said BJP leader Girish Mahajan, who heads the medical education department.Dr Jagannath Dixit, who has been teaching for 26 years and has won several national and state awards, explained that if insulin level rises in blood, it can trigger many health hazards.Once insulin level rises, the body uses glucose for energy; and if insulin level falls, the body uses fatty acids. As baseline insulin secretion cannot be controlled voluntarily, one option is to control the number of times insulin is secreted into the blood after every eating episode. As more or less the same amount of insulin is secreted every time, irrespective of the quantity of food consumed, reducing eating frequency can reduce the insulin level. So, Dixit's advice is to eat twice when one is hungry; in between two meals, one can drink water, diluted, home-made buttermilk, green or black tea (without sugar), coconut water and one tomato.Dixit claims the simple lifestyle modification is effective in losing weight as well as diabetes reversal. ""If one follows the two-meal practice, I am sure there will not only be weight loss, but it will help in controlling diabetes. Reversal of diabetes is also possible,"" said Dixit.After naming Dixit the ambassador to spread awareness about fighting lifestyle diseases that are proving to be a huge burden for India as well as the state, Mahajan told TOI: ""We have launched a campaign to tackle obesity and diabetes. Dr Dixit has done his own research on the diet plan, obesity and diabetes. He has delivered lectures across the state and international platforms, too, and has come to certain conclusions. We felt it will be appropriate if we appoint him our brand ambassador, it will go a long way in promoting the message to fight obesity and diabetes.""Dixit has been a tireless campaigner for weight loss and reversal of diabetes for the last 10 years, spreading his message through 250 WhatsApp group and other social media platforms. He has more than 50,000 followers from 37 countries."

Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.Pune: In an eight-month low, the tomato prices in November have fallen to Rs3 to Rs6 per kilogram in the wholesale market. The prices are also significantly lower than the wholesale rates prevalent during the same time last year  tomatoes were being sold for between Rs12 and Rs35 per kg in November 2017.The retail price for this kitchen staple, however, is still steady at Rs20 per kg.In July this year, the price per kg of tomato in the wholesale market was between Rs5 and Rs 14. And the rates have been going south since then. They are now less than half of what they were in October and November 2017, the data available with the Pune Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) revealed.The tomato production this year was very good, despite drought-like conditions in parts of the state. APMC officials said the prices have dropped because the tomato supply to the wholesale market has increased.Last year, the prices were high during this period. Anticipating similar prices this year, the farmers cultivated more tomatoes in 2018 as well, said Vilas Bhujbal, the president of the Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard Traders and Agents Association. The farmers in one area grew more tomato crops without realising that their counterparts in other places too were planning on growing more tomatoes. This led to a glut in the market and the prices fell, Bhujbal added.The government should have a mechanism in place to avoid similar situations. The government should conduct studies using satellite imageries  to gauge the extent of agricultural land where a particular crop has been sown. Even the farmers can benefit from such knowledge. If too much of one particular crop has been sown in a season by some farmers, others can limit its cultivation by sowing other crops, he said.Sanjay Pawar, a farmer from Nashik, said tomato production has been bountiful in many locations this time. Apart from Nashik in Maharashtra, even places in Rajasthan and Gujarat have reported bountiful tomato crops. If production is high in Rajasthan and Gujarat as well, then there is always a possibility that tomatoes from Maharashtra will not be exported to those states as they too are experiencing a glut. Also, exports of vegetables to Pakistan have either stopped or slowed down, he said.Shriram Gadhave, the president of the Vegetables Growers Association of India, however, said that excess production of tomatoes in the current period is from regions where the water table has still not dipped considerably, despite the drought declared earlier.While tomato wholesale prices have come down, retail prices have stayed put at around Rs20 per kg. Yakub Pathan, owner of the Fresh Vegetable Market in Wakad, said, Wholesale tomato prices have come down to Rs3 to Rs6 per kg, but retailers are maintaining a status quo on the prices. Even if prices in the wholesale market increase to Rs10-Rs12 per kg, we will continue to sell tomatoes at Rs20."

Since the plastic ban will soon come into effect, people need to be educated about the various alternatives available to make the switch easier, he said.A total of 63 stalls have been set up with manufacturers exhibiting their products that include mini biogas plants and eco-friendly sanitary pads.Green India, a firm from Virudhunagar, has created pencils and pens made out of recycled plastic and have attached small seeds of chilli and tomatoes to make it attractive for children. Since a large amount of wood is used to produce pencils, we decided to make the change and attach seed pellets to the back of pencils. We make environment-friendly invitation cards too, said R.

Each standard has the ability to earn at least Rs. 2,500 every week if they contribute enough waste. We in turn sell it to recyclers. The system promotes waste segregation and educates children about reusing biodegradable waste, said N.

He began growing exotic vegetables like red cabbage, yellow cherry tomato, table radish, broccoli and turnip that have high value.He sells his produce to malls in Mysuru, Bengaluru, Goa and Hyderabad besides big vegetable shops. Now, he grows nearly 25 such varieties and has started exploring the online marketplace. We have created two clusters of farmers for growing foreign vegetable varieties organically. The intention is to ensure their availability at the doorsteps of consumers in Bengaluru and Mysuru through online markets, he says.The University of Agricultural Sciences-Bengaluru (UAS-B) on Friday honoured him with district-level best farmer award at Krishi Mela.More yieldAnother farmer to be honoured by the UAS-B on Friday was Siddappa. The 31-year-old hails from Taggaluru of Gundlupet taluk. He grows cotton, jowar, sugarcane and banana.But his innovation lies in maximising profit by taking up related works, including a plant nursery which fetches him about Rs. 15,000 a month. He has also set up a flour mill that works on his diesel-run tiller so that villagers need not depend on power supply for grinding grains."

Trees were uprooted in RM Colony, MVM Nagar, NGO Colony and other stretches.According to Horticulture department officials, around 280 hectares of crops, including corn, plantain, mango, drumsticks, onion, hill banana, beans and tomato in Oddanchatram, Palani and Reddiarchatram were affected. The worst hit farms were in Kodaikanal hills. Collector T. G. Vinay, District Monitoring Officer Mangat Ram Sharma and other officials were closely monitoring the situation. As and when there were distress calls, the officials exclusively earmarked for carrying out rescue operations were rushed to the spot. Awareness to communicate and reach out to first responders saved many lives and cattle, an official told.Dam level upMany dams witnessed steady rise in inflow since forenoon. The Palar-Porundalar dam near Palani reached its full capacity. The Varadamanadhi dam was overflowing and about 6,000 cusecs of water was discharged from the reservoir. The Mavoor dam near Sirumalai had also touched its full capacity.Many pockets in and around Natham benefited from the rainfall. From as early as 3 a.m., Parali, Vathipatti, Ulupakudi, Koilpatti and other villages experienced steady rain. Tanks which were dry turned full within a few hours. The villagers, particularly, the elders expressed happiness as after nearly a decade a tank in Sithayankottai, near Athur was full. Likewise, Nochiodai tank in S Pudukottai near Krishnapuram too was full. A 100-year-old neem tree was uprooted in the rains in the town.Roads along Nilakottai, Chinnalapatti and Kanniwadi were badly damaged. Due to heavy rain and gusty wind, visibility was poor and many motorists took shelter as a precaution.Trains detainedTrains from Madurai bound for destinations like Mumbai suffered detention as the tracks were damaged. According to railway officials, the Nagercoil-Mumbai Express, Tirunelveli-Mayiladuthurai, Guruvayur-Chennai Express and others had to be detained in between Kodai Road and Ambatturai railway stations. Only after the repair works were carried out, the trains could pass the stretch at five kilometre speed.Two casualtiesTwo persons identified as Neelima, 25, wife of Jerinraj and their child Madhav, 2, were returning from Kodaikanal to Thrisur, Kerala. As the vehicle approached Kallaraimedu ghat section, a tree fell on the car, in which the woman died. In another incident, a 55-year-old man Karupasami of Venkatapuram, near Odaipatti in Oddanchatram taluk died when a tree fell on him.The rainfall recorded (in mm) in the district at 5.30 p.m. was as follows: Dindigul: 58.8, Kodaikanal: 138.50, Palani: 34.2, Chatrapatti (Oddanchatram): 26.2, Natham: 44, Nilakottai: 93, Vedasandur: 22, Vedasandur (Tobacco station): 22, Kamatchipuram: 60, Kodaikanal Boat Club: 130 mm. Total: 628.70 and Average: 62.87 mm, PWD officials said."

She loves to cook and wrote her first recipe book, Miss Masala: Real Indian Cooking for Busy Living, around eight years ago. Mallika Basu  former Bengal chief minister Jyoti Basus granddaughter  has more kitchen wisdom and scrumptious meals to share in her second cookbook, Masala. Sprinkled with memories of Sunday lunches with her politician grandfather and secret recipes from her north Indian maternal grandmother, Mallika has whipped up a delicious hardback of slow feasts, classic curries, sweet treats, quick fixes and more. We caught up with her on an email chat.What inspired you to write a cookbook, as there are several on Indian cuisine already?This is a very personal book that was inspired by my own experience of trying to fit Indian cooking into a busy family, social and professional life.I use a lot of cookbooks and found myself finding ways to simplify the recipes in them and the recipe instructions being given to me by my family. A lot of Indian recipes are based on nostalgia and age-old traditions, but we dont live the way our parents and grandparents did. Even my mother (theatre veteran Dolly Basu) and her friends use great little shortcuts to make food simpler to cook and more wholesome.I found myself reaching for gadgets, innovative food products/ingredients, and easy cheats that dont compromise on flavour. I saw a gap in the market for an Indian cookbook that reflects the way we live now  for busy people, who dont have much help in the kitchen and want to get wholesome, delicious food on the table for friends and family.The design aesthetic of contemporary India was also important for me to reflect. The Western view of India is all elephants and paisley, despite the beautiful, minimalist Indian design I have been enjoying. We were keen to capture the texture and colours of handloom, architecture and nature in the look and feel of the book.How did you go about curating the dishes?I started with mealtime moments. We Indians love our breakfast, and there is a huge trend of lazy brunches, so that had to be a chapter. I also love entertaining, so feasts needed to feature. Then I included family favourites from my homes in Calcutta and London. A lot of recipes from Delhi feature, where my mum is from and where I worked briefly. Then there are several Bengali recipes. But importantly, we were a cosmopolitan bunch and recipes from other communities featured too. I am very influenced by Gujarati food, for instance, and I travelled extensively in Kerala, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and even researched Calcutta food. So recipes from there feature too.Masala has many anecdotes from your childhood, involving your grandfather Jyoti Basu. What was your relationship with him like?It was like any other relationship between a doting grandfather and his besotted granddaughter. Dadu called me his crown princess and was keenly interested in my academic and other achievements. When I participated in a beauty contest and came last, it didnt stop him from driving his convoy straight to our home and chanting beauty queen, beauty queen as he came up the stairs to see me. He looked so glum in photos but he sprung to life and smiles when he was around us. When I got married, his one concern was that I would give up my career. So I think hed be proud that I have not one but three full-blown ones, including motherhood!Any food memory from your childhood that comes to mind?Sunday lunch was a big tradition at our home (in Salt Lake). I always remember lazy afternoons with lilting Bollywood tunes, vodka cocktails for the grown-ups, my dad (Chandan Basu) stirring slowly and the kids filling up on chanachur while lunch took ages to cook. I also have not-so-fond memories of driving my mother crazy at mealtimes. I was a very fussy eater and skinny child. My poor mother oversaw the most amazing food, which I would reject without even trying. I did eventually grow out of it though, as is probably evident!An easy version of burgers  Chappli Kebab Picture from Mallikas InstagramIn the book, you mention that you have been influenced by your maternal grandmother a lot...Nani is a proper matriarch with Afghan blood in her. She was actively involved in our parenting and a strong influence on food, culture and others. I used to travel with her to Delhi for my winter holidays and have the best time. She gave up non-vegetarian food when she lost her husband, but still cooked excellent chicken curry. Thanks to her, I enjoyed the best of Delhi home cooking  rajma chawal, kadhi pakora, gajar methi, and parathas stuffed with absolutely everything.I called her when I was writing Masala and we had an awkward conversation, as she is hard of hearing, until I asked her for her recipe of nimbu ka achaar. She sprung to life and after much testing, the recipe has now been perfected for modern kitchens and is in my book.To be honest, I had all manner of busy people in mind. A lot of my followers are young families, professionals without kids and silver surfers who are enjoying their kitchens and cooking in a new way. I live in London, so some of the recipes do need to be adapted for international kitchens but its never complicated and nothing an instinctive regular cook cant manage. I know a lot of Indians who move away from home to study, or to get married or for work. They buy my book because they find the recipes are so doable and always taste right.In the age of quick tutorial videos, do you see a cookbook being relevant?Absolutely. Quick tutorial videos are great, but there is only so much you can cram into a short video. Cookbooks are increasingly being bought for longevity, because they offer something over and beyond just recipes. A video tutorial can never replace that.Is cooking a passion or is it just a hobby or something more?All of the above. I find it very relaxing and often cook after a long day to unwind. But more than that I am passionate about addressing misperceptions about Indian cooking that exist. Its not as complicated, difficult and time consuming as people think. Thats what got me writing about food. All you need is know-how, great recipes and a fantastic cookbook.Channa Dal, Mustard Prawn Curry, and two favourites  Peas Pulao and Saag Aloo Picture from Mallikas InstagramAt home, what kind of cooking would we find in your kitchen?I often use my own cookbook, so thats very much the kind of Indian food you would eat if you came to my home. I love other cuisines, and so Indian dishes take pride of place alongside Chinese, Japanese, Persian, Italian and much more. My family loves variety; the kids especially are gourmet babies, with a very wide-ranging palate and love for food and cooking. So its a mixed bag. The food is always wholesome, well balanced and simply cooked.What kind of influence does your husbands half-Peruvian and half-British heritage have on your cooking?I was quite lucky that Peruvians like flavour and lots of chillies! I never had to tone down our spicier dishes for him... We met at university in London through Gujarati friends and the rest, as they say, is history!How much of Indian culture are your kids exposed to?They call themselves half-Indian and love dressing up in their festive Indian clothes and eating Indian food. I often make dosas and chillas at home for weekend breakfast, which they eat before you can wink. And they love going on holiday to India. Sadly, I havent been great at teaching them Hindi or Bengali. Still they are only small so there is hope!How do you make time for this alongside a career in communications?They say if you want something done, give it to a busy person! But seriously, I have been very blessed with the support of my husband, my family and friends. I also gave up a full-time role in communications in favour of consulting, so I now have a portfolio career that allows me the flexibility of enjoying my day job and indulging my passion. Hopefully, I am living proof of my own unique difference  that I am a busy home cook writing delicious recipes that work for other busy home cooks.What is next in the cooking space for you?I am still busy promoting the book and it is such a labour of love that I am trying to slow down and savour every minute. Watch this space for my next venture!Macchli Curry (Simple Fish Curry) Source: MasalaRecipe for Macchli Curry(Simple Fish Curry) (Serves 2-4)Coated in turmeric and chilli and simmered in a gently spiced curry, this is a very simple way to enjoy fish with the lightest of spices. Fish in India comes from both the fresh waters of its lakes and rivers and from the sea. Although foreign varieties such as basa are gaining popularity in restaurants and supermarkets, the morning trip to the fish market for the catch of the day remains a firm tradition in the fish-loving states. In Bengal, for instance, this is traditionally a job for the man of the house, who prides himself on his masterful bargaining with the sellers.

5ce6e139e8e3fc56af415af6,There are more than a 100 varieties of pasta!,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/food/there-are-more-than-a-100-varieties-of-pasta/cid/1675208,2018-11-14,,Telegraph,"Chefs Piero Ditrizio (left) and Simone de Siato after the masterclass at the IIHM Calcutta Gourmet Studio Pictures: Arnab Mondal and Rashbehari DasIIHM Calcutta signed an MoU with Intrecci and Campus Etoile Academy. To mark the occasion, a specially curated evening of Italian Gastronomy  Il Tavola Italiano, was organised. We spoke to the two Italian chefs -- Piero Ditrizio and Simone de SiatoWhat is a typical meal like in an Italian home?Simone: When it comes to Italian cuisine, regions have major roles to play. Everything we eat at home is totally dominated by the region we are in.Piero: In the south of Italy people eat a lot of eggplant. You will find heavy use of olive oil in the southern part, whereas in the north, the use of butter is more. So food varies according to the region. Nowadays you will find chefs creating and fusing different regions in the food they make but predominantly, Italian cuisine is about following and sticking to tradition.What are the must-have ingredients in Italian cuisine?Simone: Tomato, olive oil, basil, parmesan, balsamic vinegar, mascarpone and pasta. One of the most prominent features of the cuisine is that everything is fresh, so that you get the real taste of the ingredients. South of Italy uses a lot of rice while the use of wheat is more in the northern region. One thing common to both the regions is tomato.What lies behind the appeal of Italian cuisine?Piero: Italian cuisine is quite simple. The ingredients are low-fat and theres no overcooking involved. Olive oil is good for health. The use of butter is minimal.What are the different kinds of pasta?Simone: There are more than 100 varieties! This again depends on the region. You can make 10 different types of pasta with a single dough. Making pasta is something we learn at home as a child. Everything is handmade, rolled by hand too. There are two main types  fresh and dry. Dry pasta is industrial pasta. Its made with semolina flour and the quality of semolina is very important. If the texture of the pasta is smooth, it isnt good. It should be a little rough so that it can retain the sauce. The temperature at which pasta is dried is important too. Pasta should be dried at a low temperature. The more time it takes for the pasta to dry, the more time it takes to cook and the better is the mouthfeel. Fresh pasta is anyway rough because its handmade.Do Italian families bond over cooking?Piero: Family is something that plays an important role, it forms the base. Recipes from grandmothers and mothers are preserved in Italian households. The traditional recipes are important to us, be it for pastas or pastries. Even if I make my own creations, its important to form the base which has its roots in the traditional recipes and ingredients.Any myths you would want to bust about Italian food?Simone: We have many other desserts other than Tiramisu, like Baba with Rum. Also, we dont eat as much cheese as people think we do. People go for pizza once a week, it isnt something that we eat all the time."
5ce6e18be8e3fc56af415b3e,"Gene-edited food is coming, but will shoppers buy?",http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2018/nov/14/gene-edited-food-is-coming-but-will-shoppers-buy-1898217.html,2018-11-14,,The New Indian Express,"By Associated PressWASHINGTON: The next generation of biotech food is headed for the grocery aisles, and first up maybe salad dressings or granola bars made with soybean oil genetically tweaked to be good for your heart.By early next year, the first foods from plants or animals that had their DNA ""edited"" are expected to begin selling. It's a different technology than today's controversial ""genetically modified"" foods, more like faster breeding that promises to boost nutrition, spur crop growth, and make farm animals hardier and fruits and vegetables last longer.The U.S. National Academy of Sciences has declared gene editing one of the breakthroughs needed to improve food production so the world can feed billions more people amid a changing climate. Yet governments are wrestling with how to regulate this powerful new tool. And after years of confusion and rancor, will shoppers accept gene-edited foods or view them as GMOs in disguise?""If the consumer sees the benefit, I think they'll embrace the products and worry less about the technology,"" said Dan Voytas, a University of Minnesota professor and chief science officer for Calyxt Inc., which edited soybeans to make the oil heart-healthy.Researchers are pursuing more ambitious changes: Wheat with triple the usual fiber, or that's low in gluten. Mushrooms that don't brown, and better-producing tomatoes. Drought-tolerant corn, and rice that no longer absorbs soil pollution as it grows. Dairy cows that don't need to undergo painful de-horning, and pigs immune to a dangerous virus that can sweep through herds.Scientists even hope gene editing eventually could save species from being wiped out by devastating diseases like citrus greening, a so far unstoppable infection that's destroying Florida's famed oranges.First they must find genes that could make a new generation of trees immune.""If we can go in and edit the gene, change the DNA sequence ever so slightly by one or two letters, potentially we'd have a way to defeat this disease,"" said Fred Gmitter, a geneticist at the University of Florida Citrus Research and Education Center, as he examined diseased trees in a grove near Fort Meade.GENETICALLY MODIFIED OR EDITED, WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?Farmers have long genetically manipulated crops and animals by selectively breeding to get offspring with certain traits. It's time-consuming and can bring trade-offs. Modern tomatoes, for example, are larger than their pea-sized wild ancestor, but the generations of cross-breeding made them more fragile and altered their nutrients.GMOs, or genetically modified organisms, are plants or animals that were mixed with another species' DNA to introduce a specific trait  meaning they're ""transgenic."" Best known are corn and soybeans mixed with bacterial genes for built-in resistance to pests or weed killers.Despite international scientific consensus that GMOs are safe to eat, some people remain wary and there is concern they could spur herbicide-resistant weeds.Now gene-editing tools, with names like CRISPR and TALENs, promise to alter foods more precisely, and at less cost, without necessarily adding foreign DNA. Instead, they act like molecular scissors to alter the letters of an organism's own genetic alphabet.The technology can insert new DNA, but most products in development so far switch off a gene, according to University of Missouri professor Nicholas Kalaitzandonakes.Those new Calyxt soybeans? Voytas' team inactivated two genes so the beans produce oil with no heart-damaging trans fat and that shares the famed health profile of olive oil without its distinct taste.The hornless calves? Most dairy Holsteins grow horns that are removed for the safety of farmers and other cows. Recombinetics Inc. swapped part of the gene that makes dairy cows grow horns with the DNA instructions from naturally hornless Angus beef cattle.""Precision breeding,"" is how animal geneticist Alison Van Eenennaam of the University of California, Davis, explains it. ""This isn't going to replace traditional breeding,"" but make it easier to add one more trait.RULES AREN'T CLEARThe Agriculture Department says extra rules aren't needed for ""plants that could otherwise have been developed through traditional breeding,"" clearing the way for development of about two dozen gene-edited crops so far.In contrast, the Food and Drug Administration in 2017 proposed tighter, drug-like restrictions on gene-edited animals. It promises guidance sometime next year on exactly how it will proceed.Because of trade, international regulations are ""the most important factor in whether genome editing technologies are commercialized,"" USDA's Paul Spencer told a meeting of agriculture economists.Europe's highest court ruled last summer that existing European curbs on the sale of transgenic GMOs should apply to gene-edited foods, too.But at the World Trade Organization this month, the U.S. joined 12 nations including Australia, Canada, Argentina and Brazil in urging other countries to adopt internationally consistent, science-based rules for gene-edited agriculture.ARE THESE FOODS SAFE?The biggest concern is what are called off-target edits, unintended changes to DNA that could affect a crop's nutritional value or an animal's health, said Jennifer Kuzma of the Genetic Engineering and Society Center at North Carolina State University.Scientists are looking for any signs of problems. Take the hornless calves munching in a UC-Davis field. One is female and once it begins producing milk, Van Eenennaam will test how similar that milk's fat and protein composition is to milk from unaltered cows.""We're kind of being overly cautious,"" she said, noting that if eating beef from naturally hornless Angus cattle is fine, milk from edited Holsteins should be, too.But to Kuzma, companies will have to be up-front about how these new foods were made and the evidence that they're healthy. She wants regulators to decide case-by-case which changes are no big deal, and which might need more scrutiny.""Most gene-edited plants and animals are probably going to be just fine to eat. But you're only going to do yourself a disservice in the long run if you hide behind the terminology,"" Kuzma said.AVOIDING A BACKLASHUncertainty about regulatory and consumer reaction is creating some strange bedfellows. An industry-backed group of food makers and farmers asked university researchers and consumer advocates to help craft guidelines for ""responsible use"" of gene editing in the food supply.""Clearly this coalition is in existence because of some of the battle scars from the GMO debates, there's no question about that,"" said Greg Jaffe of the food-safety watchdog Center for Science in the Public Interest, who agreed to join the Center for Food Integrity's guidelines group. ""There's clearly going to be questions raised about this technology.""SUSTAINABILITY OR HYPE?Gene-editing can't do everything, cautioned Calyxt's Voytas. There are limitations to how much foods could be changed. Sure, scientists made wheat containing less gluten, but it's unlikely to ever be totally gluten-free for people who can't digest that protein, for example  or to make, say, allergy-free peanuts.Nor is it clear how easily companies will be able to edit different kinds of food, key to their profit.Despite her concerns about adequate regulation, Kuzma expects about 20 gene-edited crops to hit the U.S. market over five years  and she notes that scientists also are exploring changes to crops, like cassava, that are important in the poorest countries.""We think it's going to really revolutionize the industry,"" she said."

Identifying with the undistinguished common man, however, comes to them only during 'demanding' situations like an election campaign.The current election is also throwing up some interesting situations involving leaders from across the spectrum joining the man on the street to do what the latter are doing.Ironing clothesFor example, during the last one month of campaigning, the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) candidate for Adilabad Assembly constituency, Jogu Ramanna, who is Forest Minister in the caretaker Cabinet, was seen selling tomatoes in Quila area or ironing clothes at a laundry in Chota Talab locality or playing Boddemma or Bathukamma with women in localities like Kolipura in Adilabad town. Our people are happy to receive these leaders though they are visiting the locality only after four-and-a-half years,"" Aindla Chinna Lasmanna, a resident of Chota Talab generalised as he dwelt upon the trend of leaders personally calling upon voters during the run up to the election.""For the next five years, they will not even roll down the window glasses of their cars to acknowledge our presence,"" he added rather philosophically. There are other leaders too who have tried their hand at shaving while seeking votes at a hair dressers shop or made rotis using firewood while visiting slums. The voters are definitely amused but it is anybody's guess if such gestures influence them.Setting the trendThe trend of politicians indulging in activities which show them as caring personalities was laid by Eenadu Telugu daily in 1982 when it started publishing pictures of thespian N.T. Rama Rao breaking bread with poor families in their meagre homes or taking bath at a road side bore-well during his maiden campaign in the 1983 election for Andhra Pradesh Assembly.The pictures were received well by the public at large, evident from the fact they supported the Telugu Desam Party headed by the actor-turned-politician in that election.In the 2014 election, senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh had extended a helping hand to a tea seller who had set up his push cart at Boath village in Boath (ST) Assembly constituency during his party's election campaign. His action is still remembered by voters of the village."

Silver anklets made in Salem are popular across the country and worldwide and the industry employs a large work force round the year.A resolution adopted at the 16th district level conference of the DYFI here recently said that online trading had hit the silver crafts industry to a big extent and urged the government ban the same.Another resolution said that a large number of farmers were involved in raising flowers in Panamarathupatti and surrounding villages. They were not getting adequate price during the lean period. The government should take initiative to set up a perfume unit in Panaimarathupatti to benefit these farmers.Similarly, Mecheri and surrounding areas were famous for tomatoes. The tasty Mecheri tomatoes had good demand even in the neighbouring states. The setting up of a tomato juice manufacturing unit in Mecheri would immensely benefit the farmers in improving their livelihood.Yet another resolution demanded creation of additional infrastructure in the Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital.The government should remove encroachments from its lands and provide the same as free house site pattas to the weaker sections, and initiate steps to protect the handloom and powerloom units situated in and around Jalagandapuram.P.

The Mandsaur police firing that killed five farmers will be reinvestigated if Congress comes to power, it says.For the first time, Congress promises to launch a Ram Van Gaman Path tour to retrace Lord Ram's footprints in MP, pass a law to protect River Narmada and set up a new 'religion and spiritual department'. It also aims to begin commercial production of cow urine and cowdung cakes. Unlike Chhattisgarh, it hasn't called for prohibition but vows to rid MP of 'intoxicants'.To address upper-caste resentment after amendment of the SC/ST Atrocities (Prevention) Act, the Congress Vachan Patra promises a Samanya Varg Ayog or Commission for general categories to address their issues.The manifesto was released at the state Congress headquarters here on Saturday morning by PCC chief Kamal Nath, state election campaign chairman Jyotiraditya Scindia, former CM Digvijaya Singh, Leader of Opposition Ajay Singh, and former Union ministers Suresh Pachauri and Arun Yadav. Chairman of the manifesto committee Rajendra Singh was also on dais.Congress described it as the voice of people of Madhya Pradesh. There is something for just about everyone  daily wagers, jobless, industrialists, homemakers and even journalists (a law to protect mediapersons), but the focus is clearly on farms and job creation.Kamal Nath told reporters, Congress is not releasing a manifesto for the people of the state. Rather, this is our pledge to bring Madhya Pradesh back on the tracks of development so that farmers can smile, women will feel protected and youth can get employment. In the last 15 years, BJP presented only jumla patras (propaganda deeds) in the name of manifesto and deceived people. Congress is determined to end corruption and mafia rule which starts from villages.Scindia called it a a new morning after 15 years of darkness for farmers, women and youth. Congress has presented its resolution, not just a manifesto, out of the willingness to serve. We have promised progress and development, plus reduction in price of petrol and diesel, justice for slain farmers of Mandsaur and distribution of free laptops to meritorious students in every district. Women will be given priority during recruitment in police force. Industry will be promoted so jobs are created.

The manifesto assures passing a law for right to housing. Rest houses will be built every 15km along the Naramda Parikrama route.The Vachan Patra says that if Congress comes to power, it will bring transparency in recruitments and appointments and Vyapam  which has been in the eye of a storm for eight years  will be shut down. Congress alleges the BJP governments involvement in Vyapam irregularities.Congress manifesto promises more than the BJP governments policies at the Centre and state. While chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan promised bonus on grains like wheat and dal, Congress promises to give bonus to farmers on practically every major crop grown in the state  wheat, paddy, jowar, bajra, corn, soybean, mustard, cotton, arhar, moong, gram and masoor, urad, garlic, onions, tomatoes and sugarcane. The Narendra Modi government in Delhi gave LPG connections to the poor through Ujjwala Yojana, and Congress promises Rs 100 subsidy per cylinder. It plans to raise social security pension from Rs 300 per month to Rs 1,000.We are going to the people with a new thought process, to give the state a new direction, said LOP Ajay Singh."

But we had a look at the manic traffic, and changed our minds. Just the day before, I had been caught in the traffic for what seemed like hours. So, I decided that Id look up Zomato and order something exciting from our part of town.A few minutes of surfing later, I zeroed in on what looked promising  a delivery outlet called Rendezvous Calcutta in Noida. I called up and was told that it has been around for a while, has mostly Bengali food and delivers through Swiggy.Fresh and well-cookedI had an interesting chat with Chef Madhumita, who runs the place (phone numbers: 0120-4267726 and 8826743456). The food is all prepared fresh, so they have to be given some time to cook and deliver. The recipes are authentic, she said, and brushed off one of the Bengali food delivery places that I rather like as not genuine. And she helped me choose our order. We decided on a plate of dhokar dalna (Rs. 160), aloo posto (Rs. 145), shukto (Rs. 145), bori-aloo maachh jhol (Rs. 255), maachher kalia (Rs. 210) and tomato chatni (Rs. 70).The food came within the hour. And we had a delicious lunch, for the dishes, as the chef had promised, were fresh and well cooked. I had the dhokar dalna, which is a dish of steamed besan cakes in thick gravy that I really enjoy. It was superb; the cakes were soft, and the gravy was nice and tasty. I like my aloo posto with more posto (khus-khus, or poppy seed paste) than aloo, but in many kitchens it is cooked the other way around. In Rendezvous, too, it was more of a potato dish than posto. But it had a nice flavourful taste.The shukto, which is usually a cooling summer dish of vegetables in a light sauce, was delicious. It had a mix of vegetables, and the right balance of mildly sweet and bitter tastes. The two fish dishes were outstanding. There were large chunks of potato and fried bori (lentil balls) in bori-aloo maachh jhol, while the maachher kalia gravy was rich and sumptuous. The fish was fresh, and the pieces were large. Most of the gravies were hot, which I enjoyed after months of a low chilli diet. The tomato chatni, however, wasnt all that exciting. I must say Ive had better.Elaborate menuI didnt try out the meat dishes, but will order in another day. They have kosha mutton (Rs. 210), railway mutton (Rs. 375), chicken rezala (Rs. 375) and chicken curry (Rs. 360). There are other kinds of fish dishes, too  such as pabda tomato jhal (Rs. 240) and shorshe pabda (Rs. 230). Vegetarians can try out the aloor dum (Rs. 120), phul kopir dalna (Rs. 145), doi potol (Rs. 145), chholar dal (Rs. 100) and begun bhaja (Rs. 50). They have biryanis and rolls, breakfast fare such as radha bollobhi (stuffed puris with aloo) and snacks such as fish fries and chops.Madhumita tells me that she is not a trained chef, but has always been interested in cooking. She used to be a marketing professional, and then decided to get into the food business. I am glad she did!"

In Thuppaki , we saw that when Vijay gets the help of his fellow army men to stop terrorist attacks happening across the city.In Kaththi , we saw it when Vijay ropes in senior citizens to stop water supply to the city. Even in the recent Spyder, we saw the hero (Mahesh Babu) getting the help of housewives to stop a crime.Sarkar has a long run-time but lacks that one Brand ARM sequence that could have changed the tone of the film. At 163 minutes, it comes across more like a political pamphlet.Vijay is named Sundar Ramaswamy in the film and it looks like his name was coined by mixing the names of Googles CEO and Chennais firebrand activist who has traffic for a sobriquet. Hes globally renowned to be a corporate monster who takes over companies wherever he goes, but hes now in India to cast his vote. But theres a hitch: his vote has already been cast.That much has already been revealed thanks to the trailers, and the first half of Sarkar thankfully takes it one step further. Theres an evil politician (Masilamani, played by Pazha Karuppiah, and as clichd as they come) who is out to ruin the state. Can Sundar  with all his corporate experience (he calls himself a corporate criminal)  stop him from that? Can Sundars wisdom come in handy in rectifying malpractice that has become quite prevalent in Tamil Nadu polls?It is a promising premise and a much-needed one, considering that all of us yearn for change and development, but Sarkar just scratches the surface by putting together a story based on a few recent incidents in the State. It reels off laws and the electoral processes (theres an entire eye-opening-but-lecture-like stretch on Section 49P) just to support Vijays decision to stay back in Chennai and clean the system.The problem with Sarkar is that it has no well-defined characters. Keerthy Suresh has nothing much to do than keep walking with Vijay (literally) while Yogi Babu has a blink-and-miss appearance. It is Varalaxmi who steals the cake, essaying a smooth performance. Sarkar would have been better off had she been introduced earlier.The dialogues, though powerful, reel off much longer than they ought to be. What could have been said in two words: Go vote (admittedly a much-needed social message) gets the entire length of the film, replete with dance and fights.Theres an entire sequence featuring Vijay narrating the story of a tomato that got the claps, but looks oddly out of place. But in these dialogue-heavy sequences that Vijay gets into the act  his control over the emotional sequences is admirable, while hes aggressive in the ones that require him to go a little over-the-top.AR Rahmans songs dont help him much  except the call-for-revolution number Oru Viral, they dont contribute much to take the story forward.Watching Sarkar , I kept thinking of an earlier much-loved Murugadoss film, Ramana (2002), which had Vijayakant taking on corrupt officials. That had the protagonist as a professor but it is Sarkar that feels like the lecture."

The scheme was announced in the budget speech of 2018-19 with an outlay of Rs 500 crore to stabilize the supply of tomato, onion and potato (TOP) and to ensure availability of these crops throughout the country round-the-year without price volatility.Union food processing industry minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, in a press release on Monday, said, Price volatility of TOP crops wreak havoc in the households of this country. This scheme has been prepared after sustained talks with all stakeholders and we will ensure that the TOP crops reach all households in the country all through the year.She said the government had laid down special measures and grants-in-aid under the scheme to ensure enhanced production of TOP crops and to augment value chain. Operation Greens aims to enhance the value realisation of TOP farmers by targeted interventions. These interventions would range from strengthening of production clusters and farmer producer organisations (FPOs) and connecting them with the market to price stabilisation for both producers and consumers through a proper production planning. The measures would include introduction of dual use varieties, reduction in post-harvest losses by creation of farm gate infrastructure, development of suitable agro-logistics, creation of appropriate storage facilities linking consumption centres and increase in food processing capacities. Operation Greens also envisages setting up of a market intelligence network to collect and collate real time data on demand and supply and price of TOP crops.The ministry would provide 50% of subsidy on transportation of TOP crops from production to storage and hiring of appropriate storage facilities, the minister stated."

The prices of other vegetables too were hovering low and the cultivators lamented that it did not even meet their cost of transportation.A. Nagaraju, one of the farmers and who is part of the Raita Mitra company, blamed the APMC officials for being apathetic to the plight of the farmers.Though the Agricultural Price Commission has stipulated that the procurement price should never be below the cost of cultivation it is not implemented and the brokers and middlemen have a field day, he added.Airing concern over the developments, Mr. Nagaraju said only lip sympathy is given to the cause of the farmers but no practical initiatives are taken to bail them out of crisis. Vegetable producers have demanded storage facility with refrigeration, tie-up with food industry for direct procurement from farmers but none of it has been implemented, he added. The bulk of vegetables cultivated in and around Mysuru are brought to the APMC yard which receives produce from Kolar, Nagamangala, Mandya, Hassan and other places. In addition, Jayapura, Hampapura, H.D. Kote, T. Narsipur etc are other places in Mysuru district where vegetables are cultivated on a large scale."

I am always blown away by the quality of food and wine, informed, friendly service and charming down-to-earth no-nonsense Australian attitude to life. There is a humility and dignity which is refreshing and very new world. Sydney is the perfect first stop Down Under and what a foodie paradise it is!Start your journey on Singapore Airlines, not the national carrier Qantas. You wont regret it. Apart from the seamless service, great big seats and plenty of legroom, the food and drinks are outstanding. SIA has won the prestigious award for the Best Overall Wine Cellar 2017.If youre in the rarefied atmosphere of first class, they serve Krug 2004 Champagne and one of the best Aussie wines, a Pinot Noir from Paringa Estate. In business and in all the lounges, youll be very happy with the delicious Charles Heidsieck Brut Reserve. The food is designed by a panel of international chefs, so youll find Indian, Asian and Australian menus on routes Down Under and fabulous illy single-origin coffees, TWG teas, cocktails and mocktails, all served with a smile.Sydney SeaplanesReady for a bit of the high life? The luxury seaplane operator offers sightseeing tours in a classic Beaver aircraft. Whether its a scenic flight over the beautiful Sydney Harbour, a flying journey of the golden sandy Northern Beaches, a romantic picnic for two on a secluded beach, or the best taxi ride to one of Sydneys river or ocean restaurants  Sydney Seaplanes will get you there in style. They take off from Rose Bay, which you can reach by either taxi or even better, a lovely inexpensive ferry ride from Circular Quay. On a fine day, the dashing young pilots in shorts are happy to take you on a scenic tour of Sydney over the Opera House and Harbour Bridge, down along many of Sydneys beautiful northern beaches and harbours to our destination, which happened to be Whale Beach, a stretch of pristine white sand and spectacular views. It would normally take an hour or so to reach here by car from Sydney but in the seaplane it takes only 20 minutes.Tasmanian Pacific Oysters with rice wine vinaigrette at Tetsuyas, which is owned by Tetsuya Wakuda (below) Sourced by The TelegraphTetsuyas restaurantYes, believe it or not, there are some really world-class food experiences to be had in the city. One of my favourite fine dining restaurants is Tetsuyas, which combines a masterful blend of skill, artistry and taste. Tetsuya Wakudas attention to detail is consistent and beyond sublime. Signature dishes include the confit of Ocean trout, consomme of tomato and tea, Tasmanian Pacific oysters with rice wine vinaigrette, tuna with daikon and wasabi, sea scallops with lemonade fruit and yuzu, and the sashimi of hamachi (kingfish) with blood orange and vinaigrette.The petuna ocean trout dish has been served in the restaurant ever since it was a humble first-floor dwelling in a very ordinary suburb of Sydney. Tetsuya was the first chef to discover this fish and to source many wonderful products from all over Australia. Do not leave without trying the warm kombu bread and truffle butter served regularly in between courses. Not that you need any more food but this is a must-do. Tetsuyas only does a degustation menu  10 courses paired with world wines. There is no a la carte. Each dish is truly a culinary masterpiece. If you have the time, budget and inclination (youll have to reserve way in advance), dont miss it. Aus $240 pp for the whole experience.Bondi Beach Sourced by The TelegraphBondi BeachI heard plenty about Bondi Beach but had not realised that it has a sub-culture of its own. Its not just a series of serious beaches (Bondi/Tamarama/Bronte) but an area of great restaurants, cafes and shops which makes Bondi a real Sydney suburb worth talking about well beyond the hippie image it once had. Musts to visit in the area are Camilla for silk kaftans, Gertrude & Alice for books and coffee, and Icebergs for the most spectacular lunch overlooking Bondi Beach. Its not just a restaurant serving outstanding food (not surprisingly a huge variety of seafood and Italian), its a style statement. And dont forget to listen to Bondi 88 FM, the local radio station, while you are there.Jonahs offers an excellent view and seafood Sourced by The TelegraphJonahsPerhaps the only feature that can divert your attention from the stunning view at Jonahs is the exceptional food and wine offering. The award-winning hatted restaurant offers excellent contemporary Australian cuisine under the direction of chef Matteo Zamboni. They were the recipient of Australias Wine List of the Year Awards in 2017 by Gourmet Traveller with a cellar containing over 11,000 bottles of vintage Australian and international wines and a wine list of more than 1,600 different labels.Apart from the fabulous food and wine, Jonahs is a little luxury getaway with 11 beautiful rooms, all with stunning sea views, a spa and all the trimmings. The seafood platter for lunch which consists of a deck of raw and cured fish and oysters to crayfish thermidor and warm Coffin Bay scallops along with a glass of Aussie Arras sparkling, is a must-have. And yes, an added bonus is that you can spot whales as they migrate between May and November.Sydney Opera House Sourced by The TelegraphSydney Opera HouseGo for a guided tour or, even better, go see an opera at any of their six halls. Join the one-hour Essential Tour and see inside the World Heritage-listed House. Your guide will show you the theatres and stages where more than 1,600 performances come to life annually. Youll see some of the thousand rooms and 300 corridors of the building. Youll leave this tour with a fascinating account of the Houses history and architecture  its an exciting introduction to Sydneys vibrant performing arts scene.QT Sydney shares the building with two historical buildings, Gowings and The State Theatre Sourced by The TelegraphQT SydneyA new Australian brand of hospitality, QT Sydney had a much-anticipated opening this year and is the only Sydney hotel to be a member of the exclusive Design Hotels. Rocking the city with their edgy, quirky design, happening F&B spaces, bars and beautifully decorated contemporary rooms, QT Sydney shares the building with two of the citys most majestic historical buildings, Gowings and The State Theatre. The eccentricity of the hotel is offset by the historical features of the building, such as the blend of gothic, art deco, and Italian-influenced architecture. Although I didnt stay at the QT, the vibe intrigued me as I walked in off the busy and bustling Market Street where most of the high-end shopping, restaurants and bars are. I was hoping that quirky didnt stretch to the bedrooms and was pleasantly surprised at the comfort level of their spacious rooms. Apart from this, it seems to be the place for the wild, wacky and cool crowd to party.A salad of spring peas stracciatella, smoked almonds, rye crumble, asparagus and tomato chutney Sourced by The TelegraphBennelong RestaurantUpmarket yet relaxed, Bennelong Restaurant is an absolute treat for lunch. The bar is literally under the Opera Houses shell vaulted sails with spectacular views over the Harbour Bridge. The restaurant with huge glass panels overlooks Circular Quay and the Harbour. The menu is based on award-winning chef Peter Gilmores vision of Australian cuisine. Incidentally, he also runs the other culinary icon in Sydney, Quay restaurant which is just opposite. You can choose from a two- or three-course a la carte menu with service starting early, catering to the pre-theatre dining crowd. Dishes to go for are the salad of spring peas, smoked almonds, asparagus and tomato chutney; wild cape york barramundi and the mooloolaba yellowfin tuna with kohlrabi remoulade. Benelong offers 180 of the countrys favourite and small-scale wine labels from an eclectic collection of winemakers. This is quintessential Sydney for me.An usual evening at Bennelong Restaurant Sourced by The TelegraphSydney fish market Sourced by The TelegraphSydney fish marketFirstly, unlike many fish markets I have visited round the world, it doesnt smell fishy. The variety of Australian seafood alone is quite staggering  from Tasmanian giant abalone and crabs weighing 17kg to prawns, crayfish, Moreton Bay bugs, marons, Balmain bay bugs (all Aussie crustaceans), rock lobster and, of course, oysters galore. Each fishmonger in addition to selling fish has ready-to-eat dishes, including sushi, lobster thermidor and shucked oysters. If that isnt enough, there are plenty of restaurants both within the market and outside where you can enjoy a seafood lunch in comfort.On the first floor is the Sydney seafood school, which conducts cookery classes. On certain days of the week, they also have master classes by Sydneys top chefs. Although most of the classes are over $100 for a two- or three-hour class, lunch or dinner and a glass of wine is included. For someone who really enjoys cooking, this is a must-do. Classes run throughout the week but there seems to be a better choice over the weekend. Check for substantial discounts if youre a group of six or more.Hyatt Sydney Sourced by The TelegraphRock a 180-degree viewLocation. Location. Location. Whoever said that must have been thinking about the Hyatt Sydney. Right opposite the Opera House, under the Harbour Bridge on the edge of the fashionable area known as The Rocks, the Park Hyatt is the place to stay in Sydney if you want a view to beat all views. Choose one of the suites on the circular front of the hotel and youll have a 180-degree view of the Opera House as your 25ft electric curtains draw open. It also has one of the citys nicest restaurants on the ground floor facing the boardwalk and Sydney Harbour.Karen Anand is a culinary consultant, food writer and entrepreneur.

5ce746b3e8e3fc56af41853d,A moveable street feast in Calcutta,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/a-moveable-street-feast-in-calcutta/cid/1673726,2018-11-03,,Telegraph,"A walk down a sidewalk in Calcutta is like walking down a buffet line, writes Christine Kaaloa on her food blog, Grrltraveller. The entry reads: This city is phenomenal when it comes to street food. Some hawkers practically work and sleep in their stalls. Each morning, they wake up and prepare food, hot, spicy and savoury for the hungry passers-by.Calcutta has close to 2,00,000 street food vendors serving over 10 million people daily with over 250 varieties of dishes  soft-boiled duck egg sandwich, uttapam, malai kofta and dal butter fry with masala kulcha or missi roti, dudh puli, sarpuria, whatever not.A recent survey conducted by travel portal booking.com has declared Calcutta the top street food hub of India, ahead of Amritsar, Delhi, Ahmedabad and even Mumbai.Serenaded by honking cars and buses amid smoke and dust, these vendors have been carrying on for decades. Profits are minimal, but sales volumes keep them going.Indira Chakravarty, a public health expert, whose studies on the citys food vendors have led to policy changes at various levels, tries to get street food vendors to cater whenever she organises seminars and conferences.Her reason: street food is safer because vendors rarely store food. As a consultant with the Food Safety and Standards Authority, she has seen how a lot of hotels store meat, poultry and non-vegetarian items for as long as six months. A street vendor prepares food in the morning and by evening everything is sold out, says Chakravarty, who is now chief adviser of West Bengals public health engineering department. As if to underline her point, she orders toast, omelette and peyanji  an onion pakoda variant  from a vendor near her office in Dalhousie Square.Chakravarty has conducted surveys of Calcuttas street food on behalf of the All India Institute of Health and Public Hygiene (AIIHPH), whose results have been feted by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization. The verdict: The spread is tasty and highly affordable. At the time of the survey, in 1995, hygiene standards needed improving.That has changed, Chakravarty says. Our members try to maintain standards and learn the basics of food safety, says Anadi Saha, general secretary of the Hawker Mens Union and Hawker Sangram Committee. He adds, We have had workshops organised by AIIHPH experts.Though much has been done, much remains to be achieved. Vendors dont have a clear idea about harmful artificial colours  like the carcinogenic metanil yellow used in jalebis  or spurious food additives. Neither do they know that deep frying in the same oil is bad for health. But the biggest bugbear seems to be the lurking extortionists with their continuing threats of ousting vendors.We are trying to fix all these, says Saha, who is looking forward to the civic bodys suggestion of setting up smart food kiosks. Vendors have also been promised ID cards and medical insurance coverage.THE FOOD WALK*8.30am  Madan StreetOn the footpath adjoining the Hindustan Building of the Life Insurance Corporation of India, brothers Barun and Bholanath Den have just set up their breakfast stall. Sitting atop an earthen stove is a frying pan, which exchanges place occasionally with a wire mesh laden with thick slices of bread. The frying pan is for the eggs. Most office-goers demand two slices of bread with a boiled duck egg cut in half and sprinkled with salt and pepper. Those with more time on their hands often opt for a half boiled egg, cut open and smeared on the bread and covered with a drizzle of finely chopped onions.Our father set up the stall in 1978 when this was a small market for radio, transistors and their spare parts, says Barun as he shells a hens egg with the end of a teaspoon. His dexterity and speed is such that the shell comes off as a continuum. A massive flood had destroyed our village, Amta, 50 kilometres west of Calcutta, says Bholanath as he passes a piece of toast to his son, who then slathers on it much butter and sprinkles sugar.Insurance agent Chandan Bhowmick says, I leave home at 7.30am. Theres no time for anything. I eat breakfast here and wash it all down with a bhaanr of tea. The eggs and toast cost Rs 20 and the tea, Rs 5.The Den brothers feed about 700 people every day till 8pm from Monday to Saturday. By evening everything is sold out, says Barun. Nowadays we are getting orders for office picnics and from film production units, he adds proudly.E. Chandran Swami's south Indian food stall Prasun Chaudhuri*9.30am  Crossing of Princep Street and Ganesh Chandra AvenueE. Chandran Swami has been selling south Indian food at his kiosk here since 1968. I came in 1961 from Kilalkulam near Madurai. I was 14, he reminisces as he pours batter with one swift circular motion on a square tawa. He didnt learn to make idli, dosa and uttapam in Tamil Nadu. He learnt it all at a south Indian joint here. Seven years later, he set up his shop. Today, at 70, he is helped by his grandsons.Sanjoy Roy wolfs down a masala dosa (it costs Rs 50). He is a clerk employed with a private firm that deals in automobile parts. You must try his special tomato-onion uttapam, he tells us while dipping pieces of dosa in crimson chutney. You wont find this special chilli-garlic chutney anywhere in Calcutta.Chandran cooks all the food early in the morning at his rented house near New Market with the help of his wife, daughter and grandsons. He arrives at the kiosk sharp at 9am on a cycle van. He takes special care to store the coconut chutney and other perishables in ice boxes during peak summer. The cheapest item at his kiosk is a single dahi vada, which comes for Rs 17. The most expensive item on his menu is mixed cheese butter uttapam  it costs Rs 65. Of late, hes been getting a lot of contracts from school canteens.Every day, at 6pm he shuts shop, purchases a Tamil newspaper and heads for the Maidan. There, lying on the soft grass, he reads leisurely the days news. It is a stale serving this, but thats how he likes it.Rajneesh Walias foodstall Mission Dhaba Prasun Chaudhuri*2pm  Ganesh Avenue and Mangoe Lane crossingWhen we reach Rajneesh Walias foodstall Mission Dhaba, there is already a large crowd around the tandoor. About 40 people, including several cab drivers, are milling around. The plates in their hands are laden with dal makhani, chana, paneer, kulcha and pulao.Gopal Das, who drives a yellow taxi, says he lunches here at least four times a week. My order seldom changes, he says. I take half plates of chana masala, dal makhani and raita, alongside two tandoori rotis. All of it comes to Rs 60. We take a cue and place the same order. The dal makhani has a lovely smoky taste. The masala kulcha is as soft as a pillow. And the Rs 14-a-plate raita has pineapple and pomegranate in it.Rajneesh cooks the food with a couple of assistants at a small shop on Mangoe Lane. He says, My father, Surjit Singh Walia, started this 20 years ago. But this half-plate variety is my innovation.Rajneesh has started getting orders to cater for weddings and private parties. No advertising and all, he says matter-of-factly. Its mostly word-of-mouth.Bablu Kanta Ghosh has been selling Bengali sweets on the pavement near the India Coffee House for nearly 50 years now Prasun Chaudhuri*4pm  Meredith Street and Central Avenue crossingAfter a heavy lunch, its time to wrap up with some desserts. Bablu Kanta Ghosh has been selling Bengali sweets on the pavement near the India Coffee House for nearly 50 years now. I learnt my craft at a sweetmeat shop in Howrah, says Bablu. He himself hails from Haripur village in Hooghly district, 35 kilometres north of Calcutta.From Monday to Saturday, he stays at Bowbazars Chhana Patty, the hub of cottage cheese. Chhana is the basic ingredient of most Bengali sweets. Bablu prepares sweets that are not easily available at sweetmeat shops  malpua, labanga latika, bel morabba and darbesh.The bel morabba is a big hit with those who have problems with their morning constitutional.I make these myself and bring it all here in a hand-pulled cart, says Bablu. He also sells rasogolla, chhana pora, lyangcha, rasomalai and a variety of sandesh sourced from Hooghly. Sweets from Hooghly are far better than those you get in the city, he says. During winter months he sells nalen gurer sandesh and rasogolla.Sunirmal Bose, a 65-year old office peon working at a travel agents office, is one of Bablus oldest and most regular customers. I am a big fan of his malpua and labanga latika, he says. During Vijaya Dashami, I take a whole lot of these home.Every Saturday, Bablu leaves for his village. A sweet end to a mixed week."
5ce74784e8e3fc56af418596,Parading Pondy’s French connection,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/parading-pondys-french-connection/articleshow/66468118.cms,2018-11-02,,The Times Of India,"This story is from November 2, 2018Download The Times of India News App for Latest CityChennai: A man spewing fire, women in elegant gowns and bright red or gold masks covering their faces and young boys dressed up as animals  the Masquerade festival on the streets of Puducherry is a continuation of a vibrant French tradition.Celebrated four times a year on such special occasions as French Republic Day (July 14), World Peace Day (November 11), Christmas Eve and New Years Day, it provides a glimpse into the remnants of a culture that youngsters in the Union territory want to hold on to.Initially a religious entertainment event held by the French, it soon developed into a platform for the performing arts. In colonial times, only the French were allowed to take part in the dance accompanied with music. After the French left, the Creoles and Topazes did not allow the festival to be forgotten. And later the Tamils began to nurture it.The origin of the masquerade, which simply means ""an attempt to deceive people about the true nature or identity of something"", dates to the New Testament of the Bible and to the betrayal of Judas. It is believed that when the chief priests and the elders met in the palace of Caiaphas to plot the arrest of Jesus their problem was how to identify Jesus. It was Judas Iscariot, one of the 12 disciples of Jesus, who volunteered to help them. Today, the followers of Jesus put on different masks so that ""no henchman of the priests who take up arms against the ideals of Jesus would ever be able to identify them"". The wearers of masks parade themselves on the streets, symbolically braving Judas Iscariots.The masquerade, simply meaning ""putting on a mask and dancing"", also has a psychological undertone as well. It is born of the human feeling that one is safe in hiding. The speciality of this dance is that no two participants wear the same sort of masks which symbolizes that every individual has a distinct identity.In Puducherry, the masks are not just of men and women. It is like a fancy dress party where tigers, lions and dogs jostle with tomatoes, potatoes and brinjals in a merry procession. Some also go for body paint. The procession moves in step with synchronized beats of drums, pipes and timbrels giving the town a feel of a carnival. In spite of the motley group, there is a sense of celebration of the diverse community of Puducherry.(The author is a retired professor of English)"

Otherwise, not only do you lose on nutrition but there are also chances the food may turn toxic, leading to several disorders and illnesses. Lets take a closer look at the cookware used in Indian kitchens.Chopping boardMost people use a plastic one but the problem with plastic boards, even branded ones, is that chopping creates grooves that can harbour harmful microbes such as E. coli and salmonella. These germs get into cooked food via the next lot of sliced vegetables. Contamination is even more likely if the same board is used to chop meat or chicken. Worse, these bugs are so stubborn that even cooking may not kill them. Switch to wooden or rubber chopping boards and replace them every year.Aluminium utensilsBecause these vessels are oxidised, there is little chance of the aluminium leaching into food. Aluminium wrap, on the other hand, can leach metal if the food stays in it too long, especially if the dish has tomato, lemon juice or vinegar. A study in the Journal of Alzheimers Disease reported cases in which leached aluminium had led to Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases at a relatively young age. The US-based Agency for Toxic Substances and Diseases Registry (ATSDR) features aluminium prominently on its list of 200 toxic items. Switch to packing food in parchment paper. Wax-coated parchment paper is as effective as aluminium foil.Non-stick cookwareThese are extremely useful as they aid low-fat cooking and are easy to clean. The non-stick coating debuted as Teflon, which was later followed by several clones. In recent times, some of these new materials have been found to be associated with a host of diseases such as dyslexia and infertility. Improper use of these utensils compounds the problem. For instance, cooking over high heat or damaged coating can make these pans unsafe. You should use non-stick pans with great care or sparingly.Stainless steel vesselsQuality stainless steel looks good and there is barely any leaching. What there is  iron, manganese or chromium  can actually take care of possible mineral deficiencies. However, one ingredient is harmful  nickel. Dont scratch the utensil with scrubbing aids such as steelwool. A scarred surface would leach nickel.Iron woksTo me, iron pans may look ugly and, sometimes, the food you cook in it becomes black, especially if you cook sour items. But even if iron does get leached into food, its good for those who have anaemia. However, if any family member suffers from blood disorders such as polycythaemia and thalassaemia, iron in food can be harmful.PlasticwareHot food in a plastic container can get contaminated with the material, leading to heart diseases, infertility, some brain ailments and even cancer. A recent Harvard research also showed that BPA  found in certain types of plastics, especially that used to make water bottles  plays a key role in weight gain. Melamine is not as bad as plastic but it too gives off toxic substances when it comes in touch with steaming hot food. Do not use melamine containers to heat food in a microwave (even if labelled for use in microwaves).CeramicwareThis is perhaps the best cookware material. It can withstand high heat and be used in an oven, a microwave and even broiler. It is also good looking.Bone china and porcelainThese products are light and pleasing to the eyes. They can be used to heat food in the oven but are best used to serve food in. However, some porcelainware is embellished with gold or silver. Such pieces cannot be used in the microwave. The only problem: chinaware is fragile and needs careful handling.Earthenware and stonewareIn olden times, rice was cooked in earthenware. But earthenware as well as stoneware are liable to crack with sudden changes in temperature. Some people use stoneware crockery. However, you cannot use earthenware or stoneware in microwave ovens."

But even as they speak, memories of the times he spent at GM long ago come flooding back to him. Lata, meanwhile, tries to solve the blown-fuse problem before heading off to soothe Molly, whose meticulously laid plans are on the verge of unravelling.On the days that his mother worked late, Josh Sen, custodian of the plum-headed parakeets Optimus Prime and Max, would convince his dad, distinguished professor of something very important but difficult to remember, to drive by the Kharkai and Subarnarekha rivers. Not that Vikramjit needed much convincing. He loved the Marine Drive (though he would have preferred a different name, one which did not invariably occasion the patronising Oh yes, the other Marine Drive nod-and-head-bob from Bombaywallahs).Sometimes they would chat  updates about ones birds or the others students were exchanged  but, mostly, Josh would roll down the window (something his mother never allowed since the breeze interfered with her hair), stick his head out, and let the wind slap noisily against his cheeks. His father, who had grown up with dogs, delighted in his sons canine behaviour, folded up the sleeves of his Brooks Brothers shirts, and sang along to the radio. Eventually, they ended up at Brubeck, back in the city, and gorged on cakes. Tilo monitored Joshs refined sugar intake during the week strictly, but father and son had perfected the art of operating on a strict what-Tilo-doesnt-know-cant-hurt-Tilo principle.Should we check in on Pixie and her folks? Vik asked Josh that evening, after they had completed their usual run and turned towards the city again.Josh took his time to reply. He could be reflective after his drawing class.Before or after we order the cake? Josh asked finally.If we go before, we could take some cakes for them. If we go after, we could bring Pixie with us to Brubeck. And order the cake then. It all depends on how hungry you are now.Not hungry. Miss gave us lots of cookies, Josh replied. His drawing teacher was a flaky young Parsi artist who lived in one of those beautiful rambling colonial buildings and seemed to survive only on cookies and milk, which she set out before her students as she randomly showed them great works of art projected on the living room wall. The kids adored Miss Daruwalla.Dont mention the cookies to Ma though. She might give Miss...A lecture. I know. What happened to your healthy snack, by the way?Josh rummaged in his bag and extracted a little tiffin-box, in posh blue chrome, and presented to his father. Vik, who had his own chrome blue box in his bag somewhere, quickly wolfed down the cold quinoa cutlet with its side of home-made tomato relish. He could not stand quinoa and the coldness settled like an icy chrome-blue feeling in his stomach, with angry red lashings curling around it, like memories of the tomato relish. Lets go over to their guest house then and see how Pixie is settling in?Josh handed his father his water bottle, also chrome blue.Is Pixie going to be invited to my birthday? Josh sounded neutral enough.I am sure, Vik replied, allowing the water to unglue himself from that feeling, handing the bottle back to his son and starting the car. In fact, Tilo has probably already invited them. Why?She will go on and on about London. And my friends will find her lame.Now now, Vik said, accelerating the car.And then we went St James Park, and then we had tea with the Queen, Josh mimicked Pixies accent, in an accurate if cruel fashion. Maybe shell expect an Enid Blyton kind of high tea? With meringues and potted meat and ham and sardines and jam tarts.Vik narrowed his eyes and looked at his son.Josh Sen, is that what you want?Whaatt? Josh said innocently.***Several well-appointed flats, airy and central, had been turned by the company into a group of serviced apartments, which offered greater privacy to long-term residents than the old-fashioned guesthouses. A centralised hospitality desk offered luxuries such as room service and turn down (which, since shed had to pick up after everyone in London, felt like an unbelievable luxury to Nisha) and the kitchen provided food which, while not exciting, was adequate.One such apartment, off Kadma, was currently occupied by the Das Biswas-es, and its living room, with white walls, regulation sofas and severe landscapes, was currently caught in a terrific squall. Nisha was firm. The polka-dotted puppy who had been found under the mango tree must be returned to that spot. She had a toddler; she was not going to get another creature to look after; she was already at the verge of a nervous breakdown.But I am going to look after him myself, Mama, I promise, I promise, Pixie wailed. And Lisa Didi can help me. Lisa was the nanny. She lurked in the doorway and followed the war. She had fed some milk to the puppy and was on his side.Lisa Didi has her hands full. So do I. We will go back and return the puppy. I cant believe you smuggled him in when we expressly told you not to!Nishas face was thunderous. Bappa hovered around the flat  unable to take a stand  and had now decided to escape inside and call up admin to find out about the serviced apartments policy on pets.Pixie, equally firm, announced that if the puppy was going back to the mango tree, so was she. Lisa Didi, pack my bag, Pixie called out.Nisha couldnt decide what she should be madder about. The damn dog. Or her daughter ordering about Lisa so blithely.Pixie, Nisha began ominously when there were footsteps outside and the bell rang.Bappa reappeared, phone glued to his ears, and breathed a sigh of relief after he opened the door.Vikramjitda, welcome, welcome. We have a bit of a situation here. In fact, you can help! Come in please. Hello, Josh.The puppy, meanwhile, had hopped off Pixies lap and wandered towards the door.Woofwoof, he said to Josh.Woofwoof, replied Josh in return.Pixie snatched him up.I didnt know you had a dog, Josh said, as he came and sat next to her.She doesnt, Nisha said coldly. That dogs going.She forced herself to smile at Vik. Tea? Coffee? No Tilo?Having gauged the situation, Vik decided that it was better he sat. The puppy cast its soulful eyes on him. I wouldnt mind some tea, he said, But only if its no trouble. Tilo is working late today. We were going to Brubeck and thought wed take Pixie along if thats okay.Tea is no trouble, Nisha replied and made her way to the kitchen.Whats his name? Josh whispered, conspiratorially.Scone, Pixie whispered back.What? Josh narrowed his eyes exactly like his father.S-C-O-N-E, spelt out Pixie, now no longer whispering, Its pronounced scon, like don, not scone like cone.Josh digested this.Meanwhile, Scone Das Biswas had laid his little puppy head on Joshs knee. Despite his dislike for Pixie gathering up again, into a pulsating ball of annoyance, Josh couldnt help but fall a little in love with the polka-dotted creature, who wasnt a patch on his birds of course, but was, nonetheless, a delightful thing to love. He stroked his velvety ears gently. And that Pixie did not say anything to that. Instead, she looked beseechingly at her father and his friend. Soon, fat tears rolled down her cheeks one by one.***It was around 11.30 that Nisha returned to their bedroom. She was freshly showered. Though shed dried her hair, a few curls were still damp and clung to her cheeks. Postos asleep, she said and sat at the dressing table, applying cream on her cheeks.Nisha smiled at Bappa in the mirror and a load lifted off his chest.So is your daughter and that Scone. He is ensconced  or should we say en-scone-d now?  in her bed. Lisa is sitting there looking at him adoringly. I hope she still pays attention to Posto!Nisha got under the duvet and folded her body against her husbands.So your friend Vikramjit is quite the convincer. Should have gone into law!He was a famous debater baba, Bappa replied, taking her hand in his, leaning in to her. Long day, today, he said.Nishas hair smelt all coconut-y and familiar. Bappa felt himself descend into the sort of semi-comfortable space that might just develop an edge and lead to some (long, overdue) action.How much do you think professors earn at that B-school? Nisha asked him.Sorry, what? Bappa said, a little surprised at this new turn.Vikramjit and Tilottama  how much do you think they earn?Hmm, said Bappa, considering the matter.To be continued"

This will impact vegetable production after the next two-three months. The tomato prices may rise to Rs 80/kg in April next year, he said.Vilas Shinde, managing director at Sahyadri Farmers Producer Company Ltd, said, Vegetable plantations have already dipped in vegetable growing regions. Our sources in nurseries, which provide vegetable plants to farmers for planting, are reporting a 50% dip in their October orders.He said the area from Nashik to Marathwada , including Aurangabad and Jalna, may see a dip in vegetable plantation mainly, the effect of which might will become apparent as early as December. A 30% dip in vegetable produce is expected in the near future as vegetable planting has already begun dipping. Some effect on vegetable production in eastern Pune might also be seen, in locations like Indapur, Baramati and Solapur , Shinde added.Gadhave said places that do not have canal irrigation facilities were witnessing a dipping water table in October, a phenomenon which usually occurs in January. Farmers may, therefore, refrain from sowing vegetables, he said.He said most areas in the state recorded less rainfall this monsoon. It is due to this reason that Western Maharashtra, where a bulk of vegetables are grown, may also see a dip in production. No impact on potatoes, however, is expected as most of its production will happen before January 2019, he said.A state horticulture department official said the state government has declared a drought-like situation in 128 talukas, reporting trigger 2 conditions. A bulk of vegetables in the state is produced in regions with canal irrigation. However, the regions where this form of irrigation is not available may see an impact of the water scarcity , a situation which may worsen in January and February, he said.Another state horticulture department said the water situation is not that severe in major vegetable producing regions, such as Pune, Satara, Kolhapur , Sangli, Sangamner, Nashik, west Ahmednagar, which fall on the west side of the state, as the dams are full in the Western Ghat region."

However, market research department at the Tamil Nadu Agriculture University (TNAU) said tomato prices were likely to improve after the onset of northeast monsoon.A price advisory from the university attributed the drop in the prices to steady arrival of tomato to local markets from Karnataka. Once the monsoon sets in, transport of the crop from the neighbouring state might get hit and as a result tomato prices might go up in the state.Tomato is being sold at Rs 19-Rs 23 per kg in retail stores and markets, while the farm gate price is around Rs 11-Rs 13 per kg. However, maintaining and harvesting the crop is labour intensive and heavy rain had led to some spoilage, Veerappa, a farmer from Thondamuthur, said. We need at least 15 per kg to sustain ourselves.The major tomato producing districts in the state are Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri, Salem, Tiruppur, Theni and Dindigal."

Food Processing Industries Federation president P. Bhaskar Rao said Chittoor had been the leading producer of tomato in the State and had a substantial share in the national market.But, since it is a perishable commodity and the farmers and also entrepreneurs are struggling to earn minimum returns from it, the Union government has stepped in to alleviate their plight. The ODOP scheme is applicable for processing industries in food parks established by both the Central and the State governments.Tremendous scopeLike all other agriculture and horticulture crops, only about 5% of tomato is processed, which provides a tremendous scope for venturing into the business of adding value to it.Food parksMr. Rao pointed out that the Andhra Pradesh government was promoting 12 food parks with its own budget in addition to the Central government-sponsored Srini Food Park in Chittoor and Mallavalli Mega Food Park in Krishna district and the one dedicated for aquaculture namely the Godavari Mega Aqua Food Park at Bhimavaram in West Godavari district.Processing unitsIn all, 20 to 25 food parks had been sanctioned by the Centre across the country, but the State had taken the task of promoting the processing units upon itself by setting up its own parks in view of the great importance of the rich variety of crops to its economy and the livelihood of lakhs of farmers."

5ce7a0eee8e3fc56af41a735,A Star Is Born is big-feeling cinema,https://www.telegraphindia.com/entertainment/a-star-is-born-is-big-feeling-cinema/cid/1672675,2018-10-26,,Telegraph,"A Star Is Born is such a great Hollywood myth that its no wonder Hollywood keeps telling it. Whatever the era, the director or the headliners, it relates the story of two lovers on dramatically differing paths: a famous man whos furiously racing to the bottom (Bradley Cooper in this movie) and a woman (Lady Gaga) whos soaring to the top. This latest and fourth version is a gorgeous heartbreaker (bring tissues). Like its finest antecedents, it wrings tears from its romance and thrills from a steadfast belief in old-fashioned, big-feeling cinema. That its also a perverse fantasy about men, women, love and sacrifice makes it all the better.Like the last iteration, the epically (empirically!) terrible 1976 remake with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, the new one takes place in a contemporary music world that is by turns exciting, suffocating and crowded with dangers  ravenous fans, crushing performance demands, celebrity itself. This is the world that has helped create and come close to ruining Jackson Maine (Cooper), a country-rock musician who, when the movie opens, is performing obviously wasted, leaning and nearly falling into a boot-stomping song. Hes a beautiful ruin adrift on an ocean of booze, one he routinely spikes with pills.A singer with a voice that can thunder, Ally Campana (Lady Gaga) becomes Jacks safe harbour, taking on the roles of lover, partner, muse, ideal. Thats a heavy burden, but Ally is one of lifes chin-up survivors, with an errant mother and a loving, larger-than-life father, Lorenzo (a terrific Andrew Dice Clay), whose dreams cloud her own. Dad runs a limo business out of their Los Angeles home, where his male colleagues (Barry Shabaka Henley, among others) and their boisterous camaraderie fill the rooms, both warming and crowding them. Ally is accustomed to navigating around men larger than she is, elbowing past them to be seen and heard.She and Jack first meet late one night in a Hollywood drag club where she sings after her waitress shift ends. Jack has just finished playing a concert and, after polishing off a bottle of booze, has stumbled into the club for more. There he watches Ally belt out the Edith Piaf standard La Vie en Rose, in a sheath and upsweep, her arched artificial brows adding quizzical punctuation to her face. In a swoon, he invites her out that night, and, as flirtation gives way to deeper feelings, they fall in love. He brings Ally onstage and then on tour, but she eventually goes solo, becoming a star whose ascent is shadowed by his decline.Cooper, who also directed, does a lot right in this take on A Star Is Born, beginning with the casting of Lady Gaga, whose disarming, naturalistic presence is crucial to the movies force. A post-Madonna pop artiste known for her elaborate stagecraft and costumes, she has been stripped down here, her mask removed. You can see her skin, the flutter in her veins, which brings you close to her, and can make both the actress and her character feel touchingly vulnerable. This unmasking of Lady Gaga also makes Ally seem genuine, authentic, a quality that the movie champions and that serves as a kind of thematic first principle.Soon after Jack and Ally meet, he peels off one of her fake brows  hes flirting, but hes also saying that he sees the real her and wants the world to as well. Playful yet unapologetically earnest, this scene inaugurates a seduction  of Ally, of us  that lasts the exhilarating first hour. Cooper understands the power of big-screen myths, including thunderstruck love and near-magical lucky breaks. He also understands his own star appeal (he gives himself plenty of heat-stoking close-ups), which dovetails with his role as director. When Ally and Jack look at each other, youre watching two people fall in love, and its a contact high. Youre also watching a director guiding  creating  his star as life seeps into fiction.Coopers smartest decision, other than casting Lady Gaga, is the absolute sincerity with which hes taken on this material, in all its gorgeous, gaudy excess. He has refurbished the story some and added a bit too much psychological filler, but he has stayed true to its fundamental seriousness. Winking at this story would have been easy, but would have destroyed it. Instead, working from a script he wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, Cooper has gone all in with big emotions and cascades of tears. (The movie owes a debt to, and nods at, the original 1937 film as well as the 1954 remake with a peerless Judy Garland.)Part of whats exciting about this A Star Is Born is that Cooper knows hes telling one of the defining Hollywood stories and has given the movie the polish and scale it merits. He plays with intimacy and cinematic sweep, going in close when Ally and Jack are together so that the world falls away  a scene of them in a parking lot shows how conversation turns to courtship  only to then pull back so we can see the enormity of the world the lovers inhabit once Jack takes Ally on tour. And while the crowd seems little more than a surging blur the first time Jack plays, when Ally looks at the throng, she sees it and so do we.The concert scenes of Jack and Ally performing are revved up but personal. (The production borrowed crowds from actual music festivals like Coachella, and their sheer size conveys the scope of Jacks stardom.) Cooper sings pleasantly enough and throttles an electric guitar with persuasive fervour. Hes backed by the group Lukas Nelson & the Promise of the Real (Lukass dad is Willie Nelson). The music mixes standards with new songs, some written by Cooper, Lukas Nelson and Lady Gaga, whose supple, often electric singing can, at full throttle, express intensities of feeling far better than the dialogue.Like many filmmakers, Cooper sometimes explains too much. It isnt enough that Jack drinks; Cooper wants us to know why. So, he fleshes out Jacks past, turning melodrama into therapy and robbing the character of mystery. One of the weakest scenes, a violent confrontation between Jack and his much-older brother, Bobby (Sam Elliott, whose deep drawl Cooper has borrowed), is an information dump. In one of the finest, Bobby just wordlessly drives away from Jack, and Elliott lets you see the ferocity of the brothers love - and their pain - in eyes that have begun to water and in a stone face that will shatter.Cooper spends more time on the storys male lead than previous iterations have, perhaps because hes taken the role himself. The focus on Jack  he scrapes bottom, goes into recovery  somewhat weighs down the remainder of the movie, partly because too much of it is overly familiar. At times, Cooper seems to share Jacks unease with Allys stardom, particularly after she connects with a manager (Rafi Gavron, oozing sleaze) and transforms from a soulful crooner into a writhing automaton with soulless beats and backup singers. Ally puts on the mask that Cooper has removed from Lady Gaga, suggesting that  unlike Jacks  her art is less than pure.Male self-aggrandisement is baked into the storys foundation but not ruinously. Jack doesnt just help turn Ally into a star, giving her the big break she needs. His trauma  shes insecure, but hes damaged  becomes a deep well that she draws from, allowing her to become a greater artist. In part, the story is as creaky as that of Pygmalion, the male sculptor who turns a beloved carving into a woman. Yet one of the pleasures of A Star Is Born in all its renditions is that it is also about a woman whose ambitions are equal to those of any man and who steadily rises as she weeps and sings toward fabulous self and sovereignty."

We are already No.1 in the country in papaya, mango, banana and chilli crops and will soon become a horticultural hub, he said.Recalling the upheaval among farmers due to the glut and the resultant lack of remunerative prices for mango, turmeric, chilli, jowar and maize in the last few years, he emphasised on looking beyond the traditional farming practices and embrace new technologies both to cut down cost and overcome the vagaries of monsoon.The amount spent towards market intervention fund by this government in the last four years is Rs. 3,800 crore against the paltry Rs. 340 crore spent by the previous government during 2009-14 for the combined State, he pointed out.Dig at CentreThe State government did go the extra mile by increasing the quantum of support during disasters, he said and flayed the Centre for remaining nonchalant. We tripled the quantum of support for the 4.7 lakh coconut trees uprooted in Uttarandhra region during the recent Titli cyclone, without waiting for the Centre. It is always the State government that is answerable to the people."

The company, which already has brands like Sugar Free and Nutralite, the addition of Complan and Glucon-D, is expected to strengthen its equity in the consumer wellness segment.

Nineteen schools in Kozhikode are also part of Sanjeevani.Organic seedsAs part of the programme, differently abled children will sow organic seeds and nurture them. The project had begun as initiatives of the district missions in Malappuram and Thiruvananthapuram and is now being expanded Statewide.In Malappuram, the project began as Thalir in 15 schools in August last year. This year, it has been scaled up to cover seven more schools. Growbags, compost, and seeds are given to the Buds schools for children to cultivate.The children plant seeds of ladys finger, tomato, brinjal, long beans, chilli, and other seeds; water them; remove weeds; and harvest the produce with the support of their teachers, parents, and Kudumbashrees joint liability groups.The project was inspired by the tapioca yield in a few schools. It was then decided to start organic cultivation of other crops as an activity for the children to keep them active, and bring them close to nature, Mr. Haskar says.At the Cherukavu Buds school, the Kudumbashree has introduced a form of drip irrigation using PVC pipes that ensures that all the plants are watered using less water and the children are not taxed much either. This year, at Kondotty, they are growing plants in 40 growbags on garden stands besides on a plot of land.Mr. Haskar says vegetable cultivation is an activity that could be done even at home once the children get a hang of it. Completing various jobs such as watering plants or removing weeds helps develop their concentration. It could even evolve into a source of livelihood for them in future.Besides growbag cultivation in Alappuzha, Idukki and Kozhikode, farming is being done by children in two cents or more of land near the Buds schools. In total, 345 cents of land is under vegetable farming.The maximum area under cultivation is in Kollam-68 cents, Mr. Haskar says. Thrissur followes with 64 cents, while Malappuram has 50 cents."

On the sidelines of the launch of the new season of her audio chat show #NoFilterNeha on Saavn, t2 chatted with the actress about cravings, maternity leave and the #MeToo movement.What an incredible year youre having, both professionally and personally. Hows the pregnancy treating you?Very well, in fact. I always wondered, What will I do when I get pregnant? and now that I am pregnant, I am doing exactly what Ive been doing throughout  I am working, I am exercising and socialising. Every pregnancy is different. If there are women who want to stay home through their pregnancy, I respect that. If there are women who want to go out there and work, Id tell them to get up and do it.Everyone whos pregnant has talked about weird cravings. Have you had any?Yes. In my first trimester, I was doing Roadies. I was living in a tent and Id be craving raw tomatoes with lime and salt. In my second trimester, I only wanted bhindi and roti, and this is my third trimester and I want to each chicken and rice all the time. I am talking to you but all I can think of is when Ill get to eat chicken and rice! (Laughs) The only things I have had to give up are eggs and chocolate.Between your husband Angad Bedi and you, whos reading all the baby books?Neither of us. We will be the kind of parents who will take each day as it comes. We dont have a single parenting book or have enrolled for any classes. I am in my eighth month and my doctor has told me to continue doing what I am doing. The idea is not to change my daily routine too much. My mom keeps telling me, If you are strong enough to give life, then get up and do the work you want to do.Have you been getting a ton of advice from people?Yeah and its very boring and I dont want it. Please dont give me advice. People are constantly trying to tell me if I am having a boy or a girl. I am told if my stomach is a certain shape, it means its a boy or a girl. And really, I am not interested.This is the third season of your show and you have Angad as a guest. What was it like to interview your husband?Thats a big one for me. It made me nervous. In the previous years, interviewing Karan (Johar) always made me nervous because he is a talk show host but this year, talking to Angad was nerve-wracking. When you are talking to your husband, you dont know where to draw the line and thats exactly what happened when we were recording. We ended up talking for two hours!Youve always talked about Shah Rukh Khan being a dream guest. Would he be on the show this year?Unfortunately not! We were in conversation but hes not doing interviews right now, so I guess next time.Over the three seasons, apart from Karan Johar, whos been your favourite guest and why?Every year theres one guest who surprises me. My biggest surprise this year has been Harbhajan Singh because hes literally done a lot of spin bowling in the comments that he made. And then last year, it was Rishi Kapoor who I was very fascinated with. Apart from Karan, the one guest who cracked me up the most was Farah Khan.You do audio, youre on television, you also act in films  is there a medium that has your heart?This ones very, very close because I am a producer and the host. Donning many different hats makes me feel like I have achieved a lot at the end of one season. But nothing gives me as much satisfaction as making a film. I have Helicopter Eela thats released recently and which I am very excited about.We (Neha and husband Angad Bedi) will be the kind of parents who will take each day as it comes. We dont have a single parenting book or have enrolled for any classes (Agencies)Are you are planning a maternity break after this?Errrr I dont know. I am hoping to keep working until the last day. And then I bring a new life into this world and then get back to work as soon as I can. Again, I dont think there is any such thing as a bad parent; one that gets back to work is just as amazing as the one who stays at home to nurture. I dont know which one of these Id be.Keira Knightley recently wrote an essay about pregnancy and the pressures that society puts on women to look perfect immediately after birth. In the past there has been a lot of scrutiny on Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Kareena Kapoor Khan regarding their post-baby bodiesShame on people who fat-shame new mothers. The most important thing for me is that I am feeling healthy. Will I get disturbed with peoples opinion on my body after I deliver my child? I dont know.There is always pressure on us in the public eye. But I also know that the first couple of months after a woman gives birth, her life is turned upside down. You feel like a wreck and if you look like one, its totally okay. This is the most beautiful time in a mothers life and how you look or dont should be the least of your worries. I hope that I can remind myself this every day. And if I forget, then my mother or husband remind me because their opinion matters the most in my life.Is Bollywoods #MeToo movement a long time coming?Of course. We need to clean up the industry. It makes me very angry that people are questioning the women who are coming forward. At the same time, I am very happy that women are talking. It takes a lot of courage. You cannot turn a blind eye when someone comes forward. When someone shares their story, you have to support them, no matter what. Whether I bring  a daughter or a son  into this world, Id want to teach them these right values."
