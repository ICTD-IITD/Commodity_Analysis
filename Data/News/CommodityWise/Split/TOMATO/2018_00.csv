5a53b3e09855b770e038277e,Horticulture crop output seen at record 305.4 mt in 2017-18,http://www.livemint.com/Politics/V7EcEZlz9jT3bjLsyoiSpK/Horticulture-crop-output-seen-at-record-3054-mt-in-201718.html,2018-01-02,,Livemint,"Within horticulture, production of vegetables is estimated at 181 mt in 2017-18, about 1% higher than the year before, while that of fruits is estimated at 95 mt, 2% higher than the previous year. Photo: Indranil Bhoumik/MintNew Delhi: Production of horticulture crops like vegetables and fruits is likely to touch a record 305.4 million tonnes (mt) in 2017-18, about 1.6% higher than the previous year and 8% higher than the previous five years average, the agriculture ministry said in its first advance estimates released on Tuesday.The final estimates for 2016-17 released alongside showed that production of these perishable crops was 300.6 mt, a year-on-year rise of over 5%.Within horticulture, production of vegetables is estimated at 181 mt in 2017-18, about 1% higher than the year before, while that of fruits is estimated at 95 mt, 2% higher than the previous year.Data showed that during the year, area under different perishable crops stood at 24.9 million hectares, about 0.3% higher than the year before. Between 2015-16 and 2017-18, productivity of horticulture crops rose from 11.7 tonnes per hectare to an estimated 12.3 tonnes per hectare.Disaggregated data on estimates of production of specific crops showed onions at 21.4 mt, about 4.5% lower than the year before, and potatoes at 49.3 mt, marginally higher than the 48.6 mt in 2016-17. Production of tomatoes is estimated to rise 7.7% year-on-year in 2017-18 to 22.3 mt, showed the data.The record production during 2017-18 will mark the sixth straight year of horticulture production outstripping that of foodgrains (estimated at 276mt in 2016-17), suggesting a structural change in Indian agriculture where farmers are increasingly growing perishable commercial crops due to a growing market and a quicker cash flow as these crops require less time from sowing to marketing.However, price volatility continues to be a major risk in horticulture, with prices of onions, tomatoes and potatoes plunging below growing costs several times last year. While farmers in Madhya Pradesh were forced to sell onions as low as Rs2 per kg in June last year, in northern India, farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were forced to dump their potato crop for want of buyers around the same time.Retail and wholesale prices of perishables are also at a large variance from each other, implying fragmented markets and poor cold chain facilities. For instance, while tomatoes are currently selling for as low as Rs2-4 per kg in wholesale markets in Andhra Pradesh, they are retailing at Rs35 per kg in Delhi."
5a581ffe9855b770e038337c,Over 100 years of whisking away B’lureans,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2018/jan/10/over-100-years-of-whisking-away-blureans-1750276.html,2018-01-11,,The New Indian Express,"BENGALURU: For anyone who has grown up in Bengaluru, before the mushrooming of various bakery chains and outlets, the iconic Iyengar bakeries, found around every street corner, were go-to spots for the softest sponge cakes, fresh buns and crispy puffs. The heady aroma of bread being brought out of the oven would envelop the entire locality, a smell that takes many back to carefree childhood days.Over the years, people have moved on to fancier bakeries, but those loyal to Iyengar bakeries, some of which have crossed the 100-year mark, continue to be customers, sometimes traveling far off to their favourite one, or waking up in the wee hours to get a fresh batch of buns.Bakeries places to socialise in Colonial timesCity-based historian Arun Prasad says that the art of baking dates back to the time of the Roman Empire, and was eventually popularised by the British, who took the art to the countries they colonized. In Colonial times, bakeries were primarily spaces to socialize, he says.British army officers brought cakes and cookies from England to India. Though it is hard to trace the exact history, it is certain that it was the Iyengar community, who learnt baking from the British, that brought bakeries to the city, and these became popular for their high quality, hygeinic food, says Prasad.2)Owner of BB Bakery with fresh vegetable toast3)Oldest Iyengar Bakery in city, BB Bakery, Kengeri4) Sreenivas with his wife at the bakery5)Chocolate chip cookies fresh out of oven at BB BakeryHe says that these Tamil-speaking Iyengars travelled to different parts from the Hassan district  one theory is that they came looking for jobs, the other is that there was a draught that forced them to relocate. This sect of Iyengars are called Hebbar Iyengars, and were followers of Ramanujam. They were also referred to as Ashtangrama Iyengars, owing to the fact that they were from eight different villages within the Hassan district. Though the period of migration is uncertain, it is known that these Iyengars were employed by the British for various jobs  some in administrative posts, others as helpers on private estates, which is how they learnt how to bake. Despite being a vegetarian community, they started using egg for baking purposes.After the 1950s, Iyengar bakeries became popular throughout the city, and the community became known as bakery Iyengars or bread Iyengars. However, several other people, outside the community, opened up these bakeries by banking on the same name, says Prasad.First Iyengar bakery in city estd in 1898Prasad says that there was a theory that the first Iyengar bakery in the city was started in the 1890s by a family from Hassan, and was a sweet shop before it became a bakery.Shedding some light on this is Pavithra, whose father, Sreenivas, runs BB Bakery, apparently the first Iyengar bakery in the city, started in 1898. Pavithra says that her great grandfather Thirumalachar, ran a sweet shop in Chikpet, and was taught how to bake bread by a British man, whose name is unknown. After buns, Thirumalachar started selling bread and cakes too.My father was never inclined towards studies, and despite his fathers hesitance towards him joining the business, he decided to take over, and I plan on carrying on the legacy after him, says Pavithra, adding that the buns are their most popular item till date, as their size and taste make them very unique and sought after.Though BB Bakery moved out of its old home in Chikpet, due to issues with the owner, and has relocated to Kengeri now, Pavithra says that loyal customers, some of whom have been visiting for the last 50 years, still come all the way. She says her father wakes up at 5am everyday, at his age, to ensure his customers get fresh buns. Despite him not being keen on his three daughters taking over, they dont want the over-a-century-old family business to die out.6)Hot and crispy vegetable puffs at BB Bakery7) Famous bun-butter-jam at Iyengar Bakery, Austin Town8)Sreenivas stacking baked goods at BB Bakery9)Freshly baked buns at Iyengars Bakery, Austin Town10) Loaves of bread at Iyengars Bakery, Austin TownWay forwardPavithra says that business has changed over the years. Earlier, people would pick up in bulk, but now, its become on a more day-to-day basis, where people pick up just what they need for that day.My father keeps experimenting and innovating now to keep the products selling. The tomato bun, pudina bun, kaju khara, choco-gems cookies and choco-strawberry cookies are newer items, and they have been doing well. My father just wants to keep his customers satisfied, she says, adding that to keep up with the times, her younger sister has started a Facebook page and rebranded the bakery with a new logo too.Raman and Lakshmeesha, brothers to run Iyengars Bakery in Austin Town, say that their father started the bakery back in 1981. The baked good they are known for are bun-butter-jam, plain cakes and nippat.We sell 250 products, from buns to namkeen to cakes. We have started online orders, and are the only Iyengar bakery that is doing this. But we have noticed that these days, people are picking up goods just for their daily requirements.Nostalgia all the wayFor Ruth Dsouza Prabhu, a food writer, her earliest memories of Iyengar bakeries go back to when she first moved here to work, about 18 years back. I would go to the closest Iyengar bakery before work for breakfast and pick up an aloo bun or a khaara bun, which is filled with a spicy mix of vegetables, and this would keep me satisfied for quite some time. The plain cakes are something I still pick up, and my daughter, who is extremely fussy about her food, tried this one first and that is how she took to eating cake  so I am thankful to Iyengar bakeries for this, she says.Prakash, 63, has lived in Bengaluru almost all his life, and Iyengar bakeries are part of his childhood in the city. As kids, we would go to the bakery and buy cream buns with the little pocket money we got  this was after school when all the neighbourhood boys would get together to play. Even now, some of my friends and I gather here in the evenings, some even bring their grandkids. But we dont eat cream buns anymore, he says laughing.Fakers stay awayOver the years, some people have started Iyengar bakeries without actually belonging to the community, which has resulted in legal issues. Raman says, People who arent from the community are using the name just to make their bakeries popular, they are not authentic. However, those who know which the authentic bakeries are, make sure they go only to the original ones, he says, adding that his only request to customers is to go to authentic Iyengar bakeries, and not take the others at face value."

Emotional abuse negatively affects a childs emotional development and is caused by withholding love or support for a child.In a survey, 36 per cent of Indian parents agreed to hit children as a form of punishment. 64 per cent of Asian (2-7 years) children are known to experience moderate to severe forms of abuse.Why is it a burden?Childhood abuse results in severe physical injuries, disabilities, poor cognitive and socio-emotional outcomes, behavioural problems, mental health issues throughout life and may lead to fatal outcome. Even mild forms of abuse pose children at risk of re-experiencing abuse. It is possible that it can evoke insecurity in a child.Neuroscientists who conducted brain imaging studies of children with history of abuse, have demonstrated long term abnormal brain changes in the areas related to emotion, motivation, attention and executive functions. Thus, quality of the relationship established in earlier life plays a fundamental role in development of social relationships and emotional regulation in later life.How can parents help?Support the child  Try to correct parent-child relationship, which in turn can prevent re-abuse, reduces parent-child conflict and reduces parental stress. This will improve family dynamics thus reducing child behavioural problems.Positive parenting - Understand right techniques to discipline your child rather than using physical means of punishment. Use of positive parenting skills which include positive reinforcement of child, trust building activities and spending quality time with the child are essential. In adolescents, it is a greater challenge as they frequently have lack of faith in the ability of family to help them handle aftermath of disclosure of abuse.Do not blame the child  Children who go through emotional abuse frequently give in to bribing or befriending the abuser due to fear of disclosure or guilt of being abused. Blaming the child will lead to double victimisation of the child, both by abuser and family.Be aware  Understanding a childs social network is very essential. Parents also have to be aware of online communication platforms that are now emerging as rampant forms of emotional abuse and exploitation of children and adolescents (eg Blue Whale app).Seek help  Children often use different ways to express when exposed to abuse including sudden onset school refusal, mood disturbances, aggression, sadness, anger outbursts, social withdrawal and acute decline in school performance. Look out for these symptoms early and seek professional help.Keep stigma away  Parents should keep stigma away when they identify need for support from a mental health professional. Parents should help the child regain their confidence. If the offender belongs to the family, measures to avoid repeated abuse should be taken.Provide good social support - It is very essential to develop good social support network that include parents, extended family, peers, teachers and professionals, as an abuse tends to create greater chance of a child or adolescent manifesting a psychiatric symptomatology later in life.

As the price for the day is announced disappointment is writ large on his face. At Rs80 per crate of 15kg, Tomato is threatening to bring tears in the eyes in this poll season for the farmers in this drought prone district.Good showers last monsoon had brought cheers for the farmers who had suffered consecutive years of drought. ""We can make some profit only if the price of tomato crosses Rs150 per crate and the price today will leave me incurring loss. With more farmers set to bring their produce to the market in the coming days I am really worried about the grim future. The price could fall below Rs50 per crate. It will be a disaster,"" adds Vishwanath Reddy, a tomato grower from Mangasandra village in Kolar.The familiar scene of farmers dumping their tomato produce on the roads as a mark of protest is likely to repeat, says Santosh, a tomato merchant who supplies tomatos from Kolar to not only places like Chennai, Kolkata, Rajasthan and other parts of the country, but even exports to Quatar and Pakistan. ""We are sending over 300 to 400 crates every day now to Quatar and Pakistan,"" claims Santosh.A perennially drought prone district, Kolar has carved a niche for itself in horticulture. The district is the main supplier of Mango and vegetables like tomato, cabbage, cauliflower and beans.We have been let down by our leadersWhile the tomato tale of tears is a recurring feature, the farmers of Kolar curse the failure of their leaders for letting them down in redressing their problem. ""We had agriculture ministers like C Byre Gowda, Srinivasa Gowda and now Krishna Byre Gowda from our own district, but without finding a lasting solution for our woes whether in getting water for our crops or ensuring a fair price and market for our produce,"" says Chandrappa who has branched out to sericulture apart from his tomato farming.Known as the district of 'Silk and Milk' for its strides in sericulture and dairy farming, the people are waking up for the electoral heat with their demands.""Setting up cold storage chains to store farm produce during the time of price crash, setting up agro-processing industries, speeding up projects like Yettinahole and Yarragolu ti bring water, giving push for industrial growth in the region,' tops our wish, says Chandrappa of Mudavadi village.The villages are already seeing the divide as the May 12 assembly election is approaching. In Mangasandra with a population of about 1000, the divide is clear between Above Poverty Line(APL) and Below Poverty Line(BPL) families and also caste divide between Vokkaliga, Kuruba,SC/ST and Minority communities. The Kolar constituency is witnessing tough fight between former agriculture minister Srinivasa Gowda of JD(S) and Syed Zameer Pasha of Congress. The Kuruba, SC/ST and Minority population is showing greater preference for Congress while the Vokkaliga and Reddy communities along with a few OBC castes are consolidating behind Srinivasa Gowda. While Om Shakti Chalapathy of BJP too is giving a fight, incumbent MLA Varthur Prakash of Namma Congress is determined to have the last laugh against his opponents from three bigger parties.While the BPL families are generally appreciative of Siddaramaiah government's welfare programmes, the APL families are miffed as they are not getting 30kg rice at concessional price of Rs10.Farming sustains the livelihood of about 60% of the population of the villagers, sericulture and dairy farming are drawing a large segment with hope of more steady income.Rain hits sweet dreams of Mango growersThe recent spell of rains and gale wings has hit the mango growers of Kolar and Srinivasapura. ""We had suffered due to a spell of untimely rains during the flowering season of mango. Just a couple of weeks back the fresh spell of rain and gusty winds has hit the crop,"" rues Chandrappa, a mango farmer in Srinivasapura.""Our yield is likely to go down by 30%. Now we are keeping our fingers crossed about the price we get,"" Chandrappa adds.Srinivasapura, the mango hub of the region is equally well known for its fierce political battle between Health Minister Ramesh Kumar and his arch rival Venkatashiva Reddy. The constituency has never seen its MLA score a repeat victory. It is always alternative terms for Ramesh Kumar and Venkatashiva Reddy here. Will Ramesh Kumar break the sequenced and humble Reddy again is the question that is being hotly debated in the constituency."

Your garden requires food and water. But,above all, it requires your love and affection, like your child, says 62-year-old PV Ramanna from Hyderabad. He started gardening in 1998. In the last 20 years, he has developed a number of hybrid plants over an area of 1,500 sq ft. He says, Gardening has been my hobby since childhood. When I used to work at ISCO fertilisers, I did not get much time to take care of my garden, but post-retirement, Im a full-fledged gardener. I could not be more content.His interests lies mainly in developing hybrid varieties of flowers. Lotus, jasmine, hibiscus, frangipani and lily plants have occupied a considerable space in his garden. He explains that flowers come in different shapes, sizes and hues. They are not just visually appealing, but enhance your mood too. A flower garden can be developed even by a novice with zero investment, he says. Apart from this, he has also developed an organic garden with vegetables and fruits.Vegetables include tomatoes, green chilies, lady fingers, eggplant and drumstick. He says, Planting a single tomato plant can give you 4 kgs of tomatoes in one entire season. By planting these in pots, you enjoy the pleasure of savouring delicious, sun-warmed vegetables fresh from your garden. Moreover, you dont have to go to the grocery store each time. Just pick the right spot, make sure the soil bed is not weed-ridden and there is plenty of sunlight.Mango, strawberry, pomegranate, banana, sapota are some of the fruits he grows. He makes sure the soil is free from pesticides and occasionally removes unwanted weeds. He has been using kitchen waste, dried leaves and cow dung to make compost. He spends around three hours in the morning and evening to water the garden. He has designed a rooftop water harvesting process that stores rainwater to water the plants, especially when there is water scarcity in the city.On his terrace garden, one can find a plethora of potted plants and birds. The potted plants are placed on a raised cemented platform. He says, Usually, the potted plants are placed on the terrace slab. The water draining out of these pots is wasted. I have designed cemented pots in such a way that the excess water flows into miniature tubs. Birds such as pigeons, crows, bulbuls and koels come here for their early morning bath. It is very pleasing and soothing to watch them, and the birds also stay hydrated during the scorching heat.The list does not end here. Ramanna also owns around eight aquariums with varieties of fish, including ten types of different coloured shrimp. He says that a garden is a major source of stress relief. He, along with his wife Uma Ramanna, are working together to promote the importance of plants in theirneighbourhood."

And Prema mami has a specific mission too. People should know that there is lot to offer in vegetarian Tamil cuisine, too,she says.Premas husband is also a chef. He used to work as a senior chef at a five-star hotel in Dubai. My husbands way of thinking is different from mine. I focus more on the homemade traditional recipes but I also like cooking North Indian and Chinese items, says Prema. Her daughters too draw inspiration from their mothers cooking, and continue to experiment interesting varieties on a daily basis, with her inputs.Prema cooked her first dish, the humble onion uthappam, when she was 10. For the last four years, Prema has been catering food in the US, and in Muscat for three years. Recollecting these experiences, Prema shares, Cooking for international crowd was special. They love homemade food. So they crave for anything fresh and not preheated.

The spread of 26 varieties starts with panagam (a summer health drink) and has a blend of variety rice, kuzhambu (curries), poriyal (vegetables), sweets like godhumai halwa (wheat), and wraps up with neer mor (buttermilk). We come during vacations to ensure that kids get a taste of these forgotten Tamil vegetarian recipes. Its not often that we make kodamilagai thayir pachadi (capsicum and curd salad) or kathirikai (brinjal) podi curry.

But meet Naina Siwach from Mumbai, who by her own confession, is a digital nomad. Planning, she says, is the key to making your travel dreams come true. In her 30s now, this former VP of a national PR company in Mumbai who is now 'location independent' and has chosen to become a consultant digital strategist and moved to Bali, Indonesia, in December 2017 as she feels the new job will help her travel yet work for a living. While many of us got inspired to spend at least two days at the La Tomatina Festival after watching Laila and Arjun fall in love with each other amidst the squishy tomatoes in Spain in the epic 2011 Bollywood movie Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, this girl actually managed to ring in her 30th birthday in Spain at the fest. ""Ever since I turned 21, I've managed to visit more than 30 countries and I hope to have 50 stampings in my passport before I turn 40."" she says. Naina was at The Philippines for her birthday in 2017 and she says she loves to do it the local style. Her holidays are dotted with archery, height ziplining, surfing, snorkeling, deep sea diving and more. She loves to hang out with the locals, eat like them and even rent a little studio apartment for herself when she travels. We ask her how she manages to do all of this and how to plan to explore the world. Excerpts from a conversation with this true blue nomadWhen did you start travelling solo?I ventured on my first solo travel at the rebellious age of 18, as a birthday gift to myself. I yearned to step out of my comfort zone and explore unchartered territories. The first trip was to Europe where I travelled for 30 days and it felt like the best 30 days of my life. Every day, I learnt the value of being true to myself and appreciating my moments of solitude. It changed me as a person and restored a newfound sense of independence within me. I understood how to adapt to different cultures, cuisines, languages and of course, money conversions most importantly. Every solo trip has enhanced the quality of my peace and happiness.What is it in solo travel that keeps you going again and again?Every solo trip has helped me grow and evolve as a person. It is an ideal stress buster and enables me to truly appreciate the value of my freedom and Independence and to be a better human being. It fills my soul with tranquillity. It is what I do to recover from life's many unpredictable blows, so I may refresh and rejuvenate myself and go back to face anything that comes my way with renewed energy. In a land where you meet new people, you realise you a mere speck in this vast diverse world. Taking yearly solo trips has been essential in teaching me to expand my boundaries and help me take a step back in my own life to appreciate the things I have been blessed with.How does one realise their dream of travelling the world while still holding a fulltime (often demanding) job?First earn well and save well ( a few lakhs in Indian Rupee to take care of emergencies). Then choose a job which allows you to work remotely. With the advent of mobile technology and superfast broadband and many companies also giving the remote work options, it is easier to find jobs in the new age economy. For instance, I was previously based in Mumbai and used to work fulltime as the Vice President of the luxury segment of a PR company. But now, thanks to my quest for travel, I travel wherever I want but to using my high end laptop and a super fast internet connection (luckily Bali has a good one), I work as a digital strategist for global brands. My work involves planning digital campaigns and promotions. So if your travel quest gets the better of you, this is the best way to go about life and your dreams.What are the three tips for Indian solo travellers to stay safe?During one of my solo trips to Amsterdam a few years ago, I recall feeling completely vulnerable and alone. Nonetheless, I decided to step outside my hostel and check out their famous Dutch apple pie cafe. My recommendation would be to step out of your fear zone and explore the city and trust me, this will redefine your definition of freedom. You can thank me later. The hacks that keep me safe or sorted are:- To blend in and dress like one of the locals.- Carry a dummy wallet. I keep my money and cards in my inner garments. So in case, anyone attempts to rob you, only the dummy wallet is lost.- Pepper spray is not allowed in air travel. So you can carry a mosquito spray or miniature hair spray if possible. That works too, in case of emergency to at least stump the intruder.- Pick Airbnb and hostels that have maximum reviews and are centrally located.- It is preferable to leave the DND sign on your door before leaving the hotel room.- Do not trust people easily. Stay alert and vigilant.Is there any process you follow on how you decide your next destination?Birthdays are special days and I want the best stuff those days. So for the last five years, I have made a pact to myself - to break boundaries and travel far and wide. As an avid traveller who uses almost every long weekend for some sort of travel (I started 2018 with the Thrissur Snake Boat Race festival), I have several exotic and unexplored destinations to discover. I am a thalassophile - a sea lover. The ebb and tide of the waves lull me into a new world whenever I play on the beach. So naturally, my travel is research-oriented and usually around beaches. I am an adventure freak so activities such surfing, diving and snorkelling with intriguing culture blends interest me. I celebrated my birthday in Balinese tradition in 2017.Share three travel hacks.Ans: Always make sure to inform your bank about the country you intend to visit along with the duration. Make sure you are familiar with the conversions and costs. Keep the emergency number of the bank in handy in case you lose your cards without fail.What are the destinations in your bucket list?There are three destinations and experiences I wish to complete before 2020 which are as follows:- I want to attempt the Lava Surf in Hawaii. It is said to be extremely dangerous, however, I wish to experience the thrill to ride waves on fire!- I want to walk through the magnificent Amazon rainforest. The starting point would be from Bolivia. This is an experience of a lifetime and I would recommend the same to all the solo travellers across the world.- I would like to travel across Japan for about four months during the Cherry blossom season. It begins to bloom in Okinawa, passes through the middle of Japan and finishes with a late bloom in northern Hokkaido.Ideally how much budget should a single Indian set aside for a week's travel abroad.. not too much luxury but not too much of a shoestring.. economy.It would depend on the destination. I wouldnt recommend Europe or USA for a week. The tickets are expensive and to justify that cost, you need to spend at least two to three weeks. If you want to go abroad for a week, I would recommend The Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand Islands, Cambodia and Vietnam. You can work within Rs 1.5 lakh including tickets, visa, stay, meal and intercity travel. If you are a shopaholic, then I recommend you downsize your credit limit to 50K so you dont splurge. However, avoid malls. Always visit flea markets and vintage storesWhat websites/ apps to plan your travel do you recommend?- TripIt - saves my travel itinerary, while the alerts are like my best travel buddies.- Airbnb for homestay.- Hostel World for any hostel bookings.- CityMapper - for any help in understanding local transport.- Google translate are my Go to apps as required.Any tips on snagging the best foreign travel dealsPlan in advance.

He has played host on Masterchef India and Junior Masterchef India and was invited to judge the semi-finale of Masterchef America with Chef Gordon Ramsey. He has been honoured with Dr. S Radhakrishnan National Media Network Award. The Indian Television Academy awarded him for the Best Jury/Anchor on television for Junior Masterchef India. Kapur is also the proud recipient of the prestigious Sir Edmund Hillary Fellowship 2012 from the Government of New Zealand in the field of Food & Beverage and has authored many cookbooks.Hometown: New DelhiEducation: Kapur studied at St Francis De Sales School in New Delhi and is an alumnus of Institute of Hotel Management (IHM), Sector 42, Chandigarh.My Chandigarh connect: I studied hotel management in the city and was a student here from 1997 to 2000 when I graduated. Over the last few years, my work has brought me to the city often.My area of expertise: Having worked with some of the leading hotel chains like the Taj Group of Hotels and The Leela group, I specialise in Indian cuisines and, in recent years, in food research. I am also a passionate photographer and gardener.My secret to success: There are many things that make a person successful and there are a lot of people involved in ones journey. It starts as early as school and college with our teachers. So has been the case with me, but when I look back I think my travels in India and around the world have really been key to my success as a chef. Travel helped me embrace not just all kinds of food but also different people and cultures.The turning point: For me, the turning point came when I actually started loving what I do. Let me explain why I say this. Initially, my life was very hectic. I would work long hours and weekends. At that point, I started comparing myself with people who would have weekends off or had more time on their hands. Then one day I accepted that this was how it was going to be. The day I accepted it, things changed. I started to enjoy what I do.What I owe to Chandigarh: My stay in Chandigarh was my first time away from home. My parents were initially very apprehensive. But when I came here, I didnt feel out of place. I saw how people bonded with each other. Every festival  be it Lohri, Diwali, Holi  it would be a community affair. I imbibed this community spirit. Chandigarh helped me hone my tastebuds, especially when it came to kebabs and curries. As young students we survived on humble meals that cost as little as Rs 10 and this included unlimited rotis. It taught me humility. I also learnt to appreciate the simplicity of meals and the essence of Punjabi khaana (food) here.Things I like to do when I visit Chandigarh: I always look forward to eating out when I am here. As students, our favourite haunt was the Sector 34 market. I remember a small little takeaway joint here called Chaplin. I love visiting the place when I am in Chandigarh. It brings back memories of college days. We relished all meals here including the speciality - tomato paneer. The owner knew we lived on a budget and would always give a little extra portion, including complimentary salad. I have been hooked to the place ever since my first year of college.How has the city changed over the years: I think not just cities but people change as well. Its progression. I think over the years, I have become better and my Institute has become better too. But I must say I hate how the roundabouts now have traffic signals. I still love Sukhna Lake even though it is overcrowded. I think the city has evolved but maintained an old world charm.The change I would want to see in the city: I come from Delhi and over there I see a disconnect between people and those who run it. I want the residents of Chandigarh and the people who manage it to have a better bonding. I feel it is important for a city to move forward together. I would like Chandigarh to maintain its identity and be a better city not just with regard to infrastructure but in arts as well. I remember reading how Le Corbusier emphasised art and I think efforts should be made to keep it alive.The secret of success in the hospitality industry: I always tell people who are keen about a career in hospitality or are pursuing hotel management to laugh out loud and sometimes laugh at yourself. It is a very stressful environment to work in. Its equally important to put your head down and learn. Youngsters shouldnt worry about the money. It is more important to get the skill right, the money will follow."

Divyas journey into baking and satisfying the sweet tooth of Chennaiites began as a hobby after becoming a mother. We were in Goa. After I had my daughter, I wasnt doing much apart from taking care of her. There was a bread bakery next door and that got me interested in baking, she recalls. Eventually, she began baking breads.Gradually she started making drool-worthy cakes, pastries, quiches and pies. Initially, I was into bread baking. From garlic to milk bread, I used to do it all, she beams. Her biggest breakthrough was when her baked goodies were sold in Sandys, and Ox and Tomato, two famous restaurants in the city. Until then I was baking only for my family and close friends. After my bakes made it to the shelves of two popular restaurants in the city, I began getting orders from people who had become fans of my dishes, she says.The textile designer specialises in wedding cakes, French macrons, and hand-frosted /hand-painted cookies and cakes. I am a self-taught baker...I learnt it all by trial and error. About five years back, there werent many people in Chennai who made French macrons.

They are unique, says shares.Youd think that her inspiration would be an A-list pastry chef. But, Divya says that her inspiration is her mother. She used to make amazing fish pies and I was inspired by that, says Divya, who has followed her mothers footsteps, when it comes making delicious savoury pies. My family prefers my savoury bakes over my sweet ones. Especially the pork and mushroom pie, she says. She grew up in Coonoor, amid tea estates and cottage houses in the Nilgiri hills. She dreams of opening a cottage style caf, outside Chennai, as a reminiscent of her childhood. My childhood was about roaming around in our tea estate, having a beautiful view of the cottages in Coonoor and eating in small time cafes.

He had already spent Rs 50,000 in preparing his two acre field and now it was becoming difficult to recover the input cost.Balchandra Bhagat, a resident of Dobi said every year his family earned from cultivating tomatoes, but this year it had been a total loss.Rakesh said Sehore had made a name for itself in tomato cultivation and its produce was exported up to Delhi in North and down south to Hyderabad and last year the farmers of this area had earned up to Rs 1.25 lakh per acre by selling tomatoes on an average as a result of which a large number of farmers decided to plant it this season too.Commissioner and director horticulture Satyanand said tomatoes were multiple harvest crop and most of the farmers had sold a portion of their produce when prices were high.This is the fag end of the season and there is the final burst of production for which prices must have crashed, the commissioner said saying that he personally had not heard of farmers throwing tomatoes on the road."

(Express photo by Prashant Nadkar/Representational) Exactly a year ago, farmers across the state had gone on a similar strike that had crippled essential supplies. (Express photo by Prashant Nadkar/Representational)Farmers in Maharashtra are gearing up for a fresh round of protests, with a number of groups giving a call for strike in June. Exactly a year ago, farmers across the state had gone on a similar strike that had crippled essential supplies. Vegetables and fruits were stopped from reaching the urban centres while dairies complained of dip in collection as farmers refused to supply milk.After several rounds of discussions with the protesting farmers, the state government had finally agreed to some of their demands, following which the strike was called off. One of the immediate impacts of last years strike was the announcement of Rs 34,000-crore loan waiver in the form of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Samman Yojana. The procurement price of milk was increased to Rs 27 per litre, while, in response to the demand for implementation of the M S Swaminathan Commission report that had recommended that farmers receive at least 1.5 times their production costs, a special commission was announced to ensure that farmers get decent returns for their produce.ALSO READ | Farmer suicides in BJP-ruled states very low, mostly over personal issues: Amit Shah in KarnatakaBut within a year, farmers are ready to start an agitation once again. A group claiming to have the support of more than 30 organisations has called for a farmers strike from June 1. Here are some of the issues that have led to the farmers agitation.Loan waiverThe loan waiver announced by the state government was supposed to wipe off outstanding loans of farmers since 2009. This was the second loan waiver in the state, the previous one having been implemented by the Congress-NCP government in 2007-08. The scheme has been facing teething problems right from the start, mainly on account of over-reliance on technology.To submit their claims for loan waiver, farmers had been asked to fill up online forms, which was to be authenticated by cooperative department using similar data entered by the banks. Technical glitches, and the dependence of many farmers on local officials to fill up these forms, have led to delays in the process. The government had announced that loans worth Rs 23102.19 crore in 46.34 lakh farm loan accounts would be waived. Till March 6 this year, banks have been able to complete this process only for 35.68 lakh accounts, worth a total of Rs 13,782 crore.The delays in completion of loan waiver scheme has impacted disbursement of fresh farm loans for the current season. A number of ineligible farmers had defaulted on their loans, hoping their loans would also be waived off. Because of their defaults, they are finding it difficult to obtain fresh loans.There has been an almost 40 per cent drop in crop loan disbursement for this season, and a 28 per cent rise in lending by money lenders. What is likely to further delay the loan waiver scheme is the state governments acceptance of the demand of tribal farmers who had marched to Mumbai last month to extend the cut-off date of loans to 2001.PricesThe biggest worry of the farmers right now is the low prices their produce is fetching in the market. Barring soyabean, whose season is long over, not a single commodity is trading at government-specified Minimum Support Price (MSP). In the case of perishables like fruits and vegetables, the situation is worse. Rabi tomato, which sells at the rate of Rs 10 a kg, is now trading at Rs 1-2 per kg at the markets of Narayangaon and Junnar. Onions, which till recently were fetching Rs 20 a kg at wholesale markets, are now priced at Rs 6 a kg. Farmer leader and Swabhimani Paksha MP Raju Shetti says the present price slump is the worst he has seen in the last 20 years.ALSO READ | MSP Satyagrah: No mandi where farmers can sell their produce at MSP, says Yogendra YadavThe reasons for low prices are several. In case of important rabi crop like chana, the held over stock of the last two years, and a lack of market confidence, has brought about the slide. A crop like tur, which has reported lower sowing than last year, is also trading over Rs 1,200 per quintal below its MSP as the state tries to deal with the held-over stock. In fact, it is estimated that that farmers in the state have lost over Rs 1,067 crore by selling tur below MSP this season.Government procurement, often the panacea for low prices, has not helped much.Milk and sugarcaneLast year, the government had increased the procurement price of milk from Rs 24 to Rs 27 per litre. Dairies are, however, barely able to pay Rs 20 per litre to farmers owing to a glut of milk powder in the market. Sugar prices are on a steady fall which has made mills default in their payment. There are over Rs 2,200 crore in dues by the mills to cane farmers.The result has been that farmers are staring at another debt trap. With no immediate relief expected from the market, and government interventions inadequate, the farmers find themselves with no option but to start a fresh agitation. Their demands are no different from the last time  assured returns on their produce and a full loan waiver. So close to an election year, they hope to force the government to listen to their demands.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

At the entrance, the modest gallery is filled with hushed gasps. Its a sombre room full of words and photos on the massacre. The lines Its a tragedy of national importance that cannot be allowed to be forgotten jump at you from one wall as a girl asks her mother, How could they shoot without warning?Next-door, Sukumar Mukherjee, bright in a yellow T-shirt, sits under the impassive gaze of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. A neat row of photos, mostly black and white, line the four walls. For Mukherjee, secretary of the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust, this is both home and office  his residence is a short flight upstairs.MAKING OF A MEMORIAL The Jallianwala Bagh was owned by Himmat Singh, a noble in the court of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, who hailed from Jalla village near Fatehgarh Sahib.Area: 6.5 acre (26,000 m2)Resolution for buying the Jallianwala Bagh: 1919Funds collected: Rs 5,60,472Bagh acquired on: 1 August 1920Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust set up: 1 May 1951Flame of liberty cost: Rs 9.25 lakhDesigned by: American Benjamin PolkMemorial inaugurated on: 13 April 1961, by President Dr Rajendra Prasad in the presence of PM Jawaharlal Nehru.Members of the memorial trust: PM is the chairman, and permanent members include the Congress president, Punjab CM, governor, Union culture minister and leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha.Also Read | Part 2: Revisiting Jallianwala 100 years on: The horrible General DyerThe Bangla connectionThe 64-year-old with green eyes was born here, like his father Uttam Charan. The Mukherjees from the Hooghly district of West Bengal have been the caretakers of the Jallianwala memorial from its birth. Sukumars grandfather Sashti Charan Mukherjee, a homeopath practising in Allahabad, was deputed by Congress leader Madan Mohan Malviya to arrange a session in Amritsar in 1910. He never went back. Present at the bagh on the day of the 1919 massacre, Sashti Charan escaped death by hiding under the dais, and later moved a resolution for acquiring the bagh at the Congress session in Amritsar. This was followed by a nationwide appeal for fundraising by Mahatma Gandhi and a trust was set up with Malviya as president and Sashti Charan as secretary. The British, it is said, wanted to obliterate the signs of the massacre by setting up a cloth market here but the Indians managed to acquire the land in 1920. Miffed, the authorities arrested Sashti Charan, who had the land deed, but he remained resolute.IN DISREPAIR The concrete staircase is slowly cracking open. Even the adjacent building, acquired in 2011 as it carried the bullet marks, is beginning to crumble. God forbid there is even minor quake, the entire structure will come crashing down, says a local.A few years ago, an expert committee estimated that the repairs will take around Rs 22 lakh. The sum was sanctioned by former PM Manmohan Singh, but it is yet to reach the trust. Namita Jaspal, a heritage conservator, who has been visiting the bagh frequently, says it needs a lot of work. The buildings are made of Nankshahi bricks, they must be strengthened without disturbing their original character. The gallery too needs an upgrade, its important to showcase original documents and photos in a way that they dont disintegrate.In the past, the trust enjoyed direct access to the Prime Minister, but now all requests are routed through the ministry of culture.The trust is running its salary account on the rent from a Punjab National Bank office, a part of the property, but there are little funds for maintenance, leave alone conservation. The light-and-sound show, for instance, is lying unused for want of repair. Outside the bagh, former Hall Bazaar councillor Sunil Sharma Konti, claims the memorial is facing neglect because of the perception that it is associated with the Congress.Well wishers feel a nominal entry fees of even Rs 1 can make the bagh self-sustainable as it receives around 50,000 visitors a day. This proposal was strongly supported by BJP doyen LK Advani, but nothing came out of it.Ever since, the Mukherjees have been the caretakers of the memorial. Sukumar, the youngest of three brothers, quit his bank job to take up the mantle from his father Upendra Narayan when he died in 1988. I was appointed by then PM Rajiv Gandhi, says Sukumar. The bagh has seen a lot of development, he says, but people no longer accord it the respect it deserves. Most visitors treat it as a picnic spot, sometimes they dont even care to read its history, sighs Sukumar, who has seen a long march of VVIPs at the tall pink obelisk, called the flame of liberty.Also Read | Part 1: Bloodbath on Baisakhi, the massacre that shook the British RajA memorable journeyThough the trust is headed by the prime minister himself, managing the memorial is no cakewalk. In 2011, Sukumar had goons following him when the Punjab and Haryana high court ordered an illegal occupant of a neighbouring building acquired by the trust to vacate it. Sukumar laughs as he recounts how the cops ran away and left him to fend for himself in the middle of the eviction process.A few years ago, when the Indian Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) decided to set up a control room for a light-and-sound show on the massacre, someone spread a rumour that they were planning a mujra. Members of the Bhagat Singh Naujawan Sabha got together and damaged the stage and speakers. It took us one year to get the project back on track. During militancy, a group of youngsters with swords threatened to kill his father, saying they had seen people smoking in the bagh. Papaji was very gutsy, he said, kill me and they left.Former President Dr Rajendra Prasad, ex-PM Jawaharlal Nehru, then CM of Punjab Partap Singh Kairon at the inauguration of the Jallianwala Bagh Memorial Trust on April 13, 1961. (HT photo)Complaints, howsoever frivolous, are commonplace. Last fortnight, the Punjab State Human Rights Commission shot off a notice to the trust, asking it to explain why the Sulabh Shauchalya on the premises was charging Rs 2 from women. Someone must have complained to them; but this is a charge imposed by the company, how do I explain it, Mukherjee wonders.A life less ordinaryLiving with a piece of history has its challenges. Kakali, Sukumars bubbly wife who came here as a young bride in the 1980s when militancy had gripped the state, remembers the siege during Op Bluestar. We couldnt step out for over a week, thankfully papaji (Upendra Narayan) had a habit of storing ration. It was due to the barter of onions and tomatoes that she came close to her neighbours during that period.The galiara project for the beautification of the space around the Golden Temple has compounded the number of visitors to the bagh. We have a free 24-hour light and sound show, says Kakali. With the Golden Temple on one side and a small mosque on the other, they are treated to both gurbani and the call of the muezzin. I enjoy the kirtan, it very soothing, says Kakoli, who has learnt to speak and read Punjabi.Lack of privacy is the first casualty of living here but the couple dont mention it. What Kakali does broach is lack of normal domestic life. Weve never had a weekend, those are reserved for VIP visits, she laughs as Sukumar tells you how hes never celebrated the birthday of his elder daughter Proshita as it coincides with the hanging of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.Sukumars two brothers have moved back to Kolkata, his three sisters too have married and left. After the couples two daughters Proshita, a banker, and Shreya, a designer, moved out due to jobs, Kakali has been dividing her time between Kolkota and Amritsar. Often, Sukumar is left alone with his 90-year-old ailing mother, who introduced Durga Puja to the holy city.My daughters worry about my health and tell me Papa, youve done enough sewa, come stay with us, but I want to see the memorial through its 100th anniversary. Then, I will see, sighs Sukumar.His eyes liquid, Sukumar is clear: I cant turn my back on this place. Its seeped by the blood of so many. I cant let them down.Read Part 4 here"

Year after year, we are struggling against falling market prices, vagaries of climate, an apathetic government and indebtedness. Farming is all that I know but it is no longer viable. I will put up a shop, sell tea or lease out my land, but I wont farm anymore, said Khandbahale, who owns three acres of land.In June last year, Khandbahale was one of the thousands of farmers in Maharashtra who took to the streets to protest against the agrarian crisis the state is battling. One of the central demands of the protesters was a complete loan waiver.As supply of vegetables and milk to the cities stopped, the two-day strike forced chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to announce a farm loan waiver worth Rs 34,000 crore, a demand he had resisted since 2014.Less than a year after the strike and the waiver  up to Rs 1.50 lakh per family  farmers remain unimpressed. In Nasik and Ahmednagar districts, which bore the brunt of the protests, farmers say the waiver hasnt helped ease their struggle.Bowing to pressure The Maharashtra govt announced a loan waiver last June. Farmers say it hasnt helped ease their struggle so far Rs 34,000 cr farm loan waiver was announced by the state government after protests by farmers in June 2017 Rs 1.5 lakh per family cap has been put on the loan waiver. This includes principal and interest amount, crop loans as well as mid-term loans from 2009 to June 2016 The scheme had three components  besides the Rs 1.5 lakh waiver, it offered a one-time settlement option for those whose loans were farm loan waiver was announced by the state government after protests by farmers in June 2017per family cap has been put on the loan waiver.

Out of these, 3.038 million have applied for a full waiver and remaining for the incentive cash amount. Another Rs 10,000 crore has been budgeted for the waiver.Khandbahale owes Rs 8.5 lakh to a bank in Nasik. He can benefit from the Rs 1.5 lakh waiver only after he pays the remaining amount he owes. I dont have Rs 7 lakh in hand, why would I keep incurring more debt if I had the money? I may have to sell off some of my land to make that last payment to the bank. We dont need waivers. We can repay our loans if we get assured prices for our produce, he said.In Putamba village of Ahmednagar district, ground zero of the last years strike, farmers remain disaffected.The loan waiver helps banks more than us. So, the government should stop pretending they have done something big for farmers. If they want to help, then they should increase minimum support prices (MSP), procure the produce from us, said Salim Shaikh, an onion farmer from the village, who may not be able to take advantage of the waiver. This year, his income from soyabean and onion has been minimal. He owes a nationalised bank Rs 3.5 lakh he borrowed as a mid-term loan and Rs 2 lakh as a crop loanThe governments list of beneficiaries shows Maharashtra has 1 million farmers like Khandbahale and Shaikh who owe more than Rs 1.50 lakh to banks. Such farmers have been offered a one-time settlement (OTS)pay off the remaining amount to the bank and get a Rs 1.50 lakh waiver. Not many farmers are in a position to take up this offer.Shaikhs neighbour Rajendra Dhakchaule, a marginal farmer with just two acres of cultivable land, can repay most of his Rs 1.70 lakh debt with the waiver. But his worries dont end with this.I had taken a loan of Rs 3.5 lakh for a tractor and under pressure collected money from a money lender to pay off this loan. I may get some respite due to the loan waiver but thats fleeting help. The ground situation for farmers like me is unsustainable, he says, breaking down.This year, the Dhakchaules spent Rs 56,000 to cultivate onion over an acre of land, but the family of six may not recover even the cultivation costs as onion prices have dropped to Rs 700 per quintal from Rs 3000 per quintal this January. This is an eight-month low for onions.In neighbouring Pimpalgaon village, Vijay Waghchowre, a marginal farmer who owns four acres of land, is still waiting for confirmation of the waiver from his bank.The waiver may help us marginally this year. But I still owe another Rs 2 lakh to a moneylender. If the government wants to help farmers, let it give us subsidies or offer assured prices for our produce.The BJP-led state government is counting on the goodwill of marginal farmers like Dhakchaule to help it tide over the rural discontent.The directives of the chief minister were to ensure a system whereby the loan waiver would be transparent, inclusive and swift. We were careful to learn from the mistakes of the past loan waiver, said Kaustubh Dhavse, officer on special duty at the chief ministers office, who was involved in devising the online system for the loan waiver. There had been connivance at the level of banks, government and farmers earlier to give benefits to ineligible farmers. In our case, there is no room for such connivance because the online system does not allow for it. The waiver has offered benefit to maximum genuine farmers.Goodwill for the government isnt visible on the ground.A section of farmers leaders is continuing protests for a complete loan waiver. This month, as nearly 30,000 largely tribal cultivators marched from Nasik to Mumbai, the leaders put the demand back on their agenda. This was despite a majority of the protestors demanding their rights over forest lands and not a waiver as they have no access to banks.As a temporary relief to farmers to overcome the current distress, a complete loan waiver is essential. Thats why we continue to flag it whenever possible. A hike in MSP is one of our main demands and the state has failed to deliver on that too, said Ajit Navale, general secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha, involved in both the farmers protests.The loan waiver has a limited scope. Consider this, the total crop loan debt on the states farmers is Rs 1.13 lakh crore; the government so far has spent only Rs 13,580 crore on the loan waiver, he said."

Whatever could be salvaged after his emotional outburst, he placed in a heap and put up a sign: Take farm produce for free.That was barely a week after another farmer in Jalna, Premising Chavan, was videographed taking a hoe to a healthy cauliflower field. Days after the video of the apoplectic Chavan destroying his crop was shared widely on WhatsApp, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray met him in Mumbai and handed over aid offered by a private organisation. Cauliflower prices were hovering around Rs 500 a quintal. Its not possible to even cover cost of cultivation and harvest and transport at such prices, Bochate told The Indian Express over the phone. Being able to afford my two boys school fees is increasingly difficult.Instances of farmers dumping their produce on roadsides, witnessed across the country in the aftermath of demonetisation, appear to have returned to Maharashtras countryside as vegetable prices plummet. Days after nearly 40,000 tribals, other farmers and farm labourers marched from Nashik to Mumbai last month, some farmers in northern Nashik dumped tomatoes on the roadside. Prices that week dipped to Rs 200 a quintal in Nashik.Shriram Gadhave, president of the Narayangaon-based Vegetable Growers Association of India, said vegetable prices will remain depressed through the coming summer owing to increased farm area under vegetables. The rains were good, and the water table has improved, so many farmers go in for vegetables expecting good prices in the summer season, he said.Until four or five years back, the pockets around Narayangaon and Nashik used to supply a large percentage of the states tomatoes, he said. But now production is coming in from all corners of the state. Whether its Aurangabad or Beed or elsewhere, local tomatoes are now available in plenty.The promise of better access to processing industries has not borne fruit for vegetable farmers  the capacity of processing industries is barely 2 to 3 per cent of the crop, according to Gadhave. Bochate, who used to drive a Bolero that he purchased with a loan, sold the vehicle two years back to focus on farming.I used to grow soybean before. After I sold the Bolero I repaid the loan and dug a borewell on my land. There was plenty of water, so I was expecting Rs 3 lakh from my tomatoes and brinjal this season, he said. Instead, he was offered Rs 25 per 20-kg crate  that wouldnt cover even the auto ride to the market and the cost of cultivation and harvest.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

I used to bring home different plant cuttings for my garden. She finds it a natural way to relax.Jyoti started working on her present patch of green from 2014. Over these three years, she has developed ground and terrace gardens, in which she has plants that are healthy for consumption. She chooses to do organic gardening.The garden has a variety of fruits such as mulberry, papaya, coconut and mosambi. Vegetables include cauliflower, tomato, cabbage and chilies. She says that the produce is sufficient for her family, and she rarely visits the market.Jyothi also takes a keen interest in exotic plant varieties such as lotus and lilies. She makes her own compost from kitchen waste and, every two months, she gets around eight sacks of compost.She says, Adding chemicals to the soil is harmful to it. Organic gardening begins with attention to the soil. You regularly add organic matter to the soil, using locally available resources wherever possible. And everyone has access to the raw ingredients of organic matter, because your lawn, garden and kitchen produce them every day. Decaying plant wastes, such as grass clippings, fall leaves and vegetable scraps from your kitchen, are the building blocks of compost, the ideal organic matter for your garden soil. If you add compost to your soil, youre already on your way to raising a beautiful, healthy garden.Talking about organic gardening, she says, When you garden organically, you think of your plants as part of a whole system within nature that starts in the soil and includes the water supply, people, wildlife and even insects. An organic gardener strives to work in harmony with natural systems and to minimise and continually replenish any resources the garden consumes. Jyothi, who volunteers at an NGO that works for the betterment of farmers, promotes the practice of organic gardening in her neighbourhood.Jyothi says pest control is necessary. She adds, Removing disease-infected leaves or plants, rotating crops so you are not growing the same type in the same spot year after year, and handpicking insect pests and eggs all help to suppress pest populations. She uses tulsi as a natural way of preventing pests.Jyoti along with her domestic helps invests around two hours in the morning and evening to water the plants and take care of the garden."

We generally do well at home, but our away record hasn't been good. We should try to get teams from 16 to 8 (AFC rankings) ranking. It's difficult to play South Korea and Japan as they don't want to play us. We should get teams who are better than us and play at their home. This is from the organisation side,"" Chhetri told IANS in an interview here.""From the players' side, we need to improve ourselves individually, making sure that the competition for the national team increases and it is a big headache for the coach. It should be tough for him to choose the players and whenever that happens he gets the cream,"" the 33-year-old said.India qualified for the Asian Cup by beating Macau in the qualifiers last year in October.The last time India played in the world's second-oldest continental football championship was in 2011 under British coach Bob Houghton. Chhetri was an integral part of the team, scoring two goals in the group stages in what was only India's third appearance.India did not win a match and bowed out, letting in 13 goals and scoring just three.Chhetri said India should look to play teams like the United Arab Emirates (UAE), who are also hosting the Asian Cup, on the road.Indian football team captain Sunil Chhetri (EPS | Vinod Kumar)""We are at the bottom, man. Whoever we get is going to be better than us,"" Chhetri said when asked to name the teams they should play friendlies with leading up to the tournament, starting in January next year.""In 2011, we got No 1, No 3 and No 5 -- Australia, South Korea, Bahrain (in the main round). It couldn't have been worse than that mathematically. This time we got Kyrgyzstan, Macau and Myanmar (in the qualifiers). With due respect to them it wasn't very difficult.""We should aim to play the UAE, Qatar, Oman, Palestine and Lebanon (in the friendlies),"" Chhetri said.There are talks of a four-nation Champions Cup taking place this year in India. Chhetri said the tourney would have no bearing on India's rankings as it is outside the FIFA dates, but the match practice would do a world of good to India's preparations.""Now it's not about the rankings, because we have qualified. Having said that, the arrangements of the groups matter in terms of ranking but keeping all these things aside, playing at home those three-four nation tournament...I hope we get better teams to play against,"" he said.Chhetri in Bengaluru FC training colours (Twitter/Indian Super League)Coming to his club Bengaluru FC, which is at the top of the ISL standings now, Chhetri said it doesn't have the pressure of expectations and takes one game at a time.""The motto in our club is to think about the next game -- the way we won two Federation Cups and the I-League by taking one game at a time. The motto has not changed,"" he said.Just married to long-time girlfriend Sonam, daughter of former India and Mohun Bagan defender Subrata Bhattacharya, Chhetri signed off tongue-in-cheek, saying he now knows the prices of ""onions and tomatoes"".""The last 10-15 days after marriage... I have enjoyed my time. I think me and Sonam have seen each other for 13 years but we never lived with each other. She was always a tourist wherever I played. Now living together, it's nice, man. More because, apart from the fact that she is my wife and I love her... we are also very good friends,"" he said.""She understands my job. So there was no need of telling her that I have to come back and sleep and take a nap... everything is nice because she understands. Later in the evening we watch Netflix. We go for walks. We went to buy grocery the other day and I realised I haven't taken walks for a long time. I know the rates of onions and tomatoes now (laughs)."""

So far, 20 centres of excellence are functioning in different states under the Indo-Israeli Agriculture Project and five more will be operational by next month. Photo: Israel EmbassyNew Delhi: India and Israel are set to jointly develop new crop varieties and share post harvest technologies following the success of the 10-year-old Indo-Israeli Agriculture Project (IIAP) whose accomplishments include growing cherry tomatoes in Haryana, rejuvenating mango orchards in Maharashtra and demonstrating to Indian farmers the effectiveness of state-of-the-art irrigation technologies.For a country like Israel where 60% of the area is desert, exporting high-value farm produce like mangoes and avocados is a matter of pride, whereas for India, among the largest food producers globally, the challenge is to counter the effects of erratic rainfall, raise productivity and use water efficiently.So, it was with the objective of sharing best practices and technical knowledge from Israel that the agriculture cooperation project was launched in 2008. The implementing partners for the project are the National Horticulture Mission (NHM) under the agriculture ministry, MASHAV, Israels agency for international development cooperation, and Indian state governments which help set up centres of excellence as per their local needs.Our goal is to help the Indian farmer by exposing them to new technologies tailored to their local needs, said Dan Alluf, counsellor of science and agriculture at MASHAV, Delhi.There is a lot of focus on drip irrigation and how to design better farms by using canopy management and use of improved irrigation and fertigation technologies, Alluf said, adding, Each centre showcases a range of greenhouses to farmers depending on their needs and capabilities. A unique focus is to teach farmers the language of irrigation - when to irrigate and by how much - to increase water use efficiency.So far, 20 centres of excellence are functioning in different states and five more will be operational by next month. Notable among these are centres for vegetables in Karnal, Haryana, for mangoes in Dapoli and for citrus fruits in Nagpur, both in Maharashtra, and one for pomegranates in Bassi, Rajasthan.Among the unique projects are a functional centre of excellence for bee-keeping in Haryana and a centre for dairy which is in the pipeline.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit to Israel in July last year, a new action plan for the years 2018-2020 envisages joint development of new crop varieties and sharing of post harvest technologies.Further, the plan is to establish a partnership on water conservation that includes waste-water treatment and its reuse for agriculture, desalination, water utility reforms, and the cleaning of the Ganga and other rivers using advanced water technologies.According to a MASHAV document, vegetable intervention in Haryana showed how crop productivity could be increased 5-10 times under protected cultivation of tomato, capsicum and cucumber, coupled with 65% decrease in water use and substantial reduction in fertiliser and pesticide costs.Similarly, the mango orchard rejuvenation project in Dapoli resulted in a three-fold rise in productivity within three years.Every year, between 10,000 and 20,000 farmers visit each of these centres, and we hope the technologies we are showcasing will echo, carried forward by state governments and the private sector, said Alluf.One of the key ways to boost overall agricultural production is to implement better soil-water management techniques that would provide the arid and semi-arid lands better access to irrigation water, without actually increasing the stress on available water resources, said a NITI Aayog concept paper released in October last year.However, data from the report showed that out of 160 million hectares of cultivable land in India, only about 65 million hectares or 41% is covered under irrigation. Also, just 8.6 million hectares are currently covered under micro-irrigation compared to a potential 69.5 million hectares.In states which are water-stressed such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Gujarat, adoption of drip irrigation has been faster but so far, adoption of these technologies among north Indian farmers has been lower due to easy water availability, said Siraj Hussain, former agriculture secretary and currently a fellow at the Delhi-based Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.The centre and state governments also need to push these technologies with more funding. Last years budget announced a Rs5,000 crore micro-irrigation fund, but it took almost a year to operationalise it, Hussain added."

Onion prices have recorded a correction at a time when the central government has announced a special initiative for the crop along with tomato and potato.Onion prices have dipped again in the wholesale markets with the bulb trading below Rs 1,000 per quintal. A bumper crop in Maharashtra as well as early arrival of rabi onions in the wholesale markets of states like Gujarat and Rajasthan led to a steep price correction which traders say is likely to remain for the rest of the season. On Wednesday, the average price of onions at Lasalagon wholesale market in Nashik was Rs 788 per quintal  one third of the price it fetched in January. Onion prices have been showing a downward trend since the beginning of March. In most wholesale markets, average traded price was below Rs 1,000 per quintal.This is in sharp contrast to the price trend a few weeks back when prices were hovering between Rs 1,500-2,000 per quintal. Prices had crossed the Rs 3,000 mark in November, December and January which spiked the prices in the retail markets as well. The eight-month bull run, farmers had said, had come after almost a 15 month slump which saw farmers selling onions at throw away prices of Rs 300-5,00 quintals. The price slump is due a bumper summer or rabi crop which has started arriving in the markets. Maharashtra has reported around 3.5 lakh hectares under summer onion this year as against the 3 lakh hectares last year. Also onion crop area has increased in neighbouring states of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. Maharashtra accounts for almost 60 per cent of the summer crop.Farmers normally store their produce in moisture and heat proof structures called Kanda chawl to dispose them of later in the season. Rabi onions normally feed the market from March till the arrival of the new kharif crop later in September.Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of Lasalgaons wholesale market, said that the bumper arrivals have brought down prices. Arrival is huge and thus prices have come down. We fear prices might go down further in view of the good crop expected, he said.Onion prices have recorded a correction at a time when the central government has announced a special initiative for the crop along with tomato and potato. Under Operation Green, the government wishes to re-construct the success in the dairy sector under Operation Flood. However, as prices come down, traders say exports have also taken a hit despite nil minimum export price (MEP). There is no demand from the outside markets, said Jagdish Apshunde, an exporter at Nashiks wholesale market. Till November last year, the country had recorded 17,72, 254.31 quintals of onion export.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

He believes that the taste of North East is still not widely known. Das says The cuisine from north eastern states are surprisingly different from one another. While Sikkim and Arunachal have Tibetan and Nepalese influence; Meghalay, Tripura and Assam have some characteristics of food from East Bengal. Manipuri food has good vegetarian options, he says.Mediterranean food is hot now, believes Vinesh Gupta, general manager, The Den Bengaluru. He says, The Mediterranean-inspired dishes are packed with flavour  especially smoky, spicy notes made with fresh, clean, better-for-your ingredients. They dont require meat to take a starring role, which is perfect for the growing number of consumers opting for vegetarian meals.Interaction between the chef and customer is also a trend that is fast catching up. Chef Vikas Seth, Culinary Director at Embassy Leisure, Sanchez & Sriracha says, Several dishes are now made live at tables and the concept of chefs table is also becoming very popular.He also points to the proliferation of new cuisines from across the world due to interest of well-travelled customers.Technology is prerequisite, even in food industry. Chef Sanjeev Kapoor predicts, We will see several new food ventures in the digital space in terms of social media, gadgets, apps and more.Beer and CocktailsLets get old-fashionedCocktails with fancy names at a bar will take a back seat this year. Hemant Mundkur, brand ambassador of Diageo India, believes that there is going to be a rise in cocktails preparations at home, hosting friends the old fashioned way. He also predicts that Scotch whisky will find its way into cocktails this year.Abhishek Bindal, AVP, operations, KA Hospitality, talks about a very interesting liquid trend  Barrel aged cocktails. He explains This trend involves putting pre-mixed drinks into barrels for a few weeks in order to enhance the flavour, texture and complexity of the cocktail following the same ideology behind whiskey, wine and other traditional spirits.He adds that most people in Bengaluru prefer their Gin & Tonic. This pattern will continue but people will look at more evolved G&T cocktails and will be open to experimenting more with the flavours and types of gin.Sour beer in your mugChef Yogen DattaJohn Eapen, a city-based brewery consultant talks about the big beer trends that will rule the roost in the city this year. He says, Bengaluru has a mature craft beer audience. People travelling abroad are trying a broad spectrum of craft beer styles. Bitter styles such as Pale Ales and IPAs (India Pale Ales) are slowly gaining momentum and catching up with Wheat Beers. Expect more Sour Beers in 2018.He adds consumers have started appreciating craft beer helping drive consumption. Outlets in city do anywhere from 10,000-20,000 liters every month. Bengalurus craft beer standards (batch quality/consistency) are also some of the highest in the country, he says.Matcha Fever to continueA meal is never complete without a dessert. Chef Yogen bats for pairing of unusual flavours in desserts. He says Green apple and cucumber with single origin chocolate to create a light chocolate dessert is a fine example of the food pairing in desserts. Juxtaposing ingredients which are seemingly not alike, is helping chefs create new sensations.The Matcha fever took over India last year and many restaurants have now come up with their own versions. Talking about this popular trend, Chef Yogen says This flavour is unique and is a departure from the sweet, floral and fruity flavours, desserts are usually associated with. However, Abhishek credits the health benefits of Matcha for its rising popularity. He says, With 10 times the antioxidants of regular green tea, Matcha graduated from simply being used as just a tea to being sold in health-food stores as a superfood ingredient for use in baking and desserts.Chef Abhijit Saha, Founder, Director and Chef  Avant Garde Hospitality concludes with a very unusual dessert trend for 2018. He predicts This year will see a surge in introduction of salts in desserts. A lot of usage of spices and herbs in desserts will be seen, along with unusual items such as tomatoes, olives and olive oil."

The years are breathing down the neck of Kidambi Srikanth. Saina Nehwal voiced her intent to try becoming the first Indian woman to win the prestigious crown while PV Sindhu has looked the likeliest to win it for some time. The years are breathing down the neck of Kidambi Srikanth.Indian badminton has been a scroll of happy headlines for the last 10 years since Saina Nehwal scored her first upset win at the Beijing Olympics. Success at the Super Series, the World Championships and the Olympics has added layers to its history, as a flurry of names have cornered fame and remain in fine fettle to stake claim on any title. Yet, the best of the countrys shuttlers keep returning to the All England to reconnect with badmintons original moment of glory: the All England. In the coming week  and in years to come, indeed  Indias global stars are bound to race each other to the one title their coach Pullela Gopichand has, and they dont: the All England.Saina Nehwal began 2018 voicing her intent to try becoming the first Indian woman to win the prestigious crown. For some time now, PV Sindhu has looked the most likeliest to get herself into contention. The years are breathing down the neck of Indias biggest hope K Srikanth  its been 17 Marches now, since Gopichand last won. That had taken 20 years of waiting after Prakash Padukones big moment for Indian mens singles which turns 38 this spring. Both HS Prannoy and B Sai Praneeth will be acutely aware that this Super 1000 event  a $10,00,000 event  can catapult them ahead of every other shuttler in the countrys imagination. China and Indonesia Super 1000s  second tier after World Championship  bring in the same money, but All England is what sets hearts aflutter.Gopichand would be the first to know the enormity of the event. And hence, he will be the last person to remind his charges of the larger significance  and in turn pile on the pressure. Indians will head into Birmingham on Wednesday the same way they do at any other meet  looking at mid-week as the first of a hopeful five matches to come. The toughest throw of the dice has gone Saina Nehwals way. Yet, who else but the trailblazer, to embrace that stiff challenge.The rivalryNehwal starts against Chinese Taipeis Tai Tzu Ying. This is a saga worthy of a chapter of its own. The World No 1 vs Indias original superstar. The numbers have insidiously turned against Nehwal in the last 8 years  the Indian won the first 4 of their faceoffs, lost the next two before stamping down the talented opponent for a title at the Swiss Open in 2013, and then lost 7 in a row. Its not this notoreity of piled up losses though that makes this contest interesting. Saina (world No 11) vs Tai Tzu (world No 1) is anything but run-of-the-mill: it is in fact an opportunity for the Indian to hog headlines on Day 1. The surface of the courts at the Birmingham Arena is said to be harder than usual, and decisive footwork on this carpet that draws added effort out of the legs, remains key to beating Tai Tzu.Nehwal has worked specifically with coach Gopichand on quickening her movements against an opponent who is toughest to pre-empt with her variety in strokes. Just about the only solution is to be quick on the feet and hope that her anticipation antennae are specially alert if she wants to start chipping at the 5-9 head to head. Picking the Taiwanese girls strokes is half the job done, and Nehwal will have to back herself to not get blitzed away like happened at Indonesia two months ago. Nehwal would want to bring in her typical confidence that gets reinforced when her fitness is high and her movements precise.PV Sindhu can afford to look beyond the first round where she meets Chochuwong Pornpawee of Thailand. American Beiwen Zhang  the last woman to beat Sindhu a month ago, could be next, though she could find herself in a slugfest as early as quarters against Nozomi Okuhara. Sindhu too brought the All England in her radar vocalising her wish to win it in the run-up, and this will be the first of 2018s big events, where she would want to assert her ability to go for the titles, though Marin and Akane Yamaguchi are in the fourth seeds half of the draw to make life difficult.The draw has been wicked to the Chinese, with three clubbed into one quarter.Shuttle speeds permitting, Kidambi Srikanth ought to back himself to go deep into the tournament. He starts against Worlds giant killer Frenchman Brice Leverdez, and could be in a tricky quarter with HS Prannoy  who will need to beat higher ranked Chou Tien Chen and the plucky Indonesians. Chong Wei and Lin Dan will play out their skirmish of the ageing titans, before Srikanth gets a crack at them, but the country isnt one of the Indians happiest haunts.Three first round exits in 4 years mean Srikanth, aged 25, ranked 3, whos best performance was clearing the first round here, hasnt had the best of All Englands. But 2017 was a sensational year for Indias best mens singles player, and he cabn fancy his chances in a field that is depleted just a tad by the withdrawal of World No 1 Viktor Axelsen. Theres a slippery second round against Chinese Huang Yuxian (Srikanth lost to a first-time Chinese last year) or local hero Rajeev Ouseph. But should the stars align on five days, this could be Srikanths All England.Prannoy and Sai Praneeth are there to upset equations and trigger a ruckus in the draw  though Praneeth starts out against automaton  the defensive Son Wan Ho. The Indian is known for his impatience when botching matches, and itll be a mini-victory of sorts if he can clear the first hurdle against the Korean whose second nature is to induce ennui.Indias doubles pairings await a break-out performance, and will need to stay in contention till Friday, to corner attention amidst Indias strongest singles contingent. The doubles pairings are also battling the distraction of the new service rule that is being put into trial at All England.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

The model contract law, a copy of which has been reviewed by Hindustan Times, follows the Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2018.Conceived in the 1960s, APMC regulations require farmers to sell to licenced middlemen only in notified markets, usually in the same area as the farmer, rather than directly to buyers elsewhere.These rules were meant to protect farmers from being forced into distress selling. Over time, they have spawned layers of intermediaries, stretching the farm-to-fork supply chain. This results in a large price spread, meaning fragmentation of profit share because of the presence of too many middlemen.Usually, farmers get the lowest share of profit. APMCs have also become hubs for cartels that rig the system to offer lower prices to farmers while driving up prices for consumers. India has about 6,800 such public-sector markets.The revised Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2018, now set to be released to states, allows firms to sign advance contracts with farmers to grow a chosen crop or its specific variety with a buy-back assurance at an agreed price, giving cultivators a ready market without the oversight of the APMC system.A model law isnt presented in Parliament, but is instead sent to states for passage since the Centre cannot bring laws to regulate agriculture marketing, which falls in the states domain.To work around APMC markets, the budget for fiscal 2019 has also proposed to develop 22,000 new or existing private rural markets.The revised provisions of the model contract law state that businesses and farmers can enter into contracts for any crop, livestock breed or poultry of their choice. The earlier version, released for public scrutiny on January 23, restricted contract farming to only those crops that are allowed by states.The model law provides for dispute settlement at the level of the tehsil, or local administrative unit. It does away with an earlier provision that disputes could be taken for appeal to a decree court. Instead, the parties can escalate it to a three-member local authority, comprising an independent farmer, a corporate representative and a domain expert, all unrelated to the contracting parties. The law seeks to protect the farmers lands and their title. No business can build permanent structures on a farmers land or seize land. Registrations of contracts will be completely online, the model law says. The earlier version provided for physical contracts.Technological advancement with better agricultural practices makes contract farmers more technically and economically efficient, according to a 2016 post-doctoral study on contract farming in Punjab by Nivedita Sharma of the New Delhi-based Jawaharlal Nehru University.In most cases of contract farming, the sponsor, or the contracting firm, also directly provides most inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, as well as credit and technical skills to the farmers with whom it enters into a deal. This lowers the market risk for farmers.Several states did reform markets and gave direct marketing licences to various kinds of corporate buyers like Tata, Mahindra and Godrej, said R Ravikanth, an analyst with commodity trading firm Comtrade.We dont support contract farming because it is another form of exploitation. Why isnt there a provision that all produce will be contracted above minimum support prices? said Pema Ram, a leader of the All India Kisan Sabha.Most of these licences are not in use, Ravikanth added, because it is difficult to coordinate with a large number of small farmers. Current examples of contract farming include PepsiCo Inc. for tomato in Punjab, SABMiller Plc. for barley and McCain Foods Ltd for potato in Gujarat."

With the aim of alleviating farmer distress, the Centre included in the Union Budget an increase in the minimum support price for monsoon crops and pledged Rs 500 crore to Operation Greens, a programme to help farmers growing tomatoes, onions, and potatoes. Such measures will benefit farmers who own land, not those who dont.Data shows that 71% of Scheduled Caste farmers are what the census refers to as agricultural labourers  they work for wages on land they do not own. That figure is much lower among other groups: 47% for Scheduled Tribe farmers and 41% for non-SC/ST farmers. Data from the 70th round of Land and Livestock Holdings Survey of the NSSO indicates that 58.4% of rural Dalit households are landless -- a much higher proportion than households in any other social group. Landlessness is particularly severe among Dalits in states with a history of feudalism such as Haryana, Punjab and Bihar, where more than 85% of Dalit households do not own any land other than the plot they live on. More than 60% of Dalit households are landless in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Kerala, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and Odisha. The Socio Economic and Caste Census points out that landlessness and dependence on manual casual labour for a livelihood are key deprivations facing rural families, making them far more vulnerable to impoverishment.Apart from sporadic efforts, most notably in the Gandhian Bhoodan movement pioneered by Vinoba Bhave in Telangana in the 1950s and by Left governments in West Bengal and Kerala, and to some extent the National Conference government in Jammu and Kashmir, radical measures such as land distribution have not been taken.Of late, a newer generation of politicians has again voiced the demand for giving five acres of land to landless Dalit households as a means to resolve the crisis of rural livelihoods. It is not in agricultural alone that the Dalits have been short-changed. They are under-represented when it comes to jobs in the private sector and education. The States role in fighting this inequality is crucial. But with land holdings becoming even more fragmented  86% of the holdings in India are small and marginal, less than two hectares  it remains to be seen whether populist sops such as loan waivers, employment guarantee schemes and food security initiatives bring relief to small, marginalised farmers fighting landlessness, discrimination and poverty."

An Australian delegation visited the governments centre of excellence at Bassi in Jaipur district recently to study the prospects of introducing the technique in the state.Soon, the Australian government will send a formal proposal for sharing this technique with Rajasthan, after which the work will start, said Prabu Lal Saini, the state agriculture minister.Hydroponics is a method to grow plants without soil, using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent.The three-member delegation, including South Australian governments investment manager (Indian trade) Rahul Ranjan and Australian firm Ironwoods chief consultant Mark Cody, studied the site and infrastructure at the centre for two days beginning January 11.Saini said that hydroponics technique would be used in the farming of tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, cucumber (kheera) and coloured capsicum. The farming of these vegetables will be done in 4,000 square metre area in Bassi. Use of the technique would increase the yields manyfolds, he said.Generally, yield per plant of tomato in three months is around half a kg and when grown in poly house the yield increases to 5-6kg per plant in six months, but through the hydroponics technique, the yield per plant will increase to around 65-70kg per plant in 10 months. Similarly, yield of coloured capsicum and cucumber is around 4kg per plant, which will increase by six times to 24kg per plant, he informed. Such innovations will help in doubling the income of farmers, he added.The crop will be grown vertically to accommodate more plants in the same area, thus increasing the yield. More production of vegetables will help in curbing hike in prices and common man can get quality vegetables at affordable prices, he said.Once it is started at Bassi, hydroponics will be propagated to farmers in the state, he said. Even during these two years of pilot move, an Indian version of hydroponics technique will be developed so that farmers can afford it, he added.The agriculture department has sanctioned 13 crore for the two-year project starting from June this year. Saini said the department has constituted a committee to speed up the project. The project will be supervised by Rajasthan Olive Cultivation Limited (ROCL)."

By March 15, the botanists aim to scan more than 25,000 specimens and will send the digital images to the BSI.The BSI mooted the proposal in 2013 and it took them more than five years to ink the deal. The pioneer flora institute has plans to send 12 more botanists to London so that the scanning can be completed within a year to streamline the database, Singh said.The Portuguese introduced potato and tomato to India, he said.Being a staple food item in India, there is a need to identify the species that belong to the family, he said.We know of kand-mool, which has reference in historical transcripts but it was replaced by potato and tomato.The specimens at the London museum will help us to identify alternates of the two crops so that we can harvest the plants as well.Botanists are also scanning plant species from neighbouring countries, including Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar and this will help in understanding the genesis of different plant species."

In Rajasthan, modernisation faces a typical structural hurdle. The share of marginal and small land-holdings in total land ownership in the state is 40.12% and 21.90% respectively, according to the states Economic Survey 2017-18. Such highly skewed land distribution itself makes the use of even simpler tools, such as a tractor, uneconomical.A document on Rajasthans agriculture challenges by the Niti Aayog in 2016 cites this as a major barrier in effective intervention in the advancement of agriculture.Yet, Indias largest state with 61% arid or semi-arid climate and 35 million in poverty (those with less than Rs 1 lakh in annual income) wants to do an Israel in agriculture: make the desert bloom.It has, over the last couple of years, set up six hi-tech centres, such as the one outside Jaipur, to disseminate cutting-edge Israeli horticulture technologies. Three more are in the works. No state has so many Centres of Excellence.The six are in Kota (citrus fruits), Bassi (pomegranates), Jaiselmers Sagra Bhojhka (date palm), Devravas in Tonk district (guavas), Jhalawar (mandarins), and Khemri Dholpur ( mangoes). Three more are coming: Chittor (pumpkin), Boondi district (vegetables) and Sawai Madhopur (flowers). There is an olive programme as well.We have got the best technologies from countries such as Israel and Netherlands for these centres of excellence, says agriculture minister Prabhulal Saini.Why would a state with diverse farm produce want to go big on fruits and vegetables more suited for the overseas palate? Rajasthan is after all Indias largest producer of mustard, with a 48% share in national output. Despite being mostly arid, it is also the countrys largest producer of bajra (pearl millet), guar (cluster beans) and coarse cereals, apart from spices.Where state stands Agriculture comprises 27% ofRajasthans gross domestic productOn all-India basis, the state ranks second in total pulses and oilseeds as well as milk output. The main justification is that Rajasthans topography and agro-climatic conditions are similar to Israels. The Jewish state has been known for its agricultural success using innovation. Rajasthan too, the logic goes, can go from being David to Goliath in agriculture.There are both supporters and critics of this new strategy that aims to shift a sizeable section of middle farmers away from traditional water-guzzling crops, such as wheat.The idea is to make them grow citrus fruits and vegetables with water-economising technologies. In these crops, the state could do better, just like Israel. So, its looking at a mixed cropping patterns. A little maths and youll understand, says director horticulture VP Singh. Input costs in traditional crops are rising. Agree? And farmers returns are falling, he says.Greenhouse cucumber production gives an average 50 tonne of average production. The average cost of cucumber is about Rs 20 per kg. So thats Rs 10 lakh in total revenue. If total costs are Rs 3-4 lakh, that means saving of around Rs 6 lakh.On paper, this makes sense. On the ground, the task is neither easy nor cheap. One hurdle is funds. The number of applications from farmers aspiring to go high-tech is low but still far higher than earmarked subsidies can support.Moreover, farmers cant be dictated on what to grow and how much water to use. Israel overcame its water crisis by imposing huge tariffs on excessive water consumption. At the peak of a drought in 2010, citizens were asked to cut their shower time. Israelis couldnt wash cars with hoses.We cant do all that here. Rajasthan should not be growing much wheat. Where is the water? But you cant ban it. All we can do is give them alternatives, says Neelkamal Darbari, the states principal secretary.Agriculture  which contributes 27% to states GDP  has seen volatile returns mainly because of rainfall swings. For instance, in 2013-14, farm GDP grew an impressive 6.8%. That slowed to 2.6 in 2014-15. The next year (2015-16), farm growth almost flattened at 0.78%. It rebounded in 2016-17 at 6.3%.To popularise high value horticulture, the Vasundhara Raje-led state government launched a series of events to showcase technological demonstrations and attract investments.Three chapters of the Global Rajasthan Agritech Meet have been held so far  at Jaipur in November 2016, Kota in May 2017 and Udaipur in November, 2017. Approximately 1.23 lakh farmers participated in these events. They saw technology with their own eyes, Saini says. These events also led to 40 agreements worth Rs 1,555.83 crore for investments in agriculture and allied sectors, according to a government document.Until these investments come through, state subsidies are the only way. Protected cultivation is expensive. Since there is great demand, we will need substantially more funds, says Singh.Protected cultivation refers to a package of practices requiring capital investments in equipment such as greenhouses, shade-nets and micro-irrigation.The mission faces a classic budget constraint. The first limitation is that the National Horticulture Missions spending limit for protected cultivation is 25% of the total budget (of about Rs 150 crore annually). Farmers need to submit plans for a minimum of 2000 square meters (half an acre) to avail a subsidy of Rs 10 lakh (or 50% of the costs, whichever is lower). A protected-cultivation farm on one acre (4000 sq m) costs about Rs 35 lakh.Currently, the government has received about 1,500 applications from farmers for 5000 acres. For protected cultivation, the subsidy allotted is Rs 32 crore. Given that each farmer is entitled to Rs 10 lakh, only 320  or just 21%  can be covered in the short-term.If in a district, there are 100 applicants, then the waiting time can stretch up to 5 years, Singh adds. One of those in the queue is 50-year-old Bishen Paroda outside Sikar town, who says he wants to grow cucumber.To reduce the waiting time, Rajasthan has increased the subsidy limit to 70% from 50% for smaller farmers and sought to link them with bank loans. The Niti Aayog review says the subsidy for all types of farmers should be raised to 70%, otherwise the scheme could be adversely affected.Critics of the programme say Rajasthan cant take its eyes off traditional crops because thats what the majority grows. From an experiment point of view, hi-tech horticulture is fine. But there must be an income boost from traditional crops which employs the most people, says Bhagirath Choudhary, the director of the New Delhi-based South Asia Biotechnology Centre, who hails from the state."

I have not been able to recover the cost of cultivation due to the low prices of tomatoes, said Saini.Wholesalers at the wholesale fruit and vegetable mandi in Kota Prakash Batwani said that last year tomato prices were around Rs 25 per kg till December and around Rs 80 in July last year. However, at present, the prices are Rs 4 to Rs 8 per kg.The retail prices of tomato are around Rs 8 to Rs 10 per kg, he said.Giving reasons for the low prices, he said that tomato production increases in Kota and nearby areas in winter due to which prices come down around this time every year.Production of tomatoes in Bundi, Deoli region of Tonk, Kota, Sawai Madhopur and other nearby areas goes up in January-February every year. Due to this, tomato prices drop. But the prices go up during the monsoon season when there is no production of tomatoes locally and it is brought from other states such as Maharashtra and Karnataka, said Girish Dalwani , a tomato wholesaler.According to the horticulture department, tomato is cultivated on approximately 3,500 hectares of land in Kota division."

(Express photo by Kevin DSouza) A foodie, Ankita Raina has shed her calorific intemperance to improve her fitness. (Express photo by Kevin DSouza)The delicately delicious onion-tomato orgy on mutton for the Rogan Josh, was the biggest sacrifice Ankita Raina remembers making at the altar of tennis success. Olive oil drizzled salads and the bland pasta staple replaced the waft of a wonder memory of that Kashmiri kernel.Ankitas journey will continue from a strong showing at the Fed Cup in Delhi to the next port of call as she tries to better her ranking beyond 222the highest she reached around the time the last Fed Cup was played in India at Hyderabad in 2015. Indias No 1 takes flights mostly now, but recalled the train journey she undertook alone in 2012 as a 19-year-old finding her perfect Rogan Josh. I was playing a tournament in Delhi and realised itd been long since I visited my grandparents in Kashmir. First, all the cousins had planned to go, but then everyone else chickened out. There is a lot of strife there, but Kashmir is really heaven on earth, I found a lot of sukoon (peace) there at that time, she had said, speaking in the summer of 2015. Also, I really like mutton cooked in our Kashmiri stylewith lots of onion and tomatoes. That impulsive train journey was memorable, shed added with a sigh.Ankita is accustomed to long, meandering journeys in tennisand not just matches that last 2 hours-24 minutes, and 2 hours-53 the next day to beat Chieh-Yu Hsu incidentally Indias longest Fed Cup tie over the last weekend in Delhi. I always loved travelling by train as a child, and hated returning home. Tennis took me to places like Kavali in Andhra, Gulbarga and Mandya and I started travelling alone at 14. It used to be scary sometimes  new places, new culture, but I realised I dont panic immediately. Also you cant stop trains by pulling chains in Morocco! she laughs retelling her pet tale.Ankita Rainas oft-told Casablanca story involves a miss and a sigh. Followed by some shrill, hysterical cries of Pull it again, man! as she tried to stop a train she was travelling in, by cranking repeatedly at the first thing resembling a chain, with a friend screaming nearby.The pair of them, teenaged tennis players from India, had landed at Casablanca and were to take a connecting train from the basement of the airport to Rabat in Morocco for a junior tournament. The two misheard announcements alternating in Arabic and French and would miss their station just as Ankita  an accomplished train traveller back home owing to her India-wide criss-crossing for ITF juniors meets, immediately scanned around for a chain to pull and bring the train to a halt. Its when she rushed to the door pressing frantically at the buttons  that the chaos reached a crescendo. The pair were slapped a fine of 6000 dirhams. This opened the floodgates of the bawling friend. When the TC came, I told him how we were headed for a tennis tournament, and were traveling alone. We were very little and howling, and they finally understood and put us on the train back, she recalled.Indias top singles player at World No 253 has had a different graph than the countrys high-achieving predecessor in singlesSania Mirza. At 25, the results havent come in a bunch and she continues to battle to climb every step of the rankings ladder. The turbulence on the flight up hasnt quite stopped. My first flight alone was to Hyderabad and I told people I was 15. I was actually carrying a note from parents that said I was 12 and needed supervision, she recalled. Other adventures include winning a meet in Muzaffarnagar, watched by a ring of phlegmatic policemen guarding the tournament in the crime-infested area.When you dont hit the double digits of rankings early in tennis, theres a lot of unglamorous detours and wrong trains where life inadvertently takes you. Remaining undefeated in singles through a zonal Fed Cup week in your national capital has taken time to happen, with the double-fisted backhand and the serve variations for speed and placement, still being work in progress.Though her father accompanied her to meets in her pre-teens, it was her mum who nudged her into tennis. I started at 4. My mother was a sports enthusiast who did athletics and TT. Travelling with a parent though means double the cost so I had to learn to fend for myself very early, she added. The family had first watched Tim Henman play a Satellite Challenger at Ahmedabad where young Ankita chased the Brit for autographs, and it was from watching Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi that the girl started falling for the game.After some male players from Ahmedabad started training at Hemant Bendres academy in Pune, Ankita would shift too. Though her favourite surface for her aggressive game remains grass, shed do well on hard courts even while practicing on clay taking her time to learn the proper clay game of slices and slugging. Ankita favoured the chip and charge and took a liking for the drop shotsomething she used when downing Yulia Putintseva, the 81-ranked combustible Kazakh. As a kid, Ankita started loving smacking the ball and didnt hold back even if they kept landing long and thumping against fences at Ahmedabad.The forehand was developing into a weapon, but in 2012 shed run into a Chinese at a meet to secure a wildcard for the Australian Open who kept banging the ball with such menace that rallying at that speed got impossible. She would double her gym work to gain that kind of power, and though she detested running rounds, weight training soon became the favourite part of her workout. I have puked during running sessions though to try and get to that level of stamina, she recalled. 2013 would see her change her diet after extensive travel and oily food gave her acidity and sore throats during matches. I was a foodie. Then suddenly my dietician was telling me about olive oil and eating right, she said.All the time she would be wracked by the perennial dilemmawhether to chase titles at smaller events that fetched her headlines to woo the sponsors, or whether to play the higher graded meets of WTA and push for ranking points. All my time was spent making decisionstaking gambles on meets and balancing risks, one eye at the entry date, the other at withdrawals. Retreating from Japan, going to Marrakesh. After the last Fed Cup, Sania advised me on which tournaments to pick. When she was coming up, she was an inspiration and it was a dream to try play like her. Everyone used to say, Indians are not that strong, and we dont have the genes for tennis. Its difficult but Sania proved its possible, she added.On rough days, the family including brother Ankur, would be rushing from embassy to airportwith Ankita taking in her stride different cities and time zonesjust trying to get to the venue, tired and spent and losing in the first round as a result. There are times when Id feel low and not confident. But Id think that when I succeed all the praise will be for me, while my family is doing it all selflessly, she said.Her transition from juniors to seniors was typically protracted, and shed seek help of a psychologist. Ankita frequently started using the drop shot in stiff tie breakers. After a point, finishing the crunch matches is all mental, she had said, after a few close matches at the Fed Cup went the other way.From 2015 to now, Raina seems to have sorted out her end-game and won all her singles matches this time. Her parents whod watched Sharapova win the Wimbledon in 2004, would chip in with advice: how Cibulkova was always on her toes and jumping on court, how Ivanovic picked everything on the rise, how Federer stayed calm and Nadal covered the court. I went through a phase where I used to be confused  I wanted to be calm and aggressive also at the same time, she chuckled, adding that though she used to be shy off-court, she could pull out the fangs when playing.Ankita, meanwhile faced problems that tennis divinity rarely does. First it was tough to travel much, then I started feeling the need for a physio. The shoulder would get tight when I pushed too hard in training, she said. Shed stack up some good results in doubles in makeshift partnerships, but it needed solid singles results for Raina to grab eyeballs.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

A misal-pav stall run by the Tellis family has been dishing out the street favourite between 4 am and 7 am for long enough to do without advertising. From selling tea, driving an autorickshaw and now selling misal, the Tellis family has always preferred the night to make a living. Elar Tellis, popularly known as Michael, came to Mumbai from his native Mangalore 45 years ago. Starting off with a tea stall, the story of his misal-pav joint at Sarvodaya Nagar in Mulund West unfolds at night. The joint mainly attracts corporate employees who work until the early hours, along with a younger crowd on their way home from late night parties.I had a tea stall in Mangalore, but as I didnt earn enough for my family, I came to Mumbai when I was 14 years old on my friends suggestion. I initially started working at stalls at the Andheri railway station and later, worked at Bandra. But I always wanted to have my own business, Michael said. He then started selling tea in Mulund along with his two younger brothers.After working with others for five years, I learnt how to run a business in Mumbai, so I started my own and got my two brothers Marshal and Xavier on board, said Michael, adding that he had been witness to the transformation of the eastern suburb of Mulund from a forest area to a residential one.I would start selling tea at 4 am as I was told that in Mumbai, I would end up earning more money as people usually step out at night and look for tea stalls. However, I didnt earn much by selling tea. We then took a loan and bought a rickshaw which my brother would drive. He drove during night hours and I would drive during the day after selling tea in the early hours, he said.With a loan to repay, Michael then decided to make good on his idea to start an eatery. In the initial days of his tea stall, a family ran an eatery next to it, recalled Michael. However, suddenly one day, the family closed the stall and disappeared.Michaels son Santosh Tellis said: My father saw that the eatery had been closed for many days, following which he got the idea of starting his own. Then, we set up the stall and started selling misal from 3 am to 7 am. During the initial days, we were incurring heavy losses as we didnt attract too many customers. But, after Ganesh Chaturthi, we started getting business and we started recovering the losses. People would come to our stall aftervisarjan and eat misal, and that is how word spread across Mulund. Since then, the Tellis family has been running a misal joint at night, following which they return to their day jobs  the father runs a tea stall and the son is employed with an online shopping portal.Michael and Santosh wake up at 2 am, and after preparing a hearty dish of misal, the duo start selling it at around 4 am. I have to sleep early at night so that I can wake up early, following which I have to report to my job at 10 am. As my father is ageing, we have also hired two person to take care of our tea stall while my father supervises the business during the day, said Santosh.The midnight misal is served at Rs 40 per plate with two pavs. The stall also sells taripav at Rs 10 per piece. They attract customers from Ghatkopar, Powai, Thane, Bhandup and Airoli. In taripav, we basically mix ingredients of misal, like sprouts, moth beans, farsan, tomatoes, onions, boiled potatoes, lemon and coriander and then hand it over to the customer, said Santosh. Between 4 am and 6 am, the joint is crowded with customers, and many of them end up asking for takeaways.A resident of Mulund, Varun Ghatani, said: My personal favourite is taripav, and whenever I go out with my friends for night-outs, I see to it that I visit Michael and eat taripav.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

And while a majority of Indian farmers cultivate their own land, Dalit farmers in much of the country continue to work for wages, data released last week by the Census of India confirms.The data shows that 71% of Scheduled Caste farmers are what the census refers to as agricultural labourers  that is, they work for wages on others land. That figure is much lower among other groups: 47% for Scheduled Tribe farmers and 41% for non-SC/ST farmers.We are thinking of the agricultural community as one group, and providing it with a number of sops, said Nilanjan Ghosh, a senior fellow and head of economics at the non-partisan Observer Research Foundation in Kolkata. But the benefit is essentially being obtained by landowners, and it hardly goes to the labourers. We dont have anything for them. Other economists agreed. Any gains from these policies are unlikely to be passed down in terms of higher wages, Ashwini Deshpande, a professor at the University of Delhis School of Economics, said in an email. On the whole it would be safe to say that, by and large, these policies do not touch agricultural labour.Wages for agricultural labourers have not increased in the last four years, according to Himanshu, a professor at the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi. This, even as the Centre and states have introduced policies meant to alleviate farmer distress  loan waivers, crop insurance, and increased MSP, which ensure that farmers make a profit on their produce. Even if big farmers or medium farmers have access to the minimum support price, it is not necessary that they will pass on that benefit to agricultural labourers, Ghosh said.In fact, there is no such study which shows that agricultural labourers are going to be affected from an increase in the minimum support price or even from farm loan waivers.Landlessness among Dalits has deep historical roots.For centuries, Dalits were expressly prohibited from owning land. Even if reforms after Independence have helped level the playing field, economic and social pressures over the last two decades have increased the proportion of landless farmers across all social sectors.The land is limited. As the population is increasing, pressure on land is also increasing, Himanshu said. It is expected that some increase would happen in the level of agricultural labourers over time.Regardless of caste or class, life is generally harder for landless farmers, according to Jayshree Sengupta of the Observer Research Foundations Economy and Development Programme.There is more incidence of suicides among agricultural labour than farmers/cultivators because they do not have access to any type of formal institutional loans and loan waivers have bypassed them. Around 70% of labourers are in debt, Sengupta said in an email."

At the same time, I discovered that there werent too many entertainment options available for children except cartoons, which are synthetic, and thats how I came up with the concept of salad stories.In a salad story, healthy foods are used to tell an informative and engaging story, to make meal time both educational, nutritious and a time of bonding.A total of 28 lucky early-bird kids aged 2.5 to 8 participated in the workshop with their parents.My daughter eats almost everything, but has preferences when it comes to vegetables.

This claim requires clarity, says Kavitha Kuruganti of the Alliance for Sustainable & Holistic Agriculture, in an interview with Zia Haq. Kuruganti was a member of the Ramesh Chand Committee on farm prices.The FM announced MSPS will be set at 1.5 times over costs of production, or 50% returns. He hasnt clarified if this increase will be over the so called C2 costs of cultivation, which is the main demand, or A2 costs. Can you explain why this is vital?In terms of cost accounting principles and practice, it is important to get a comprehensive picture of costs, which include opportunity costs. That will then give you a good picture of net returns. The Commission on Agricultural Costs and Prices itself calculates net returns in terms of C2 cost and not A2 (paid out components + family labour). C2 is a cost estimation, which (unlike A2) also includes rental value of own land and value of owned fixed capital assets. The reason why the government should exclude these two additional components also -while it includes imputed family labour on own land -in its selective cost definition, is irrational. Meanwhile, in the Ramesh Chand Committee report, we pointed out to various other ways in which cost is suppressed. That needs to be addressed too.People have argued that farmers costs are underestimated.While that is the theoretical part of the issue at debate here, what is important to realise is that official data is clearly showing that our farmers are in distress. Their income is not growing. A majority of farmers has negative net returns. The intersectoral disparities are increasing, which are not good in any society. There is also a moral imperative, that farmers are keeping us all alive, and we owe it to them.So are you saying the MSP claim is misleading?Prices are clearly the most proximal and direct ways to improve incomes. The government should stop trying to cheat farmers here. This government has given significantly lower margins on an average, whichever cost definition you adopt, compared to the earlier government. This, despite explicitly promising at least 50% margins over the cost of production. They have to make good on their promises.What are the kind of returns farmers are now getting? In terms of the ground reality, is it true that MSPS for the current rabi sown season gave 50% returns, as claimed by the finance minister?The NSSOS (National Sample Survey Office) 70th round shows that most farmers have monthly incomes lower than their monthly basic expenses. The average per day per capita earning in our farm households is lower than the legally prescribed minimum wages for agricultural workers in the country. The finance minister made an incorrect statement when he said that in this rabi, they have provided 50% margins since wheat, which had the highest MSP rise, has just 38% margin over C2 costs of cultivation. Not a single rabi crop has touched a 50% margin over C2.Would you agree that this Budget has put the rural economy and agriculture back on the governments priority?I will not agree. It is true that the current farmers unrest and struggles, in addition to recent election results, have put farmers back on the national debate, but the government hasnt incorporated any concrete thing that would address farmers problems. Only 2.3% of the entire budget has been given to agriculture. In fact, this government is being unresponsive and irresponsible towards farmers.Do you think Operation Greens for higher values through processing from tomato, onions and potatoes is a step towards focusing on incomes end of the spectrum?The details of this are yet to be seen. What we have been asking for is an MSP for these perishables also, which is guaranteed to farmers, in a statutory manner, along with other agri commodities."
5aeae8af9855b73f522c4a90,Budget 2018: Jaitley Promises Farmers 50% Returns over Cultivation Costs,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/budget-2018-jaitley-promises-farmers-50-returns-over-cultivation-costs/story-C5oo7V5HT9c9vRjF5CrNlM.html,2018-02-02,,Hindustan Times,"Kicking off with a burst of announcements for the farm sector, finance minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday said the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government would deliver on its promise of ensuring 50% returns for farmers, seeking to address rural angst due to collapsing prices.In his budget speech, Jaitley said federally determined minimum support prices (MSPs) for summer-sown (kharif) crops this year would be set at 1.5 times the cost of cultivation, which translates to 50% returns.This has been a key demand by protesting farmers in several agriculturally developed states, such as Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.Jaitley surprised critics by declaring that his government had already adhered to this pricing benchmark for most crops in the ongoing rabi-sown (winter) season. He said this would be henceforth applied for the rest of crops. The government has decided to keep MSP for the all unannounced crops of kharif at least at one and half times of their production cost, he said.The finance minister did not announce any specific price-deficit payment scheme to compensate farmers directly for market losses when prices dip below MSPs, as was widely anticipated. Such a scheme is already being implemented in Madhya Pradesh. He, instead, said that Niti Ayog would soon come out with a foolproof mechanism on how to compensate farmers when prices crash.The budget announcement comes amid a rough patch in the agriculture sector, forecast to grow just 2.1% in 2017-18, as against 4.9% in the previous year. The announcement of 50% returns over costs set off a flurry of debate on the fine print, with farm leaders wondering which of the two measures of cultivation costs  the so-called C2 or A2 + FL  the government would adopt. Jaitley did not specify the measure that will be used.C2 is a more comprehensive measure of a farmers cultivation costs, which includes imputed rental value of land, depreciation and interests on capital. These are not part of the A2+FL, a narrower measure that includes input costs and imputed value of only family labour.The crux of the battle on prices boils down to the governments definition on cost of productionThe government seems to have chosen a lower cost measure so that it can declare that it is already providing cost + 50% in this rabi, said Kiran Vissa of the Rythu Swarajya Vedika, part of a platform of farmer organisations. He said when PM Narendra Modi had promised 50% returns in his election campaign, MSPs were already giving higher returns than under Modis tenure.In 2007, the MS Swaminathan Committee had recommended 50% returns for crops, which the BJPs 2014 poll manifesto adopted. In the para containing the specific recommendation, the Swaminathan report said MSP should be 50% over costs of cultivation, not specifying which measure. But in its annexure, the report used C2 costs to calculate net farmer returns.Economist Ashok Gulati told HT that for rabi crops, the MSP was closer towards 50% of costs. In wheat, it is in the region of 44%-45%, but in other crops it is just 20%-30%. The real challenge is for kharif crops. In paddy, MSPs and returns are not more than 10%-12%, he said. If the government actually sets MSPs at 1.5 times the C2 costs, then it would also mean a huge jump in the food subsidy bill and make Indias produce expensive in the exports market, he said.The budget announced a new scheme called Operation Greens to promote value addition for tomato, onion and potato. This would be similar to Operation Flood that revolutionsed the dairy sector, Jaitley said. Two funds to boost fisheries and animal husbandry were allotted Rs10,000.The budget also set a target of Rs11 lakh crore for agriculture credit in 2018-19, a 10% rise. Jaitley said 22,000 new and existing rural marketplaces would be developed to give farmers access to buyers. Tenant farmers would be made eligible for farm loans under a new policy, he said, adding a liberalised farm-exports regime was in the works. Various ministries will have Rs14.34 lakh crore in all to create rural jobs and infrastructure.With a view to boost food processing, which can improve commodity prices, allocation to the food processing ministry was being doubled from Rs715 crore in 2017-18 to Rs1,400 crore in 2018-19, Jaitley said."

Tracing gold supply is key to preventing metal that funds armed conflict from entering world markets, identifying owners and maintaining security from mine to vault.The LBMA has pushed ahead with efforts to modernize a trade that until recent years relied on phone auctions to set a key benchmark price for the market.For us, its a question of where the gold comes from, Mirza said.The LBMA oversees a list of refiners approved to supply the London market. Its London Good Delivery List sets global standards for large gold and silver bars. The LBMA will also study tagging the metal and using other security features to ensure bars are exactly what they say they are, it said in a statement on Tuesday.Everything that ends up in an LBMA good-delivery refiner needs to be tracked in the supply chain, regardless of whether it ends up as a large bar in a London vault, a kilo bar shipped to the Far East, or a coin owned by a collector, Mirza said. A lot has been done already but its still very paper-based. We now want to formalize it through an efficient and possibly technologically based solution. Bloomberg"

In fact, DySP Srinivas, Puttur Rural Circle Inspector Gopal Naik, Uppinangady Sub Inspector Nandakumar and other police personnel were camping in Mithamajalu since morning.When ANF members showed the photographs of a few Maoists to the inmates of the house, they (residents) said that the Maoists have identified themselves as ""Rajesh"" and ""Latha"".Mithamajalu, situated two-kilometres away from National Highway has 40 houses, of which three houses are situated on the periphery of the forest. The Maoist members had visited the houses on Sunday night. However, it was kept a secret till Monday evening. It was through schoolchildren that the news was spread among the villagers.Puttur DySP Srinivas said that the visit of Maoists to the houses has been confirmed. Two teams of ANF have started combing operations.'Did not threaten'One of the residents of the house that the Maoists visited said, ""The members just informed that they were Maoists and asked us not to inform anyone. They did not threaten us.""A team with two men and a woman entered the house at 7.30 pm on Sunday. After introducing themselves as Purushotham, Rajesh and Latha, they asked for groceries. ""When I informed that there is no rice and asked them whether they needed dosa and tea, they replied in the negative."" They also wanted to know whether there is any rich person's house in the village, the resident said.When my brother visited the house, they accompanied him to his house. They were in my house for 10 minutes only. All were wearing green trousers and shirt and were armed, the resident said.Her brother said, ""Maoist Rajesh asked for 10 kg of rice. When I said there are no shops nearby, they demanded rice from the house. They have taken 3 kg boiled rice, 8 kg white rice, tomato and potato from my house.""Enquiries madeThe trio were also asking for Biju, whom they said had reportedly informed the police about their visit to Subrahmanya last time.As a result, one of their collegue Yellappa was killed in crossfire with the ANF (in 2012).Another resident said: ""I encountered three members of the Maoists first. My parents had gone to the temple on account of Sankranti. When I heard dogs barking, I came out of the house and saw three armed persons at my yard. When they introduced themselves as Maoists, I ran towards my uncle's house."""

Researchers in the city have come up with a do-it-yourself solution to protect yourself from poison that might be on your plate. Mix 160 ml of acetic acid with 4 grams of baking soda and concentrated juice of 4 lemons in 4 litres of water. Use this to was your vegetables to ensure that pesticides are removed.A student of Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University (PJTSAU) conducted a study to find out efficacy of tap water and various liquid solutions that can be made at home to remove pesticide residues from vegetables.Comparison of the efficacy of these methods revealed that the solution of acetic acid, baking soda, lemon juice and water in right proportions was much more efficient in removing the pesticide residues compared to the use of only tap water.The study by Sudhakar S Kelageri of PJTSAU published recently in the Journal of Entomology and Zoology Studies reports that dipping tomatoes for 10 minutes in a solution of 160 ml of acetic acid with 4 grams of baking soda and lemon juice from 4 lemons in 4 litres of water followed by washing off the tomatoes with tap water, could remove pesticides residues in the range of 55-76 percent.This formulation is developed by All India Network Project on Pesticide Residues at PJTSAU and is named as Veggy wash. Compared to Veggy wash, the efficacy of washing vegetables with only tap water was just around 17-39 per cent.Effectiveness of Veggy wash was checked on five pesticides - Dimethoate, lambda-Cyhalothrin, Flubendiamide and Profenophos which are widely used by farmers on tomato, a vegetable that finds high usage in Indian cooking as well as in salads for raw consumption. While the published study was on tomato, these five pesticides find wide usage in other vegetables as well.It was found that Veggy wash could remove 76.7 per cent of dimethoate, 68.8 percent of lambda-Cyhalothrin, 55.1 per cent of phosalone, 65.3 per cent of flubendiamide and 75.8 per cent of profenofos. It may be mentioned here that profenofos is widely used on vegetables in India although it is not recommended for usage on vegetables by Central Insecticide Board and Registration Committee and it is listed as moderately hazardous by World Health Organization. Another effective solution listed in the study was 4 percent acetic acid solution prepared by mixing 160 ml of acetic acid in 4 litres of water."

The Sabarmati ashram is sited between a jail and a crematorium, and Gandhi believed that a Satyagraha invariably had to go to either place. He is believed to have said, This is the right place for our activities to carry on the search for Truth and develop fearlessness, for on one side are the iron bolts of the foreigners, and on the other the thunderbolts of Mother Nature.It was also from here that he launched the famous Dandi March or Salt Satyagraha in 1930, in protest against the increased taxes on Indian salt in an effort to promote sales of British salt in India.Adalaj VavGujarat has some beautiful step wells and this is certainly one of them. This intricately carved five storeys deep step well was started in the 15th century by Rana Veer Singh to alleviate the misery of his subjects who had to face severe water shortage and completed by a Muslim king, Mehmud Begda in the Indo-Islamic architectural style.Built in sandstone it is octagonal at the top, and stands on a large number of gorgeously carved pillars. Spacious, each floor can accommodate sizeable congregations. The floral motifs and Islamic graphics blend rather well with the Hindu symbols carved at various levels of the well. The carvings depict women in daily chores like churning of buttermilk, adorning themselves, dancers and musicians performing, and the King overlooking all these activities. Dont be surprised if you find hordes of tourists filling every possible space in the huge stepwell, most of them in the serious pursuit of either posing for pictures or indulging in taking selfies.Sidi Saiyyed MosqueThis mosque is famous for beautifully carved ten stone latticework windows on the side and rear arches. This intricately carved lattice stone window is the Sidi Saiyyed Jali, the unofficial symbol of city of Ahmedabad and the inspiration for the design of the logo of the Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad. Our visit coincided with the Maghrib prayers: in the midst of a chaotic traffic, the mosque lent serenity and the soft light from the ambience further enhanced its beauty.Teen DarwazaKing Ahmed Shah built this historical gate in the 15 century. This is where we found the most chaotic and undisciplined traffic. The roads were overflowing with people, hawkers, small time shopkeepers with mountains of goods, and ruthless two wheeler drivers with intimidating horns.Manek ChowkHere the street food stalls at night are a big attraction. It is a vegetable market in the morning, a jewellery market (supposed to be the second biggest in India) in the noon and a street food market at night. The food stalls start to emerge around 9:30 in the evening and continue till late night. The mouth-watering snacks make you ignore the not so clean surroundings. Besides many delicacies, Manek Chowk is best known for its kulfi but we had fafda (that came with a chutney setting the tongue on fire) and hot jalebis: an unusual combination.PolsIt is worth seeing a Pol in the old Ahmedabad. They contain old beautiful houses with internal courts having intricate wooden carved facades with columns and fresco work done around court walls or ceilings. Pol architecture is an interesting evolution in urban living space.The word pol is derived from the Sanskrit word pratoli meaning entrance to an enclosed area. Pols were originally made as a protection measure when communal riots necessitated greater security probably dating from 1738 during Mughal-Maratha rule (1738-1753) in Ahmedabad. A typical pol would have only one or two entrances and also some secret entrances known only to people residing in a pol.Sasu Ji for lunchOne of the best places to taste an authentic Gujarati thaali as the warm and hospitable staff pampers you. We started with many bowls of baasundi, tiny Malpuas dripping with sugar syrup; Cheese Wonton (?? Chinese?? Yes!!), Shahi Dhokla, Patra for starters (Farsan), for the main course it was Paneer Pasanda, Undhiyu (a mixed vegetable dish with muthia-dumplings made with fenugreek leaves and spiced besan), Batata Tameta (tomato?), methi papad, poories, rice, rotisof course, you cant finish all this, however generous Sasu ji is!Mirch Masala for dinnerA themed restaurant, based on old Hindi films, here you have paintings of Kaka (Rajesh Khanna) and other film stars staring at you from every wall. We polished platefuls of kebabs as Hrithik Roshan watched us lovingly.Law GardenShopping cant get any better. The goods are attractive, prices quite reasonable.

TGIFridays has recently launched their hangover brunch every weekend, which has all the right appetisers, entrees and desserts to satisfy your hungover heart, as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks to either refresh you, or keep the buzz going.We started the meal with some mocktails  the Basil Peach Cooler and the Gold Mango Margarita, both of which were a tad bit too strong for our tastes, but were also high on flavour and taste. We tried the Chocolate Milkshake next, which was rich, thick and decadent  just how a good milkshake should be.If you are looking to keep their spirits high by taking care of your hangover with another drink, try Hangover Bloody Mary. This drink, is a meal in itself. The tall glass, the classic tomato juice-based cocktail is served in, is decorated with a lamb slider, chicken wings, fries and celery sticks - an ideal meal for one. The red wine sangria is also a good option  sweeter and full of fruit than sangrias served in most other places.TGIF has a number of options in appetisers. From egg-heavy dishes such as Breakfast Tacos and Breakfast Potato Skins, to fried food for the hungover soul. We tried the Calamari Frites, and though hesitant to try shellfish in places not directly on the coast, we found this dish to be fresh, crispy and delicious, complemented perfectly with marinara sauce. We also tried the Friday Mushrooms - crispy batter fried mushrooms served with a sauce.For mains, we first tried the Classic American Veg Pizza, and though not up to par with the some of the great pizza Bengaluru has been serving up of late, it does have a very homemade feel to it. The Pasta Alfredo is not for the faint hearted or the almost-full, as it is very creamy and rich, just the way an Alfredo ought to be. The winner among the mains for us was the Hangover Burger, again, meant for someone with a hearty appetite. This delicious monster has a juicy lamb patty paired with bacon, caramelized onions and all your other burger fixings, and is topped off with a fried egg. Some of the other good options among the mains are the Steak and Eggs and the Crispy Chicken Sliders.For dessert, we thought wed keep it simple, and the brunch menu has also stuck to the same theme by only listing two dishes. We tried the Sizzling Brownie, and it was one of the best weve had in recent times, and also much bigger than most. Served with large scoop of vanilla ice cream and generous amounts of chocolate sauce, it was the perfect end to this gastronomic meal.The Hangover brunch is on every Saturday and Sunday, 12 noon to 3 pm. Prices start at ` 1,695."

Photo: AlamyAmong the many ways of looking at Frankenstein, and by Frankenstein one necessarily means not just Mary Shelleys groundbreaking book but what that book birthed over 200 yearsas other authors, playwrights, theatre producers and film-makers prodded away at it, moving body parts around in their sinister laboratorieshere is one interpretation. It is about terrible and unhappy parents, terrible and unhappy children, and how, to misquote Philip Larkin, we pass misery back and forth.Youre Victor Frankenstein, you think youve done your best, but heres this monster you created, which refuses to be what you hoped it would be. Worse, it turns around and blames you for everything thats wrong. Look at the Paradise Lost lineDid I request thee, Maker, from my clay, To mould me Man?which serves as an epigraph for Shelleys novel, and then listen to director Guillermo del Toro, who is currently working on a Frankenstein film: Its the quintessential teenage book. You dont belong. You were brought to this world by people that dont care for you and you are thrown into a world of tears and hunger.Most parent-child relationships, when looked at over a period of time, bring high tragedy and slapstick comedy together in the same frame. Little wonder then that cinematic Frankensteins have inhabited every mode from deep seriousness to goofy, pseudo-science-driven humourand that the most enduring films accommodate both extremes.Consider one of the most effective scenes, gentle, idyllic and horrifying all at once, in James Whales 1931 Frankenstein. Boris Karloffs monster comes across a little girl, joins her in placing flowers on a lakes surface and watching them floatand then, in all innocence, dunks her into the water too, causing her death. So iconic was this momentoften censored in early screeningsthat 40 years later the Spanish director Vctor Erice made it the focal point of his coming-of-age narrative The Spirit Of The Beehive: the six-year-old protagonist Ana is traumatized when she watches the scene; in the days that follow, she becomes aware of subtler monsters in her own world.Or see Whales 1935 sequel, Bride Of Frankenstein, in which Karloffs plaintivenessas the monster yearns for a companion who will love and understand himbrushes up against Elsa Lanchesters brief but delightfully lunatic performance as his bride-not-to-be (the actress also played an impish Mary Shelley in a short scene).Those are still the two best-known Frankenstein films, and to modern eyes they can seem creaky and overwrought. Taking cues from theatre adaptations staged in Mary Shelleys lifetime, they turned Victor Frankenstein into the prototype of the mad scientist, shrieking that he knows what its like to be God (in the book he is a diligent, conscientious man). But Karloffs performance helps erase some of the differences. While the creature in Shelleys novel gains in eloquence and dignity once he learns to use language, the dumb movie monster is sympathetic by other means, conveying childlike pathos through his gestures and expressions. In fact, one can argue that in the broader-comedy scenes where he grunts wordsthe refrain of Good! Good! when an old hermit makes him taste bread and winehe becomes less likable.A still from Mary Shelleys Frankenstein. Photo: AlamyOf course, there are other films where the monster is not meant to be at all likablesee the 1957 Curse Of Frankenstein, starring those two masters of the Hammer Horror franchise, Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, and watch Lee play the role as a deformed, inexpressive zombie, starting with the shocking moment where he rips the bandages off his face as the camera zooms in on him.Another dominant mode is that of parody mixed with affection for the source material. Mel Brooks 1974 Young Frankenstein, shot in atmospheric black and white, has madcap scenes like the one where the doctors assistant brings along a brain labelled Abnormalthinking it belonged to someone named Abbie Normalbut the film also understands the sense of wonder and danger that permeates the original story. This is equally true of three 1980s filmsGothic, Haunted Summer and Rowing With The Windwhich arent straight renderings of the Frankenstein tale but dramatize the famous 1816 summer house party involving the Shelleys and Lord Byron, where both Frankenstein and the John Polidori horror story The Vampyre were conceived.And, of course, there are serious Frankenstein movies, which usually err on the side of earnestness. Kenneth Branaghs 1994 Mary Shelleys Frankenstein set out to be faithful to the book, in a way the Karloff films never did, but the promise was marred by half-hearted executionand ironically its best moments were the more inventive ones such as the scene where the naked creature (played by Robert De Niro, channelling a middle-aged Travis Bickle) slips about like a newborn baby in what looks like amniotic fluid.Frankenstein is often regarded as the first true science-fiction novel, and this perception has become increasingly relevant in our time, where Artificial Intelligence has taken on forms that Mary Shelley couldnt have envisioned. The idea of an imitation human being more humane in some ways than the flesh-and-blood people around him is a theme that has informed a lot of modern sci-fi about automatons: from the replicants in Blade Runner to the 1999 Bicentennial Man (adapted from Isaac Asimovs The Positronic Man) and Steven Spielbergs A.I. Artificial Intelligence (based on Brian Aldisss Supertoys Last all Summer Long, and often seen as a futuristic version of the Pinocchio story).But its just as instructive to go back in time, to two decades before the Karloff films, when a 12-minute Frankenstein was made by Thomas Edisons studio in 1910. Watching this relic (youll find it on YouTube) is like getting into a time machine: given that the world of the Shelleys seems so impossibly distant to us today, its unsettling to realize that the Edison film is closer in time (a mere 92 years) to the publication of the book than to our present day.What I find fascinating about that ancient filmas a cinema student and as someone who thinks of the Frankenstein story as being rooted in honest scientific curiosityis how much it does with the very limited motion-picture technology of the time. For instance, for the challenging scene in which the monster comes alive, a wax replica of a skeleton was placed in a vat and set afire until it dissolved and crumpled. They then played the film backward, so that the impression we get is of something hideous being forged out of fire and sitting upright after its limbs have formed.To watch that scene is to think of the imagination and daring required of early film-makers when they wanted to do something more ambitious than simply record reality. One could say those pioneers were kindred spirits of Victor Frankenstein, tinkering in their workshops until their children grew and became something vast and uncontrollable, slipping out of their godlike hands."
5aeb03a09855b73f522c5e43,Parottas from Deep Down South,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2018/jan/19/parottas-from-deep-down-south-1758979.html,2018-01-20,,The New Indian Express,"lSabyasachi Roy Chaudhuri ByExpress News ServiceHYDERABAD: Parottas or layered flour breads are popular in the southern states of India as well as the island country of Sri Lanka. Whereas Malabar parotta from Kerala is the most well-known among these, there are other variants like kothu, veechu, lappa and Ceylon parottas which are in demand in these places. It is said that the parotta recipes of South India did not migrate from the northern part of the country, instead, it was the Sinhalese workers in the southern part of Tamil Nadu and Kerala who brought these recipes from the island. The Arab traders visiting the coastline also had a role to play in this.Each type of parotta has its own unique style of preparation. For example, for making Veechu Parotta, a popular dish from Madurai, the dough is spun in the air to make the parotta thinner. The thin layered bread is then folded and fried in oil. This dish is popular in Southern Tamil Nadu and gets its name from veesu, which in Tamil means tossing in the air. Ceylon Paratha is a two-layered parotta usually stuffed with vegetables or meat. The parottas is normally served with a gravy known as salna as well as onion raita.Kothu Parotta is a completely different dish altogether. Roasted parottas are chopped into small pieces and sauted on a tawa with masala, and other ingredients like onions, tomatoes, chillies, egg and even meat. Beachside shacks in Sri Lanka are known for the varieties of Kothu Parottas that they rustle up. Seeing the parotta being prepared in front of you and the sound of chopping and mixing itself makes you feel hungry.Lappa is typically made with an egg filling and is widely known as muttai lappa in parts of Tamil Nadu. After preparation, the parotta is again covered with another layer of egg batter, before folding into triangular or square shapes and fried. The recipe has influences of Arabic cuisine with strong similarities with muttabaq, a popular Arabic dish.Pondy Parottas, with two outlets at Madhura Nagar and Hi-Tec City, brings all these types of parottas to Hyderabad. As per Rajasubbaiah who owns this place, the kothu parotta here is prepared in the special Karaikal style, where the masala is cooked on the tawa folded inside the parotta and then chopped into pieces. For Lappa, the stuffing is uniformly spread on the parotta directly on the tawa. They have chicken, mutton and seafood versions of the parottas, as well as kalaki, an omelette type egg delicacy popular in Tamil Nadu.Sabyasachi is a food enthusiast and blogs at www.foodaholix.in"

How does one make art so that it breathes politics and forces the viewer to return the gesture -- with an act of seeing? At the Art Heritage gallery this weekend, a group show of nine artists, mostly from Kerala, offer diverse perspectives.Gigi Scaria, GR Iranna, Baiju Parthan, Jyothi Basu, KP Reji, NN Rimzon, Pooja Iranna, Sumedh Rajendran and TV Santhoshs works form the second edition of the exhibition Negotiation in Contested Space  Part 1. Conceptualised by Renuka Sawhney, a writer who works in New York, it was first held in Mumbai in 2017. Veteran stage and costume designer and director, Art Heritage, Amal Allana has curated it for the Delhi edition.As in India today, Contested Space is about the different pulls that are dividing up the space or the ground we stand on, says Allana while pointing out to an artwork that illustrates this. KP Rejis Moving the Mountain is a startling image of what seems to be dead bodies wrapped in cloths of bright yellow hoisted atop a vehicle with no exit  no door or window  pulled from both sides by hooks.KP Rejis Moving the Mountain (Photo courtesy: KP Reji)Its almost as if an entire culture is being moved or trundled away by an armoured vehicle. The image does not identify the source of the threat but signifies that by the introduction of the curled hook, says Allana.In another of Rejis works, Fishes Under the Broken Bridge, children are seen at various stages of play in a semi-rural setting framed by coconut palms and hovering seagulls, while in the backdrop a plane crashes seemingly out of nowhere and men, unperturbed, keep standing on a bridge holding up their rods waiting for fish. The picture is rife with a sense of unease  the fishing rods seen from a particular angle seem like raised swords just before a strike.Gigi Scaria, Under the Water (Photo courtesy: Gigi Scaria)Pooja Iranna, Gates to yet another Spectacular World (Photo courtesy: Pooja Iranna)The theme of imminent danger, catastrophe or sudden collapse runs through all the art-works at the exhibition. Pooja Irannas Gates to Yet Another Spectacular World is an installation built with staple pins. As Sawhney writes in the catalogue, she uses the conformity and mundaneness of her material to create a double illusion. Stacked together, individual staples create a formidable sculpture or structure. But should one staple fall out or move out of place, the whole edifice may come apart. This mirrors the tentativeness and the instability of existence, adds Allana.Sumedh Rajendrans mixed media collage on grey, robotic workers marching to office as if they were soldiers, add another strand  that of precarity of urban existence  to the exhibition. Some of them are torso-less and headless and yet they seem to move automaton-like forward; to stop or pause in such circumstances would be unthinkable. The work alludes to the desperate and daily departure of human beings to fixed spaces such as the office, explains Allana.GR Irannas (untitled) work portraying a bundle of old journals with a flower sprouting from a corner is the only image of promise and expectation in this bleak, though striking exhibition. The paper may seem used and discarded but out of the Book of Knowledge springs hope, says Allana. And what can be more symbolic than that?Details: Till March 2, Art Heritage, 205, Tansen Marg, Triveni Kala Sangam. 11 am-7 pm, Sundays closed. Nearest metro station: Mandi House"
5aeb09f19855b73f522c632c,Bengaluru: Veggies get pocket-friendly,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2018/jan/19/bengaluru-veggies-get-pocket-friendly-1758226.html,2018-01-19,,The New Indian Express,"Ashwini M Sripad ByExpress News ServiceBENGALURU: With the supply of vegetables crossing three times the demand, vegetable prices have drastically dropped. Experts say that at least for the next two months the markets are expected to be filled with vegetables costing fraction of their prices prevailing a few days ago. In Karnataka, vegetable growers are more in Kolar, Bengaluru Rural, Chikballapur, Chitradurga, Ramanagara, Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar, Hassan and other places. With good rain this monsoon, growers could get good yield too. The price of many vegetables has come around Rs 20 per kilo which was more than Rs 70 a few months back. While the tomato has declined to Rs 11 per kilo, pumpukin is Rs 13 per kg, raddish is Rs 18, snake gourd is Rs 18, while beetroot and potato are Rs 22 per kg, according to the Horticultural Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS) price list.Former additional director (Fruits), Dr S V Hittalamani, explained that this was because the state witnessed good monsoon rainfall in 2017. The lakes and rivers had filled, and groundwater had charged up.With this, farmers used borewell for water and it was an advantage for vegetable growers to grow larger quantities of vegetables. If there is more supply than demand, naturally the price declines. This is what has happened now, he said.Citing an example, Hittalamani said tomatoes grown on 6,000 hectares of land yielded around one lakh tones of tomatoes. But this year, with more farmers using their land for growing tomatoes, they have used 18,000 hectares of land and grown three lakh tones of tomatoes as compared to last year. If the quantity is thrice, one can imagine the price slash. In winter season, tomatoes normally grow. This year, growers in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra have also grown good quantities of tomatoes. This means there is no demand for our tomatoes in these states, he said.People, vendors happyAruna, a resident of Rajarajeshwarinagar bought carrot, onion, potato, peas, beans, chilies and curry leaves, all half kg to one kg. Even after buying so much, my bill was hardly D100. I was happy to buy veggies this cheap, she said. She said just a couple of months back, she used to spend D250 for the same quantity of vegetables. The vendors too are happy. Carrot was D90 per kg just a couple of months ago, now it has dropped to D45. Similarly, potato was D80 per kg and it has fallen to D22. People do come to buy vegetables even if the price is increased, Rudresh, a vegetable vendor at Vijayanagar said. Another vendor, Mahesh at Shivajinagar, said customers are happy. We too are happy that they are buying more in quantity, he said.From less supply to tomato glutAccording to deputy director of horticulture department Chandrashekar, just a few months ago there was demand for tomatoes as there was less supply. The price of tomatoes had reached D90 per kg. It was then that farmers started growing tomoatoes thinking there would be good price in the market. Tomatoes need three months to grow. There was good rain, that added as an advantage to them. There is good supply and price has naturally come down, he said. In summer, with some virus or the other, the yield of tomatoes will come down, and the price of tomatoes will increase during that time."

However, the night temperature this season has mostly hovered around 7 degrees Celsius, four degrees above normal, while the day temperature has come close to 20 degrees Celsius.The region, extending from Kashmir to Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, has witnessed no snow in the last three months. Rainfall, on the other hand, has been up to 100% deficient. As apples are a rain or snow-fed crop, this development has caused much concern among cultivators.A dry apple farm in Himachal Pradesh. (HT File Photo)The planting of apple saplings  which is usually done when the soil is rich with moisture  have been delayed, and the infusion of fertilisers in the soil has been poor. For the first time in 20 years, we did not witness any rain or snow through December and January. So far, the region has seen only 300 chilling hours, bemoaned Balwant Chauhan, an apple grower from Rohru.Prem Chandra Sharma, a 68-year-old farmer from Hatal Sainj village in Uttarakhand, also predicted difficult times ahead.According to experts, the warm winter may also impact the production of other crops  including pears, apricots, green almonds, tomatoes, cabbage and cauliflower. Such weather conditions will hit apple production adversely as Himachals orchards depend completely on rainfall. Moisture is a must for cultivation of fruits, said horticulturist SP Bhardwaj.Apple economicsApple constitutes 90% of the fruit crop in Himachal and Kashmir, and is the main source of livelihood for people from seven out of 12 districts in Himachal and nine out of 14 districts in Kashmir.Himachal witnessed a record production of 892 metric tonnes of apples in 2010-11, but plummeted to 275 metric tonnes the very next year. Ever since, it has shown no sign of recovering.Kashmir also witnessed a drop in production in recent years with overall temperatures rising across the Himalayan region.The dry weather may also impact rabi crop cultivation in the hills. The drought-like situation is likely to hit wheat production, said Himachal Pradesh agriculture department director Dr Des Raj Sharma.Meanwhile, the governments of these states are looking at alternative measures to alleviate the situation. JC Sharma, principal secretary of the Himachal Pradesh horticulture department, said the government was trying to make up for the lack of rainfall by setting up irrigation infrastructure and root stock plantations under a World Bank project.Uttarakhand agriculture minister Subodh Uniyal, on the other hand, said the state government will prepare a report on losses incurred by farmers on the basis of district-level inputs.Other sectorsThe absence of snowfall has affected tourism in the region too, with visitors staying away from their winter hotspots.We have no choice but to wait for the snow to rev up the season, complained Nishant Sharma, a Himachal-based tours and travel operator.Manali Hoteliers Association president Gajender Thakur had a similar tale of woe to relate. Many tourists cancelled their bookings after they realised there would be no snowfall in the coming week, he said.The situation wasnt much better in neighbouring Uttarakhand either. The international winter skiing championship, scheduled to be held at Auli from January 16, has been deferred by a month.Met forecastThe India Meteorological Department (IMD), however, has promised rainfall and snow from January 22.Global warming may be giving rise to warmer winters, but regional factors like western disturbances and the El Nino also impact temperatures, said IMD (Delhi) official DS Pai.Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist at the Skymet Weather Services, said this winter was warmer due to lack of active western disturbances that cause snowfall. The western disturbances that impacted the Himalayas this time were not strong enough to cause precipitation in the northern states. However, they did disrupt the flow of cold northwesterly winds, making temperatures in the Indo-Gangetic plain plummet, he said.Twelve of the 15 warmest years recorded in India occurred between 2001 and 2016, in keeping with global weather patterns."

Locals have earned Rs 6 crore by selling tomatoes and cauliflowers that they grow in plenty.Steps would be initiated to promote agriculture tourism to check migration. We plan to organise fairs like ginger fair, pomegranate fair, apple fair to attract tourists. The fairs will be organised by horticulturists and farmers in areas where they get bumper crops.Besides, the tourism department would boost income of the people in rural areas by promoting programmes such as eco-tourism and home stay facilities. It will help attract foreign tourists to rural areas in the state. Similarly, programmes like Mera Gaon, Mera Teerth which the Parishad has been organising to pave the way for reverse migration would be replicated elsewhere.Parishad general secretary Ramprasad Penuli said a large number of the people from Pahari diaspora who left their villages long ago for various reasons have started participating in Gramotsava. They not only participate in these religious fairs but also contribute towards development of their ancestral villages.He said the government agreed to promote such programmes because migration is a major problem facing the state.

This is because the state government hasnt fixed any rates for vegetables, Narayana Gowda, one of the farmers in Kolar district, said.Since there is no minimum support price (MSP) for food grains and crops, the pricing of fruits and vegetables is left to the market forces.Narayana Gowda, who is from Hosmatanahalli in Kolar district, said, over `70,000 is spent to grow vegetables in an acre. The cost includes pesticides and other agro-based expenses. We grow and take care of it for three months day and night. But in return, we get pittance. The middlemen are rampant.Now that the supply is more than the demand in the market, the middlemen are purchasing tomato, beans and brinjal for `3 each (per kg), capcicum for `15 and ladies finger for `5 (per kg). We are not getting any profit. Whatever we are getting we are spending it on transporation and also for the coolies at our farms. The coriander leaves are sold at `10 per bundle. One can imagine our plight. Where should we go? he asked.Srinivasa, another farmer demanded that farmers flea market be held at every panchayath or hobli level once a week or fortnight. At least we can go sell our products directly to the consumers, and get some profit. We can also avoid the middlemen, he said.Chennagowda, a farmer who grows tomatoes in Kolar, said tomato price came down to `4 per kilo to `3 a few days ago. In fact, it even went down to `2 last month. We put in a lot of effort to grow it for 100 days, but this is what we get. Every political party leader comes to us before elections with assurances, but nothing is done. If we do not get money, how can we take care of our wives and children,  he said."

Photo: Samar HalarnkarI am a storehouse of what my wife calls useless information. I get withering looks when I tell her which B- or C-lister is dating, whos getting married, what their workouts are and where they vacationed this winter. She has no interest in the fact that the svelte actor who rules the Kannada film industry is, like her, a Sindhi. Shes Galrani, youre Ramani, and you both do yoga, I tell herbut she has already left the room.Oh well.You see, in this breathless era of the smartphone and Twitter, I read five local newspapers, which is where I glean these nuggets. I read the pages that the few people still reading newspapers immediately discardthe city and lifestyle sections. Dominated by lurid gossip and paid-for puff publicity, these pages often have realalbeit badly writtenlocal news.Thats how I knewwhile reading the Deccan Herald city section at the doctorsthat the annual avarebele mela was on, a street-food festival based on a single bean, the avarekai, avarekalu or avarebele, Kannada words for the hyacinth or field bean.Bengaluru is known for its festivals celebrating agricultural products. These fairs offer relaxed markets where farmers, traders and city slickers mingle. We have an annual kadalekai parishe, or peanut fair, and last week, while running through the citys sprawling Cubbon Park, I dodged enthusiasts thronging a millets fair and millets marathonthe agriculture minister, whose trim frame betrays a proclivity to fitness, enthusiastically participated in the latter.My wife, who always persuades me to patronize the local Ramzan and Christmas festivitieswhich she can appreciate through only sight and soundhas always wanted to indulge her own culinary tastes, which are vegetarian and appreciative of local farmers and traditions. The problem is the bean and peanut festivals are across town, and given my reluctance to engage with Bengalurus formidable traffic, we had not been there.One bright winter morning, I bundled her into an autorickshaw and off we went to Sajjan Rao Circle in VV Puram, where old traditions, homes and trees linger. This is a vegetarian Kannadiga stronghold, and that is evident in the meat-free offerings on thindi beedi, or food street, a 100m stretch of carts, small eateries and condiment stores. One of these, Sri Vasavi Condiments, organizes the annual avarebele mela that focuses entirely on a green-and-white broad bean, made with skin or without. The bean is particularly appropriate for a city that is often called bean town in the English translation from one of its supposed root names, bende kaal ooru, or town/village of boiled beans (although this is likely bunkum).Everything at the fair was about the avare bean, and nothing was costlier than Rs60. The avarebele was mixed with dosa, idli and bonda batters; worked into curries, ragi and rice rotis; blended with pulaos, upmas, payasams and evengreenhoney jalebis. Oh, how could I forget the union of north and south, the avarebele rumali roti, and, of course, that pinnacle of fusion, avarebele manchurian. I daresay no other festival boasts of the wild experimentation of the green bean soire, although I refused to experiment with the last two. We jostled around the coupon issuers, grabbed our precious tokens and waved them frantically at the chefs until we got, on leaf plates, our avarebele dosa with hithkabeleor beans without skinsaru (curry), avarebele ragi roti and avarebele idlis. We packed avarebele chikki, spiced hithkabele snacks and raw beans and plunged into the midday traffic to make our way back home.The next day, I cooked the beans and tossed them with some sea salt, hoping to create my own avarebele entre. The first thing I did was to integrate them with our daily dosa, as you can see in the recipe below. I think the Sri Vasavi Condiments dosa was made from beans with the skinavarelebe dosa, while mine was hithkabele, without the skin.I was happy to have finally made the long-pending journey to the mela. The avarebele has been a gap in my acquaintance with state tradition; about 90% of the southern crop comes from Karnataka. I have eaten the basic curry now and then, but I was not acquainted with the beans diverse uses. The avarebele is nutritious, packed as it is with vitamins and iron, and it is a particularly important source of protein for vegetarians. In Bengaluru, even those who dont eat iteven in my homeapparently know of the great, green bean.After we returned home the day of the fair, I was telling my pork-eating seven-year-old of our trip and how we had eaten all manner of delicious food made with green-and-white beans; you know, I told her, the same beans we sometimes pick up from Cubbon Park when we go cycling. Oh, she said, you mean avarekai.Hithkabele DosaMakes 4IngredientsBatter to make four dosas1 cup of peeled hyacinth beans (hithkabele)2 tbsp onion, chopped1/2 green chilli, chopped finely1 tbsp coriander, chopped finely1 tbsp tomato, chopped finelySea salt to taste1/2 tsp gheeMethodPlace the beans in a pressure-cooker steamer with water below.

Being a Bengali, food is forms an integral part of my life. I was never a ghar ka khana person, but always a bahar ka khana! she laughs. After a decade in corporate, she decided to don a chef s cap. She missed international cuisine when she got back home. So, I would Google recipes, hunt for ingredients across the city or sometimes go to Delhi to get it! I loved throwing parties, and cook food! I enjoyed the whole process of planning the menu and cooking, she says. But eating at the famous Massana Restaurant a Michelin starred restaurant in Girona, Spain, sealed the deal.That food made such a huge impact on me  the presentation, hospitality, taste  it was like nothing Ive ever experienced anywhere else, she gushes. She decided that she wanted to create such a memorable impact on other people. She visited the kitchens of a chef she knew at the Country Inn and Sweets and learned to chop, shred, and other nuances for the next four months. The first time, I walked in with my kitchen knife, the whole kitchen laughed! she recalls. That was the first time she chopped with a large cleaver, and she had to chop small pieces of garlic. After that, she did several culinary courses in French cooking, a duck master class in Australia and catering for private events. And when she got back to India, she received a casting call for MasterChef India! It was out of the blue, I cant believe I went to the Top 30! she recalls, and though she was heartbroken that she didnt continue, she trained under world-class chefs like Ornella De Felice, celebrity chef from Top Chef Italy and head chef at the restaurant Coromandel. Youre 36, and had everything but suddenly youre starting afresh! But I have no complaints. I loved that experience so much! I have an excellent family in Rome  I can get a couch there anytime I go! she laughs.According to her, fine dining is not necessarily cooking with truffles and caviar or decorating with a beetroot or carrot rose, but is all about techniques and simple ingredients that are seasonal and local, which she says is healthier and tastier. You get fresh stuff from local vegetable vendors she advises. Though she is trained in Italian, Mediterranean and Spanish cuisines, she calls herself an ingredient based cook. Even for this pop-up, we are using local ingredients like baby potatoes, fresh tomatoes  the menu also has a kulfi and rasmalai inspired pannacotta!. Each plate is designed to have flavours from different cuisines  a deconstructed salad has French, Chinese and Italian elements. Anuroopa is excited to be back in Chennai. I did my class 8 here, and lived in Adyar opposite the Adyar Bakery! she laughs. She has fond memories of eating at the Chola Sheraton, Mysorepak and murukkus from Grand Sweets.I love Chettinad food...I dont know why the world doesnt know about it yet. Indian food is not just butter chicken, you know! Does she dream of owning a restaurant? Of course, eventually. Right now I want to learn from the best, she concedes, adding that she is looking forward to doing more pop-ups around the country, while working in the best kitchens across the world. Later next month, I will be interning at one of the worlds Top 10 restaurants. People would die to get an opportunity there! People exit the kitchen at my age, and here I am entering one of the best in the world! she laughs."

This graduate of National Institute of Fashion Technology moved to Bengaluru after marriage and worked as a brand consultant for some of the top companies.Urban life, family responsibilities, job and the culture of small apartments made it impossible for her to employ her gardening skills effectively and, as a result, she could grow only a few herbs in her balcony.Forty four-year-old Anamika had always dreamt of having her own garden, where she could grow varieties of fruits and vegetables too along with her herbs. Then, one day, she was shaken when her daughter told her innocently that she thought fruits and vegetables came from supermarkets.This disconnect motivated Anamika to open a start-up called Village Story, through which she organises experiential farming for children and their families. Her friend offered her an acre of land to run this.Within six months, Anamika succeeded in growing vegetables and herbs such as zucchini, broccoli, edamame, cucumber, lettuce, cherry tomatoes, okra, eggplant, beans, born, rocket leaves, spinach, fenugreek, coriander, mint, carrot, millet, butternut squash, radish and capsicum.Anamika says that her father-in-law, who owns a nursery, farmland and orchard in Dehradun, is her inspiration.She shares about her startup: Almost now 15 to 20 families are part of our Farmville/Kitchen Garden; they are extremely thrilled that they have their own green patch where they can grow their own greens. They love coming here with family and friends. They sow, grow, harvest, taste and share. They feel its an amazing outdoor family activity for them, from where they take home an experience and joy of growing their own food.

An Australian delegation visited the governments centre of excellence at Bassi in Jaipur district recently to study the prospects of introducing the technique in the state.Soon, the Australian government will send a formal proposal for sharing this technique with Rajasthan, after which the work will start, said Prabu Lal Saini, the state agriculture minister.Hydroponics is a method to grow plants without soil, using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent.The three-member delegation, including South Australian governments investment manager (Indian trade) Rahul Ranjan and Australian firm Ironwoods chief consultant Mark Cody, studied the site and infrastructure at the centre for two days beginning January 11.Saini said that hydroponics technique would be used in the farming of tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, cucumber (kheera) and coloured capsicum. The farming of these vegetables will be done in 4,000 square metre area in Bassi. Use of the technique would increase the yields manyfolds, he said.Generally, yield per plant of tomato in three months is around half a kg and when grown in poly house the yield increases to 5-6kg per plant in six months, but through the hydroponics technique, the yield per plant will increase to around 65-70kg per plant in 10 months. Similarly, yield of coloured capsicum and cucumber is around 4kg per plant, which will increase by six times to 24kg per plant, he informed. Such innovations will help in doubling the income of farmers, he added.The crop will be grown vertically to accommodate more plants in the same area, thus increasing the yield. More production of vegetables will help in curbing hike in prices and common man can get quality vegetables at affordable prices, he said.Once it is started at Bassi, hydroponics will be propagated to farmers in the state, he said. Even during these two years of pilot move, an Indian version of hydroponics technique will be developed so that farmers can afford it, he added.The agriculture department has sanctioned 13 crore for the two-year project starting from June this year. Saini said the department has constituted a committee to speed up the project. The project will be supervised by Rajasthan Olive Cultivation Limited (ROCL)."

(Source: Thinkstock images) Representative Image. (Source: Thinkstock images)They say bigger is better, but in the succulent world of cherry tomatoes, one Israeli company is going smaller than ever before. The drop tomato is about the size of a blueberry and the Kedma company in the countrys southern Arava desert says it is the smallest one ever cultivated in Israel, perhaps even in the world, reports news agency AP. Its a point of pride in a country known for its agricultural innovation, where fruits and vegetables are taken seriously and where several strands of the cherry tomato were first invented.The idea is that it is comfortable, said Ariel Kidron, a Kedma grower. You can throw it in a salad, you dont need to cut it. It just explodes in your mouth. The seed, originally developed in Holland, was modified to match the arid growing conditions in southern Israel. Rami Golan, of the Central and Northern Arava Research and Development center, who accompanied the project, said it was definitely the smallest ever to be grown in Israel where tomatoes are incredibly popular.The tiny tomato, smaller than a one shekel Israeli coin, is offered in red and yellow varieties and will be presented to the public at a three-day international agricultural fair in Israel later this month. Early indications are it could be a big hit. Shaul Ben Aderet, a well-known Israeli chef who owns three restaurants, including Tel Avivs Blue Rooster, got some early samples and says the new strand is packed with flavor and will spawn an infinite number of new recipes. He offered it sizzled in a pan, baked into focaccia bread and as a straight-up snack.Its very simple, its clean, its nice, its sexy, he said. In a blind taste test alongside two sweets, he said, they would say the tomato is a candy, thats for sure.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Of the 99 major and medium irrigation projects identified for completion by 2019 through the LTIF, not more than 10 have been completed so far.The year 2017 has been a great one for the BJP, politically. Under the leadership of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, the party has scaled new heights by wresting Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Manipur, retaining Goa and Gujarat, and luring Bihar into its fold. The only minor setback was Punjab, where the Akalis and BJP lost. The party now rules in 19 states, either on its own or as a dominant partner of the NDA. More than two-thirds of Indians live in these states and this is, perhaps, the best opportunity for the Modi government to carry out agriculture reforms in a synchronised manner, at least in these 19 states. Remember, agriculture is a state subject in the Constitution, and this sector has remained somewhat neglected in the reform process since 1991. This is PM Modis moment. If he can reform agriculture, he can not only distinguish the NDAs policies from UPA-type reforms, but also establish himself as a leader of the masses. This will pay handsome dividends in 2019.It is not a secret any more that farmers have suffered during the last three-and-a-half years of the Modi government, first from two successive droughts and then from tumbling agri-prices. In the first four years of the Modi government, agri-GDP is going to register an average annual growth rate of around 2 per cent, which is almost half of what was achieved during the 10 years of UPA rule. So, without lifting its performance, and the incomes of farmers, it will not be feasible to achieve either sabka sath, sabka vikas or doubling farmers incomes by 2022, as has been promised by the prime minister.As one looks back at 2017 with an agri-lens, one finds it a puzzling and painful year for farmers. The monsoon was reasonably good, and so was kharif production. Still, several states saw farmers agitations triggered primarily by very low prices for their produce, be it onions, potatoes, pulses, oilseeds or cotton. The profitability of major kharif crops for major producing states, based on market prices and projected costs estimated by the CACP, has gone down dramatically to less than 5 per cent or negative in kharif 2017 (see graph). This has to be measured against the promise of 50 per cent profit over costs, as mentioned in the BJPs 2014 poll manifesto.The worst, however, happened in Madhya Pradesh, where the farmers agitation became violent and many farmers died in the ensuing police firing. This led to a knee-jerk reaction in policies, from farm loan waivers in many states to a drastic increase in import duties on pulses and edible oils.Earlier, the Union budget for 2017-18 had also announced several measures for farmers. For example, the augmentation of the Long Term Irrigation Fund (LTIF) with NABARD by Rs 20,000 crore taking its total to Rs 40,000 crore; the micro-irrigation fund of Rs 5,000 crore, and the dairy development fund of Rs 8,000 crore, all with NABARD. A model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2017, was also circulated later. But what has been the progress so far? Very little. Of the 99 major and medium irrigation projects identified for completion by 2019 through the LTIF, not more than 10 have been completed so far and that too many without field channels. The micro-irrigation fund has not taken off yet, and the dairy fund was approved just a few days ago. No wonder, with such a lacklustre performance, one cannot expect much improvement in agriculture or farmers incomes.Now, under duress, MP is undergoing a pilot price deficiency payment scheme under which the difference between MSP and modal prices of eight notified commodities is to be paid directly to farmers. The jury is still out on the projects performance but at this stage it is clear that it suppressed market prices further, especially of urad, creating a crisis for urad farmers.In case of trade policy, the government seems to have finally woken up to dovetail it with MSP policy and, accordingly, raised import duties significantly on pulses and edible oils ensuring that the landed prices of these are not below their respective MSPs. Better late than never!What can be done now as one treads into 2018?First, expedite the implementation of major flagship programmes by removing glitches, especially in crop insurance (PMFBY), irrigation (LTIF and micro-irrigation), and the dairy development fund. Second, ensure an effective monitoring and dovetailing of agri-trade and tariff policy with MSP policy through a sub-committee of the Cabinet to take quick decisions. Third, give high priority to agri-marketing reforms to create a seamless movement of agri-produce all over India. Dont hesitate to admit, and correct, the fact that so far e-NAM has not delivered and will not do so unless the basics of agri-marketing from assaying, grading, storage, to dispute settlement are put on track. A major impetus needs to be given to link farmer producer organisations (FPOs) to agri-markets through Operation Veggies TOP (tomatoes, onions and potatoes) on the lines of Operation Flood in milk, linking FPOs to processors and organised retailers, bypassing the mandi system. NABARD has more than 2,000 FPOs and SFAC has created about 700 FPOs. A beginning can be made with them. With experience, this model can be scaled up to other fruit and vegetables.If the Modi government can do this, it can certainly improve farmers economic condition, who in turn will also reward the BJP in 2019. This is good economics and good politics, something PM Modi can sense well.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The genesis of the strike was in Puntamba village, in Rahata taluka of Ahmednagar, where villagers had passed a resolution in the Gram Sabha and called for a strike. The strike later gained steam as thousands of farmers from across the state joined it.Various farmers groups from the state, which had played a crucial role in the strike last year, have decided to stay away from the nation-wide farmers strike that is scheduled to start on June 1. The strike has been called by the All India Kisan Sabha. Shivkumar Sharma, convenor of the Sabha, has asked farmers to ensure that supply of milk and fresh produce to 40 major cities are disrupted as that, he said, will force the government to accept their demands.The farmers demands include proper implementation of the M S Swaminathan Committees recommendations as well as a complete loan waiver.However, days before the strike, farmers groups from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune have declared that they will not participate in the strike. Deepak Bhise, president of the Junnar District Tomato Growers Association, said such strikes cause even more financial losses to farmers. Last year, farmers had incurred heavy losses due to the strike, which was sabotaged by some so-called leaders we do not wish to repeat our losses, he said.ALSO READ | High procurement of crop means little to farmers: Yogendra YadavMost farmers in Maharashtra were waiting for the monsoon to begin their sowing operations, said Bhise.Hansraj Wadghule, a leader of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana from Nashik, said they will not participate in the strike. More than 3,000 cases were filed against farmers last year and they are yet to be withdrawn. We do not wish to involve farmers in this years strike, he said.During Shetkari Sampa, the seven-day strike last year, farmers had stopped supplying milk and vegetables to urban markets. However, within a day of the strike, a section of farmer leaders had tried to call it off after late-night talks with the government. Farmers from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune refused to call it off and eventually, the government agreed to the demands of the farmers and announced a Rs 30,000-crore loan waiver.The genesis of the strike was in Puntamba village, in Rahata taluka of Ahmednagar, where villagers had passed a resolution in the Gram Sabha and called for a strike.

This price is recovered from the farmers.As fuel prices rise by the day, experts have hinted that a similar upward trend is likely to be seen in the prices of everyday essentials. Prices of vegetables, which have remained steady throughout the summer, might see a 20-25 per cent rise if fuel price rise continues.At Pune and Pimpris wholesale markets, most of the vegetables have remained between the price range of Rs 10 and 40 per kg. A glut in production, as a result of almost 10 per cent increase in the area of production across the state, has resulted in the collapse of prices.Vegetables such as green peas, cauliflower, cabbage, carrot, et cetera are mostly trading in the range of Rs 10-15 per kg, which, traders said, is because of healthy arrivals. Tomato, in most wholesale markets, is trading at Rs 5-8 per kg, while in the retail markets the prices are about Rs 10-15 per kg. Onion prices, too, are at an all-time low, as a production glut has tilted the demand-supply ratio. However, as diesel prices are touching an all-time high, traders fear an imminent rise in the prices of vegetables.Vilas Bhujbal, president of the Traders and Commission Agents Association of Punes Gultekdi market, said the transporters have not taken the decision to increase prices as they were hopeful of a quick correction in the prices. However, if the present trend continues, a sharp increase in prices is likely, he said. Transporters act as a conduit between farmers and wholesale markets like Pune, to ferry perishable commodities like vegetables. Normally, these are village-level entrepreneurs who charge farmers per crate or per kg to transport their ware. For a market like Pune, transporters bring produce from neighbouring districts as well as from states like Karnataka, Kerala etc.At present, transport charges range between Rs 10 and 40 per kg, depending on the distance. This price is recovered from the farmers. Bhujbal said if fuel prices continue to rise, the transport charges may increase by 10-15 per cent immediately. This will effect the prices in the wholesale markets and, subsequently, the retail customer will get vegetables at a higher rate, he said. However, many growers said transporters have already effected a rise at their end.Deepak Bhise, president of the Tomato Growers Association of Junnar taluka in Pune district, said wholesale prices have but collapsed. As farmers, we have to use diesel for our tractors, our machines run on diesel. So, this is pinching us hard, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Express Photo By Partha Paul Prices had skyrocketed after July last year as supply was severely hit in the face of low availability of the produce. Express Photo By Partha PaulTomato growers are reeling from heavy losses, hit by low exports and higher produce as the vegetable is cultivated on more areas than before.Tomato exports slumped in 2017-18 with India recording exports worth only Rs 107.21 crore compared to Rs 548.15 crore in 2016-17. Exports to Pakistan and Bangladesh, major destinations for Indian tomatoes, were especially hit. Last year, just about Rs 34 lakh worth of tomatoes were exported to Pakistan compared to Rs 368.45 crore in 2016-17. Exports to Bangladesh last year were just Rs 4.8 crore compared to Rs 66.69 crore in 2016-17.Political tension between India and Pakistan led to the suspension of exports via land to Pakistan last year. Exports to Bangladesh were hit after it increased the import duty on agricultural products to an whopping 48 per cent. In Maharashtra, Junnar taluka and neighbouring areas in Pune district are the major growers of rabi tomato, which feeds the markets from March till August. After that, tomatoes from Niphad, Satana and other areas in Nashik district feed the market and stay till around February.Prices had skyrocketed after July last year as supply was severely hit in the face of low availability of the produce. Farmers in Junnar had stopped using fertilisers and insecticides after March due to lower realisations. The wholesale market at Narayangaon in Junnar and at Pimpalgaon in Nashik are the major tomato markets for rabi and karif crops respectively.This year, Junnar farmers had failed to recover their expenses as till about late May they had to sell the vegetable at Rs 2-3 per kg. Traders had blamed the suspension of trade with Pakistan and Bangladesh for the bloodbath in the wholesale markets. Besides, instead of the customary 30,000 acres of plantation, this year Junnar and its neighbouring area had seen tomato cultivation on over 40,000 acres.The spectre of low prices looms large even as the state stares at another bumper cultivation for the kharif crop.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

They dont enrol their children in schools. They spend their earnings on liquor. Liquor is a bad thing, I have been saying this for 15 years.The minister was away to Jaunpur to attend a wedding when tomatoes and eggs were hurled at his residence on Saturday afternoon.The police rushed to the spot and chased the youths away. However, no FIR was lodged.The minister said: I will take up the matter with the government. This is a case of breach of security in the high-security area. Who knows if they hurl bombs tomorrow? Such a thing has happened where the CM lives close by. A campaign should be run against liquor.Earlier, Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh reacted to Rajbhars comment and tweeted: Why only liquor. A campaign should also be run against Ganja-chillam, taadi (toddy), tobacco, charas, opium, and arrogance as well.Rajbhar has courted controversy earlier with his criticism of the performance of the Yogi Adityanath government in the state.In another controversial comment on drinking, he had said, If someone offers you liquor, consume it but vote as per you discretion."

Instead, they convert it into manure for a terrace garden.The residents of Matoshree Pearl, a 22-storey building with 65 flats, have been treating their collective biodegradable kitchen waste within the society premises using two bio-composter tumblers with a capacity of 10 kg each that produce nutrient-rich manure.The society generates 30kg wet waste per day, and since October 2 last year when they began the project, residents estimate that they have helped the municipal corporation avoid the transport of 6,300kg of kitchen waste to the dumping grounds. That waste has instead been used to produce 800kg of manure.Considering we are not a very large society and we do not fall under the specifications of the waste management rules to treat waste at source, we have still ended up doing it, as our vision is to be a green society and ensure we give something back to nature, said Satish Kini, managing committee member and resident in-charge of various green efforts at the society. In a city like Mumbai, which is facing both air and water pollution, we want to make our society a green haven for our children and senior citizens.Additionally, the society has diverted 2,200 kg of their dry waste since October from going to the landfills by segregating it and recycling. Only biomedical and non-recyclable waste is being collected by the civic body.In August last year, the residents reached out to Are you Reducing, Reusing, Recycling- RUR Greenlife, a social environment organisation, responsible for many similar projects across the city. After a series of workshops by the organisation, the residents began their decentralized and sustainable waste management within two months.Matroshree Pearl is an inspiring model green society, which has active enthusiastic participation by all residents towards care for the environment. It gives us hope for a greener future, said Monisha Narke, founder and CEO, RUR Greenlife.The society adopted a three-bin approach to segregation of biodegradable; dry recyclable and non-recyclable waste by using colour-coded bins and garbage bags to ensure higher level of segregation. The dry waste is further segregated through a seven bin approach into - cardboard, paper, plastic bottles, electronic waste, metal, glass, and tetrapak cartons. Residents sell some of the reusable dry waste to rag pickers and other recyclers for a nominal fee. The revenue generated from dry waste recycling is used to support the kitchen waste management project which making the activity a self-sufficient project, said Kini.November onward, the 4,000sqft terrace of the building was made home to an organic garden where residents grow spinach, cucumber, tomatoes, chili, ladyfinger, fenugreek, lemon grass and many other vegetables. Children from the society have been given a vegetable patch each and they are responsible for nurturing them.We have set up a drip irrigation system which uniformly provides water to each of these plantations, said Shireesh Kedare, resident and professor, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B).This is one society which has made best use of the circular economy model and benefitted the most out of it. More than helping to ease the burden from landfills, this model makes a society self-sufficient. Our focus currently is to inculcate this attitude in more societies, which will give them incentive to adopt waste management at source, said Chandrakant Tambe, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporations solid waste management department."

Of the 125 lakh tonnes of wheat procured in the state during the current season so far, 65 lakh tonnes are being stored in the open.In technical terms, it is called covered at plinths (CAP) storage, which is a great cause of concern for the state government. The wheat stored in open is exposed to the vagaries of weather, and has shorter life. But what makes it worse are the piling up stocks of grains.There are 25 lakh tonnes of wheat of the previous season and officials in the Food Corporation of India (FCI), the central body that runs nationwide public distribution system, say the state will have a backlog of wheat of one full season (at least 125 lakh tonnes), hinting at tougher days ahead for the states food and civil supplies department.Besides, some more wheat of the current season is expected to arrive in the mandis. The state godowns also have 100 lakh tonnes of rice.Must read | Tomato prices crash in Punjab, Haryana due to bulk suppliesState procurement agencies have witnessed the second highest arrival of wheat this year after 2012-13 when 130 lakh tonnes of wheat was procured. Officials of state food agencies said such a pile-up in the CAP storage was not witnessed for the past five years.Another worrying factor is the fall in the monthly movement of foodgrains (wheat and rice) from the state, from an average of 18 lakh tonnes in the previous year (2016-17) to 15 lakh tonnes in the (2017-18) current year.Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are no longer consumer states and they have become self-sufficient in foodgrains. Also, Madhya Pradesh is now contributing to the national pool, said an FCI official, on the condition of anonymity.Besides, Haryana is expected to contribute additional 10 lakh tonned of foodgrains into national kitty this year (a total of 85 lakh tonnes as against 75 lakh tonnes in the previous year), which will cut down the demand for Punjab wheat, he added.Punjab has a covered storage space (godowns) capacity of 152 lakh tonnes for both rice and wheat, and 4.75 lakh tonne capacity in steel silos for wheat storage. This entire space is already full, according to officials.We are prevailing upon the FCI to make movement of foodgrains faster. If the quality of grains gets affected due to CAP storage, Punjab will be at a loss, said state principal secretary, food and civil supplies, KAP Sinha.The FCI official suggested that the state could easily store 30 lakh tonnes of freshly procured wheat in CAP storage to save covered storage space, as it would cut infrastructure cost to one-third.30 lakh tonnes of wheat kept from April to September in CAP storage would move out easily, he said."

Im talking about the intricate web of lanes running from the square opposite the Venetian Gothic-styled David Sassoon library behind Rampart Row all the way to Flora Fountain on one end and Horniman Circle at the other.For what its worth, Kala Ghoda was always a hub for culture and art. Flanked by a museum, many art galleries, a foreign cultural mission, a historical synagogue and erstwhile home to two of Mumbais iconic restaurants. Samovar, tucked inside the Jehangir art gallery, and Wayside Inn, wrapped around the corner next to Rhythm House.Wayside Inn was epochal because it was at Table No 4 that Babasaheb Ambedkar, over hours of passionate persuasions and pots of tea, drafted the Indian Constitution. Its here that struggling progressive artists Husain, Ara and Gaitonde scrounged for toast and eggs, and poets like Arun Kolatkar wrote verses about life, jam and bread. Here that Mohammed Ali Jinnah romanced his Parsi girlfriend over dhansak, and Behram Contractor created his memorable humour column alongside sunny-side-up eggs and bacon. And where a whole generation of post-Independence socialists and intellectuals was bred, over custard and bread pudding.Rampart Row used to be a street full of happening restaurants. All the fun is now inside the lanes. (HT File Photo)I used to love sitting there, watching the rain fall and the brown trees go green, over a mug of beer and plate of mixed grill and onions.Rampart Row used to be a street full of happening restaurants. Wayside Inn has given way to Punjab Grill. Khyber looks a bit lost. Copper Chimney has shifted three buildings to the left, and right above it is Boston Butt. But all the fun is now inside the lanes.It all started with Kala Ghoda Caf. From a small sky-lit space that could seat, at the most, six people and offered free wi-fi, its turned into one of the most influential eateries in that precinct. Its cavernous hall and Bombay black wood furniture are reminiscent of a large dining room in an old Mumbai mansion.At The Pantry, ingredients come from artisanal makers all over India. The Quiche Lorraine they do with oodles of cream Gruyere alone is worth the visit. (HT File Photo)The menu is eclectic. Fourteen types of coffee, from macchiato to affogato. Ten kinds of egg, from the Parsi tamota par eedu (eggs on tomato) to omelettes with bacon and feta. There are also three kinds of waffles, two kinds of porridge and muesli. Its an ideal breakfast place. But lunch isnt bad either. You can pick between sandwiches, soups and sali boti, or try the Karnataka black rice risotto with mushrooms.Just off Ropewalk Lane is The Pantry. White, bright and cheerful, they source their ingredients from artisanal makers all over India. Their cheese for example comes from Pondicherry and the Quiche Lorraine they do with oodles of cream Gruyere and ham alone is worth the visit.La Folie is a stylish patisserie. The tiny place looks like a chocolate box itself, with small desserts lined up like little works of art, but its the hot chocolate that takes me there.At Ayub's, the meat is better, the onions fresher, the chutney less watery. To me, its the Michelin star version of Bade Miyan. (HT File Photo)Then theres Nutcracker, a vegetarian place thats cracked the code. Penne, pesto, panini, potato wedges, with peach and ginger iced tea. But the Emmenthal scrambled eggs with truffle oil, and the Mumbai Local sandwich hit the spot for me.A little further away is Plenty. Its not exactly Kala Ghoda, but a short walk towards Horniman Circle. Brick-walled and poignantly coloured, the menu is a mixed bag of all our favourite dishes that remarkably bear an overall demeanour of goodness and health. Even the usually oily, spicy and vinegary Goa sausage, when served alongside a portion of fresh avocado, pickled beetroot and goats cheese on a crisp slice of healthy toast, tastes wonderfully refined here.They have cold bowls and they have hot bowls and the hot bowl I like is the Kerala pepper chicken stew with steamed rice. But my favourite is the pulled pork sandwich  sweet and spicy pork between freshly baked bread. The finale has to be the berry pavlova, meringues in sour berry compote with vanilla cream, lime and pistachio.Watch out for Maska Maarke by Kunal Vijayakar in Hindustan Times, Mumbai, and on hindustantimes.com/mumbai, every Saturday morning.As the office rush recedes and the lanes empty out, as young couples walk hand in hand in the lanes of Kala Ghoda looking for love, and as revelers hunt for a wine, a beer and a song, I am often spotted looking for a hot spicy egg roll, stuffed with boti kebab. Walk past the aqua-coloured Knesset Eliyahoo Synagogue and at the end of VB Gandhi Marg (VB Gandhi is the man who decided that Mumbai cabs should be black and yellow) burns a late night fire. And that fire is from Ayubs.Ayubs the Michelin star version of Bade Miyan. The meat is better, the onions fresher, the chutney less watery and the rolls less soggy. Hot seekh kebab or boti kebab rolls in soft roomali roti, with crunchy onions and chutney. Thats Kala Ghoda for me as well.But the weather right now is too muggy and oppressive to eat hot spicy rolls. Ill wait for the rain to come and wash the streets and trees of Kala Ghoda, because at the moment SoBos Soho stands for So Bloody Hot."

5b13bc499855b76246379fb1,Under pressure,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/under-pressure/article22548146.ece,2018-01-29,,The Hindu,"Amid files, printers and books stands a little pressure cooker. Beside it, theres a bowl of raw chicken. And, in the centre, towering over an induction cooktop set on an office table, stands B Ramakrishnan aka Ramki, who  as always  is in the eye of a storm, and loving it.His enemy du jour is the Instant Pot (IP). A recent story in The New Yorker celebrated Urvashi Pitre, a Dallas-based food blogger, who posted an IP butter chicken recipe, that required 10 minutes of cooking time and got 41,600 shares. The recipe reportedly prompted NRIs to throw out their pressure cookers and replace them with sleeker, programmable IPs.However, in India, Ramki is leading a crusade of his own, encouraging Indians to cook with pressure cookers, using a trademarked technique he calls OPOS (One Pot One Shot.) The community, connected by social media, consists of a Facebook group called OPOS school with more than 13,300 active members and a marginally more relaxed OPOS support group with about 15,500 members.As belligerent as he is bright, Ramki attacked the IP recipe head on, calling on the community to collaborate and create a quicker, easier version with the pressure cooker. They responded with enthusiasm: firing up stoves from Chennai to Dallas. Eleven experiments and four days later, hes cooking up the final six-minute OPOS version in a little office space in Parrys corner, Chennai. He marinates half a kilo of chicken with one spoon each of Kashmiri chilli powder, ginger-garlic paste, dry fenugreek etc. Then, he pours precisely 60 ml of water into a 2-litre pressure cooker, and layers 1/4 cup butter, 1 tsp sugar, chicken and scooped-out tomatoes filled with two tablespoons of almond powder on top. It cooks for six minutes and eight whistles, after which he adds cream and butter.The resulting butter chicken is astonishingly creamy. More importantly, its perfectly cooked. The pressure cooker is faster, greener, lasts a lifetime, costs peanuts to fix and can survive multiple falls, he says, adding wryly, OPOS butter chicken is cooked in the time it takes an instant pot to heat up.An MBA in Marketing and Finance from XLRI in Jamshedpur, Ramki is a restless entrepreneur, constantly on the lookout for the next big idea. More than 10 years ago, he came up with One Page Cookbooks, which broke recipes into building blocks. He started Pizza Republic. But OPOS is clearly his favourite project, even though after eight years of relentless experimentation, he is yet to use it to make money. I feel it would be wrong to keep this information to myself, he says, adding OPOS is constantly shaped by the feedback of thousands of volunteers from over 20 countries.Years ago, the method kicked off so many arguments on a Facebook Food Group that it resulted in Ramki and about 100 other people being kicked out: Much to his delight. I started a group called United By Food, about five years ago. Thats when the experimentation began. We began fine-tuning recipes, burning our way through dishes and blowing up safety valves on a daily basis.One part water becomes 1600 parts of steam when heated. So you need just half a teaspoon of water to cook this, he says, pointing at a cup of beans. If your water dries up, your safety valve might blow. If you put in too much water, theres a build up of steam. The biggest fear is burning, not bursting, he adds, explaining why people should not be afraid of their pressure cookers. It is virtually impossible to blow up. I have been trying to do that for ages. Unsuccessfully!With this system, food is cut and layered according to cooking times and density. Watery veggies at the bottom. Starchy on top so they dont burn. Length doesnt matter: only thickness. Recipes and cooking time are standardised, and newbies are firmly told to stick to the rules. The key is to cook food in its own juices. In the highest possible heat for the lowest possible time.This enables users to put together elaborate meals unbelievably quickly. Six minutes. Thats how long it takes to cook myself lunch. My mother used to take half a day, says Ramki. Of course, there has been the inevitable push back. Chefs and traditionalists tend to be cynical, often resulting in heated online wars. Its hard to have a rational discussion. Either people love me or hate me. A pressure cooker cult? He laughs. I kind of think that is true. It has become a cult. Probably because of my personality...He says his confidence stems from babies. When people started posting that their babies loved OPOS food we knew we were on to something. Baby senses are very acute... Good food is hard-wired into us. He continues, This technique will change food. It will become the only way people cook. It will change every cuisine. Every cookbook.Overly quixotic? Not if you listen to his legion of admirers, who address him as Chef or Sir, and breathlessly follow his every update. Many are housewives once forced to spend hours in the kitchen to please picky in-laws, husbands and children. They talk of OPOS changing their lives by unchaining them from the stove.As for the tough moderators and inflexible rules? OPOS comes with a built-in punishment, Ramki chuckles. The more you veer away from the recipe, the more scrubbing there will be in the end.Deadly much?People used to be afraid to eat tomatoes, thinking them poisonous due to their relation to the belladonna or (deadly nightshade) plant."

I grew up in small-town India and my mother is a gardening enthusiast. So, weve always had gardens, she says.When she set up her own house, she decided to carry forward that gardening tradition, starting with a few pots on the balcony and soon expanding. The pleasure of growing plants is tremendous, she says, admitting that working in her garden gives her a sense of well-being and happiness.She isnt the only one. A 2016 meta-analysis of research conducted by the NCBI concludes that there is, robust evidence for the positive effects of gardening, and that it can, improve physical, psychological, and social health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US, adds that, Gardening can be a great way to enjoy the outdoors, get physical activity, beautify the community, and grow nutritious fruits and vegetables. This is what our team of experts has to say.Plants relax a person, says Kolkata-based psychologist, Mansi Poddar.Which is why, perhaps, there is a specific treatment programme called eco-therapy, that aims to improve mental and physical well-being through a range of outdoor activities, including gardening. It gives people who are depressed a sense of purpose and meaning, says Poddar, pointing out that since it is an activity with an outcome, it makes people feel a sense of achievement and improves their self-esteem. It can also be a great outlet for negative emotions, improves attention and focus, calms an overactive nervous system and helps people who find contact with the world difficult, establish safer and gentler transition into the world, says Poddar.It is also great at relationship building and emotional intelligence. Gardening taps into the part of us that nurtures. And having that sense of warmth and comfort reduces stress, says Poddar. By becoming a community activity that fosters a sense of belonging, it becomes especially useful for older people who often struggle with loneliness. However, it is equally beneficial for children, since it encourages a sense of responsibility and inculcates environmental consciousness. Also, it is also a spiritual activity. I see many people using gardening as a metaphor for life.Gardening helps you stay limber. says Gurugram-based functional fitness and rehab specialist, Vani Pahwa.Its especially important as you age and develop conditions like arthritis and muscular degradation, she says. A spot of light gardening  think weeding, digging, mulching  can help you perform movements like squatting and balancing, naturally. Of course, this is dependent on other factors, including age, body-weight, gender and intensity, but the fact is, any movement counts, says Pahwa, adding that keeping active is especially important for people who dont train regularly.Even seasoned athletes can benefit, of course, by adding in a few sessions of gardening. Constantly performing at a high intensity is detrimental to health, says Pahwa. More importantly, however, gardening helps you connect to nature. You become part and parcel of a life-cycle that gives you emotional satisfaction. This brings in a separate dimension to health, she says.The quality of food grown at home is always superior, says Delhi-based Lovneet Batra, a sports nutritionist. Better water, home-made compost, no lab-made fertilisers, ensure that food grown at home is more flavourful and nutritious. Besides, the less the food has to travel, the less is its carbon footprint. So what could be better than heading out into your balcony to pick up fresh palak, tomatoes or mint?Batra, who herself grows many of her own vegetables, says that easy access to seeds and superior systems like hydroponics, make it very convenient to grow much of your own produce.There is definitely a shift with more people growing their own food, says Batra, adding that this is especially useful for food eaten raw, like salad or cold-pressed juice.Commercial vegetables and fruits are often full of pesticides or injected with chemicals, she says, pointing out that there have been cases of people falling sick after consuming them."

Now they get quality power for eight hours a day with a capital investment of just Rs. 50,000 per unit thanks to the government subsidy of Rs. 4.50 lakh. They also need not go to their farms in the dead of the night as was the practice earlier, say a group of enterprising farmers from Bobbepalli village, tucked away from the Chennai-Kolkata highway.'There is no marketing problem for these vegetables as they have longer shelf life and better freshness, they say in a conversation with The Hindu .The farmers from the village have tied up with traders in the Koyambedu wholesale market in Chennai to market the hybrid vegetables, including carrot, beetroot and onions, tomato grown with the help of solar-powered pumpsets through a network of micro-irrigation system to grow more crop for every drop of water with water soluble fertilizers.On harvesting, we send the vegetables to Chennai, 350 km away and payments are credited online to our bank account on delivery, says a happy farmer D. Srinivasa Rao as he monitors his 30-acre farm on his CCTV.They sell the vegetables locally when prices are almost the same in the Martur market, from where they are marketed by wholesale traders in different parts of the country, adds another farmer J. Haribabu.D. Anjaneyulu, a product of a Business school in Visakhapatnam, has taken to farming as his profession at a time when his peers shied from agriculture in view of the uncertain returns.The returns are very much encouraging. But one has to toil and also do a smart work as well, says the young farmer who has installed a high-value shade net for ensuring ideal agro-climatic condition for improved productivity. They have also adopted water conservation techniques to retain every drop of rain water, adds yet another farmer J. Bullaiah."

The team members also visited the the tomato fields in Ramasamudram, Madanapalle, Nimmanapalle and Palamaner mandals.Peter Hanson, a U.S.-based lead tomato breeder, who headed the team, was accompanied by Agriculture Market Yard (Madanapalle) chairman Ratakonda Gurappa Naidu, translating the versions of farmers for the team on the field. WVC project coordinator, Srikanth Babu, and Scientific Officer J. Karthik recorded the version of tomato growers.Mr. Hanson said the Madanapalle variety was amazing with high quality. I appeal to the farmers of this region to go in for dual purpose tomato breeds intended for both processing industries and domestic needs. Though there is much demand for the processing varieties in India and abroad, the production levels are not encouraging. The World Vegetable Center will play a crucial role in guiding the farmers here in the direction of raising dual purpose crops. This will be quite economical and also profitable, he said, adding the experiments to this extent were giving encouraging results at the labs set up in the four mandals. Soon, the fruits of labs will reach the lands, Mr. Hanson said.Mr. Gurappa Naidu said the World Vegetable Center had been actively involved in raising dual purpose tomato varieties after thorough research into the soil and climatic conditions of the region. He said it was a welcome sign that the horticulture scientists had noted that the Madanapalle variety with a stamina to withstand temperatures as high as 45 degrees C could be developed and promoted as a premier crop, with global recognition."
5b13c89a9855b762ecebf660,Pencils that sprout,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/pencils-that-sprout/article22487973.ece,2018-01-22,,The Hindu,"Did you know over 2,500 wooden pencils can be created from a single tree? And to produce the 15-20 billion pencils needed every year, four lakh trees are cut. Troubled by these alarming statistics, software engineer Divya Shetty, along with friend, Vishnu Vardhan, launched Plantcil in October 2017.Their biodegradable pencils, made with recycled paper and edible food colours, come in many variants: rainbow, velvet, cartoon, seed, and the latest, fruit pencil, was launched last month. We make pencils without cutting down trees, and use only waste newsprint. We have saved 28 trees in the last three months, says Shetty.If you think their pencils are made abroad or shipped from up north, you will be pleasantly surprised to know they are crafted a lot closer to home. At their manufacturing plant at Avinashi (40 kms from Coimbatore), that employs 100 people, over a tonne of waste paper is brought in every month. We make 6,000 pencils a day. There is zero wastage as whatever waste is generated gets recycled and goes back into the production cycle, says Vardhan.All things organicHailing from an agricultural family in Karnataka, Shetty explains why she quit a career in IT to helm two social enterprises. When I was eight, my grandfather committed suicide due to crop failure. I was affected by this incident and always wanted to do something for our farming community, says the 27-year-old, who was working with Vardhan at an IT firm in Bengaluru two years ago.It was in 2015 that she finally decided to make the switch, and launched Indian Superheroes, a social enterprise aimed at introducing people to organic and zero-waste farming, and the rent-a-farm concept  along with Vardhan.For the first two years, they worked on getting farmers together, and convincing them to make the switch to organic. We brought in 12 NGOs and self-help groups who taught them the benefits of organic farming and how to market their products, says Vardhan. In 2017, they launched an online portal, indianorganic.store: they tied-up with over 800 farmers who could sell their produce directly to consumers.Fruity flavoursDuring her interactions with farmers, Shetty says, she learnt that deforestation is the primary reason we are facing a water crisis today, and how the water-intensive pencil industry plays a huge role in this. Thats when we decided to make sustainable pencils inspired by all things natural, she says. They kick-started Plantcil in a rather innovative way. Rather than source paper from scarp dealers, they started collecting old newspapers from schools in the city and, in turn, provided them with a monthly supply of pencils. We realised that by approaching schools, children are introduced to sustainable living early on, says Vardhan.As the concept of plantable stationery began a few years ago with independent Indian and Chinese brands, Shetty and Vardhan constantly brainstorm for fresh ideas and work closely with their design team. Once provided with a basic sketch for a pencil, the team works on the specific size and shape.The classic pencils have Indian ethnic prints on them and the seed pencils have plant seeds at their non-writing tip. We procure native seeds like chilli, spinach, beans, tomatoes and brinjal directly from farmers. Students can plant the pencil and water it. In a few days, a new plant sprouts to life from it, says Shetty. The rainbow pencils are unique as the shavings are multicoloured and ideal for craft. An attempt at teaching children about the colours and aromas of fruits, their latest range of fruit pencils come in different flavours: pineapple, orange, green apple, cocoa, mixed fruit and pista. We source fruits directly from farmers in the region and the extracts give the pencils their aroma. They are made-to-order as the extraction process takes a week and the extracts cannot be stored for too long, she says.Up nextThey are now working on seed pens, all set to launch shortly. Costing Rs. 7 each, at present the nib and refill is made with plastic, with a cardboard body. They are now researching on how to make it a 100% eco-friendly pen using recycled paper.Plans are also in place to launch an app, Farm Zeal, next month. It is aimed at educating people about organic farming. We will be putting up announcements for workshops and gardening activities for children. There will also be an option for people to rent a portion of land to implement what they learn, says Shetty, who believes there is a growing market for all things organic and is looking at retailing her pencils in Maharashtra, Bengaluru and Chennai.The pencils can also be customised with a companys name, and start at Rs. 6 a piece. Available at Sapna Book House, RS Puram in Coimbatore, Nilgiris supermarket in Puducherry, and online at plantcil.com.Deforestation is the primary reason we are facing a water crisis today, and the water-intensive pencil industry plays a huge role in thi"
5b13ce969855b762ecebf9b3,In Odisha  schools are the dropouts,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/in-odisha-schools-are-the-dropouts/article22476577.ece,2018-01-20,,The Hindu,"Doors closed:In contrast to the government schools in villages, which have been running short of students, many of the residential schools are overcrowded. Shadin Menaka (sitting), a physically challenged tribal student, dropped out after the Sana Raisingh primary school closed down.Biswaranjan RoutBiswaranjan RoutIts a little past four in the afternoon, the time when schools ring their closing bells in the Hatsesikhal cluster of Odishas tribal-dominated Rayagada district. Just before Sekhal Primary School comes into view, a couple of students in blue uniforms cycle past on the concrete road that cuts through palm tree cultivations and paddy fields.Along the highway that connects the area to the district headquarters 15 km away are rows and rows of eucalyptus trees that feed JK Paper Mills manufacturing unit in the district.This particular school has been running since 1926. In 1987, it became a 40-seat residential school. As we enter the premises, students are busy sweeping the yard and classrooms. Some are watering the grounds with mugs filled from a large drum placed near a row of dysfunctional toilets.Hobsons choiceAt 81, the number of enrolled children is double the sanctioned strength. All the students in its hostel belong to the villages located in the four or five Gram Panchayats in the area. The schools apparent popularity is not due to its exceptional facilities. For most students, the fact that there are three teachers in this school, and they get three meals a day, makes up for the visible lack of infrastructure: three overcrowded classrooms for five classes, no dining hall or toilets, and a small row of damaged and abandoned rooms gaping at them dismally. But how could they possibly complain? The alternative  to stay on in their village schools  is far worse, and in any case about to disappear.Hostel superintendent Rabindra Kumar Majhi allows two Class 4 students, Santha Mandagi and Siddhanta Melaka, to accompany us to Ranaguda village, which is just a few kilometres away but not easy to access because of the Nagavali, one of southern Odishas major rivers that originates in Kalahandi district and flows into neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.As we wade gingerly across to the other bank, we realise we would be lost without the boys. Ranaguda is a 35-household Kondh tribe hamlet a couple of kilometres from the river. It has a primary school, but one with just two students. The teachers recently informed the villagers that the school will be closed down due to poor enrolment.RTE betrayedIn 2016-17, as many as 828 government primary and upper primary schools were shut down in Odisha for having less than 10 students each. Its less than a decade since the Indian government displayed some political will to achieve the goal of universal and equitable education by passing the Right to Education Act. But the failure, in practically all the States, of hundreds of government-run neighbourhood schools to even stay open betrays a lack of seriousness in implementing the RTE.In Odisha, the Ranaguda case is hardly the first instance of the State governments inability, and all too often, lack of will, to retain primary students in its neighbourhood schools. In 2014, 195 schools in the State with less than five students were served show-cause notices.In tribal areas like Rayagada and Kandhamal, which also have pockets subject to Maoist influence, the government seems to wilfully favour young children studying in residential schools, cut off from their families. Ostensibly, this is being done to make educational facilities available to those living in remote and conflict-ridden areas. The government even has special programmes to help children who missed out on early education, so that they can be mainstreamed into regular schools. But the fact remains that Ranaguda is 15-20 km away from the district headquarters, and the only reason the children here end up going to residential schools is that the local one doesnt function.This past year, the highest number of free government schools struck off the list, 124, is in the economically backward, though mineral-rich Rayagada district, followed by Kandhamal, which has lost 101 schools.The idea was to merge these erstwhile schools with a primary school located within a kilometres distance or an upper primary school within 3 km. The state would provide transport facilities or an escort if the distance is above the prescribed limit or the terrain difficult. According to Binodini Panda, district project coordinator, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan, another 268 such schools have already been identified for closure in Rayagada, and are awaiting formal approval.Earlier this month, a circular issued by the OPEPA (Odisha Primary Education Programme Authority) to all district project coordinators appeared to provide some relief, as it stated that geographical barriers are valid grounds to consider re-opening schools. But Panda clarifies that so far as re-opening goes, there are no schools under consideration in Rayagada.The Ranaguda villagers, for their part, have appealed to the CRCC (Cluster Resource Centre Coordinator) to reverse the decision. About ten students will be ready to join primary school from the Anganwadi centre next year, they say. But even if the administration agrees, the reason for the low student strength is likely to continue.Gathered together outside one of the pucca houses built under the Indira Awaas Yojana scheme, the parents say that the two teachers hardly ever make the trek here and had last come two days before this reporters visit. Even the Anganwadi worker has been refusing to come here, they say. Complaints to the CRCC have proved futile. In frustration, the residents have been pulling the children out of the village school and sending them away to the nearest hostel schools for adivasi children.The majority of these kids are first generation students. Most of the Kui-speaking women in the village are also non-conversant in Odia, the medium of instruction in the schools. But the will to ensure at least elementary education to their children is high. The basic requirement, which they rightly demand, is the regular presence of teachers.Biju Kolaka is a student of Class 10. He is one of the few older students who continue to live in this village of small farmers, who grow vegetables like tomato, brinjal and chilli. He crosses the river on foot every day to reach school in Jemadeipentho. During the monsoon, when the river swells, it takes Kolaka an hour on bicycle to cross the bridge 10 km away and get to his school. Kolakas elder brother, though, has been sent to study at a residential high school in Rayagada city.The distrust of the education department is palpable. Even though staff strength is low, not in a single government school that we visited were all the appointed teachers present. The teachers in school had their attention divided between students of two or three classes, all sitting together in the same room. Sending students to residential schools is not uncommon here.Increasing cultural alienationThe preference for hostel schools is not from the parents side alone; it is a strategic decision on the part of the State in this fully Scheduled area with a low literacy rate. According to the 2011 Census, the rate of literacy among the Scheduled Tribes (STs) in Odisha was 52.24% against the overall literacy rate of 72.87%.Among the communities living here, dependent mainly on agriculture for their livelihood, the SC & ST Development Department of Odisha states that improving educational facilities through residential institutions has been an identified thrust area.There are different categories of free schools it runs, from high schools to ashram schools for elementary education, sevashrams for primary education, and educational complexes for particularly vulnerable tribal groups. Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya, a central government initiative, focusses on girl students from the SC, ST and OBC groups. Then there are institutions such as the Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences, a private residential school in Bhubaneswar, which claims to provide free education to 27,000 ST children within its 80-acre campus, and has plans to open more such schools in 20 districts of Odisha.Social activists have expressed concerns that this strategy has been increasing a sense of cultural alienation among the students. They are forgetting their family culture and imbibing alien values. A child from a residential school is unable to cope with her village circumstances; he or she looks at it with disdain, has a sense of inferiority, and is always looking for a way out, says Vidhya Das, from the NGO Agragamee that works in 10 districts of Odisha.The current policy is similar to the setting up of residential schools for aboriginal children in Australia and Canada that started in the late 19th century, with assimilation the stated reason. The physical and emotional abuse faced by children removed from their homes, the denial of their cultural heritage and history, their subsequent demands for reparation, as well as the Canadian governments apology for the hardships they faced, are well documented.With the aim of ensuring that tribal children get their education in local schools, Agragamee has provided additional teachers conversant with the Kui language in 18 government primary schools in Rayagada district. They say that this has increased attendance. The education department also runs a similar programme of multilingual education. And yet, the emphasis on residential schools has gained momentum. Anasthesia Kerketa, assistant district education officer, points out that aside from 40 and 100-seat schools, there are now 500-seat ones too.Flourishing private schoolsIn contrast to the government schools in villages, which have been running short of students, many of these residential schools are overcrowded. Gorakhpur High School, an ashram school in Kashipur block of Rayagada, has 1,050 students, of which 220 girls and 473 boys are in residence. The 15 teachers in residence here are well below the mandated student-pupil ratio. We end up admitting so many students due to political pressure, says the headmaster Pitambar Bhoi.Even as the government promotes residential schools, it has been unable to address the main issues that are driving students out of the government schools in their own locality: teacher shortage and teacher motivation.The primary school in Sana Raisingh village in Rayagada block closed a year ago. It used to have a single teacher who would come for just an hour a day, say the villagers. They have already petitioned the collector to reopen the school.When this school closed, the existing students dispersed, some to the closest government school, many to a private school in the neighbourhood. But three physically challenged ST children were left behind. Unable to walk properly, Shadin Menaka, Nimak Raja and Diksha Kolaka dropped out.Opposite the closed school in this 30-household village is a neat row of newly constructed toilets under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan programme. The hamlet includes both Kondh tribals as well as Telugu families belonging to the general category. Some of the latter started sending their children to a private, English-medium convent school in nearby Jimidipeta, which charges annual fees starting from Rs. 3,000. Unlike the nearest government school, the private school sends a vehicle for the children. Theres a bypass road here, with trucks going to Vishakapatnam. So we dont want our children to walk to school. But if the local government school were to reopen, all the students would come back here, says Virata Jagdishwari, who has two daughters studying at the private school.Similar trendsThis is by no means an Odisha story alone. State governments across the country are preparing the ground for the mushrooming of low-cost private schools. According to several media reports, Maharashtra has identified 4,093 schools for closure. Andhra Pradesh, which closed 9,000 schools last year, was one of the first States to experiment with public-private partnership in school education. Rajasthan, which merged as many as 17,000 schools in 2014, will adopt the same policy from the next academic session.Minimum RTE norms are not being achieved in government schools, from maintaining the student-teacher ratio to infrastructure to providing a support system for teachers. With the quality of education dropping, children have been leaving for private schools, says Ambarish Rai, national convenor, RTE Forum.This is clearly the case in the Humma Gram Panchayat area of Odishas Ganjam district, which is also Chief Minister Naveen Patnaiks home turf.In 2013, Ganjam was badly affected by Cyclone Phailin. The cyclone shelters and rehabilitation houses in its rural areas alert one to the fact that this region is prone to natural disasters. The district, which has the highest proportion of SCs living in the state, closed down 70 primary and upper primary schools in 2016-17. District education officer Sanatan Panda says that the migration of skilled workers to Surat and other places has led to the drop in the student enrolment in many blocks. The proliferation of private schools is another reason.In Baunsiapada, a village of Dalit families that make bamboo products, a primary school opened in 2004. The village, situated close to a railway crossing and a busy highway, had to fight hard for it. But the school had a short life. Since 2015, it has been merged with the primary school in Gada Humma. According to the in-charge of the school, Lingaraj Mahankuda, only two of the nine students from Baunsiapada made it to Gada Humma.In 2013, when Mahankuda joined the Gada Humma school, it had 75 students. The number has since shrunk to 42. Educated people who can afford it send their children to private schools, he says. Prafulla Kumar Nayak, who was the president of the school management committee of the now-defunct Baunsiapada school, has enrolled his son at the nearby Sri Sai Saraswati Vidhya Mandir. He considers it a better option for his son.Started only in 2014, this private school presents a stark contrast to the pitiful number of students in the two classrooms at the Gada Humma government school. P. Ravindra Reddy, pradhan acharya of the school, and Suresh Chandra, secretary, put the total number of students at 519, with each paying Rs. 1,200-Rs. 1,800 annually.Run under the aegis of the RSS-backed Bharat Shiksha Vikash Sansthan, the classrooms of this institution turn into hostel rooms at night. Aluminium boxes containing the students belongings are pushed against the walls of the classrooms during the day.The State government has put its hands up, claiming to be overburdened. Of the 11 blocks of Rayagada, only four have block education officers, of whom Kerketa is in charge of two in addition to her duties as assistant director of education. Teachers, too, claim to be overworked.Battle to keep school openMahankuda of the Gada Humma school points out that apart from having to juggle several classes at the same time, they also have to be available for compulsory election duties, do survey work, and supervise mid-day meals and the distribution of iron tablets. Shiksha Sahayaks, or assistant teachers, also mention discriminatory pay scales as a reason for the low motivation level among government teachers.Simanchak Pani, a Shiksha Sahayak at Gabudi primary school in Subalaya panchayat, complains that though he has completed three years at his job, he will be regularised only after another three years. In the meantime, he must make do with Rs. 6,000 per month. How is it possible to remain motivated? he asks.About six months ago, the villagers of Gabudi made a forceful bid to stop the village primary school, which then had seven students, from being closed down. They decided that increasing the student numbers was the only way. Kailash Jena, a farmer, brought his son, Biswajit, back from Saraswati Shishu Mandir, and a few more children living with relatives elsewhere returned to the village. The school now has 11 students, and its future remains precarious unless the numbers increase.Several residents of the village (all of them non-SC/ST) have migrated to work in the Alang shipyards, and to seek employment as skilled workers in the textile and marble industries of Gujarat. As his neighbours laugh, Jena says that family planning has been their downfall so far as school enrolment numbers are concerned. An SC-ST village a kilometre down doesnt have that problem, he jokes, creating traffic jams on their road to school. Clearly, Gabudi village doesnt want its own primary school merged with that one.Minimum RTE norms are not being achieved in government schools, from maintaining the student-teacher ratio to infrastructure to providing a support system for teachers.Ambarish Rai,National convenor, RTE ForumA child from a residential school is unable to cope with their village circumstances, they look at it with disdain, have a sense of inferiority, and are always looking for a way out.Vidhya Das,NGO Agragamee"

A group of die-hard club sandwich lovers was discussing if the dish had disappeared from restaurants. Some even were writing an epitaph to the dish.I dont think the multi-layered sandwich has disappeared, but I do agree that they are not as popular as they used to be. I suppose todays restaurant-goers have a lot else to choose from.But as far as I am concerned, club sandwiches rule. And thats why, when we were sitting out on the terrace of a rooftop restaurant in Kathmandu, with a huge menu placed in front of us, I still opted for a plate of club sandwiches.The restaurant is called Mezze, and it is in a mall on Darbar Marg. It was a pleasantly sunny afternoon when we landed up there. The terrace is picturesque, and you can stand by the railing and see the bustling city. And you can eat your club sandwich as life goes by.The Super-Club Sandwich was rather nice.Perfect stuffingStacks of triangular slices were filled with all the stuff that you need in a sandwich  bacon, chicken, egg, lettuce and tomato. And, of course, you cant have this and not have French fries dipped in ketchup, topped with black pepper.My love affair with club sandwiches began some 40 years ago, when I had my first delicious bite at the Machan, the coffee shop at Taj Mansingh. The coffee shop at the erstwhile Kaniskha Hotel offered good club sandwiches, too.Later, it was my regular fare at Cellars, which became Parlour at some point of time. I have had them at the Calcutta Club in Kolkata, and in sundry little restaurants here and there. When people ask for their chicken stroganoff or roasted lamb in mint sauce or lobster thermidor, I go for the club sandwich. I think what makes it so special is that one bite gives you at once a melange of tastes and flavours  of pork, chicken, egg, veggies, and of course, the nice texture and smack of bread.Mezze offers you a lot more  from pizzas and pasta to pork chops and fried fish. We tried out the fried fish, which was crispy, with a well-browned crumbed shell.Succulent chopsThe pork chops were juicy and nicely fatty, and came with a buttery mound of mashed potatoes. And I could tell by grubby faces of the young pizza lovers that they were happy with their well-topped wedges.A foodie among us asked for the Yaki beef with scallions  which he loved  and someone else had a Panini Caprese  with mozzarella, tomato, basil and capers. And a youngster went back there the next day for some carbonara pasta  with bacon and cheese.We had a very pleasant young man called Bikram serving us  who took all our eccentricities and demands in stride and with a smile. And he told us, rather helpfully, that the restaurant has a branch in New Delhi  the Roadhouse Caf in Greater Kailash.So, I dont think club sandwich lovers need to despair. The dish may not be at the head of the table any more, but it is alive and kicking  and may it continue to do so. And let the tribe of club sandwich lovers increase."

The growth in the industry has started to stagnate since the imposition of the 18% GST and there is urgent need to bring down GST rate to 12%.Biscuits are a common product of consumption from a rickshaw puller to a low-wage labourer in search of hygiene, energy, nutrition at a low cost, B.P.

Over the last few weeks, across India the price of potatoes has fallen sharply after a year of bumper production. With the price of a kilogram of potato dropping as low as under a rupee in certain wholesale markets, many distressed farmers have left their produce to rot on the roads, and in cold storage facilities. Curiously, potato prices were many times higher just months ago amid scarce supply. Last year, the price of other produce like red chilli, tur dal and tomato witnessed a similar trend of steep falls compared to the previous season. The sharp swing in prices has been explained by the Cobweb phenomenon. Farmers tend to increase the production of certain crops in response to their high prices during the previous season, which in turn leads to a supply glut that causes prices to crash. The cycle repeats each passing year, with the lag between price and production causing a huge mismatch between supply and demand. The present fall in potato prices comes against the backdrop of a slowdown in the rural economy. According to advance GDP estimates released by the government last week, farm growth is expected to drop from 4.9% in 2016-17 to 2.1% in 2017-18.Given the humanitarian and political costs of agricultural distress, particularly in a year when many big States go to the polls, local governments could turn towards populism to satisfy their rural voter base. This could come in the form of fiscal measures such as farm loan waivers, a higher minimum support price for farm produce, or some combination of the two. The next Union budget may well be focussed on the rural economy through fiscal measures. Such relief measures that temporarily ease the pain on farmers, however, will fail to make a significant difference to their lives in the long run. Any permanent solution to the problem of agricultural distress will have to deal with the challenge of price fluctuations. The boom-and-bust cycle is the result of a broken supply chain that is over-regulated. In the absence of a robust market for buying and selling forward-looking contracts, farmers are left to fend for themselves against severe fluctuations. In addition, the domination of the wholesale market by cartels prevents farmers from receiving a fair price even when their produce is sold at much higher rates to consumers. The government must resolve to address these structural issues, and not limit itself to ad hoc policy measures in firefighting mode. There is a need to give farmers not just a better, but also more stable, return on their crops."

Some traders, who could not clear the arrivals, preferred to dump them as waste, which eventually was transported to Ariyamangalam dump yard on Wednesday.Traders attribute the slump in prices to heavy arrival of vegetables than the actual demand over the past few weeks. Besides the arrivals from Dindigul, Theni, Pollachi, Oddanchathiram, Kallupatty and Vaiyampatty, the market in Tiruchi continues to get excess loads of tomato from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh apparently due to heavy productivity.The prices of vegetables always rule low during winter season as it is conducive for vegetable cultivation.

Simple and reliant on local ingredients, the dish is a burst of flavours. The shrimp polenta comes on a bed of cornmeal, and gives us a taste of Italian seafood.Our main course is the risotto we cooked, while we find it a tad bit bland, a generous sprinkle of parmesan shavings does the trick. Our dessert, spumone alla grappa with bitter chocolate ice cream and raspberry sorbet is a let-down as it comes without any spumoni or three-layered gelato. The raspberry sorbet has been replaced by orange marmalade, which adds a tang to the bitter chocolate ice cream.In a conversation after the meal, Gattoo, who arrived in the city a day before our meal, says hes excited to visit the local markets. It is very important to cook with ingredients available locally. No point cooking with things got from all over the world, he tells us, explaining that the menu has been made with vegetarian dishes in mind. The beans here are excellent for pasta e fagioli soup and even the edible flowers are great.Breaking some myths, Gattoo laughs, There is no such thing as pink sauce. We have the mama rosa, but even that is not an authentic Italian dish. After the Second World War, Italy was a poor nation, and many chefs moved out for work. That is when the fusion started. Think pizza with pineapple! Today, you can put anything on a pizza. But food to me is nostalgia, the power of memory, he signs off, recommending his special dish of padava chicken from his hometown.

Kote and surrounding places, said Ramesh, a wholesale dealer. But with excess cultivation this year, the price of the crop has remained low for over a month, he added.For farmers, the cost of cultivating tomato on an acre of land is reckoned to be around Rs. 1 lakh, which includes daily wages of nearly Rs. 400 per head. Cultivators can hope to reap a net profit only if the market price is fixed at around Rs. 10 a kg. Otherwise, it will be a loss, said Mr. Ramesh, who however said that the situation was unlikely to improve for at least another month.The APMC yard in Mysuru receives 20-30 tonnes of tomatoes, the bulk of which is transported to Kerala. The hybrid variety of the produce comes from Hassan and Mandya while the demand from the local market is met with what is cultivated around the region.While seasonal variation in production and price fluctuation is the norm when it comes to agricultural produce, tomato farmers tend to be the worst affected as prices remain low for long as supply mostly outstrips the demand, according to wholesaler dealers at the APMC yard. This only benefits procurement agents and dealers.A few local farmers like Atiahalli Devaraja pointed out that prices pick up when the demand for tomatoes is fuelled by food-processing units involved in the manufacture of jams, pickles and the like. But in case there is a lull in demand or the units outsource the crop for a better rate from other places, then the local farmers are affected, and more so in the absence of refrigeration and storage facilities, he said."

A recent survey conducted by mobile health and fitness platform, HealthifyMe, confirmed as much, with the average consumption of fruit and vegetables decidedly less than the recommended five. Patna at 1.63 servings ate the most fruit, while Nagpur at 1.2 servings ate the least. Keralas reputation as a meat-centred population may not be unfounded, with both Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi eating only 1.45 servings and 1.57 servings of vegetables a day. The most recent National Family Health Survey, released by the Ministry of Health in 2016, confirms as much, with less than half (47%) of Indian women, consuming green, leafy vegetables on a regular basis.Your body needs both macronutrients and micronutrients to function effectively, says Bengaluru-based clinical nutritionist, Dr Anju Sood. Macronutrients, which, as the name suggests, are substances needed in large quantities, give your body energy to perform its essential functions and help the body grow and repair itself. Fats, carbohydrates and protein fall under this category. Then you have the micronutrients, substances that are important, but are needed in far less amounts. But they are needed for overall wellness, as they aid in metabolism regulation, enzyme and hormone production, enhance bone density and perform a whole lot of other tasks. These include your vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals. Eating plenty of fibre-rich fruits and vegetables is a great way to get in your micros, agrees Dr Sood. And, lets be honest, they do look pretty on your plate too. So, eat the rainbow, as they say. And heres how (and why) you do it.Red loveRed fruits and vegetables like watermelon and tomatoes are very rich in lycopene, a very powerful antioxidant, says Dr Sood. Since antioxidants help combat the effect of free radicals that cause cellular damage, they are believed to help prevent heart disease, ageing, and cancer. Also, many red foods contain beta-carotene, the precursor to Vitamin A, a very important fat-soluble vitamin that our body needs, adds Bengaluru-based nutritionist, Shalini Manglani Alwani. Vitamin A supports growth, vision and protects you from diseases, she says.Sunny goodnessThe subtle sweetness of pumpkin, the tang of citrus fruits like oranges, lemons and tangerines, the tropical goodness of jackfruit, papaya, mango or pineapple these dont just taste delicious, but they are extremely good for you. Yellow and orange fruits are again very rich in beta-carotene, says Dr Sood. That is why we tell children to eat a lot of carrots, she says. Citrus fruits, additionally, are powerhouses of vitamin C, which helps in collagen formation and aids natural healing, says Alwani. Gorgeous skin anyone? Eat lots of yellow.Supergreens are hereWonder why green juices and smoothies have been doing the rounds? We really dont get enough of them though. We should, says Alwani. It is rich in a variety of mircros, including, Vitamin A, beta-carotene, vitamin K and E, folic acid, vitamin C, calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and iron, she says.From bone and teeth health to aiding brain function, oxygen transportation and enzyme catalysis, greens are great for you. The green colour comes in because of chlorophyll, which has a strong antioxidant and anticancer effect, adds Dr Sood. So yes, your grandmother was right about the keerai.Purple powerBlueberries, eggplant, purple raisins and grapes, onions, beetroot and plums get their colour from a blue pigment called anthocyanin, says Dr Sood. Anthocyanin, a powerful antioxidant, has been linked to increased longevity, better brain health and reduces liver damage, among other things. They also contain resveratrol, a flavonoid antioxidant that protects the inner linings of your arteries.Eating plenty of fibre-rich fruits and vegetables is a great way to get in your micros"

But the sale has not picked up, say traders.Lack of cold storage facilities has worsened the issue of price fluctuations, and traders urged the government to set up such facilities in the market.Many vegetables cost around Rs. 10 a kg in the wholesale market as it receives nearly truckloads of produce daily. Tomatoes are priced at a minimum of Rs. 6 per kg. Broad beans was priced the lowest of Rs. 3 per kg in the market until a couple of weeks ago and the cost has climbed to Rs. 10 a kg now. This was the lowest price in the past three to five years, traders said. While cabbages are priced at Rs. 4 per kg, beans and capsicum too cost around Rs. 12.P. Sukumar, treasurer, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants Association, said as prices have fallen small farmers may stop cultivation, and this would lead to price fluctuation in the coming months. Moreover, cost of vegetables usually begin to escalate around summer.We may be able to supply vegetable at a stable price if there are cold storage facilities. Surplus produce could also be exported to other countries, he said. The association has also represented to the Chief Minister about establishing cold storage facilities."

In fact, some of my best friends are accountants. But all things considered, youll agree when I say that the world would be a much improved place without accountants.Anthropologists and evolutionary psychologists tell us that the human brain has not evolved to live in a society that includes Form 16. Just imagine if all the worlds accountants were to disappear through a wormhole into a parallel universe from where its impossible to come back. The immediate benefit would be no more income tax, which means no more running around to make last-minute tax-saving investments.Yes, I am aware its that time of the year when many of you, especially the salaried class, are racing to meet the deadline for submitting investment proofs to Accounts. Now that the good times are finally here and youre making tonnes of money, I know you are seeking the best avenues for converting your rapidly growing savings into insanely profitable investments.I am also aware that in the investment declaration form that you submitted last year, you had declared investments of Rs. 30 lakh from your Rs. 10 lakh salary so that they didnt accidentally deduct Rs. 40 lakh as income tax.But relax. Many years ago, I used to work at a personal finance suicide helpline for people who had lost all their savings to bad investments. So I do possess some expertise in money matters. This is an important life skill these days because even though things are going well  the GDP is booming, onions are affordable, and jobs are plentiful so long as youre not snobbish about selling pakodas  a handful of anti-nationals have made it almost impossible to find a safe investment.Real estate is out, unless you want to help debt-stricken developers offload their unsold inventory. Fixed deposits are also out, unless you want to help NPA-afflicted banks with cheap funds. And Im betting you already own half-a-dozen insurance policies whose premiums are killing you softly.So that leaves equities as the only option.

5b1423e49855b7624637d5b8,It’s time to reimagine South Asia,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/its-time-to-reimagine-south-asia/article22938048.ece,2018-03-06,,The Hindu,"A few months ago, Anjum Altaf, former dean of the prestigious Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), wrote an article in the Dawn newspaper, making a strong case for mutually beneficial economic cooperation between Pakistan and India. He also gave a revealing example of how this has become impossible because of blind nationalism in Pakistan.At the time, he wrote, when tomatoes were selling for Rs300 a kilo in Lahore, they were available at Indian Rs40 a kilo in Amritsar a mere 30 miles away. But a visceral Indo-phobia, shared by many of our influentials, stood in the way of consumers benefiting from the lower priced supply. Many Pakistani politicians want nothing to be imported from India, the enemy nation.This kind of blind nationalism is by no means Pakistans monopoly. Those who watch Indian TV channels debating India-Pakistan relations routinely hear similar Pak-phobia. Result: despite being neighbours, India and Pakistan are among the least integrated nations in the world. Because of their unending mutual hostility, South Asia too has become the least integrated region in the world. The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is in a coma. Sadly, the most populous region in the world has also remained home to the largest number of poor people in the world.So near, so farA few striking examples will show how our two countries, which were part of a single seamless socio-economic and cultural entity before 1947, have now completely drifted apart. There are no direct flights between their capitals  New Delhi and Islamabad. The frequency of Delhi-Lahore and Mumbai-Karachi flights have become minimal. The Mumbai-Karachi ferry service (the two port cities, once part of a single province, are closer to each other than either Mumbai and Delhi or Karachi and Islamabad) was stopped after the 1965 war.In this age of information revolution, the number of phone calls between Indian and Pakistani citizens (including calls between close relatives of divided families) is negligible, mostly out of fear of being questioned by their respective security agencies. At less than $3 billion annually, trade with Pakistan accounts for a meagre 0.4% of Indias growing global commerce.Those who are happy with this status quo have set responses. On the Indian side, it will be said that terror and trade cannot go together. The Narendra Modi government has raised the bar higher  terror and talks cannot go together. On the Pakistani side, resolution of the Kashmir issue has become a precondition for any substantial bilateral cooperation.But is the status quo benefiting either country? The answer is obvious, except to those arrogant ultra-nationalists who think India now has a seat on the global high table and hence need not care for Pakistan, and to those narrow-minded Pakistani patriots who think they need not care for India since they now have two protectors  China and the Muslim Ummah.China, of course, has become a new factor influencing Indias negative attitude towards Pakistan, both among policy-makers and the common people. Our Army chief, General Bipin Rawats egregious remark last year about India being ready for a simultaneous two-and-a-half front war with Pakistan and China (the half front being our own alienated people in Kashmir) has helped solidify an impression that our two large neighbours can never be friendly towards India. If Indias foreign and defence policies proceed on this belief, South Asia is surely heading towards a future of intensified hostilities and conflicts. Arms manufacturers and distant destabilisers will profit by this at the cost of common Indians and Pakistanis, who need employment, education, health care and food-and-environmental security. These needs can be met only through regional cooperation, not regional rivalry.China, part of the solutionIn other words, can China become a part of the solution, rather than being perceived as a part of the India-Pakistan problem? A three-way India-China-Pakistan cooperation is not only necessary but indeed possible, and Chinese President Xi Jinpings Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) provides a practical framework for such partnership. Unfortunately, Mr. Modi has allowed himself to be misled by his advisers on the BRI. The governments opposition to the BRI is based, among other things, on the myopic argument that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a flagship project under the BRI, violates Indias sovereignty since it passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).Not only does this argument hold no water but it also undermines Indias long-term development and security interests. First, CPEC does not recognise PoK to be Pakistans sovereign territory. Article VI in the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement clearly states in that after the settlement of the Kashmir dispute between Pakistan and India, the sovereign authority concerned will reopen negotiations with the Government of the Peoples Republic of China.... Second, there is little possibility of India ever getting PoK, or Pakistan ever getting the Indian side of Kashmir, through war or by any other means. Therefore, connectivity, cooperation and economic integration are the only realistic bases for any future India-Pakistan settlement of the Kashmir dispute.Third, and most important, both China and Pakistan have stated that they are open to India joining CPEC. China has also expressed its readiness to rename CPEC suitably to both address Indias concerns and to reflect the projects expanded regional scope. Already, Iran, Afghanistan and several Central Asian republics have agreed to join this ambitious regional connectivity project. Will it help or hurt India if it joins this renamed initiative as an equal partner? Will it not connect Lahore and Amritsar (also Delhi and the rest of India), the two sides of Kashmir (which all Kashmir-based political parties want), Sindh and southern Punjab with Gujarat and Rajasthan, and Karachi with Mumbai?Interdependence vitalA no less seminal benefit for India is that by joining the renamed CPEC, it would gain land access, through Pakistan, to Afghanistan, Iran, Central Asia and western China. And if our leaders show vision, ambition and resolve, the CPEC-plus-India can be linked to the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Corridor, thus creating a grand garland of connectivity and integration for the whole of South Asia. If 1947 divided our subcontinent, here is an opportunity for India, Pakistan and all other countries in the region to come together and rise in shared progress and prosperity.Regrettably, the same short-sighted advisers who have misled Mr. Modi on the BRI and CPEC are selling India the pipe dream of an alternative connectivity project by the Quadrilateral of the U.S., Japan, Australia and India. This is unlikely to take off. Even if it does, its developmental benefits to India will be limited since it will seek to keep China and Pakistan out. We are also told that India does not need the CPEC since it has already partnered with Iran in building the Chabahar port. Indias gains due to Chabahar are modest, and nowhere comparable to those that would accrue by India having a direct land access to Afghanistan through Pakistan, courtesy a renamed CPEC. The latter is also indispensable for the success of two other mega projects that are critical for Indias energy security and accelerated economic growth  the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) and Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipelines.Here is another huge potential gain for South Asia. The proposed connectivity initiative, which would create strong new bonds of regional cooperation and interdependence, could also help resolve three long-standing geopolitical problems in the region, in which countless people have been killed  terrorism, Kashmir and Afghanistan.To realise this vision of a resurgent South Asia, two obstacles will have to be removed blind nationalism and the unfriendly designs of extra-regional powers. As Karl Marx would have said: peoples of South Asia and China, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains; you have a bright new future to win.Sudheendra Kulkarni served in the Prime Ministers Office during Atal Bihari Vajpayees tenure"

Kavita Shah is one of the few faces at the top of the hierarchy at BHU. She is currently the only woman director at the university. She leads the Institute of Environmental and Sustainable Development.EducationKavita started off as a chemistry student at womens college at BHU named Mahila Mahavidyalaya (MMV). Years later, she would set up the first CIL  Central Instrumentation Laboratory here  a deck of necessary scientific instruments. But before she could do this, Kavita had to gather her scientific mettle. She did a Ph.D, also at BHU. Her research question involved a range of biochemical experiments. Following this were post doc stints in Japan and Switzerland. When she returned to India she took up lectureship in NEHU (North East Hill University) in Shillong. As an opportunity propped up, Kavita returned to Varanasi to teach at BHU. She brought her first PhD student with her from Shillong.ResearchKavitas scientific life now spans 24 years. After setting up the CIL in the womens college that is still in use, Kavita moved to the science faculty and then the IESD, of which she is now director. Kavitas scientific focus is on enzymes and how to make use of them. She won the Women Scientist Award 2011 from The Biotech Research Society for developing an enzyme-based sensor of the neurotransmitter dopamine. This sensor can monitor levels of dopamine in neurological patients to help administer proper dose of the drug to patients with Alzheimers/Parkinsons diseases. Kavita had found another novel application of this enzyme. Using nanotechnology, she has created a pollutant biosensor from this enzyme.Dye houses that exist in thousands in the saree-producing Varanasi area are small units using chemicals affluents. They discard the waste water directly in the soil after dying, but this water ultimately comes to their own tap water and drinking water or their agricultural land. It gets accumulated in the water table and then there is no way to remove it. To avoid such contamination we are preparing to give dyers the small instruments (bioreactors) at a very low cost so that the contaminated waste water can be treated. We have a prototype for testing it, she said.Additionally, with her students she is involved in mapping polluting sources of the Ganga including sewage and prolonged use as funeral sites that has led to silting. She also has methods to make transgenic tomatoes, genetic sequences of common root rot and protein models of enzymes that come from rice.The author is a science writer and part of The Life of Science project.

Parthasarathi told The Hindu that the crop colonies concept was being implemented on a pilot basis in Ibrahimpatnam-Manchal-Yacharam cluster in Rangareddy district this agriculture year (2017-18) on 5,000 acres with 2,000 farmers. They were supplied high-quality seedlings of tomato, brinjal and chilli raised in the Centre of Excellence at Jeedimetla here.Besides, the farmers were provided micro irrigation, subsidised seedlings, poly houses, pandals with an expenditure of Rs. 5 crore.Mr. Parthasarathi explained that the concept of crop colonies was basically aimed at ensuring self-sufficiency in agricultural produce, preventing market glut due to excess production of any crop and to make agriculture a remunerative activity based on the soil varieties, existing cropping patterns, consumption and production and providing marketing facility.As part of encouraging crop colonies around Hyderabad, it is also being planned to establish eight new markets along the Outer Ring Road and the Collectors of Rangareddy and Medchal have been requested to allot sites for the purpose so that godowns, including cold storages, could be constructed there.However, the issue of ensuring remunerative or at least support price to the produce in such crop colonies is still expected to be a major challenge to make the concept successful."

While the disease could be controlled with medication, many a time, there was little compliance of the regimen by patients.Over the past decade, the World Glaucoma Association has been conducting a worldwide drive to increase awareness about glaucoma.

Jagan Mohan Reddy on Wednesday lambasted Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, saying that he had hoodwinked all sections of people with false promises during the 2014 elections.He said people were waiting for an opportunity to teach Mr. Naidu a fitting lesson in the next elections.I would bring back Rajanna Rajyam if the YSRCP is voted to power in the 2019 elections with the blessings of people, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy asserted.Addressing a public meeting at the Kalikiri crossroads in Piler Assembly constituency, the native of former Chief Minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy, the Opposition leader said it was ridiculous on the part of Mr. Naidu to claim credit for the irrigation and drinking water projects in the State.Many water projects and schemes had, in fact, been initiated by Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy. Most of them were on the verge of completion with over 80% work done. The TDP government has not been able to complete the remaining work because of corruption, he charged.Referring to the TDPs poll promise of providing jobs for youth, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said that Mr. Naidu had disappointed the youth.He also termed the public distribution system an utter failure, as, except rice, all other items had been withdrawn, leaving the poor and the downtrodden families in the lurch.Referring to the plight of the farmers, Mr. Jagan said he would ensure security for the growers of tomato, cotton, and other commercial crops by creating a corpus fund of Rs. 2,000 crore. He spoke extensively on the partys Navaratnalu promises.Mr. Jagan, during his address, did not refer to the Nallari family as was widely expected.Earlier, Mr. Jagan commenced his padayatra from the Madanapalle constituency limits and entered Chintaparthi, the native of Nagari MLA R.K.

The outgo on MSP and MIS was far higher than the previous governments Rs. 358 crore for 10 years, said Agriculture Minister Somireddi Chandramohan Reddy.The Minister was replying to an issue  MSP and market intervention scheme  raised by MLAs Y.Sambasiva Rao, D. Bala Veeranjaneya Swamy and Arimilli Radhakrishna under rule 344 in Assembly on Friday.The Minister said that the government procured maize, jowar, millets, black gram, green gram, red gram, bengal gram, black jaggery and turmeric under the MSP/MIS. The Central government would not declare the MSP for certain cash crops like turmeric, chillies and also products like black jaggery. On case to case basis, sometimes the Central government would sanction MIS but for fixed quantity. It created a lot of unrest among the farming community and avoidable negative publicity to the government. So, the government introduced price support scheme for red chillies and market intervention activity was taken up for onions and tomatoes to help the farmers, he said.The government had procured 5.44 lakh MT of agricultural commodities like maize, jowar and pulses. In addition, 55.57 lakh MT of paddy was procured from 2012-13 to 2016-17. The total paddy purchased under MSP was 39.54 lakh metric tonnes (LMTs). The paddy shifted for custom milling was 39.42 LMT, he said.Centres clarificationUnion Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, in the Budget 2018-19, stated that all notified crops under Kharif marketing season 2018-19 would be fixed at a minimum of 50% above cost of cultivation. It was later clarified that the cost to be considered for this calculation would be actual paid out cost plus value of family labour. So, the potential rise in MSP for paddy (common) would be 8% while it would be 5% for Grade A. The MSP for paddy had increased by 55% at Rs. 1,550 per quintal in 2017-18, he said.The Central government was fixing a lesser MSP than that suggested by the State government. For the year 2017-18, the State government suggested an MSP of Rs. 2,799 per quintal for paddy. The Centre, however, fixed Rs. 1550 for common variety. While Rs. 3,437 MSP was suggested for Grade A variety, the Centre pegged it at Rs. 1,590. The same was the case with other commodities like jowar, bajra, maize, ragi, and pulses, he added."

And now agricultural scientists have cautioned that these essential ingredients of salad are laced with harmful pesticide residues, which are radioactive in nature. The next time you order salad at a restaurant, make sure that the vegetables are thoroughly washed before they are sliced and served.Some of the kheera samples analysed as part of the all-India network project on pesticide residues by scientists from the city-based Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University contained high dose of dangerous chemical substances. Similar studies conducted earlier in Telangana revealed radioactive pesticide residues on tomato, chilli and cabbage too. Researchers blame indiscriminate use of chemical pesticides and fertilisers for the contamination.Two harmful radioactive substances, flubendiamide and deltamethrin, are present in several vegetable samples including kheera (cucumber), tomato, green chilli and cabbage. These substances are known to cause skin ailments, vomiting, diarrhoea, tremors, irrigation, low blood pressure and shock in case of severe exposure.They are known to create problems in pregnant women.According to experts, certain chemical pesticides and fertilisers contain radioactive substances that continue to stay on vegetables and fruits even after the harvest. The city agricultural scientists found the presence of flubendiamide and deltamethrin, which are radioactive in nature, on kheera. These harmful chemicals enter humans and animals when vegetables or fruits laced with them are consumed.A portion of these chemicals stay in the body and when the quantity reaches a certain level, they begin to show harmful effects, warn experts. Incidentally, flubendiamide and deltamethrin are prohibited in several countries while they are indiscriminately used in agricultural and horticultural fields in Telangana and other parts of the country.The results of the study were published in the latest issue of the scientific journal, Food Additives and Contaminants. The samples of kheera (cucumis sativus) were collected from Telangana and other states. They were analysed for persistence, dissipation and risk assessment of flubendiamide and deltamethrin. These chemicals are sprayed to control insects. Ironically, the chemicals act on the nervous system of insects. They are detrimental to humans too.The team noticed residues of flubendiamide and deltamethrin on kheera (cucumber) resulting from applications of a combination formulation (flubendiamide 90% and deltamethrin 60%). It also studied how long the residue would last on the vegetables when farmers use recommended dose and extra dose of pesticides.Based on the research study, the city farm scientists suggested a maximum residue level of 3 mg per kg of vegetable in case of flubendiamide and 1.5 mg per kg for deltamethrin.However, when compared with the maximum residue level allowed for these substances in developed countries, including European Union (0.2 mg per kg), the recommended dose for vegetables in Telangana is several times higher."

Krishnapriya, who grew up in Veda Nilayam in Poes Garden and lived there until her marriage in 2000.Sources privy to Ms. Krishnapriyas deposition made on January 2 before the Justice Arumughaswamy Commission of Inquiry, where she was summoned, said she claimed that Sasikala had thought of taking Jayalalithaa abroad for better treatment sometime in October 2016 when she was in Apollo Hospitals. But the proposal was turned down by Jayalalithaa.On September 23, 2016, at the hospital, her mother Ilavarasi reportedly told her that Jayalalithaa had gained consciousness in the morning and wanted to know where she was.On being told that she was in a hospital, the then Chief Minister smiled and remarked to a doctor that they would not have been able to bring her to the hospital had she been conscious at the time of shifting.Visitor to ICUStating that no one, except Sasikala, was allowed to meet Jayalalithaa when she was in the Intensive Care Unit, Ms. Krishnapriya said she, her mother and her aunt stayed together on the third floor of the hospital and Sasikala alone used to go to the ICU whenever she was called for.While in hospital, Jayalalithaa ate idlis, pongal and tomato rice in small quantities and even had ice cream.She likes fruits Once she ate grapes and began coughing, Ms. Krishnapriya had told the Commission. [Forest Minister Dindigul C. Sreenivasan had last year apologised publicly claiming he and others had lied that Jayalalithaa ate idli in hospital.]According to her, on December 4, 2016, a day before she died, doctors said that Jayalalithaas brain was functional but the heart could not be resuscitated despite putting her on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). When I reached the hospital, a surgery was underway by cutting open her chest right in the ward. Thereafter, the procedure was continued after shifting her to an operation theatre, she added.Medical miracleShe claimed that her aunt Sasikala expected a medical miracle to happen anytime. Therefore, she asked the doctors to continue to keep Jayalalithaa on life support and provide treatment as usual.The deponent had told the Commission that she was not aware whether Jayalalithaas brain was functional when the life support was withdrawn on December 5, 2016.ECMO was discontinued beyond the evening hours of December 5, 2016. One of her saris was brought from home and it was draped around the body before we took it home. The body was then laid in the drawing room of the house and rituals were performed with the assistance of a priest Around seven women assisted in the process, her statement read.No one except Sasikala was allowed to meet Jayalalithaa when she was in the Intensive Care Unit"

Field workers of DHAN had been encouraging low-income households to raise gardens of their own so that they could prepare nutritious food. Many are under the assumption that gardening is a pastime of the elite. Even those who are interested in raising a terrace garden are apprehensive of the initial investment and poor yield. We ask such people to raise spinach. They germinate quickly and help in controlling anaemia, a major problem for adolescent girls in Madurai. The encouraging results keep them going, said Lokesh Sinram, Environment Engineer at DHAN Foundation.One can use goat and cow manure, procure good quality soil instead of using hybrid seeds and urea. The substitutes work effectively and provide healthier vegetables, he said.Presently 115 families are involved in rooftop gardening. The effort has seen several enthusiastic women and children investing time and effort into raising the plants. The fear of nutrient-deficient food is urging people to go the organic way and plant a variety of seeds with enough yield for a nuclear family.K. Tamilarasi and her family started their rooftop garden last year. They have raised a variety of plants, including chilli, cabbage, spinach, radish and tomato, and have seen a good yield. We use our own vegetables in our kitchen. Children do not waste food because they understand the effort that goes into producing it, said K. Karthikeyan, her son.As summer looms ahead, the coir bags help retain moisture and provide a cooling effect during daytime. Gardening even brings peace of mind after a stressful day. It also provides additional income for homemakers, thus providing sustainable growth solutions, Mr. Lokesh said.For more information regarding rooftop gardens, contact the Horticulture Department at 96266 04488 or DHAN Foundation at 90924 04647."
5b147c029855b72e9ad63f1d,Learning from the ‘long march’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/learning-from-the-long-march/article23345442.ece,2018-03-25,,The Hindu,"Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis did the right thing when an army of 40,000 barefoot, largely Adivasi farmers descended on Mumbai earlier this month. The right thing, that is, if the objective was to as quickly as possible remove this disturbing reminder of farm distress from the glare of the media  and future, non-farmer voters. He caved in, extended his previous loan waiver scheme to yet more farmers for an even longer period, and also promised to transfer land to Adivasi farmers as guaranteed by the Forest Rights Act of 2006.Convenient movesIt was, however, exactly the wrong thing to do if the objective was to address the root causes of the farmers problems and prevent such acute distress from building up again. But a loan waiver is easier to promise, and does not upset any of the existing political apple carts. And it is easily marketable as a farmer-friendly gesture by a magnanimous government.Except that it isnt. If anybody knows the issues Indian farmers grapple with, its the father of Indias Green Revolution, M.S. Swaminathan. And he said that loan waivers provide at best temporary relief but actually work against the creation of a reliable farm credit system in the long run. Worse, because of the large sums of money involved in such gestures, money that is required for things farmers actually need and will benefit from, like crop and seed research, soil improvement or pest protection, is eaten up by such futile gestures.In the Union Budget for 2018-19, only 12% of the spend is for investments  the rest was eaten up by subsidies, crop insurance schemes and the like. Worse, most of the direct beneficiaries of farm subsidies are in the organised sector  fertiliser companies, tractor manufacturers and so on. The actual farmer gets to see little of the money.But loan waivers are politically sexy, so every State is trying to outdo the other in such competitive populism, particularly as the general elections draw near. While the fiscal position takes a hit because of such write-offs, most of the money, due to corruption and inefficiencies, does not reach the intended beneficiaries. In Maharashtra, of the Rs. 34,000 crore loan waiver announced in 2017 (prior to the latest announcement), only Rs. 13,580 crore was actually disbursed, according to data given to Maharashtra legislators by the State government,Firstpostreported. And even here, it is anybodys guess as to who actually got the money. A Shiv Sena MLA created a furore in the Maharashtra Assembly by pointing out that he had received Rs. 25,000 from the government under the scheme even though he had neither applied for relief, nor, being a legislator, was actually eligible. To be fair, such mix-ups are not the preserve of any one State. More recently in Tamil Nadu, farmers in Dindigul were up in arms after getting compensation cheques for Rs. 5 and Rs. 10, when the government had promised up to Rs. 26,000 per acre for yield loss in paddy!The same old problems recur with depressing regularity. The Odisha Assembly was disrupted last Friday after Opposition MLAs protested the alleged distress sale of tomatoes in the State. Meanwhile in Karnataka, there is acute distress among both toor dal growers and dal millers. The growers, responding to last years surge in retail dal prices, and the governments response of steeply hiking the minimum support price, had produced a bumper crop. Now, they want the government to buy at the promised price, while refusing to sell to millers at the prevailing market price, which is nearly 50% lower.The government says it is seized of the matter and is working on solutions. At a talkfest in the capital last week, Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog, said, It is finally time we must focus only and only on farmers and farmers distress.Thats all very well, but it is not as if the solutions are not known. What farmers actually need is a robust and reliable credit infrastructure which allows them to access credit when they require it, better infrastructure to prevent yield loss (Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself said in a speech last year that agri products worth Rs. 1 lakh crore are ruined annually due to insufficient infrastructure in the agricultural sector), better market access for their output, access to better information on crop prices and, of course, reliable weather-proofing and yield loss insurance.Political turfBut that will mean upsetting many cosy political fiefdoms. Political parties across the spectrum have prevented the flawed agricultural market yard system from being revamped, because it is the basis for exercising political power and influence in rural areas. MSPs remain on paper, arbitrary and irrational price and import/export curbs in the name of the consumer actually end up hurting both consumers and producers one could go on.Perhaps the real lesson to be learnt from farmers protests like the long march is that pushed long enough and hard enough by the current system, the India farmer will eventually rise up and try to change it  with or without your consent."

The wholesale rate of tomato is around Rs 10/kg and its available at Rs 15-20 in retail market, Choithram Sabjimandi Kalyan Sangh secretary Nikhil Hardiya told TOI.He said that as crops supply is expected to reduce, tomatos rate is likely to go up in next month. Wholesale rate of potato is still below Rs 10/kg as good production of the crop and farmers disinterest to keep it in the cold-storage for longtime are stated to be the reasons behind the low-price.Potato is being sold at Rs 7-8 in Choithram wholesale vegetable market while the retail price hovers around Rs 15/kg, Aaloo Pyaaj Vyapari Sangh, Indore vice-president Vijay Garg told TOI.He said that a few weeks ago, potatos wholesale price had hit a new low of the season as the rate had gone down to Rs 1/kg.Quality of the crop, which was sold around Rs 1/kg, was however not as good as what is available in the market. Most of the potato crop, sold earlier, was deteriorating in the cold-storage and to avoid further loss, the farmers sold it at the minimum rate, Garg said.Wholesale rate of garlic has also witnessed a downtrend in recent past.Excess production of the crop is the main reason behind the reduced rate Garg said. Unlike these crops, the rate of another vital commodity i.e. onion has however witnessed a rise.Few weeks ago, the wholesale rate of onion was around Rs 25/kg while the retail price was between Rs 40-45. The crop is now being sold at Rs 30-35/kg in wholesale market while the retail rate is around Rs 50-60/kg Garg said."

This crisis has raised troubling questions about the harvesting of the personal data of millions, and their use in influencing those two defining political events of 2016.A recent article inScienceanalyses the prevalence of false news and delves into the reasons for its proliferation. The results of the research, which studied 126,000 stories tweeted by approximately three million people more than 4.5 million times between 2006 and 2017, might leave cynics unsurprised: The MIT researchers found that false news spreads farther, faster, deeper, and more widely than true news. Yet what might surprise even cynics is that this difference was not due to bots and automatons, but to the efforts of human tweeters. The persons tweeting false stories typically have fewer followers, follow fewer people, and have been on Twitter for a relatively short time. The study also found that false news diffused to between 100 and 100,000 people routinely, whereas truth only reached up to 1,000 people. Many more people retweeted false news than truth. True news took six times as long as falsehood to reach just 1,500 people. They also found that falsehood was 70% more likely to be retweeted. The key reasons behind this, according to the authors, are the emotions inspired by the two types of news. While they found that false news inspired surprise and disgust, truth caused sadness, anticipation, joy and trust. Evidently, the former set is more powerful. Perhaps not coincidentally, psychological analysis was extensively employed by Cambridge Analytica, the data company that exploited the personal data of social media users to target certain demographics with political messaging designed to influence their voting behaviour.In the same issue,Sciencepublished another study which discusses the role of bots and deliberate amplification of fake news. In an email toThe Hindu, author Fillipo Menczer of Indiana University, clarified, The MIT study focusses on one of these factors, namely the novelty of false news. Other factors include cognitive, social, and algorithmic biases that make people vulnerable to manipulation  engagement-based ranking, limited attention, selective exposure, confirmation bias, echo chambers Mr. Menczer highlighted the supplementary materials section of the MIT work which shows that when the contribution of bots is factored out, the spread of false news is suppressed more than that of true news. Therefore, while humans do have an active role in spreading false news, the role of bots as an amplifying factor cannot be discounted.What these studies suggest is that understanding how and why false news spreads, establishing fact-checking sites and spreading awareness among people not to get taken in by novelty value when retweeting or spreading stories could be the key to reducing the spread of false news."

Agraharam areas. Last year, the local yield was exhausted by this time. This year, we have sufficient crop which will last till April. Once the local supply starts dipping, tomatoes will be sourced from Madanapalle, Kurnool and Bengaluru, says D. Raju, EO of Peda Waltair Rythu Bazaar.Cold storage facilityAlthough consumers are buying large quantities of tomatoes at present, department officials stress on the effective utilisation of cold storage facility to address wastage problem.Though we have two cold storage facilities in Gopalapatnam and MVP Colony Rythu Bazaars with a capacity of five metric tonnes each, most farmers prefer to sell the tomatoes at a nominal cost before they sign off for the day. If they utilise the facility available, it will help them fetch good price for tomotoes, observes T. Linga Murthy, EO of MVP Rythu Bazaar.According to Assistant Director of Horticulture Department K. Sailaja, tomato was grown in 1,085 hectares of area this year against 920 hectares last year. With one-third of farmers using organic farming methods, the tomato yield has gone up considerably, she says. For entrepreneurs who want to invest in the processing units to convert tomatoes into value-added products like jelly, puree, pickles and sauce, the Department of Horticulture is providing 35% credit linked back-ended subsidy which further enables optimum utilisation of the local crop."

5b149ad79855b72ada07d8b4,Why do farmers go marching?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/why-do-farmers-go-marching/article23351136.ece,2018-03-26,,The Hindu,"Why are Indian farmers perpetually in revolt? The question has been raised by many after the recent farmers march to Mumbai and simmering rebellions across the States in recent years.No doubt, agriculture is one segment of the economy on which vote-conscious governments havent skimped on outlays. Over the years, Central governments have allocated ever-rising sums towards procurement, input subsidies and rural employment schemes, while States have periodically announced loan waivers.But that farmer protests have persisted, and even intensified, perhaps shows that many of these schemes arent addressing the right set of problems. The reasons for agricultural distress have changed quite dramatically in recent years.From shortage to plentyA few years ago, farmers seeking to register their protest used to do so beside wilted crops and parched farmlands.But in the last couple of years, farmers from Mandsaur to Salem have given vent to their angst by dumping vast quantities of unsold produce  tomatoes, grapes, onions and milk  on lakebeds and national highways.Historically, agricultural distress in India has been linked to truant monsoons, input shortages and lacklustre yields which frequently put growers on the road to penury.In recent years though, it is surplus output and unremunerative prices that have decimated farm incomes more often.Trends in Indias agricultural output over the last twenty years present an eye-opener to this problem of plenty.For an extended period from 1998-99 to 2009-10, Indias rice output stayed stuck at 85 million tonnes to 95 million tonnes, with drought years such as 2002 and 2004 seeing sharp downward blips.As consumption hovered at 80 to 90 million tonnes in this period, shortages were more frequent than surpluses.But after climbing to 105 million tonnes in 2011-12, Indias rice production has stayed well above the 100 million-tonne mark for the last six years, even scaling110 million tonnes in 2016-17. With offtake still stuck at about 90 million tonnes, theres been persisting excess stock in the market. As a result, in the last five years, wholesale prices of paddy have crept up at a 2.4% annual rate.The wheat story is similar. From a yearly average of about 75 million tonnes in the decade to 2010-11, wheat output leapfrogged to average 94 million tonnes in the last six years. Output, now at 97-98 million tonnes, is now neck-and-neck with domestic demand (about 100 million tonnes) and it may only be a matter of time before it overshoots it. With rising supplies, wholesale wheat prices have inched up at a 2% yearly rate in the last five years.Not too long ago, India was facing a severe shortage of pulses, with output struggling to keep up with the rising protein intake of the masses. But farmers have dramatically ramped up pulses production too. From an annual average of 14 million tonnes in the decade to 2010-11, it has averaged 18 lakh tonnes in the last six years. India harvested a record pulses crop of 23 million tonnes in 2017, matching the official demand estimate, thus dampening once-high market prices for a range of dals. This script of galloping surpluses dampening prices has played out in commercial crops such as sugarcane and tea too.If unremunerative prices have dogged other crops, fruit and vegetable farmers have been up against the high perishability of their produce. In the last fifteen years, India has doubled its potato output, trebled its tomato harvest and managed a fourfold increase in onion output. But poor storage facilities and State laws that keep farmers bound to their local mandis, have exposed farmers to wild swings in prices.Driving the outputIt is noteworthy that agricultural output has held up at relatively high levels in recent years, despite erratic monsoons. This could be because the droughts in 2014 and 2015 have been far less severe than those in 2009 or 2002.In 2014, a drought year, the country still harvested 105 million tonnes of rice, 86 million tonnes of wheat and 17 million tonnes of pulses. Hefty hikes in the Centres Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) have also had a big role to play in farmers ratcheting up output. In the last ten years, the support prices for wheat and paddy have risen 73% and 108% and those on pulses have trebled. In recent years, State governments have also competed furiously with the Centre, announcing bonuses and their own support prices for crops such as onions, tomatoes, potatoes and even green chillies.Illusory profitsIt is early days yet to say if recent improvements in Indias farm output are here to stay. But after responding enthusiastically to signals from MSPs for many years, farmers have lately found the mechanism failing them. Market prices for many crops have tended to plunge and stay below their official MSPs for extended periods.For one, though the Centre announces MSPs for 24 crops, the bulk of its procurement operations (via FCI) are restricted to just two  rice and wheat, with NAFED chipping in on pulses.State-level procurement operations are even more adhoc, lacking both direction and funding. Therefore, while a farmer may plant mustard, grapes or onions in any given year based on the MSP promise, theres really no guarantee that he will get that price when he visits the mandi.Two, even in crops where the Centre or State agencies are active, their market interventions tend to be too selective and sporadic to make any real difference to a majority of farmers. Despite the Centre doubling down on procurement in 2017-18, it will mop up only about a third of Indias rice and wheat output and a tenth of the pulses harvest. So, if good monsoons result in more crops moving into surplus zone, market forces will continue to prevail over MSPs.Three, given that the Centres market interventions on rice and wheat have proved so ineffectual despite large spends, it is unclear how the Centre or copycat States will fund MSPs in a host of other crops.New fixesTo be fair, the NDA has been trying out new policy fixes to address such problems. It is piloting price deficiency payments in place of MSPs to compensate farmers for price-related losses.It plans to replace input subsidies with direct cash transfers. It has kick-started a national electronic market for produce and is nudging States to repeal their APMC Acts, which prevent farmers from selling in markets of their choice.But its aggressive inflation-fighting efforts and on-off trade policies still work to the detriment of farmers. In the last couple of years, despite supply gluts, the Centre has continued with sizeable imports of wheat and pulses at low tariffs.Handling of spikesSeasonal spikes in prices of sugar, atta or rice are often met with export taxes, minimum export prices or even outright export bans.States, on their part, continue to be quite adamant about levying high taxes and hanging on to the draconian mandis, which force farmers to rely heavily on middlemen.This puts the Indian farmer in a Heads I win, tails you lose situation. If market prices of crops hit rock-bottom, the government is helpless to rescue them. But if prices soar, the government prevents them from making hay by clamping down.All this makes it clear why Indian farmers are seething. Its for the same reason that salaried employees are often unhappy. Who would like being rewarded peanuts, after being highly productive?"
5b149bfc9855b72e9ad64eb5,Farmers gain from Israeli agriculture technology,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/farmers-gain-from-israeli-agri-tech/articleshow/62451023.cms,2018-01-11,,The Times Of India,"AHMEDABAD: Kalpesh Patel, a farmer in Prantij , earlier made Rs 4 lakh growing cabbage and cauliflower on his 16 bighas of land. Today, from the same produce on the same land, he earns Rs 15 lakh. The secret to his nearly three-fold rise in income is the new Israeli hi-tech protective cultivation and precision farming method.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu will visit Patel and his facility later this week. Patel is not alone. Some 50,000 farmers like him have reaped the benefits of the Centre of Excellence for Protective Cultivation and Precision Farming on Vegetables. The centre at Vadrad village in Sabarkantha district has played a pivotal role in extension of the Indo-Israel Agriculture Plan (IIAP) to 50,000 farmers in the 30 months since it was set up.The Vadrad centre is one of eight in the state, set up in collaboration with Israel. Jitendra Patel, the deputy director for horticulture, who is in charge of the centre, says that the centre is set to demonstrate the technology to farmers and extend it to them, increasing their income.Jitendra Patel said the Vadrad centre raises pest and disease-free saplings at the nominal price of Re 1 per sapling from farmers seeds and hands back saplings to be transplanted in fields. The Vadrad centre has been developed under IIAP at a cost of Rs 11.47 crore. It is focusing on protected cultivation of vegetables.The project has four high-tech temperature and moisture-controlled polyhouses or nurseries, where seedlings are grown for a fortnight under protection till they reach a certain height. Technologies like drip irrigation, protective cultivation of germinated seedlings and a precise mixture of soil and vermicompost are used, which lead to savings on fertilizer costs further on. The seedlings so produced are of high quality and disease-free.Patel said that because of the centre, farmers also get their crop before the trading season begins and consequently, better prices. With the produce arriving a fortnight before others, the farmer earns twice as much as he would in the middle of the season. The quality of vegetables also improves, with the minimal use of chemicals. He added that the fertilizer costs are cut by 70%.Kalpesh Patel, the farmer from Prantij, says, If we choose conventional sowing, there is a fear of damage to the crop. If we sow seed directly in the field, about 25% do not germinate and this is also a direct loss. In the first month, we have to spray insecticide on three or four times, to save seedling from pests and insects. With the seedling developed at the centre, I save on pesticides. During the monsoon, delayed rains can damage growth and hence if I opt for a 30-day seedling, there is no damage even if the rains are delayed.Ahmedabad: In Kadi and Kalol, it is not only the usual tomato, but now also cabbage and cauliflower which is drawing traders from Delhi. Officials of the horticulture department said around 10 traders would would usually go to Kadi or Kalol, are now camping in Prantij, despatching cabbage and cauliflower consignments to Delhi. Officials said about one truckload of cabbage and cauliflower is sent to Delhi every day. Demand for cauliflower is high in north India and traders coming to Kadi and Kalol are also setting up centres in Prantij.Mamroli Grad Turns Farmer, Taps Israeli Ideas For Huge ProfitsAhmedabad: Samir Patel, a B.Sc. in chemistry, has decided to adopt farming as his full-time profession. On a cue from the Centre of Excellence for protected cultivation and precision farming in Vadrad village, he has set up his own nursery. The turnover of his nursery per annum is around Rs 1.5 crore.Patel, a resident of Mamroli, said he was always interested in farming with the latest technology. When I learnt about the centre, I was the first farmer to utilise its services, he said.I still remember that I gave the seeds of bitter gourd (karela) for seeding and, after I received the benefits, I came to the centre and studied the technology in detail, Samir Patel said.He said that he had 25 bighas of land and had taken another 330 bighas in the area on lease. In the year 2014, his profits after deducting the expenses came to around Rs 20 lakh.After adopting Israeli technology, my income had grown and now I make a net profit of around Rs 60 lakh, Samir said.He further said that he was now into farming of potatoes, bitter gourd, tomato, chillis, brocolli, red cabbage and cauliflower, among others. He further said that he had also entered into contract for potato farming with some big multinationals.Regarding the nursery that had been set up on the lines of the Vadrad centre, he said that he had grown seeds at the government centre at Vadrad and had a turnover of Rs 1.5 crore from this nursery alone.Patel further said that his farming had grown so large in scale that now even his wife Daxa had to assist him in taking care of the nursery."

But this year the winter mist has been severe and has affected several other crops too, says R Moorthy, a farmer from Velliyangadu in Karamadai.Moorthy said he had planted jasmine, tuberose and curry leaves in his field. Tuberose crop used to yield 40kg of flowers, but this winter, it has come down to 10kg on average, he says. Curry leaves production has halved to 5kg per acre, he adds. The leaves of tuberose yellow in winter, reducing the crops productivity and also the tender shoots of curry leaves wither in the mist.Flowers traders said the prices of flowers have skyrocketed in the local markets. KK Ayyappan, treasurer of flower market in the city, said the same season last year jasmine price was Rs 1,000 per kg. This year the inflow has been badly hit. And also Friday being a muhurtham day, the prices have touched Rs 2,400 a kilogram, he says.Ayyappan also said inflow of other flowers including rose, sevvanthi, arali, vaadamalli, kozhikkondai and kakatan malli, which were majorly traded in the market, had fallen. On ordinary days the market sees an inflow of 50 tonnes of flowers in total. In festive season it goes up to 200 tonnes. On Thursday the market got only 10 tonnes of flowers in total, he says.Similarly, vegetables like brinjal, tomato, ladies finger and green chilly have seen a dip in production in winter, say farmers.Winter is a very unfavourable season for these crops, says P Kandasamy, district secretary of farmers association. In winter a fungal disease called adi sambal noi (peronospora) affects production of these crops, he adds. But the prices of these vegetables have not seen a raise as of now, he adds.S Panneerselvam, head of Agro Climate Research Centre, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, said, till the third week of January, there would be mist formation, which would affect the cultivation of certain crops, especially flowers like jasmine.After the third week of January, there would be no mist formation and we could expect the jasmine production to go up, he added."

On Wednesday (March 28), the price stood at Rs. 7.20. However, it jumped to Rs. 12.80 per kg on Thursday. Incidentally, the price has plummeted to Rs. 2 a kg and even below at several markets in southern States.Chairman of the Madanapalle tomato market committee R. Gurappa Naidu said since November, the price had not gone down below Rs. 5, which was a unique thing in the annals of the local market. The peak season would commence with April, with stocks of about 800 tonnes a day reaching the market, as against the current supply of around 200 tonnes, he said.ExportsWe are expecting large-scale exports from April 15, as Madanapalle market will alone remain stable thanks to congenial climate for tomato cultivation in the country. Generally, there will be a high demand for the Madanapalle varieties in the northern States from the start of summer in view of the long shelf life and taste. The demand will continue till July, he said."

Satish KumarAt a time when all things organic is the buzzword, poly-houses are becoming a cause for concern due to high pesticide residues in the produce following indiscriminate use of chemicals.In fact, the sustainability of poly-house cultivation is facing a threat as a sizeable number of them have closed due to soil degradation and attack by nematodes  harmful soil bacteria  and fungi, which have resulted in massive devastation of crops.The Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR) has now come out with a series of technologies and practices to reduce the use of chemicals in poly-house cultivation.The main focus is to turn the high-end poly-house cultivation into a sustainable farm and economic activity, said M.S. Rao, head of IIHRs Division of Entomology and Nematology.This will result in not only production of pesticide-free produce, but it will go a long way in improving the financial health of poly-houses, he said, while indicating that closing down poly-houses would result in a loss of Rs. 900 crore.What has come as a shot in the arm for the IIHR is that a 24-year-old farmer Raju in Doddaballapur taluk near Bengaluru has used this technology showing it is possible to grow broccoli, a crop highly susceptible to various pests and diseases, without pesticides.It is the first time in the country that broccoli has been grown in a chemical-free manner in a poly-house.Of course, the experiment is not completely organic as the farmer has used a certain amount of fertilizers. But, the produce has been selling like hot cakes to exporters at a premium price since it is pesticide-free.Mr. Raju, who migrated to Karnataka from Andhra Pradesh, took up poly-house cultivation on about one acre of land in Doddaballapur, of which broccoli is grown on half an acre.What has enthused scientists is that he has trounced the general perception that chemical-free farming and reduction in fertilizers would lead to drop in yield. The farmers yield has not only increased by about 30% by using the natural plant growth promoters as well as bio-fertilisers and bio-pesticides of IIHR, but the cost of cultivation too has dropped by about 30% as he has not used chemicals and pesticides. He was able to earn about Rs. 4.18 lakh in 90 days.Dr. Rao said the farmer used bio fungicide, bio nematicide, bio bactericide, bio fertilizers, neem and pongamia soaps as well as plant growth promoters developed by the IIHR.It has helped improve soil fertility and reduce soil-borne pathogens.If a farmer uses these chemical-free and cost-effective applications for two to three years, there is no need for soil enrichment for the next five years, he said. Biotechnologist-turned entrepreneur J. Gavaskar, who has taken licences from the IIHR to mass produce and also sell some of its bio technologies, says the awareness among farmers is slowly increasing about such bio applications. Big farmers and some Farmer Producers Organisations from Pune, some cities in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala are trying out these chemical-free applications, he said.Other successesDr. Rao said ICAR-IIHR has demonstrated similar success stories in capsicum, European cucumber, tomato, gerbera, carnations grown under protected conditions in various poly-houses and guava, pomegranate, tomato, okra, brinjal, tuberose grown under open field conditions in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra, and Bengal."

Chicken, beef, mutton, lamb, pork  you name it and we gorge on it. We love meat, says 78-year-old Pamela Rebeiro, as she escorts us down the narrow, cool corridor of her Collin Street house. Pamela, who is an Anglo-Indian, is a fantastic cook, quite known within the community. Even our aloo chops are meat croquettes coated with potato. Aloo just got a bit of lip-service! she laughs.Pamela is among the last few of a vanishing tribe of middle-aged or older women who know the secrets of Anglo-Indian cuisine  one of the most prominent pillars of Kolkatas diverse culinary heritage. In and around Ripon Street, Elliott Road and other Anglo-Indian bastions in central Kolkata, women like Pamela bent over bubbling pots and pans and red-hot ovens as they dished out delicacies like juicy jalfrezi, tangy pepper water, rich ball curry, yellow rice, pantras and more. Lunch after Sunday service was an elaborate affair as the lanes would fill up with the rich aromas as families congregated around the table over food, conversation and maybe some music later in the afternoon. Much of that magic is gone, with flickers of that life and lifestyle surviving in corners like Bow Barracks.There was a time when I used to cook for many, many people. We used to host parties almost every day. My husband, Rubin Rebeiro, was a musician, who used to play at Princes in Grand Hotel. He used to have hundreds of visitors. Ours was a buzzing house. Today, I live alone as my son works in Hyderabad and I dont feel like cooking for myself. However, hes got married and my daughter-in-law will be staying with me; so things may change, says Pamela.People who grew up in and around central Kolkata have a deep connection with the community and its food. There was a mansion in front of my Beniapukur house in which lived four or five Anglo-Indian families. One of them was Mr Jardine, recalls actor-musician-director Anjan Dutt , whos had a strong association with the community since childhood. He had a very beautiful daughter, Alison, and I liked her a lot. I was very young then. They used to make some amazing kofta curry and yellow rice. The smell used to drift to our house and I used to gorge on the food. I dont know if it was because of my tender age, or my strong admiration for Alison, but the mind-blowing flavour of that food is etched in my mind. I have never tasted any other plate of ball curry-yellow rice tastier than that. Now, they are all gone, the director adds.There are not many families left, to start with, says Reethu Sarawgi, a septuagenarian retired teacher of La Martiniere for Girls, Kolkata. The Anglo-Indian community felt isolated after Independence. Almost all my friends left by the early 60s for the UK, Canada and Australia , she adds. Reethu feels her food habits have been influenced by her friends or her hostel life in school. If you went to a school that is under the Church of North India, you would develop a love for Anglo food. I remember the delicious sausage curry and country captain  dry beef curry  made by a dear friend of mine, Yvonne Pinto, who passed away recently. I will never forget that taste, rues Reethu, who is a Malayali by birth but grew up with Anglo-Indian friends, and still savours Anglo food almost every day.But it is not just the exodus, there are other factors to it too, says Anjan. The wine-and-dine culture of Park Street died a sad death due to the heavy entertainment tax. Once my friend, musician Nondon Bagchi, and I held an informal survey and counted around 600 entertainers on Park Street  musicians, cabaret dancers, singers and so on. The whole lot of those people left, and with them, their culture also left, the director adds.However, Anglo-Indian cuisine has never really been part of restaurant business in Kolkata. There are places that serve one or two items like jalfrezi and roast, but eateries dedicated to the cuisine have been a rarity. Traditionally, the authentic food is cooked in almost every Anglo household even today. A family lunch will mean a week-long preparation involving shopping for meat, marinating it with right ingredients, buying dill and other herbs and then finally preparing it, which could go on for a couple of days.While we definitely love other cuisines, we eat Anglo-Indian food almost every day at our house. I had yellow rice and ball curry today, and yesterday mashi (the cook, a lady from Nadia) made pantras. My daughters are equally happy if they have pasta for dinner but our generation is a bit more traditional and we love our food, says Barry OBrien, quizmaster and president-in-chief of The All-India Anglo-Indian Association . We Anglo-Indians take our food very seriously. Families swear by their cook, who used to be called boy, khansama or bowchi (derived from bawarchi). In my childhood, we used to have a fantastic cook, Appana Rao, who was from the Andhra-Odisha border. I remember, we never used to take packed lunch to our school, St Xaviers, as it would get cold. Appana used to cook and the fresh hot lunch in tiffin carriers would be brought to school, recalls Barry.Also, Anglo-Indians have a special inclination for leftover food. Cooking a little extra is our kitchen culture, mainly for two reasons  to cater to sudden, wanted or unwanted, guests, and to relish the dish a day later, says Barry. By far my favourite breakfast over the years has been quarter-boiled eggs, (not half-boiled, not hard-boiled!) mashed with aloo chops from dinner the night before, he adds.A family lunch can mean a week-long preparation and daylong cooking. Our families are closely knit. We still try and meet on every occasion for a large meal. Typical Anglo families still carry on this tradition, says Christine Beaucasin, who works at the Oral School for Deaf Children. Our parties are still incomplete without jalfrezi, vindaloo, pantras, roasts and so on, she adds.But are there shops dedicated to Anglo-Indian groceries? Not really. We use a lot of onions, ginger, garlic, tomato. You can buy them from anywhere, really. For meat and the sausages, we go to New Market or Entally bazar, says Christina Samuel. We usually have an elaborate three course meal  soup, side dishes and desserts. Each day of the Christmas holiday season has been extremely busy for us. We were either invited to someones place for lunch or dinner or some friends or family visited us, says Christina. While the tradition of cooking runs in family, tedious items like ball curry and butt curry are going out of fashion, she says.Is the younger generation a tad reluctant to carry forward the cuisine of the community? While a section of the older generation thinks so, many of the youngsters dont agree. Our food is a family affair. It passes from one generation to the next. I love to cook. I make fantastic steaks. Anglo men are usually good cooks as they love to eat, quips Joshua Samuel, Christinas 32-year-old son.Brandon Claudius, son of hockey player Olympian Leslie Claudius agrees. I dont get time every day due to my erratic work hours but I am also a foodie. Korma, bhuni vindaloo  I love to eat and I love to cook for my family, he says. His wife, Jilian, too, cooks Anglo food almost every day at home. There are many Anglo-Indian snacks including kul kul and rose cookies that we used to make at home before Christmas. Now, we buy them from the market as those are very elaborate, she adds.However, for those who are reluctant to cook, you have home delivery. Ive never enjoyed cooking and Ive never cooked. Ive always sourced my food from reliable home deliveries. And more often than not, I get Anglo food, says Reethu.Veronica Pacheco, a retired service woman, delivers lunch and dinner to around 15 families every day. They are all retired people. I have a dabbawala who delivers the lunch boxes to them. The menu is simple  rice, dal, sabzi and one non-veg item of fish, beef or pork, she tells us. Apart from the retired households, Veronica also delivers to the clubs that serve Anglo-Indian food on special occasions. Usually at Bingo parties, I prepare food for around 150 people. I served everywhere  Dalhousie Institute, Calcutta Rangers Club, Armenian Club and all. I prepare thorough Anglo-Indian food  aloo chops, shami beef tikias, pantras, cutlets, pork roast, tongue roast. My father, Vivian George Thompson was a very good cook and he taught me. When I lost my husband in 2012, I started feeling a bit lonely and so I chose to engage myself like this, says Veronica, who stays alone as her son works in Melbourne.If you havent tasted Anglo-Indian sausages, you are missing out on a slice of life Kolkata has to offer. These hard-core pork sausages are far from the skinny machine-made Frankfurters you get at shopping mall freezers. Anglo-Indian sausages are stuffed with onion, ginger, aromatic herbs and sets of secret spice mixes apart from mince. We make our own masala. From the garam masalas to haldi and coriander  we grind them to make it perfect, says Bablu Khatik who runs Chamans Pork Shop at Park Circus market with his brother Rahul and uncle Sunil. Cooking the sausages also involves a unique process. You dont need to grill or fry them; as they need boiling for at least 40 minutes. Here is a small tip for you.

Some airlines are embracing the idea of healthier flying, offering calorie-conscious menus and new exercise videos.According to Beth McGroarty, research director for The Global Wellness Institute, a non-profit organisation for the wellness industry, even as seats shrink and flights get more crowded, many carriers want air travel to be more bearable (and even enjoyable). They believe wellness is the way to do that. Its part of the larger wellness movement happening in the travel industry, she says.More democraticAnd, unlike the usual trend of ramping up onboard amenities for only their first- and business-class customers and stripping them away for passengers in economy, Ms. McGroarty says that no passengers are left out in this recent wellness push. Wellness in the air, in many instances, is more democratic.All customers on United Airlines and JetBlue have access to the popular digital meditation service Headspace as a part of their in-flight entertainment. JetBlues Headspace content includes videos that address travel topics such as fear of flying and difficulty sleeping upright.Among international carriers, Swiss Air offers Headspace onboard long-haul flights, and British Airways has a Well Being channel on its in-flight entertainment systems that includes meditation and stretching exercises. Hong Kong-based carrier Cathay Pacific recently launched six in-flight videos, called Travel Well With Yoga, in a partnership with Pure Yoga, the popular yoga studio chain. Videos are between five and 20 minutes, and feature yoga and meditation exercises such as hip and back stretches and deep breathing.Passenger surveysAmerican Airlines started prioritising wellness after conducting customer surveys and running focus groups with fliers about what they want. We learned that our passengers care a lot about their well-being, says Nick Richards, the companys director of customer experience.According to Americans research, travellers wanted to sleep more soundly in the skies, and to that end, the airline recently tapped mattress and bedding brand Casper to design pillows, blankets and other products that are supposed to help with a more comfortable sleep. Premium economy passengers receive a lumbar pillow and a soft cotton blanket while the Casper amenities for international first- and business-class passengers include mattress pads, pillows, blankets and pyjamas.Tucking inMental well-being and sleep aside, airlines are also incorporating wellness onboard by offering healthier food and drink options.Turkish Airlines, for instance, has a new Fly Good Feel Good campaign that includes a menu of herbal teas such as one with rooibos, sage and lavender to help relieve stress and promote sleep. Another is an energising blend with mate, mint and ginger. Children are offered a traditional Turkish drink with milk, carob powder and date syrup thats meant to strengthen the bones.In January, TAP Air Portugal tapped five Michelin-starred Portuguese chefs to create low-calorie Portuguese-influenced entrees for its business-class passengers. Those entrees will also be offered to economy passengers starting this summer, says Joel Fragata, head of the airlines in-flight products.Jos Avillez, of the two Michelin-starred Lisbon restaurant Belcanto, crafted a stone bass in tomato and onion stew, along with coriander and basil potatoes for TAPs flyers while Henrique S Pessoa, of the Michelin-starred Alma, also in Lisbon, came up with a lemongrass and ginger chicken curry.A handful of domestic, American carriers, too, are encouraging mindful eating. Dr. Charles Platkin, a nutrition and public health advocate, and the director of the Hunter College NYC Food Policy Center, conducts an annual airline food study where he analyses the economy food of every domestic carrier.NY Times"

The seven-member team, who have been successfully raising quality seedlings in the rain shelter installed at the office compound, now boasts of a strong clientele.We supplied around 2,000 seedlings today and there are times we struggle to keep up with the demand. People come from far off places and often, we have to give seedlings with just the first signs of green, says Thulasi Bhai, one of the members.The Chittumala block panchayat launched the project last year in a bid to avoid chemical-laced vegetables and promote organic farming in every household. Hybrid seeds were procured from College of Agriculture, Vellayani, to ensure 100% germination. All the seven women underwent training at a seed farm where they were taught how to grow seedlings in a scientific manner using organic compost. We provided the infrastructure along with trays and seeds and the seedlings are grown in a mix of coco peat and vermicompost. The saplings are priced Rs. 3 each and we are also planning to open a counter to sell them, says Aji Abraham, womens welfare officer who coordinated the project.Functioning under the guidance of Agricultural Assistant Director T.A. Kalpana, the agro farm offers spinach, eggplant, tomato, okra, green chilly, capsicum and beans seedlings.Along with seedlings, the group members are also growing a vegetable garden in the block panchayat compound.Recently we got around 50kg of green chilly and since it is organic, the product had many takers. Currently, we are in the process of preparing land so that we could grow more vegetables with the onset of rains, says Thulasi. Saniya Aby, Hymavathy Amma, Krishnakumari, Sharada, Jessy and Sindhu are the other members of the Gramasree team."

(File) Mandeep Singh, a vegetable trader at the same market, said the retail consumer is sure to be hit hard. (File)At the largest vegetable market of Jalandhar, Maqsudan mandi, tomato was being sold at Rs 40-70 per crate, which has 20 kgs, as per wholesale price. The same crate on Friday sold for Rs 300 more, almost a five-time high in a day. Similarly, the wholesale price of Shimla Mirch (capsicum) was Rs 50 for 15 kgs on Thursday. On Friday, it was being sold for Rs 225 per 15 kgs, again a five-time hike.A similar hike was seen in the prices of several vegetables because of the 10-day nationwide agitation by farmers that started Friday. During this period, farmers have announced to go on leave and will not supply vegetables and milk in cities. In Punjab, three out of 11 farmers organisations are supporting the stir. One can well imagine what would be the picture in the coming 10 days, said Rohit Sharma, a vegetable trader at Maqsudan.Mandeep Singh, another vegetable trader at the same market, said the retail consumer is sure to be hit hard.A retailer from vegetable market at Partap Bagh area said, Because of the transportation charges in carrying vegetables from wholesale to retail markets, our margins are high.Subhash, who owns a vegetable shop in Mai Hiran Gate area, echoes his view. Meanwhile, several farmers were seen moving on tractors in the city today and stopping others farmers not supporting the agitation from supplying vegetables and milk to city areas. The protesting farmers also created a ruckus at Maqsudan mandi by throwing away vegetables bough by traders from farmers in bulk. We request them not to disturb us as we are not opposing their protest at all, said Prem Singh, a wholesaler at Maqsudan.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

(Express Photo by Sahil Walia) Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar. (Express Photo by Sahil Walia)Opposition Congress and INLD on Sunday launched a scathing attack on the Khattar led BJP government alleging every section was fed up with its misrule.In separate news conferences here, Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda and INLDs Abhay Singh Chautala targeted the state government over a host of issues including those on farmers, employees, youth and players. Hooda said Manohar Lal Khattar governments Bhavantar Bharpayee Yojana, launched to protect the growers in the event of crash in prices, had failed to yield results. He said recently farmers at many places had been forced to throw their tomato crops on roads or give them to the Gaushalas.The government did not come to the rescue of tomato farmers when prices crashed. They have not got any benefit under this Yojana, the former chief minister claimed. On the players issue, he said: The government first cancelled the awards ceremony and afterwards has been coming out with contradictory statements regarding honouring them. They are not clear which policy they have to follow and players are being disrespected. He was also asked about the state government suspending Haryana Staff Selection Commission chairman B B Bharti after a row over an objectionable question pertaining to Brahmins, in an examination conducted by the board.Hooda said there was no provision to suspend HSSC chairman and the government should either dismiss him or ask him to resign. He said, moreover, the state government too should be held equally responsible as it was not a mere mistake in a question paper but an insult to the entire Brahmin community. Hooda also asked the government to immediately resolve the issue of ongoing strike by the sanitation workers. While this government keeps talking so much about Swachh Bharat and Swachh Haryana, it is making no efforts to end the 10-day old strike which has resulted in heaps of garbage being piled up and inconvenienced the citizens he stated.Meanwhile, INLDs senior leader Abhay Singh Chatuala, while addressing another news conference, demanded the Khattar government issue a white paper on the five foreign trips undertaken by the Chief Minister and those part of his entourage on different occasions giving full details. Chautala said that while the government has claimed that investments worth over Rs 7 lakh crore had fructified as a result of MoUs signed with various governments and other agencies during these trips, the white paper should detail how much revenue has actually been garnered out of these investments.Chautala, who is Leader of Opposition in the State Assembly, also said that the Chief Minister had claimed that lot of wasteful expenditure has been incurred as part of hospitality expenses during Hoodas tenure. ..then it is the responsibility of the present government to tell what steps are being taken to reclaim that money, he added. However, while reacting to this, Hooda said, if people come to meet the Chief Minister (during his time), it is his responsibility to offer them a cup of tea and snacks. But everyone knows that nobody comes to meet him (Khattar). If they have their way, the present government would even set up a Commission of Inquiry to go into how much tea and biscuits had been consumed on the hospitality that was extended. On criticism by Hooda to INLD-BSPs ongoing Jail Bharo Andolan on SYL canal issue, and his dubbing it as Bus Bharo Andolan, Chautala said,those coming from five star culture will not understand our agitation.Our leaders and workers have been courting arrest and authorities let us off in the evening saying they do not have any place to keep us in jails. Hooda had said that INLDs Jail Bharo Andolan on SYL was limited to getting on to the buses, courting arrest and getting released in the evening. Had they been serious, they would have actually gone to jail on this issue, Hooda said.On the developments in Karnataka, both Hooda and Chautala said B S Yedurappas resignation had thoroughly exposed the BJP, which allegedly wanted to encourage horse trading despite knowing they did not have numbers on their side to cobble up a majority.Replying to another question, Chautala said Mayawati-led third front will come into existence and the BSP supremo will be the countrys next prime minister after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Representational)When prices skyrocket, essential commodities get treated as luxury items. In India, we have seen that with onions and tomatoes every year. But today, if people were asked whats the most expensive essential commodity in the market, their eyes would turn most likely to fuel stations. A litre of petrol in Kerala today costs Rs 78.61, whereas in cities like Mumbai where its a whopping Rs 81.94 per litre.A unit of the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI), a Left-aligned youth wing, which has never missed an opportunity to criticise the Narendra Modi-led administration in Kasaragod district of Kerala, has now announced a local cricket tournament, the winners of which will receive 1.5 litres of petrol as the prize. The local DYFI leadership has positioned the tournament as a form of protest against the central governments decisions on fuel prices.The tournament is being held in Mudamkulam in Kasaragod district on April 29 as a part of the partys local unit meeting. It will be symbolically inaugurated by an autorickshaw driver, who are the worst-affected by the fuel price hike.Unlike international cricket matches, this tournament will only see teams with six members each playing on a small ground where scoring is limited to one side of the pitch. If a batsman hits the ball to the stone quarry located nearby, he will be deemed out. Leg before wicket is not permissible.

But traders say that in a months time, vegetables may turn dearer.Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra recorded a good yield of vegetables due to copious rainfall last year, said A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam.The produce was harvested simultaneously. Due to the good yield, the prices of many vegetables continue to be low. However, it may begin to increase soon. There may be no new yield due to summer and water shortage. The rising heat level will play a role in price rise. The quality of produce will also be affected, he said. As on Tuesday, a kg of onions from Andhra Pradesh was priced at Rs. 10 to Rs. 12, while onions supplied from Maharashtra were priced at Rs. 12 to Rs. 15 depending on size, variety and quality, he added.Tomatoes were priced at Rs. 8 per kg. In fact, last week, the price ranged from Rs. 5 to 10, he pointed out. Potatoes cost Rs. 20 to Rs. 22, while small onions were priced at Rs. 20 to Rs. 25.The rates of a few vegetables have been on the rise. The cost of beans has increased from Rs. 10-Rs. 15 nearly 15 days ago to Rs. 40 now. Beans and cauliflower are easily perishable during summer. Cauliflower is priced at Rs. 20 to Rs. 30 a piece, he added. Another vegetable that has turned costlier is the local thorny brinjal. Last week, a kg was priced in the range of Rs. 10 to 12. In the last two to three days, the rate has been on the rise and today a kg costs Rs. 40, he added.The prices of other vegetables (per kg) are  carrot Rs. 15, ladys finger Rs. 15 to Rs. 20, drumstick Rs. 15 to Rs. 20, snake gourd Rs. 15, bitter gourd Rs. 25, radish Rs. 10 to Rs. 15, green chillies Rs. 15 to Rs. 20, ginger Rs. 30 to Rs. 40 and coriander Rs. 20 to Rs. 25, according to Mr. Balu."

With the peak summer days round the corner, the cost of several vegetables is slowly on the rise.Traders at the Koyambedu wholesale market noted that the prices of vegetables were steadily increasing since the last week of March. While some vegetables are costlier by up to 40 % compared to last month, most of them are priced at least 20 % more. However, many merchants reported brisk sales due to the festive season.Beans, broad beans and tomatoes are among the costly vegetables this season. While one kg of beans is sold for nearly Rs. 55 depending on the quality, broad beans are priced at Rs. 50 a kg in the wholesale market. These vegetables are sold for Rs. 65-Rs. 70 a kg at the retail market.Some residents like Sivagami B., a resident of Anna Nagar, use green vegetables from their home garden more often to deal with runaway increase in prices.According to wholesale traders at Koyambedu, the citys hub of perishable goods, some staple vegetables such as potato, onion and small onions remain affordable. Drumsticks are among the few seasonal vegetables that are cheaper.P. Sukumar, treasurer, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants Welfare Association, said the prices of vegetables begin to increase in April as yield would be less due to depleting groundwater sources. Even vegetables like chayote (chow chow) that are priced within Rs. 15 a kg are costly as the market did not receive its share from Karnataka. The demand for cucumber and lime has also pushed the prices up this week.The Koyambedu market receives 320 truckloads of produce daily, which is nearly 80 trucks less compared to March.We dont expect a steep hike like last March as there is sporadic rainfall across the State now and also in Karnataka. Vegetables were at least 50% costly than usual during May and June last year, he said."

Mumbaikars will thus have to wait for at least a few months before they can catch a glimpse of them.Dr. Komal Raul, veterinary doctor at the zoos hospital who is supervising their care, said, Among emus, it is the father who incubates the eggs. But he did not do so for the first 25 eggs. We were unsuccessful in incubating them in our facility too. The father incubated only five eggs of which four hatched and one is still in process. The chicks were born on April 7 and moved to the hospital immediately. Parent-birds may not allow constant monitoring of chicks or may neglect them, even trampling upon them. Besides, the chicks are susceptible to infection.In 2016, Byculla Zoo saw thousands of visitors each day coming to see the newly-acquired Humboldt penguins. The penguins are still the star attraction despite the management charging an entry fee. The zoo has always had emu birds, a variety native to Australia. The zoo had two females and one male, and one of these pairs gave birth to a chick around three years ago, followed by the four chicks last month. The parent-birds had laid 30 eggs, of which only these four survived.Emu birds are flightless but are known to be the second largest birds after the ostrich. They can grow up to six feet in height and weigh up to 50 kg.The chicks are doing well and are active, said hospital authorities. They are being fed green salads, bird feed, tomatoes, fruits, boiled eggs and sprouts. Their weight is recorded everyday.Dr. Sanjay Tripathi, Director of Byculla zoo, said, When they will be brought to the enclosure for public viewing is a decision doctors will take. Meanwhile, authorities are hopeful about the fifth egg."
