5a581ffe9855b770e038337c,Over 100 years of whisking away B’lureans,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2018/jan/10/over-100-years-of-whisking-away-blureans-1750276.html,2018-01-11,"BENGALURU: For anyone who has grown up in Bengaluru, before the mushrooming of various bakery chains and outlets, the iconic Iyengar bakeries, found around every street corner, were go-to spots for the softest sponge cakes, fresh buns and crispy puffs. The heady aroma of bread being brought out of the oven would envelop the entire locality, a smell that takes many back to carefree childhood days.Over the years, people have moved on to fancier bakeries, but those loyal to Iyengar bakeries, some of which have crossed the 100-year mark, continue to be customers, sometimes traveling far off to their favourite one, or waking up in the wee hours to get a fresh batch of buns.Bakeries places to socialise in Colonial timesCity-based historian Arun Prasad says that the art of baking dates back to the time of the Roman Empire, and was eventually popularised by the British, who took the art to the countries they colonized. In Colonial times, bakeries were primarily spaces to socialize, he says.British army officers brought cakes and cookies from England to India. Though it is hard to trace the exact history, it is certain that it was the Iyengar community, who learnt baking from the British, that brought bakeries to the city, and these became popular for their high quality, hygeinic food, says Prasad.2)Owner of BB Bakery with fresh vegetable toast3)Oldest Iyengar Bakery in city, BB Bakery, Kengeri4) Sreenivas with his wife at the bakery5)Chocolate chip cookies fresh out of oven at BB BakeryHe says that these Tamil-speaking Iyengars travelled to different parts from the Hassan district  one theory is that they came looking for jobs, the other is that there was a draught that forced them to relocate. This sect of Iyengars are called Hebbar Iyengars, and were followers of Ramanujam. They were also referred to as Ashtangrama Iyengars, owing to the fact that they were from eight different villages within the Hassan district. Though the period of migration is uncertain, it is known that these Iyengars were employed by the British for various jobs  some in administrative posts, others as helpers on private estates, which is how they learnt how to bake. Despite being a vegetarian community, they started using egg for baking purposes.After the 1950s, Iyengar bakeries became popular throughout the city, and the community became known as bakery Iyengars or bread Iyengars. However, several other people, outside the community, opened up these bakeries by banking on the same name, says Prasad.First Iyengar bakery in city estd in 1898Prasad says that there was a theory that the first Iyengar bakery in the city was started in the 1890s by a family from Hassan, and was a sweet shop before it became a bakery.Shedding some light on this is Pavithra, whose father, Sreenivas, runs BB Bakery, apparently the first Iyengar bakery in the city, started in 1898. Pavithra says that her great grandfather Thirumalachar, ran a sweet shop in Chikpet, and was taught how to bake bread by a British man, whose name is unknown. After buns, Thirumalachar started selling bread and cakes too.My father was never inclined towards studies, and despite his fathers hesitance towards him joining the business, he decided to take over, and I plan on carrying on the legacy after him, says Pavithra, adding that the buns are their most popular item till date, as their size and taste make them very unique and sought after.Though BB Bakery moved out of its old home in Chikpet, due to issues with the owner, and has relocated to Kengeri now, Pavithra says that loyal customers, some of whom have been visiting for the last 50 years, still come all the way. She says her father wakes up at 5am everyday, at his age, to ensure his customers get fresh buns. Despite him not being keen on his three daughters taking over, they dont want the over-a-century-old family business to die out.6)Hot and crispy vegetable puffs at BB Bakery7) Famous bun-butter-jam at Iyengar Bakery, Austin Town8)Sreenivas stacking baked goods at BB Bakery9)Freshly baked buns at Iyengars Bakery, Austin Town10) Loaves of bread at Iyengars Bakery, Austin TownWay forwardPavithra says that business has changed over the years. Earlier, people would pick up in bulk, but now, its become on a more day-to-day basis, where people pick up just what they need for that day.My father keeps experimenting and innovating now to keep the products selling. The tomato bun, pudina bun, kaju khara, choco-gems cookies and choco-strawberry cookies are newer items, and they have been doing well. My father just wants to keep his customers satisfied, she says, adding that to keep up with the times, her younger sister has started a Facebook page and rebranded the bakery with a new logo too.Raman and Lakshmeesha, brothers to run Iyengars Bakery in Austin Town, say that their father started the bakery back in 1981. The baked good they are known for are bun-butter-jam, plain cakes and nippat.We sell 250 products, from buns to namkeen to cakes. We have started online orders, and are the only Iyengar bakery that is doing this. But we have noticed that these days, people are picking up goods just for their daily requirements.Nostalgia all the wayFor Ruth Dsouza Prabhu, a food writer, her earliest memories of Iyengar bakeries go back to when she first moved here to work, about 18 years back. I would go to the closest Iyengar bakery before work for breakfast and pick up an aloo bun or a khaara bun, which is filled with a spicy mix of vegetables, and this would keep me satisfied for quite some time. The plain cakes are something I still pick up, and my daughter, who is extremely fussy about her food, tried this one first and that is how she took to eating cake  so I am thankful to Iyengar bakeries for this, she says.Prakash, 63, has lived in Bengaluru almost all his life, and Iyengar bakeries are part of his childhood in the city. As kids, we would go to the bakery and buy cream buns with the little pocket money we got  this was after school when all the neighbourhood boys would get together to play. Even now, some of my friends and I gather here in the evenings, some even bring their grandkids. But we dont eat cream buns anymore, he says laughing.Fakers stay awayOver the years, some people have started Iyengar bakeries without actually belonging to the community, which has resulted in legal issues. Raman says, People who arent from the community are using the name just to make their bakeries popular, they are not authentic. However, those who know which the authentic bakeries are, make sure they go only to the original ones, he says, adding that his only request to customers is to go to authentic Iyengar bakeries, and not take the others at face value."

As the price for the day is announced disappointment is writ large on his face. At Rs80 per crate of 15kg, Tomato is threatening to bring tears in the eyes in this poll season for the farmers in this drought prone district.Good showers last monsoon had brought cheers for the farmers who had suffered consecutive years of drought. ""We can make some profit only if the price of tomato crosses Rs150 per crate and the price today will leave me incurring loss. With more farmers set to bring their produce to the market in the coming days I am really worried about the grim future. The price could fall below Rs50 per crate. It will be a disaster,"" adds Vishwanath Reddy, a tomato grower from Mangasandra village in Kolar.The familiar scene of farmers dumping their tomato produce on the roads as a mark of protest is likely to repeat, says Santosh, a tomato merchant who supplies tomatos from Kolar to not only places like Chennai, Kolkata, Rajasthan and other parts of the country, but even exports to Quatar and Pakistan. ""We are sending over 300 to 400 crates every day now to Quatar and Pakistan,"" claims Santosh.A perennially drought prone district, Kolar has carved a niche for itself in horticulture. The district is the main supplier of Mango and vegetables like tomato, cabbage, cauliflower and beans.We have been let down by our leadersWhile the tomato tale of tears is a recurring feature, the farmers of Kolar curse the failure of their leaders for letting them down in redressing their problem. ""We had agriculture ministers like C Byre Gowda, Srinivasa Gowda and now Krishna Byre Gowda from our own district, but without finding a lasting solution for our woes whether in getting water for our crops or ensuring a fair price and market for our produce,"" says Chandrappa who has branched out to sericulture apart from his tomato farming.Known as the district of 'Silk and Milk' for its strides in sericulture and dairy farming, the people are waking up for the electoral heat with their demands.""Setting up cold storage chains to store farm produce during the time of price crash, setting up agro-processing industries, speeding up projects like Yettinahole and Yarragolu ti bring water, giving push for industrial growth in the region,' tops our wish, says Chandrappa of Mudavadi village.The villages are already seeing the divide as the May 12 assembly election is approaching. In Mangasandra with a population of about 1000, the divide is clear between Above Poverty Line(APL) and Below Poverty Line(BPL) families and also caste divide between Vokkaliga, Kuruba,SC/ST and Minority communities. The Kolar constituency is witnessing tough fight between former agriculture minister Srinivasa Gowda of JD(S) and Syed Zameer Pasha of Congress. The Kuruba, SC/ST and Minority population is showing greater preference for Congress while the Vokkaliga and Reddy communities along with a few OBC castes are consolidating behind Srinivasa Gowda. While Om Shakti Chalapathy of BJP too is giving a fight, incumbent MLA Varthur Prakash of Namma Congress is determined to have the last laugh against his opponents from three bigger parties.While the BPL families are generally appreciative of Siddaramaiah government's welfare programmes, the APL families are miffed as they are not getting 30kg rice at concessional price of Rs10.Farming sustains the livelihood of about 60% of the population of the villagers, sericulture and dairy farming are drawing a large segment with hope of more steady income.Rain hits sweet dreams of Mango growersThe recent spell of rains and gale wings has hit the mango growers of Kolar and Srinivasapura. ""We had suffered due to a spell of untimely rains during the flowering season of mango. Just a couple of weeks back the fresh spell of rain and gusty winds has hit the crop,"" rues Chandrappa, a mango farmer in Srinivasapura.""Our yield is likely to go down by 30%. Now we are keeping our fingers crossed about the price we get,"" Chandrappa adds.Srinivasapura, the mango hub of the region is equally well known for its fierce political battle between Health Minister Ramesh Kumar and his arch rival Venkatashiva Reddy. The constituency has never seen its MLA score a repeat victory. It is always alternative terms for Ramesh Kumar and Venkatashiva Reddy here. Will Ramesh Kumar break the sequenced and humble Reddy again is the question that is being hotly debated in the constituency."

Your garden requires food and water. But,above all, it requires your love and affection, like your child, says 62-year-old PV Ramanna from Hyderabad. He started gardening in 1998. In the last 20 years, he has developed a number of hybrid plants over an area of 1,500 sq ft. He says, Gardening has been my hobby since childhood. When I used to work at ISCO fertilisers, I did not get much time to take care of my garden, but post-retirement, Im a full-fledged gardener. I could not be more content.His interests lies mainly in developing hybrid varieties of flowers. Lotus, jasmine, hibiscus, frangipani and lily plants have occupied a considerable space in his garden. He explains that flowers come in different shapes, sizes and hues. They are not just visually appealing, but enhance your mood too. A flower garden can be developed even by a novice with zero investment, he says. Apart from this, he has also developed an organic garden with vegetables and fruits.Vegetables include tomatoes, green chilies, lady fingers, eggplant and drumstick. He says, Planting a single tomato plant can give you 4 kgs of tomatoes in one entire season. By planting these in pots, you enjoy the pleasure of savouring delicious, sun-warmed vegetables fresh from your garden. Moreover, you dont have to go to the grocery store each time. Just pick the right spot, make sure the soil bed is not weed-ridden and there is plenty of sunlight.Mango, strawberry, pomegranate, banana, sapota are some of the fruits he grows. He makes sure the soil is free from pesticides and occasionally removes unwanted weeds. He has been using kitchen waste, dried leaves and cow dung to make compost. He spends around three hours in the morning and evening to water the garden. He has designed a rooftop water harvesting process that stores rainwater to water the plants, especially when there is water scarcity in the city.On his terrace garden, one can find a plethora of potted plants and birds. The potted plants are placed on a raised cemented platform. He says, Usually, the potted plants are placed on the terrace slab. The water draining out of these pots is wasted. I have designed cemented pots in such a way that the excess water flows into miniature tubs. Birds such as pigeons, crows, bulbuls and koels come here for their early morning bath. It is very pleasing and soothing to watch them, and the birds also stay hydrated during the scorching heat.The list does not end here. Ramanna also owns around eight aquariums with varieties of fish, including ten types of different coloured shrimp. He says that a garden is a major source of stress relief. He, along with his wife Uma Ramanna, are working together to promote the importance of plants in theirneighbourhood."

Born and raised in Kumbakonam, catering has been her family business for many years. Sambar and rasam run in my genes. Cooking is like yoga, it gives me peace of mind, says Prema mami, as she is fondly called. It is this dedicated hobby and love for food that has turned into a full-time profession. And Prema mami has a specific mission too. People should know that there is lot to offer in vegetarian Tamil cuisine, too,she says.Premas husband is also a chef. He used to work as a senior chef at a five-star hotel in Dubai. My husbands way of thinking is different from mine. I focus more on the homemade traditional recipes but I also like cooking North Indian and Chinese items, says Prema. Her daughters too draw inspiration from their mothers cooking, and continue to experiment interesting varieties on a daily basis, with her inputs.Prema cooked her first dish, the humble onion uthappam, when she was 10. For the last four years, Prema has been catering food in the US, and in Muscat for three years. Recollecting these experiences, Prema shares, Cooking for international crowd was special. They love homemade food. So they crave for anything fresh and not preheated. I make sure there is a balance in spices, oil and ghee so that you feel light after the meal.Prema is in the city presently, for the annual Mylai Mami Samayal Food Festival, for the fourth time. The spread of 26 varieties starts with panagam (a summer health drink) and has a blend of variety rice, kuzhambu (curries), poriyal (vegetables), sweets like godhumai halwa (wheat), and wraps up with neer mor (buttermilk). We come during vacations to ensure that kids get a taste of these forgotten Tamil vegetarian recipes. Its not often that we make kodamilagai thayir pachadi (capsicum and curd salad) or kathirikai (brinjal) podi curry. I will be making Kanchipuram idli and alwar dosa this time, she shares.Premas dishes dont have garlic or onion. She plans to write a book soon.Morkali with Vathal kuzhambu (A Must-try combination)Ingredients Rice flour: 1 cup  Curd: 2 cups  To saute: Mustard, urud dal and mor mozhaga.(Green chilli soaked in buttermilk or curd for many days and deep fried)Instructions Heat coconut oil and then add mustard, mor mozhaga and urad dal.

He has played host on Masterchef India and Junior Masterchef India and was invited to judge the semi-finale of Masterchef America with Chef Gordon Ramsey. He has been honoured with Dr. S Radhakrishnan National Media Network Award. The Indian Television Academy awarded him for the Best Jury/Anchor on television for Junior Masterchef India. Kapur is also the proud recipient of the prestigious Sir Edmund Hillary Fellowship 2012 from the Government of New Zealand in the field of Food & Beverage and has authored many cookbooks.Hometown: New DelhiEducation: Kapur studied at St Francis De Sales School in New Delhi and is an alumnus of Institute of Hotel Management (IHM), Sector 42, Chandigarh.My Chandigarh connect: I studied hotel management in the city and was a student here from 1997 to 2000 when I graduated. Over the last few years, my work has brought me to the city often.My area of expertise: Having worked with some of the leading hotel chains like the Taj Group of Hotels and The Leela group, I specialise in Indian cuisines and, in recent years, in food research. I am also a passionate photographer and gardener.My secret to success: There are many things that make a person successful and there are a lot of people involved in ones journey. It starts as early as school and college with our teachers. So has been the case with me, but when I look back I think my travels in India and around the world have really been key to my success as a chef. Travel helped me embrace not just all kinds of food but also different people and cultures.The turning point: For me, the turning point came when I actually started loving what I do. Let me explain why I say this. Initially, my life was very hectic. I would work long hours and weekends. At that point, I started comparing myself with people who would have weekends off or had more time on their hands. Then one day I accepted that this was how it was going to be. The day I accepted it, things changed. I started to enjoy what I do.What I owe to Chandigarh: My stay in Chandigarh was my first time away from home. My parents were initially very apprehensive. But when I came here, I didnt feel out of place. I saw how people bonded with each other. Every festival  be it Lohri, Diwali, Holi  it would be a community affair. I imbibed this community spirit. Chandigarh helped me hone my tastebuds, especially when it came to kebabs and curries. As young students we survived on humble meals that cost as little as Rs 10 and this included unlimited rotis. It taught me humility. I also learnt to appreciate the simplicity of meals and the essence of Punjabi khaana (food) here.Things I like to do when I visit Chandigarh: I always look forward to eating out when I am here. As students, our favourite haunt was the Sector 34 market. I remember a small little takeaway joint here called Chaplin. I love visiting the place when I am in Chandigarh. It brings back memories of college days. We relished all meals here including the speciality - tomato paneer. The owner knew we lived on a budget and would always give a little extra portion, including complimentary salad. I have been hooked to the place ever since my first year of college.How has the city changed over the years: I think not just cities but people change as well. Its progression. I think over the years, I have become better and my Institute has become better too. But I must say I hate how the roundabouts now have traffic signals. I still love Sukhna Lake even though it is overcrowded. I think the city has evolved but maintained an old world charm.The change I would want to see in the city: I come from Delhi and over there I see a disconnect between people and those who run it. I want the residents of Chandigarh and the people who manage it to have a better bonding. I feel it is important for a city to move forward together. I would like Chandigarh to maintain its identity and be a better city not just with regard to infrastructure but in arts as well. I remember reading how Le Corbusier emphasised art and I think efforts should be made to keep it alive.The secret of success in the hospitality industry: I always tell people who are keen about a career in hospitality or are pursuing hotel management to laugh out loud and sometimes laugh at yourself. It is a very stressful environment to work in. Its equally important to put your head down and learn. Youngsters shouldnt worry about the money. It is more important to get the skill right, the money will follow."

He had already spent Rs 50,000 in preparing his two acre field and now it was becoming difficult to recover the input cost.Balchandra Bhagat, a resident of Dobi said every year his family earned from cultivating tomatoes, but this year it had been a total loss.Rakesh said Sehore had made a name for itself in tomato cultivation and its produce was exported up to Delhi in North and down south to Hyderabad and last year the farmers of this area had earned up to Rs 1.25 lakh per acre by selling tomatoes on an average as a result of which a large number of farmers decided to plant it this season too.Commissioner and director horticulture Satyanand said tomatoes were multiple harvest crop and most of the farmers had sold a portion of their produce when prices were high.This is the fag end of the season and there is the final burst of production for which prices must have crashed, the commissioner said saying that he personally had not heard of farmers throwing tomatoes on the road."

Whatever could be salvaged after his emotional outburst, he placed in a heap and put up a sign: Take farm produce for free.That was barely a week after another farmer in Jalna, Premising Chavan, was videographed taking a hoe to a healthy cauliflower field. Days after the video of the apoplectic Chavan destroying his crop was shared widely on WhatsApp, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray met him in Mumbai and handed over aid offered by a private organisation. Cauliflower prices were hovering around Rs 500 a quintal. Its not possible to even cover cost of cultivation and harvest and transport at such prices, Bochate told The Indian Express over the phone. Being able to afford my two boys school fees is increasingly difficult.Instances of farmers dumping their produce on roadsides, witnessed across the country in the aftermath of demonetisation, appear to have returned to Maharashtras countryside as vegetable prices plummet. Days after nearly 40,000 tribals, other farmers and farm labourers marched from Nashik to Mumbai last month, some farmers in northern Nashik dumped tomatoes on the roadside. Prices that week dipped to Rs 200 a quintal in Nashik.Shriram Gadhave, president of the Narayangaon-based Vegetable Growers Association of India, said vegetable prices will remain depressed through the coming summer owing to increased farm area under vegetables. The rains were good, and the water table has improved, so many farmers go in for vegetables expecting good prices in the summer season, he said.Until four or five years back, the pockets around Narayangaon and Nashik used to supply a large percentage of the states tomatoes, he said. But now production is coming in from all corners of the state. Whether its Aurangabad or Beed or elsewhere, local tomatoes are now available in plenty.The promise of better access to processing industries has not borne fruit for vegetable farmers  the capacity of processing industries is barely 2 to 3 per cent of the crop, according to Gadhave. Bochate, who used to drive a Bolero that he purchased with a loan, sold the vehicle two years back to focus on farming.I used to grow soybean before. After I sold the Bolero I repaid the loan and dug a borewell on my land. There was plenty of water, so I was expecting Rs 3 lakh from my tomatoes and brinjal this season, he said. Instead, he was offered Rs 25 per 20-kg crate  that wouldnt cover even the auto ride to the market and the cost of cultivation and harvest.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Onion prices have recorded a correction at a time when the central government has announced a special initiative for the crop along with tomato and potato.Onion prices have dipped again in the wholesale markets with the bulb trading below Rs 1,000 per quintal. A bumper crop in Maharashtra as well as early arrival of rabi onions in the wholesale markets of states like Gujarat and Rajasthan led to a steep price correction which traders say is likely to remain for the rest of the season. On Wednesday, the average price of onions at Lasalagon wholesale market in Nashik was Rs 788 per quintal  one third of the price it fetched in January. Onion prices have been showing a downward trend since the beginning of March. In most wholesale markets, average traded price was below Rs 1,000 per quintal.This is in sharp contrast to the price trend a few weeks back when prices were hovering between Rs 1,500-2,000 per quintal. Prices had crossed the Rs 3,000 mark in November, December and January which spiked the prices in the retail markets as well. The eight-month bull run, farmers had said, had come after almost a 15 month slump which saw farmers selling onions at throw away prices of Rs 300-5,00 quintals. The price slump is due a bumper summer or rabi crop which has started arriving in the markets. Maharashtra has reported around 3.5 lakh hectares under summer onion this year as against the 3 lakh hectares last year. Also onion crop area has increased in neighbouring states of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. Maharashtra accounts for almost 60 per cent of the summer crop.Farmers normally store their produce in moisture and heat proof structures called Kanda chawl to dispose them of later in the season. Rabi onions normally feed the market from March till the arrival of the new kharif crop later in September.Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of Lasalgaons wholesale market, said that the bumper arrivals have brought down prices. Arrival is huge and thus prices have come down. We fear prices might go down further in view of the good crop expected, he said.Onion prices have recorded a correction at a time when the central government has announced a special initiative for the crop along with tomato and potato. Under Operation Green, the government wishes to re-construct the success in the dairy sector under Operation Flood. However, as prices come down, traders say exports have also taken a hit despite nil minimum export price (MEP). There is no demand from the outside markets, said Jagdish Apshunde, an exporter at Nashiks wholesale market. Till November last year, the country had recorded 17,72, 254.31 quintals of onion export.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

The model contract law, a copy of which has been reviewed by Hindustan Times, follows the Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2018.Conceived in the 1960s, APMC regulations require farmers to sell to licenced middlemen only in notified markets, usually in the same area as the farmer, rather than directly to buyers elsewhere.These rules were meant to protect farmers from being forced into distress selling. Over time, they have spawned layers of intermediaries, stretching the farm-to-fork supply chain. This results in a large price spread, meaning fragmentation of profit share because of the presence of too many middlemen.Usually, farmers get the lowest share of profit. APMCs have also become hubs for cartels that rig the system to offer lower prices to farmers while driving up prices for consumers. India has about 6,800 such public-sector markets.The revised Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2018, now set to be released to states, allows firms to sign advance contracts with farmers to grow a chosen crop or its specific variety with a buy-back assurance at an agreed price, giving cultivators a ready market without the oversight of the APMC system.A model law isnt presented in Parliament, but is instead sent to states for passage since the Centre cannot bring laws to regulate agriculture marketing, which falls in the states domain.To work around APMC markets, the budget for fiscal 2019 has also proposed to develop 22,000 new or existing private rural markets.The revised provisions of the model contract law state that businesses and farmers can enter into contracts for any crop, livestock breed or poultry of their choice. The earlier version, released for public scrutiny on January 23, restricted contract farming to only those crops that are allowed by states.The model law provides for dispute settlement at the level of the tehsil, or local administrative unit. It does away with an earlier provision that disputes could be taken for appeal to a decree court. Instead, the parties can escalate it to a three-member local authority, comprising an independent farmer, a corporate representative and a domain expert, all unrelated to the contracting parties. The law seeks to protect the farmers lands and their title. No business can build permanent structures on a farmers land or seize land. Registrations of contracts will be completely online, the model law says. The earlier version provided for physical contracts.Technological advancement with better agricultural practices makes contract farmers more technically and economically efficient, according to a 2016 post-doctoral study on contract farming in Punjab by Nivedita Sharma of the New Delhi-based Jawaharlal Nehru University.In most cases of contract farming, the sponsor, or the contracting firm, also directly provides most inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, as well as credit and technical skills to the farmers with whom it enters into a deal. This lowers the market risk for farmers.Several states did reform markets and gave direct marketing licences to various kinds of corporate buyers like Tata, Mahindra and Godrej, said R Ravikanth, an analyst with commodity trading firm Comtrade.We dont support contract farming because it is another form of exploitation. Why isnt there a provision that all produce will be contracted above minimum support prices? said Pema Ram, a leader of the All India Kisan Sabha.Most of these licences are not in use, Ravikanth added, because it is difficult to coordinate with a large number of small farmers. Current examples of contract farming include PepsiCo Inc. for tomato in Punjab, SABMiller Plc. for barley and McCain Foods Ltd for potato in Gujarat."

An Australian delegation visited the governments centre of excellence at Bassi in Jaipur district recently to study the prospects of introducing the technique in the state.Soon, the Australian government will send a formal proposal for sharing this technique with Rajasthan, after which the work will start, said Prabu Lal Saini, the state agriculture minister.Hydroponics is a method to grow plants without soil, using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent.The three-member delegation, including South Australian governments investment manager (Indian trade) Rahul Ranjan and Australian firm Ironwoods chief consultant Mark Cody, studied the site and infrastructure at the centre for two days beginning January 11.Saini said that hydroponics technique would be used in the farming of tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, cucumber (kheera) and coloured capsicum. The farming of these vegetables will be done in 4,000 square metre area in Bassi. Use of the technique would increase the yields manyfolds, he said.Generally, yield per plant of tomato in three months is around half a kg and when grown in poly house the yield increases to 5-6kg per plant in six months, but through the hydroponics technique, the yield per plant will increase to around 65-70kg per plant in 10 months. Similarly, yield of coloured capsicum and cucumber is around 4kg per plant, which will increase by six times to 24kg per plant, he informed. Such innovations will help in doubling the income of farmers, he added.The crop will be grown vertically to accommodate more plants in the same area, thus increasing the yield. More production of vegetables will help in curbing hike in prices and common man can get quality vegetables at affordable prices, he said.Once it is started at Bassi, hydroponics will be propagated to farmers in the state, he said. Even during these two years of pilot move, an Indian version of hydroponics technique will be developed so that farmers can afford it, he added.The agriculture department has sanctioned 13 crore for the two-year project starting from June this year. Saini said the department has constituted a committee to speed up the project. The project will be supervised by Rajasthan Olive Cultivation Limited (ROCL)."

By March 15, the botanists aim to scan more than 25,000 specimens and will send the digital images to the BSI.The BSI mooted the proposal in 2013 and it took them more than five years to ink the deal. The pioneer flora institute has plans to send 12 more botanists to London so that the scanning can be completed within a year to streamline the database, Singh said.The Portuguese introduced potato and tomato to India, he said.Being a staple food item in India, there is a need to identify the species that belong to the family, he said.We know of kand-mool, which has reference in historical transcripts but it was replaced by potato and tomato.The specimens at the London museum will help us to identify alternates of the two crops so that we can harvest the plants as well.Botanists are also scanning plant species from neighbouring countries, including Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar and this will help in understanding the genesis of different plant species."

However, at present, the prices are Rs 4 to Rs 8 per kg.The retail prices of tomato are around Rs 8 to Rs 10 per kg, he said.Giving reasons for the low prices, he said that tomato production increases in Kota and nearby areas in winter due to which prices come down around this time every year.Production of tomatoes in Bundi, Deoli region of Tonk, Kota, Sawai Madhopur and other nearby areas goes up in January-February every year. Due to this, tomato prices drop. But the prices go up during the monsoon season when there is no production of tomatoes locally and it is brought from other states such as Maharashtra and Karnataka, said Girish Dalwani , a tomato wholesaler.According to the horticulture department, tomato is cultivated on approximately 3,500 hectares of land in Kota division."
