In fact, DySP Srinivas, Puttur Rural Circle Inspector Gopal Naik, Uppinangady Sub Inspector Nandakumar and other police personnel were camping in Mithamajalu since morning.When ANF members showed the photographs of a few Maoists to the inmates of the house, they (residents) said that the Maoists have identified themselves as ""Rajesh"" and ""Latha"".Mithamajalu, situated two-kilometres away from National Highway has 40 houses, of which three houses are situated on the periphery of the forest. The Maoist members had visited the houses on Sunday night. However, it was kept a secret till Monday evening. It was through schoolchildren that the news was spread among the villagers.Puttur DySP Srinivas said that the visit of Maoists to the houses has been confirmed. Two teams of ANF have started combing operations.'Did not threaten'One of the residents of the house that the Maoists visited said, ""The members just informed that they were Maoists and asked us not to inform anyone. They did not threaten us.""A team with two men and a woman entered the house at 7.30 pm on Sunday. After introducing themselves as Purushotham, Rajesh and Latha, they asked for groceries. ""When I informed that there is no rice and asked them whether they needed dosa and tea, they replied in the negative."" They also wanted to know whether there is any rich person's house in the village, the resident said.When my brother visited the house, they accompanied him to his house. They were in my house for 10 minutes only. All were wearing green trousers and shirt and were armed, the resident said.Her brother said, ""Maoist Rajesh asked for 10 kg of rice. When I said there are no shops nearby, they demanded rice from the house. They have taken 3 kg boiled rice, 8 kg white rice, tomato and potato from my house.""Enquiries madeThe trio were also asking for Biju, whom they said had reportedly informed the police about their visit to Subrahmanya last time.As a result, one of their collegue Yellappa was killed in crossfire with the ANF (in 2012).Another resident said: ""I encountered three members of the Maoists first. My parents had gone to the temple on account of Sankranti. When I heard dogs barking, I came out of the house and saw three armed persons at my yard. When they introduced themselves as Maoists, I ran towards my uncle's house."""

TGIFridays has recently launched their hangover brunch every weekend, which has all the right appetisers, entrees and desserts to satisfy your hungover heart, as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks to either refresh you, or keep the buzz going.We started the meal with some mocktails  the Basil Peach Cooler and the Gold Mango Margarita, both of which were a tad bit too strong for our tastes, but were also high on flavour and taste. We tried the Chocolate Milkshake next, which was rich, thick and decadent  just how a good milkshake should be.If you are looking to keep their spirits high by taking care of your hangover with another drink, try Hangover Bloody Mary. This drink, is a meal in itself. The tall glass, the classic tomato juice-based cocktail is served in, is decorated with a lamb slider, chicken wings, fries and celery sticks - an ideal meal for one. The red wine sangria is also a good option  sweeter and full of fruit than sangrias served in most other places.TGIF has a number of options in appetisers. From egg-heavy dishes such as Breakfast Tacos and Breakfast Potato Skins, to fried food for the hungover soul. We tried the Calamari Frites, and though hesitant to try shellfish in places not directly on the coast, we found this dish to be fresh, crispy and delicious, complemented perfectly with marinara sauce. We also tried the Friday Mushrooms - crispy batter fried mushrooms served with a sauce.For mains, we first tried the Classic American Veg Pizza, and though not up to par with the some of the great pizza Bengaluru has been serving up of late, it does have a very homemade feel to it. The Pasta Alfredo is not for the faint hearted or the almost-full, as it is very creamy and rich, just the way an Alfredo ought to be. The winner among the mains for us was the Hangover Burger, again, meant for someone with a hearty appetite. This delicious monster has a juicy lamb patty paired with bacon, caramelized onions and all your other burger fixings, and is topped off with a fried egg. Some of the other good options among the mains are the Steak and Eggs and the Crispy Chicken Sliders.For dessert, we thought wed keep it simple, and the brunch menu has also stuck to the same theme by only listing two dishes. We tried the Sizzling Brownie, and it was one of the best weve had in recent times, and also much bigger than most. Served with large scoop of vanilla ice cream and generous amounts of chocolate sauce, it was the perfect end to this gastronomic meal.The Hangover brunch is on every Saturday and Sunday, 12 noon to 3 pm. Prices start at ` 1,695."

Experts say that at least for the next two months the markets are expected to be filled with vegetables costing fraction of their prices prevailing a few days ago. In Karnataka, vegetable growers are more in Kolar, Bengaluru Rural, Chikballapur, Chitradurga, Ramanagara, Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar, Hassan and other places. With good rain this monsoon, growers could get good yield too. The price of many vegetables has come around Rs 20 per kilo which was more than Rs 70 a few months back. While the tomato has declined to Rs 11 per kilo, pumpukin is Rs 13 per kg, raddish is Rs 18, snake gourd is Rs 18, while beetroot and potato are Rs 22 per kg, according to the Horticultural Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS) price list.Former additional director (Fruits), Dr S V Hittalamani, explained that this was because the state witnessed good monsoon rainfall in 2017. The lakes and rivers had filled, and groundwater had charged up.With this, farmers used borewell for water and it was an advantage for vegetable growers to grow larger quantities of vegetables. If there is more supply than demand, naturally the price declines. This is what has happened now, he said.Citing an example, Hittalamani said tomatoes grown on 6,000 hectares of land yielded around one lakh tones of tomatoes. But this year, with more farmers using their land for growing tomatoes, they have used 18,000 hectares of land and grown three lakh tones of tomatoes as compared to last year. If the quantity is thrice, one can imagine the price slash. In winter season, tomatoes normally grow. This year, growers in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra have also grown good quantities of tomatoes. This means there is no demand for our tomatoes in these states, he said.People, vendors happyAruna, a resident of Rajarajeshwarinagar bought carrot, onion, potato, peas, beans, chilies and curry leaves, all half kg to one kg. Even after buying so much, my bill was hardly D100. I was happy to buy veggies this cheap, she said. She said just a couple of months back, she used to spend D250 for the same quantity of vegetables. The vendors too are happy. Carrot was D90 per kg just a couple of months ago, now it has dropped to D45. Similarly, potato was D80 per kg and it has fallen to D22. People do come to buy vegetables even if the price is increased, Rudresh, a vegetable vendor at Vijayanagar said. Another vendor, Mahesh at Shivajinagar, said customers are happy. We too are happy that they are buying more in quantity, he said.From less supply to tomato glutAccording to deputy director of horticulture department Chandrashekar, just a few months ago there was demand for tomatoes as there was less supply. The price of tomatoes had reached D90 per kg. It was then that farmers started growing tomoatoes thinking there would be good price in the market. Tomatoes need three months to grow. There was good rain, that added as an advantage to them. There is good supply and price has naturally come down, he said. In summer, with some virus or the other, the yield of tomatoes will come down, and the price of tomatoes will increase during that time."

This is because the state government hasnt fixed any rates for vegetables, Narayana Gowda, one of the farmers in Kolar district, said.Since there is no minimum support price (MSP) for food grains and crops, the pricing of fruits and vegetables is left to the market forces.Narayana Gowda, who is from Hosmatanahalli in Kolar district, said, over `70,000 is spent to grow vegetables in an acre. The cost includes pesticides and other agro-based expenses. We grow and take care of it for three months day and night. But in return, we get pittance. The middlemen are rampant.Now that the supply is more than the demand in the market, the middlemen are purchasing tomato, beans and brinjal for `3 each (per kg), capcicum for `15 and ladies finger for `5 (per kg). We are not getting any profit. Whatever we are getting we are spending it on transporation and also for the coolies at our farms. The coriander leaves are sold at `10 per bundle. One can imagine our plight. Where should we go? he asked.Srinivasa, another farmer demanded that farmers flea market be held at every panchayath or hobli level once a week or fortnight. At least we can go sell our products directly to the consumers, and get some profit. We can also avoid the middlemen, he said.Chennagowda, a farmer who grows tomatoes in Kolar, said tomato price came down to `4 per kilo to `3 a few days ago. In fact, it even went down to `2 last month. We put in a lot of effort to grow it for 100 days, but this is what we get. Every political party leader comes to us before elections with assurances, but nothing is done. If we do not get money, how can we take care of our wives and children,  he said."

An Australian delegation visited the governments centre of excellence at Bassi in Jaipur district recently to study the prospects of introducing the technique in the state.Soon, the Australian government will send a formal proposal for sharing this technique with Rajasthan, after which the work will start, said Prabu Lal Saini, the state agriculture minister.Hydroponics is a method to grow plants without soil, using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent.The three-member delegation, including South Australian governments investment manager (Indian trade) Rahul Ranjan and Australian firm Ironwoods chief consultant Mark Cody, studied the site and infrastructure at the centre for two days beginning January 11.Saini said that hydroponics technique would be used in the farming of tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, cucumber (kheera) and coloured capsicum. The farming of these vegetables will be done in 4,000 square metre area in Bassi. Use of the technique would increase the yields manyfolds, he said.Generally, yield per plant of tomato in three months is around half a kg and when grown in poly house the yield increases to 5-6kg per plant in six months, but through the hydroponics technique, the yield per plant will increase to around 65-70kg per plant in 10 months. Similarly, yield of coloured capsicum and cucumber is around 4kg per plant, which will increase by six times to 24kg per plant, he informed. Such innovations will help in doubling the income of farmers, he added.The crop will be grown vertically to accommodate more plants in the same area, thus increasing the yield. More production of vegetables will help in curbing hike in prices and common man can get quality vegetables at affordable prices, he said.Once it is started at Bassi, hydroponics will be propagated to farmers in the state, he said. Even during these two years of pilot move, an Indian version of hydroponics technique will be developed so that farmers can afford it, he added.The agriculture department has sanctioned 13 crore for the two-year project starting from June this year. Saini said the department has constituted a committee to speed up the project. The project will be supervised by Rajasthan Olive Cultivation Limited (ROCL)."

(Source: Thinkstock images) Representative Image. (Source: Thinkstock images)They say bigger is better, but in the succulent world of cherry tomatoes, one Israeli company is going smaller than ever before. The drop tomato is about the size of a blueberry and the Kedma company in the countrys southern Arava desert says it is the smallest one ever cultivated in Israel, perhaps even in the world, reports news agency AP. Its a point of pride in a country known for its agricultural innovation, where fruits and vegetables are taken seriously and where several strands of the cherry tomato were first invented.The idea is that it is comfortable, said Ariel Kidron, a Kedma grower. You can throw it in a salad, you dont need to cut it. It just explodes in your mouth. The seed, originally developed in Holland, was modified to match the arid growing conditions in southern Israel. Rami Golan, of the Central and Northern Arava Research and Development center, who accompanied the project, said it was definitely the smallest ever to be grown in Israel where tomatoes are incredibly popular.The tiny tomato, smaller than a one shekel Israeli coin, is offered in red and yellow varieties and will be presented to the public at a three-day international agricultural fair in Israel later this month. Early indications are it could be a big hit. Shaul Ben Aderet, a well-known Israeli chef who owns three restaurants, including Tel Avivs Blue Rooster, got some early samples and says the new strand is packed with flavor and will spawn an infinite number of new recipes. He offered it sizzled in a pan, baked into focaccia bread and as a straight-up snack.Its very simple, its clean, its nice, its sexy, he said. In a blind taste test alongside two sweets, he said, they would say the tomato is a candy, thats for sure.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

The strike later gained steam as thousands of farmers from across the state joined it. The genesis of the strike was in Puntamba village, in Rahata taluka of Ahmednagar, where villagers had passed a resolution in the Gram Sabha and called for a strike. The strike later gained steam as thousands of farmers from across the state joined it.Various farmers groups from the state, which had played a crucial role in the strike last year, have decided to stay away from the nation-wide farmers strike that is scheduled to start on June 1. The strike has been called by the All India Kisan Sabha. Shivkumar Sharma, convenor of the Sabha, has asked farmers to ensure that supply of milk and fresh produce to 40 major cities are disrupted as that, he said, will force the government to accept their demands.The farmers demands include proper implementation of the M S Swaminathan Committees recommendations as well as a complete loan waiver.However, days before the strike, farmers groups from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune have declared that they will not participate in the strike. Deepak Bhise, president of the Junnar District Tomato Growers Association, said such strikes cause even more financial losses to farmers. Last year, farmers had incurred heavy losses due to the strike, which was sabotaged by some so-called leaders we do not wish to repeat our losses, he said.ALSO READ | High procurement of crop means little to farmers: Yogendra YadavMost farmers in Maharashtra were waiting for the monsoon to begin their sowing operations, said Bhise.Hansraj Wadghule, a leader of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana from Nashik, said they will not participate in the strike. More than 3,000 cases were filed against farmers last year and they are yet to be withdrawn. We do not wish to involve farmers in this years strike, he said.During Shetkari Sampa, the seven-day strike last year, farmers had stopped supplying milk and vegetables to urban markets. However, within a day of the strike, a section of farmer leaders had tried to call it off after late-night talks with the government. Farmers from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune refused to call it off and eventually, the government agreed to the demands of the farmers and announced a Rs 30,000-crore loan waiver.The genesis of the strike was in Puntamba village, in Rahata taluka of Ahmednagar, where villagers had passed a resolution in the Gram Sabha and called for a strike. The strike later gained steam as thousands of farmers from across the state joined it.However, Puntamba sarpanch Dr Dhanajay Dhanvate said the village residents will not participate in this years strike.Undeterred by the many groups which are not participating in strike called by the All India Kisan Sabha, its organisers said they have received overwhelming response from farmers from across the length and breadth of the country. In Maharashtra, a section of the so-called farmer leaders have opposed the strike, but we are certain farmers will support it, said Sandeep Gidde, one of the organisers of the strike.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

This price is recovered from the farmers. At present, transport charges range between Rs 10 and 40 per kg, depending on the distance. This price is recovered from the farmers.As fuel prices rise by the day, experts have hinted that a similar upward trend is likely to be seen in the prices of everyday essentials. Prices of vegetables, which have remained steady throughout the summer, might see a 20-25 per cent rise if fuel price rise continues.At Pune and Pimpris wholesale markets, most of the vegetables have remained between the price range of Rs 10 and 40 per kg. A glut in production, as a result of almost 10 per cent increase in the area of production across the state, has resulted in the collapse of prices.Vegetables such as green peas, cauliflower, cabbage, carrot, et cetera are mostly trading in the range of Rs 10-15 per kg, which, traders said, is because of healthy arrivals. Tomato, in most wholesale markets, is trading at Rs 5-8 per kg, while in the retail markets the prices are about Rs 10-15 per kg. Onion prices, too, are at an all-time low, as a production glut has tilted the demand-supply ratio. However, as diesel prices are touching an all-time high, traders fear an imminent rise in the prices of vegetables.Vilas Bhujbal, president of the Traders and Commission Agents Association of Punes Gultekdi market, said the transporters have not taken the decision to increase prices as they were hopeful of a quick correction in the prices. However, if the present trend continues, a sharp increase in prices is likely, he said. Transporters act as a conduit between farmers and wholesale markets like Pune, to ferry perishable commodities like vegetables. Normally, these are village-level entrepreneurs who charge farmers per crate or per kg to transport their ware. For a market like Pune, transporters bring produce from neighbouring districts as well as from states like Karnataka, Kerala etc.At present, transport charges range between Rs 10 and 40 per kg, depending on the distance. This price is recovered from the farmers. Bhujbal said if fuel prices continue to rise, the transport charges may increase by 10-15 per cent immediately. This will effect the prices in the wholesale markets and, subsequently, the retail customer will get vegetables at a higher rate, he said. However, many growers said transporters have already effected a rise at their end.Deepak Bhise, president of the Tomato Growers Association of Junnar taluka in Pune district, said wholesale prices have but collapsed. As farmers, we have to use diesel for our tractors, our machines run on diesel. So, this is pinching us hard, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Express Photo By Partha Paul Prices had skyrocketed after July last year as supply was severely hit in the face of low availability of the produce. Express Photo By Partha PaulTomato growers are reeling from heavy losses, hit by low exports and higher produce as the vegetable is cultivated on more areas than before.Tomato exports slumped in 2017-18 with India recording exports worth only Rs 107.21 crore compared to Rs 548.15 crore in 2016-17. Exports to Pakistan and Bangladesh, major destinations for Indian tomatoes, were especially hit. Last year, just about Rs 34 lakh worth of tomatoes were exported to Pakistan compared to Rs 368.45 crore in 2016-17. Exports to Bangladesh last year were just Rs 4.8 crore compared to Rs 66.69 crore in 2016-17.Political tension between India and Pakistan led to the suspension of exports via land to Pakistan last year. Exports to Bangladesh were hit after it increased the import duty on agricultural products to an whopping 48 per cent. In Maharashtra, Junnar taluka and neighbouring areas in Pune district are the major growers of rabi tomato, which feeds the markets from March till August. After that, tomatoes from Niphad, Satana and other areas in Nashik district feed the market and stay till around February.Prices had skyrocketed after July last year as supply was severely hit in the face of low availability of the produce. Farmers in Junnar had stopped using fertilisers and insecticides after March due to lower realisations. The wholesale market at Narayangaon in Junnar and at Pimpalgaon in Nashik are the major tomato markets for rabi and karif crops respectively.This year, Junnar farmers had failed to recover their expenses as till about late May they had to sell the vegetable at Rs 2-3 per kg. Traders had blamed the suspension of trade with Pakistan and Bangladesh for the bloodbath in the wholesale markets. Besides, instead of the customary 30,000 acres of plantation, this year Junnar and its neighbouring area had seen tomato cultivation on over 40,000 acres.The spectre of low prices looms large even as the state stares at another bumper cultivation for the kharif crop.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"
