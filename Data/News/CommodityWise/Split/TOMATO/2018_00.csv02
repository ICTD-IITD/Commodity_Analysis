Of the 125 lakh tonnes of wheat procured in the state during the current season so far, 65 lakh tonnes are being stored in the open.In technical terms, it is called covered at plinths (CAP) storage, which is a great cause of concern for the state government. The wheat stored in open is exposed to the vagaries of weather, and has shorter life. But what makes it worse are the piling up stocks of grains.There are 25 lakh tonnes of wheat of the previous season and officials in the Food Corporation of India (FCI), the central body that runs nationwide public distribution system, say the state will have a backlog of wheat of one full season (at least 125 lakh tonnes), hinting at tougher days ahead for the states food and civil supplies department.Besides, some more wheat of the current season is expected to arrive in the mandis. The state godowns also have 100 lakh tonnes of rice.Must read | Tomato prices crash in Punjab, Haryana due to bulk suppliesState procurement agencies have witnessed the second highest arrival of wheat this year after 2012-13 when 130 lakh tonnes of wheat was procured. Officials of state food agencies said such a pile-up in the CAP storage was not witnessed for the past five years.Another worrying factor is the fall in the monthly movement of foodgrains (wheat and rice) from the state, from an average of 18 lakh tonnes in the previous year (2016-17) to 15 lakh tonnes in the (2017-18) current year.Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are no longer consumer states and they have become self-sufficient in foodgrains. Also, Madhya Pradesh is now contributing to the national pool, said an FCI official, on the condition of anonymity.Besides, Haryana is expected to contribute additional 10 lakh tonned of foodgrains into national kitty this year (a total of 85 lakh tonnes as against 75 lakh tonnes in the previous year), which will cut down the demand for Punjab wheat, he added.Punjab has a covered storage space (godowns) capacity of 152 lakh tonnes for both rice and wheat, and 4.75 lakh tonne capacity in steel silos for wheat storage. This entire space is already full, according to officials.We are prevailing upon the FCI to make movement of foodgrains faster. If the quality of grains gets affected due to CAP storage, Punjab will be at a loss, said state principal secretary, food and civil supplies, KAP Sinha.The FCI official suggested that the state could easily store 30 lakh tonnes of freshly procured wheat in CAP storage to save covered storage space, as it would cut infrastructure cost to one-third.30 lakh tonnes of wheat kept from April to September in CAP storage would move out easily, he said."

Now they get quality power for eight hours a day with a capital investment of just Rs. 50,000 per unit thanks to the government subsidy of Rs. 4.50 lakh. They also need not go to their farms in the dead of the night as was the practice earlier, say a group of enterprising farmers from Bobbepalli village, tucked away from the Chennai-Kolkata highway.'There is no marketing problem for these vegetables as they have longer shelf life and better freshness, they say in a conversation with The Hindu .The farmers from the village have tied up with traders in the Koyambedu wholesale market in Chennai to market the hybrid vegetables, including carrot, beetroot and onions, tomato grown with the help of solar-powered pumpsets through a network of micro-irrigation system to grow more crop for every drop of water with water soluble fertilizers.On harvesting, we send the vegetables to Chennai, 350 km away and payments are credited online to our bank account on delivery, says a happy farmer D. Srinivasa Rao as he monitors his 30-acre farm on his CCTV.They sell the vegetables locally when prices are almost the same in the Martur market, from where they are marketed by wholesale traders in different parts of the country, adds another farmer J. Haribabu.D. Anjaneyulu, a product of a Business school in Visakhapatnam, has taken to farming as his profession at a time when his peers shied from agriculture in view of the uncertain returns.The returns are very much encouraging. But one has to toil and also do a smart work as well, says the young farmer who has installed a high-value shade net for ensuring ideal agro-climatic condition for improved productivity. They have also adopted water conservation techniques to retain every drop of rain water, adds yet another farmer J. Bullaiah."

The team members also visited the the tomato fields in Ramasamudram, Madanapalle, Nimmanapalle and Palamaner mandals.Peter Hanson, a U.S.-based lead tomato breeder, who headed the team, was accompanied by Agriculture Market Yard (Madanapalle) chairman Ratakonda Gurappa Naidu, translating the versions of farmers for the team on the field. WVC project coordinator, Srikanth Babu, and Scientific Officer J. Karthik recorded the version of tomato growers.Mr. Hanson said the Madanapalle variety was amazing with high quality. I appeal to the farmers of this region to go in for dual purpose tomato breeds intended for both processing industries and domestic needs. Though there is much demand for the processing varieties in India and abroad, the production levels are not encouraging. The World Vegetable Center will play a crucial role in guiding the farmers here in the direction of raising dual purpose crops. This will be quite economical and also profitable, he said, adding the experiments to this extent were giving encouraging results at the labs set up in the four mandals. Soon, the fruits of labs will reach the lands, Mr. Hanson said.Mr. Gurappa Naidu said the World Vegetable Center had been actively involved in raising dual purpose tomato varieties after thorough research into the soil and climatic conditions of the region. He said it was a welcome sign that the horticulture scientists had noted that the Madanapalle variety with a stamina to withstand temperatures as high as 45 degrees C could be developed and promoted as a premier crop, with global recognition."

Over the last few weeks, across India the price of potatoes has fallen sharply after a year of bumper production. With the price of a kilogram of potato dropping as low as under a rupee in certain wholesale markets, many distressed farmers have left their produce to rot on the roads, and in cold storage facilities. Curiously, potato prices were many times higher just months ago amid scarce supply. Last year, the price of other produce like red chilli, tur dal and tomato witnessed a similar trend of steep falls compared to the previous season. The sharp swing in prices has been explained by the Cobweb phenomenon. Farmers tend to increase the production of certain crops in response to their high prices during the previous season, which in turn leads to a supply glut that causes prices to crash. The cycle repeats each passing year, with the lag between price and production causing a huge mismatch between supply and demand. The present fall in potato prices comes against the backdrop of a slowdown in the rural economy. According to advance GDP estimates released by the government last week, farm growth is expected to drop from 4.9% in 2016-17 to 2.1% in 2017-18.Given the humanitarian and political costs of agricultural distress, particularly in a year when many big States go to the polls, local governments could turn towards populism to satisfy their rural voter base. This could come in the form of fiscal measures such as farm loan waivers, a higher minimum support price for farm produce, or some combination of the two. The next Union budget may well be focussed on the rural economy through fiscal measures. Such relief measures that temporarily ease the pain on farmers, however, will fail to make a significant difference to their lives in the long run. Any permanent solution to the problem of agricultural distress will have to deal with the challenge of price fluctuations. The boom-and-bust cycle is the result of a broken supply chain that is over-regulated. In the absence of a robust market for buying and selling forward-looking contracts, farmers are left to fend for themselves against severe fluctuations. In addition, the domination of the wholesale market by cartels prevents farmers from receiving a fair price even when their produce is sold at much higher rates to consumers. The government must resolve to address these structural issues, and not limit itself to ad hoc policy measures in firefighting mode. There is a need to give farmers not just a better, but also more stable, return on their crops."

Ladies finger is among the few vegetables that is quoted at Rs. 25 a kg. The price of beans, which hovers around Rs. 70 per kg for most part of the year, has crashed to Rs. 15-20 a kg.Radish and tomato are among the top vegetables that are sold at Rs. 4 and Rs. 6 a kg respectively. In Gandhi Market, which gets its supply of tomato from Bengaluru in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, a kg of top quality tomato was sold at Rs. 6. It was Rs. 8 at Uzhavar Sandhai in Thennur on Thursday.The cost of one box (25 kg) of tomato wasRs. 150 in the wholesale market. There were not many takers for radish as the market was flooded with heavy arrival on Thursday.Retail vendors at Gandhi Market are hardpressed to sell the vegetables. Some traders, who could not clear the arrivals, preferred to dump them as waste, which eventually was transported to Ariyamangalam dump yard on Wednesday.Traders attribute the slump in prices to heavy arrival of vegetables than the actual demand over the past few weeks. Besides the arrivals from Dindigul, Theni, Pollachi, Oddanchathiram, Kallupatty and Vaiyampatty, the market in Tiruchi continues to get excess loads of tomato from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh apparently due to heavy productivity.The prices of vegetables always rule low during winter season as it is conducive for vegetable cultivation. The trend continues this year too. Market is literally dumped with fresh vegetables, says S.M.H. Sulthan, a whole sale vegetable trader at Gandhi Market in Tiruchi.An official at a Uzhavar Sandhai said consumers could carry a bag full of vegetables for 10 days with just Rs. 200. It was a good season for consumers but a bad one for farmers.Several farmers, who brought vegetables from their farms, were distraught over the prevailing market price."

A few days later, Gatto passed on the food baton to compatriot, Chef Gualtiero Marchesi from Villa San Michele, whose dishes are on the menu until February 11.Over glasses of cava, we try a tasting menu which begins with ricotta cheese stuffed in eggplant roll on a bed of delicious tomato concasse. Simple and reliant on local ingredients, the dish is a burst of flavours. The shrimp polenta comes on a bed of cornmeal, and gives us a taste of Italian seafood.Our main course is the risotto we cooked, while we find it a tad bit bland, a generous sprinkle of parmesan shavings does the trick. Our dessert, spumone alla grappa with bitter chocolate ice cream and raspberry sorbet is a let-down as it comes without any spumoni or three-layered gelato. The raspberry sorbet has been replaced by orange marmalade, which adds a tang to the bitter chocolate ice cream.In a conversation after the meal, Gattoo, who arrived in the city a day before our meal, says hes excited to visit the local markets. It is very important to cook with ingredients available locally. No point cooking with things got from all over the world, he tells us, explaining that the menu has been made with vegetarian dishes in mind. The beans here are excellent for pasta e fagioli soup and even the edible flowers are great.Breaking some myths, Gattoo laughs, There is no such thing as pink sauce. We have the mama rosa, but even that is not an authentic Italian dish. After the Second World War, Italy was a poor nation, and many chefs moved out for work. That is when the fusion started. Think pizza with pineapple! Today, you can put anything on a pizza. But food to me is nostalgia, the power of memory, he signs off, recommending his special dish of padava chicken from his hometown.

Kote and surrounding places, said Ramesh, a wholesale dealer. But with excess cultivation this year, the price of the crop has remained low for over a month, he added.For farmers, the cost of cultivating tomato on an acre of land is reckoned to be around Rs. 1 lakh, which includes daily wages of nearly Rs. 400 per head. Cultivators can hope to reap a net profit only if the market price is fixed at around Rs. 10 a kg. Otherwise, it will be a loss, said Mr. Ramesh, who however said that the situation was unlikely to improve for at least another month.The APMC yard in Mysuru receives 20-30 tonnes of tomatoes, the bulk of which is transported to Kerala. The hybrid variety of the produce comes from Hassan and Mandya while the demand from the local market is met with what is cultivated around the region.While seasonal variation in production and price fluctuation is the norm when it comes to agricultural produce, tomato farmers tend to be the worst affected as prices remain low for long as supply mostly outstrips the demand, according to wholesaler dealers at the APMC yard. This only benefits procurement agents and dealers.A few local farmers like Atiahalli Devaraja pointed out that prices pick up when the demand for tomatoes is fuelled by food-processing units involved in the manufacture of jams, pickles and the like. But in case there is a lull in demand or the units outsource the crop for a better rate from other places, then the local farmers are affected, and more so in the absence of refrigeration and storage facilities, he said."
