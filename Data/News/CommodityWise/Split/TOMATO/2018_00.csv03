Sasikalas niece J. Krishnapriya, who grew up in Veda Nilayam in Poes Garden and lived there until her marriage in 2000.Sources privy to Ms. Krishnapriyas deposition made on January 2 before the Justice Arumughaswamy Commission of Inquiry, where she was summoned, said she claimed that Sasikala had thought of taking Jayalalithaa abroad for better treatment sometime in October 2016 when she was in Apollo Hospitals. But the proposal was turned down by Jayalalithaa.On September 23, 2016, at the hospital, her mother Ilavarasi reportedly told her that Jayalalithaa had gained consciousness in the morning and wanted to know where she was.On being told that she was in a hospital, the then Chief Minister smiled and remarked to a doctor that they would not have been able to bring her to the hospital had she been conscious at the time of shifting.Visitor to ICUStating that no one, except Sasikala, was allowed to meet Jayalalithaa when she was in the Intensive Care Unit, Ms. Krishnapriya said she, her mother and her aunt stayed together on the third floor of the hospital and Sasikala alone used to go to the ICU whenever she was called for.While in hospital, Jayalalithaa ate idlis, pongal and tomato rice in small quantities and even had ice cream.She likes fruits Once she ate grapes and began coughing, Ms. Krishnapriya had told the Commission. [Forest Minister Dindigul C. Sreenivasan had last year apologised publicly claiming he and others had lied that Jayalalithaa ate idli in hospital.]According to her, on December 4, 2016, a day before she died, doctors said that Jayalalithaas brain was functional but the heart could not be resuscitated despite putting her on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). When I reached the hospital, a surgery was underway by cutting open her chest right in the ward. Thereafter, the procedure was continued after shifting her to an operation theatre, she added.Medical miracleShe claimed that her aunt Sasikala expected a medical miracle to happen anytime. Therefore, she asked the doctors to continue to keep Jayalalithaa on life support and provide treatment as usual.The deponent had told the Commission that she was not aware whether Jayalalithaas brain was functional when the life support was withdrawn on December 5, 2016.ECMO was discontinued beyond the evening hours of December 5, 2016. One of her saris was brought from home and it was draped around the body before we took it home. The body was then laid in the drawing room of the house and rituals were performed with the assistance of a priest Around seven women assisted in the process, her statement read.No one except Sasikala was allowed to meet Jayalalithaa when she was in the Intensive Care Unit"
5b147cb29855b72e9ad63f6c,Considerable drop in skyrocketing prices of vegetables,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/rate-of-vegatable/articleshow/62358186.cms,2018-01-04,"Indore: A considerable drop in skyrocketing prices of tomato has given a reason to the homemakers to rejoice as once hitting a high of Rs 80/kg in last six months, the essential and perishable commodity of every kitchen has fallen to Rs 10/kg in wholesale market in last around two weeks.Bumper production of tomato and arrival of new crop from Maharashtra are the reasons behind its slashed rate. The wholesale rate of tomato is around Rs 10/kg and its available at Rs 15-20 in retail market, Choithram Sabjimandi Kalyan Sangh secretary Nikhil Hardiya told TOI.He said that as crops supply is expected to reduce, tomatos rate is likely to go up in next month. Wholesale rate of potato is still below Rs 10/kg as good production of the crop and farmers disinterest to keep it in the cold-storage for longtime are stated to be the reasons behind the low-price.Potato is being sold at Rs 7-8 in Choithram wholesale vegetable market while the retail price hovers around Rs 15/kg, Aaloo Pyaaj Vyapari Sangh, Indore vice-president Vijay Garg told TOI.He said that a few weeks ago, potatos wholesale price had hit a new low of the season as the rate had gone down to Rs 1/kg.Quality of the crop, which was sold around Rs 1/kg, was however not as good as what is available in the market. Most of the potato crop, sold earlier, was deteriorating in the cold-storage and to avoid further loss, the farmers sold it at the minimum rate, Garg said.Wholesale rate of garlic has also witnessed a downtrend in recent past.Excess production of the crop is the main reason behind the reduced rate Garg said. Unlike these crops, the rate of another vital commodity i.e. onion has however witnessed a rise.Few weeks ago, the wholesale rate of onion was around Rs 25/kg while the retail price was between Rs 40-45. The crop is now being sold at Rs 30-35/kg in wholesale market while the retail rate is around Rs 50-60/kg Garg said."

With the local crop arriving in plenty and the price of tomatoes hovering between Rs. 8 and Rs. 5 a kg in the recent past, the arrivals at Rythu Bazaars cross beyond the much required quantity.We have been receiving 50 to 60 quintals a day for the past few days against the requirement of 35 quintals, says D. Narayana Rao, Estate Officer (EO) of Rythu Bazaar, Seethammadhara.Comparatively, tomato growers see rich harvest this year in K. Kotapadu, Pendurthi, Sabbavaram, Kasimkota, Anandapuram and K.K. Agraharam areas. Last year, the local yield was exhausted by this time. This year, we have sufficient crop which will last till April. Once the local supply starts dipping, tomatoes will be sourced from Madanapalle, Kurnool and Bengaluru, says D. Raju, EO of Peda Waltair Rythu Bazaar.Cold storage facilityAlthough consumers are buying large quantities of tomatoes at present, department officials stress on the effective utilisation of cold storage facility to address wastage problem.Though we have two cold storage facilities in Gopalapatnam and MVP Colony Rythu Bazaars with a capacity of five metric tonnes each, most farmers prefer to sell the tomatoes at a nominal cost before they sign off for the day. If they utilise the facility available, it will help them fetch good price for tomotoes, observes T. Linga Murthy, EO of MVP Rythu Bazaar.According to Assistant Director of Horticulture Department K. Sailaja, tomato was grown in 1,085 hectares of area this year against 920 hectares last year. With one-third of farmers using organic farming methods, the tomato yield has gone up considerably, she says. For entrepreneurs who want to invest in the processing units to convert tomatoes into value-added products like jelly, puree, pickles and sauce, the Department of Horticulture is providing 35% credit linked back-ended subsidy which further enables optimum utilisation of the local crop."
5b149ad79855b72ada07d8b4,Why do farmers go marching?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/why-do-farmers-go-marching/article23351136.ece,2018-03-26,"Why are Indian farmers perpetually in revolt? The question has been raised by many after the recent farmers march to Mumbai and simmering rebellions across the States in recent years.No doubt, agriculture is one segment of the economy on which vote-conscious governments havent skimped on outlays. Over the years, Central governments have allocated ever-rising sums towards procurement, input subsidies and rural employment schemes, while States have periodically announced loan waivers.But that farmer protests have persisted, and even intensified, perhaps shows that many of these schemes arent addressing the right set of problems. The reasons for agricultural distress have changed quite dramatically in recent years.From shortage to plentyA few years ago, farmers seeking to register their protest used to do so beside wilted crops and parched farmlands.But in the last couple of years, farmers from Mandsaur to Salem have given vent to their angst by dumping vast quantities of unsold produce  tomatoes, grapes, onions and milk  on lakebeds and national highways.Historically, agricultural distress in India has been linked to truant monsoons, input shortages and lacklustre yields which frequently put growers on the road to penury.In recent years though, it is surplus output and unremunerative prices that have decimated farm incomes more often.Trends in Indias agricultural output over the last twenty years present an eye-opener to this problem of plenty.For an extended period from 1998-99 to 2009-10, Indias rice output stayed stuck at 85 million tonnes to 95 million tonnes, with drought years such as 2002 and 2004 seeing sharp downward blips.As consumption hovered at 80 to 90 million tonnes in this period, shortages were more frequent than surpluses.But after climbing to 105 million tonnes in 2011-12, Indias rice production has stayed well above the 100 million-tonne mark for the last six years, even scaling110 million tonnes in 2016-17. With offtake still stuck at about 90 million tonnes, theres been persisting excess stock in the market. As a result, in the last five years, wholesale prices of paddy have crept up at a 2.4% annual rate.The wheat story is similar. From a yearly average of about 75 million tonnes in the decade to 2010-11, wheat output leapfrogged to average 94 million tonnes in the last six years. Output, now at 97-98 million tonnes, is now neck-and-neck with domestic demand (about 100 million tonnes) and it may only be a matter of time before it overshoots it. With rising supplies, wholesale wheat prices have inched up at a 2% yearly rate in the last five years.Not too long ago, India was facing a severe shortage of pulses, with output struggling to keep up with the rising protein intake of the masses. But farmers have dramatically ramped up pulses production too. From an annual average of 14 million tonnes in the decade to 2010-11, it has averaged 18 lakh tonnes in the last six years. India harvested a record pulses crop of 23 million tonnes in 2017, matching the official demand estimate, thus dampening once-high market prices for a range of dals. This script of galloping surpluses dampening prices has played out in commercial crops such as sugarcane and tea too.If unremunerative prices have dogged other crops, fruit and vegetable farmers have been up against the high perishability of their produce. In the last fifteen years, India has doubled its potato output, trebled its tomato harvest and managed a fourfold increase in onion output. But poor storage facilities and State laws that keep farmers bound to their local mandis, have exposed farmers to wild swings in prices.Driving the outputIt is noteworthy that agricultural output has held up at relatively high levels in recent years, despite erratic monsoons. This could be because the droughts in 2014 and 2015 have been far less severe than those in 2009 or 2002.In 2014, a drought year, the country still harvested 105 million tonnes of rice, 86 million tonnes of wheat and 17 million tonnes of pulses. Hefty hikes in the Centres Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) have also had a big role to play in farmers ratcheting up output. In the last ten years, the support prices for wheat and paddy have risen 73% and 108% and those on pulses have trebled. In recent years, State governments have also competed furiously with the Centre, announcing bonuses and their own support prices for crops such as onions, tomatoes, potatoes and even green chillies.Illusory profitsIt is early days yet to say if recent improvements in Indias farm output are here to stay. But after responding enthusiastically to signals from MSPs for many years, farmers have lately found the mechanism failing them. Market prices for many crops have tended to plunge and stay below their official MSPs for extended periods.For one, though the Centre announces MSPs for 24 crops, the bulk of its procurement operations (via FCI) are restricted to just two  rice and wheat, with NAFED chipping in on pulses.State-level procurement operations are even more adhoc, lacking both direction and funding. Therefore, while a farmer may plant mustard, grapes or onions in any given year based on the MSP promise, theres really no guarantee that he will get that price when he visits the mandi.Two, even in crops where the Centre or State agencies are active, their market interventions tend to be too selective and sporadic to make any real difference to a majority of farmers. Despite the Centre doubling down on procurement in 2017-18, it will mop up only about a third of Indias rice and wheat output and a tenth of the pulses harvest. So, if good monsoons result in more crops moving into surplus zone, market forces will continue to prevail over MSPs.Three, given that the Centres market interventions on rice and wheat have proved so ineffectual despite large spends, it is unclear how the Centre or copycat States will fund MSPs in a host of other crops.New fixesTo be fair, the NDA has been trying out new policy fixes to address such problems. It is piloting price deficiency payments in place of MSPs to compensate farmers for price-related losses.It plans to replace input subsidies with direct cash transfers. It has kick-started a national electronic market for produce and is nudging States to repeal their APMC Acts, which prevent farmers from selling in markets of their choice.But its aggressive inflation-fighting efforts and on-off trade policies still work to the detriment of farmers. In the last couple of years, despite supply gluts, the Centre has continued with sizeable imports of wheat and pulses at low tariffs.Handling of spikesSeasonal spikes in prices of sugar, atta or rice are often met with export taxes, minimum export prices or even outright export bans.States, on their part, continue to be quite adamant about levying high taxes and hanging on to the draconian mandis, which force farmers to rely heavily on middlemen.This puts the Indian farmer in a Heads I win, tails you lose situation. If market prices of crops hit rock-bottom, the government is helpless to rescue them. But if prices soar, the government prevents them from making hay by clamping down.All this makes it clear why Indian farmers are seething. Its for the same reason that salaried employees are often unhappy. Who would like being rewarded peanuts, after being highly productive?"

On Wednesday (March 28), the price stood at Rs. 7.20. However, it jumped to Rs. 12.80 per kg on Thursday. Incidentally, the price has plummeted to Rs. 2 a kg and even below at several markets in southern States.Chairman of the Madanapalle tomato market committee R. Gurappa Naidu said since November, the price had not gone down below Rs. 5, which was a unique thing in the annals of the local market. The peak season would commence with April, with stocks of about 800 tonnes a day reaching the market, as against the current supply of around 200 tonnes, he said.ExportsWe are expecting large-scale exports from April 15, as Madanapalle market will alone remain stable thanks to congenial climate for tomato cultivation in the country. Generally, there will be a high demand for the Madanapalle varieties in the northern States from the start of summer in view of the long shelf life and taste. The demand will continue till July, he said."

Some airlines are embracing the idea of healthier flying, offering calorie-conscious menus and new exercise videos.According to Beth McGroarty, research director for The Global Wellness Institute, a non-profit organisation for the wellness industry, even as seats shrink and flights get more crowded, many carriers want air travel to be more bearable (and even enjoyable). They believe wellness is the way to do that. Its part of the larger wellness movement happening in the travel industry, she says.More democraticAnd, unlike the usual trend of ramping up onboard amenities for only their first- and business-class customers and stripping them away for passengers in economy, Ms. McGroarty says that no passengers are left out in this recent wellness push. Wellness in the air, in many instances, is more democratic.All customers on United Airlines and JetBlue have access to the popular digital meditation service Headspace as a part of their in-flight entertainment. JetBlues Headspace content includes videos that address travel topics such as fear of flying and difficulty sleeping upright.Among international carriers, Swiss Air offers Headspace onboard long-haul flights, and British Airways has a Well Being channel on its in-flight entertainment systems that includes meditation and stretching exercises. Hong Kong-based carrier Cathay Pacific recently launched six in-flight videos, called Travel Well With Yoga, in a partnership with Pure Yoga, the popular yoga studio chain. Videos are between five and 20 minutes, and feature yoga and meditation exercises such as hip and back stretches and deep breathing.Passenger surveysAmerican Airlines started prioritising wellness after conducting customer surveys and running focus groups with fliers about what they want. We learned that our passengers care a lot about their well-being, says Nick Richards, the companys director of customer experience.According to Americans research, travellers wanted to sleep more soundly in the skies, and to that end, the airline recently tapped mattress and bedding brand Casper to design pillows, blankets and other products that are supposed to help with a more comfortable sleep. Premium economy passengers receive a lumbar pillow and a soft cotton blanket while the Casper amenities for international first- and business-class passengers include mattress pads, pillows, blankets and pyjamas.Tucking inMental well-being and sleep aside, airlines are also incorporating wellness onboard by offering healthier food and drink options.Turkish Airlines, for instance, has a new Fly Good Feel Good campaign that includes a menu of herbal teas such as one with rooibos, sage and lavender to help relieve stress and promote sleep. Another is an energising blend with mate, mint and ginger. Children are offered a traditional Turkish drink with milk, carob powder and date syrup thats meant to strengthen the bones.In January, TAP Air Portugal tapped five Michelin-starred Portuguese chefs to create low-calorie Portuguese-influenced entrees for its business-class passengers. Those entrees will also be offered to economy passengers starting this summer, says Joel Fragata, head of the airlines in-flight products.Jos Avillez, of the two Michelin-starred Lisbon restaurant Belcanto, crafted a stone bass in tomato and onion stew, along with coriander and basil potatoes for TAPs flyers while Henrique S Pessoa, of the Michelin-starred Alma, also in Lisbon, came up with a lemongrass and ginger chicken curry.A handful of domestic, American carriers, too, are encouraging mindful eating. Dr. Charles Platkin, a nutrition and public health advocate, and the director of the Hunter College NYC Food Policy Center, conducts an annual airline food study where he analyses the economy food of every domestic carrier.NY Times"

(File) Mandeep Singh, a vegetable trader at the same market, said the retail consumer is sure to be hit hard. (File)At the largest vegetable market of Jalandhar, Maqsudan mandi, tomato was being sold at Rs 40-70 per crate, which has 20 kgs, as per wholesale price. The same crate on Friday sold for Rs 300 more, almost a five-time high in a day. Similarly, the wholesale price of Shimla Mirch (capsicum) was Rs 50 for 15 kgs on Thursday. On Friday, it was being sold for Rs 225 per 15 kgs, again a five-time hike.A similar hike was seen in the prices of several vegetables because of the 10-day nationwide agitation by farmers that started Friday. During this period, farmers have announced to go on leave and will not supply vegetables and milk in cities. In Punjab, three out of 11 farmers organisations are supporting the stir. One can well imagine what would be the picture in the coming 10 days, said Rohit Sharma, a vegetable trader at Maqsudan.Mandeep Singh, another vegetable trader at the same market, said the retail consumer is sure to be hit hard.A retailer from vegetable market at Partap Bagh area said, Because of the transportation charges in carrying vegetables from wholesale to retail markets, our margins are high.Subhash, who owns a vegetable shop in Mai Hiran Gate area, echoes his view. Meanwhile, several farmers were seen moving on tractors in the city today and stopping others farmers not supporting the agitation from supplying vegetables and milk to city areas. The protesting farmers also created a ruckus at Maqsudan mandi by throwing away vegetables bough by traders from farmers in bulk.

(Express Photo by Sahil Walia) Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar. (Express Photo by Sahil Walia)Opposition Congress and INLD on Sunday launched a scathing attack on the Khattar led BJP government alleging every section was fed up with its misrule.In separate news conferences here, Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda and INLDs Abhay Singh Chautala targeted the state government over a host of issues including those on farmers, employees, youth and players. Hooda said Manohar Lal Khattar governments Bhavantar Bharpayee Yojana, launched to protect the growers in the event of crash in prices, had failed to yield results. He said recently farmers at many places had been forced to throw their tomato crops on roads or give them to the Gaushalas.The government did not come to the rescue of tomato farmers when prices crashed. They have not got any benefit under this Yojana, the former chief minister claimed. On the players issue, he said: The government first cancelled the awards ceremony and afterwards has been coming out with contradictory statements regarding honouring them. They are not clear which policy they have to follow and players are being disrespected. He was also asked about the state government suspending Haryana Staff Selection Commission chairman B B Bharti after a row over an objectionable question pertaining to Brahmins, in an examination conducted by the board.Hooda said there was no provision to suspend HSSC chairman and the government should either dismiss him or ask him to resign. He said, moreover, the state government too should be held equally responsible as it was not a mere mistake in a question paper but an insult to the entire Brahmin community. Hooda also asked the government to immediately resolve the issue of ongoing strike by the sanitation workers. While this government keeps talking so much about Swachh Bharat and Swachh Haryana, it is making no efforts to end the 10-day old strike which has resulted in heaps of garbage being piled up and inconvenienced the citizens he stated.Meanwhile, INLDs senior leader Abhay Singh Chatuala, while addressing another news conference, demanded the Khattar government issue a white paper on the five foreign trips undertaken by the Chief Minister and those part of his entourage on different occasions giving full details. Chautala said that while the government has claimed that investments worth over Rs 7 lakh crore had fructified as a result of MoUs signed with various governments and other agencies during these trips, the white paper should detail how much revenue has actually been garnered out of these investments.Chautala, who is Leader of Opposition in the State Assembly, also said that the Chief Minister had claimed that lot of wasteful expenditure has been incurred as part of hospitality expenses during Hoodas tenure. ..then it is the responsibility of the present government to tell what steps are being taken to reclaim that money, he added. However, while reacting to this, Hooda said, if people come to meet the Chief Minister (during his time), it is his responsibility to offer them a cup of tea and snacks. But everyone knows that nobody comes to meet him (Khattar). If they have their way, the present government would even set up a Commission of Inquiry to go into how much tea and biscuits had been consumed on the hospitality that was extended. On criticism by Hooda to INLD-BSPs ongoing Jail Bharo Andolan on SYL canal issue, and his dubbing it as Bus Bharo Andolan, Chautala said,those coming from five star culture will not understand our agitation.Our leaders and workers have been courting arrest and authorities let us off in the evening saying they do not have any place to keep us in jails. Hooda had said that INLDs Jail Bharo Andolan on SYL was limited to getting on to the buses, courting arrest and getting released in the evening. Had they been serious, they would have actually gone to jail on this issue, Hooda said.On the developments in Karnataka, both Hooda and Chautala said B S Yedurappas resignation had thoroughly exposed the BJP, which allegedly wanted to encourage horse trading despite knowing they did not have numbers on their side to cobble up a majority.Replying to another question, Chautala said Mayawati-led third front will come into existence and the BSP supremo will be the countrys next prime minister after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
