A sum of Rs. .9.64 lakh was provided for the purpose.Five self-help groups (SHGs), including three womens groups, have been constituted under the project and each group consists of 10 to 14 members. All expenses  including the rent of land, seeds, organic manure, pump sets for irrigation, agricultural implements, and wages  were borne by the department.Our produce is in good demand among the consumers as our farming methods are transparent and can be viewed by anyone, says A. Kavalan, tribal cheftain, Kavadam Paniya settlement, and president of the Surya SHG.Lower pricesThough organic produce are priced at a premium, the SHGs sell vegetables at rates less than the market price. Earlier, the members used to sell their produce to middlemen. Later, they made a tie-up with Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) to avoid middlemen and to get a better income, says A. Manojkumar, committed social worker of the Department said.We have sold nearly one tonne of yard-long beans through Kudumbasree at Rs. 22 a kg .The harvest of other vegetables will start soon, K. Meenakshi, president of the Arya SHG, said.While vegetable traders in nearby towns sell vegetable procured from Gundlupet in Karnataka at a higher price, we are able to sell pesticide-free produce at 20% to 25% lower than the market rate, she said.We expect a profit of Rs. 15 lakh from he project this season, says N.J. Reji, tribal extension officer, Kaniyampetta grama panchayat.We were able to provide 60 working days to 64 families in the past two months and the profit from the project will be utilised as a revolving fund to expand vegetable cultivation to ensure a sustainable income to tribal members, he said."

Ltd. is on a mission to regain market share for its flagship Complan brand even as it looks to add more categories, according to a top official.The Indian arm of the Nasdaq-listed food and beverage firm, The Kraft Heinz Company, also owns brands such as Nycil talcum powder, Heinz tomato ketchup, and Sampriti ghee in the Indian market.There are multiple categories in the pipeline as part of our long-term strategy. Our efforts are now focussed on consolidating our position and market share in Complan, said HIPL managing director Sankalp Potbhare in an interaction, declining to comment on future product line-ups.In India, Complan is a 50-year-old brand, offering milk-based nutrition beverage. It was learnt that Complans market share had slipped to single digit for various reasons over the last few years.Bulk of HIPLs (also known as Kraft Heinz) Indian revenues are from Glucon-D (more than 40%), followed by more than 30% from Complan. The rest are from other segments.Mr. Potbhare said that the companys Rs. 6,000-crore milk food drink (MFD) segment comprised brands like Horlicks and Boost, Bournvita and Complan besides some local brands. Tamil Nadu and West Bengal together accounted for 30% of HIPLs MFD market.Changed formulationsSince our re-launch in August 2017, with changed formulations, we have gained in market share. We are looking at a double-digit market share nationally, said Mr. Potbhare, who was here to unveil a campaign with cricketer Sourav Ganguly, whom the company recently signed up as brand ambassador for three years.He was our choice as a legendary sportsperson and as a doting father, he said. The current campaign aims to raise protein awareness across India starting with West Bengal.We are looking at volume growth and market gains, since that makes the business sustainable, Mr. Potbhare said."
5b1538339855b76a5f1a07a0,Fruit of labour eludes farmers,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/fruit-of-labour-eludes-farmers/article23790028.ece,2018-05-06,,The Hindu,"Vegetable prices have remained nearly constant for the past decade at Rythu Bazaars, data sourced from Rythu Bazaar website shows. Except for a brief bump in 2017 when tomato prices touched Rs. 85 during summer, the prices have fluctuated in a narrow band of Rs. 6 and Rs. 20, occasionally going up to Rs. 30. What this means for farm income can be easily guessed.Vegetable prices, even for a perishable item like tomatoes, are a product of demand and supply. When both are nearly constant, the price will remain constant. The produce that reaches Hyderabad is not just local. Farmers from far flung districts like Madanapalle, Vizag and Chittoor also get their produce here. That benefits the consumers who pay between Rs. 10 and Rs. 14 per kilo for tomatoes, says B. Babu, Deputy Director, Horticulture Department, Rangareddy.At the Rythu Bazaar in Mehdipatnam, the buzz begins early in the morning with farmers bringing their produce in wicker baskets or neatly packed in colourful plastic tubs. At around 9 a.m., the estate officer goes and with a piece of chalk, marks the prices on the green signboard. It sets off a noisy cacophony as the farmers and traders begin an earnest conversation. As the shoppers troop in, it is business time as the farmers disappear and the traders take charge. I have been bringing my vegetables from Chevella for the past five years. I dont remember getting more than Rs. 10 per kilo for tomatoes. Sometimes, I have sold by number of baskets without being aware of the number of kilos, says Bharat Reddy, who cultivates tomatoes on his one-acre patch.Farm labourThe near-flat vegetable prices have had their impact on farm labour as well, as can been seen from a recent Reserve Bank of India paper Rural Wage Dynamics in India: What Role does Inflation Play? It used farm and non-farm wages as a take off point: There has been a sustained sluggishness in rural wage growth in the more recent period (post 2012-13), with the fall in agricultural wage growth being higher than non-agricultural wages.For agriculture produce, even the cost is not being covered. Last year, there was big buzz about chilli prices. Indias contribution to the world chilli production is 37% with the two Telugu states contributing 57%. The output per acre has remained constant and the sale price has also remained constant for most vegetables aggravating farm sector distress, says Sarampally Malla Reddy of All India Kisan Sabha.Wholesale prices are being dictated by six big corporates who are able to control the price as they are the main canalising agencies for both import and export of agricultural produce, says Mr. Reddy.The low prices has also meant that the farmers are being left to their own devices as they can no longer afford to purchase inputs required to raise farm output. Tomato seeds cost Rs. 1 lakh per kilo. Farmers who cannot afford these are using old seeds for growing their crops. This is further lowering the yield. While the farm inputs have kept pace with inflation rising steadily, the price that the farmers are getting has not. This is leading to farm distress, reducing farmers to subsistence level, says Narasimha Reddy Donthi, an agriculture policy expert."

With the fishing ban in place, you can find them clinging to the boats as well now.Fishermen like Gurumoorthi, 30, who are good at diving, make some extra money using their skills to remain under water for extended periods.There are different kinds of mussels and all of them taste great if you use some chicken masala for cooking. The cleaning takes some skill. If it is not done properly, you will end up with a stomach ache, he said, shivering due to the cold water. Mr. Gurumoorthi cooks mussels and also scrapes them from their hiding places. Pressure cook them for a whistle and they will open up. Retain only the soft flesh, make some masala with tomatoes, onion, turmeric powder, garlic and ginger and add the flesh to it, he explained.Oxygen tanksA 50 kg bag of mussels is sold to exporters and hoteliers for Rs. 6,500, for which he and his father Devarajan, 57, spend a few hours in the water. If someone wants just a few, we dont use oxygen tanks and other equipment. But if it is going to be a bagful, then we take enough precautions, explained Mr. Devarajan. However, since there is no regulation and anyone who can dive can get the mussels, there are divers from Thoothukudi who come here on a regular basis and scrap whatever they can, leaving almost nothing for local divers.M.D. Dayalan of the Indian Fishermen Association said that if the Chennai Port Trust permits, mussels can be grown in the fishing harbour using coir ropes and cotton cloth.It would be a good livelihood option for fishermen, at least those who depend on traditional craft. Already mussels are grown in backwaters and in estuaries, he pointed out.There are different kinds of mussels and all of them taste great if you use some chicken masala for cooking"

It is apparent that the Governor has acted in a partisan manner over the issue, he alleged.He said that the disregard has been shown to the mandate of the people by denying opportunity to Janata Dal(Secular)-Congress coalition to form the government though it has required numbers.When protesters threw tomatoes at BJP office, the police arrested them. Cases under section 71 of The Karnataka Police Act, 1963 have been booked against the arrested.Meanwhile, the functionaries of Shivamogga District Congress Committee(SDCC) took out a protest march in the city to express ire against allowing Mr. Yeddyurappa to take oath as Chief Minister."

Most of the villages in these mandals are rainfed and farmers are forced to depend on irrigation water sources.The State government sanctioned NTR Jalasiri Phase II programme in the financial year 2016-17 for small and marginal farmers where additional groundwater recharge is available. The programme essentially focusses on utilisation of available groundwater resources and to promote conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater duly adhering to the norms mentioned under the A.P. Water, Land and Trees Act-2002.Mallisala village of Jaggampeta mandal is rainfed and in upland areas and dependent on the irrigation water tanks with meagre irrigation water sources. Only sago, mango and cashew is grown by farmers in this region. All the wage seekers in the village are developing the natural resources, hereby increasing their standard of living with the wages earned through NREGS.Success storiesTirri Ramu, a 60-year-old farmer in Mallisala, with a land holding of three acres, mostly depends on seasonal rain, and grows mango and cashew. He dug a borewell and connected a solar pump to it at a cost of Rs. 25,000 against the original price of Rs. 4.5 lakh. He has grown about 250 mango plants, cashew and tomato as intercrop for the past two years. His income incresaed from Rs. 30, 000 to Rs. 80, 000 per annum.Farmers of Korukonda are another example of the success of NTR Jalasiri programme where the yield from paddy has almost doubled.Surampudi Narasimha Murthy, a poor farmer having three acres of land, was getting only 10 to 15 bags per acre as the area is rainfed and also upland area. Project Director of District Water Management Authority (DWMA) G. Rajakumari said that when Mr. Murthy approached them, the authority offered solar-based borewell for Rs. 25,000 by giving a subsidy of Rs. 4.25 lakh.Field staff of DWMA and local NREGS installed borewell and solar panels in Mr. Murthys paddy field last year. This year, the yield has almost doubled to 30 bags. Last year, I got only 15 bags in my field and because of solar pumpset this year, I got 30 bags of paddy with which I am so happy, Mr. Murthy added."

Her mirchi ka salan, made with de-seeded large green chillies and cooked in a gravy of peanut, sesame, coconut, poppy seeds and ginger-garlic paste, made for a spicy yet creamy delicacy.Noor Khans lal mich qeema was a quick-selling dish. The founder of the home food festival, Khan, a vegetarian, said she developed the recipe 10 years ago as an experiment.Rashid Husain, the only male participant, brought to the festival his mothers mutton yakhni pulao.Beyond Awadhi food was the Bundeli Thali, consisting of a potato-tomato curry that had its own fan following. Set up by NGO Apni Rasoi of Chitrakoot, all work here is done by the women from the rural region. Usha, who was at the stall, said, Our sabzi uses very little oil and spices. Because of poverty in Bundelkhand, this has become the way of life. Our NGOs aim is to help women feel that their work of cooking can also earn them money, she said.Empowering women is actually the theme of the festival. None of our home cooks does this commercially. While some only take their cost, many do not even take that. All the money that comes in is used for our women leadership programmes, said Madhvi Kuckreja, the founder of the festival.Dhan sak to kebabs , a plateful of choicesFurther ahead was Farzana Shahabs aaloo gosht.

That means your food is finished, said Husain.With her origin in Gadhi, Manakpur, Asma Khan cooked pateeli ki tikiya in a deep earthen pot, resulting in succulent kebabs.At Shamims stall, galawat kebabs were being fried non-stop from the 10kg kebab batter she had got.Making a burst of colours was Madhu Wadhwas Punjabi Thali stall decorated with quirky items from her home.

The PMs irrigation schemes are helping farmers. We work to reform, perform and transform. We will solve every small problem you face, Modi said.The PM also said that farmers who grow vegetables and fruits like tomatoes, onions and potatoes (TOP) are the priority of the government. You all know how people used to wait in queues for urea, they even faced lathis. Urea is a portfolio handled by this citys son (H N Ananth Kumar). And therefore, there has been record production by farmers this time. The kind of sensitivity we have shown the farmers, has the Congress government ever shown that? Modi asked to a loud cheer Farmers from Mumbai-Karnataka region, who had hoped to hear Modi speak on Mahadayi, looked frustrated after the PM left. Moreover, as Modi touched upon irrigation schemes and farmers suicides, it was expected that he would refer to Mahadayi. However, most part of his address focused on attacking the Congress.Ahead of Modis rally, Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah on Sunday asked him to find time to resolve the Mahadayi issue with neighbouring Goa. Narendra Modi, I am glad you are making time to visit the countrys startup and innovation hub , Namma Bengaluru today. On behalf of my people, I urge you to find the time for Karnatakas drinking water needs and help us resolve the Mahadayi dispute #NammaKarnatakaFirst, the CM had tweeted.Welcome to Karnataka. You may be the son of Gujarat but you are PM of the entire country. I hope you will address the long-pending Mahadayi issue and intervene. This at least will bring some good news for the farmers of North Karnataka , JD(S) president H D Kumaraswamy had said.On January 25, various Kannada organizations and pro-farmer organizations had observed a Karnataka bandh , demanding the PMs intervention in the issue."

Spandana is in charge of social media outreach for the Congress.The BJP wasn't happy with her comment, assuming she was referring to a hallucinogenic plant.""Most people of the country and our party members won't even know what you are referring to (including PM himself) but your Leader will connect with it instantly. While you have insulted people of India with your atrocious comment, your leader will be proud of you!!"", said BJP leader GVL Narasimha Rao.The BJP's Amit Malviya , its IT maven, also tweeted about Spandana's comment. He wondered whether Congress president Rahul Gandhi would suspend her like he did senior leader Mani Shankar Aiyar. The Congress suspended Aiyar from the party for using the word ""neech"" in a comment aimed at PM Modi during the Gujarat Assembly polls.Malviya, though, didn't 'tag' Spandana on Twitter, and the latter wondered if it was because those who follow him on the microblogging site would see her videos about PM Modi.""You didn't want to tag me cos you didn't want people to watch the Modi video pinned on my timeline?"" she said.Spandana also wondered - a mite disingenuously - what all the fuss was about, saying ""POT"" merely meant ""Potato, Onion, Tomato"".""Come on! Be a sport- And hey, POT = Potato ?? Onion Tomato ?? what were you thinking? ??,"" she tweeted.The BJP was not mollified. Its IT wing head Malviya said more than 3,500 farmers have committed suicide in Karnataka, the highest for any state in India, but ""speaking for them is being on 'POT'... Congress keeps it classy, again"".PM Modi used the word acronym ""TOP"" when talking about the Union Budget 2018's 'Operation Green'.""Farmers producing fruits and vegetables are our 'TOP' priority.

The Gujarat government also sought information about the government of Indias recent budget announcement to provide an MSP of 1.5 times input cost, to include such a scheme in the state budget as well. After the partys near rout in rural areas in the 2017 assembly elections, the party has become sensitive to farmers issues. The Rupani government is planning a series of actions to address agrarian problems.A senior government officer privy to the development said, The state government has decided to adopt a new scheme for farmers to provide a reasonable MSP, as has been implemented in Madhya Pradesh and Telangana. The Madhya Pradesh government has a Bhavantar scheme for farmers, under which farmers get the difference between the market price and MSP directly in their account and they can sell directly at market price. So the government does not need to buy and store it as do today, in the case of groundnut. A lot of government resources will be saved on hiring godowns and using the produce later.The government is also considering a new scheme like in Telangana, where the government provides part of the input cost to farmers before sowing. The third option is a hybrid of the Madhya Pradesh and Telangana models, to suit Gujarats needs. The government is waiting for a response from GOI. In case of a delay from GOI, the state government has decided to opt for both the models. We have also contacted Niti Aayog, which is working on a new country-wide formula for MSP, the source added."

According to Patanjali officials, the first units of the 234-acre food park in non-SEZ area will be commissioned in July this year and the first of the three plants will become fully operational in December. Work on food park in SEZ area and a third plant of ayurvedic products in non-SEZ area will start very soon. The first unit will process oranges.After taking over the food park land, the company had announced it will provide direct jobs to 10,000 people when all the three plants become functional. The first plant is expected to generate direct employment for 2,000 by December, said Patanjali officials.TOI visited the food park on Wednesday to find machinery worth hundreds of crores kept in the non-SEZ food park. The basic frame of the first plant made up of PEB (pre-erected building) has been erected. Sheets will be fixed on this structure to create walls of the plant. About 80% of the civil work will be completed by June.Sunil Gupta, senior general manager of Patanjali, said that about 85% of the machinery has been procured. The remaining machinery will be purchased when we are about to commission the plant. A large percentage of this machinery has been imported, he told TOI. Gupta further said that the company was investing Rs1,200 crore in the non-SEZ food park. This includes civil work, machinery, land cost, etc, he added.According to the official, Patanjali will manufacture a large number of products in the food park for domestic market. They include fruit juice, Indian gooseberry (aonla) candy, murabba (pickle), digestive tablets, hops, wheat flour, biscuits, ayurvedic juices, jams, ketchups and sharbats, he told TOI.Commenting on the capacity of the plant, he said, We will use 800 tonne oranges a day, 600 tonne of Indian gooseberry and 400 tonne of other fruits and vegetables like tomato, mango, bottle gourd (lauki), bitter gourd (karela), etc, each.The plant will be zero waste factory. Fruits and vegetables will be utilized 100%. Value added products will be made from the waste and rest will be fed to the boiler. For example we will make cosmetics and green tea from orange peel. We will also manufacture orange oil. The pomace will be fed to the boiler, Gupta said.The plant will also have zero liquid discharge. We will recycle the whole water we use. Costly machinery has been purchased for this purpose, the senior GM further said. Bhoomipujan of the food park was performed in September 2016 and production was expected to start in six months.

The dairy is currently paying Rs 570 per kg fat. Rajkot Dairy has also reduced the price by Rs 40 per kg fat in last one month and is currently paying Rs 540.Sarhad Dairy chairman Valji Humbal said, We are only following GCMMFs steps in price reduction. On February 8, prices will be further cut, but we wont reduce immediately. We will see how much we can pay. Otherwise, we have to reduce Rs 10 per kg fat more.The dairy procures 5 lakh litre per day (LLPD) from 50,000 farmers while Kutch produces 10 LLPD. Rajkot Dairy procures 4.75 LLPD milk.This year, GCMMF had received 22% more milk in terms of volume compared to last year. A month ago, GCMMF warned all its 17 milk producers unions not to procure extra milk. As a result, dairies across the state stopped registering new members. Rajkot Dairy has put one-day off in rotation every week as far as milk procurement is concerned in each of its 14 talukas.Dhiru Gandhi, a milk producer from Rapar in Kutch, said The dairy has already capped milk procurement and is now reducing the price of fat continuously. We have no option but to sell the milk to dairy because it is a perishable commodity and we cant store it. Private players also exploit by giving us low prices.Though the problem of surplus milk crops up every winter, this time the situation is more acute because of the drastic fall in price of skimmed milk powder (SMP). The production cost of 1kg SMP is Rs 240 while the market price is Rs 150 to Rs 160, which is why private players have stopped buying milk.GCMMF managing director R S Sodhi said, Surplus milk is a problem but we are paying more to farmers compared to last year. We have reduced a small amount but some dairies have reduced more than that. Milk comes in huge quantity and to restrict inflow they might have chosen more reduction. We expect demand to rise in summer.Dr B B Savalia, assistant research scientist of cattle breading farm at Junagadh Agriculture University (JAU), said Milk production will come down by 30% in summer while demand will rise. Therefore, the present problem wont escalate. Its a temporary phenomenon."

However, economists expect that the central bank would move to a more hawkish stance from the current neutral stance in the wake of growth bottoming out.We continue to expect the RBI to persist with its slightly hawkish pause in its Wednesday policy, from February, to err on the side of caution. That said, falling onion prices, after tomatoes, support our call that inflation risks are overdone, said Indranil Sen Gupta, economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch . According to Gupta, the MPC will see through the coming jump in inflation, growth and credit in mid-2018 as they are driven by base effects.Even without the central bank raising rates, lenders cost of funds has inched up as deposits slowed down and credit grew at a one-year high. Several large lenders, including State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank have hiked their bulk deposit rates. Private lender Axis Bank has also hiked its marginal cost of lending rate ( MCLR ) following an increase in cost of funds.According to DBS Bank chief economist Taimur Baig, growth has largely bottomed out, but India has yet to benefit from the synchronised pickup in global demand. The combination of fiscal challenges and rising oil prices would make the RBIs policy path a tricky one this year, in our view. Given Indias high debt and fiscal deficit, it may not be prudent to be on the sideline until inflation pressure becomes excessively high which, in turn, means the balance of risk is beginning to shift toward eventual policy tightening, he said.One of the factors that strengthen the case for a more hawkish regime has been the Union Budget , which unveiled a wider than expected fiscal deficit for the next year. But economists feel that the slippage is not enough to warrant a move to higher interest rates.Nomura economist Sonal Varma said, While the Budget is a slight disappointment relative to our expectations, it is not a game-changer in either direction  positive or negative. We expect a prolonged pause on monetary policy, including at the upcoming February 7 meeting, although the RBI may flag upside risks to inflation. She added that Nomura is yet to assess the impact of the government decision to hike minimum support prices (MSPs) on inflation and monetary policy outlook. The government has promised to increase the MSPs for crops by 1.5 times in the Budget.Benchmark 10-year bond yields have risen more than 80 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) since July  the biggest move since the 2013 rupee crisis, due in large part to worries about a more hawkish RBI."

The actor-turned-politicians swipe came following Modis comment at a rally here, during which he said farmers were his top priority and described TOP as tomato, onion and potato. Is this what happens when youre on POT? she tweeted.Reacting to the pot jibe, chief minister Siddaramaiah said he is not aware of the tweet, but character assassination of any individual was not right.I have countered Modis allegations point-by-point against our government, but refrained from making any personal attack. He may be our political rival, but I will not speak disrespectfully of the PM personally. We are in a federal structure. We have accepted the Constitution. We have to run the government in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. We cant go against it. We are not the BJP to go against the Constitution, he said.Hitting out at Ramya, BJPs IT cell head Amit Malviya tweeted: In Karnataka, more than 3,500 farmers have committed suicide under @ siddaramaiahs watch, highest for any state in India but speaking for them is being on POT...Congress keeps it classy, again...And in another tweet: Will Rahul Gandhi maintain silence on Divya Spandanas comment while he sacked Mani Shankar Aiyar just because his jibe came close to Gujarat election and Karnataka is still some months away?

Farmers of some crops have sustained losses, and there was little that the government could do as it was difficult to have a regulatory policy for each and every crop, said the APMC.Vegetable supplies at the APMC wholesale market this winter has doubled. The daily supply is pegged at 70-80 tonnes comprising some 600 vehicles  a mix of trucks and tempos. The crop has been better in the last two years, said Shivaji Pahinkar, APMC Mumbai secretary. The APMC comes under the agriculture and marketing department of the state government. Farmers growing tomato, brinjal and leafy vegetables are reported to have sustained losses, said the APMC. The loss is also on account of flooding of the market with farm produce from neigbouring states and farmers having to sell the stock cheap in view of increased supplies.Broccoli is largely supplied from Karnataka, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. Wholesale prices have plummeted while retailers have pocketed the benefit. Pahinkar added, There is very little that the government can do to contain the crash while there is no mechanism to control the retail trade. This year, the overall crop production has been good in the country. Pahinkar reasoned that it was difficult for the government to intervene into each and every crop, and so the government could do little to contain the fall in price, but if there was a concerted step by all state governments then the supplies could be regulated. A micro level planning will also be required as in what to sow and when besides more food processing units to match demand and supply, he said."

There has been a delay in price drop this year because of the unseasonal rains in November-December 2017. The rains had damaged vegetables in the fields and it took some time for the supplies to normalize, he said.However, the predicted spell of unseasonal rain, hail and thunderstorm is a cause for worry.

This Valentines Day , we share the tales of togetherness from six such couples for whom neither the colour of their passports nor the flavour of their cuisine mattered as much as that overpowering, magical emotion called love.Over the years, many a foreign tourist has visited Vijay Kumars tattoo studio at Fort Kochi. But when Natalia from Russia walked in, on a lovely January evening last year, it was a never-before moment. She took away Vijay Kumar's heart and their love blossomed into marriage in November, last year!He describes that first meeting: Natalia visited my studio out of curiosity, not to get a tattoo done. But when we met, something magical happened. Her simplicity and soft-spoken nature struck me.For Natalia, who was working as a manager of a company in Russia, it was her first trip to India. I remember the day I met my husband, vividly. I was at the hotel near his studio for dinner. Seeing the sign board of the studio, I went in, and there he was, she says. The gentle, open minded and kind-hearted Vijay Kumar won her heart in no time. He also has a subtle sense of humour, which I liked very much, she fondly recalls.Natalia returned to Russia by January end, but the duo kept in touch. We used to call and text every day, during breaks and after her office time. I realised how she was perfect for me. I am a simple Fort Kochi man, not someone who leads an adipoli life full of alcohol and cigarettes. Natalia shares my views and understands me. When she said she was ready to marry me and settle down here, I knew it was truly special, Vijay Kumar says.Natalia came back again in July. In September, they registered their marriage and had the wedding ceremony in November. She makes great dosa, idly, tomato rice and other Indian dishes, he compliments Natalia. She adds, Its his mother who taught me to cook them. But I am yet to learn complicated dishes. A vegetarian, she names chilly gobi, chilly paneer and dal as her favourite foods.Does she miss Russia? Well, when I do, I can probably ask my husband to take me to Munnar, Natalia says. I am in touch with my family through internet and have asked them to make their next trip to Kerala. Once we save some money, Vijay and I would make our first trip to Russia together.Music composer Rahul Raj says it was love at first sight when he met Miriam Merkle from Germany for the first time. She had flown down to Kerala to study at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeethams Amritapuri campus in Kollam. It was her great love for Indian culture that made her take up this course. Rahul was a routine visitor at Amritapuri campus as part of his music assignments and he had seen her there once.She was my Orkut friend at that time and I was surprised when she sent a message  Rahul Chettaa, I have heard your compositions and they are very nice, says Rahul. Thus we became friends and fell in love later. We got married in May 2008, after five months of knowing each other. My mother was a little worried that I was marrying a western girl; she was doubtful if my non-Indian wife would be able to adopt our culture and systems. But they are now more like mother and daughter and Miriam is very fluent in Malayalam. She was very keen to understand our rituals including pujas that we perform at our houses. She is a homemaker but for me, she is a wonder woman who takes care of everything at home including my mothers health. Our daughter Akshainie Leiyas name is a blend of German and Indian cultures. For us, Valentines Day is another ordinary day. We love enjoying the ordinary days and celebrate our ordinary life which is the happiest thing for Miriam and me.Irina Antonova, 30, first connected with Paul Skaria on a social media platform in November 2010. They chatted generally on travelling, personal development and Russian history in which Paul took a lot of interest. They later lost touch and did not speak for years but the connection was reignited after Irina posted a photo from London in November 2013. Paul was working in that city then and they spent several days together and developed a strong bonding.In 2015, Paul invited her to his home in India where he introduced her to his parents and proposed to her. In July 2015, they registered their marriage in Kochi.Says Irina: I remember that day vividly because it was an unforgettable experience not only because I was the bride but also because I was getting married in another country. It was in a beautiful church not far from our home. Some traditions and customs were new but there were no major differences because we both belong to the Orthodox church. I was dressed in a white wedding gown which I brought from Moscow while Paul wore a black suit. Later, I changed to a sari and I felt like an oriental princess.The couple are now settled in Kochi. She adds: We communicate in English, so there is no language barrier between us. Of course, there are some differences but it is natural. Ive learned to respect other peoples views and opinions more and to understand the values of another culture, to think in new ways and to take new decisions. Ive started to understand myself and others better. Along with exploring a new culture I understood my own culture deeper.She remembers that on their first Valentines Day after marriage, Paul gifted her some awesome jewellery and she gave him a palette with their photos. But we have 365 days in a year when everyone gets a chance to say I love you to their beloved and family members.""Avithal Elias Lautman describes her love story as a very nerdy one. She jokes that all her life, she prayed for a chance to study in IIT but God laughed and sent her to an IIT outside India. So, it was when both she and Ronen Shmuel Lautman were students of the Israel Institute of Technology that they met at a Diwali party organised by Avithal, a jew from Kochi. He loved my channa masala and we kept bumping into each other since then. He even came for my thesis defence. He was always too shy to ask me out, even though it was obvious he liked me, she says.Before one New Year's Eve, Avithal mustered the courage to ask him out, encouraged by her best friend Sara. Luckily, he didn't have any plans. We went out for our first date on New Years Eve, and we talked the whole night. It was very romantic. I couldnt wait to see him again. We made plans to have dinner the next night, and the rest is history. They got married on October 5, 2015, and are settled in Haifa, Israel.She continues: We embraced each others cultural differences, including food and family traditions. It was easy for us as we wanted more or less the same things from life and shared ideas about money, food, lifestyle and religion. Our parents were more excited and welcoming than we thought. His family never ever made me feel uncomfortable because of who I was. And my mom was always understanding with Ronens PDA. Also we never made fun of each others culture, but we did fight over the space agencies. Also he started eating with hands and learning Malayalam. I have already taught him to say, ente bharya sundariya. And he taught me how to eat with chopsticks. We love each more because of the cultural differences.She adds: On Valentines Day, we usually avoid restaurants as it can get crowded. We do make special food that day. It is usually only the two of us and that might include walks on beaches and a really good dinner.We do tell every now and then how we appreciate each other for being there always and we do not wait for a special day to say I love you.They met first in Dhaka where Ganga Nimmy Jose Cheripuram was associated with a bank and looking for a renewable energy project for rural India through micro finance and Johannes Fischbeck was a manager in a German firm that provided energy solutions to the developing world.My first impression of Joe was not so romantic as he was very reserved. If somebody would have told me then that he would be the man I was going to marry, I would have ran away at that moment itself, says Ganga. He, however, was impressed with her socialising.The long car rides in the next three weeks changed the equations drastically. We talked about our personal lives and realised that though representing vastly different cultures, we had a lot of common views. Still, it was the shock of my life, when he, after a week, confessed me that he liked me. I turned him down but one more week later, I found myself liking him too.Soon it was time to part ways. Joe went to Tanzania for another project while Ganga returned to Kerala. Mails and skype followed, not all of it official.Three months later, they decided to get married. For Joe, it was a bit strange to marry a girl whom he knew for such a short period but getting married was the only way to be together. Luckily, it was not so difficult to convince my family, says Ganga.Six months after their first meeting, Joe came down to Kochi with his parents and best friend. The Germans were astonished to see the 500-strong crowd while the Indians thought it to be a modest wedding. Joe still complains about the 300 photographs for which he was forced to smile.Ganga joined him in Berlin and found that language was a major barrier. There were other barriers too. We are so different. Introvert to extrovert, writer to talker, reader to cook, musician to gardener, cycling to watching movies...We never share any hobbies. But then, we really compliment each other. We do all our holidays to household works together.Daughter Emma was born in India and they stayed on in Kochi. So Joe started working as a renewable energy consultant in Kochi and I started a small business that deals with landscaping and terrariums. We enjoyed every moment of our six years in Kochi with lots of fun and fellowship.She adds: When it is time for Emma to start schooling, we came back to Germany and settled here now. In Joe's words, I am living physically here and mentally in Kerala. I continue my business in Kochi and am very well updated on all happenings in Kerala."

The immediate fallout of the strike was felt in the retail vegetable markets of the capital where veggie prices witnessed a rising trend. Moreover, the mandi board has incurred a loss of about Rs 2.5 lakh.Secretary of the traders association of fruits and vegetables Rajendra Saini termed the auction of parking lots as illegal and said nowhere in Madhya Pradesh farmers and traders pay for parking. The strike will continue till the mandi administration withdraws its orders, he said. He alleged that henchmen of contractors also extort money in the name of parking fees.As no farmer turned up in the mandi with his produce, the vegetable rates have started climbing in the retail markets. Besides, rates of fruits have also gone up. Saini said, Tomato, which was priced at Rs 10 a kg in retail before the strike is now being sold at many markets at Rs 20 per kg. Green chillies prices have gone up to Rs 50 to Rs 60 a kg. As far as fruits are concerned, papaya is being sold for Rs 30 a kg, almost Rs 10 up from yesterdays price.Achche Miyan, a retailer in New Market, said: Rates of fruits and vegetables in the city are likely to go up further if the mandi strike continues. There was already a shortage of commodities on Thursday.Joint director of mandi Ritu Chouhan urged the traders to end their agitation. She said she has directed mandi secretary Vinay Pateria to resolve the issue. However, the traders meeting with Chouhan on Thursday afternoon did not yield any result and the strike is likely to continue on Friday as well."
5b16731b9855b76a5f1a5ebf,Bumper tomato crop leaves farmers in red,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bumper-tomato-crop-leaves-farmers-in-red/articleshow/62942078.cms,2018-02-16,,The Times Of India,"BHOPAL: A bumper tomato crop in Madhya Pradesh and ban on its export to Pakistan have sent prices plummeting in the state, putting farmers on the edge of a fresh crisis.The government, which is already scrambling to tackle the massive crop damage from unseasonal hailstorms, now faces a challenge that is not covered by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhans recent assurances to farmers.With tomato selling for a mere Rs 2-3/kg at many places, many farmers are forced to let their crop rot in the fields since the price doesnt even cover the cost of plucking and transportation. The administration, however, feels its not at crisis level because tomato is a multipleharvest crop.Mahendra Singh, the biggest tomato farmer in Kolaras of Shivpuri  one of the three districts that produce the crop  said: A crate carrying about 25-30kg of tomato is being sold for Rs 60 to Rs 75. This is too little. The cost of growing the crop is about Rs 3.5/kg per hectare of land, which is why farmers in Shivpuri, where the best quality tomatoes are produced, are incurring huge losses. Kolaras has assembly bypoll on February 24.Earlier,10,000-oddcrates of tomato used to be sent to Pakistan, said Singh. But the export has been stopped. Now we are sending only to Nepal, and that too only about 5% of what used to be sold in the past. The surplus tomato is now being sold at a throw away prices, he added.Another big tomato grower, B P Dhakad of Ratlam, told TOI, At the moment, tomato is being sold in Pakistan at Rs 100-150 because the Centre has stopped export. The shelf life of our tomato is 3 to 4 days and in this period the yield can be sent to Pakistan only, a country with huge consumption of the vegetable.There are reports from Khargone and Badwani of farmers destroying their yield in the farms itself. Things may worsen in other parts of the state, said Shivpuris Mahendra Singh Horticulture director Satyanand doesnt agree. Tomato is a multipleplucking crop and farmers sometime sell their yield at Rs 40 a kg. Had they been incurring losses, they would have stopped cultivating tomato, he said.About governments plan to establish food processing units to utilise the yield, he said, We are still hopeful. But it is a risky business. Investors are scared that farmers may shift to other crops. Food processing plants are yield specific. A plant installed for tomato cannot process any other vegetable."

Last month, the price of the vegetable was around Rs 30  35 per kg. Traders at the Gandhi market in the city stated that the fall in price was mainly owing to the increase in supply and lower demand.At a time when selling one bundle of cabbage itself is a big task and we are provided with two or three more bundles, it is only obvious that we have to decrease the price to sell them off, said R Loganathan , who works at a vegetable shop at Gandhi Market.Cabbages mostly come from Bengaluru and the supply has increased significantly over the last few weeks, he added. We dont sell the unsold cabbages the next day, so it is absolutely crucial that we reduce the price so that we dont incur losses, he added.Other reasons for the fall in prices of vegetables are the cultivation trends of farmers and increase in number of markets in the city, claim a few traders.M Thangamani, manager at V S Karuppaiah vegetable shop at Gandhi market, said that many farmers cultivate a particular crop which would be highly priced at that point of time. Take tomato for example, if the price of the vegetable is high, every farmer starts to cultivate it, which eventually results in bigger supply and lower price, he said.Several traders had also predicted that the price of cabbage would increase again in a couple of weeks. It is not the case only with cabbage  any vegetable which is sold at a steep price would have a drastic fall in the following month. Its a cycle, Loganathan said, adding, For instance, coriander, which was sold for only Rs 5-6 per kg last month, is now being sold at Rs 15-16 a kg."

He also listed the health benefits of neera and added that food safety and profitable sector in neera should be established.Agricultural production commissioner and principal secretary to government, Gagandeep Bedi in his address said that small and medium farmers having adjacent lands can join together and collectively practice cooperative farming where provisions are available for the purchase of agricultural inputs at subsidised prices, he said.Around 2000 Farmer Producer Company has been established across the state. A processing unit will be established in Trichy district as well for processing and value addition of small onions, he added. Mathiyalagan, Join Director of agriculture delivered the vote of thanks."

When the price dropped to Rs. 3 a kilogram for tomato, farmers had left the crop unplucked. Some of them dumped heaps of ripe tomatoes by the road when they failed to get a price that would at least cover the labour cost.Kerala is the main market for the crop produced in the border villages. In the main vegetable market at Udumalpet in Tamil Nadu, farmers had to sell a 14-kg box of tomatoes for Rs. 20. The cost of plucking 14 kg alone is estimated at Rs. 10. Hence they find plucking the crop pointless.Rs. 20 in IdukkiThe same crop is charged Rs. 10 to 15 at the market at Marayur, in Idukki district, nearly 40 km from Udumalpet. In other areas of Idukki, the price is Rs. 20 or above.Market sources said tomato prices nosedived following a bumper production on the border villages, facilitated by the use of high quality seeds and a favourable climate there. They cultivated varieties such as 5005, US1, and US3. The demand for tomatoes in Kerala has not dwindled, but it is not high enough to absorb this added production. Last year, the price was almost 30% higher at the time of harvest.Boxes of tomatoes are left unsold at the Udumalpet market, which, along with Ottanchatram and Pollachi, is the main vegetable market near the border in Tamil Nadu. At Uralpatti, Edayamuthur, and Kannamanaickanur, tonnes of ripe tomatoes were found unplucked on the farms. The crop is mostly cultivated at Gudimangalam, Pethappampatti, Pollavadi, and Kurichikottai villages of Tirupur and Kumaralingam and Palani valleys of Tamil Nadu from October to January. In 45 days, it will yield fruit. In the cool-season vegetable producing villages of Kanthallur and Vattavada in Kerala, tomato is not cultivated now. It was cultivated earlier, but with poor availability of water and change in climatic conditions, farmers slowly shifted to other vegetables, said a farmer at Kanthallur."

Their own fields were their labs, as they put into practice what they gleaned from their textbooks.Some of the budding agriculturalists not only tweaked farming practices in their fields, but also helped transform their villages.In Kolar, farmers tend to grow lots of tomato. Between 2012 and 2014, we suffered losses and could not even meet the cost of cultivation, said Udaykumar K.S., who hails from Mallasandra in Kolar district, and earned an M.Sc. in agricultural economics.He convinced his parents to incorporate an integrated farming system. Now we grow potatoes, tomatoes, and cauliflower based on the season, and we are able to make a profit, he said.This prompted several other farmers in his village to follow their footsteps.

Two of my siblings are engineers. My father is proud that I have chosen this subject. As I come from a family of farmers, I got hands-on experience and observed the different practices adopted on our land, she said.It was not easy for all students to convince their families, steeped in age-old farming practices, to experiment.Yashika M.P. from Bellumadu, near Virajpet in Kodagu district, earned an M.Sc. in sericulture and bagged three gold medals. Over the past year, she has been trying to promote organic farming back home. It took a lot of convincing, as organic farming is a slow process. It will take another two years to see the results, but I am optimistic, she said.H.B.

Maybe this is because there are quite a few things that Ive refused to put in my mouth. Over the years its become a perverse fascination of mine to see what other people hate to eat. Perhaps this started when, as a kid, I developed a deep disgust for ghee  not a good aberration in a child with a Gujarati Vaishnav background. Well into adulthood I would recoil at any sight of ghee, whether it was being put in diyas for puja, spread on thin Gujju rotis or some mother/aunt-type culinary sergeant was attempting to sully my precious aamras with a drizzle of this melted hell-produce. My mom was unmoved and caustically pointed out the sheer idiocy of my attempting a ghee-mukt diet: You lovemagas(a typical Gujarati sweet) and it is full of ghee! Or: You love your Punjabi food and a lot of it is made with ghee! (A really sore point for her was not that I liked Punjabi vegetarian grub but that I ranked it on par with Gujju food.) My point was, as long as I couldnt see it, it was fine, but the visuals were intolerable, setting off a chain of retching in my throat.Food phobiasI was a weird kid. I hated ghee, rice andbaingan, but I lovedkarelaand the umami of vaal ni daal . Of my two sons, the older one decided at the advanced age of three to keep his fathers perversity but not for the same food. For the longest time I couldnt put any tomato-based product in front of him, namely, anything in which you could discern the offending red fruit. Would he eat pizza? Ye-es. Not as enthusiastically as other kids but he would eat it. Pasta sauce with tomato elements? Yes, as long as it was paste. Tomato salad? No way. Ketchup? No, wed have violence if there was any on the table.Then there is a friend of mine, S, a Gujju and a food lover from the same background as mine, for whom the kryptonite effect comes from just seeing coriander. Again, this is extreme cultural treason from a Gujju, but there it is. Forget about actual cilantro, we friends can torture him simply by posting photos of the green stuff on his Facebook page. How can a Gujju not love kothmir ? people ask him. S just smiles and says: But I love fish like a Bengali! At one point, S explained to me with the aid of a scientific website how the leaf actually sets off a semi-allergic reaction in him. Again, if he cant see it or smell it, hes fine. So no chopped coriander on his dhoklas, but if I use it as part of a paste in a daal hell eat it happily.Speaking of cultural traitors, people who know Im into food often ask me about the fact that I wont eat anything that has had any activity in water. People who dont know me well often ask: What kind of a Bengali doesnt love fish? My answer is simple: Im not a Bengali. I may have sloughed off my strict vegetarian upbringing, I may revel in eating all sorts of meat (yes, that kind and also that other kind), but this Pesciphobia is perhaps a remaining trace of my core childhood. Next question: How can you be a foodie and not explore seafood? A shifty Lefty once said: Im not a Marxist but Im a student of Marx. My reply goes: Im not a foodie but a spectator of foodie-ism. Which, of course, brings me to my Bong foodie friend who also doesnt much like fish. This friend, N, has even made a long documentary about Bengalis and fish, and he will lecture you knowledgeably about all the thousand varieties of fish available in the delta and how Bengalis of different persuasion (Ghoti or Bangal) like to cook them, but he will rarely touch the slippery suspects himself.Phobias shiftThe thing Ive noticed about these phobias is that they shift. Today, Son No. 1 is a reasonably good cook and he even uses tomatoes sometimes, though you can still get him to comply to demands by waving a bottle of ketchup. N is gradually beginning to include fish in his cooking repertoire, even though he himself barely eats it. Another friend, who used to find European cheese difficult to comprehend, is now, under direct pressure from a romantic and emotional direction, starting to discuss the joys of chvre, brie, pecorino and manchego. The other day, I found myself at a new restaurant trying and really liking some beautifully cooked crustaceans, lobsterish white pulp, glittering black eggs and all. Well before that, I discovered the joys of proper, naked ghee, the nice one my local milk-wala makes, the beautifully fragrant variety you get from Mysore, and even the superb organic one produced at a farm in Suffolk that costs 10 for a small jar. As N has demonstrated to me, decent ghee is central to a first course in Bong food, mixed with plain, hot rice plus some crisp, bitter element such as karela , thus creating a dtente between what Ive always loved and till recently hated. Does this mean I foresee S soon relishing a crown of coriander on a ceviche? No, that may take some time, but S has promised that the day a certain other pair of Gujaratis are forced to loosen their grip on power, he will eat something with a garnish of kothmir."

LakshmiNarayananThe fall in prices of vegetables both in the uzhavar santhai and in the open markets during the current marriage season has come as a pleasant surprise for consumers.The district has 11 uzhavar santhai, and major vegetable markets in Thalaivasal, Vazhappadi, Attur, and Mecheri. The price of vegetables in wholesale markets, and uzhavar santhai are fixed based on the arrival of stock and the prevailing demand.The price of vegetables has been coming down in the last few weeks.Normally, the prices go up during marriage season, and other festival days.The price of small onion has fallen from Rs. 180 a kg in December last to about Rs. 24 in uzhavar santhai on Monday.The price of tomato stood at Rs. 7 a kg; brinjal about Rs. 14; ladys finger Rs. 24; potato Rs. 20; snake gourd Rs. 10; broad beans Rs. 14; cluster beans Rs. 20; bitter gourd Rs. 16; green chilli Rs. 16; Bellary onion Rs. 27; cabbage Rs. 12; carrot Rs. 30; and radish Rs. 6.The price of coconuts, however, has gone up.Many consumers said that low price of vegetables will help those belonging to the weaker sections of society while conducting marriages.The farmers at Suramangalam uzhavar santhai said that the district experienced widespread rainfall by the end of last year, following which farmers had raised vegetables in a larger area. There was a spurt in vegetable production in the villages due to the availability of adequate water. The bulk arrival of all sorts of vegetables in the markets has brought down their price.The bulk arrival is expected to continue for a few more weeks, they said."

I can smell mustard oil and asafoetida, and know that some delicious Kashmiri dish is being cooked by our Kashmiri neighbours.Its a cuisine thats always been close to my heart. I like both Kashmiri Muslim and Hindu food, but I think I enjoy the latter even more than the former. The two kinds of regional food are similar  but also vastly different.I remember how thrilled I was when Chor Bizarre first opened up in Delhi in Asaf Ali Road eons ago. Since then, of course, several Kashmiri outlets  many of them catering units  have sprung up in the city. And Dilliwallahs are getting to know their gushtaba from their rista, and their nadru from their knol-knol.And, increasingly, we are discovering the differences between Pandit and Muslim food, too. What gives Kashmiri food its distinctive taste is the tempering in mustard oil of asafoetida and dried ginger, and the use of yoghurt and turmeric. Unlike the Muslim food, there is no garlic in the dishes.I had a great Kashmir Pandit meal some evenings ago at The Holiday Inn in Mayur Vihar. The coffee shop there  called Caf on 3  had a special Kashmiri food festival, organised by Rajni Jinsi, who I discovered is a great cook. The festival is over, but Jinsi runs her own outfit called Rajnis Kitchen (Ph Nos: 9899008238 and 9911469649).It was a stupendous meal  and I tried out many of the special dishes of the region, from kabargah (double-cooked lamb rack), fried fish, fried lotus stem patties to roganjosh, gosht yakhni and veth chaman, which is a dish of cottage cheese cooked with Kashmiri red chillies.What I really loved about the food was that they were all mildly spiced, yet each dish had its own characteristic taste.Contrary to popular belief, Kashmir food is not always rich. The moong dal that I had, for instance, was delightfully light and delicious. The dal had been cooked in some milk with pieces of radish, which added their own sharp taste to it.The yakhni, in yoghurt gravy, was smooth, and the Kashmiri chilli-red roganjosh was as pleasing to the eye, as to the palate. I use a lot of Kashmiri red chillies, for they add colour and a certain taste to a dish, but are not red hot. The KP roganjosh relies heavily on hing and does not use garlic, onions or tomatoes. Jinsis roganjosh was cooked with some yoghurt, dried ginger powder, fennel powder and some garam masala.I had thought I would stay away from the vegetables, but my young friend, Chef Suprabhath Roy Chowdhury (F&B director of the hotel), urged me to try out the schochal wangan  eggplant and Kashmiri haak  and I am happy he did. Tempered with dried ginger, some cloves and with the taste of tamarind in it, it was simply out of this world. What was equally delicious was the sweet rice  modur polav  which surprisingly really went well with the meat dishes.Another great aspect of Kashmiri food is the array of chutneys that come with it. There is a sharp radish chutney, a crunchy walnut one and fragrant one prepared with mint leaves.Rajnis Kitchen can cater for 15 people or so. I think she is one of the best cooks I have met in a while, and I hope the Kitchen does roaring business. Let the fires keep burning!"

With the commencement of the harvest period, the markets and godowns at Thammampatti have been receiving bulk stock of tomatoes daily.Due to the abundant availability of tomatoes, the price has nosedived for the past few weeks. The price has also gone down due to competition between people running the godowns.The price of tomatoes remained at Rs. 130 per bag containing 28 kg at Thammampatti. The price is Rs. 200 in Thalaivasal and Rs. 160 in the neighbouring Tiruchi district. As the farmers will be incurring additional expenses for transporting the harvested tomatoes to the markets and godowns, they have decided to convert the tomatoes into seeds for the next season.S. Mani, a farmer of Thammampatti, said that he spent Rs. 1,800 for the nursery for half acre land, after incurring heavy expenditure for ploughing the land, administering manure and removing the weeds.They have to pay Rs. 100 as wages for each worker for plucking 100 kg of tomatoes. They are not getting even the wages they pay to the workers from marketing the crop at present. As we will be incurring only additional expenditure by transporting the crop to the markets, we have decided to store them as seeds for next season.People involved in marketing tomato seedlings collect them in bulk from the farmers and market them to the needy farmers of other parts of the district. We are getting a little more revenue by marketing the seedlings then by selling the tomatoes, Mani says.The price of tomatoes has also fallen in the other production centres such as Mecheri and Muthunaikenpatti in the district.The price has been constantly remaining between Rs. 6 and Rs. 8 in the uzhavar santhais and other markets in the district."

MEP is the minimum price below which exporters cant export onions.The step would help in arresting crash in wholesale onion prices, which has a detrimental effect on the prices that farmers get from selling their product. The notification issued by the director general of foreign trade of Union ministry of commerce, Alok Vardhan Chaturvedi , said that MEP on all varieties of onions stands removed and can be exported without MEP.A copy of the notification is in possession of TOI. Experts said that removal of MEP is the first step towards tackling the volatility in onion prices.The Union government in its budget presented on Thursday had announced launching of Operation Greens scheme to address price fluctuations in onions, potato and tomato for benefit of farmers and consumers with budgetary allocation of Rs 500 crore for the scheme for the fiscal 2018-19.For two years since December 24, 2015 there was no MEP of on onions.However Centre re-imposed MEP on onions on November 23 last year at USD 850 per tonne. Thereafter on January 19, Centre had also reduced the MEP on onions to USD 700 per tonne.The sources from the ministry of agriculture said, During the recent meeting with the officials from the ministry of commerce, it had already been decided to remove the MEP on onions if the average wholesale onion prices dropped below Rs 2,000 per quintal. Now, the average wholesale onion prices have already dropped to Rs 1,500 per quintal. Hence, it had been immediately decided to remove the MEP of onions."

The Prime Minister likes to boast that it is much easier to do business in India now than it ever was.Indian farmers voted overwhelmingly for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2014 general election that swept him to power. He cannot count on them doing so again, as a crash in commodity prices and surging fuel costs stoke anger in the countryside.Four years ago, Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept Uttar Pradesh, Indias most populous state, winning 73 of 80 seats, as the rural poor  swayed by promises of higher crop prices  deserted the rival Congress party.Now, facing criticism for not improving living standards in the countryside, where 70 percent of Indias 1.3 billion people live, analysts and farm economists said Modi would find it hard to repeat the feat in a general election due by May 2019.While it is risky to predict election outcomes in India, where religion and caste remain important issues  not to mention the influence of fickle regional parties  interviews with some of the states millions of farmers suggest rural angst could cost the government dearly.No doubt, there was a wave for Modi in 2014, but farmers are disenchanted with him now, said sugar cane grower Uday Vir Singh, 53, plonking down on a wicker chair and smoking his hookah. Modi promised to double farmers income but our earning has halved because of his apathy and anti-farmer policies. Nearly half a dozen farmers sitting with Singh on a hand-woven rope cot, and many of others in Kairana  which elected a joint opposition candidate from a small regional party in a key by-election this week  accused Modi and the Uttar Pradesh administration, also run by the BJP, of failing to live up to their promises and overlooking the concerns of villagers.Modi is a very good salesman but we are not going to fall prey to his glib talk again, said 55-year-old Narendra Kalhande, who grows cane on his 2.5 acre farm. Farm Minister Radha Mohan Singh defended the governments record, citing initiatives on irrigation, crop insurance and electronic trading platforms for farmers to sell produce.For farmers, Prime Minister Modis 48 months have been much better than the Congresss rule of 48 years, Singh told Reuters, referring to the main opposition party that dominated Indian politics for most of the years since independence from British colonial rule in 1947.CRISIS IN COUNTRYSIDEHigher inflation and sluggish growth helped Modi trounce Congress, which had long counted the rural poor as its core constituency, in the 2014 election. Small farmers had been hit by rising living costs but benefited little from rising food prices because of the web of middlemen in Indias agricultural markets.Since then the economy has picked up, recording its quickest pace of expansion in nearly two years in the first three months of 2018, helped by higher growth in the farm sector. But lower food prices, weaker farm wages and modest crop procurement rates  the result of a shift in focus from the subsidies favoured by Congress to investment under the pro-business BJP  have hurt most of Indias 263 million farmers, who typically own less than 2 hectares of land.In the past year, Modis popularity has fallen by 12 percentage points among farmers, according to a Mood of the Nation survey published last week by the Lokniti, part of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), a research institute.Next years election would be fought on farmers issues, said Yogendra Yadav, a leading academic-turned-politician. Farmer organisations in some states began a 10-strike on Friday, in which they have said they will stop selling produce to protest a steep drop in the prices of an array of farm goods.Farm Minister Singh said his government had yet to hear from farm leaders but was ready to listen.COMMODITIES CRASHPrices of pulses, a key crop for Indian farmers, have fallen 25-30 percent below state-set support prices, as higher imports and bumper local crops bumped up supplies. While the government announces support prices for more than 20 crops each year to set a benchmark, state agencies actually buy only rice and wheat at the support level.Vegetable prices, especially onions, cabbage and tomatoes have fallen 25 percent from last year, largely because of the lack of refrigerated trucks that could take the perishables to the consuming big cities. Milk prices have also dived by more than 25 percent in the past year as a global glut has brought exports to a near halt.Farmers in Charkhi Dadri, three hours drive west of the capital New Delhi, recently dumped tomatoes onto the road in protest after buyers offered a quarter of a rupee per kilogram for a crop that costs at least 6 rupees ($0.09) a kg to produce.Jai Bhagwan, 54, borrowed 12,000 rupees to grow onions on a plot of about half acre in Jhajjar, an area otherwise famed for pottery. When his crop was ready, Jai Bhagwan could get only 1,200 rupees.I could not even recover my labour cost, said Jai Bhagwan, who was in New Delhi recently to participate in a farmers meet. Prakash Singh, also from Jhajjar, spent 6,000 rupees to grow green chilli, but the crop fetched him barely 200 rupees.Im in debt up to my eyeballs. But I cant sit idle, so Ill have to borrow more to grow something else, Singh said.Ashok Gulati, a farm economist who advised Indias last government, said there were three policy options to support farmers: building state buffer stocks to soak up excess supply, acting to boost exports or building capacity for processing farm commodities into end products such as milled, dehusked pulses or vegetable oils.Most of those measures would require long-term structural changes, however, and analysts predict in the run-up to the election Modi is likely to announce more populist, short-term fixes such as higher guaranteed prices for crops and farm loan waivers.Many farmers complained they are still reeling from disruptions caused by the launch of a new nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July 2017 and a ban on high denomination bank notes in November 2016. Blaming the shock move for exacerbating farmers financial woes, Gulati said: Expectations were high from the government, but the fact is that the plight of farmers is far worse now than what it was four years ago.Modis drive to purge black money from the economy by removing, at a stroke, 86 percent of the cash in circulation, made it difficult for farmers, who survive on cash, to buy inputs like seeds and receive payments for their crops.In Kairana, all 35 farmers Reuters spoke to agreed that abolishing 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes had made things worse.POWER SURGEFarmers in Uttar Pradesh, home to 220 million people, are also angry over a sharp rise in the pump price of diesel and a steep hike in electricity tariffs. Many farmers in the state use diesel to run tractors for ploughing and trolleys for moving their produce to wholesale markets. They depend on electricity to operate irrigation pumps.Diesel prices have shot up by more than 40 percent to record highs and electricity tariffs have surged by more 20 percent in the past two years, said Shri Pal, a farmer from Shamli.Villages account for most of Indias diesel consumption and thats why higher prices pinch farmers the most, but diesel in India is much more expensive than Bhutan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, said Hannan Mollah, a former lawmaker and a senior official of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).Kairana and Shamli lie in the sugar cane belt of Uttar Pradesh, the top sugar state of India, the worlds biggest producer after Brazil. Soaring global output has caused a collapse in sugar prices, leading to losses for mills who now owe nearly 23 billion rupees to cane growers.A BJP spokesman, G.V.L. Narasimha Rao, said the government has streamlined timely payments to cane growers. That has not been enough to satisfy farmers such as Ram Lakhan Singh, a cane grower from Shamli. Most sugar mills have not paid us a single rupee since December and the government has connived with them to deprive us of our rightful dues. Trust me, cane farmers will think twice before voting for the BJP.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

On Thursday, the government bit the bullet and seems poised to reap benefits for summoning the courage to stop incentivising a tiny section.The calculation is that the levy on capital gains on equity will, in part, provide the funds needed for Modicare, supposed to be the worlds largest public-funded health insurance scheme, an audacious initiative which should bury the political insinuation that Modis was a suit-boot ki sarkar.The charge had looked an exaggeration after the government managed to sell demonetisation as a wealth redistribution scheme, a tool which robbed the corrupt rich to pay the honest poor.The sheer optics of a Budget  which blends the imposition of capital gains tax with ambitious schemes of health insurance for the poor and paying farmers 50% over the cost of production along with benefits for women and senior citizens  should blunt whatever punch, if any, the Ambani-Adani taunt would have still packed.If the setback among Gujarat farmers warned government of rural unrest due to stagnation in agriculture, the Budget shows that the BJP leadership did not waste time imbibing the message.The plan to cushion producers and consumers of perishable crops like potatoes, onions and tomatoes against the vagaries of production should help deal with grouses that took away from the governments success in checking runaway inflation under the UPA and dulled the appeal of its welfare moves.Expansion of MSP cover to 24 crops covering 90% of arable land, extension of credit facility to animal husbandry and dairy farming and the plan to extend the benefit to share-croppers and lessees should calm a countryside thats displayed its annoyance with BJP yet again by going with Congress in the Rajasthan bypolls.The measures will amplify the message that Modi has sought to put across by providing free cooking gas connections to the poor, reaching electricity to thousands of unlit villages and constructing subsidised houses for the rural populace at a fast pace.Micro, small and medium enterprises have been celebrated as the new potential engine of growth, with benefits proposed to compensate them for the hit they took post-demonetisation and in the wake of GST rollout.Concern for job-creation that fits the conventional description was reflected in FMs incentives for labourintensive sectors of leather and textiles and the nudge to employers to formalise jobs.Sullenness among youth  another constituency, which like farmers, turned out in huge numbers for Modi in 2014  has emerged as a major worry. The government expects jobs to emerge from the thrust on infrastructure as well.Absence of tax relief for the middle class may not necessarily reflect a shift of affection away from Modi. It is sure to upset vocal categories, with the surprise decision to announce fixing salaries of MPs fuelling angst.But what looks like an ommision in a perfectly political budget may perhaps also be an indication that it may not be this governments last one before it faces the popular test."

""GST (goods and services tax) or no GST, Arun Jaitley 's proposals will not shake our household budget,"" says Vandana Kansal, homemaker and wife of private bank vice-president Sanjay Kansal The family, which lives in Sector 20 of Panchkula, says the budget is ""okay, okay"", neutral in terms of revenue and disappointing on the tax front. A reduction in the excise duty on petrol excise is a welcome step for it. ""Since most household items are now part of the GST system and this tax cannot be changed unless approved by the GST council , this year's budget was not so much about the prices of household items. The only upsetting this for the family budgets is not much tax relief for the salaried class,"" Vandana said.""The tax slabs should have been redefined as it has been a long back since the last big revision,"" said Sanjay Kansal. ""The slabs needed revision because rupee has depreciated. The salaried class gets standard deduction benefit of Rs 40000 but it will include medical allowance of Rs 15,000 and transport allowance of Rs 19,200. Effectively, this is very little benefit. With the cess increased from 3 to 4%, this class will actually end up paying more tax. With price rise unabated, practically we have less money in hand for savings and household expenditure.""The children of the family, however, are happy, as the budget lays emphasis on better opportunities for education and skill development. Engineering student Ritvik and Class-XI boy Kartikey are happy about cheaper footwear but sore about costlier mobiles and televisions.The budget has brought cheers to the family elders. Sanjay's mother, Santosh Kansal, said: ""As a senior citizen, I am happy for higher interest on my income up to Rs 50,000."" Being a bank officer, Sanjay's overall view on the budget was: ""Considering that it is sort of pre-poll budget and our farmers are in real distress, I'll call the proposals pro-farmer and pro-poor, even a watershed budget. The biggest provision is 'Modicare' on the lines of ' Obamacare ', where the poorest 10 crore families of 50 crore members will get annual medical care of up to Rs 5 lakh each in case of hospitalisation. It was needed. I like the provisions for farmers, be it Bamboo Mission or credit flow to agriculture and allied activities or mega food parks. Operation Green will help increase the production of potato, tomato, and onion, and save us from abnormal rise in the prices of these food items."""

The price quoted by the vendors on pavements was Rs 20 a kg in the late evening hours.Kailsah Tajni, the chairman of wholesale vegetable merchant association, APMC, told TOI, The price of tomatoes has come down to Rs 5-6 a kilo compared to Rs 6-7. But the kitchen staple sells at Rs 40 per unit at upmarket retail plazas, while the general price was Rs 20 a kg. Brinjal is sold at Rs 5 per kg in the wholesale market, but its prices jumped to Rs 30-60 a kg, depending upon the location. There has been a declining trend in wholesale prices of vegetables since the beginning of January due to an excellent winter crop, but the retailers had pocketed the benefit and unsuspecting customers were paying more. Retail rates of most vegetables remain high in Mumbai. Each year prices tend to drop after November 25 as winter sets in but this year rates did not fall until after December 15. On Friday, cauliflower is selling for Rs 60 per kg, brinjal Rs 80 and broccoli Rs 120, said Ayesha Bano, a resident of Four Bungalows, Andheri. Tomatoes are at Rs 16-22 and onions Rs 30.The Dadar Plaza Market is the main wholesale market of exotic vegetables. Trader Dharmendra Vaish said, Prices of most exotic vegetables including broccoli, zucchini and Chinese cabbage have dropped. In growing areas farmers are selling for Rs 7-8. The wholesale rate in Dadar is Rs 15-25 per kg. Retailers who factor in overhead costs and some profit can sell for Rs 35. If they are charging more than that it is profiteering.An experts said, the absence of space to sell directly produce had resulted in few markets and as a result the crash in wholesale prices had not been transferred to buyers."

In the process, the car rammed a police vehicle. Soon, a high-speed chase ensued for the next three hours even as the car was driven rashly on the highway. Finally, the smugglers were intercepted at Kanuru village and they were taken into custody.While conducting checks, the CTF officials seized around 300 kg of ganja packed in polythene covers from the vehicle.About 300 kg ganja worth of 50 lakh was seized and we also impounded the car. We are interrogating the accused. Investigation is still on, said a senior CTF official.Meanwhile, sources said that the gang was involved in the illegal trade for some time and has been notorious in supplying ganja to Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.The police said the accused were also involved in circulation of counterfeit currency. A case was registered against them under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. The CTF have been delegated to crack down on ganja smuggling in the city. Vijayawada stands as a major transit point for the smuggling in the recent years, however cops said that consumption is much lesser in the city. Recently, even the directorate of revenue intelligence too caught a number of major cases in Enkepadu area and other places where they have seized tonnes of Ganja this year. This isnt the first time the CTF are chasing down ganja smugglers in a dramatic fashion, four months ago they did nab a speeding truck near Nandigama area where they seized more than 900 grams of produce hidden amongst tomatoes."

Held at Noida's Ramlila Ground in Sector 21, the three-day event, organised by Noida Authority and The Floriculture Society, focused on the need for water conservation and growing plants  both indoors and outdoors  that help in controlling air pollution.Beautiful decorations with flowers were the main attraction at the event Manju Grover , General Secretary, The Floriculture Society, Noida, and a resident of Sector 12, said, ""Keeping in mind the deteriorating air quality, the aim of the 32nd edition of the flower show was to spread awareness about water conservation and anti-pollution plants. From plants to colourful pots and manure, seeds and gardening accessories  over 85 stalls at the event offered everything that one needs to set up a garden. The anti-pollution plants like jade, money plant, spider plant, dracaena and snake plant were quite in demand. Noida Authority also directed Noidawallahs , plant sellers and exhibitors not to use plastic vase for plants.""The visitors did not shy away from capturing the beauty in camera stillsTalking about her observations about the current trends among Noidawallahs, Manju told us, ""The trend of gifting plants has grown, so, small potted plants ranging from Rs 50 to Rs 500 were some of the hot sellers. Apart from this, a lot of Noidawallahs took a keen interest in understanding the concept of balcony gardens, tray gardens and vertical gardening, and some even placed orders for the same at different stalls.""Ceramic containers were available in different shapes and sizes Jyoti Dhanda , one of the sellers, said, ""This year, a lot of people took keen interest in understanding how to grow organic vegetables and fruits. Some of our bestsellers were a variety of salad greens, including iceberg lettuce, arugula, cherry tomatoes and herbs like celery, coriander, basil, mint and thyme, etc. Vegetables and fruits like brinjals, green and red chillies, bell pepper, tomatoes and lemon plants were also in demand. Visitors took home a lot of vegetable and flower seedlings, which were priced between Rs 8 to Rs 10. Due to the persistent termite problem in most of Noida apartments, people were keen on buying termite-resistant planters made from pinewood and sheesham wood.""Air-purifying plants were the highlight of the showShe added, ""It is a wonderful experience to exhibit at such shows as it helps in understanding market trends. For instance, a lot of Noidawallahs have started going back to nature. A lot of people want to understand about different ways of developing an organic garden.

There may be exceptions but it holds true for Perumal Murugan, the Tamil writer, several of whose books have been translated into English. The latest being Poonachi or The story of a black goat (Context).We meet at The Parks Mist restaurant for lunch. Asking the staff to suggest South Indian cuisine, Murugan quickly settles for onion uttapam. I can never say no to onion uttapam; its my favourite, he says with a genial smile. Meanwhile, fresh watermelon juice is served providing a perfect start to our chat.With a collection of poems and short stories and now Poonachi , Murugan seems to have gotten over the controversy created over his book Madhorubhagan or One Part Woman . Referring to it, he observes, I do not hold any grudge or hard feelings. What I am very sorrowful about is that peoplewho did not read my book protested against it. That is what dismayed me. It must have been hard giving up writing? No, on the contrary, I got enough time to spend with my family, grow potted plants and devote time to academics, says Murugan with the help of an interpretor.For Murugan, writing has been a second nature since he was eight. There was a childrens programme on Trichy radio station in which poems written by kids were read out. I used to regularly contribute for that. I wrote everyday because I am introvert, retiring and shy by nature. I did not talk a lot, and always avoided crowds. So, writing poems and stories substituted social interaction. Believe it or not, I managed to fill up 30 notebooks, he recalls.Writing short stories commenced from Class IX. I was inspired after reading graphic tales in magazines which I could not afford but my aunt used to buy. Gradually, my teachers came to know and encouraged me to participate in local school contests. Thus set in motion was Murugans life long passion for chiselling words.Pursuing Ph.D., Murugans first novel Eru Veyyil (The Rising Heat) was published in 1991 which he wrote during his summer vacations. I was 25 then and wrote it staying with my mother in a thatched hut with no electricity. My mother would be busy with the livestock while I lost sense of time adhering to my own clock. I used to only sleep, eat and write, never going out. This got her worried with many suggesting that I had lost my mind. So before returning to Chennai, she made me wear a holy thread blessed by a pujari around the waist. Every time I returned home I had to show it to her, he jests. As a child he loved sitting on a village boulder scribbling in his notebooks. My neighbours would tell me that one day I will get stuck to the boulder and would have to be surgically separated from it.Having lost his father early, Murugan was very close to his mother. I was called a mamas boy even after I got married. In a certain sense I narrate my mothers story through Poonachi. Like the goat, she too was the seventh child who lost her mother at birth; was a loner with her father being rarely at home. Their filial bond is so strong that even today Murugan has kept his mothers cell phone and SIM card as a memory.So is Murugan like his mother, a staunch believer of God? In my early years I was, visiting Kali and Murugan temples regularly. Later, studying Marxism and Periyars works, I started questioning, with the intensity of worship coming down. Those days, I argued with my mother on several occasions. Over the years reading more on these issues, I have come to the conclusion that whether God exists or not is not important but what is pertinent is whether He is necessary or not. For those He is, they must believe in Him without being criticised. Espousing live and let live, his belief sounds fair. Continuing, he adds, I do like to spend time at some of my favourite temples and tend to embrace the spiritual component of religion.The staff brings in sizzling onion uttapam with different chutneys, the coconut and its mint and tomato flavoured versions. Trying each of them, Murugan, gestures his appreciation. The uttapam is crisp and well made and the chutneys delicious. Not averse to trying local cuisine, the writer generally prefers South Indian dishes. I relish idlis, ragi dosa made with palm sugar, rice and paruppu kuzhambu; dishes made of country chicken but staying in Korea for a writers residency I had local preparation for a month without any fuss. Hailing from a rural region, Murugan has a weakness for vegetables. I love bitter gourd, suraikai (bottle gourd), lady finger, podalangai (snake gourd), brinjal and peerkangai (ridge gourd). The joke at home is whenever I am sent to buy vegetables these are bound to figure. Murugan does miss some preparations of his native place like kachayam, made of rice flour and jaggery and soiyang, a steamed pulse based dish kneaded with palm sugar. With passage of time, people have stopped making them.Calling himself a reasonable cook, Murugan reveals that like writing, he embraced cooking very early in life. With my parents leaving early to work on fields, my brother and I used to prepare and eat breakfast and walk five kilometres to school. We simply learnt by observing mother and helping her. He counts arisi paruppa, milagai (black pepper) and herbal rasams as his best preparation. The ridge gourd subzi I whip up, is relished by my wife so much that on returning home after holidays she always asks me to make it.Murugans felicity with cooking comes across in some of his works too. Yes, it does, but not deliberately, only on demand of the narrative. For example, in Arthanari and Aalavayan , sequels to the One Part Woman , I talk about how to grow and prepare a local variety of egg plant as mother used to. In Poonachi, I write about rice gruel and how to make dry salted meat pieces for future use. Likewise, in Seasons of the Palm there is description of ragi porridge.Drawing parallelsHaving learnt to wield the pen and cooking spud since childhood, Murugan says one can draw a lot of parallels between the two arts. For cooking and writing, passion, perseverance and persistence are must. Also to excel in their craft, the cook and writer must get out of their comfort zone and try something new. And eventually, both food and a work of literature must satisfy people.Reflecting on the making of a writer, Murugan states, The command over language and the content selection comes with experience. The foundation of good writing is the ability to get past ones own value system because that is what holds us from absorbing a lot of things. A good writer has to suspend his own value system and assimilate experiences. Did this come to him naturally? No, in many of my early works, for example, my short story collection, Thiruchengodu , I was heavily biased. Later I got over them and started writing on issues considered taboo by society. Examples of these are Pee Kadaigal (tales about shit) and Kethavarthe Pesarae (I speak bad words).Talking about keeping aside biases, Murugan is remarkable for etching characters which are neither black nor white. I avoid creating one dimensional characters. I believe all humans are a mix of both. In Poonachi, the old lady who is very caring to the goat becomes selfish when it comes to her survival. In her early years, her love is pure and selfless while later when she faces financial crunch, her kindness becomes conditional but that does not make her an villain. That is the way humans are, he remarks as we wind up our interaction.What I am very sorrowful about is that people who did not read my book protested against it. That is what dismayed me"

It is used to establish the diversity between populations, authenticate a species and in timber forensics.The process of DNA isolation involves treating the tissue sample from a species in chemical solutions called buffers, which is put in a column (a small container) and processing them in a centrifuge, which isolates the DNA. Earlier, this process was done manually, which would take almost a day. Later, there were several commercial kits which simplified the DNA isolation process.But these kits worked well only for commercial crops such as rice, tomato or cotton. When it came to tree tissue samples, most of these commercial kits usually dont yield results as trees have certain chemical compounds called secondary metabolites, which tamper with the reactions, said Modhumita Dasgupta, a scientist at the department of plant biotechnology in IFGTB, who was part of a group of scientists which devised the kit. Dasgupta said they have introduced an extra buffer solution in the kit which would remove secondary metabolites from tree tissues, thus giving pure DNA samples.She added that they first devised the protocol for their own laboratory use. They had patented it in 2009. Last year, the institute registered the trademark ArborEasy. The ready-to-use kit was launched on January 24.Dasgupta said those kits which yielded results for tree tissue samples were expensive. It cost around Rs200 to Rs300 for one reaction. But we have brought it down to Rs95 per reaction, Dasgupta said. Also the kit gives a high amount of DNA compared to other commercial kits, she said.In one reaction, our kit yields the amount of DNA other commercial kits yield in two, she said. In case of difficult tissues, our kits yield DNA, when others give none, she added.The kit isolates DNA from tissue samples in just around 90 minutes, said Dasgupta. She added that the DNA isolated using the kit has very high purity and a longer shelf-life, Dasgupta said. The DNA isolated using the kit can be used for experiments. We have used it for sequencing sandalwood genome, she added.The institute is also planning to commercialize the innovation, officials said. DNA isolation kits have a huge market today. Almost every college has students who do projects which involve DNA isolation at some level, Dasgupta said.For the first time, the institute has been planning to market the product in e-commerce portals, said S Murugesan, scientist and group coordinator for research, IFGTB. We also have asked for a seed funding to set up a unit in the institute to produce the kits commercially, he said."

And this has started affecting their price in the retail market.Usually, during February and March, the supply of vegetables is stable as the air can hold moisture for a long time and it is suitable to store them for one to two days. In April, the supply starts dropping and two months later the prices soar by around 25% to 30%.Currently, the supply of cauliflower has been reduced from 336 bags (50kg each) to 325 bags. Similarly, tomato supply has come down to 1,300 crates from 1,500 crates in 10 days. The marginal reduction in supply has led to increase in prices. The tomatoes that now cost Rs 20 per kg in the retail market costed Rs 14 per kg 10 days ago.Mohan Salpe , secretary of agriculture produce market committee, said, Only a required amount of vegetables is being harvested by farmers every day. The supply is already coming down, the effects of which will be visible in next one week. Vegetables, being a perishable produce, gets easily spoiled during high temperature. Also, adequate care needs to be taken while transporting vegetables during summer. At the same time, the supply of some vegetables such as spinach increases these days as farmers cannot keep such produce in the farm for more days unlike brinjal (eggplant) or tomatoes.The vegetable supply in retail markets comes from the nearby rural parts of the district. The sugarcane farmers tend to cultivate vegetables as inter-crop in their farms after sugarcane is cut and sent to the mills. Such vegetables are available in abundant during January and February.However, now the supply of vegetables grown as intercrop starts declining and the retail markets depend on vegetables supplied from the distant places that makes it costly owing to the transportation cost."

They have formed a group and set up a sales outlet at Athappa Gounden Pudur near L&T Bypass in the city on Wednesday to sell their farm produce directly to people.This comes against the backdrop of the prices of perishable farm produce such as tomatoes touching a low in glut season, forcing farmers to go for distress sales or dump them as waste. Though in such times perishable produce are bought from farmers for very low prices, they are sold for prices several times higher in retail outlets. Farmers say this is because of middlemen commission and transport charges being added to the price.Farmers who started the outlet said direct sales will ensure a decent profit margin for them and also bring down the selling price as middlemen will be eliminated. They also said such outlets will connect local farmers with consumers, providing a sustainable business model for farmers.The district president of farmers association, A S Babu, said the major cost addition in farm produce was transport cost. If people travel to Coimbatore from Sulur to buy farm produce, the cost will be significantly higher, as the transport cost and labour cost will be added along with commission for middlemen. Farmers outlets will do away with such costs, Babu said.Babu said the price of onions sold by farmers had fallen by five times in the past two months. But big retailers sold the same onions for almost 1.5 to 2 times the price. If farmers sell it directly, the price would be much lesser, said Babu. He added that through their outlet they would also give their produce to wholesale sellers. State treasurer of farmers association C Thangaraj said such an outlet was new to the region. There have been such efforts in places such as Karur and Erode, he said. He added that they saw agriculture as a local market, so they sought to connect farmers and consumers from a locality."

The centre was established in 2004 with the motive to reduce post-harvest losses by creating value added products from farm produce. A year later, it started offering training programmes.""Generally, during glut season, the price of a product drops drastically. In such times, farmers throw away perishable goods such as tomatoes. In order to reduce such wastage, we invite them and show them how they can produce value added products such as ketchup using tomatoes,"" says N Varadaraju, head of the centre.The incubator at the centre offers monthly training programmes in food processing under eight units  juices, jams, ketchup, masalas, pickles, bakery products, pasta and millet milling.

Varadaraju says some of the participants of the monthly programmes would want to pursue it as a business. ""For a fee of Rs 10,000, we allow them to use the equipment at the centres master kitchen for one year. They can manufacture their products and also pack them at the centre. But they themselves have to take care of the marketing,"" he says. A total of 12 MoUs are signed every year, he adds.Through its bakery unit, the centre trains people to make millet-based value- added products such as bread and cookies. The bakery unit also makes other items such as cakes, buns and puffs, says P Vennila, professor at the centre, and in-charge of the bakery unit. It has a counter sales unit, where the products prepared by in-house staff are sold.Of the hundreds of people the centre has trained, around 30 have started their own ventures in Coimbatore and across the state and have been functioning successfully, said officials at the centre."

None of these promises have been kept. The BJP government ought to be termed a government that does not keep promises.He said, We have a similar experience with the Fadnavis government in Maharashtra too, and farmers are planning a march from Nasik to Mumbai, to gather outside the state assembly in protest. The farmers of Rajasthan have inspired movements in other parts of the country. The chief minister probably believes that by stopping farmers from arriving today, she has scuttled the movement. If the government goes back on its word, it will be faced with a bigger protest than Rajasthan, Dhawale said.Joint secretary of AIKS Vijoo Krishnan said, The CPI-M government in Kerala has offered pension of Rs1,100 to farmers above 60 years of age, over and above the pension available to old people. If the government of Kerala can do it, why cannot Rajasthan? The procurement price of grain in Kerala is higher by Rs800 per quintal than elsewhere. The government says it does not have money to waive farm loans. Vikram Kothari of Rotomac pens got loans of over Rs3,000 crore to import wheat. Wheat is not even produced in Singapore.

Theres also a new attraction this year  Tomatina (tomato-throwing festival)  and most of these celebrations are lined along the Beach Road. Around three tonnes of overripe tomatoes have been procured from the markets and farmers for the Tomatina festival, which is being held for the first time in Vizag.However, green NGOs have cautioned the denizens on wastage of thousands of litres of water during the Holi fest and have stressed on the need for water conservation.Though preparations and pujas for Holika Dahan (bonfire lit at night prior to Holi) were held on Thursday night, most of the programmes will be held on Friday including the Street Festival and Balam Pichkari.The street festival would start in the morning and continue till 11 pm. The main attractions are food and fashion bazaar, Tomatina, rain dance, camp fire, rock band and sky lanterns at RK Beach, opposite Hawa Mahal beside Gokul Park. The other programme, Balam Pichkari, is being organised by the Akhil Bhartiya Marwari Mahila Samiti, Maheshwari Yuva Manch and Marwari Yuva Manch.Here, the celebrations include rain dance, Bollywood music and unlimited food at DSR Gardens, MVP Colony.

Holi celebrations and DJ music would also be held in Bollywood style at MGM grounds near Beach Road.Meanwhile, Vijay Potnuru, member of the NGO Trendsetters and Meecons, said: Holi is a traditional festival which people have been playing since ages, without wasting a lot of water. However, the recent fads of rain dance in big groups and such Holi parties on a grand scale is leading to a lot of water wastage, especially before summer, when almost always water shortages occur in the city. Environment conscious denizens should come up voluntarily to stop such mass-scale water wastage and focus on conservation of water through construction of rainwater harvesting pits.P Santosh from NGO Ken Foundation also requested the public to play Holi by using dry gulal and coloured powders instead of wasting several litres of water."

Nearly 500 kgs of tomatoes would be procured for the event and participants will throw those tomatoes at each other. We hope to make it a memorable Holi celebration for Vizagites this year, Srinivas said.He added that the Tomatina festival will also indirectly help the farmers as their overripe tomatoes, which normally would have gone waste, was fetching them money. As the city has been attracting tourists from across the globe, such unique festivals will further add to the citys charm, Srinivas said, adding that there will be a food and music festival too as part of Tomatina.He said around 500 people have already registered for the festival, and said they were expecting the number to reach 1,000.

Potato crop is also likely to remain down to stagnant this sowing season, horticulture departments senior official said.The official said, Heavy losses suffered by onion and tomato farmers in the past months has discouraged sowing.In June 2017, farmers staged protest in the entire state after onion prices slid to Rs 2 per kg. Tomato prices have also tumbled this season to Rs 5 per kg-Rs 8 per kg in the wholesale market on increased arrivals.Agriculture experts said, even the soil moisture remained less during the sowing period owing to less rains.Farmers shifted to chana as it gave better returns to farmers last season. Also chana requires less water making it the preferred choice of farmers when rains are not sufficient, said Kailash Agrawal , an agriculture expert.Chana and wheat are the leading winter sown crops of the region.Agriculture departments statistics stated that farmers have sown wheat on over 5.75 lakh hectare while chana was sown on 4.75 lakh hectare in Indore division.Horticulture department expects yield of potato to remain lower this season hitting output due to lower soil moisture.Mohan Pandey, a wholesaler of vegetables in Choithram market said, Prices of onions and tomatoes are unlikely to pick up from the current levels in near term as supplies from the old stocks and neighbouring states are sufficient to meet the demand."

The WPI data showed prices of pulses contracted an annual 24.3%, while those of vegetables rose 15.4% during the month, slower than the 36.7% rise in the previous month. Onion prices remained stubborn, increasing nearly 80% in February but lower than 127% in the previous month.Available trends suggest a pick-up in prices of some cereals, edible oils and milk was offset by a continued correction in prices of onions and tomatoes in the current month. Moreover, average crude oil prices so far in March 2018 remain lower than the trend for the previous month. However, an unfavourable base effect for crude petroleum and natural gas, and fuel and power is likely to push up the WPI inflation in March 2018.

In reply to an email, a PepsiCo India spokesperson said the variants will have 11% juice and will be sold in smaller serves of 250ml at an affordable price point.While sugary carbonated drinks attract GST of 40%, companies pay around 12% GST on juices, said an industry expert. PepsiCos new drinks are slated to fall into the latter category.The new range of locally relevant, fruit juice drink with fizz under brand Slice will be available as a pilot in select markets to start with, said the spokesperson. Rural and rest of urban (RoU) segments are currently 60% of the juice category and have been growing faster than metros. By riding on both company and franchise go-to-market sales and distribution infrastructure, we want to dial up growth and market access for our juice products in these key rural, RoU markets.Over the last few years, the Rs 14,000-crore carbonated soft drink industry in India has faced flak from consumers, who suddenly had a plethora of healthier options, such as dairy products or juices from local players to choose from.Akhil Gupta, MD of New Delhi-based Fresca Juices said, We introduced juices in all possible pack sizes, from 160ml and 300ml to one-litre and even two-litre economy packs. Starting with just one litchi flavour, Fresca has currently introduced new flavours, including orange mojito and tomato.Prices of carbonated drinks also witnessed an upward trend with the government increasing sin tax. To add to the woes of biggies, small regional players cropped up, launching 250ml PET bottles at Rs 10, which often mimicked variants from the larger players.

J Saravanan is one of the very few who dared to abandon his profession as a goldsmith to become a parotta master and subsequently launch the super-hit food joint, Sri Mahesh Tiffin Centre.Known especially for its egg-less kaima parotta, laba parotta and veechu parotta, Saravanans eatery, which opened seven years ago at Bajanaikuda Street in Palakarai , has people swarming every night to taste the delicious food items. Passion for cooking was something I picked up while I was learning to become a goldsmith in Sri Lanka, says Saravanan. In the mornings, I used to get trained to open a jewellery workshop while at nights I found time to learn to prepare parottas, he said.After staying in Sri Lanka for close to eight years, Saravanan moved back to India in the mid-nineties and was working as a goldsmith for about four years. I soon realised that it was not something I wanted to keep doing and hence took up the job of a parotta master at an eatery and worked there for about nine years, the 47-year-old recalled. On gaining confidence to start an eatery, he didnt think twice before plunging into the food business. Right from the first day, the response has been really good and close to 200 customers visit my place every day now, he said.Open from 6.45 pm to 12 am, kaima parotta, laba parotta and veechu parotta  which are available for Rs 50, Rs 40 and Rs 15 per plate respectively -- get over in an hours time thanks to the huge demand. I dont use egg in any of these varieties and for kaima parotta especially. Unlike other eateries, I also dont use ingredients like ajinomoto that are not good for digestion, he claimed. Since Im both the owner and parotta master, I dont dish out items in an unhealthy way to decrease the preparation cost, he said.The main ingredients of kaima parotta at his eatery are parottas, ginger garlic paste, coriander leaves and tomatoes. Apart from these parotta varieties, kuska, idli and idiyappam are also highly sought-after among the customers. When asked if he had any plans to expand his business in the future, Saravanan said, I get tempted to do so every once in a while. But many have had huge failures when they got too ambitious and expanded their eateries. Im just playing the waiting game for now, he stated.What: Egg-less kaima parotta, laba parotta and veechu parottaWhen: 6.45 pm to 12 amWhere: Bajanaikuda street, Palakarai"

He found the man haggling with an ambulance driver to get his dead childs body to the graveyard. Pasha saw the father send the body off and then head in his direction. He wanted to know if there was a canteen nearby where he could have a meal. The man hadnt eaten all day, he said, hoping to save the money for his childs treatment. It was that encounter that led to the initiative Doh Roti  started by Pasha and his friend Fayaz Ahmed about two months ago.Along with a group of volunteers and help from well-wishers, they make and distribute 400 meals (rice and dal) and 300 rotis to relatives of patients atHospital,Cancer Hospital and Al Bilal Diagnostic Center.The duo first began distributing meals to about 300 people every day near IGICH. Later, they met Mysurus Body Miyan Ayub Ahmed (who has been performing the last rites for unclaimed bodies, for the last twenty years in Mysuru), and Azhar Maqsudi (who feeds the hungry in Hyderabad in a similar initiative). With help and advice from them, Pasha and Ahmed scaled up and Doh Roti was started.(BM wrote about Ayub Ahmed on Feb 13, 2017 - Call him Body Miyan.)Pasha, who runs a hotel in, says: We took a room in Bilal Masjid to cook the food. Now we are a group of 25 volunteers. Every day, we cook between 10 am and 1 pm. After prayers, we begin the distribution. In the first round, relatives of patients at Jayadeva hospital and Al Bilal Diagnostic Center get the meals. Then, we go toand distribute there.The groups aim, he says, is to ensure that nobody sleeps hungry. Hunger has no religion, he adds.Arul Subramani, who runs an NGO for those infected with HIV, volunteers with this group.Weve been friends for a long time so it was easy to make this possible. We cook about 35 kg of rice every day. We also need about 12 kg of onion and tomato, 3 kg of other vegetables; this we usually get through contributions. A small food company here gives the 300 rotis. Each meal costs us Rs22, he explains.Sometimes, demand overshoots supply, and they have to replenish before heading for Kidwai, but its all taken care of.Ahmed, who co-founded the initiative, saysis a hospital hub. Patients come from various parts of the state and country for treatment and they stay on. While the government provides free food for patients, their caretakers have to fend for themselves. Not everybody can afford to eat out three meals. This is why we want to help, he explains.Luckily for them, theres plenty of help available. Their initiative has inspired others to open their hearts too. Ansar Khan, also a volunteer, tells how. I buy the vegetables from a shop in Madiwala. One day, the woman from whom I buy in bulk got curious and asked me why I needed so much every day and I explained to her our work. From then on, she has refused to take money for the vegetables, says Khan.Hundreds, if not thousands, of people have benefited from the teams dedicated efforts already.Anjanappa Nayka, whose son is being treated at Jayadeva Hospital, has come to the city from Raichur. I came here seven days ago. It is really hard to afford the food here; it is three times more expensive. A person at the hospital told me about the free food in the afternoon. It has been a relief; there are others like me too who have benefited from this, he said.The initiative is such a hit now that Ayub Ahmed has started it in Mysuru at. And team has also finalised the plan to start this in Tumakuru."

Though the output has doubled in the last three months, the prices are yet to pick up. On Monday, the model price for the number one variety stood at Rs. 56 per 10 kg box, and the second at Rs. 30 per box.Though the stocks are reaching the Madanapalle market in several loads, the prices are not encouraging, say the farmers. From the last week of April, the produce showed signs of cracks due to intolerance to the abnormal heat. Mercury hardly crossed 35 degrees Celsius in the previous years in the area. For this reason, the first variety loads have dwindled, leaving the second variety to thrive, causing concern at trading.As the undamaged stocks are being sent to all over Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and other southern States, the domestic market has to depend on the loads with cracks and black spots.No cheer till JuneThe trade is unlikely to bring cheers to the farmers till May end or June first week, though it is projected that the stocks reaching the market would increase from the present 360 tonnes a day to more than 500 tonnes.Expecting profits, the farmers of Anantapur district, Chintamani, Rayalpadu and other border areas of Karnataka are also thronging the Madanapalle market. Despite the discouraging conditions, they have some consolation that the price is better than their domestic markets.Market Committee (Madanapalle) Chairman Ratakonda Gurappa Naidu said compared to the other markets in Rayalaseema or the southern States, the trade is not that disappointing. By the next two weeks, the heat might come down with seasonal showers or monsoons arrival. We are expecting bulk stocks from this month end. The situation is likely to improve soon, he said."

The Economic Survey points out that farm income may decline by more than 4% in a year. Heavy rainfall reduces income by 13.7% and 5.5% for kharif and rabi crops respectively.The budget provides for greater use of clean and renewable energy sources but does not deal with the management of climate change in relation to farming. It is important to set up climate risk management R&D centres at the block level. Such centres should be supported by trained climate risk managers. Climate change could become a mega catastrophe and there is need for immediate steps both in the areas of mitigation and adaptation The budget has provisions which can insulate farmers from distress sale and poor income . The finance minister has announced minimum support price (MSP) for all unannounced crops of kharif at one-and-a-half times of their production cost. If income is less than the support price, the government has said that it will make efforts to buy the surplus produce of the farmers.More allocation will be made for building warehouses and for upgrading 22,000 rural haats into grameen agricultural markets. The budget sets apart 2,000 crore for an agricultural market and infrastructure fund. Several steps have been proposed for promoting sustainable agriculture such as organic farming. Horticulture will be promoted with greater attention to the marketing of tomato, potato and onion and similar perishable commodities through operation greens with 500 crore allocation.Another welcome feature is to integrate attention to fisheries and animal husbandry with kissan credit cards.The national bamboo mission will be restructured in order to enhance the cultivation and consumption of bamboo products. The emphasis placed on self help group formation, cooperatives and other organisational methods which can provide the power of scale to the small scale producers is welcome.The priority given to rural infrastructure and irrigation will help impart stability of income and employment. Malnutrition is another serious problem and we need to promote symbiotic linkages among agriculture, nutrition and health.On the whole, the budget addresses some of the hotspots in the field of farming, the most important being the management of the monsoon and the market."

He has made a budgetary allocation of Rs 500 crore for the scheme.'Operation Greens shall aim at promoting Farmer Producers Organizations (FPOs), agri-logistics, processing facilities and professional management.The announcement of this scheme comes at a time when onion farmers of Nashik, the largest onion growing district in the country, are at the receiving end as they are not getting the right prices for their produce in the market.The scheme, insisted experts and farmers, will go a long way in preventing financial losses to onion growers following crash in wholesale onion prices that they often have to cope up with.According National Horticulture Research & Development Foundation (NHRDF) sources, the average production cost for growing onions is around Rs 900 per quintal and farmers incur losses if they get the price below that.But there have been several occasions in the past when the wholesale onion prices had crashed increasing the woes of the onion farmers of the district. And they had restored to agitations by organising protests like road roko demanding redressal of their grievances.Some onion farmers still recalled the huge crash of onion about two years back forcing 1.94 lakh onion farmers of the district to sell around 28 lakh quintals of onions at Rs 300-400 per quintal in just two months in 2016. They incurred financial losses of Rs 150 cr during that time.A major onion grower of the district Nivrutti Nyaharkar said that for long the onion farmers of Nashik have been demanding a scheme like Operation Greens to tackle the problem of onion price volatility."

The miseries of financially distressed farmers seem far from over even as they continue to demand waiver of farm loans and remunerative prices for their produce through several platforms across the country.The problem of plenty has hit the farmers badly. While garlic farmers in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, which produce 45% of the countrys garlic, recently fetched as low as Rs. 1 a kg in wholesale prices, the instances of tomato farmers dumping their harvest on the fields earlier this month  be it in Haryana, Tamil Nadu or Uttar Pradesh after prices nosedived  have only highlighted their woes. Tomato production during 2017-18, according to the first advance estimate, is likely to be 7.8% higher than that of the previous year. However, it is 20% higher than the average production of the past five years. Similarly, potato production is estimated to be 1.5% higher than that of the previous year. However, compared with the average production of the past five years, it is 8.7% higher. These figures indicate that farmers are producing more without good returns. Why are vegetable farmers not getting a fair price? Season after season, farmers face price uncertainties mainly owing to fluctuations in demand and supply caused by bumper or poor production, speculation and hoarding by traders.Are traders manipulating prices?In Madhya Pradesh, after garlic prices dropped sharply, the government decided to include it in the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (Price Deficit Payment Scheme) that was introduced in the Kharif 2017 season. Farmers, however, rue that with the conditions associated with the scheme, most of them are unable to gain any benefit. The scheme is aimed at providing price deficit payments to farmers if the market prices are below the minimum support price. Farmer leaders believe the implementation of this scheme in the first season has resulted in little benefit to farmers, with very little to prevent manipulation of prices by traders. The government claims to have disbursed Rs. 1,900 crore in compensation, but a large section of farmers has been excluded from the scheme, says Jai Kisan Andolan national convener Avik Saha. Those left out bore the brunt of a larger price crash because of market manipulation.What is the way forward?The fluctuation in vegetable prices has become a perennial problem and is usually associated with the economics of demand and supply. Farmers, mainly marginal and small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. Being perishable, vegetables are more prone to price fluctuation, hence they require better infrastructure for storage and marketing. Contract farming is an alternative for farmers to reduce financial risks by providing an assured market for their produce at a pre-agreed price. The Centre last week approved the State/UT Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2018. The Act lays stress on protecting the interests of farmers, considering them as weaker of the two parties entering into a contract. The Act is aimed at ensuring the purchase of the entire pre-agreed quantity of one or more of produce, livestock or its product. Although varied forms of contract farming exist in some pockets, a formal system is not widespread. By and large, cultivation of commercial crops such as cotton, sugarcane, tobacco, tea, coffee, rubber and dairy has had some elements of informal contract farming.Experts believe that integration of vegetable and fruit growers with agro-processing units through contract farming could prove beneficial to producers as it takes care of price fluctuations and helps to mitigate production risk. Pratap Singh Birthal, professor at the National Institute of Agricultural Economics and Policy Research, says: Under the contract farming law, the agreements would help farmers get an assured price for the produce, which will act as a buffer against price volatility and market fluctuations...Vikas Vasudeva"

Not selling vegetables and milk would only result in their own loss.However, Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who is scheduled to kick off the partys campaign for the upcoming Madhya Pradesh polls at a rally on the first anniversary of the Mandsaur farmer deaths, tweeted: Everyday, 35 farmers in our country commit suicide. Our farmer brothers are forced to go on a 10 day strike to draw the central governments attention towards the agrarian crisis. .Saying that the strike was a direct affirmation of the Kisan Virodhi policies of the Modi government, a statement by Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said the MP State government was trying to suppress the protests by using illegal means.Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said the farming community faced a crisis due to the indifferent attitude of the Centre. The BJP government had failed to provide any succour to the beleaguered farmers, who were unable to make both ends meet due to its antagonistic policies, he said.Supplies dropMeanwhile, prices of perishables rose in some cities of Punjab, Haryana and M.P. as fresh supplies dipped.

While more than 100 farmers outfits participated in the strike, major organisations in the State like the Raju Shetti-led Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana refrained from actively participating in the protest.In Khed Shivapur, farmers condemned the apathy of the Devendra Fadnavis-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government by spilling thousands of litres of milk along Pune-Bengaluru highway.Similar scenes were witnessed near Sinnar-Shirdi highway in Nashik. Farmers demonstrated by spilling milk and demanding a complete loan waiver and immediate implementation of the recommendations put forward by the M.S. Swaminathan Committee on agrarian reform.

But, given the trail of films made by RGV in recent years, somewhere midway through Officer the thought that cropped up is, at least this one is not an assault on the senses, so far rather than being wowed by whats being shown on screen.Officer has an interesting story, which the filmmaker reveals is based on real incidents. Hyderabad-based cop Sivaji Rao (Nagarjuna) is asked to head a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe into the ways of Narayan Passary, a cop credited with finishing off the Mumbai underworld, but who has now fallen from grace. Its an insider perspective of the police force and its dark corners. Can a cop himself build another underworld company to avenge his contemporaries? Throw in a few personal relationships and you get the necessary emotional heft.It sounds good as an idea but on screen, there are uninteresting stretches. It feels like were watching it from a distance without ever being invested in the proceedings. RGV has explored the crime-underworld-cops tropes before and excelled in his initial years, but this one doesnt have the zing. Several moves are over-explained and theres no surprise. In that scene where Passary is swiftly cornered and arrested, its doesnt take long to guess that the tables will eventually turn. There isnt enough backstory to these cops who are at loggerheads  one keeps harping that he did everything for the system and that he likes to torture people before they die; the other is just squeaky clean. The occasional underworld characters are caricature-like rather than fearsome. One of them plays a double-edged game but that too isnt explored well.The only reason to keep watching is Nagarjuna, who tries his best to hold things together. For all his display of agility and professionalism as an SIT officer, one only wishes for a better script. Myra Sareen and child actor Kaavya dont make a strong impression. And, it looked like the child actor was asked to display exaggerated emotions than being natural.RGVs fascination for unusual camera angles continues, thankfully they arent nausea-inducing. Several empty glasses are in focus  see a room through a glass, listen to a conversation through several glasses theres a scene where Nagarjuna is on a video chat with his parents who are seated at the dining table lined with two rows of empty glasses and an oddly-placed tomato. I dont remember the conversation because the focus was more on the glasses and the tomato.Officer also gets voyeuristic where it shows a close shot of the villain with pliers in his hand, threatening to splice off a childs fingers. The camera turns away but we know hes done it, because of the atmospherics. What were they thinking depicting such a sequence?The best part is, it all gets over in a little more than two hours."

Traders are reporting no shortages. Yet vegetable prices are at the upper end of the normal spectrum as retailers cite spoilage due to summer heat.APMC's former director and wholesale trader Shankar Pingale said, ""The average number of 550 trucks arrived Saturday. The market is closed on Sunday so we will assess the impact on Monday morning. But our farmers are continuing to dispatch produce because they have cultivated a good crop, so we do not expect any shortage or price increase for Mumbaikars.""Most vegetables are selling for Rs 60-80 per kg in retail markets of Khar, Andheri, Chembur, Bhandup, Malad and Borivli.Santosh Kesarwani, a greengrocer at Ahimsa Road, Khar, said, ""The only visible increase has come in tomato which has risen to Rs 25-35 from Rs 16-20 earlier. Spoilage is rampant during summertime and this causes farmers and vendors to charge more. A 25-kg box is being quoted for Rs 800 instead of Rs 400. Also, vegetables grown within Maharashtra are cheaper than those which come from other states. Most of Mumbai's tomato supply arrives from farmlands in Karnataka and transporters are charging more to cover the distance because of the strike.""On Sunday, tomato sold for Rs 40 per kg in certain shops of Chembur and Matunga but remained an average of Rs 25 in parts of Andheri and Bhandup.Cauliflower, lady finger, cluster beans (gavar) all sold for Rs 80 per kg in Andheri East, Khar, Chembur and Bandra East. The typical variation across localities was apparent in the quality and cost of produce.Meanwhile the cost of fruit, especially watermelon has risen owing to the seasonal spike witnessed during the holy fast of Ramzan. A single fruit averaging 2.5 kg sells for Rs 65-70 at Rs 25 per kg. However, alphonso mangoes are available abundant and cheap at Rs 250-350 per dozen as the king of fruit has flooded the market. Lychees have made a grand entry at Rs 60-70 per dozen which should settle to Rs 40 as the days wear on.Milk prices are stable. Cattlesheds in Goregaon and Jogeshwari are unaffected by the milk farmers' agitation. ""We hiked rates of loose milk before Ramzan and are now selling both cow and buffalo milk for Rs 70 per litre,"" said an attendant of Ghaswalla dairy in Jogeshwari. ""The strike does not impact us.""National dairies are doing their best to cope. The spokesperson of Mother Dairy Fruit & Vegetable said, ""We are keeping a close watch on the situation. However, we have made adequate arrangements at our end to ensure (proper) sourcing as well as supplies to the market."

Today, we have received very less quantity of vegetables from Punjab side and are not primarily dependent upon the produce from Himchal Pradesh and down South, he said.Krishan Kant, a wholesaler in Sector 26 grain market said, There has been a fluctuation in prices from past one week, but after the strike the prices of tomatoes and potatoes have shot up as these produces come from Punjab. We fear that there will be short supply of vegetables from Panjab side and if the situation remains the same, the city will face an acute shortage of vegetables.

Into its third day on Sunday, Kisan Avkash has already witnessed farmers dumping vegetables and milk on streets to hit supplies to urban centres and lead to a rise in prices.Right now, we are clearing the stock we had, but if trucks dont arrive tomorrow as well, prices will definitely go up, said a wholeseller of potatoes and onions. According to him, wholesale prices of both are currently Rs 600 per crate (50kg), making the retail price at around Rs 20 per kg. This will get worse in the coming days. Already, there was no auction of potatoes held today, he said.So far, price of potatoes and onions have not risen, but the price for tomato is already hit. That too, for tomatoes that are mostly damaged, as a result of a poor crop. Earlier, we used to buy a crate (25 kg) at Rs 30. Now, it has gone up to Rs 300, said a wholeseller for tomatoes. As a result, price of tomato has gone up as almost 100%.Vegetable associations said the price hike is not necessarily because of the strike. Most of the produce at Gurugram mandi doesnt come from parts where farmers are on strike. Potato prices could have increased because cold storages have started stocking up in anticipation.Till recently, vegetables were arriving in excess from areas around Gurugram.That has now fallen, with stock now coming from places further away, adding to transportation cost, said Inder Thakran , president of Gurugram Sabzi Mandi Association.At a retail store in Sikanderpur, retailers said the supply is still the same. The strike has had no impact here, as most of our vegetables come from nearby areas such as Pataudi, Rajasthan, etc, said the store manager at Haryana Kisan Mandi Zone Fresh near Bristol Chowk.However, sellers at the mandi said prices of some vegetables, like French beans, bell peppers and even mangoes, could rise if the strike continues. They added that rising prices could be profitable for them. We get less to sell, but can charge more in profits, said a seller, not wishing to be named.Mangoes have already seen a Rs 15-20 per kg rise, after the rate had dropped around two weeks ago.Authorities at the mandi said not much will change unless strikers start obstructing transport that brings in the vegetables to the city, or if the strike spreads to nearby areas.The recent hike is not because of the strike. Some vegetables cant be procured locally. Sellers here have to buy them from Azadpur mandi in Delhi, said Thakran, referring to bell peppers and French beans."

It is sad how farmers, vegetable vendors, as well as citizens are facing so many of problems due to the hike in vegetables prices. If vegetables also get expensive as other products in the market, then for a middle-class person, their whole budget gets disturbed, said Deepanjali Bhalla , a housewife.

5b1b27719855b76d570379f4,The loneliness of Lionel Messi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/football/top-stories/the-loneliness-of-lionel-messi/articleshow/64167670.cms,2018-05-15,,The Times Of India,"It happened in 2014. With just two minutes remaining, hearts ticking faster than the stadium clock, Messi stood over a free kick. The Argentine faithful prayed for the divine to intervene. It seemed improbable from that distance or width. But it was a sort of moment when miracles happen, dreams come true.The hopes were dashed a moment later.Four years ago, it could have been Lionel Messis night of redemption, glory, fulfilment and maybe even peace. But 1-0 down against Germany, he failed to seize the day.There was a more earthly opportunity earlier, but Messi had rolled the ball wide.The fans wondered: Would he have scored if he was in a Barcelona jersey? The thought was irrelevant, but damning. For, Messi is condemned to bear the cross. He is Atlas Telamon, the enduring Atlas for whom the Golden Ball for Best Player was a burden because his best on the day was not good enough.It would be crossing many lines to place his predicament in such Biblical or mythical proportions. In fact, an Argentine football club recently recreated the Sistine Chapel on the ceiling of its gymnasium, with Diego Maradona as God and Lionel Messi as Adam, although the latters genius on field can sometimes make us forget his tortured soul.Barcelona may have his heart but Argentina has his soul. You read in a Guardian blog that his accent remains Rosarino, his favourite actor is Ricardo Darin and his favourite food is his mothers milanesas with tomato and cheese.Messis wedding last year in his hometown may not have been as simple as his tastes, so do his tax records, but give him a football and the real meaning of jogo bonito comes alive.Possibly there is Cristiano Ronaldo pushing him to the edge and beyond, the sound of broken records and numbing numbers. The endless stats, comparisons, full-page analysis are there for people to gobble, but there is something intangible. A rose doesnt compete with another rose, it simply blooms. There is simplicity, honesty, flavour, joy, intuition, playfulness. It is as though time doesnt exist.And yet time is ticking, ticking away for Messi, all of 30 now.The agony was palpable when a crouched Leo, wallowing in despair, hand on head, chose to call it quits. Having been beaten by Chile in the 2016 Copa America Centenario final, Messis moist eyes conveyed his journey was in vain. He could almost taste the trophy before it was snatched away, before he sent the penalty into heaven. Feeling responsible, he walked away shedding his cloak as Argentinas deliverer. Maybe, he can get back to happiness now at his Nou Camp fortress, away from the scrutiny and remarkable blame. And even hatred (news of his statues being vandalized in Argentina is a common story).Yet, love brought him back. The arrival boards at Buenos Aires airport read: No te vayas Lio: Lio, dont go. Despite all the problems in the Argentine federation and the storm within, the outpouring of affection changed the script.The qualification for next months World Cup was purgation. Argentina, who played under three different coaches, were outside the four qualifying spots going into the final match in Ecuador. Jorge Sampaolis team talk was emotional: Messi does not owe the World Cup to Argentina, but football owes the World Cup to Messi.Argentina were struggling to breathe in the high altitude of Quito, falling behind after 37 seconds. But the heros bright attitude and genius changed everything. A hat-trick, completed by an exquisite dink over the goalkeeper, ensured the flight to Russia and escape from ignominy.Now, Messi with his van Gogh beard, stands in front of the jury again. Perhaps, its been a refreshing season at Barcelona, the early ouster from the Champions League a definite blessing for all those Argentines begging for their messiah to be wrapped up in cotton wool. Perhaps, the resurrection will be complete on July 15 at the Luzhniki Stadium and a new Easter Sunday will be celebrated.Or perhaps, he is just human, destined to fall again. He would have touched the stars anyway. The world, maybe, is not meant for one as beautiful as him.Lets celebrate the Man, or the Messiah. Because we are going to miss Messi when hes gone."

All the crops, which he had planted and nurtured with high hopes, were completely destroyed by wild boars.According to Sasidharan Nair, wild boars have been causing huge trouble to the farmers of Thalappattumala  Pullambara regions in the Vamanapuram block for over 18 months. Even after receiving frequent complaints from the farmers, the agriculture department and the forest department havent initiated steps to address their woes.Last February, out of four tonnes of spinach cultivated I got only one and half tonnes. The crops are being damaged by boars during night time. Though we have complained to the authorities, they havent taken any action yet. We are living in a country that gives much importance to animals than humans, said Sasidharan Nair.Another farmer in the region, Radhakrishnan, had grown Paddy in five hectares and could produce only less than 500kg as rest of the crops were destroyed by wild animals.Nellanadu and Thottumpuram wards are other rural areas where the wide boar menace was reported. Plantains, tapioca, colocasia, elephant yam, ginger, and turmeric are the major crops which were destroyed due to animal raids.Shanthakumar, a farmer from Nellanadu, said, The boars mostly attack tuber crops and vegetables including peas, bitter guards, tomatoes etc. Farmers like me used to take farmlands on lease, now we are in crisis, he said.According to the Pullambara panchayat president Azeena Beevi, the panchayat is planning to take on preventive measures to defend the crops from the raids, with the help of Krishi Bhavan. The existing solution with panchayat is BOREP, a pig repellent peptide which can be applied at farms.The solution offered by the panchayat is not sufficient to address the issue, feel the farmers. They demand solar fencing for their land.Thiruvananthapuram wildlife warden Shaji Kumar said, Many cases have been reported in the areas bordering forests regarding the killing of wild boars by the locals. It is a criminal offence and under wild life protection act we will file cases against the locals."

Traders here blame Pakistan governments blanket ban on import of vegetables and soybean from India.A cross-border trader and Federation of Karyana and Dry Fruit Commercial Association president Anil Mehra said, Exporters are left jobless. He said there was apparently no reason behind Pakistan refusing to import vegetables and soybean except that its government had bowed to the diktats of hardliners who did not want to have any relations with India. Not only are we suffering but even labourers and transporters are at loss, said Mehra.A vegetable exporter from Bathinda, Narinder Sharma said, We often talk to our importers in Pakistan, but they are also helpless. They are now buying vegetables at much higher prices than they used to while getting goods from India. He said tomatoes were being sold at around Rs 5 per kg in the wholesale markets in India. Had Pakistan been importing tomatoes, the domestic price would have been more than Rs 20 per kg in wholesale. The Indian government should also take retaliatory action so that Pakistani businessmen also feel the heat of their governments decision, he added.In 2016-17 financial year, the value of exports to Pakistan via Attari ICP was Rs 1,063 crore, which dropped to Rs 744 crore in 2017-18. I cannot comment on the reason for decline of exports to Pakistan through Attari ICP since it is an issue between two countries, commissioner of customs (preventive) Dipak Kumar Gupta told TOI.Giving details of the volume of trade, Attari ICP deputy commissioner Balwinder Singh said India had exported vegetables, cotton/yarn, high density polythene (HDPE), soybean and other items amounting to 2.51 lakh tonnen in 2016-17 in Pakistan while there was no trade of vegetables and soybean to the neighbouring country in 2017-18.Balwinder said overall, they had registered around 30% decline in total exports and around 76% decline in the movement of trucks. He said the Indian imports from Pakistan via ICP registered a minor increase in 2017-18 as compared to the previous year, which also raised the revenue in terms of customs duty. India earned Rs 430.95 crore in customs duty on imports from Pakistan via Attari ICP in 2017-18, up by 77.72% from Rs 242.49 crore in the previous year.In 2016-17, India had imported goods, including dry fruits, dry dates, cement, soda, glass, gypsum rock/powder, aluminium ore and limestone, valued at Rs 2,907 crore from Pakistan via Attari ICP. The value of imports rose by about 17% to Rs 3,403 crore in 2017-18. However, in 2017-18 there was a minor decline in imports of dry dates, soda, glass, and cement from Pakistan.Sources said Pakistan had deliberately banned import of Indian perishable goods to dent the Indian economy and cause resentment among the farming community. As expected, farmers suffered (due to ban). A lot of tomato growers had dumped their produce on roads and staged demonstrations last year. Tomato was otherwise exported to Pakistan via Attari, they said.The foundation stone of Indias first ICP at Attari was laid by former Union home minister P Chidambaram on February 20, 2010, and it was later inaugurated by him on April 13, 2012."

Devyani Pandey who has a Lhasa Apso says, ""I keep my dog inside my house and dont let it go outside even to the porch. In the morning, when I go running, I take it along and post-sunset we go to the park to play. I brush it regularly so that it feels light."" While this is the normal routine for most dog owners, cat people have it a bit more difficult as cats don't like water. Persian cat owner Vivek Kumar says, ""Since my cat has long fur, I get it trimmed during summer. I keep a pack of ice under its bed and keep its bed near the cooler. I wipe it occasionally with a wet sponge and then dry and brush its hair. I also make sure that it drinks plenty of water after every meal."" Guinea pig owner Jahanvi Bhushan Mishra feeds her pet snacks that are high in water content. ""My guinea pig does not like to drink much water, so its diet includes plenty of tomatoes, cucumber and watermelon. I dont keep it in its cage the whole day. It roams the house and sleeps under the bed in the afternoon. At night I keep its cage near the air conditioner so it can sleep peacefully.""During summer, zoo keepers have to make special arrangements for the animals. The director of Van Vihar National Park, Samita Rajora says, ""Our aim to keep the animals stress free so they dont fall sick. In their natural habitat they are able to tackle the heat, but here, they are dependent on us. We have created artificial water bodies so that they can take a dip and coolers have been installed too. The traditional way of cooling has been adopted by us. We have put screens made of khus-khus which is kept wet throughout the day. It cools very well. Wet hessian cloth is put on the enclosures as many animals prefer sitting outside.""Dr Brajesh Gupta points out three symptoms to watch out for in your pets. If they stop eating and sleep the whole day, or start vomiting or have loose stools. When these symptoms are noted, the pet should be taken to a vet. He shares, ""Animals are prone to heat stroke, so pet owners should give them special care. They should be given fresh food and water. Snimals like cats and dogs can be given curd which will help them with digestion. If you are traveling with your pets, make sure that they are kept at a stable temperature. Dont bathe them often as then their fur will lose its shine and the threat of tics will increase.""To help stray animals, Bhopalis are keeping bowls filled with grains and water outside their houses. Animal activist Swati Gaurav says, ""We have successfully placed cement containers through which the animals can quench their thirst. We are also planning to build permanent containers on the outskirts of the city which the highway animals can access.""- Farzana Patowari"

Thanks to a glut in the market and the steepest price drop witnessed in April in nearly a decade, tomatoes have become cheaper than even fodder. Tomato farmers claim they are getting just Rs 2 for every kg of produce, which does not even cover harvesting costs.Usually, tomato prices peak during April because of short supply due to high temperatures. However, statistics available with the Agricultural Marketing Information Network (AGMARKNET) show that the April-2018 prices are the lowest for the vegetable during this month in the past eight years. The tomato glut is evident in the Pune wholesale market as well, where 10 kg of the vegetable is available for between Rs 30 and Rs 80.Shriram Gadhave, the president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India , said this is the first time in several years that prices have hit such a low, almost 60% less than the same period last year. The water table has surged thanks to the rains last year, causing a supply surplus. The prices of many vegetables have dropped because of a glut in markets. Cattle owners in the city and nearby villages have now started taking large quantities of tomatoes and other vegetables left unsold to feed to cattle, he said.ND Ghule, assistant secretary, Agricultural Produce Market Committee, Pune, said the increase in tomato supplies led to a drop in prices. Vegetables such as tomato, eggplant and leaves of beetroot and cauliflower are in demand among them as they have become dirt cheap, he further said.The cattle farmers sometimes take 40 tonnes, or more, at a time for free to feed their cattle, added Sunil Kumbharkar, who owns a vegetable wholesale firm in Market Yard.Ramesh Jadhav, a farmer from Malegaon, says he does not know what to do with his 16-acre tomato plantation. Farmers, who are yet to harvest their tomato crops, are letting cattle loose on their fields so that at least they can be consumed by animals. For the first time in years, the per kilogram price we are getting for tomatoes has plummetted to Rs 2, which does not even meet the harvesting cost, he said. Last year, tomato prices had peaked during April, which is why farmers had sown more tomatoes this year, he said."

The White House had said the setting would serve as a reminder of France's ""unique status"" as America's first ally.Trump ended his first year without receiving a foreign leader on a state visit, making him the first president in nearly 100 years to do so and heightening the stakes for Tuesday.Dinner tickets are typically highly sought after by Washington's political and business elite. A few inklings of who's in and who's out already are known: Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, is in, as are House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky was invited, but his office said he is unable to attend.In a break with tradition, Trump invited no Democratic members of Congress or journalists, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the arrangements. But at least one Democrat will be in the crowd: the office of Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards confirmed his attendance.Approximately 150 guests will take their seats in the State Dining Room on Tuesday, making for a more intimate affair than those held by President Barack Obama. Obama's guest lists numbered into the hundreds, requiring that the event be held in a tented pavilion erected on the South Lawn because no room in the White House can accommodate that many people.Most of the responsibility for executing a flawless celebration falls to the first lady and her staff, including such key details as what is served (Trump likes wedge salads and chocolate cake) and poured into glasses (Trump wine?), who sits next to whom, who performs after dinner and what the decor looks like.One big moment is the first glimpse of the first lady in her gown. Fashion details are kept secret until the first couple steps on to the North Portico on Tuesday night to welcome their dinner guests.Former first lady Michelle Obama often used state dinners to showcase the talent of up-and-coming designers. Some designers have cited Trump's politics in refusing to dress the current first lady, a former model. Still, a likely choice would be Dior, the French design house whose fashions Mrs. Trump often wears, or Herve Pierre, the French-American who designed her inaugural gown and other looks.The last time a Republican president hosted his French counterpart was November 2007 when President George W. Bush welcomed the newly divorced Nicolas Sarkozy.More than 100 guests feasted on lobster bisque, lamb with tomato fondue, green beans and sweet potato casserole, salad and dessert served in the State Dining Room. Among the guests were major league baseball pitcher Tom Glavine, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, French chef Guy Savoy and several Louisiana politicians.After dinner, guests strolled down the hall to the East Room to watch performers in the roles of Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette, the Frenchman who served on Washington's staff in the Continental Army. Sarkozy toured Mount Vernon the following day.When Macron's limousine first pulls up the White House driveway on Tuesday morning, Trump, the first lady, White House and administration officials, and hundreds of invited guests will be waiting on the South Lawn. The pomp-filled arrival ceremony is for the man who became the youngest president in French history when he was elected in 2017 at age 39 on his first run for office.The visit also offers Macron his first Oval Office meeting and a joint White House news conference with Trump. There's also a State Department lunch hosted by Vice President Mike Pence before Macron and his wife arrive for the state dinner.The Trump-Macron relationship appeared to get off to a bumpy start with a white-knuckler of a handshake when the political novices met for the first time at a NATO summit in Brussels last May. But Macron likely sealed the bond after Trump accepted his invitation to attend the annual Bastille Day military parade in the center of Paris in July. Macron and his wife also took Trump and the first lady on a tour of Napoleon's tomb and whisked them up into the Eiffel Tower for dinner overlooking the City of Light. The experience led Trump to order up a military parade for downtown Washington later this year.But the two part company on some significant issues, including the Paris climate accord, which Trump withdrew the U.S. from last year, and the Iran-nuclear deal, another multinational agreement that Trump is itching to pull out of. The president did successfully rally Macron and British Prime Minister Theresa May, with whom Trump has sparred, to mount a joint military operation against Syria in response to an apparent chemical attack this month that killed Syrian civilians. Macron still worries about Trump's desire to remove U.S. troops from Syria.An art lover who speaks good English, Macron is known to watch what he eats. Yet he told reporters at an agricultural fair in Paris in February that ""I drink wine at lunch and dinner.""Discerning his tastes, including likes and dislikes, even allergies, is one of the first things the White House tries to pin down for all guests, said Bernard.""You're really focused on making sure the guest feels special,"" he said.Mrs. Trump's social secretary, Rickie Niceta, came aboard last year after two decades of event planning for a caterer whose clients included the White House, the State Department and several embassies, in addition to working on the past five presidential inaugurations, including Trump's. The first lady, who speaks French, also has experienced hands running the kitchen, pastry shop and florist's lair. All three women helped execute more than a dozen state dinners for Obama.Trump owns hotels, including one near the White House, and knows about good hospitality.Bernard recalled that, just as invitations were about to go out for the 2014 dinner for then-French President Francois Hollande, news broke that Hollande and his longtime girlfriend had abruptly split. Mrs. Obama's staff anxiously sought clarity on whether Hollande would bring another date.He didn't, and Bernard dealt with the awkwardness of the situation by seating Hollande between the two Obamas."
5b1b5f7d9855b76d57039795,"Popping pills to cure acidity often? Don’t, advise doctors",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/popping-pills-to-cure-acidity-often-dont-advise-doctors/articleshow/63885556.cms,2018-04-24,,The Times Of India,"PATNA: Medical experts have cautioned people against popping anti-acidity pills without medical prescription, especially during the summer.According to health experts, high temperature causes stomach related issues or digestive ailments. In a bid to find quick relief, people buy anti-acidity drugs, often the most potent ones, over the counter, which is a dangerous trend.The process of digestion involves the breakdown of food through the hydrochloric acid, which is naturally present in stomach. Health experts said frequent use of anti-acidity drugs can neutralize the effect of hydrochloric acid produced naturally by the stomach and alter the entire process of digestion. This can also cause kidney damage and osteoporosis.Regular use of such drugs without the supervision of professionals can alter the absorption of important elements like zinc, iron and chromium. The production of digestive enzymes will be hampered and, in the worst case, it can lead to kidney damage, said city-based physician Dr Diwakar Tejashwi.According to medical experts, anti-acidity drugs are mainly of three types  stomach acid neutralisers, or antacids that provide quick relief in the short term; H2 blockers that provide relief for up to 12 hours by inhibiting histamine, the stimulus for acid production in the stomach; and PPIs that produce greater acid suppression by preventing the acid from being secreted into the stomach.Doctors have advised people to prefer natural eatables like bananas, melons and coconut water to avoid the chances of acidity during the hot days. Dr Ramesh Kumar, a gastroenterologist at All India Institute of Medical Sciences AIIMS ), Patna, said the main reason behind stomach related ailments during summer was consumption of substandard edibles from roadside eateries.Water and food-borne bacterial infections, especially amoebic dysentery and diarrhoea, increase manifold during this time of the year. The major symptoms of such diseases are vomiting, food poisoning, loss of appetite, dehydration, constipation, heartburn, bloating and low blood pressure. To avoid such risks, one can avoid eating fried food items, cheese and the ones containing citric acids like tomatoes, tea, colas, coffee, as it can cause heartburn, Dr Ramesh said.He added small precautions can curb the risk of such diseases. Eating stale food, irregular meals and overeating can often lead to indigestion. Keep well hydrated and look for mineral water which contains bicarbonate as this aids digestion and reduces acidity, advised Dr Ramesh.According to general physician at AIIMS-Patna, Dr Ravi Kirti, mild digestion syrups can be taken in case of extreme restlessness as they protect the stomach lining and provide instant comfort to unbearable gastric symptoms. One should carry rehydrating salts before moving out in sun, by adding six teaspoons of sugar and half teaspoon of salt to a litre of water. Instead of relying on medicines, people should consume seasonal fruits and vegetables to keep their stomachs happy, Dr Kirti said."

Over the years, she came across many people, especially leprosy patients, with open sores and was determined to alleviate their suffering. Last Sunday, Angelin launched Wound Care On Wheels, an initiative wherein she and her team will clean and dress the wounds of those living on the streets.We will be taking dressing materials like betadine, gauze, gloves and approach people in need of help. We will get their permission before we do the dressing, says Angelin, director of The Candles that works in the field of mental and physical health. Along with a couple of colleagues, I will be visiting areas between Purusawalkam and Broadway , she says, adding that the team will start work from Friday and will be visiting the areas twice a week, as dressing needs to be changed.The Candles runs several projects, including awareness programmes on menstrual hygiene in schools and colleges across TN. As part of their project, Amudha Surabhi, the organisation gives health mix porridge to government school children. Feeding the homeless is part of their Share With Care programme. We distribute food thrice a month in the areas between Anna Nagar and Broadway. We get parotta and kurma or idlis from hotels, says Angelin. Or our volunteers cook vegetable or tomato rice.And thats when they came across people on the streets who needed medical aid. Many of them have wounds that are not bandaged properly or are covered with dirty rags, says Angelin. They are hesitant to go to a government hospital as they have to wait in long queues. We did do dressing for a few people but then thought we should have a sustained programme. Angelin, who has done a diploma in hand and leprosy physiotherapy, prefers to use the term Hansens disease instead of leprosy. Stigma still exists around the word leprosy, she says.At the moment, they will be using their own bikes to get around. We are looking for donors who can help us with basic medical supplies or an autorickshaw for us to go around, says Angelin. Psychologist Dr Mini Rao, who has been involved with the NGO for several years says, Many still hesitate to interact with people with leprosy. This initiative will touch several lives."

The spicy mix traditionally comes in a scooped-out potato cup (kulle) but vendors are now experimenting with fruits, tomato and cucumber as the base. Made popular by food walks, this new avatar of kulle chaat is lapped up by tourists and shoppers in Chawri Bazaar and Sitaram Bazaar, but Purani Dilli frowns on these upstarts who have tinkered with the original.How can you make kulle with tomato? agonises Ashok Mathur , 48, a fifth-generation Old Delhi resident, who has grown up eating Sultans Kulle in his neighbourhood. Kulle used to be only made of aloo or shakarkandi (sweet potato). The spicier, the better! This was followed by a cup of tea, Mathur recounts, sitting in his 100-year-old home in Roshanpura.Arun Kashyap , 32, sits at the same spot where his great grandfather, Sultan Singh, parked himself on a raised platform outside a Jain household, in a narrow bylane that runs parallel to Nai Sadak Kashyap says he has grown up hearing tales of the legendary Mukesh  the singers family lived in Old Delhis Chelpuri  eating kulle made by his great grandfather when he was a roaming hawker with a khomcha (stand).Banana was the first fruit our family experimented with for customers who liked fruit chaat but didnt want the traditional aloo as the base for kulle. Now, we make it with more fruits but the regulars insist on aloo, says Kashyap, who also serves aloo chaat and tikki.The aloo is sand-baked at a bhatti in the Old Subzi Mandi area in the morning. By afternoon it reaches Roshanpura, where Kashyap scoops out the middle to make space for the filling.He starts with a few pinches of a homemade masala which, Kashyap says, has 36 ingredients. This is followed by boiled chana (small chickpeas), kala namak, roasted jeera powder, black pepper, boora (powdered sugar), pomegranate seeds, a squeeze of lemon and finally topped with sliced ginger.This was a vantage point when Sultan set up base here 80 years ago; but changing demography and competition from chaat vendors on the main roads, have made life tough for his great grandson.But support from the local community has kept Sultans kulle going. We use the space outside a Jain familys house but they dont charge us. They let us store our wares inside, and even pay for the kulle they consume, says Kashyap.His chaat still draws members of the Mathur families, who once occupied most houses in this neighbourhood. Today, the homes have given way to shops and godowns. Sultans masala runs in our blood, says Ashok Mathur, talking nostalgically about how people used to choke the lane during Ramlila celebrations to relish the kulle served on dhak patta.So, next time you take Nai Sadak to cross over from the food streets of Chandni Chowk to Jama Masjid , do try out this palate cleanser."

Unable to recover even the production cost, distressed farmers are dumping the produce in fields and on roads in Sehore, Narsinghpur and Raisen districts.Market reports disclosed price of tomato crashed to Re 1 and even 50 paisa per kg in some districts forcing farmers to seek government intervention. Reports from Sehore - the home district of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Narsinghpur and Raisen- reveal price variation is hitting farmers hard.In Budhni (Sehore) and Gadarwara (Narsinghpur) dumping of tomato on the roadside has become a common sight. Tomato growers said there was a glut in the market as more farmers took to its cultivation, . Moreover, a slump in demand in neighbouring states also contributed to the crash in price. Farmers in more than a 12-13 districts cultivated tomato on a large scale, resulting in lesser demand for tomatoes, they said.""In August-September last year, farmers sold tomatoes for as high as Rs 50 to Rs 70 per kg due to high demand. Now, the price has crashed to 50 to 60 paisa a kg in the wholesale market, which is less than the production cost. But in retail, the crop is being sold for Rs 10 per kg. Farmers are compelled to dump tomatoes on roadside as a mark of protest,"" said a farmer of Gadarwara.In Nasarullaganj and Shahganj - the two main areas under the assembly constituency of the chief minister- farmers are not even able to recover transportation cost. Mahesh , a farmer from Shahganj claimed in a field of two acre, he spent Rs 10,000 on seeds, Rs 9,000 on pesticides, Rs 3,000 on irrigation and Rs 50,000 on labour. But, could not recover the cost for which he had drawn a bank loan of Rs 5 lakh. Minister of state for agriculture Balkrishna Patidar said those who are dumping tomatoes on roadside are not farmers, but protesters. Farmers never dump their hard-earned produce. Farmers know well the price fluctuation. Otherwise they would not have opted for tomato crop, the minister said.""The demonstrations are planned and farmers are not involved in dumping of their produce. Price fluctuation is a normal process. At times, farmers had earned Rs 50 per kg, when there was a demand. Now, they have to sell it at a lesser margin. Had farmers not earned benefit last year, they would not have opted for the same crop this year,"" Patidar told TOI."

The market authorities claim that the area is cleaned twice a day.The garbage bins are almost overflowing and even the space outside the shops is littered with leftovers. Rotting vegetables and fruits seems to be scattered on the road. During a visit to the grain market on Tuesday, the TOI team found few of the shopkeepers dumping rotten tomato and potato in the open and on the streets. Due to this, the passersby and customers looking for vegetables and fruits were facing a lot of problems. The market's roadsides were full of dirt, junk material, and garbage.Some of the vendors had pitched their carts on the muddy patches and their vegetables and fruits witnessed had dirt all over. And many people were buying these items, too. To the naked eye, these items seemed injurious to health. The loading and unloading of trucks was in progress on the main road inside the market, which had jammed this passage.Vegetable peels flies into the eyes of the customers and commuters. Even many of the shopkeepers sitting in the ground were found to be uncomfortable because of the stinking environment they had created themselves. Dustbins in the market had not been emptied in days. Most of these were either broken or not in a usable condition. Encroachment around the main gate and the inside main road was rampant. Rows and rows of trucks occupied the middle of the road. The other vehicles didn't have space to even squeeze past.Sector-26 grain market secretary M K Sharma said: ""Every day, we collect garbage in the trollies. This problem recurs after every spell of rain and we had been facing it for the past many years. All problems stem from the disorderly traffic. One of the alternatives is to shift the grain market to Sector 39. Because of the crowd, we are unable to collect waste from each corner. This waste is dumped outside the city. The marked generates waste in bulk indeed.""Bablu, a shopkeeper at the grain market, said: ""This market is cleaned twice a day but most of the shopkeepers chuck their waste on to the road and litter the interior areas as well. Even though they are responsible for the problem, most of the big shopkeepers do not accept their responsibility or behave in a disciplined manner.""The customers at the market attributed many problems to all the dirt, garbage, and unpleasant smell generated from the place. Sector 28 resident Sheetal Chaturvedi said: ""The market doesn't have toilet facilities. The MC officials and the market committee have not taken appropriate steps for the improvement of civic facilities in the area."""

With market forces, particularly commission agents, influencing prices in the regulated markets, farmers often struggled to get remunerative prices. In fact, tomato growers throwing their dumping their produce during peak season has become a routine affair. During these events, farmers blamed the traders syndicate.After carefully studying the situation, the state government issued a GO de-notifying vegetables and fruits from Andhra Pradesh Markets (agriculture produces and livestock) Act. The de-notification will reduce the price gap between producers and consumers through reduction in intermediary supply chain and creation of alternative marketing channels, said agriculture minister Somireddy Chandramohan Reddy . He said it would also promote investment on development of marketing infrastructure with private sector participation.The move is expected to bring down the prices in the retail market as growers are free to sell the stocks anywhere in the state besides enhancing farmers profit.

5b1c4d3e9855b74aba67c3b9,Reducing post-harvest losses the main challenge: Researchers,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/reducing-post-harvest-losses-the-main-challenge-researchers/articleshow/63405223.cms,2018-03-22,,The Times Of India,"The biggest problem affecting the countrys agriculture and the agricultural market is post-harvest losses, say experts. Annually, the country loses about Rs 2,40,000 crore through the post-harvest wastage of fruits and vegetables, says G J Janavi , head of the department of nano science and technology, TNAU India is the second largest producer of fruits and vegetables, after China. But there are several post-harvest losses from the producer to the consumer, she says. This is because of the lack of proper harvest practices, transportation and cold storage facilities, she adds. She says that around 35% to 40% of fruit and vegetable produce are wasted.The department of nano science and technology at TNAU has been trying to reduce post-harvest losses of fruits at all links of the supply chain, say researchers at the department. While the spraying of Enhanced Freshness Formulation (EFF) on mango trees prior harvest and dipping of mangoes and bananas in EFF solution slows down ripening, and control losses at farm level, researchers have come up with methods to control losses in package houses, transportation and retail shops.The department has devised and patented a technology where EFF is injected into nanofibres, which are coated on a strip of foil or paper or infused in a pellet, which is placed in a fruit carton. The hexanal in the EFF vaporizes, which is imbibed by the fruits, resulting in increased shelf life, says K S Subramanian , professor at the department and the principal investigator of the project.Also, a transparent film made of nano-cellulose extracted from banana fibre, which is infused with EFF, when used as a cover slows down ripening and brings down losses in tomatoes, said Subramanian.We are also working on bringing down losses during transportation. In the vaporization method, hexanal is made to vaporize in a chamber where fruits are kept. This can be done in a truck when the fruits are being carried to long distances, he adds.Farmers say such technologies would help them a lot when they export fruits. It takes 10 days to take fruits by sea to Singapore, 25 for Australia and 28 for the US. If such a technology is used in the container, the losses could be controlled in an easy and effective way, says P Pugazhendhi, 58, from Krishnagiri , who runs a firm which exports fruits."

Balwant, who owns around 40 acre farmland on very tough terrain, is a worried man as the prices of tomatoes have crashed. A vehicle full of tomato crates sent to Kalamna wholesale market was brought back without selling the produce, since it was fetching a very low price of Rs50 a crate, which comes to just Rs2 a kg. The recent weather has weakened the yield and reduced its shelf life, said Balwant, who, left with no option, decided to feed the tomato yield to his cattle.Balwant said it doesnt make sense to sell tomatoes at Rs2 a kg as it does not recover even the basic expenses involved like seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, transportation and commission to agents.Pandurang Tarare, another villager involved in traditional farming, said he too was very depressed when he heard that the rates of tomatoes have gone below Rs50 per crate. He plans to wait another week, otherwise he would also feed the yield to his bullocks. He said the Centre should do something as farmers are facing hardships, especially in Vidarbha region.Shriram Ghadhave, president of Vegetable Growers Association of India (VGAI), said Maharashtra has seen a 10-15% rise in area under cultivation for tomatoes. Previously, farmers from western Maharashtra used to go for vegetable crops but in recent times farmers from Vidarbha and Marathwada too have started growing vegetables. He also attributed this growth to the good rainfall in the state last year. As against 2.5 lakh hectares of tomato cultivation, this year we have about 3 lakh hectares, he said.Lately, farmers have increased cultivation of vegetables as it ensures cash flow in the short term. This takes care of their immediate needs. However, as the number of farmers growing vegetables apart from their main stay crop has increased, it has led to an oversupply as well. Its not only tomato, rates of other vegetables like brinjal, ladyfinger and cauliflower too have gone down throughout the region, said farmers as well as farm activists.Locally grown vegetables, including tomatoes, are fetching a price within Rs2-4 a kg. In some cases, its just a couple of rupees, say market sources.Kishore Tiwari of Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission (VNSSM)  the state government agency to tackle farm crisis  said if its tomatoes in Nagpur, in Yavatmal farmers have ended up in losses in brinjal and ladyfinger.The rates of main crops like soyabean and cotton are already down. Now, there is a slump in vegetables which are grown to supplement income by farmers. There is no system of MSP for vegetables, he said.Farmers having irrigation facilities used to go for crops like wheat or gram. These days, vegetables are being preferred as well. This has led to a glut in Wardha. Farmers are not able to recover expenses in cauliflower cultivation, said Vijay Jawandhia, a former Shetkari Sanghathana activist from Wardha.Vijay Ingle from Akola, a farmer who had bagged state government award for best practices, also confirmed that in his area farmers were setting aside an acre or half for vegetables. The rates are down due to oversupply, he said.Meanwhile, Nandkishore Gaur, president of vegetable traders at Kalamna Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) yard, said rates are expected to increase in the coming months.Tomatoes are reaped for four months, so farmers have a chance to recover their losses. Normally, the crop is grown in the month of October. However, these days large number of farmers in areas like Ramtek and Tumsar Road in Nagpur district have gone for the January crop, which will continue till April. At the same time, there are arrivals from other states like bordering Madhya Pradesh and Telangana as well. The supplies will recede after April, and the rates are expected to increase then, he said."

He had perfected guerilla warfare, both in public and on social media networks, with startling allegations as his preferred ammunition. Politicians feared him, because in this era and time, allegations carry more value.Kejriwal and his colleagues, in early 2016, had hurled an allegation against Shiromani Akali Dal leader Bikram Singh Majithia , who promptly filed a defamation suit. It is far easier to dabble in innuendoes than proving it in a court of law. Cornered by law and litigation, Kejriwal has apologised, albeit two years later. Majithia appears to have accepted the apology and promised to withdraw the defamation case.Are apologies enough to mend damaged reputations? Does delay in tendering apology take away from sincerity and intent behind the regret? What about social media networks, especially Twitter, where all and sundry hurl innuendoes, abuses and allegations like tomatoes in Spains La Tomatina ? Should there be a special law to deal with social media networks? In India, where a dragging defamation case adds salt to wounded reputation, Sections 499 and 500 of IPC (criminal defamation) or a civil suit for damages are no solution to rein in disparaging comments on social media hurled from fake handles. In India, apologies come not from the heart or conviction, but only when the offender gets cornered by litigation or political expediency.For the November 1984 anti-Sikh carnage, it took Congress more than 20 years to issue an apology. Then PM Manmohan Singh had said in 2005, I have no hesitation in apologising to the Sikh community. For the 2002 post-Godhra riots, a formal apology is yet to come though Narendra Modi had said in 2013, Anyway you look at it, it was a shameful blot on the image of Vibrant Gujarat.In legal circles, apologies are not considered an acceptable method to avoid legal consequences in a defamation case, though it may help reduce the rigour of penalty. This is because an apology may assuage hurt but not mend the damaged reputation.Indian constitutional courts, in general, let off a person facing contempt proceedings for disparaging remarks against a judge or judiciary, if the person tenders unqualified and unconditional apology. In defamation cases, an apology reflecting that the offender is sorry and says so publicly helps release the steam. But apology has many hues and contexts  from simply saying sorry to acknowledging the wrongdoing and taking full responsibility for the fallout.In the famous New York Times vs Sullivan case, the US Supreme Court in 1964 imposed a higher standard for a public servant to seek damages against a person who makes defamatory remarks against her/him. Under this standard, public official plaintiff must show that the defendant acted with knowledge that the allegations were false or made with reckless disregard of truth.But 10 years later, the same US SC in Gertz vs Robert Welch refused to extend the same standard to defamation cases involving private individuals, saying they were more vulnerable to injury from defamation. The crux of this judgment was public officials had an opportunity to rebut fallacies, which was not available to private individuals. Last year, UKs High Court of Justice, Queens Bench Division, gave a trend-setting judgment in Jackie Monroe vs Katie Hopkins , which will serve as a lesson for Twitter gladiators with hired troll armies across the world.Monroe sued Hopkins for a disparaging tweet that featured during a war of words over Twitter after the Conservative Party formed government in May 2015 followed by a violent anti-austerity demonstration which vandalised Memorial to the Women of World War II in Whitehall. Indians, who often come across virulently disparaging tweets, will find Hopkinss tweet harmless and ignorable. After vandalisation of the memorial, Hopkins tweeted, @MsJackMonroe scrawled on any memorials recently? Vandalised the memory of those who fought for your freedom. Grandma got any more medals? It was re-tweeted several times and Monroe was trolled heavily. In reply, Monroe tweeted, I have never scrawled on a memorial. Brother in RAF. Dad was a Para in the Falklands. You are a piece of shit.The exchanges thereafter reflected Monroe requesting Hopkins to delete the abusive tweet, followed by a demand for an apology and a donation of 5,000 pounds for charity.Hopkins deleted the tweet two hours later, did not donate, and posted another tweet, Can someone explain to me - in 10 words or less - the difference between irritant @PennyRed and social anthrax @Jack Monroe Monroe sued Hopkins after newspapers published articles on the unsavoury exchange.Hopkins later tried to make amends by posting a tweet, partially on the lines suggested by Monroe, to admit she was confused about the identity and that she got it wrong. Dissatisfied, Monroe continued with the proceedings. The UK HC rejected Hopkinss defence that the tweet was deleted after two hours and had limited public life. It said, Any tweet disappears from readers view as time goes on. But this is a weak point. What matters, when considering transience, is not the period of time for which a person is exposed to the message but the impact the message has. It is a commonplace of experience that live broadcasts can have a powerful impact even if the viewer sees them only once. Print copies of newspapers are not often read more than once.The HC was also unimpressed by Hopkinss I got it wrong tweet shorn of apology and was convinced that she caused serious harm to Monroes reputation. It asked Hopkins, who had not responded to the 5,000 pounds donation demand, to pay 24,000 pounds as damages to Monroe.To check unguided missiles and hired troll armies, Indian courts need to take a leaf out of the UK HCs decision."

The rising temperature has caused a fall in groundwater level and reduced crop yield. The Koyambedu wholesale vegetable market, which used to receive 400-450 truckloads of vegetables every day three months ago, received only 350 loads on Friday.In three months, the price of green beans has gone up from Rs15-Rs20 per kg to Rs30-Rs50 per kg at the Koyambedu market. At neighbourhood retail stores, green beans was selling for Rs60 per kg on Friday.Yield from the years second crop (April to June) is 30% less than the yield from first crop which is harvested from December to March. Prices of tomato, beetroot, cauliflower, radish and turnip have increased by about 30%, while prices of onion, sambar onion, capsicum and brinjal have decreased marginally. Prices of all vegetables will rise from the third week of April by 10%, according to Koyambedu Wholesale Traders Welfare Association treasurer P G M Sukumar.Sukumar said, Prices began to go up from the first week of March last year due to a failed monsoon. This year, however, prices will only rise gradually, thanks to sufficient rainfall. Except for coastal Andhra, all other parts of the southern peninsula registered normal rainfall during the recent northeast monsoon.Prices of tomato in April last year was Rs18, while this year it is only Rs10-Rs12. Likewise, the price of carrot was Rs35 last year compared to Rs15-Rs20 this year."

But for the bulk orders, we have to make eight-ten packages at a time, which is very time consuming. Business has slowed down by 40% due to this, said vendor Hazrat Haldewale Meanwhile, several vendors have alternatively started stocking cloth bags worth Rs 10 or Rs 20, depending on size, although the move has not yet worked out in their favour. Customers will not purchase a bag worth Rs 10 to carry greens worth Rs 20. People must also be advised by the government to carry bags from home, said vendor Hyder Ali.While vegetable vendors are still managing to function, those who sell of pulses and grains are in bigger trouble. The government should have thought of an alternative for businesses like ours. We approached the CCP and they said to charge people for paper bags. Doing that will further decrease our customers, since they will prefer to go to the mall and buy readymade packets of rice instead of coming to the market. We have already seen a 45% decrease in profits after the ban, said vendor Nitin Mandrekar Many others, however, are very optimistic about this change. Miramar-resident Joseph Ferrao said, In olden days we used to carry our own bag to the market. Now, that good practice is making a comeback.We sell high-value vegetables like cherry tomatoes whose cost goes up in hundreds per kilogram. Customers dont mind paying an extra Rs 10 to purchase a cloth bag. We make Rs 5 on the bag, so the ban has actually worked in our favour, said vendor Sadiq Shaikh.Naomi M from Pilerne said, The services of some self-help groups must be utilised to make and provide newspaper bags. They are very common in Mumbai and the practice can be adopted here as well. The vendors can charge a nominal amount for it. This way, plastic bags are replaced, paper is recycled and someone gains employment."

When I checked the root, it looked as if it had galls. Galls are knot-like structures caused by root-knot nematodes. But, we were not sure about it as root-knot nematodes in citrus were not present in Tamil Nadu, she said.Poornima visited the farm and dug up a live sapling. We found that the sapling was infected with root-knot nematodes. In the past few months, we found instances of root-knot nematode infections in citrus saplings in farms in Coimbatore and Erode districts. Researchers here are working on battling the nematode, she said.Nematodes enter the roots of fruit, vegetable and flower saplings through the root tip. After two to three months, they breed and block the conducting vessels of the plant, causing it to wilt. Root-knot nematodes, meanwhile, enter the roots, where they lay eggs, which form knot-like structures that bulge out of the root. The knots then rupture and the young nematodes go in search of new roots.Nematodes mainly affect fruit and vegetable crops such as tomato, guava, pomegranate, cucumber and capsicum, said Poornima. Tomato and cucumber plants are the major victims, she added.There are also instances where there have been heavy losses in guava, said the head of nematology department, S Subramanian. Over the past four to five years, several new varieties of guava were introduced in the state. They have been affected by nematodes and have caused severe losses to farmers, he added. The annual loss in fruit crops due to nematodes was pegged at 13%, he said.The department has been researching how to tackle the nematode menace and also has been helping farmers and nursery owners. Beneficial fungi such as Paecilomyces and Pochonia are known to inhibit nematode growth, said Poornima. We have been producing the fungi and selling it to farmers. The fungi can be mixed with soil or the saplings can be dipped in the liquid formation of the fungi before being planted. Also, simple methods such as exposing the soil to sunlight will kill nematodes, she added.The department has been conducting awareness workshops on nematodes for both farmers and nursery owners, Poornima added."

According to police, Dalia used to siphon off the daily collections of Mirch Masala and the royalty amount of Tomatos.A police official said that to show the siphoned off money in books of accounts, Dalia made duplicate fixed deposit receipts and forged bank statements to show them to the owners. Police sources said that Dalia even forged signatures of the owners of the company and increased overdraft limit to Rs 90 lakh. Dalia withdrew Rs 87 lakh through overdraft facility and kept the owners in dark. Police said that the accused indulged in fraudulent activities since 2011 which came to light in September 2016 when the owners asked him to transfer Rs 36 lakh from the fixed deposit to Ahmedabad. The company wanted the money to buy furniture for its new restaurant in Ahmedabad.According to police complaint filed by the CMD of AHPL Rushad Ginwala , the scam had come to light when Dalia did not transfer the money for several days and stopped answering calls. When the companys account manager and general manager approached Corporation Bank in the city, they learnt that no fixed deposits were made, instead the company owes Rs 87 lakh to the bank which were withdrawn by Dalia as overdraft.Officials at Gotri police station said that Dalia was on run for 18 months and was nabbed on Friday. On Saturday, a judicial magistrates court sent him to police custody for eight days for investigation."

The initiative was conceived earlier this year by teachers to encourage students to be senitive to the environment.The school has started an eco-club and roped in students as members. Manoj Kumar, head teacher, said, I joined the school nine months ago. At that time, there was not a single plant in the school. So, we asked students to go to neighbouring areas and collect old plants.Students managed to collect at least 170 plants in a week after which the school got in touch with Give me trees, a Delhi-based NGO which focuses on community-based voluntary tree planting and conservation. The trust asked us if hydroponic plantation could be introduced in the school and we agreed to do the same, said Kumar.Give me trees roped in Honda, which donated Rs 3.5 lakh from its CSR funds for the project. Vaneet Bhalla, a volunteer with Give me trees, said, The concept of hydroponics is new in the country but it gives big results. It involves growing healthy plants without the use of a traditional soil medium, using a nutrient and mineral-rich water solution. Hydroponic plantation requires less water in comparison to the traditional way. A hydroponic plant needs some nutrients, water, and sunlight and all this is available in the school.The school chose its rooftop to set up the garden. The plants are put on pipes. This requires less space as the plants grow vertically, said Bhalla.Students look after the plants. Vegetables such as cabbage, capsicum, green chilli, ladys finger and tomato are grown. When the vegetables are fully grown, we will distribute them among students, said Kumar.The system requires the school to ensure water circulation through hydroponic pipes. The school makes two teachers stay in the school overnight to switch on the motor when water supply is there. The school has eight teachers. We dont have helpers such as gardeners or guards. So, we decided to take care of this ourselves. We stay in the school to switch on the motor in the evening and early morning. We also sprinkle organic pesticides on the plants, said Manjeet Mann , a teacher.The school plans to increase the number of hydroponic plants to 3,500 in the next couple of days. Sub-divisional magistrate Sanjeev Singhla said, I really appreciate the work students have done to grow soil-less plants. Other schools should also encourage this initiative."

Prices of regular varieties like rohu, katla, tangra and pabda have shot up by Rs 75-150 a kg following a surge in demand.While fish has always been a part of the daily diet of an average Bengali household, now even other communities, who prefer meat for their dietary needs, have suddenly discovered their love for fish. In Bengali households where mutton and chicken dishes usually figure on the Sunday menu, it has been fish all the way these past couple of weeks.Not just homes, even restaurants and caterers have reported a shift from mughlai, continental and Chinese cuisines to Bengali that has a wide variety of fish dishes on the menu.Price of fish across categories has gone up by 17-20% in the wholesale market. It is a record high. We have never traded fish at this price, said Howrah Wholesale Fish Market Association secretary Syed Anwar Maqsood.The rise in fish prices in the wholesale market has translated to an even steeper hike in retail prices, but the demand surge has not led to a supply shortage. State fisheries minister Chandrakanta Sinha confirmed there was enough supply in the market to meet the demand. Yet, prices have continued to soar.At municipal markets in Gariahat, Lake Market, New Market and Manicktala, price of katla has shot up from Rs 240 a kg a couple of weeks ago to Rs 350-400. Rohu has gone up from Rs 130 to Rs 160-170.Market observers put the sharp hike in prices to opportunism at the retail end. A retail fish seller senses the demand and accordingly hikes the price to maximise his profit. That is whats happened, said Jagannath Raut of Behala wholesale fish market.Caterers are having a harrowing time with clients demanding major changes in the menu at the 11th hour. According to Sandip Das of Diamond Caterer, mutton and chicken items have nearly disappeared from the menu. Now everyone is demanding that meat items be replaced by fish and prawn. This has thrown the costing of dishes haywire, said Das.We are reinventing a lot of fish dishes to stay afloat, said Sujoy Ghosh of Bhawanipores Ghosh Caterers. Reshmi kebab and mutton do peyazja have been replaced with prawn cutlet and fish coriander. Baked tomato betki has edged out roast mutton.In restaurants, too, fish and prawn items are moving faster than usual. Peter Cat and Mocambo owner Nitin Kothari said the slump in demand for chicken and mutton items was significant.Metro Cash and Carry, the leading business-to-business wholesaler that supplies both meat and fish to most big hotels and restaurants in the city, has also experienced a sharp rise in demand for fish."

Apart from coriander, cauliflower too has gone beyond the reach of middle class families, putting extensive pressure on household budgets. On the other hand, prices of the most consumed vegetables like tomato, onion, brinjal, and okra have gone down due to surplus growth of the crops in farms across northern India.Joginder Singh, one of the vendors in the citys busiest vegetable market, said due to bad weather conditions across the northern parts of the country, vegetable prices may increase in the coming days, but at present, the prices of most consumed vegetables are under control, and so people were satisfied with the prices. However, prices of a few other vegetables continued to remain high, as they are mostly transported from far-off places.Another vendor, Shambu Parsad, said due to lower vegetables prices of the most consumed vegetables, vendors were facing hardship dealing with their daily needs. One of the reasons behind the price increase of healthy vegetables like broccoli, peas, and capsicum was due to the fact that they are mostly grown in cold places, so as winter ends, the prices shoot up.Meanwhile, residents  especially women  who have to run their kitchens were not much upset, as the prices of most vegetables were not very high these days. Dilpreet Kaur stated: Green vegetables are still far from the reach of middle class families, as the central government has no policy to control their prices, so that even middle class families can consume them without any hesitation.RETAIL PRICESVegetablePrices in April last weekPrices in May first weekPrices at presentCoriander80-9090-100100-120Onion35-4030-3525-30Broccoli80-9090-100100-110Capsicum (red, yellow)60-7070-80100-120Bitter melon40-5035-4020-25Okra40-5035-4030-35Tomato40-5030-4025-30"

Three months on, they have some reason to cheer. Wholesale potato prices now range from Rs 9 to Rs 22 a kilogram and are not expected to slide anytime soon. As demand rises, market experts feel prices will rise further, by up to 60%.One reason is that the quantity of potatoes in cold storage is currently 20% less than last year. Officials said that potatoes are currently commanding higher prices than onions and tomatoes. The wholesale price of onions currently ranges between Rs 3.50 and Rs 9 per kilogram, while tomatoes are selling for between Rs 6 and Rs 9 a kilogram.Potato prices have been rising for a fortnight and market officials believe they will climb further. We are seeing wide fluctuations in the wholesale market. Any tightening of supply will raise prices further, says Deepak Patel , secretary of the Ahmedabad Agricultural Produce Market Committee.Market officials met traders who said prices will not rise if demand remains at the same level, Patel said.Ashish Guru, president of the Gujarat Cold Storage Association , says, There are at least one crore 50-kg bags fewer at cold storages in Gujarat compared to 2017. Further, Uttar Pradesh, a major potato producing state, has registered a fall in production. Farmers have not been getting remunerative prices for their produce and have hence moved away potato to more lucrative crops.Guru said the Gujarat government last year gave Rs 40 as subsidy to potato farmers. Only 4.09 crore 50-kg bags have been stored this year. The number was 5.10 crore bags in 2017. Cold storage capacity in the state is 5.75 crore bags.Guru said the drop in potato production this year has brought some relief to farmers at the cost of higher prices for consumers.According to potato traders, farmers in major potato producing states collectively reduced the acreage sown with the tuber last year by 5% to 7%, after two straight years of gluts in the market. The reduced acreage has led to a 10% to 20% fall in potato output."

The farmers from Kaladera, Chomu, Behror, Lalsot and other nearby places are coming to the city in droves. The glut has led to a dip in the price of several veggies, said Rahul Tanwar, president of Muhana fruit and vegetable wholesale sellers association.He added that prices of tomatoes have dropped from Rs 20 to Rs 6-8 per kilogramme in a span of three days. Earlier, there was a farmers agitation which affected the veggie supply to the city; many farmers were also not able to sell their produces in mandi. There was a general assumption that there is a shortage in the city, hence, farmers from nearby areas like Bassi and Kaladera started coming to Muhana to sell their produces, Tanwar said.The dealers told TOI that many of the rural vegetable and fruit shops like in Bassi and Chomu have seen business being affected due to the stir, causing severe losses to the farmers. The temperature is soaring; therefore farmers cannot store their produces for a very long time. If they dont sell vegetables soon, they will have to face losses, said Ajay, a fruit seller at Lal Kothi market.The retailers said that while there is a glut of certain vegetables, the decline in prices wouldnt last long.
