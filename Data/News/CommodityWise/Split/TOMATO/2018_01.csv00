Ltd. is on a mission to regain market share for its flagship Complan brand even as it looks to add more categories, according to a top official.The Indian arm of the Nasdaq-listed food and beverage firm, The Kraft Heinz Company, also owns brands such as Nycil talcum powder, Heinz tomato ketchup, and Sampriti ghee in the Indian market.There are multiple categories in the pipeline as part of our long-term strategy. Our efforts are now focussed on consolidating our position and market share in Complan, said HIPL managing director Sankalp Potbhare in an interaction, declining to comment on future product line-ups.In India, Complan is a 50-year-old brand, offering milk-based nutrition beverage. It was learnt that Complans market share had slipped to single digit for various reasons over the last few years.Bulk of HIPLs (also known as Kraft Heinz) Indian revenues are from Glucon-D (more than 40%), followed by more than 30% from Complan. The rest are from other segments.Mr. Potbhare said that the companys Rs. 6,000-crore milk food drink (MFD) segment comprised brands like Horlicks and Boost, Bournvita and Complan besides some local brands. Tamil Nadu and West Bengal together accounted for 30% of HIPLs MFD market.Changed formulationsSince our re-launch in August 2017, with changed formulations, we have gained in market share. We are looking at a double-digit market share nationally, said Mr. Potbhare, who was here to unveil a campaign with cricketer Sourav Ganguly, whom the company recently signed up as brand ambassador for three years.He was our choice as a legendary sportsperson and as a doting father, he said. The current campaign aims to raise protein awareness across India starting with West Bengal.We are looking at volume growth and market gains, since that makes the business sustainable, Mr. Potbhare said."
5b1538339855b76a5f1a07a0,Fruit of labour eludes farmers,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/fruit-of-labour-eludes-farmers/article23790028.ece,2018-05-06,"Vegetable prices have remained nearly constant for the past decade at Rythu Bazaars, data sourced from Rythu Bazaar website shows. Except for a brief bump in 2017 when tomato prices touched Rs. 85 during summer, the prices have fluctuated in a narrow band of Rs. 6 and Rs. 20, occasionally going up to Rs. 30. What this means for farm income can be easily guessed.Vegetable prices, even for a perishable item like tomatoes, are a product of demand and supply. When both are nearly constant, the price will remain constant. The produce that reaches Hyderabad is not just local. Farmers from far flung districts like Madanapalle, Vizag and Chittoor also get their produce here. That benefits the consumers who pay between Rs. 10 and Rs. 14 per kilo for tomatoes, says B. Babu, Deputy Director, Horticulture Department, Rangareddy.At the Rythu Bazaar in Mehdipatnam, the buzz begins early in the morning with farmers bringing their produce in wicker baskets or neatly packed in colourful plastic tubs. At around 9 a.m., the estate officer goes and with a piece of chalk, marks the prices on the green signboard. It sets off a noisy cacophony as the farmers and traders begin an earnest conversation. As the shoppers troop in, it is business time as the farmers disappear and the traders take charge. I have been bringing my vegetables from Chevella for the past five years. I dont remember getting more than Rs. 10 per kilo for tomatoes. Sometimes, I have sold by number of baskets without being aware of the number of kilos, says Bharat Reddy, who cultivates tomatoes on his one-acre patch.Farm labourThe near-flat vegetable prices have had their impact on farm labour as well, as can been seen from a recent Reserve Bank of India paper Rural Wage Dynamics in India: What Role does Inflation Play? It used farm and non-farm wages as a take off point: There has been a sustained sluggishness in rural wage growth in the more recent period (post 2012-13), with the fall in agricultural wage growth being higher than non-agricultural wages.For agriculture produce, even the cost is not being covered. Last year, there was big buzz about chilli prices. Indias contribution to the world chilli production is 37% with the two Telugu states contributing 57%. The output per acre has remained constant and the sale price has also remained constant for most vegetables aggravating farm sector distress, says Sarampally Malla Reddy of All India Kisan Sabha.Wholesale prices are being dictated by six big corporates who are able to control the price as they are the main canalising agencies for both import and export of agricultural produce, says Mr. Reddy.The low prices has also meant that the farmers are being left to their own devices as they can no longer afford to purchase inputs required to raise farm output. Tomato seeds cost Rs. 1 lakh per kilo. Farmers who cannot afford these are using old seeds for growing their crops. This is further lowering the yield. While the farm inputs have kept pace with inflation rising steadily, the price that the farmers are getting has not. This is leading to farm distress, reducing farmers to subsistence level, says Narasimha Reddy Donthi, an agriculture policy expert."

Most of the villages in these mandals are rainfed and farmers are forced to depend on irrigation water sources.The State government sanctioned NTR Jalasiri Phase II programme in the financial year 2016-17 for small and marginal farmers where additional groundwater recharge is available. The programme essentially focusses on utilisation of available groundwater resources and to promote conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater duly adhering to the norms mentioned under the A.P. Water, Land and Trees Act-2002.Mallisala village of Jaggampeta mandal is rainfed and in upland areas and dependent on the irrigation water tanks with meagre irrigation water sources. Only sago, mango and cashew is grown by farmers in this region. All the wage seekers in the village are developing the natural resources, hereby increasing their standard of living with the wages earned through NREGS.Success storiesTirri Ramu, a 60-year-old farmer in Mallisala, with a land holding of three acres, mostly depends on seasonal rain, and grows mango and cashew. He dug a borewell and connected a solar pump to it at a cost of Rs. 25,000 against the original price of Rs. 4.5 lakh. He has grown about 250 mango plants, cashew and tomato as intercrop for the past two years. His income incresaed from Rs. 30, 000 to Rs. 80, 000 per annum.Farmers of Korukonda are another example of the success of NTR Jalasiri programme where the yield from paddy has almost doubled.Surampudi Narasimha Murthy, a poor farmer having three acres of land, was getting only 10 to 15 bags per acre as the area is rainfed and also upland area. Project Director of District Water Management Authority (DWMA) G. Rajakumari said that when Mr. Murthy approached them, the authority offered solar-based borewell for Rs. 25,000 by giving a subsidy of Rs. 4.25 lakh.Field staff of DWMA and local NREGS installed borewell and solar panels in Mr. Murthys paddy field last year. This year, the yield has almost doubled to 30 bags. Last year, I got only 15 bags in my field and because of solar pumpset this year, I got 30 bags of paddy with which I am so happy, Mr. Murthy added."

Spandana is in charge of social media outreach for the Congress.The BJP wasn't happy with her comment, assuming she was referring to a hallucinogenic plant.""Most people of the country and our party members won't even know what you are referring to (including PM himself) but your Leader will connect with it instantly. While you have insulted people of India with your atrocious comment, your leader will be proud of you!!"", said BJP leader GVL Narasimha Rao.The BJP's Amit Malviya , its IT maven, also tweeted about Spandana's comment. He wondered whether Congress president Rahul Gandhi would suspend her like he did senior leader Mani Shankar Aiyar. The Congress suspended Aiyar from the party for using the word ""neech"" in a comment aimed at PM Modi during the Gujarat Assembly polls.Malviya, though, didn't 'tag' Spandana on Twitter, and the latter wondered if it was because those who follow him on the microblogging site would see her videos about PM Modi.""You didn't want to tag me cos you didn't want people to watch the Modi video pinned on my timeline?"" she said.Spandana also wondered - a mite disingenuously - what all the fuss was about, saying ""POT"" merely meant ""Potato, Onion, Tomato"".""Come on! Be a sport- And hey, POT = Potato ?? Onion Tomato ?? what were you thinking? ??,"" she tweeted.The BJP was not mollified. Its IT wing head Malviya said more than 3,500 farmers have committed suicide in Karnataka, the highest for any state in India, but ""speaking for them is being on 'POT'... Congress keeps it classy, again"".PM Modi used the word acronym ""TOP"" when talking about the Union Budget 2018's 'Operation Green'.""Farmers producing fruits and vegetables are our 'TOP' priority. 'TOP' means 'Tomato, Onion and Potato'. We have launched 'Operation Green' in interest of these farmers. 'Operation Green' would be beneficial for farmers just like the Amul model was successful in dairy,"" the PM said yesterday.(With inputs from PTI)"

The Gujarat government also sought information about the government of Indias recent budget announcement to provide an MSP of 1.5 times input cost, to include such a scheme in the state budget as well. After the partys near rout in rural areas in the 2017 assembly elections, the party has become sensitive to farmers issues. The Rupani government is planning a series of actions to address agrarian problems.A senior government officer privy to the development said, The state government has decided to adopt a new scheme for farmers to provide a reasonable MSP, as has been implemented in Madhya Pradesh and Telangana. The Madhya Pradesh government has a Bhavantar scheme for farmers, under which farmers get the difference between the market price and MSP directly in their account and they can sell directly at market price. So the government does not need to buy and store it as do today, in the case of groundnut. A lot of government resources will be saved on hiring godowns and using the produce later.The government is also considering a new scheme like in Telangana, where the government provides part of the input cost to farmers before sowing. The third option is a hybrid of the Madhya Pradesh and Telangana models, to suit Gujarats needs. The government is waiting for a response from GOI. In case of a delay from GOI, the state government has decided to opt for both the models. We have also contacted Niti Aayog, which is working on a new country-wide formula for MSP, the source added."

When politicians trade barbs and innuendo on social networking sites, it translates to business as usual. The key is to inform voters, not rabble-rouse or flood them with babble. Politicians not only need to broadcast their views, but also listen to their voters. And that should be done intelligently.BENGALURU: The Congress on Monday distanced itself from its social media head Divya Spandanas controversial tweet that made a derogatory and personal attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi , soon after she came under flak.Divya alias Ramya, former Mandya MP, had on Sunday taken a dig at Modi, wondering if he was on pot (cannabis), a putdown which invited sharp criticism. The actor-turned-politicians swipe came following Modis comment at a rally here, during which he said farmers were his top priority and described TOP as tomato, onion and potato. Is this what happens when youre on POT? she tweeted.Reacting to the pot jibe, chief minister Siddaramaiah said he is not aware of the tweet, but character assassination of any individual was not right.I have countered Modis allegations point-by-point against our government, but refrained from making any personal attack. He may be our political rival, but I will not speak disrespectfully of the PM personally. We are in a federal structure. We have accepted the Constitution. We have to run the government in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. We cant go against it. We are not the BJP to go against the Constitution, he said.Hitting out at Ramya, BJPs IT cell head Amit Malviya tweeted: In Karnataka, more than 3,500 farmers have committed suicide under @ siddaramaiahs watch, highest for any state in India but speaking for them is being on POT...Congress keeps it classy, again...And in another tweet: Will Rahul Gandhi maintain silence on Divya Spandanas comment while he sacked Mani Shankar Aiyar just because his jibe came close to Gujarat election and Karnataka is still some months away? Or sacrificing his close aide, responsible for his rise as a leader, takes some courage?To this Ramya replied: Single Meaning plz ! Share it with those who have understood. If TOP means Tomato Onion Pakoda sorry Potato for @narendramodi, POT can also mean Potato Onion & Tomato for @divyaspandana Think Good!!!"
