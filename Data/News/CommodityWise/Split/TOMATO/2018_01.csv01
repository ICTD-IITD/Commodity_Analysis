The PM on Sunday said in an address in the state that farmers are his ""TOP"" priority, and explained that by ""TOP"", he meant ""tomato, onion and potato"".Ergo, the Karnataka Congress today tweeted asking him questions on unemployment, using similar acronyms and giving new expansions to existing ones.""Mr. Modi, isn't your TOP priority to create Jobs? But your government is NDA - Not Doing Anything!"", tweeted the Congress party's Karnataka unit.NDA is, of course, a reference to the government at the Centre. It actually stands for 'National Democratic Alliance' and is a coalition of parties headed by the BJP About Modi's ""TOP"" comment, the Karnataka Congress got into a smidgen of trouble yesterday and on Sunday.What happened was that the Congress social media head and Karnataka unit member Divya Spandana asked referring to Modi's comment, ""Is this what happens when you're on POT?""The BJP wasn't happy with her comment, assuming she was referring to a hallucinogenic plant.""Most people of the country and our party members won't even know what you are referring to (including PM himself) but your Leader will connect with it instantly. While you have insulted people of India with your atrocious comment, your leader will be proud of you!!"", said BJP leader GVL Narasimha Rao.The BJP's Amit Malviya, its IT maven, also tweeted about Spandana's comment. He wondered whether Congress president Rahul Gandhi would suspend her like he did senior leader Mani Shankar Aiyar. The Congress suspended Aiyar from the party for using the word ""neech"" in a comment aimed at PM Modi during the Gujarat Assembly polls.Spandana then wondered - a mite disingenuously - what all the fuss was about, saying ""POT"" merely meant ""Potato, Onion, Tomato"".""Come on! Be a sport- And hey, POT = Potato ?? Onion Tomato ?? what were you thinking? ??,"" she tweeted.The BJP was not mollified. Its IT wing head Malviya said more than 3,500 farmers have committed suicide in Karnataka, the highest for any state in India, but ""speaking for them is being on 'POT'... Congress keeps it classy, again""."

This Valentines Day , we share the tales of togetherness from six such couples for whom neither the colour of their passports nor the flavour of their cuisine mattered as much as that overpowering, magical emotion called love.Over the years, many a foreign tourist has visited Vijay Kumars tattoo studio at Fort Kochi. But when Natalia from Russia walked in, on a lovely January evening last year, it was a never-before moment. She took away Vijay Kumar's heart and their love blossomed into marriage in November, last year!He describes that first meeting: Natalia visited my studio out of curiosity, not to get a tattoo done. But when we met, something magical happened. Her simplicity and soft-spoken nature struck me.For Natalia, who was working as a manager of a company in Russia, it was her first trip to India. I remember the day I met my husband, vividly. I was at the hotel near his studio for dinner. Seeing the sign board of the studio, I went in, and there he was, she says. The gentle, open minded and kind-hearted Vijay Kumar won her heart in no time. He also has a subtle sense of humour, which I liked very much, she fondly recalls.Natalia returned to Russia by January end, but the duo kept in touch. We used to call and text every day, during breaks and after her office time. I realised how she was perfect for me. I am a simple Fort Kochi man, not someone who leads an adipoli life full of alcohol and cigarettes. Natalia shares my views and understands me. When she said she was ready to marry me and settle down here, I knew it was truly special, Vijay Kumar says.Natalia came back again in July. In September, they registered their marriage and had the wedding ceremony in November. She makes great dosa, idly, tomato rice and other Indian dishes, he compliments Natalia. She adds, Its his mother who taught me to cook them. But I am yet to learn complicated dishes. A vegetarian, she names chilly gobi, chilly paneer and dal as her favourite foods.Does she miss Russia? Well, when I do, I can probably ask my husband to take me to Munnar, Natalia says. I am in touch with my family through internet and have asked them to make their next trip to Kerala. Once we save some money, Vijay and I would make our first trip to Russia together.Music composer Rahul Raj says it was love at first sight when he met Miriam Merkle from Germany for the first time. She had flown down to Kerala to study at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeethams Amritapuri campus in Kollam. It was her great love for Indian culture that made her take up this course. Rahul was a routine visitor at Amritapuri campus as part of his music assignments and he had seen her there once.She was my Orkut friend at that time and I was surprised when she sent a message  Rahul Chettaa, I have heard your compositions and they are very nice, says Rahul. Thus we became friends and fell in love later. We got married in May 2008, after five months of knowing each other. My mother was a little worried that I was marrying a western girl; she was doubtful if my non-Indian wife would be able to adopt our culture and systems. But they are now more like mother and daughter and Miriam is very fluent in Malayalam. She was very keen to understand our rituals including pujas that we perform at our houses. She is a homemaker but for me, she is a wonder woman who takes care of everything at home including my mothers health. Our daughter Akshainie Leiyas name is a blend of German and Indian cultures. For us, Valentines Day is another ordinary day. We love enjoying the ordinary days and celebrate our ordinary life which is the happiest thing for Miriam and me.Irina Antonova, 30, first connected with Paul Skaria on a social media platform in November 2010. They chatted generally on travelling, personal development and Russian history in which Paul took a lot of interest. They later lost touch and did not speak for years but the connection was reignited after Irina posted a photo from London in November 2013. Paul was working in that city then and they spent several days together and developed a strong bonding.In 2015, Paul invited her to his home in India where he introduced her to his parents and proposed to her. In July 2015, they registered their marriage in Kochi.Says Irina: I remember that day vividly because it was an unforgettable experience not only because I was the bride but also because I was getting married in another country. It was in a beautiful church not far from our home. Some traditions and customs were new but there were no major differences because we both belong to the Orthodox church. I was dressed in a white wedding gown which I brought from Moscow while Paul wore a black suit. Later, I changed to a sari and I felt like an oriental princess.The couple are now settled in Kochi. She adds: We communicate in English, so there is no language barrier between us. Of course, there are some differences but it is natural. Ive learned to respect other peoples views and opinions more and to understand the values of another culture, to think in new ways and to take new decisions. Ive started to understand myself and others better. Along with exploring a new culture I understood my own culture deeper.She remembers that on their first Valentines Day after marriage, Paul gifted her some awesome jewellery and she gave him a palette with their photos. But we have 365 days in a year when everyone gets a chance to say I love you to their beloved and family members.""Avithal Elias Lautman describes her love story as a very nerdy one. She jokes that all her life, she prayed for a chance to study in IIT but God laughed and sent her to an IIT outside India. So, it was when both she and Ronen Shmuel Lautman were students of the Israel Institute of Technology that they met at a Diwali party organised by Avithal, a jew from Kochi. He loved my channa masala and we kept bumping into each other since then. He even came for my thesis defence. He was always too shy to ask me out, even though it was obvious he liked me, she says.Before one New Year's Eve, Avithal mustered the courage to ask him out, encouraged by her best friend Sara. Luckily, he didn't have any plans. We went out for our first date on New Years Eve, and we talked the whole night. It was very romantic. I couldnt wait to see him again. We made plans to have dinner the next night, and the rest is history. They got married on October 5, 2015, and are settled in Haifa, Israel.She continues: We embraced each others cultural differences, including food and family traditions. It was easy for us as we wanted more or less the same things from life and shared ideas about money, food, lifestyle and religion. Our parents were more excited and welcoming than we thought. His family never ever made me feel uncomfortable because of who I was. And my mom was always understanding with Ronens PDA. Also we never made fun of each others culture, but we did fight over the space agencies. Also he started eating with hands and learning Malayalam. I have already taught him to say, ente bharya sundariya. And he taught me how to eat with chopsticks. We love each more because of the cultural differences.She adds: On Valentines Day, we usually avoid restaurants as it can get crowded. We do make special food that day. It is usually only the two of us and that might include walks on beaches and a really good dinner.We do tell every now and then how we appreciate each other for being there always and we do not wait for a special day to say I love you.They met first in Dhaka where Ganga Nimmy Jose Cheripuram was associated with a bank and looking for a renewable energy project for rural India through micro finance and Johannes Fischbeck was a manager in a German firm that provided energy solutions to the developing world.My first impression of Joe was not so romantic as he was very reserved. If somebody would have told me then that he would be the man I was going to marry, I would have ran away at that moment itself, says Ganga. He, however, was impressed with her socialising.The long car rides in the next three weeks changed the equations drastically. We talked about our personal lives and realised that though representing vastly different cultures, we had a lot of common views. Still, it was the shock of my life, when he, after a week, confessed me that he liked me. I turned him down but one more week later, I found myself liking him too.Soon it was time to part ways. Joe went to Tanzania for another project while Ganga returned to Kerala. Mails and skype followed, not all of it official.Three months later, they decided to get married. For Joe, it was a bit strange to marry a girl whom he knew for such a short period but getting married was the only way to be together. Luckily, it was not so difficult to convince my family, says Ganga.Six months after their first meeting, Joe came down to Kochi with his parents and best friend. The Germans were astonished to see the 500-strong crowd while the Indians thought it to be a modest wedding. Joe still complains about the 300 photographs for which he was forced to smile.Ganga joined him in Berlin and found that language was a major barrier. There were other barriers too. We are so different. Introvert to extrovert, writer to talker, reader to cook, musician to gardener, cycling to watching movies...We never share any hobbies. But then, we really compliment each other. We do all our holidays to household works together.Daughter Emma was born in India and they stayed on in Kochi. So Joe started working as a renewable energy consultant in Kochi and I started a small business that deals with landscaping and terrariums. We enjoyed every moment of our six years in Kochi with lots of fun and fellowship.She adds: When it is time for Emma to start schooling, we came back to Germany and settled here now. In Joe's words, I am living physically here and mentally in Kerala. I continue my business in Kochi and am very well updated on all happenings in Kerala."
5b16731b9855b76a5f1a5ebf,Bumper tomato crop leaves farmers in red,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bumper-tomato-crop-leaves-farmers-in-red/articleshow/62942078.cms,2018-02-16,"BHOPAL: A bumper tomato crop in Madhya Pradesh and ban on its export to Pakistan have sent prices plummeting in the state, putting farmers on the edge of a fresh crisis.The government, which is already scrambling to tackle the massive crop damage from unseasonal hailstorms, now faces a challenge that is not covered by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhans recent assurances to farmers.With tomato selling for a mere Rs 2-3/kg at many places, many farmers are forced to let their crop rot in the fields since the price doesnt even cover the cost of plucking and transportation. The administration, however, feels its not at crisis level because tomato is a multipleharvest crop.Mahendra Singh, the biggest tomato farmer in Kolaras of Shivpuri  one of the three districts that produce the crop  said: A crate carrying about 25-30kg of tomato is being sold for Rs 60 to Rs 75. This is too little. The cost of growing the crop is about Rs 3.5/kg per hectare of land, which is why farmers in Shivpuri, where the best quality tomatoes are produced, are incurring huge losses. Kolaras has assembly bypoll on February 24.Earlier,10,000-oddcrates of tomato used to be sent to Pakistan, said Singh. But the export has been stopped. Now we are sending only to Nepal, and that too only about 5% of what used to be sold in the past. The surplus tomato is now being sold at a throw away prices, he added.Another big tomato grower, B P Dhakad of Ratlam, told TOI, At the moment, tomato is being sold in Pakistan at Rs 100-150 because the Centre has stopped export. The shelf life of our tomato is 3 to 4 days and in this period the yield can be sent to Pakistan only, a country with huge consumption of the vegetable.There are reports from Khargone and Badwani of farmers destroying their yield in the farms itself. Things may worsen in other parts of the state, said Shivpuris Mahendra Singh Horticulture director Satyanand doesnt agree. Tomato is a multipleplucking crop and farmers sometime sell their yield at Rs 40 a kg. Had they been incurring losses, they would have stopped cultivating tomato, he said.About governments plan to establish food processing units to utilise the yield, he said, We are still hopeful. But it is a risky business. Investors are scared that farmers may shift to other crops. Food processing plants are yield specific. A plant installed for tomato cannot process any other vegetable."
5b167c229855b72ada08764c,Cabbage price plunges to Rs 8/kg,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/cabbage-price-plunges-to-rs-8/kg/articleshow/63061453.cms,2018-02-25,"Trichy: At just Rs 8 a kg, the price of cabbage has taken a steep fall in Trichy over the last few days. Last month, the price of the vegetable was around Rs 30  35 per kg. Traders at the Gandhi market in the city stated that the fall in price was mainly owing to the increase in supply and lower demand.At a time when selling one bundle of cabbage itself is a big task and we are provided with two or three more bundles, it is only obvious that we have to decrease the price to sell them off, said R Loganathan , who works at a vegetable shop at Gandhi Market.Cabbages mostly come from Bengaluru and the supply has increased significantly over the last few weeks, he added. We dont sell the unsold cabbages the next day, so it is absolutely crucial that we reduce the price so that we dont incur losses, he added.Other reasons for the fall in prices of vegetables are the cultivation trends of farmers and increase in number of markets in the city, claim a few traders.M Thangamani, manager at V S Karuppaiah vegetable shop at Gandhi market, said that many farmers cultivate a particular crop which would be highly priced at that point of time. Take tomato for example, if the price of the vegetable is high, every farmer starts to cultivate it, which eventually results in bigger supply and lower price, he said.Several traders had also predicted that the price of cabbage would increase again in a couple of weeks. It is not the case only with cabbage  any vegetable which is sold at a steep price would have a drastic fall in the following month. Its a cycle, Loganathan said, adding, For instance, coriander, which was sold for only Rs 5-6 per kg last month, is now being sold at Rs 15-16 a kg."

When the price dropped to Rs. 3 a kilogram for tomato, farmers had left the crop unplucked. Some of them dumped heaps of ripe tomatoes by the road when they failed to get a price that would at least cover the labour cost.Kerala is the main market for the crop produced in the border villages. In the main vegetable market at Udumalpet in Tamil Nadu, farmers had to sell a 14-kg box of tomatoes for Rs. 20. The cost of plucking 14 kg alone is estimated at Rs. 10. Hence they find plucking the crop pointless.Rs. 20 in IdukkiThe same crop is charged Rs. 10 to 15 at the market at Marayur, in Idukki district, nearly 40 km from Udumalpet. In other areas of Idukki, the price is Rs. 20 or above.Market sources said tomato prices nosedived following a bumper production on the border villages, facilitated by the use of high quality seeds and a favourable climate there. They cultivated varieties such as 5005, US1, and US3. The demand for tomatoes in Kerala has not dwindled, but it is not high enough to absorb this added production. Last year, the price was almost 30% higher at the time of harvest.Boxes of tomatoes are left unsold at the Udumalpet market, which, along with Ottanchatram and Pollachi, is the main vegetable market near the border in Tamil Nadu. At Uralpatti, Edayamuthur, and Kannamanaickanur, tonnes of ripe tomatoes were found unplucked on the farms. The crop is mostly cultivated at Gudimangalam, Pethappampatti, Pollavadi, and Kurichikottai villages of Tirupur and Kumaralingam and Palani valleys of Tamil Nadu from October to January. In 45 days, it will yield fruit. In the cool-season vegetable producing villages of Kanthallur and Vattavada in Kerala, tomato is not cultivated now. It was cultivated earlier, but with poor availability of water and change in climatic conditions, farmers slowly shifted to other vegetables, said a farmer at Kanthallur."

Narayan, former Economic Adviser to the Prime Minister, said.Rice and wheat are standard items and the government has been procuring them over a long period of time. But the case of potato and tomato is different with so many variants. To standardise and give the correct price would be difficult, he pointed out.Mr. Narayan was speaking at a seminar titled Demystifying the Union Budget 2018, organised by The Womens Christian College in association with Finmark Trainers.Regular increaseHe pointed out that in the UPA regime between 2004 and 2014, there was regular increase in the minimum support price and farmers were better off.After 2014, the minimum support price was not increased. But, the cost has gone up and there are several instances of farmers distress. One shot increase in the minimum support price is a good sign, though it might be inflationary for the common man, Mr. Narayan said.The budget proposal to provide technology for horticulture was a great idea, but the government needed to spell out its plan clearly, he added."

Maybe this is because there are quite a few things that Ive refused to put in my mouth. Over the years its become a perverse fascination of mine to see what other people hate to eat. Perhaps this started when, as a kid, I developed a deep disgust for ghee  not a good aberration in a child with a Gujarati Vaishnav background. Well into adulthood I would recoil at any sight of ghee, whether it was being put in diyas for puja, spread on thin Gujju rotis or some mother/aunt-type culinary sergeant was attempting to sully my precious aamras with a drizzle of this melted hell-produce. My mom was unmoved and caustically pointed out the sheer idiocy of my attempting a ghee-mukt diet: You lovemagas(a typical Gujarati sweet) and it is full of ghee! Or: You love your Punjabi food and a lot of it is made with ghee! (A really sore point for her was not that I liked Punjabi vegetarian grub but that I ranked it on par with Gujju food.) My point was, as long as I couldnt see it, it was fine, but the visuals were intolerable, setting off a chain of retching in my throat.Food phobiasI was a weird kid. I hated ghee, rice andbaingan, but I lovedkarelaand the umami of vaal ni daal . Of my two sons, the older one decided at the advanced age of three to keep his fathers perversity but not for the same food. For the longest time I couldnt put any tomato-based product in front of him, namely, anything in which you could discern the offending red fruit. Would he eat pizza? Ye-es. Not as enthusiastically as other kids but he would eat it. Pasta sauce with tomato elements? Yes, as long as it was paste. Tomato salad? No way. Ketchup? No, wed have violence if there was any on the table.Then there is a friend of mine, S, a Gujju and a food lover from the same background as mine, for whom the kryptonite effect comes from just seeing coriander. Again, this is extreme cultural treason from a Gujju, but there it is. Forget about actual cilantro, we friends can torture him simply by posting photos of the green stuff on his Facebook page. How can a Gujju not love kothmir ? people ask him. S just smiles and says: But I love fish like a Bengali! At one point, S explained to me with the aid of a scientific website how the leaf actually sets off a semi-allergic reaction in him. Again, if he cant see it or smell it, hes fine. So no chopped coriander on his dhoklas, but if I use it as part of a paste in a daal hell eat it happily.Speaking of cultural traitors, people who know Im into food often ask me about the fact that I wont eat anything that has had any activity in water. People who dont know me well often ask: What kind of a Bengali doesnt love fish? My answer is simple: Im not a Bengali. I may have sloughed off my strict vegetarian upbringing, I may revel in eating all sorts of meat (yes, that kind and also that other kind), but this Pesciphobia is perhaps a remaining trace of my core childhood. Next question: How can you be a foodie and not explore seafood? A shifty Lefty once said: Im not a Marxist but Im a student of Marx. My reply goes: Im not a foodie but a spectator of foodie-ism. Which, of course, brings me to my Bong foodie friend who also doesnt much like fish. This friend, N, has even made a long documentary about Bengalis and fish, and he will lecture you knowledgeably about all the thousand varieties of fish available in the delta and how Bengalis of different persuasion (Ghoti or Bangal) like to cook them, but he will rarely touch the slippery suspects himself.Phobias shiftThe thing Ive noticed about these phobias is that they shift. Today, Son No. 1 is a reasonably good cook and he even uses tomatoes sometimes, though you can still get him to comply to demands by waving a bottle of ketchup. N is gradually beginning to include fish in his cooking repertoire, even though he himself barely eats it. Another friend, who used to find European cheese difficult to comprehend, is now, under direct pressure from a romantic and emotional direction, starting to discuss the joys of chvre, brie, pecorino and manchego. The other day, I found myself at a new restaurant trying and really liking some beautifully cooked crustaceans, lobsterish white pulp, glittering black eggs and all. Well before that, I discovered the joys of proper, naked ghee, the nice one my local milk-wala makes, the beautifully fragrant variety you get from Mysore, and even the superb organic one produced at a farm in Suffolk that costs 10 for a small jar. As N has demonstrated to me, decent ghee is central to a first course in Bong food, mixed with plain, hot rice plus some crisp, bitter element such as karela , thus creating a dtente between what Ive always loved and till recently hated. Does this mean I foresee S soon relishing a crown of coriander on a ceviche? No, that may take some time, but S has promised that the day a certain other pair of Gujaratis are forced to loosen their grip on power, he will eat something with a garnish of kothmir."

The price of vegetables in wholesale markets, and uzhavar santhai are fixed based on the arrival of stock and the prevailing demand.The price of vegetables has been coming down in the last few weeks.Normally, the prices go up during marriage season, and other festival days.The price of small onion has fallen from Rs. 180 a kg in December last to about Rs. 24 in uzhavar santhai on Monday.The price of tomato stood at Rs. 7 a kg; brinjal about Rs. 14; ladys finger Rs. 24; potato Rs. 20; snake gourd Rs. 10; broad beans Rs. 14; cluster beans Rs. 20; bitter gourd Rs. 16; green chilli Rs. 16; Bellary onion Rs. 27; cabbage Rs. 12; carrot Rs. 30; and radish Rs. 6.The price of coconuts, however, has gone up.Many consumers said that low price of vegetables will help those belonging to the weaker sections of society while conducting marriages.The farmers at Suramangalam uzhavar santhai said that the district experienced widespread rainfall by the end of last year, following which farmers had raised vegetables in a larger area. There was a spurt in vegetable production in the villages due to the availability of adequate water. The bulk arrival of all sorts of vegetables in the markets has brought down their price.The bulk arrival is expected to continue for a few more weeks, they said."

With the commencement of the harvest period, the markets and godowns at Thammampatti have been receiving bulk stock of tomatoes daily.Due to the abundant availability of tomatoes, the price has nosedived for the past few weeks. The price has also gone down due to competition between people running the godowns.The price of tomatoes remained at Rs. 130 per bag containing 28 kg at Thammampatti. The price is Rs. 200 in Thalaivasal and Rs. 160 in the neighbouring Tiruchi district. As the farmers will be incurring additional expenses for transporting the harvested tomatoes to the markets and godowns, they have decided to convert the tomatoes into seeds for the next season.S. Mani, a farmer of Thammampatti, said that he spent Rs. 1,800 for the nursery for half acre land, after incurring heavy expenditure for ploughing the land, administering manure and removing the weeds.They have to pay Rs. 100 as wages for each worker for plucking 100 kg of tomatoes. They are not getting even the wages they pay to the workers from marketing the crop at present. As we will be incurring only additional expenditure by transporting the crop to the markets, we have decided to store them as seeds for next season.People involved in marketing tomato seedlings collect them in bulk from the farmers and market them to the needy farmers of other parts of the district. We are getting a little more revenue by marketing the seedlings then by selling the tomatoes, Mani says.The price of tomatoes has also fallen in the other production centres such as Mecheri and Muthunaikenpatti in the district.The price has been constantly remaining between Rs. 6 and Rs. 8 in the uzhavar santhais and other markets in the district."

MEP is the minimum price below which exporters cant export onions.The step would help in arresting crash in wholesale onion prices, which has a detrimental effect on the prices that farmers get from selling their product. The notification issued by the director general of foreign trade of Union ministry of commerce, Alok Vardhan Chaturvedi , said that MEP on all varieties of onions stands removed and can be exported without MEP.A copy of the notification is in possession of TOI. Experts said that removal of MEP is the first step towards tackling the volatility in onion prices.The Union government in its budget presented on Thursday had announced launching of Operation Greens scheme to address price fluctuations in onions, potato and tomato for benefit of farmers and consumers with budgetary allocation of Rs 500 crore for the scheme for the fiscal 2018-19.For two years since December 24, 2015 there was no MEP of on onions.However Centre re-imposed MEP on onions on November 23 last year at USD 850 per tonne. Thereafter on January 19, Centre had also reduced the MEP on onions to USD 700 per tonne.The sources from the ministry of agriculture said, During the recent meeting with the officials from the ministry of commerce, it had already been decided to remove the MEP on onions if the average wholesale onion prices dropped below Rs 2,000 per quintal. Now, the average wholesale onion prices have already dropped to Rs 1,500 per quintal. Hence, it had been immediately decided to remove the MEP of onions."

There may be exceptions but it holds true for Perumal Murugan, the Tamil writer, several of whose books have been translated into English. The latest being Poonachi or The story of a black goat (Context).We meet at The Parks Mist restaurant for lunch. Asking the staff to suggest South Indian cuisine, Murugan quickly settles for onion uttapam. I can never say no to onion uttapam; its my favourite, he says with a genial smile. Meanwhile, fresh watermelon juice is served providing a perfect start to our chat.With a collection of poems and short stories and now Poonachi , Murugan seems to have gotten over the controversy created over his book Madhorubhagan or One Part Woman . Referring to it, he observes, I do not hold any grudge or hard feelings. What I am very sorrowful about is that peoplewho did not read my book protested against it. That is what dismayed me. It must have been hard giving up writing? No, on the contrary, I got enough time to spend with my family, grow potted plants and devote time to academics, says Murugan with the help of an interpretor.For Murugan, writing has been a second nature since he was eight. There was a childrens programme on Trichy radio station in which poems written by kids were read out. I used to regularly contribute for that. I wrote everyday because I am introvert, retiring and shy by nature. I did not talk a lot, and always avoided crowds. So, writing poems and stories substituted social interaction. Believe it or not, I managed to fill up 30 notebooks, he recalls.Writing short stories commenced from Class IX. I was inspired after reading graphic tales in magazines which I could not afford but my aunt used to buy. Gradually, my teachers came to know and encouraged me to participate in local school contests. Thus set in motion was Murugans life long passion for chiselling words.Pursuing Ph.D., Murugans first novel Eru Veyyil (The Rising Heat) was published in 1991 which he wrote during his summer vacations. I was 25 then and wrote it staying with my mother in a thatched hut with no electricity. My mother would be busy with the livestock while I lost sense of time adhering to my own clock. I used to only sleep, eat and write, never going out. This got her worried with many suggesting that I had lost my mind. So before returning to Chennai, she made me wear a holy thread blessed by a pujari around the waist. Every time I returned home I had to show it to her, he jests. As a child he loved sitting on a village boulder scribbling in his notebooks. My neighbours would tell me that one day I will get stuck to the boulder and would have to be surgically separated from it.Having lost his father early, Murugan was very close to his mother. I was called a mamas boy even after I got married. In a certain sense I narrate my mothers story through Poonachi. Like the goat, she too was the seventh child who lost her mother at birth; was a loner with her father being rarely at home. Their filial bond is so strong that even today Murugan has kept his mothers cell phone and SIM card as a memory.So is Murugan like his mother, a staunch believer of God? In my early years I was, visiting Kali and Murugan temples regularly. Later, studying Marxism and Periyars works, I started questioning, with the intensity of worship coming down. Those days, I argued with my mother on several occasions. Over the years reading more on these issues, I have come to the conclusion that whether God exists or not is not important but what is pertinent is whether He is necessary or not. For those He is, they must believe in Him without being criticised. Espousing live and let live, his belief sounds fair. Continuing, he adds, I do like to spend time at some of my favourite temples and tend to embrace the spiritual component of religion.The staff brings in sizzling onion uttapam with different chutneys, the coconut and its mint and tomato flavoured versions. Trying each of them, Murugan, gestures his appreciation. The uttapam is crisp and well made and the chutneys delicious. Not averse to trying local cuisine, the writer generally prefers South Indian dishes. I relish idlis, ragi dosa made with palm sugar, rice and paruppu kuzhambu; dishes made of country chicken but staying in Korea for a writers residency I had local preparation for a month without any fuss. Hailing from a rural region, Murugan has a weakness for vegetables. I love bitter gourd, suraikai (bottle gourd), lady finger, podalangai (snake gourd), brinjal and peerkangai (ridge gourd). The joke at home is whenever I am sent to buy vegetables these are bound to figure. Murugan does miss some preparations of his native place like kachayam, made of rice flour and jaggery and soiyang, a steamed pulse based dish kneaded with palm sugar. With passage of time, people have stopped making them.Calling himself a reasonable cook, Murugan reveals that like writing, he embraced cooking very early in life. With my parents leaving early to work on fields, my brother and I used to prepare and eat breakfast and walk five kilometres to school. We simply learnt by observing mother and helping her. He counts arisi paruppa, milagai (black pepper) and herbal rasams as his best preparation. The ridge gourd subzi I whip up, is relished by my wife so much that on returning home after holidays she always asks me to make it.Murugans felicity with cooking comes across in some of his works too. Yes, it does, but not deliberately, only on demand of the narrative. For example, in Arthanari and Aalavayan , sequels to the One Part Woman , I talk about how to grow and prepare a local variety of egg plant as mother used to. In Poonachi, I write about rice gruel and how to make dry salted meat pieces for future use. Likewise, in Seasons of the Palm there is description of ragi porridge.Drawing parallelsHaving learnt to wield the pen and cooking spud since childhood, Murugan says one can draw a lot of parallels between the two arts. For cooking and writing, passion, perseverance and persistence are must. Also to excel in their craft, the cook and writer must get out of their comfort zone and try something new. And eventually, both food and a work of literature must satisfy people.Reflecting on the making of a writer, Murugan states, The command over language and the content selection comes with experience. The foundation of good writing is the ability to get past ones own value system because that is what holds us from absorbing a lot of things. A good writer has to suspend his own value system and assimilate experiences. Did this come to him naturally? No, in many of my early works, for example, my short story collection, Thiruchengodu , I was heavily biased. Later I got over them and started writing on issues considered taboo by society. Examples of these are Pee Kadaigal (tales about shit) and Kethavarthe Pesarae (I speak bad words).Talking about keeping aside biases, Murugan is remarkable for etching characters which are neither black nor white. I avoid creating one dimensional characters. I believe all humans are a mix of both. In Poonachi, the old lady who is very caring to the goat becomes selfish when it comes to her survival. In her early years, her love is pure and selfless while later when she faces financial crunch, her kindness becomes conditional but that does not make her an villain. That is the way humans are, he remarks as we wind up our interaction.What I am very sorrowful about is that people who did not read my book protested against it. That is what dismayed me"

It is used to establish the diversity between populations, authenticate a species and in timber forensics.The process of DNA isolation involves treating the tissue sample from a species in chemical solutions called buffers, which is put in a column (a small container) and processing them in a centrifuge, which isolates the DNA. Earlier, this process was done manually, which would take almost a day. Later, there were several commercial kits which simplified the DNA isolation process.But these kits worked well only for commercial crops such as rice, tomato or cotton. When it came to tree tissue samples, most of these commercial kits usually dont yield results as trees have certain chemical compounds called secondary metabolites, which tamper with the reactions, said Modhumita Dasgupta, a scientist at the department of plant biotechnology in IFGTB, who was part of a group of scientists which devised the kit. Dasgupta said they have introduced an extra buffer solution in the kit which would remove secondary metabolites from tree tissues, thus giving pure DNA samples.She added that they first devised the protocol for their own laboratory use. They had patented it in 2009. Last year, the institute registered the trademark ArborEasy. The ready-to-use kit was launched on January 24.Dasgupta said those kits which yielded results for tree tissue samples were expensive. It cost around Rs200 to Rs300 for one reaction. But we have brought it down to Rs95 per reaction, Dasgupta said. Also the kit gives a high amount of DNA compared to other commercial kits, she said.In one reaction, our kit yields the amount of DNA other commercial kits yield in two, she said. In case of difficult tissues, our kits yield DNA, when others give none, she added.The kit isolates DNA from tissue samples in just around 90 minutes, said Dasgupta. She added that the DNA isolated using the kit has very high purity and a longer shelf-life, Dasgupta said. The DNA isolated using the kit can be used for experiments. We have used it for sequencing sandalwood genome, she added.The institute is also planning to commercialize the innovation, officials said. DNA isolation kits have a huge market today. Almost every college has students who do projects which involve DNA isolation at some level, Dasgupta said.For the first time, the institute has been planning to market the product in e-commerce portals, said S Murugesan, scientist and group coordinator for research, IFGTB. We also have asked for a seed funding to set up a unit in the institute to produce the kits commercially, he said."

And this has started affecting their price in the retail market.Usually, during February and March, the supply of vegetables is stable as the air can hold moisture for a long time and it is suitable to store them for one to two days. In April, the supply starts dropping and two months later the prices soar by around 25% to 30%.Currently, the supply of cauliflower has been reduced from 336 bags (50kg each) to 325 bags. Similarly, tomato supply has come down to 1,300 crates from 1,500 crates in 10 days. The marginal reduction in supply has led to increase in prices. The tomatoes that now cost Rs 20 per kg in the retail market costed Rs 14 per kg 10 days ago.Mohan Salpe , secretary of agriculture produce market committee, said, Only a required amount of vegetables is being harvested by farmers every day. The supply is already coming down, the effects of which will be visible in next one week. Vegetables, being a perishable produce, gets easily spoiled during high temperature. Also, adequate care needs to be taken while transporting vegetables during summer. At the same time, the supply of some vegetables such as spinach increases these days as farmers cannot keep such produce in the farm for more days unlike brinjal (eggplant) or tomatoes.The vegetable supply in retail markets comes from the nearby rural parts of the district. The sugarcane farmers tend to cultivate vegetables as inter-crop in their farms after sugarcane is cut and sent to the mills. Such vegetables are available in abundant during January and February.However, now the supply of vegetables grown as intercrop starts declining and the retail markets depend on vegetables supplied from the distant places that makes it costly owing to the transportation cost."

A year since its inception, H Kiruthikas eatery  which serves as many as 47 varieties of dosais  has become one of the most sought-after destinations for Trichiites. What is more, a customer can even get his or her own dosai recipe tried out here for a small fee.Asked to pick her favourite from the lot, Kiruthika says the special sweet dosai is of huge demand. Right from top police officers to restaurant owners, we have some loyal customers for this particular dish, she tells TOI. Available for Rs 30, the specialty dish is made of dosai laced with brown sugar, grated coconut and ghee.Other top-selling dosai varieties include all-in-one dosai, Mysuru masala dosai and onion rava dosai. All-in-one dosai, in which we add all masala ingredients, is now a close competition for special sweet dosai, says Kiruthika, a mother of two. Her husband, R Hari Suresh, who works at the registrar office in Bharathidasan University , is of immense support to her. My mother and my wifes family members also help her in running the eatery. Its our team work that has enabled us to be successful, says Hari. While most of the dosais are available for Rs 30, the costliest one happens to be all-in-one dosai, which is priced at Rs 60. Three types of chutneys -- coconut, tomato and mint -- are provided along with the dosais.Kiruthika says that celebrating the first anniversary of her eatery a couple of weeks ago was one of the proudest moments of her life. We distributed sweets to customers that day and they wished us whole-heartedly, she adds. Around 250 to 350 customers visit Kirthis Dosaa Point, which is open from 7 pm to 11.15 pm daily and Kiruthika insists on keeping the place family-friendly. Since a lot of people come with their children, we make sure the surroundings are totally clean. Also, we make it a point to serve only very healthy food, says she.Though the menu card has 47 varieties of dosais, based on customer suggestions customised dosais are also provided for an extra charge of Rs 5. People now are very creative and experimental when it comes to food. Customers, who come to our place, give their suggestions and we make dosas as per their wish. As a result, we now offer around 75 varieties, claims Kiruthika.Her family is now aggressively looking out for an ideal place near Chathiram bus stand to expand the business. It is one of our dreams.

Potato crop is also likely to remain down to stagnant this sowing season, horticulture departments senior official said.The official said, Heavy losses suffered by onion and tomato farmers in the past months has discouraged sowing.In June 2017, farmers staged protest in the entire state after onion prices slid to Rs 2 per kg. Tomato prices have also tumbled this season to Rs 5 per kg-Rs 8 per kg in the wholesale market on increased arrivals.Agriculture experts said, even the soil moisture remained less during the sowing period owing to less rains.Farmers shifted to chana as it gave better returns to farmers last season. Also chana requires less water making it the preferred choice of farmers when rains are not sufficient, said Kailash Agrawal , an agriculture expert.Chana and wheat are the leading winter sown crops of the region.Agriculture departments statistics stated that farmers have sown wheat on over 5.75 lakh hectare while chana was sown on 4.75 lakh hectare in Indore division.Horticulture department expects yield of potato to remain lower this season hitting output due to lower soil moisture.Mohan Pandey, a wholesaler of vegetables in Choithram market said, Prices of onions and tomatoes are unlikely to pick up from the current levels in near term as supplies from the old stocks and neighbouring states are sufficient to meet the demand."

Prices of onion, tomato and beans at the state-run stores differ from their retail counterparts by a few rupees. However, there is a significant gap between the prices of carrots, brinjals, etc (see infographic).Our intervention has helped the common man get fresh vegetables at subsidized rates. said horticulture chairman, Madhav Kerkar Meanwhile, vegetable vendor Hyder Ali said, There has been a good produce of vegetables in the neighboring states and a lot of vegetables have come into the market as a result; therefore the low rates. The rates will continue to be like this as of now. They may jump in April once summer starts full swing.Besides being cheap, consumers also seemed particularly happy about the freshness of the greens as well. Attributing the reason for the freshness to delivery timings, another vendor said, The vegetable trucks are coming into the market early every day. Therefore, the fresh supply.

Though the output has doubled in the last three months, the prices are yet to pick up. On Monday, the model price for the number one variety stood at Rs. 56 per 10 kg box, and the second at Rs. 30 per box.Though the stocks are reaching the Madanapalle market in several loads, the prices are not encouraging, say the farmers. From the last week of April, the produce showed signs of cracks due to intolerance to the abnormal heat. Mercury hardly crossed 35 degrees Celsius in the previous years in the area. For this reason, the first variety loads have dwindled, leaving the second variety to thrive, causing concern at trading.As the undamaged stocks are being sent to all over Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and other southern States, the domestic market has to depend on the loads with cracks and black spots.No cheer till JuneThe trade is unlikely to bring cheers to the farmers till May end or June first week, though it is projected that the stocks reaching the market would increase from the present 360 tonnes a day to more than 500 tonnes.Expecting profits, the farmers of Anantapur district, Chintamani, Rayalpadu and other border areas of Karnataka are also thronging the Madanapalle market. Despite the discouraging conditions, they have some consolation that the price is better than their domestic markets.Market Committee (Madanapalle) Chairman Ratakonda Gurappa Naidu said compared to the other markets in Rayalaseema or the southern States, the trade is not that disappointing. By the next two weeks, the heat might come down with seasonal showers or monsoons arrival. We are expecting bulk stocks from this month end. The situation is likely to improve soon, he said."
