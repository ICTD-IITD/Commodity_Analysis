He has made a budgetary allocation of Rs 500 crore for the scheme.'Operation Greens shall aim at promoting Farmer Producers Organizations (FPOs), agri-logistics, processing facilities and professional management.The announcement of this scheme comes at a time when onion farmers of Nashik, the largest onion growing district in the country, are at the receiving end as they are not getting the right prices for their produce in the market.The scheme, insisted experts and farmers, will go a long way in preventing financial losses to onion growers following crash in wholesale onion prices that they often have to cope up with.According National Horticulture Research & Development Foundation (NHRDF) sources, the average production cost for growing onions is around Rs 900 per quintal and farmers incur losses if they get the price below that.But there have been several occasions in the past when the wholesale onion prices had crashed increasing the woes of the onion farmers of the district. And they had restored to agitations by organising protests like road roko demanding redressal of their grievances.Some onion farmers still recalled the huge crash of onion about two years back forcing 1.94 lakh onion farmers of the district to sell around 28 lakh quintals of onions at Rs 300-400 per quintal in just two months in 2016. They incurred financial losses of Rs 150 cr during that time.A major onion grower of the district Nivrutti Nyaharkar said that for long the onion farmers of Nashik have been demanding a scheme like Operation Greens to tackle the problem of onion price volatility."
5b1860c29855b744d639b21e,Farmers are not getting a fair price,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-are-not-getting-a-fair-price/article24070354.ece,2018-06-03,"Why the drop in rates?Garlic has been the latest casualty of the price crash in the vegetable market after poor returns of tomato and potato crops forced many farmers to abandon their produce owing to a bumper output in recent days. The miseries of financially distressed farmers seem far from over even as they continue to demand waiver of farm loans and remunerative prices for their produce through several platforms across the country.The problem of plenty has hit the farmers badly. While garlic farmers in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, which produce 45% of the countrys garlic, recently fetched as low as Rs. 1 a kg in wholesale prices, the instances of tomato farmers dumping their harvest on the fields earlier this month  be it in Haryana, Tamil Nadu or Uttar Pradesh after prices nosedived  have only highlighted their woes. Tomato production during 2017-18, according to the first advance estimate, is likely to be 7.8% higher than that of the previous year. However, it is 20% higher than the average production of the past five years. Similarly, potato production is estimated to be 1.5% higher than that of the previous year. However, compared with the average production of the past five years, it is 8.7% higher. These figures indicate that farmers are producing more without good returns. Why are vegetable farmers not getting a fair price? Season after season, farmers face price uncertainties mainly owing to fluctuations in demand and supply caused by bumper or poor production, speculation and hoarding by traders.Are traders manipulating prices?In Madhya Pradesh, after garlic prices dropped sharply, the government decided to include it in the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (Price Deficit Payment Scheme) that was introduced in the Kharif 2017 season. Farmers, however, rue that with the conditions associated with the scheme, most of them are unable to gain any benefit. The scheme is aimed at providing price deficit payments to farmers if the market prices are below the minimum support price. Farmer leaders believe the implementation of this scheme in the first season has resulted in little benefit to farmers, with very little to prevent manipulation of prices by traders. The government claims to have disbursed Rs. 1,900 crore in compensation, but a large section of farmers has been excluded from the scheme, says Jai Kisan Andolan national convener Avik Saha. Those left out bore the brunt of a larger price crash because of market manipulation.What is the way forward?The fluctuation in vegetable prices has become a perennial problem and is usually associated with the economics of demand and supply. Farmers, mainly marginal and small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. Being perishable, vegetables are more prone to price fluctuation, hence they require better infrastructure for storage and marketing. Contract farming is an alternative for farmers to reduce financial risks by providing an assured market for their produce at a pre-agreed price. The Centre last week approved the State/UT Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2018. The Act lays stress on protecting the interests of farmers, considering them as weaker of the two parties entering into a contract. The Act is aimed at ensuring the purchase of the entire pre-agreed quantity of one or more of produce, livestock or its product. Although varied forms of contract farming exist in some pockets, a formal system is not widespread. By and large, cultivation of commercial crops such as cotton, sugarcane, tobacco, tea, coffee, rubber and dairy has had some elements of informal contract farming.Experts believe that integration of vegetable and fruit growers with agro-processing units through contract farming could prove beneficial to producers as it takes care of price fluctuations and helps to mitigate production risk. Pratap Singh Birthal, professor at the National Institute of Agricultural Economics and Policy Research, says: Under the contract farming law, the agreements would help farmers get an assured price for the produce, which will act as a buffer against price volatility and market fluctuations...Vikas Vasudeva"

While more than 100 farmers outfits participated in the strike, major organisations in the State like the Raju Shetti-led Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana refrained from actively participating in the protest.In Khed Shivapur, farmers condemned the apathy of the Devendra Fadnavis-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government by spilling thousands of litres of milk along Pune-Bengaluru highway.Similar scenes were witnessed near Sinnar-Shirdi highway in Nashik. Farmers demonstrated by spilling milk and demanding a complete loan waiver and immediate implementation of the recommendations put forward by the M.S. Swaminathan Committee on agrarian reform. According to reports, the police detained three protesters in Saikheda in Nashik.At Khamkheda village in the districts Deola tehsil, tomato farmers protested by throwing their produce on the roads.

Many are also selling them within the villages, said Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU). Today is only the first day, so urban markets are still able to sell what was supplied earlier. Wait and see; by day after tomorrow, prices will shoot up in cities.Ramandeep Sangh Mann, a farmer leader associated with the KEM  an umbrella body of 62 farmer groups  said, According to local reports, 40% of milk supply in Punjab is affected.Extending support to the farmers campaign, Punjab Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu visited Patto village in Fatehgarh Sahib and purchased milk and vegetables directly from a farmer.In Haryana, arrival of farm produce at urban centres was down by 70 to 80%, BKU leader Rakesh Bains told The Hindu .Mr. Bains said implementing the Swaminathan Commissions recommendation on Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops, complete farm loan waiver and fixation of minimum income for farmers are the key demands that the government should address immediately.We also want the government to fix MSP for milk and vegetables, he added.Supplies hit in RajasthanAlthough the agitation did not affect normal life in Rajasthan, supply of milk, vegetables and other farm produce was hit in Sriganganagar, Hanumangarh and Jhunjhunu districts.We will continue this for the next 10 days and the protest will intensify, said Santveer Singh, a member of the core committee of RKMM in Rajasthan. He said protests were held in Bikaner, Sikar and Nagaur.As the strike began, police in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh have kept a close vigil as the anniversary of the June 6 farmers agitation approaches. Six farmers were killed in police firing during protests last year.In adjacent Neemuch, again there has been not shortage of vegetables and milk although the markets were shut there. Farmers also stayed away from the grain market in Neemuch.Nashik shuts downPolice detained three protesters in Saikheda in Nashik, the nerve centre of the farmers agitations earlier this year. At Khamkheda village in Deola tehsil, tomato farmers threw their produce on the roads.The strike had a strong impact on business at Nashiks main Lasalgaon Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC)  the countrys largest onion market, with sources stating that the price of onions was likely to rise sharply.In Khed Shivapur, farmers condemned the apathy of the Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government by spilling thousands of litres of milk along the Pune-Bengaluru highway.However, business was largely unaffected in most of the major wholesale markets in Mumbai and Pune.(With inputs from Vikas Vasudeva, Shoumojit Banerjee and PTI)"
5b1b01599855b76d57036065,"Mumbai: Vegetable, milk prices unaffected by farmers' strike",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-vegetable-milk-prices-unaffected-by-farmers-strike/articleshow/64437954.cms,2018-06-04,"MUMBAI: The city remains unaffected by the farmers' strike so far given that the usual volume of 550 truckloads arrived at Vashi APMC Saturday. Traders are reporting no shortages. Yet vegetable prices are at the upper end of the normal spectrum as retailers cite spoilage due to summer heat.APMC's former director and wholesale trader Shankar Pingale said, ""The average number of 550 trucks arrived Saturday. The market is closed on Sunday so we will assess the impact on Monday morning. But our farmers are continuing to dispatch produce because they have cultivated a good crop, so we do not expect any shortage or price increase for Mumbaikars.""Most vegetables are selling for Rs 60-80 per kg in retail markets of Khar, Andheri, Chembur, Bhandup, Malad and Borivli.Santosh Kesarwani, a greengrocer at Ahimsa Road, Khar, said, ""The only visible increase has come in tomato which has risen to Rs 25-35 from Rs 16-20 earlier. Spoilage is rampant during summertime and this causes farmers and vendors to charge more. A 25-kg box is being quoted for Rs 800 instead of Rs 400. Also, vegetables grown within Maharashtra are cheaper than those which come from other states. Most of Mumbai's tomato supply arrives from farmlands in Karnataka and transporters are charging more to cover the distance because of the strike.""On Sunday, tomato sold for Rs 40 per kg in certain shops of Chembur and Matunga but remained an average of Rs 25 in parts of Andheri and Bhandup.Cauliflower, lady finger, cluster beans (gavar) all sold for Rs 80 per kg in Andheri East, Khar, Chembur and Bandra East. The typical variation across localities was apparent in the quality and cost of produce.Meanwhile the cost of fruit, especially watermelon has risen owing to the seasonal spike witnessed during the holy fast of Ramzan. A single fruit averaging 2.5 kg sells for Rs 65-70 at Rs 25 per kg. However, alphonso mangoes are available abundant and cheap at Rs 250-350 per dozen as the king of fruit has flooded the market. Lychees have made a grand entry at Rs 60-70 per dozen which should settle to Rs 40 as the days wear on.Milk prices are stable. Cattlesheds in Goregaon and Jogeshwari are unaffected by the milk farmers' agitation. ""We hiked rates of loose milk before Ramzan and are now selling both cow and buffalo milk for Rs 70 per litre,"" said an attendant of Ghaswalla dairy in Jogeshwari. ""The strike does not impact us.""National dairies are doing their best to cope. The spokesperson of Mother Dairy Fruit & Vegetable said, ""We are keeping a close watch on the situation. However, we have made adequate arrangements at our end to ensure (proper) sourcing as well as supplies to the market."

Into its third day on Sunday, Kisan Avkash has already witnessed farmers dumping vegetables and milk on streets to hit supplies to urban centres and lead to a rise in prices.Right now, we are clearing the stock we had, but if trucks dont arrive tomorrow as well, prices will definitely go up, said a wholeseller of potatoes and onions. According to him, wholesale prices of both are currently Rs 600 per crate (50kg), making the retail price at around Rs 20 per kg. This will get worse in the coming days. Already, there was no auction of potatoes held today, he said.So far, price of potatoes and onions have not risen, but the price for tomato is already hit. That too, for tomatoes that are mostly damaged, as a result of a poor crop. Earlier, we used to buy a crate (25 kg) at Rs 30. Now, it has gone up to Rs 300, said a wholeseller for tomatoes. As a result, price of tomato has gone up as almost 100%.Vegetable associations said the price hike is not necessarily because of the strike. Most of the produce at Gurugram mandi doesnt come from parts where farmers are on strike. Potato prices could have increased because cold storages have started stocking up in anticipation.Till recently, vegetables were arriving in excess from areas around Gurugram.That has now fallen, with stock now coming from places further away, adding to transportation cost, said Inder Thakran , president of Gurugram Sabzi Mandi Association.At a retail store in Sikanderpur, retailers said the supply is still the same. The strike has had no impact here, as most of our vegetables come from nearby areas such as Pataudi, Rajasthan, etc, said the store manager at Haryana Kisan Mandi Zone Fresh near Bristol Chowk.However, sellers at the mandi said prices of some vegetables, like French beans, bell peppers and even mangoes, could rise if the strike continues. They added that rising prices could be profitable for them. We get less to sell, but can charge more in profits, said a seller, not wishing to be named.Mangoes have already seen a Rs 15-20 per kg rise, after the rate had dropped around two weeks ago.Authorities at the mandi said not much will change unless strikers start obstructing transport that brings in the vegetables to the city, or if the strike spreads to nearby areas.The recent hike is not because of the strike. Some vegetables cant be procured locally. Sellers here have to buy them from Azadpur mandi in Delhi, said Thakran, referring to bell peppers and French beans."

Two such incidents happened on Saturday morning. At both places, the police had to detain farmers. In Rajasthan, the ongoing strike has started driving up prices of vegetables.In the Sriganganagar and Hanumangarh districts of the desert state, where the bandh call has received maximum support, farmers have set up their own roadside stalls to sell vegetables and milk. They also stopped inter-state trucks supplying milk and vegetables. State cooperative milk tankers were also not spared. They were stopped and milk spilled on the road.

""There is no production of vegetables in Rajasthan in the month of June, it can spell a problem because we will have to rely on existing stock,"" he said, adding that prices of chilli and litchi have soared exponentially.Farmer leaders said that they have been demanding loan waiver, minimum support price for their produces and implementation of Swaminathan committee recommendations. The farmers across the state continue to stop milk tankers of different diary cooperatives to choke the supply of milk.The Jaipur diary officials said that it will not have any adverse effect on the prices, the diary chairman Om Punina had said the problem is restricted to Chomu and Kaladera region only.

5b1b27719855b76d570379f4,The loneliness of Lionel Messi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/football/top-stories/the-loneliness-of-lionel-messi/articleshow/64167670.cms,2018-05-15,"It happened in 2014. With just two minutes remaining, hearts ticking faster than the stadium clock, Messi stood over a free kick. The Argentine faithful prayed for the divine to intervene. It seemed improbable from that distance or width. But it was a sort of moment when miracles happen, dreams come true.The hopes were dashed a moment later.Four years ago, it could have been Lionel Messis night of redemption, glory, fulfilment and maybe even peace. But 1-0 down against Germany, he failed to seize the day.There was a more earthly opportunity earlier, but Messi had rolled the ball wide.The fans wondered: Would he have scored if he was in a Barcelona jersey? The thought was irrelevant, but damning. For, Messi is condemned to bear the cross. He is Atlas Telamon, the enduring Atlas for whom the Golden Ball for Best Player was a burden because his best on the day was not good enough.It would be crossing many lines to place his predicament in such Biblical or mythical proportions. In fact, an Argentine football club recently recreated the Sistine Chapel on the ceiling of its gymnasium, with Diego Maradona as God and Lionel Messi as Adam, although the latters genius on field can sometimes make us forget his tortured soul.Barcelona may have his heart but Argentina has his soul. You read in a Guardian blog that his accent remains Rosarino, his favourite actor is Ricardo Darin and his favourite food is his mothers milanesas with tomato and cheese.Messis wedding last year in his hometown may not have been as simple as his tastes, so do his tax records, but give him a football and the real meaning of jogo bonito comes alive.Possibly there is Cristiano Ronaldo pushing him to the edge and beyond, the sound of broken records and numbing numbers. The endless stats, comparisons, full-page analysis are there for people to gobble, but there is something intangible. A rose doesnt compete with another rose, it simply blooms. There is simplicity, honesty, flavour, joy, intuition, playfulness. It is as though time doesnt exist.And yet time is ticking, ticking away for Messi, all of 30 now.The agony was palpable when a crouched Leo, wallowing in despair, hand on head, chose to call it quits. Having been beaten by Chile in the 2016 Copa America Centenario final, Messis moist eyes conveyed his journey was in vain. He could almost taste the trophy before it was snatched away, before he sent the penalty into heaven. Feeling responsible, he walked away shedding his cloak as Argentinas deliverer. Maybe, he can get back to happiness now at his Nou Camp fortress, away from the scrutiny and remarkable blame. And even hatred (news of his statues being vandalized in Argentina is a common story).Yet, love brought him back. The arrival boards at Buenos Aires airport read: No te vayas Lio: Lio, dont go. Despite all the problems in the Argentine federation and the storm within, the outpouring of affection changed the script.The qualification for next months World Cup was purgation. Argentina, who played under three different coaches, were outside the four qualifying spots going into the final match in Ecuador. Jorge Sampaolis team talk was emotional: Messi does not owe the World Cup to Argentina, but football owes the World Cup to Messi.Argentina were struggling to breathe in the high altitude of Quito, falling behind after 37 seconds. But the heros bright attitude and genius changed everything. A hat-trick, completed by an exquisite dink over the goalkeeper, ensured the flight to Russia and escape from ignominy.Now, Messi with his van Gogh beard, stands in front of the jury again. Perhaps, its been a refreshing season at Barcelona, the early ouster from the Champions League a definite blessing for all those Argentines begging for their messiah to be wrapped up in cotton wool. Perhaps, the resurrection will be complete on July 15 at the Luzhniki Stadium and a new Easter Sunday will be celebrated.Or perhaps, he is just human, destined to fall again. He would have touched the stars anyway. The world, maybe, is not meant for one as beautiful as him.Lets celebrate the Man, or the Messiah. Because we are going to miss Messi when hes gone."

Traders here blame Pakistan governments blanket ban on import of vegetables and soybean from India.A cross-border trader and Federation of Karyana and Dry Fruit Commercial Association president Anil Mehra said, Exporters are left jobless. He said there was apparently no reason behind Pakistan refusing to import vegetables and soybean except that its government had bowed to the diktats of hardliners who did not want to have any relations with India. Not only are we suffering but even labourers and transporters are at loss, said Mehra.A vegetable exporter from Bathinda, Narinder Sharma said, We often talk to our importers in Pakistan, but they are also helpless. They are now buying vegetables at much higher prices than they used to while getting goods from India. He said tomatoes were being sold at around Rs 5 per kg in the wholesale markets in India. Had Pakistan been importing tomatoes, the domestic price would have been more than Rs 20 per kg in wholesale. The Indian government should also take retaliatory action so that Pakistani businessmen also feel the heat of their governments decision, he added.In 2016-17 financial year, the value of exports to Pakistan via Attari ICP was Rs 1,063 crore, which dropped to Rs 744 crore in 2017-18. I cannot comment on the reason for decline of exports to Pakistan through Attari ICP since it is an issue between two countries, commissioner of customs (preventive) Dipak Kumar Gupta told TOI.Giving details of the volume of trade, Attari ICP deputy commissioner Balwinder Singh said India had exported vegetables, cotton/yarn, high density polythene (HDPE), soybean and other items amounting to 2.51 lakh tonnen in 2016-17 in Pakistan while there was no trade of vegetables and soybean to the neighbouring country in 2017-18.Balwinder said overall, they had registered around 30% decline in total exports and around 76% decline in the movement of trucks. He said the Indian imports from Pakistan via ICP registered a minor increase in 2017-18 as compared to the previous year, which also raised the revenue in terms of customs duty. India earned Rs 430.95 crore in customs duty on imports from Pakistan via Attari ICP in 2017-18, up by 77.72% from Rs 242.49 crore in the previous year.In 2016-17, India had imported goods, including dry fruits, dry dates, cement, soda, glass, gypsum rock/powder, aluminium ore and limestone, valued at Rs 2,907 crore from Pakistan via Attari ICP. The value of imports rose by about 17% to Rs 3,403 crore in 2017-18. However, in 2017-18 there was a minor decline in imports of dry dates, soda, glass, and cement from Pakistan.Sources said Pakistan had deliberately banned import of Indian perishable goods to dent the Indian economy and cause resentment among the farming community. As expected, farmers suffered (due to ban). A lot of tomato growers had dumped their produce on roads and staged demonstrations last year. Tomato was otherwise exported to Pakistan via Attari, they said.The foundation stone of Indias first ICP at Attari was laid by former Union home minister P Chidambaram on February 20, 2010, and it was later inaugurated by him on April 13, 2012."

Thanks to a glut in the market and the steepest price drop witnessed in April in nearly a decade, tomatoes have become cheaper than even fodder. Tomato farmers claim they are getting just Rs 2 for every kg of produce, which does not even cover harvesting costs.Usually, tomato prices peak during April because of short supply due to high temperatures. However, statistics available with the Agricultural Marketing Information Network (AGMARKNET) show that the April-2018 prices are the lowest for the vegetable during this month in the past eight years. The tomato glut is evident in the Pune wholesale market as well, where 10 kg of the vegetable is available for between Rs 30 and Rs 80.Shriram Gadhave, the president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India , said this is the first time in several years that prices have hit such a low, almost 60% less than the same period last year. The water table has surged thanks to the rains last year, causing a supply surplus. The prices of many vegetables have dropped because of a glut in markets. Cattle owners in the city and nearby villages have now started taking large quantities of tomatoes and other vegetables left unsold to feed to cattle, he said.ND Ghule, assistant secretary, Agricultural Produce Market Committee, Pune, said the increase in tomato supplies led to a drop in prices. Vegetables such as tomato, eggplant and leaves of beetroot and cauliflower are in demand among them as they have become dirt cheap, he further said.The cattle farmers sometimes take 40 tonnes, or more, at a time for free to feed their cattle, added Sunil Kumbharkar, who owns a vegetable wholesale firm in Market Yard.Ramesh Jadhav, a farmer from Malegaon, says he does not know what to do with his 16-acre tomato plantation. Farmers, who are yet to harvest their tomato crops, are letting cattle loose on their fields so that at least they can be consumed by animals. For the first time in years, the per kilogram price we are getting for tomatoes has plummetted to Rs 2, which does not even meet the harvesting cost, he said. Last year, tomato prices had peaked during April, which is why farmers had sown more tomatoes this year, he said."
5b1b5f599855b76d57039789,Trump hosting glitzy White House state dinner for Macron,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/trump-hosting-glitzy-white-house-state-dinner-for-macron/articleshow/63889373.cms,2018-04-24,"WASHINGTON: Now it's President Donald Trump's turn to pull off the ultimate charm offensive.Wined and dined on multiple state visits during his tour of Asia last year, Trump is paying it forward and celebrating nearly 250 years of U.S.-French relations by playing host to President Emmanuel Macron at a glitzy White House state dinner on Tuesday.Months in the making, it's the first state visit and first big soiree of the Trump era in Washington ""It sounds like what they're planning will be spectacular,"" said Jeremy Bernard, who was White House social secretary in 2014, the last time the U.S. feted a French president.The White House has said little beyond the fact that dinner will be served, sticking to the tradition of trying to maintain an element of surprise for its guests.In fact, Macron will break bread twice with Trump.On Monday, the president and Melania Trump dined privately with Macron and his wife, Brigitte, at Mount Vernon, the home of America's first president, George Washington, on the banks of the Potomac River in Virginia. The White House had said the setting would serve as a reminder of France's ""unique status"" as America's first ally.Trump ended his first year without receiving a foreign leader on a state visit, making him the first president in nearly 100 years to do so and heightening the stakes for Tuesday.Dinner tickets are typically highly sought after by Washington's political and business elite. A few inklings of who's in and who's out already are known: Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, is in, as are House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky was invited, but his office said he is unable to attend.In a break with tradition, Trump invited no Democratic members of Congress or journalists, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the arrangements. But at least one Democrat will be in the crowd: the office of Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards confirmed his attendance.Approximately 150 guests will take their seats in the State Dining Room on Tuesday, making for a more intimate affair than those held by President Barack Obama. Obama's guest lists numbered into the hundreds, requiring that the event be held in a tented pavilion erected on the South Lawn because no room in the White House can accommodate that many people.Most of the responsibility for executing a flawless celebration falls to the first lady and her staff, including such key details as what is served (Trump likes wedge salads and chocolate cake) and poured into glasses (Trump wine?), who sits next to whom, who performs after dinner and what the decor looks like.One big moment is the first glimpse of the first lady in her gown. Fashion details are kept secret until the first couple steps on to the North Portico on Tuesday night to welcome their dinner guests.Former first lady Michelle Obama often used state dinners to showcase the talent of up-and-coming designers. Some designers have cited Trump's politics in refusing to dress the current first lady, a former model. Still, a likely choice would be Dior, the French design house whose fashions Mrs. Trump often wears, or Herve Pierre, the French-American who designed her inaugural gown and other looks.The last time a Republican president hosted his French counterpart was November 2007 when President George W. Bush welcomed the newly divorced Nicolas Sarkozy.More than 100 guests feasted on lobster bisque, lamb with tomato fondue, green beans and sweet potato casserole, salad and dessert served in the State Dining Room. Among the guests were major league baseball pitcher Tom Glavine, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, French chef Guy Savoy and several Louisiana politicians.After dinner, guests strolled down the hall to the East Room to watch performers in the roles of Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette, the Frenchman who served on Washington's staff in the Continental Army. Sarkozy toured Mount Vernon the following day.When Macron's limousine first pulls up the White House driveway on Tuesday morning, Trump, the first lady, White House and administration officials, and hundreds of invited guests will be waiting on the South Lawn. The pomp-filled arrival ceremony is for the man who became the youngest president in French history when he was elected in 2017 at age 39 on his first run for office.The visit also offers Macron his first Oval Office meeting and a joint White House news conference with Trump. There's also a State Department lunch hosted by Vice President Mike Pence before Macron and his wife arrive for the state dinner.The Trump-Macron relationship appeared to get off to a bumpy start with a white-knuckler of a handshake when the political novices met for the first time at a NATO summit in Brussels last May. But Macron likely sealed the bond after Trump accepted his invitation to attend the annual Bastille Day military parade in the center of Paris in July. Macron and his wife also took Trump and the first lady on a tour of Napoleon's tomb and whisked them up into the Eiffel Tower for dinner overlooking the City of Light. The experience led Trump to order up a military parade for downtown Washington later this year.But the two part company on some significant issues, including the Paris climate accord, which Trump withdrew the U.S. from last year, and the Iran-nuclear deal, another multinational agreement that Trump is itching to pull out of. The president did successfully rally Macron and British Prime Minister Theresa May, with whom Trump has sparred, to mount a joint military operation against Syria in response to an apparent chemical attack this month that killed Syrian civilians. Macron still worries about Trump's desire to remove U.S. troops from Syria.An art lover who speaks good English, Macron is known to watch what he eats. Yet he told reporters at an agricultural fair in Paris in February that ""I drink wine at lunch and dinner.""Discerning his tastes, including likes and dislikes, even allergies, is one of the first things the White House tries to pin down for all guests, said Bernard.""You're really focused on making sure the guest feels special,"" he said.Mrs. Trump's social secretary, Rickie Niceta, came aboard last year after two decades of event planning for a caterer whose clients included the White House, the State Department and several embassies, in addition to working on the past five presidential inaugurations, including Trump's. The first lady, who speaks French, also has experienced hands running the kitchen, pastry shop and florist's lair. All three women helped execute more than a dozen state dinners for Obama.Trump owns hotels, including one near the White House, and knows about good hospitality.Bernard recalled that, just as invitations were about to go out for the 2014 dinner for then-French President Francois Hollande, news broke that Hollande and his longtime girlfriend had abruptly split. Mrs. Obama's staff anxiously sought clarity on whether Hollande would bring another date.He didn't, and Bernard dealt with the awkwardness of the situation by seating Hollande between the two Obamas."

Over the years, she came across many people, especially leprosy patients, with open sores and was determined to alleviate their suffering. Last Sunday, Angelin launched Wound Care On Wheels, an initiative wherein she and her team will clean and dress the wounds of those living on the streets.We will be taking dressing materials like betadine, gauze, gloves and approach people in need of help. We will get their permission before we do the dressing, says Angelin, director of The Candles that works in the field of mental and physical health. Along with a couple of colleagues, I will be visiting areas between Purusawalkam and Broadway , she says, adding that the team will start work from Friday and will be visiting the areas twice a week, as dressing needs to be changed.The Candles runs several projects, including awareness programmes on menstrual hygiene in schools and colleges across TN. As part of their project, Amudha Surabhi, the organisation gives health mix porridge to government school children. Feeding the homeless is part of their Share With Care programme. We distribute food thrice a month in the areas between Anna Nagar and Broadway. We get parotta and kurma or idlis from hotels, says Angelin. Or our volunteers cook vegetable or tomato rice.And thats when they came across people on the streets who needed medical aid. Many of them have wounds that are not bandaged properly or are covered with dirty rags, says Angelin. They are hesitant to go to a government hospital as they have to wait in long queues. We did do dressing for a few people but then thought we should have a sustained programme. Angelin, who has done a diploma in hand and leprosy physiotherapy, prefers to use the term Hansens disease instead of leprosy. Stigma still exists around the word leprosy, she says.At the moment, they will be using their own bikes to get around. We are looking for donors who can help us with basic medical supplies or an autorickshaw for us to go around, says Angelin. Psychologist Dr Mini Rao, who has been involved with the NGO for several years says, Many still hesitate to interact with people with leprosy. This initiative will touch several lives."

The spicy mix traditionally comes in a scooped-out potato cup (kulle) but vendors are now experimenting with fruits, tomato and cucumber as the base. Made popular by food walks, this new avatar of kulle chaat is lapped up by tourists and shoppers in Chawri Bazaar and Sitaram Bazaar, but Purani Dilli frowns on these upstarts who have tinkered with the original.How can you make kulle with tomato? agonises Ashok Mathur , 48, a fifth-generation Old Delhi resident, who has grown up eating Sultans Kulle in his neighbourhood. Kulle used to be only made of aloo or shakarkandi (sweet potato). The spicier, the better! This was followed by a cup of tea, Mathur recounts, sitting in his 100-year-old home in Roshanpura.Arun Kashyap , 32, sits at the same spot where his great grandfather, Sultan Singh, parked himself on a raised platform outside a Jain household, in a narrow bylane that runs parallel to Nai Sadak Kashyap says he has grown up hearing tales of the legendary Mukesh  the singers family lived in Old Delhis Chelpuri  eating kulle made by his great grandfather when he was a roaming hawker with a khomcha (stand).Banana was the first fruit our family experimented with for customers who liked fruit chaat but didnt want the traditional aloo as the base for kulle. Now, we make it with more fruits but the regulars insist on aloo, says Kashyap, who also serves aloo chaat and tikki.The aloo is sand-baked at a bhatti in the Old Subzi Mandi area in the morning. By afternoon it reaches Roshanpura, where Kashyap scoops out the middle to make space for the filling.He starts with a few pinches of a homemade masala which, Kashyap says, has 36 ingredients. This is followed by boiled chana (small chickpeas), kala namak, roasted jeera powder, black pepper, boora (powdered sugar), pomegranate seeds, a squeeze of lemon and finally topped with sliced ginger.This was a vantage point when Sultan set up base here 80 years ago; but changing demography and competition from chaat vendors on the main roads, have made life tough for his great grandson.But support from the local community has kept Sultans kulle going. We use the space outside a Jain familys house but they dont charge us. They let us store our wares inside, and even pay for the kulle they consume, says Kashyap.His chaat still draws members of the Mathur families, who once occupied most houses in this neighbourhood. Today, the homes have given way to shops and godowns. Sultans masala runs in our blood, says Ashok Mathur, talking nostalgically about how people used to choke the lane during Ramlila celebrations to relish the kulle served on dhak patta.So, next time you take Nai Sadak to cross over from the food streets of Chandni Chowk to Jama Masjid , do try out this palate cleanser."

As a team they will support each other with the start-ups, he said.In their first start-up idea, they are planning to collect carrot, beetroot, tomato and onion from Oddanchatram vegetable market in Dindigul , the Asia's biggest vegetable market, when the prices of these vegetables nosedive.They will store them in state-of-art cold storage facility and further dehydrate it without any disturbance to its aroma and nutrient content.Such packed vegetables will be exported when prices are down and sold in urban areas when their prices go up again. They will be working on this project in first phase, students said."

Unable to recover even the production cost, distressed farmers are dumping the produce in fields and on roads in Sehore, Narsinghpur and Raisen districts.Market reports disclosed price of tomato crashed to Re 1 and even 50 paisa per kg in some districts forcing farmers to seek government intervention. Reports from Sehore - the home district of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Narsinghpur and Raisen- reveal price variation is hitting farmers hard.In Budhni (Sehore) and Gadarwara (Narsinghpur) dumping of tomato on the roadside has become a common sight. Tomato growers said there was a glut in the market as more farmers took to its cultivation, . Moreover, a slump in demand in neighbouring states also contributed to the crash in price. Farmers in more than a 12-13 districts cultivated tomato on a large scale, resulting in lesser demand for tomatoes, they said.""In August-September last year, farmers sold tomatoes for as high as Rs 50 to Rs 70 per kg due to high demand. Now, the price has crashed to 50 to 60 paisa a kg in the wholesale market, which is less than the production cost. But in retail, the crop is being sold for Rs 10 per kg. Farmers are compelled to dump tomatoes on roadside as a mark of protest,"" said a farmer of Gadarwara.In Nasarullaganj and Shahganj - the two main areas under the assembly constituency of the chief minister- farmers are not even able to recover transportation cost. Mahesh , a farmer from Shahganj claimed in a field of two acre, he spent Rs 10,000 on seeds, Rs 9,000 on pesticides, Rs 3,000 on irrigation and Rs 50,000 on labour. But, could not recover the cost for which he had drawn a bank loan of Rs 5 lakh. Minister of state for agriculture Balkrishna Patidar said those who are dumping tomatoes on roadside are not farmers, but protesters. Farmers never dump their hard-earned produce. Farmers know well the price fluctuation. Otherwise they would not have opted for tomato crop, the minister said.""The demonstrations are planned and farmers are not involved in dumping of their produce. Price fluctuation is a normal process. At times, farmers had earned Rs 50 per kg, when there was a demand. Now, they have to sell it at a lesser margin. Had farmers not earned benefit last year, they would not have opted for the same crop this year,"" Patidar told TOI."

The market authorities claim that the area is cleaned twice a day.The garbage bins are almost overflowing and even the space outside the shops is littered with leftovers. Rotting vegetables and fruits seems to be scattered on the road. During a visit to the grain market on Tuesday, the TOI team found few of the shopkeepers dumping rotten tomato and potato in the open and on the streets. Due to this, the passersby and customers looking for vegetables and fruits were facing a lot of problems. The market's roadsides were full of dirt, junk material, and garbage.Some of the vendors had pitched their carts on the muddy patches and their vegetables and fruits witnessed had dirt all over. And many people were buying these items, too. To the naked eye, these items seemed injurious to health. The loading and unloading of trucks was in progress on the main road inside the market, which had jammed this passage.Vegetable peels flies into the eyes of the customers and commuters. Even many of the shopkeepers sitting in the ground were found to be uncomfortable because of the stinking environment they had created themselves. Dustbins in the market had not been emptied in days. Most of these were either broken or not in a usable condition. Encroachment around the main gate and the inside main road was rampant. Rows and rows of trucks occupied the middle of the road. The other vehicles didn't have space to even squeeze past.Sector-26 grain market secretary M K Sharma said: ""Every day, we collect garbage in the trollies. This problem recurs after every spell of rain and we had been facing it for the past many years. All problems stem from the disorderly traffic. One of the alternatives is to shift the grain market to Sector 39. Because of the crowd, we are unable to collect waste from each corner. This waste is dumped outside the city. The marked generates waste in bulk indeed.""Bablu, a shopkeeper at the grain market, said: ""This market is cleaned twice a day but most of the shopkeepers chuck their waste on to the road and litter the interior areas as well. Even though they are responsible for the problem, most of the big shopkeepers do not accept their responsibility or behave in a disciplined manner.""The customers at the market attributed many problems to all the dirt, garbage, and unpleasant smell generated from the place. Sector 28 resident Sheetal Chaturvedi said: ""The market doesn't have toilet facilities. The MC officials and the market committee have not taken appropriate steps for the improvement of civic facilities in the area."""
