With market forces, particularly commission agents, influencing prices in the regulated markets, farmers often struggled to get remunerative prices. In fact, tomato growers throwing their dumping their produce during peak season has become a routine affair. During these events, farmers blamed the traders syndicate.After carefully studying the situation, the state government issued a GO de-notifying vegetables and fruits from Andhra Pradesh Markets (agriculture produces and livestock) Act. The de-notification will reduce the price gap between producers and consumers through reduction in intermediary supply chain and creation of alternative marketing channels, said agriculture minister Somireddy Chandramohan Reddy . He said it would also promote investment on development of marketing infrastructure with private sector participation.The move is expected to bring down the prices in the retail market as growers are free to sell the stocks anywhere in the state besides enhancing farmers profit. The market yards, however, have been allowed to collect user charges from the buyers ."

Balwant, who owns around 40 acre farmland on very tough terrain, is a worried man as the prices of tomatoes have crashed. A vehicle full of tomato crates sent to Kalamna wholesale market was brought back without selling the produce, since it was fetching a very low price of Rs50 a crate, which comes to just Rs2 a kg. The recent weather has weakened the yield and reduced its shelf life, said Balwant, who, left with no option, decided to feed the tomato yield to his cattle.Balwant said it doesnt make sense to sell tomatoes at Rs2 a kg as it does not recover even the basic expenses involved like seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, transportation and commission to agents.Pandurang Tarare, another villager involved in traditional farming, said he too was very depressed when he heard that the rates of tomatoes have gone below Rs50 per crate. He plans to wait another week, otherwise he would also feed the yield to his bullocks. He said the Centre should do something as farmers are facing hardships, especially in Vidarbha region.Shriram Ghadhave, president of Vegetable Growers Association of India (VGAI), said Maharashtra has seen a 10-15% rise in area under cultivation for tomatoes. Previously, farmers from western Maharashtra used to go for vegetable crops but in recent times farmers from Vidarbha and Marathwada too have started growing vegetables. He also attributed this growth to the good rainfall in the state last year. As against 2.5 lakh hectares of tomato cultivation, this year we have about 3 lakh hectares, he said.Lately, farmers have increased cultivation of vegetables as it ensures cash flow in the short term. This takes care of their immediate needs. However, as the number of farmers growing vegetables apart from their main stay crop has increased, it has led to an oversupply as well. Its not only tomato, rates of other vegetables like brinjal, ladyfinger and cauliflower too have gone down throughout the region, said farmers as well as farm activists.Locally grown vegetables, including tomatoes, are fetching a price within Rs2-4 a kg. In some cases, its just a couple of rupees, say market sources.Kishore Tiwari of Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission (VNSSM)  the state government agency to tackle farm crisis  said if its tomatoes in Nagpur, in Yavatmal farmers have ended up in losses in brinjal and ladyfinger.The rates of main crops like soyabean and cotton are already down. Now, there is a slump in vegetables which are grown to supplement income by farmers. There is no system of MSP for vegetables, he said.Farmers having irrigation facilities used to go for crops like wheat or gram. These days, vegetables are being preferred as well. This has led to a glut in Wardha. Farmers are not able to recover expenses in cauliflower cultivation, said Vijay Jawandhia, a former Shetkari Sanghathana activist from Wardha.Vijay Ingle from Akola, a farmer who had bagged state government award for best practices, also confirmed that in his area farmers were setting aside an acre or half for vegetables. The rates are down due to oversupply, he said.Meanwhile, Nandkishore Gaur, president of vegetable traders at Kalamna Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) yard, said rates are expected to increase in the coming months.Tomatoes are reaped for four months, so farmers have a chance to recover their losses. Normally, the crop is grown in the month of October. However, these days large number of farmers in areas like Ramtek and Tumsar Road in Nagpur district have gone for the January crop, which will continue till April. At the same time, there are arrivals from other states like bordering Madhya Pradesh and Telangana as well. The supplies will recede after April, and the rates are expected to increase then, he said."

The rising temperature has caused a fall in groundwater level and reduced crop yield. The Koyambedu wholesale vegetable market, which used to receive 400-450 truckloads of vegetables every day three months ago, received only 350 loads on Friday.In three months, the price of green beans has gone up from Rs15-Rs20 per kg to Rs30-Rs50 per kg at the Koyambedu market. At neighbourhood retail stores, green beans was selling for Rs60 per kg on Friday.Yield from the years second crop (April to June) is 30% less than the yield from first crop which is harvested from December to March. Prices of tomato, beetroot, cauliflower, radish and turnip have increased by about 30%, while prices of onion, sambar onion, capsicum and brinjal have decreased marginally. Prices of all vegetables will rise from the third week of April by 10%, according to Koyambedu Wholesale Traders Welfare Association treasurer P G M Sukumar.Sukumar said, Prices began to go up from the first week of March last year due to a failed monsoon. This year, however, prices will only rise gradually, thanks to sufficient rainfall. Except for coastal Andhra, all other parts of the southern peninsula registered normal rainfall during the recent northeast monsoon.Prices of tomato in April last year was Rs18, while this year it is only Rs10-Rs12. Likewise, the price of carrot was Rs35 last year compared to Rs15-Rs20 this year."

When I checked the root, it looked as if it had galls. Galls are knot-like structures caused by root-knot nematodes. But, we were not sure about it as root-knot nematodes in citrus were not present in Tamil Nadu, she said.Poornima visited the farm and dug up a live sapling. We found that the sapling was infected with root-knot nematodes. In the past few months, we found instances of root-knot nematode infections in citrus saplings in farms in Coimbatore and Erode districts. Researchers here are working on battling the nematode, she said.Nematodes enter the roots of fruit, vegetable and flower saplings through the root tip. After two to three months, they breed and block the conducting vessels of the plant, causing it to wilt. Root-knot nematodes, meanwhile, enter the roots, where they lay eggs, which form knot-like structures that bulge out of the root. The knots then rupture and the young nematodes go in search of new roots.Nematodes mainly affect fruit and vegetable crops such as tomato, guava, pomegranate, cucumber and capsicum, said Poornima. Tomato and cucumber plants are the major victims, she added.There are also instances where there have been heavy losses in guava, said the head of nematology department, S Subramanian. Over the past four to five years, several new varieties of guava were introduced in the state. They have been affected by nematodes and have caused severe losses to farmers, he added. The annual loss in fruit crops due to nematodes was pegged at 13%, he said.The department has been researching how to tackle the nematode menace and also has been helping farmers and nursery owners. Beneficial fungi such as Paecilomyces and Pochonia are known to inhibit nematode growth, said Poornima. We have been producing the fungi and selling it to farmers. The fungi can be mixed with soil or the saplings can be dipped in the liquid formation of the fungi before being planted. Also, simple methods such as exposing the soil to sunlight will kill nematodes, she added.The department has been conducting awareness workshops on nematodes for both farmers and nursery owners, Poornima added."

The initiative was conceived earlier this year by teachers to encourage students to be senitive to the environment.The school has started an eco-club and roped in students as members. Manoj Kumar, head teacher, said, I joined the school nine months ago. At that time, there was not a single plant in the school. So, we asked students to go to neighbouring areas and collect old plants.Students managed to collect at least 170 plants in a week after which the school got in touch with Give me trees, a Delhi-based NGO which focuses on community-based voluntary tree planting and conservation. The trust asked us if hydroponic plantation could be introduced in the school and we agreed to do the same, said Kumar.Give me trees roped in Honda, which donated Rs 3.5 lakh from its CSR funds for the project. Vaneet Bhalla, a volunteer with Give me trees, said, The concept of hydroponics is new in the country but it gives big results. It involves growing healthy plants without the use of a traditional soil medium, using a nutrient and mineral-rich water solution. Hydroponic plantation requires less water in comparison to the traditional way. A hydroponic plant needs some nutrients, water, and sunlight and all this is available in the school.The school chose its rooftop to set up the garden. The plants are put on pipes. This requires less space as the plants grow vertically, said Bhalla.Students look after the plants. Vegetables such as cabbage, capsicum, green chilli, ladys finger and tomato are grown. When the vegetables are fully grown, we will distribute them among students, said Kumar.The system requires the school to ensure water circulation through hydroponic pipes. The school makes two teachers stay in the school overnight to switch on the motor when water supply is there. The school has eight teachers. We dont have helpers such as gardeners or guards. So, we decided to take care of this ourselves. We stay in the school to switch on the motor in the evening and early morning. We also sprinkle organic pesticides on the plants, said Manjeet Mann , a teacher.The school plans to increase the number of hydroponic plants to 3,500 in the next couple of days. Sub-divisional magistrate Sanjeev Singhla said, I really appreciate the work students have done to grow soil-less plants. Other schools should also encourage this initiative."

Prices of regular varieties like rohu, katla, tangra and pabda have shot up by Rs 75-150 a kg following a surge in demand.While fish has always been a part of the daily diet of an average Bengali household, now even other communities, who prefer meat for their dietary needs, have suddenly discovered their love for fish. In Bengali households where mutton and chicken dishes usually figure on the Sunday menu, it has been fish all the way these past couple of weeks.Not just homes, even restaurants and caterers have reported a shift from mughlai, continental and Chinese cuisines to Bengali that has a wide variety of fish dishes on the menu.Price of fish across categories has gone up by 17-20% in the wholesale market. It is a record high. We have never traded fish at this price, said Howrah Wholesale Fish Market Association secretary Syed Anwar Maqsood.The rise in fish prices in the wholesale market has translated to an even steeper hike in retail prices, but the demand surge has not led to a supply shortage. State fisheries minister Chandrakanta Sinha confirmed there was enough supply in the market to meet the demand. Yet, prices have continued to soar.At municipal markets in Gariahat, Lake Market, New Market and Manicktala, price of katla has shot up from Rs 240 a kg a couple of weeks ago to Rs 350-400. Rohu has gone up from Rs 130 to Rs 160-170.Market observers put the sharp hike in prices to opportunism at the retail end. A retail fish seller senses the demand and accordingly hikes the price to maximise his profit. That is whats happened, said Jagannath Raut of Behala wholesale fish market.Caterers are having a harrowing time with clients demanding major changes in the menu at the 11th hour. According to Sandip Das of Diamond Caterer, mutton and chicken items have nearly disappeared from the menu. Now everyone is demanding that meat items be replaced by fish and prawn. This has thrown the costing of dishes haywire, said Das.We are reinventing a lot of fish dishes to stay afloat, said Sujoy Ghosh of Bhawanipores Ghosh Caterers. Reshmi kebab and mutton do peyazja have been replaced with prawn cutlet and fish coriander. Baked tomato betki has edged out roast mutton.In restaurants, too, fish and prawn items are moving faster than usual. Peter Cat and Mocambo owner Nitin Kothari said the slump in demand for chicken and mutton items was significant.Metro Cash and Carry, the leading business-to-business wholesaler that supplies both meat and fish to most big hotels and restaurants in the city, has also experienced a sharp rise in demand for fish."
