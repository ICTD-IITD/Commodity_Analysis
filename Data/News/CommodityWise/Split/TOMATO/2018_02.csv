He begins stalking her. After a few days of resistance, the girl gives in and Roadsidehas his way.This may be the standard plot of Indian cinemas -- with the audience hooting and cheering the hero on, when he does so -- but few realize the devastating effect it has on women when some brainless desperados start emulating this plot in real life.A 25-year-old woman working as an auditor in a private firm went through a horrendous time when she moved tofrom Berhampur () some nine months back. It started with some unknown persons ringing the bell and running away but soon spiralled into house invasion, spraying of noxious substances and writing love letters with tomato ketchup.So much so that the hapless woman has left the city temporarily and will vacate the house -- where she lives with her brother -- once she returns. Before leaving for her hometown, she filed a complaint with the Madiwala police. A case has been lodged under section 354-D (which deals with punishment for a person who follows a woman and contacts, or attempts to contact, her to foster personal interaction repeatedly despite a clear indication of disinterest) of the Indian Penal Code.The brother-sister duo stay on the second floor of a multi-storied building at Venkatapura, in Madiwala. In his complaint, the brother has said that although his sister moved in with him nine months back, the desperados have been troubling her for the past two months. My sister is traumatised. She has fallen sick after inhaling some noxious spray that the perverts sprayed on her a couple of days ago. I took her home after getting her treated for stomach pain and fever, the brother, who did not wish to be named, told Mirror.The incident that he is referring to took place on May 22 at 10.40 am. While his sister Divya (name changed) was in the washroom, the perverts climbed the building and sprayed some chemical even as they Main Maar Doonga (I will kill) in Hindi. Divya managed to drag herself out of the bathroom and called her friend who stays nearby and her brother who was in office at that time. Her friend reached the house but Divya had bolted it from inside. My sister was not able to get up and open the door. I reached home and managed to get inside to find her very sick. We took her to the hospital and then filed a complaint with the police, her brother said.Divya said she works the night shift and trouble generally starts when her brother leaves for office in the morning. I sleep during the day. For the past two months, somebody had been ringing the bell between 10.30 am and 2 pm. But when I open the door, there would be nobody. The pattern used to repeat every three to four days. But it doesnt happen on Sundays when my brother is home, she added.The brother-sister duo even tried to catch the culprits red-handed, with disastrous, near-fatal results. I had taken my sister out shopping and decided to catch them when we returned home. I stayed back in the opposite building while my sister stood in the corridor outside our main door. Two youths in their mid-twenties appeared and my sister raised an alarm. They pushed her from behind and she almost fell from the corridor but managed to balance herself by holding on to the parapet. I rushed to catch the duo but couldnt find them, he said. After the incident, they approached the Madiwala police who checked the building and suspicious persons around it. When they found nothing, they asked us to call them if we found the miscreants again, he said.He then installed two CCTV cameras in the corridor. But they did not come for at least three days. Then, my sister found a letter in the bathroom; it had love quotes and one-liners written with tomato ketchup. They started dropping letters from bathroom window daily. Once they wrote 2 camera ha ha, he said, adding the quotes were in English, Telugu and Kannada. Next day we got another letter warning us of dire consequences if we complained to the police. After five days, there was a rotten smell in the bathroom; initially, my sister suspected it to be gas leakage or acid cleaning. After a couple of days, she again noticed the putrid smell, he said. We dont know if someone known to us is doing this, but they are observing my sisters movements and targeting her. She is scared it could be black magic too, he added.Madiwala police said they had collected CCTV footage from the building and will nab the miscreants at the earliest.Till then, Divyas nightmare will continue; just like Kirans (played by Juhi Chawla) in Darr."

Several well-known faces from different walks of life came down to catch the show. Over popcorn and colas, movie lovers were seen having a blast watching Laltu Biswas & Co. unfold a laughter riot. Once the screening drew to a close, many didnt wait to greet directors Nandita Roy and Shiboprosad Mukherjee but smothered them with haamis.Little Brata Banerjee, who was catching the show with friends Tiyasha Paul and Aviraj Karan, said hed rather run away before the show ends. Cholo palai, he said. On being asked the reason, the seven-year-old said, Cant you see people waiting to pull my cheeks? If they were throwing tomatoes at me, I would have been happier. This love is becoming unbearable. Tiyasha, who was busy with her half-yearly exams, said she could finally enjoy all the love showered on her.Who said directors cant be friends? Kaushik Ganguly, Sudeshna Roy and Abhijit Guha were seen thoroughly enjoying the special screening of the film. I am all for films that educate, said Kaushik. Those who watched the film were all praise for the director duos take on theeducation system.Tolly women Arpita Chatterjee, Nusrat Jahan, Tonushree Chakraborty and Mimi Chakraborty turned up the heat at the screening. Looking chic in red and pink co-ords, Nusrat turned heads. Mimi, who has lost oodles of weight, was looking her prettiest best in a blush yellow top and black distressed jeans. Both Arpita and Tonushree made a splash in cool casuals."

But he eventually spent more time studying chemistry and obtained his PhD in 1899.Sorensen did most of his research in Carlsberg Laboratories. He became the director of its chemical section in 1901. While at Carlsberg, Sorensen started to study amino acids, proteins and enzymes.As hydrogen ion concentration played a key role in enzymatic reactions he devised a simple way of expressing it, according to EuCheMS, the European Association for Chemical and Molecular Sciences.He found that by taking a negative logarithm of hydrogen ion concentration a convenient scale can be established. This is the well-known pH value.He also developed buffer solutions to maintain constant pH of solutions (Sorensen buffers), EuCheMS noted in a short biography of the scientist in its website.The Google Doodle on Tuesday allows users to see for themselves the pH value of different food items, including tomatoes and eggs in a scale of 1 to 14.Sorensen retired from his post at Carlsberg in 1938. He died in Copenhagen in 1939.(With inputs from IANS)"

You can have them scrambled, boiled, curried, poached, baked, basted, fried sunny side up and even whisked raw in coffee. Additionally, they play the role of binder, thickener, emulsifier and vitalizer. Want to give definition and bounce to your hair? Simply slap an egg on your scalp!As a protein source, eggs are a delight for both weight-watchers and those building muscle. But none desires eggs more than the hungry soul who is either low on budget or shorn of a wholesome eating option late at night.Shabbir Shaikh comes to the rescue here. The 39-year-old has been running a handcart selling egg dishes outside the Shivajinagar railway station for the past 20 years. He conducts business till 3am, moving his cart into a nondescript lane adjoining the station after midnight.On an average, Shaikh uses 300 eggs daily but sticks to just three dishes  bhurji, omelette and half fry (renamed palti if flipped over). Each dish, which comes with four pavs, is priced at Rs 50 till midnight and Rs 60 thereafter. Interestingly, Shaikh says rail and bus passengers are not his chief clientele  word of mouth about his food draws in regular customers from as far as Pimpri and Hinjewadi.Like Shaikh, most stalls and handcarts in the city restrict their egg menu to not more than four or five dishes. Yash Pawar, owner of Pune Egg Cafe on Senapati Bapat Road, says this is very unlike Gujarat, especially Surat and Vadodara, where stalls have around 25-30 different egg dishes on their list.The 24-year-old Pawar, who grew up in Vadodara and came here to study at Symbiosis, has more than 50 egg items on his menu, with the average pricing being Rs 100. He says his chef, who is from Vadodara, can rustle up 300 types of egg dishes. Pawar offers eggs in rice, gravies and parathas, and as starters or omelettes. His trademark dishes are the ghotala (of Surat fame), boiled egg tikka masala and egg-kheema rice. And, yes, the place satisfies late-night food cravings.Pawar says he uses only Amul butter for his dishes. So does Dnyaneshwar Narvankar, the franchise owner of the newly-started eggs-only Raju Omlet at Vimannagar. Now, the Omlet is no typo; it has been retained in the name boards of all 12 outlets of the brand  six of them in Gujarat and one each in Mumbai, Pune, Dubai, Sharjah, Pattaya and the US.All outlets have a fixed menu of 13 dishes, and each dish uses 50 gms of butter. The dishes are priced up to Rs 170, and the best-sellers are the green boiled egg tikka and the crush omelette. Narvankar says the outlets do not believe in experimenting with too many dishes, though he points out that one can find more than 1,000 egg recipes across Gujarat. The Vadodara outlet, from where the business started, uses a whopping 1,500 eggs a day.At Sangvi, Shriram Pawar operates a food truck which offers 111 egg dishes from evening to midnight. The 34-year-old, who spent a year in a similar business in Surat, claims to be the only one in Maharashtra to offer the intriguingly-named egg pomfret. Well, this dish is basically an omelette fried adequately to earn a texture like the skin of a fish. The omelette is then folded and shaped like a pomfret. It is stuffed with chopped cooked egg whites and cheese before being dunked into a plateful of tomato-based gravy.Pawar, who uses around 200 eggs per day, says each of his myriad dishes has a unique taste. An exhaustive menu like his would be found in many places in Gujarat, he points out. There, eggs have an acceptability factor among the largely vegetarian population, even though they may not be eaten at home."

Hira Singh Vegetable Wholesale Market, locally known as Azadpur mandi, said prices of tomatoes, onions, and potatoes had increased.Disruption in supplyThe vendors said potato stock was influenced the least and the price of onions rose only slightly. However, tomato sellers complained of disruption in supply.Subhas Seti, a tomato vendor for the past 47 years, said while 70 vehicles is the norm, only 12 made deliveries on June 2, the second day of the protest. Other wholesalers had similar experiences.Dashrat Kumar, a vendor at Azadpur mandi for the past 12 years, said the supply of tomatoes was considerably low on June 2. He said the price of tomatoes almost doubled when only five of the usual 50 trucks of produce arrived.Anil Kumar, a tomato seller since 1990, sold his stock for Rs. 15 per kg, Rs. 5 higher than last week, because only four of a total of 40 supply trucks were on duty. When asked about the reason for such few trucks, he said the drivers were worried about local agitation and damage to their vehicles in transit.Vendors sympathiseDespite the disruption in vegetable supplies, many vendors at Azadpur mandi sympathised with the farmers.Although Mohammed Javed, a potato vendor, reported an approximate 10% reduction in stock, he said, The farmers are not getting enough money so it is natural that they will be upset and want to strike.While potato prices have not fluctuated significantly, those working with commission agents, like Javed, have suffered losses. The commission agents responded to the strike by increasing their rate of commission by about Rs. 4 per kg, added Javed and other potato sellers at Azadpur mandi. However, many vegetable retailers in the city did not report any significant price fluctuations. Dinesh Kumar, a retailer in Razapur, said, As of now, there is no change in the rate of tomatoes and onions.Asked about what the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) in Delhi was doing to ameliorate the situation, APMC chairperson Adil Ahmad Khan said, What will the APMC do? Our stock comes from outside, so the Modi government has to listen to the farmers demands.Khan confirmed the high prices of tomatoes and said that rates had almost doubled on June 2 due to the perishable nature of the produce.(With inputs fromUrvashi Sharma)What will the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee do?

I hope that is the correct spelling of achhe and its not achhoo as my autocorrect is suggesting. My father says the right spelling is chee but I think he is editorialising.So wherever you are, whoever you are, extend both your arms  dont feel shy, this is a time to celebrate  and pat yourselves on the back. If you cant reach your own back because you are too fat, do it using your social media handle, or the handle of your trishul. But do it for sure  because you deserve it.A ridiculous notionYou silly goose! Deserve it my foot! I was just joking, to see how seriously you take me. And you all are really patting yourselves on the back?! This has to be the height of self-delusion. Do you people really believe the credit for all that India has achieved in the last four years goes to each one of you? I am asking a genuine question here and I want a genuine answer: are all of you megalomaniacs? Did you really think each of you is collectively responsible for the progress of this great nation? I am shocked to hear that you would entertain even for one second such a ridiculous, blasphemous notion. Never forget that all the good things happening in our country right now is because of one man  and we all know who that is.What makes me really sad is that all of you got four years  four entire years  to fulfil every one of our beloved Prime Ministers dreams. And yet, you have let him down so badly. Each one of you. True, the Indian economy is still growing at 12.7% per annum, we are still creating 4.2 crore jobs every year, and farmers are so happy that they are giving away milk and tomatoes for free. It is also true that we have eliminated corruption through demonetisation, achieved 200% tax compliance through GST, and deposited Rs. 15 lakh in the bank account of every Indian who worked in the IT Cell for a minimum of 56 days.Nor can anyone deny that today, white people in different parts of the world look at brown Indians with more respect than ever before. Foreigners are so much in awe of our Prime Minister that when they translate his speeches they add five extra paragraphs free of charge. After 60 years of Dark Ages under the Congress, today every Indian village has woken up to light and Paytm.Four great featsIn fact, Modiji routinely achieves in any given week 100 times more than what Nehru accomplished from 1947 to 2014. But the pseudo-sickular Indian media that has sold out to the hate-Modi industry simply wont show them to the Indian public. If you think I am being too harsh, Ill give you just four examples of Modijis historic achievements, all from the last one week, which have been completely blacked out by the paid-cum-stung media.Im betting you didnt know, for instance, that for the first time in Indias 30,000-year-history, an orchid was named after an Indian Prime Minister when the Singapore government decided to name a beautiful Indic orchid that produces upright inflorescences up to 56 inches long, Dendrobrium Narendra Modi. Or that Modiji became the first Indian Prime Minister to visit a Mariamman temple in Singapore. Were you aware that the IAEA has hailed the achievement of electrifying all Indian villages as the greatest event in the history of every energy, including physical, kinetic, potential, sexual, and weed energy? Or that for the first time in Indias history, an Indian Prime Minister purchased a Madhubani painting in Singapore using a RuPay card? Do you know how many Madhubani paintings Nehru bought using a RuPay card, either in India or in Singapore? Zero. Thats right. If Modiji and Nehru were to settle things between them through a tennis match, Modiji would win by an innings and 545 runs.The one thing we couldnt doThats the kind of Prime Minister weve been blessed with the last four years  someone who not only works 23 hours a day but never boasts about it in his own words. In return, he had only one small request for all of us: a Congress-mukt Bharat. And Im sorry to say, as a nation, we have failed miserably in this.As the Karnataka elections and the recent bypoll results showed, not only is India far from being Congress-mukt, the entire Opposition is ganging up against one man. And you all are sitting quietly and watching like Gandhijis monkeys? After all that he has done for you, if you cant even ensure another five years of Achhe Din in 2019, I must say you are not fit to remain in this country. I suggest you pack off to Pakistan and while you are there, dont forget to watch Veeradi Veera Wedding with your jihadi grandmother."

Each packet would contain a minimum of five varieties of vegetable seeds. We are making the seed sourcing and processing facility a permanent mechanism to help the State achieve vegetable self-sufficiency. Quality seeds would be supplied to all the needy, including farmers, schools, institutions, households and NGOs, said Thomas Cheriyan, manager of the processing plant of the VFPCK at Alathur here.The agency, which completed 21 years this month, will soon start a Statewide campaign promoting organic vegetable cultivation. Talking to The Hindu , Thomas Cherian said the State needs quality seeds and seedlings to achieve self-sufficiency in cultivation of pesticide-free vegetables.50% deficitThe State now faces a 50% deficit in its vegetable requirements. We are attempting to bridge the gap, he said.The packing of seeds for distribution among students has been conducted using the services of 2,000 women volunteers of Kudumbasree. All the 13 seed-packing centres in the region would be converted into permanent entities.Ensuring supplyApart from seeds, the VFPCK would ensure the supply of vermicompost, coir pith compost, powdered cow dung, cow urine, panchagavya, fish amino acid, EM solution, neem cakes, bone meal, grow bag, and seedling trays to vegetable growers.600 tonnes of seedIn its 21 years of existence, the council has generated and supplied around 600 tonnes of seeds from the Alathur unit.It has also ensured Palakkad the prime position on the vegetable cultivation map of Kerala."

This used to be a one-and-done ordeal... However, with Ghostbusters , Hollywood took a big swing on a female-led project, and didnt overreact to its failure, he wrote.The premise of What Women Want (2000)  Mel Gibson as a marketing executive who is suddenly able to hear womens thoughts  lends itself more obviously to a gender-flipped remake than most.Taraji P. Henson, who does the honours in What Men Want (2019), said her role was an empowering statement for women, but also a learning experience.You kind of just brush it off as men like sex, eating and farting. I was like, How are they going to make this interesting? said the Empire and Hidden Figures star. But then I read the script and Im like, Wow, men are really insecure about their looks, just like women! I think thats going to be great, for women to see that.Ensemble of womenSome Hollywood watchers have argued that while female-flipping may seem progressive, in reality it militates against those really fighting pay inequality, harassment and other forms of sexism.Even though I can get excited for a movie like Oceans 8 ... at the end of the day it still seems to signify that womens movies still need some sort of male appeal to get made, said Hazel Cills of female-focused pop culture website Jezebel.A gender-swapped movie implies that women arent important enough to get their own, original stories, and thus must piggy-back on franchises helmed by men that have already proven to be successful.It was an issue that came up when Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett and the rest of the Oceans 8 cast hosted a news conference at New Yorks Metropolitan Museum of Art earlier this month.Ms. Bullock admitted that initially she honestly didnt think it would work, or get made while Ms. Blanchett agreed that, a few short years ago, such a project would have been out of the question."

Orders are placed online, priced at 32 per person, from a choice of four curries, a vegetarian side dish and naan.Since Sake Dean Mohamed from Patna opened Londons first Indian restaurant called Hindoostane Coffee House in Marylebone in 1810, the Indian food industry has grown exponentially and is worth 4 billion today.It is a different matter that curry in Britain stands for dishes vastly different from what they are known as back home, and at least one Indian dish is a purely British invention: chicken tikka masala or CTM, endowed with the status of national dish by former foreign secretary Robin Cook.CTM, no surprise,is one of the four curries on offer, the others being Lamb Balti, Bangal Naga Chicken and Paneer Korai (veg). The food will be flown to Bordeaux Saucats Airfield, located in the heart of the Pessac-Lognan wine region, where it will be served to customers.James Emery, a France-based British aviation trainer who thought of the idea with Faz Ahmed of Akash, told The Times: Indian food in France is standardised for French tastes and Ive never had anything that resembles what you get in an Indian takeaway in Britain.Its a bit of a hare-brained scheme but we love flying and we love curries and we thought it would get the year off to a good start. Everything is a bit miserable, what with Brexit, and I thought it would be good to have some fun.Orders can only be placed by customers in France, organisers said. The food will be flown to Bordeaux in a Diamond DA42 aircraft operated by Iroise Aro Formation, a flying school in France.The CTM is also proving a major export item from Britain to France. Retailer Marks & Spencer has been reportedly selling ready-to-eat CTM meals at its outlets in Paris by the thousands, making the dish its top selling meal there.CTM may have Indian origins butis reputed to have been invented in 1971 by a cook in Glasgow after a customer complained that his chicken dish was dry. The cook simply poured tomato soup into the dish with some spices, the customer loved it, and CTM was born."
5b208fd09855b768c2e029dc,Seed swap  a growing trend among green thumbs,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/seed-swap-a-growing-trend-among-green-thumbs/article24131936.ece,2018-06-11,,The Hindu,"Sharing food, or even ingredients, is common. Now, however, the growing number of people who share a passion for growing their own food also share an essential component of what they produce: the seeds.Right from virtual connection on social media to physically meeting, residents of the city are slowly but surely warming up to the idea of seed sharing.This exercise not only ensures higher germination rates and less dependence on commercial sellers, but also gives novices in the field a chance to learn first-hand from the experienced on how to go green and organic, they say.Good responseAfter organising its first Seed Swap in 2017, the Backyard Factory is back with another swapping event this month. The first seed swap event was well appreciated. We had posted information about the event on Facebook and a good number of people turned up for the event at Cubbon Park. The idea was to let people bring excess seeds from their produce and share them with people who are interested in growing their own food. It was a mutual exchange. What was surprising was most of the participants were young gardening enthusiasts, said Lincy Inder, who conducts kitchen gardening workshops for schoolchildren.This time, the event will be held on June 30 at Cubbon Park, and Ms. Inder expects even better participation than the last time.While meetings are very essential for seed sharing, another group also makes good use of social media to share seeds with the community. Members of Grow Your Own Food, a Facebook community, put up details of excess seeds available with them on social media. Others can contact the group if interested. The members meet once in two months for a seed swapping event at Lalbagh.Whatever we grow, we save the seeds for ourself and to share with others, said Suresh Rao, a member of the group.Mr. Rao said the best thing about seed sharing is that there is 100% guarantee of the seeds germinating. It is not the case with store-bought seeds. We usually share tomato, brinjal, gourd, and all types of greens during the meets, he said. The group also promotes heirloom seeds by sharing them.Explaining how the members store the excess seeds for sharing, he said, It is quite easy. From two tomatoes, 100 seeds can be obtained, which can be saved for the next season. One brinjal has around 200 seeds. Though the seed saving technique for each variety differs, it is not rocket science. During the meet-ups, we share the concepts with newcomers, Mr. Rao said.Another city-based group, Oota From Your Thota, which encourages people to grow their food organically, also organises seed swaps among members regularly.A common practiceWhile urban gardeners are just getting used to the idea of seed sharing, the practice is common among farmers, said Hemanth, farmer and member of the Facebook group Bangalore Gardening. In our farming community, seed sharing has always been a common practice. It helps reduce farmers dependence on commercially sold seeds and saves a lot of money, he says.The Horticulture Department too gives away seedlings instead of just seeds to anyone interested. After monsoon, we distribute the excess seedlings to interested people for free. Most are tree seedlings. In a year, at least 5,000 seedlings are given away, said M.R. Chandrashekar, Deputy Director, Lalbagh."

That separation is not a disease of colored people. It is a disease of white people. I do not intend to be quiet about it,"" he said during a commencement speech at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania.As a Jewish scientist who experienced anti-Semitism in Germany, Einstein showed deep sympathy for black people in America. He wandered around black neighborhoods in segregated Princeton, New Jersey, his home after leaving Germany amid the rise of the Nazis, sat on people's porches, chatted with them, and handed out candies to their children and grandchildren. He had become so entrenched in America's civil rights movement that the FBI placed him under surveillance, collecting nearly 1,500 pages of documents on Einstein by the time he died.But there's another side to Einstein that perhaps people did not know then.One of the travel diaries he wrote during a months-long voyage in the 1920s reveals that in his private moments, the Nobel-winning physicist portrayed people of other races, such as Chinese and Indians, in a stereotypical, dehumanizing way. Einstein's unfiltered musings about the people he saw and interacted with during his journey show that even the civil rights icon and ""paragon"" of humanitarianism harbored racist thoughts about those who did not look like him, said Ze'ev Rosenkranz, senior editor and assistant director of the Einstein Papers Project at the California Institute of Technology.""In published statements, he's usually in favor of civil and human rights and was socially progressive. I'm not saying that he didn't believe in those things,"" Rosenkranz said, but he added that the words Einstein never intended to be published are in stark contrast with his more-guarded public statements.That contradiction makes Einstein all the more human, said Rosenkranz, who edited ""The Travel Diaries of Albert Einstein,"" published recently by Princeton University Press.""I'm not apologizing for him or anything . . . I still feel that the unpleasant remarks are quite shocking, but they do reveal that we all have this darker side to our attitudes and prejudices,"" he said.Einstein wrote the travel diary from October 1922 to March 1923, when he and wife Elsa traveled by ship to the Mediterranean, Sri Lanka, China and Japan. He wrote every day about his surroundings, at times writing as if he was in a hurry. ""Radiant day. Sea quiet, almost windless,"" he wrote Oct. 12, 1922. Other times, he is more detailed: ""In the evening, wonderful sunset - purple with finely illuminated narrow wind-swept clouds,"" he wrote on the same day.He also chronicled his observations of people he saw and met, summing up ""their personalities and idiosyncrasies in just a few, often humorous or irreverent, words,"" Rosenkranz wrote in the introduction portion of the travel diary.The average Japanese, Einstein wrote, is ""unproblematic, impersonal, he cheerfully fulfills the social function which befalls him without pretension, but proud of his community and nation. Forsaking his traditional ways in favor of European ones does not undermine his national pride.""While Einstein used male pronouns for deeper reflections about the Japanese, his thoughts about women were more about their physical appearance than their personality. Japanese women, he wrote as he observed them on the ship, ""look ornate and bewildered . . . Black-eyed, black-haired, large-headed, scurrying.""His reflections about the Chinese, with whom he spent far less time, were more callous, even insulting. Though he called the Chinese ""industrious,"" he also described them as ""filthy"" and ""obtuse."" They're a ""peculiar herd-like nation,"" Einstein wrote, ""often more like automatons than people."" He saw them as intellectually inferior, quoting - instead of challenging - Portuguese teachers he met during his travels who claimed that the Chinese ""are incapable of being trained to think logically"" and ""have no talent for mathematics.""There was, as Rosenkranz described, a ""healthy dose of extreme misogyny"":""I noticed how little difference there is between men and women; I don't understand what kind of fatal attraction Chinese women possess which enthralls the corresponding men to such an extent that they are incapable of defending themselves against the formidable blessing of offspring.""His reflections in the few days he spent in China also reveal Einstein's tendency to perceive foreigners as a threat.""It would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all other races,"" he wrote. ""For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary.""In Colombo, Sri Lanka, he wrote with empathy about the beggars on the streets. He was ""very much ashamed"" for his complicity in such ""despicable treatment of human beings,"" he said. But he also was critical of them for being poor. He saw them as inferior people who ""live in great filth and considerable stench.""The Indians and Sinhalese in Colombo, Einstein said, ""do little"" and ""need little.""As he traveled in the Levant in the Mediterranean, he described Levantines as a ""screaming and gesticulating"" group of people ""of every shade."" Levantine merchants swarmed the ship, Einstein wrote, transforming the upper deck into a bazaar. He found them both repulsive and beautiful, describing them as ""bandit-like"" and ""filthy,"" but also ""handsome and graceful to look at.""About a decade after his travels, in December 1932, Einstein and his wife left Germany for a three-month trip to the United States. Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party took over the German government the following month. Einstein didn't return home and stayed in the United States, where he became more aware of the plight of African Americans. He entrenched himself in the civil rights movement, signed anti-lynching petitions and volunteered to testify as a character witness in the trial of writer and philosopher W.E.B. Du Bois.""It would be easy to say, yes, he became more enlightened,"" Rosenkranz said. But whether Einstein's racist views, particularly about the Chinese, had changed, Rosenkranz is not sure.All of this is to say that our understanding of Einstein misses his complexity as a human being, Rosenkranz said.""One should emphasize the different elements and contradictory elements in the statements that he made and in his personality,"" Rosenkranz said. ""On one hand, he was very generous and very favorable . . . But there's also these statements that one should not ignore."" What this says about human nature is that we are complex beings with both enlightened and dark beliefs, Rosenkranz said. ""We generally don't express them, but we might harbor them secretly. This gives us the opportunity to look at ourselves."""
5b223f849855b7429b3172cf,"Beef, Fried Rice, Potatoes: The Diplomatic Meaning Of The Trump-Kim Lunch",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/beef-fried-rice-potatoes-the-diplomatic-meaning-of-the-trump-kim-lunch-1867213,2018-06-14,,NDTV,"Images of the lunch shows pre-plated starters on a rectangular table lined down the center. (File)The summit lunch, which brought together 13 principals from both delegations was ""a little unexpected,"" given the early stage of the talks between the two world leaders. (Reuters)The lunch menu for the historic summit involving President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the opulent Capella resort in Singapore suggests both sides got what they wanted from Tuesday's sit-down: concessions, in the form of dishes designed to appeal to both a meat-loving American and a North Korean with more international tastes.The menu should have come with pencils for circling choices. Beneath each course were three oh-so-diplomatic options. Starters featured a prawn cocktail served with avocado salad , a steakhouse staple POTUS would probably be reassured to see; Korean stuffed cucumbers; and green mango kerabu with honey-lime dressing and fresh octopus. Kerabu, a staple of Malay cuisine, is a refreshing salad judged by the balance of sweet, sour, salty and hot notes in the dressing.BBC News reported that the stuffed cucumbers, or oiseon, caused some raised eyebrows among Koreans, given the dish's royal origins. ""It's a bit like the British prime minister sitting down to dine with a visiting dignitary and chowing down on a roasted swan - a favourite of Henry VIII,"" the news outlet declared.Wherever Trump and Asian leaders meet, beef is sure to be in the picture. Over a round of golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last November, hamburgers were served. On a trip to China last year, Trump's hosts seemed to be appealing to his affection for steak with ketchup when he was offered ""stewed beef steak in tomato sauce.""Sure enough, beef, as in short rib confit, was one of three main course selections. The entree was rounded out with steamed broccolini (doctor's orders, maybe, since Trump is said to be dieting?) and potato dauphinois, a fancier way to say potatoes au gratin, a Trump favorite. Both leaders can get around spuds. Kim, who as a teenager studied abroad in Switzerland, is said to have developed a fondness for rosti, the country's famous potato pancakes.In deference to Trump, a teetotaler, the beef's red wine sauce was listed as ""on the side."" (Kim, who has retained both Japanese sushi and Italian pizza makers, reportedly has a fondness for fine French wines.)The alternate entrees were soy-braised cod with Asian vegetables and sweet-and-sour pork with Yangzhou fried rice flavored with XO chile sauce. Was the fried rice a sly way to find a spot for China, North Korea's largest trading partner, at the table? Kim arrived in the city/state aboard a Boeing 747 operated by Air China. Multiple news sources said he brought along some of his own food and even a toilet.Dessert - the course with the power to leave a last impression - was decidedly Western. Choices included a dark chocolate tartlet; the cream- or custard-filled brioche called Tropezienne; and vanilla ice cream with cherry coulis. The scoops came from Haagen-Dazs, the only designer label flagged on the menu. Presumably, Trump didn't get his preferred double helping of ice cream.Video of guests gathering for the lunch shows pre-plated starters on a rectangular table lined down the center with soothing green- and cream-colored flowers. While Singapore was the facilitating host, Trump appeared to take command, asking photographers: ""Getting a good picture everybody? So we look nice and handsome and thin? Perfect.""Getting to ""perfect,"" or close to it, involves teams from both sides identifying the preferences and steering clear of the dislikes of the principals, says Peter Selfridge, who served as U.S. chief of protocol during the last three years of the Obama administration. Reached for comment, the former ambassador said via email, ""At first glance, it looks like rather than having to decide on one main dish that would appease both [palates] - a difficult task under normal conditions - they chose to offer something for everyone, while also giving a nod to the flavors of the host country."" Selfridge called the summit lunch, which brought together 13 principals from both delegations, ""a little unexpected,"" given the early stage of the talks between the two world leaders. Then again, he said, ""sharing a meal goes a long way to breaking the ice."""

This led to tension at some places.The protesting farmers continued to dump agricultural produce and milk in vegetable markets and on roads to show their protest, while in some villages and towns, they set up temporary stalls to sell the vegetables at throwaway prices.Vegetable prices soarIts impact at vegetable markets was visible as prices surged in absence of adequate supply.In the past couple of days, prices of some veggies  especially green vegetables  have gone up.

However, it lost steam after few days as the bid of farmer organisations to block transport of milk and other essential items to cities was thwarted by police.Bharatiya Kisan Union Madhya Pradesh general secretary Anil Yadav admitted the impact of the strike was not as expected in MP, and blamed the fear of the police for its failure. The farmers do not want to get into the wrong books of police. Thousands have been forced to sign bonds of ?25,000 and BJP workers among the farmers and members of the RSS-backed Bharatiya Kisan Sangh were active in sabotaging the strike, he said.Yadav said to make the bandh a total success there will be a Bharat Bandh on June 10 in which there will be no movement of any goods from villages to towns. Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh president Shiv Kumar Sharma said they will work to make the June 10 bandh a success. We have given call for a Bharat Bandh and asked all those living in 6 lakh villages of the country not to supply anything in the towns. We have also requested traders to keep their shops closed till 2pm in our support, he said.Sharma said the biggest achievement of the strike was that despite provocation from the administration, the movement was peaceful. They threatened farmers, made them sign bonds, and were looking for an excuse to give this movement a bad name, but failed, he said, adding the impact was not as successful as expected.In a bid to support the call, the Congress in Gujarat announced its support for ongoing farmer protest seeking farm loan waiver, saying the Vijay Rupani government was in its three-day annual chintan shivir (brainstorming session) in Vadodara, and was not thinking about farm distress. The BJP government holds agricultural festival every year but, in reality, it has not addressed the real issues concerning farmers. Be it the right prices or expansion of irrigation network, the government has failed on all fronts, said Leader of Opposition Paresh Dhanani.On the first day of the Congress-backed agitation, farmers threw vegetables and spilled milk on roads, mostly in Saurashtra, central and north Gujarat. In Keshod town of Junagadh district, the party observed a day-long bandh. On last day (Sunday) of the drive, there will be dharnas and hunger strike, Dhanani added.In UPs Amroha, farmers threw tomatoes on road as part of the agitation and announced that they will not allow movement of any goods on June 10."

Police reached the spot and the milkmen had to take another route to reach the city. The two groups entered into a scuffle.Similar scenes were witnessed at Rampura Phul and on the Bathinda- Muktsar road where milkmen resorted to protest by raising slogans against them being stopped from selling their produce.Activists of the BKU (Ekta Sidhupur) had set up nakas at Jodhpur Romana near Bibiwala village on the Bathinda-Talwandi Sabo road, the Bathinda  Goniana road and on the Bathinda-Malout road.Sohan Singh, the state president of the Milkmen Union, said that they had told the farmer unions before the start of the strike that any milkmen who want to support them are free do so by not supplying milk to the city areas but no milkman should be forced to stop the supply.He said that it is not possible for the majority of the milkmen not to supply milk for 10 days.In Sangrur district also, farmers set up check-points at different places and stopped vegetable growers and dairy owners from carrying their produce to the city areas on Saturday night and on Sunday morning. Dairy owners dumped milk on the roads at Bhawanigarh, alleging that farmer unions were harassing them and milkmen. They said the activists should instead hold protests outside big milk plants.The BKU leadership, however, claimed that milkman unions are supporting their agitation. Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of a faction of BKU, said he was working to make this protest peaceful. We are getting expected response, he said.At Phagwara, a group of farmers laid siege outside the local vegetable market and did not allow trucks or tractor-trolleys carry farm produce to enter inside.A group of farmers created ruckus at the new vegetable market by forcing commission agents to shut their shops and not allowing them to sell their stock of vegetables and fruits. Police force was deployed to avoid any untoward incident.Veggie prices continue to soarPrices of various vegetables have doubled or trebled since the strike started two days back.Varinder Kumar, a vegetable seller in Jalandhar, said they are somehow managing to get vegetables from farmers or from the old stocks at mandis at double or triple rates.Tomato, which was being sold at 10 per kg three days ago, is now 30 per kg while prices of peas, brinjal, cabbage, cauliflower and other vegetables have also gone up.Not much effect in MajhaIn Majha belt, the plan to suspend the supplies of vegetables and milk failed to elicit much response as essential commodities were available in the market as usual.The Kisan Sangarsh Committee has refused to support the protest.Its Punjab convener, Kawalpreet Singh Pannu, said they will not support the protest that affects the common man."

Traditional farming got me Rs 50,000 an acre a year. That works out to be Rs 25-Rs 30 lakh a year, he says as he shows around his six-acre net house farm.Crops are sown in a controlled environment in a net house. Its a farm technique pioneered by Israel and has worked wonders. Satpal says growing cucumber, capsicum and tomato in his six-acre net house fetches him Rs 48-Rs 50 lakh a year.

They taught them how to provide seedlings in a soil-less medium in a green house; the use of drip irrigation; nutrient management; the use of thermal nets; pollination of vegetables inside poly houses; branching and wiring of plants.

It will cost me Rs 12 lakh as Ill get Rs 8 lakh as subsidy under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, he says. His elder son, a BTech degree holder, is studying mushroom production to run the project. My second son is studying law. I couldnt have paid for their education had I not made the switch, Satpal adds.Horticulture hubTaking a cue from his friend who grew strawberries, Arun Chauhan, 50, quit his engineering job in 1998 to return to Manouli village and start farming. For years, his family grew wheat and paddy on 30 acres, earning Rs 30,000-Rs 40,000 per acre.Chauhan wanted to do something different. He saw residents of neighbouring Aterna village grow baby corn. A private company guiding farmers there suggested he grow sweet corn. He started with a small chunk. After two years, our produce surpassed expectations, he says. This inspired others. Today my village is called the sweet corn village as every second farmer here grows it. The cost of sowing sweet corn is Rs 20,000 per acre but the returns are from Rs 1 lakh-Rs 2 lakh per acre, he says.Chauhan learned poly house farming from the CoE at Gharaunda in 2008. He set up a poly house on an acre and has now increased it to six acres. The money I get from six acres is four times higher than what I get from the 24 acres I own. I started growing lilies in the poly house and have since shifted to cherry tomatoes and seedless cucumbers. For two years, Im growing red, yellow and green bell peppers, he adds.Chauhan says a poly house set up in an acre gives him 250-300 quintals of bell peppers, which sells for Rs 10-15 lakh. The best is I dont have to go anywhere. Brands such as Dominos and Reliance Fresh come to my village and collect the vegetables, he says. Ive started growing muskmelon after CoE experts suggested a high-yield method. To maintain the poly house, the CoE has suggested we do soil solarisation by mulching and fumigation, he adds.Purchasing powerManchuri resident Surjit Singh is among those who has benefited from the CoE for vegetables. He says net house farming increased his per acre earning from Rs 6 lakh to Rs 8 lakh.I started net house farming on two acres in 2013. Gradually, I increased it to six acres, Singh said. He started growing cucumber, tomato and capsicum and says he has never faced losses despite fluctuating prices.For Surjit and his elder brother, Inderjit, who own 35 acres, life has changed in five years. Their purchasing power has increased and they no longer worry about crop loss and rising input costs. Income from six acres of net house farming is more than the 29 acres under traditional crops, he says. Many farmers have drawn inspiration from our experience and seek our help, he adds.Sandeep Kumar, 36, of Mohindipur in Karnal has also seen his income increase in two years ever since he adopted net-house farming.Sandeep, who shifted from Delhi to Karnal after his land was acquired by the government, says, Initially, I entered into the real estate business but it turned non-profitable in 2014 and I turned to growing vegetables. He started net-house farming on an acre to grow cucumber and capsicum. I earned Rs 6 lakh-Rs 7 lakh from an acre and have since increased the area under net-house farming to three acres, he adds.(Hitender Rao, Hardik Anand and Neeraj Mohan)"

Earlier, his Madhya Pradesh counterpart claimed no farmers are participating in the strike. Farmers are happy with the schemes.Farmer organisations called for a 10-day Gaon Bandh (rural shutdown) from June 1 demanding loan waivers, land reforms and higher prices for their produce. The agitation, which the organisers say will end with a nationwide shutdown on its tenth day, has brought back focus on an agrarian crisis that could, unless addressed, hurt the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) politically in elections to key states later this year and the national elections in 2019.Traders in the Chandigarh fruit and vegetable market said the prices of several vegetables such as tomatoes, potatoes, capsicum and bottle gourd had increased by Rs 10-20 a kilo.Traders in some markets in Madhya Pradesh also reported a spike in prices. There is a 30-40% drop in supplies since yesterday. Today, the wholesale prices were up by about 20%, said Amit Patidar, a trader at Neemuch fruit and vegetable market.At a few places in Madhya Pradesh, farmers put up blockades. In Petlawad town in tribal Jhabua district, farmers distributed milk and vegetables free to patients in the hospitals , refusing to sell both.Resentment among farmers is particularly strong in Madhya Pradesh  a BJP-ruled state that is among a clutch of others set for elections this winter  and Congress president Rahul Gandhi is expected to visit Mandsaur in the state, where five farmers were killed last year on June 6, while taking part in demonstrations.Anil Yadav, the union general secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union, one of the organisations coordinating the agitation, said the campaign will be amplified from next week.In Punjab, where chief minister Amarinder Singh blamed the Centre for the farm crisis, farmers protested at several places such as Nabha, Ludhiana, Muktsar, Tarn Taran, Nangal and Ferozepur and blocked supply of vegetables and milk entering cities.According to the Punjab police, farmers allegedly forced the closure of vegetable mandi in Ferozpur and in Bathinda, farmers owing allegiance to Bhartiya Kisan Union stopped some vehicles carrying milk. Some farmers were taken into custody, said Bathinda police station officer Iqbal Singh.In Haryana, milk supply to Haryana Dairy Development Co-operative Federation Ltd was blocked in several districts. In Sirsa, police booked about 90 unidentified persons for allegedly trying to stop sale of milk and vegetables in their village. In Hisar, Fatehabad and Sirsa where the farmers held protest early morning and did not allow any vegetable seller to reach at the city.In Maharashtra, the Rashtriya Kisaan Mahasangh (RKM) stopped supplies of vegetables, fruits and mils to cities such as Mumbai, Pune and Nashik. The Mahasangh also announced it would intensify the agitation by increasing the number of traffic blockades from June 7.The decision to stop supplies starting from June 1 till June 10 was taken by the farmers under the banner of Kisan Ekta Manch and Rashtriya Kisan Maha Sangh.(With agency inputs)"

Minor incidents of scuffle between farmers and traders were also reported from Bikaner and Sriganganagar.Cooperative dairies were reluctant to procure milk because of the ongoing protest. Jaipur Dairy chairman Om Prakash Punia has written to chief secretary DB Gupta, requesting him to ensure adequate security for milk tankers.On Saturday, farmers spilled milk on roads in Jaipur rural areas.

You can have them scrambled, boiled, curried, poached, baked, basted, fried sunny side up and even whisked raw in coffee. Additionally, they play the role of binder, thickener, emulsifier and vitalizer. Want to give definition and bounce to your hair? Simply slap an egg on your scalp!As a protein source, eggs are a delight for both weight-watchers and those building muscle. But none desires eggs more than the hungry soul who is either low on budget or shorn of a wholesome eating option late at night.Shabbir Shaikh comes to the rescue here. The 39-year-old has been running a handcart selling egg dishes outside the Shivajinagar railway station for the past 20 years. He conducts business till 3am, moving his cart into a nondescript lane adjoining the station after midnight.On an average, Shaikh uses 300 eggs daily but sticks to just three dishes  bhurji, omelette and half fry (renamed palti if flipped over). Each dish, which comes with four pavs, is priced at Rs 50 till midnight and Rs 60 thereafter. Interestingly, Shaikh says rail and bus passengers are not his chief clientele  word of mouth about his food draws in regular customers from as far as Pimpri and Hinjewadi.Like Shaikh, most stalls and handcarts in the city restrict their egg menu to not more than four or five dishes. Yash Pawar, owner of Pune Egg Cafe on Senapati Bapat Road, says this is very unlike Gujarat, especially Surat and Vadodara, where stalls have around 25-30 different egg dishes on their list.The 24-year-old Pawar, who grew up in Vadodara and came here to study at Symbiosis, has more than 50 egg items on his menu, with the average pricing being Rs 100. He says his chef, who is from Vadodara, can rustle up 300 types of egg dishes. Pawar offers eggs in rice, gravies and parathas, and as starters or omelettes. His trademark dishes are the ghotala (of Surat fame), boiled egg tikka masala and egg-kheema rice. And, yes, the place satisfies late-night food cravings.Pawar says he uses only Amul butter for his dishes. So does Dnyaneshwar Narvankar, the franchise owner of the newly-started eggs-only Raju Omlet at Vimannagar. Now, the Omlet is no typo; it has been retained in the name boards of all 12 outlets of the brand  six of them in Gujarat and one each in Mumbai, Pune, Dubai, Sharjah, Pattaya and the US.All outlets have a fixed menu of 13 dishes, and each dish uses 50 gms of butter. The dishes are priced up to Rs 170, and the best-sellers are the green boiled egg tikka and the crush omelette. Narvankar says the outlets do not believe in experimenting with too many dishes, though he points out that one can find more than 1,000 egg recipes across Gujarat. The Vadodara outlet, from where the business started, uses a whopping 1,500 eggs a day.At Sangvi, Shriram Pawar operates a food truck which offers 111 egg dishes from evening to midnight. The 34-year-old, who spent a year in a similar business in Surat, claims to be the only one in Maharashtra to offer the intriguingly-named egg pomfret. Well, this dish is basically an omelette fried adequately to earn a texture like the skin of a fish. The omelette is then folded and shaped like a pomfret. It is stuffed with chopped cooked egg whites and cheese before being dunked into a plateful of tomato-based gravy.Pawar, who uses around 200 eggs per day, says each of his myriad dishes has a unique taste. An exhaustive menu like his would be found in many places in Gujarat, he points out. There, eggs have an acceptability factor among the largely vegetarian population, even though they may not be eaten at home."

About 28 traders did not participate in the first phase of the process that took place on Tuesday.Acknowledging that the reception among existing traders to relocate their business to the Kallikudi integrated market complex was overwhelming, officials said that around 272 wholesale traders would be moved to the ground floor of the new 9.79 acre facility. Subsequently, in the second phase, the department in coordination with the district administration eyes to relocate another 100 traders from the Gandhi market.We have initiated the process to allot shop numbers and respective blocks to the traders whose applications were selected based on suggestions and inspections by the scrutiny committee that includes city corporation. The response to relocate was good particularly among the English and country vegetables traders, an official with the agriculture marketing department told TOI.The allotment process saw the 272 traders allocated with a shop each across selective blocks of the total 19 blocks in the integrated market. Subsequently, the traders provided with shops through randomisation will be asked to make an agreement with the marketing department to rent the shops for one year tenure.The registration process for identified traders allotted with shops will conclude by June 15 (Friday). Simultaneously, we will take measures to hand over keys to the respective traders, the official added. The stakeholders have asserted that full-fledged relocation of 300 wholesale traders from Gandhi market to integrated market would be initiated after June 15. When the district administration insists us to relocate the shops we have no other go.

The current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops.Sugarcane farmers in Uttar Pradesh are owed over Rs 8,300 crore for the crop they have supplied to mills this crushing season at the state governments advised price (SAP). Maharashtras cane growers had similar unpaid dues of Rs 2,213 crore as on March 31, that too, against the Centres lower mandated fair and remunerative price (FRP). Yet, cane area in Maharashtra for the coming 2018-19 season from October is nearly 19 per cent up, while there are reports of UP farmers, too, planting more, undeterred by mounting payment arrears. One reason for this could be sugarcanes hardiness and ability to withstand hail, frost, fire, water, nilgai and wild boar, making it practically a default crop in areas where there is assured irrigation. The fact that its green top leaves can meet the fodder requirements of animals during the crushing period from October to April further adds to the attractiveness.But the current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops. We are, indeed, witnessing a disturbing trend now of farmers going back to planting not just cane, but also paddy and wheat. These are safe crops, where there is reasonable guarantee of receiving minimum support price (MSP) through government procurement. Sugarcane farmers, likewise, know that mills will eventually be forced to pay the FRP/SAP, though the monies may come with a few months delay. Theres no such certainty of return or even yields vis--vis other crops. Bt cotton has lost its bite, with the existing hybrids becoming increasingly susceptible to white-fly and pink bollworm attacks. Oilseeds and pulses have been trading below MSPs over the last 2-3 harvesting seasons. Farmers arent making money even in vegetable cultivation: Tomatoes in Kolar (Karnataka), onions in Lasalgaon (Maharashtra) and potatoes in Agra (UP) are currently selling or were just sold at Rs 6-7 per kg.Given these realities, it is not difficult to see why farmers are seeking a flight to safety  from chana to wheat in Madhya Pradesh, tur, soyabean and ginger to sugarcane in Marathwada, cotton and maize to paddy in Punjab. This is more akin to distress migration rather than a response to any profit signals. The policy prescription to address it is simple: The Centre and state governments should desist from hiking MSPs/FRPs/SAPs of paddy, wheat and sugarcane, which will further incentivise the cultivation of these relatively water-intensive crops. Instead, farmers should be ensured of getting MSPs and reasonable returns at least in oilseeds, pulses, tomatoes, onions and potatoes, whether through physical procurement or price deficiency payment transfers directly into their bank accounts.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

I start cooking after 10 a.m with the assistance of two persons. The gruel requires constant stirring to achieve proper consistency and we have to serve it hot. I stay back at the mosque till kanji is served, he said.Abdul Razack, 70, who leads the prayers in the mosque every day, says that it is ideal diet for people during fasting. It is cooked in a manner that it is easy to digest, he adds.The family of 56-year-old Mohammed Nasar, president of the Pallivasal, has been doing this service for 11 generations. It was his great grandfather Nanu Sahib who built this mosque in 1928. We have taken up this service for generations. During Ramzan month, people who pray at the mosque donate towards the preparation of kanji. The names of all the 30 donors are displayed in the mosque. They donate a minimum of Rs. 10,000 per day to buy 50 kg rice, vegetables and other ingredients required to prepare the kanjiHe added that tokens are issued to 300 people.

We have an archival recipe record of nearly 400-500 dishes, which we have served in our restaurant in the last 75 years, says Akash K Kalra, Managing Director, The United Group. Of these, around 150-200 dishes are on the menu all the time. We keep going back to these, bringing it back to our customers, adapting it to suit their palate and new trends, adds Kalra.Despite this emphasis on food, when United Coffee House started, food was not its focal point. It was more of a place to meet and chat  an adda of sorts. As Kalra says, For many, this was a place to walk in on Sundays after listening to the military nand play and watching the fountains at Central Park for a cup of coffee with snacks.Making the right brewEstablished in 1942, it was the brain child of Lala Hans Raj Kalra (Akash Kalras grandfather), the son of a liquor baron who had a flourishing liquor business in Sialkot in Pakistan. The family moved to Delhi and were based in Chandni Chowk.The first foray into hospitality came with the setting up of the Esplanade Restaurant & Bar in 1938-39 to cater to the American GIs who had their barracks at the Red Fort. It proved to be very popular, but since it was meant for the GIs, it wound up with their moving out after the War in the early 40s.Around that time, Hans Raj Kalra heard of an affluent shopping arcade in Lutyens Delhi called Connaught Place, which had been built in the shape of a horse shoe, for luck. What it lacked was a coffee house. He bought the place and opened United Coffee House.In the 40s, the place would be open from 11 am to 8 pm, typically selling street snacks of Old Delhi. Kalra says, Food then was commercial. No one would eat home food outside, so it was only omelette, chana bhatura, tikka...Post-Independence, the hours extended, and by the 60s it became a full-fledged restaurant. The cuisine initially was a mix of the Old Delhi Kayasth food and Frontier Province Pakistani food.The menu expanded, and during their lifetime, the place had served everything from commercial food, bibiyana (homemade) food, Madras club food, Bombay club food, Calcutta club food, Anglo Indian, khansama-cooked memsahib cuisine, to continental food, Asian, Mexican, Lebanese and, of course, Indian.Conceived in the British era, it still holds a fondness for the Old Raj cuisine, especially British club food  cheese balls, cutlets, samosas, chops.On the menuKalra says, We are known for our keema samosa, cheese balls, tomato fish and chicken a la Kiev. These have not been invented by us, but our variation is a huge hit. There are plenty of other staples  chapli kebabs, Railway mutton curry, dak bungalow chicken curry, chicken Maryland, coq au vin, chicken a la princess.Kalra explains, My grandfather had the acumen to get some of the finest cooks of those times to work for us. With their feedback and my grandfathers insight, a dish would be perfected after many trials. For example, a chef from Lucknow might add raw mango and bay leaf to a dak bungalow chicken curry, which made the taste entirely different from the usual one.To commemorate the 75th year, a new menu was unveiled in May. Classic dishes which had not been on the menu for 20-30 years were revamped.Kalra enthusiastically says, Fuyong, chow chows from Asia, buttermilk burgers were on the list. These dishes are being adjusted to suit todays palate. So if a baked salmon was served with boiled vegetables, today we would be doing it with braised bok choi.What works for UCH is that it still retains the old-world charm of the 1950s  the laid-back era of fine dining, huge chandeliers, unhurried knowledgeable waiters, the attention and care to the patrons with a sense of discreet familiarity."

The states where the farmers have started the stir include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, and those in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and other states may join them. The plan also includes a nationwide bandh on June 10. Farmers have resorted to protest actions like stopping the supply of produce to the mandis and it has started impacting the prices of vegetables, fruits and milk in cities and towns. The agitation is being organised by as many as 104 farmers bodies, led by the Rashtriya Kisan Sangh. It is unfortunate that farmers have to be in a perpetual mode of agitation, and it shows that their problems continue to remain unsolved. Farmers in Maharashtra made a long march to Mumbai in March. The Maharashtra government accepted their demands but the promises are yet to be implemented.The farmers have made a number of demands, including remunerative prices for their produce and waiver of farm loans. The agitation is mainly against the central government. The Narendra Modi government had promised to raise the minimum support prices to 150% of the cost of production, as recommended by the Swaminathan Committee, but it has not done that. It had promised to double farmers income by 2022, but most farmers are poorer now than they there a few years ago. Indebted farmers continue to commit suicide. The present plight in many places is not because of the failure of crops resulting from drought or other reasons but because of higher production and the consequent fall in prices. For example, the production of potatoes, tomatoes and garlic has increased but this has led to their prices falling below cost. Marketing of produce is a major problem because of the existence of intermediaries, and the farmer never gets the right price. Official policies often work against the interests of farmers. The government has decided to import sugar and tur dal when there is a glut of these in the country.The lack of facilities for preservation of perishable produce like fruits and vegetables and the absence of an efficient and transparent marketing mechanism are major problems. There is no system to give guidance to farmers on the crops to be cultivated on the basis of projections of demand and supply. Uncertainties caused by weather and government policies continue and the farm insurance system is very inadequate. The spreading agitation is another wake-up call and warning to the government. Effective policies and actions, and not promises and slogans, are needed to mitigate the rising distress."

Along the 856km border between them, much of which is fenced, Indian families live outside the barrier, connected with gates manned by the BSF.On Sunday, when Assembly elections will be held in Tripura, these residents will come out of their caged existence to vote. At Jainagar here, 39 Muslim families had their homes on the wrong side when the fence came up nearly 12 years ago. Since then, their movements are restricted by the clock - the gates open at 6am and close at 8.30pm.Along the border, these gates are numbered. At Gate 86, young Sofikul seeks the BSF sentry's permission to come out with his bicycle and head to school. He needs to make a written entry and produce his identity card and a yellow gate pass issued by the BSF.Hasina Khatun, 55, needs to go back home inside the fence, so her name is marked on the register at the gate.She had accompanied her 32-year-old son, Bashir Mia to hospital to treat a deep cut on his palm. Hasina rues having to adhere to gate deadlines; it impinges on her freedom of movement especially when there are family celebrations in town. ""If we are late in returning, we have to spend the night with relatives outside. We appreciate the security, especially with our paddy fields and tomato patches safe from intruders. But it is like living in a cage. On voting day, we will have to leave home early,"" she says.""There is no mosque inside, so we need to come out even for prayers,"" adds Bashir.The opening and closing of these gates is strictly regulated. The BSF sentries deposit the keys at the camp and the procedure to reopen the gates in an emergency involves securing permission from the authorities, the BSF company commander at Konaban in Sipahijala district, Pawan Yadav explains.Having travelled 60km along the fencing, with a lone sentry at each gate, one reaches the Kamalasagar company headquarters of the force. The security on this smuggling-prone stretch is double-layered: area domination patrols by day and ambush-cum-patrol teams at night. At Radhanagar, Abul Kasam Mia, Joydeep Debnath and Dhirendra Debnath stand at the CPM rally kiosk. The sitting MLA looks set to retain his seat here.On reaching Belabor (Gate 92), we find villagers Abdul Majid and Sajal Mia emerging from the gates. Theirs is a piquant situation: their homes are on the Indian side of the gate, but the farmland lies on the other side, so they make multiple entries during the day. At Gate 98 at Motinagar, 400 people live inside the fence. On Sunday, these voters will troop out and head for the nearest booth.

(Image used for representational purpose)A little over a month since the Union Budget declared a special Operation Green for tomato, onion and potato growers, prices of at least the first two produces seem to be touching an all-time low in the state. With wholesale prices of both the commodities going down to single digits, most farmers are staring at major agrarian distress. In Maharashtra, the wholesale markets of Junnar in Pune and Pimpalgaon in Nashik are major hubs of tomato trade.On Friday, the Pimpalgaons market had recorded the arrival of 695 crates of tomatoes, and the average traded price per crate was Rs 61. With a crate containing 20 kg of tomato, the average price per kg works out to be Rs 3 at the wholesale markets. Similarly, at the Narayangaon wholesale market, 6,330 crates of the produce had arrived, and the average traded price of a crate was Rs 60, which also translates to Rs 3 per kg. Junnar is normally the hub of summer tomatoes, while Pimpalgaon mostly gets the the winter crop.Onions, which till recently, were trading above the Rs 20 per kg mark, has also started trading below the Rs 10 per kg at most wholesale markets. At Lasalgaons wholesale market in Nashiks Niphad taluka, the average traded price of onion was Rs 7.54 per kg, with the market recording the arrival of 15,140 quintals of the bulb. Just about a month ago, onions were trading at Rs 15.50 per kg at this market, a steady fall of over 50 per cent.Maharashtra has seen a 10-15 per cent rise in area under cultivation for both onions and tomatoes. Shriram Ghadhave, president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India (VGAI), attributed this growth to the good rainfall received in the state last year. As against the 2.5 lakh hectares of tomato area, this year, we have about 3 lakh hectares under the crop. Even places like Beed, Aurangabad and Parbhani, which normally do not see cultivation of summer tomatoes, have planted the crop, he said.A similar situation has resulted in the steep price fall in case of onions also. Ghadhave added that inter-state trade has almost stopped with traders from north India absent from the market.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

A la carte. Im talking about the 40s, 50s and 60s, when Bombays food culture was blooming.This is before anyone could conceive that surnames like Lokhandwala and Hiranandani would mutate into names of suburbs. It was a time when restaurants along the Churchgate strip, hotels like The Taj Mahal and virtuosos like Chef Masci (Miguel Arcanjo Mascarenhas) were introducing the Bombay elite to words like Velout, Bchamel, Au Gratin and Flamb. The city was warming up to what was generically called Continental food.Lets stop there for a moment and examine that term. The Continent is Europe and the influence is from France and Italy and maybe the odd dish from Hungary and Russia. The cuisines of these countries slowly swaying the humdrum, morose tastes of Great British Cooking. And that food making its way to our metropolitan aspirations.Me with my lobster thermidor. This marriage of creamy seafood/ meat, egg and wine are hallmarks of the cuisine that ruled Bombay menus from the 40s through the 60s.Now cooks and butlers in Calcutta, Madras and Bombays posh clubs, and households too, were turning into desi Escoffiers, all expertly mastering Continental dishes. Innovative and complicated recipes like Chicken a la Kiev (a little hand-grenade sized ball of crumb fried hollow chicken served with buttered beans, carrots and mashed potato), or Chicken and Ham Timbale (minced chicken and ham, steam-baked in cups and served with mushroom sauce) or Welsh Rarebit (which is nothing but a sauce of melted cheese with red chilli, poured over slices of toasted bread) or Ramekins of Eggs (eggs baked in cheese sauce) or a Shepherds Pie (mince baked with mashed potatoes) became commonplace in the not-so-commonplace eateries.For the next 35 years or so, this cuisine reigned supreme at every banquet, buffet and blowout. No party or dinner was complete without dishes like Eggs Florentine, Vegetable Au Gratin, Poulet  la Crme et Champignons (chicken with cream and mushrooms) or Steak Chateaubriand (thick tenderloin in a shallot and red-wine reduction with chateau potatoes), always served for two.But just when you think youve learned the way to live, life changes. The 21st century brought along with it liquid nitrogen, lecithin and foams and nearly wiped out words like Espagnole, Hollandaise and Roux. Continental food got sidelined. Now considered an unhealthy, butter- and flour-laden cuisine, the world woke up to Paul Bocuse, Pierre Gagnaire, Heston Blumenthal and MasterChef on television.Just a few restaurants in Bombay still keep the richness and simplicity of Continental cuisine alive, like The Society at Ambassador Hotel with their Chicken Diane, among other dishes.Distance brings nostalgia, and with nostalgia comes perspective, and maybe objectivity. Just a few restaurants still keep the richness and simplicity of that cuisine alive. I head to Gallops at the race course for a Chicken Cecelia (sauted in butter and topped with cheese, mushroom and asparagus), and to The Society at Ambassador Hotel, which is still famous for their Roast Duck in Orange Sauce, Coq au Vin  and for that fact that the server comes to the table to flamb you a Chicken Diane or Spaghetti a la Fernandes.But my discovery of the year has been the nostalgic menu at Fenix at The Oberoi. Executive chef Satbir Bakshi has turned this modern, unassuming caf into one of the finest gourmet destinations in the city. I went there to celebrate my birthday with friends, and we started with classic Lobster Bisque. This is a wholesome crustacean soup (in this case, crayfish) thick, creamy and well-seasoned, with a base of tomato. If youre not careful, the soup could get too fishy, but this was just perfectly flavoured. Along with the bisque we ordered some good old-fashioned Prawn Cocktail. Thats cooked prawns in a cocktail sauce (essentially ketchup plus mayonnaise with a few shakes of Tabasco). At Fenix, Chef Satbir garnishes the Prawn Cocktail with thin slices of boiled egg and tops it all with caviar.At Fenix at The Oberoi, executive chef Satbir Bakshi garnishes the Prawn Cocktail with thin slices of boiled egg and tops it all with caviar.For the main course we shared Fish  la Meunire. A Meunire sauce, made from butter, lemon, and parsley, served with crispy sauted fish.But all eyes were on the Lobster Thermidor. Its a dish that has fascinated me since I was a child. So much so that I learnt to cook it when I was very young. Legend and Wiki say that the great French chef Auguste Escoffier created this dish in a Parisian restaurant called Maison Maire, near the Thtre de la Porte-Saint-Martin. The dish was named after a play, Thermidor by Victorien Sardou, which opened in that theatre to packed houses. Its whole lobster shell, stuffed with a creamy mixture of cooked lobster meat, egg yolk and cognac or white wine, gratinated with Gruyre and baked till brown. Its luxury from another day, and Fenix does it impeccably."

(Illustration: C R Sasikumar, Sarfaraz Alam) As two of the seven years have already passed and given the performance of agriculture in 2016-17 and 2017-18, the required CAGR in the remaining five years will have to be much higher than these rates. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar, Sarfaraz Alam)Prime Minister Narendra Modi is one of the best orators in Indian politics today. He is not only coherent and inspiring but connects with his audience well. He is ambitious and committed to fast-track the economy. He sets high targets and drives government machinery to achieve them. In the process, he raises aspirations and expectations of people which if not met, run the risk of hurting his own and the governments credibility.Unrealistic promises that remain unfulfilled could hurt the PMs political capital. People could doubt his intent, his understanding of involved challenges, or the capability of his government to deliver. The case in point is his often-repeated ambition of doubling farmers real incomes by 2022. By all means, we want to see him succeed in his ambition. However, our analysis and professional acumen informs us otherwise. We believe that farmers real incomes cannot be doubled even by 2025. The target of achieving it by 2030 seems more plausible. In saying so, we run the risk of being unpopular but as Gandhiji once said, Its easy to stand with the crowd. It takes courage to stand alone. And so, we gather courage to say that the ambition of doubling farmers income by 2022 is a pipe-dream and not a serious target.PM Modi spoke of his dream of doubling farmers income by 2022 for the first time in February 2016. This was repeated in successive budget speeches of the finance minister. In Ap06ril 2016, the Dalwai Committee was formed; it came out with a 14-volume report to identify ways to double farmers income from the 2015-2016 levels, in real terms, in seven years. Since there was no updated estimate of actual level of farmers incomes in 2015-16, the Committee arrived at estimates by applying net state domestic product (NSDP) growth rates on estimated state-wise farmers incomes of 2012-13 (from the NSSO). It found that an average Indian farmer household earned Rs 96,703 in 2015-16 (this was Rs 77,977 in 2012-13 according to the NSSO). Doubling this to Rs1,93,406 (at 2015-16 prices) by 2022-23, needed real incomes to grow at CAGR of 10.4 per cent at the all India-level, and at differentiated rates at state-level. Graph-1 compares the actually achieved growth rates in farmers real incomes (NSSO 2002-03 to 2012-13) with growth rates required (2015-16 to 2022-23) to double farmers income.States like Bihar where real incomes of farmers was at (-)1 per cent (CAGR) between 2002-03 and 2012-13 would require a CAGR of 12.3 per cent between 2015-16 and 2022-23 to achieve the governments target. This sounds very unlikely. There are similar unrealistic expectations from other moderate-performing agricultural states like West Bengal, UP and Jharkhand.As two of the seven years have already passed and given the performance of agriculture in 2016-17 and 2017-18, the required CAGR in the remaining five years will have to be much higher than these rates. For example, instead of 10.4 per cent, the average incomes of farmers should grow at 13 per cent nationally if the goal is to be achieved. To achieve this, the Committee estimates that about Rs 6.4 lakh crore (at 2011-12 prices) is needed by the country as additional investment. Eighty per cent of this must come from the government. Interestingly, the committee does not mention how the government intends to mobilise this amount.On February 19-20, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare organised a conference, Agriculture2022-Doubling Farmers Income. About 300 stakeholders argued their case. The PM shared his aim to overhaul the agriculture sector and double farmers incomes through a four-pronged strategy. This involves reducing costs of cultivation (through neem-coating urea and soil health cards); ensuring better prices for produce (through new cost plus-pricing MSP formula, reforming agri-markets through e-NAM and upgrading 22,000 village-markets); reducing wastage in the value-chain (through proper storage, logistics, food processing, and implementing Operation Greens-TOP (tomatoes, onions and potatoes); and diversifying sources of farmer incomes (through blue, organic, sweet revolution).Overall, there were no dearth of recommendations. But how many of these will be accepted and implemented, and by when will they deliver, is anybodys guess.We may differ with the PM on the number of years needed to fulfill his dream, but we are with him in his drive to double farmers income. For the journey ahead, we have three suggestions/questions for him. First, can he dump the inherent consumer-bias in countrys marketing and trade policies? Massive and growing food subsidies (marred with high inefficiencies) is an example of such a bias. He needs to revisit the archaic ECA, revitalise inefficient APMCs, put an end to ad hoc export bans and ensure a stable policy-environment for domestic agri-trade and exports to flourish. Second, how does he plan to absorb the production boom that will result from implementation of various recommendations? Will consumption keep pace with production? Will the solution be in processing, exports or in augmenting demand? Third, can he dump the subsidy model and embrace an investment model? Of the total resources (Rs 3.66 lakh crores) going to agriculture (and food) (see Graph-2), can he restrict subsidies on food, MNREGA, and farm inputs to less than 25 per cent and increase share of investments in/for agriculture to 75 per cent? Unless the PM makes these bold and rational policy decisions, chances of augmenting farmer incomes are bleak, let alone doubling them by 2022-23.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

(Illustration: C R Sasikumar) The country lacks modern storage facilities and the links between processing and organised retailing are very weak. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)The finance minister announced Operation Greens, on the lines of Operation Flood, with a seed capital of Rs 500 crore in his speech on February 1. Three days later, the Prime Minister backed the scheme at a parivartan rally in Bengaluru. He said farmers are his TOP priority  T is for tomatoes, O for onions, and P for potatoes.Operation Flood changed the face of milk production in India, making the country the largest producer of milk in the world  in 2016-2017, the country produced 164 million metric tonnes (MMT). But its important to note that Operation Flood was driven largely by smallholders and the AMUL model has ensured that 75-80 per cent of the price paid by milk consumers goes to the farmers. Operation Greens wants to replicate that success story in fruit and vegetables, starting with tomatoes, onions and potatoes.The main objective of this project, according to the finance ministry, is to reduce price volatility in these commodities, thereby helping farmers augment incomes on a sustainable basis. It also aims to provide these vegetables to consumers at affordable prices. The litmus test of this scheme would be in containing the booms and busts in prices. It will need to avert situations where farmers have been forced to dump potatoes and tomatoes on roads. Also, checking the prices from going through the roof has compelled the government to ban exports. It has resorted to de-stocking and conducted income tax raids on traders  the raids on onion traders in September last year is a case in point.India is the second largest producer of vegetables in the world with about 180 MMT. But China produces four times more vegetables than India. The accompanying graph shows a structural break in Indias vegetable production around 2003-2004. Although not as revolutionary as the Green Revolution in wheat, or the White Revolution in milk, yields of potatoes, onions and tomatoes  which constitute almost half of the countrys vegetable production  have shown a healthy growth. For example, between 2003-2004 and 2017-2018, potato production increased from 28 MMT to 49 MMT while onion yields went up from 6.3 MMT to 21 MMT and tomato production increased from 8.1 MMT to 22 MMT.However, the problem with these commodities is that their prices collapse when their production rises sharply. This is because the country lacks modern storage facilities and the links between processing and organised retailing are very weak. As a result, farmers often end up receiving less than a fourth of what consumers pay in major cities. This must change. Operation Greens needs to ensure that farmers receive at least 60 per cent of what consumers pay. In the case of milk, the producers get more than 75 per cent of what consumers pay. The basic principles of Operation Flood would be useful to operationalise Operation Greens as well.What are these principles? First, link major consumption centres to major production centres with a minimal number of intermediaries. As Verghese Kurien wrote in his book, I too had a Dream, organising farmers and increasing production is an easier job. The real challenge is to find the right markets that can give them remunerative prices on a sustainable basis. So, one needs to map mega consuming centres and link their retail networks with the producing centres of each commodity. Farmers can be organised in farmer producer organisations (FPOs). NABARD and SFAC (Small farmers agribusiness consortium) together have about 3,000 FPOs, which could be the starting points for the aggregation of commodities, assaying, sorting, grading, and even packing with bar codes, reflecting their traceability.The Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act will have to be changed to allow direct buying from FPOs, and giving incentives to these organisations, private companies and NGOs to build back end infrastructure as was done in the case of milk. The announcement of tax concessions to FPOs for five years is a welcome step in that direction, if it encourages building such critical infrastructure.Second is the investment in logistics, starting with modern warehouses, that can minimise wastage. An example is of cold storage for onions, where wastage is reduced to less than 10 per cent, compared to the 25-30 per cent wastage in traditional storage facilities on farmers fields. Such storage facilities have to be cost effective. A potato cold storage in UP, for example, that buys power at almost Rs 10/kwh from SEBs, can become efficient by generating solar power at less than Rs 4/kwh. Large-scale investments in storage will require tweaking of the Essential Commodities Act.Third is linking the processing industry with organised retailing. On an average, about one-fourth of the produce must be processed. India is way behind on this curve compared to most Southeast Asian countries. Dehydrated onions, tomato puree and potato chips should become cheap, so that an average household can use them. Processing industry adds value and absorbs surpluses. Seen this way, the finance ministers announcement of increasing the allocation for the food processing industry by 100 per cent is a welcome step. The food processing ministry will have to coordinate with Operation Greens.By developing such forward and backward linkages, the government can ease large price fluctuations, raise farmers share in the price paid by the consumer and at the same time, ensure lower prices for the consumers  a win-win situation for all.However, Operation Greens would need a champion to implement this vision and strategy with honesty, another Kurien, for at least three to five years. A babu will not work. Can the government locate another Kurien?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

In Anna Karenina, only if a person is satisfied on all counts will she be happy. The allocations in the budget cover every sector, with umpteen implications, and no persons expectations can be fulfilled on all counts. While every expectation cant be met, it must be acknowledged that Finance Minister (FM) Arun Jaitley has presented a budget which focuses on rural India and is a great leap forward for the policy-battered farm sector. According to Article 112 of the Constitution, the Union Budget is simply a statement of the estimated receipts and expenditures of the government for a particular year.Rather than the budget being an annual jamboree for announcing policies, the prime minister should address the nation with his ideas for the coming year, based on which the FM should subsequently present the budget. The first step towards atonement and for penance is to acknowledge past failure. As the Economic Survey rightly states, real incomes of farmers have been stagnant. The next step is to take corrective measures and redeem the situation. An effort has been initiated in that direction in this budget.Assurance of purchase of all crops for which MSP is declared is a positive step. If the governments promise is of A2+50 per cent profit, then it is half-baked. It should have simultaneously announced acceptance of the Ramesh Chand Committees recommendations on the calculation of MSP, which it has not. The Niti Aayog is finally evolving into the credible policy think-tank we had been hoping for. It is also supposed to come out with a suitable mechanism to enable institutional credit access to lessee farmers.The Agri-Market Infrastructure Fund, with a corpus of Rs 2,000 crore, is to be set up for developing and upgrading agricultural marketing infrastructure in the 22,000 Gramin Agricultural Markets and 585 Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs). This will enable farmers in remote locations who are devoid of any institutional mechanism to connect to markets. Operation Green on the lines of Operation Flood to tackle the volatility of tomato, onion and potato prices is a positive development. The long-standing demand of income tax exemption for farmer producer organisations has been fulfilled. A Rs 10,000 crore fund to finance the infrastructure requirements of fisheries, aquaculture and animal husbandry will generate rural employment and supplement farmer incomes.The intent to mitigate the air pollution woes of Delhi-NCR by subsidising the machinery required for in-situ management of crop residue has now been addressed. Targeted programmes like those under the Prime Minister Krishi Sinchai Yojna for 96 irrigation-deprived districts, where less than 30 per cent of the land holdings get assured irrigation, is the way forward. The focus on horticulture clusters and converting cattle dung and solid waste in farms to compost, fertiliser, biogas and bio-CNG is also commendable.Read | Budget 2018 explained: Arun Jaitleys budget has no creative incrementalism on showThe flagship National Health Protection Scheme to cover over 50 crore poor and vulnerable beneficiaries providing coverage upto Rs 5 lakh per family per year for hospitalisation is outstanding. But the fund allocation for the programme is insignificant. I wonder if it will suffer the fate of many of last years budget announcements which have not materialised due to lack of allocations. In Davos, there was a general scepticism regarding the data presented to project the Indian growth story. A similar apprehension persists regarding the fund allocations in this budget.Climate change worries have not been addressed as agriculture R&D has been ignored. Nor is there a mention of the balanced use of fertilisers. The magic-bullet demand for changing the Centre-state funding ratio from 60:40 to 90:10 for agriculture-related schemes has unfortunately been overlooked.A constant red thread running uniformly through the budgets of the past 10 years, presented by three finance ministers of India, is that farmer suicides have not abated. In the last three years, over 36,000 farmers have committed suicide.Power is the capacity to change the lives of people. The prime minister must direct his immense power to bring the sorry saga of farmer suicides to an end. Budget allocations serve as the perfect instrument to change the narrative of resentment to one of hope. He must quickly solve farmers crises or heed the warning, given in different circumstances, by Benjamin Franklin: We must all hang together or most assuredly we will all hang separately.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Price of sambar onion has fallen from Rs 160/kg to Rs 35/kg since November, while the price of tomato reduced from Rs 20/kg to Rs 8/kg. Traders at the market said that the fall in price will persist for three more weeks till the second crop of the year comes along.Koyambedu vegetables, fruits and flowers traders welfare association president M Thyagarajan , who is a tomato trader, said, Usually, we receive 400-450 loads of vegetables daily. But now we are getting nearly 550 loads. Yield from the first crop of the year (December  January) is usually the highest due to cold weather and availability of excess water. Price of vegetables is set to gradually rise with the arrival of the second crop from February 20.Water-rich vegetables like turnip (nookal), radish (mullangi), chayote (chow chow), beetroot, okra (vendakkai), snake gourd (pudalangai) and white pumpkin (poosanikkai) are now priced at Rs 5- Rs 10. Koyambedu vegetables, fruits and flowers traders welfare association treasurer P G M Sukumar said, Foreign (non-indigenous) vegetables like cabbage, carrot, and capsicum require a greater amount of water to grow as compared to the local varieties. Price of these vegetables has fallen thanks to an excess rainfall.According to traders, the first crop yield is 100kg per acre while second crop (February-March) yield is only 50kg/acre. The wholesale price of vegetables like nookal and mullangi was Rs 5, while their retail price was Rs 10 on Monday.The price of tomato fell gradually since November 2017. Sukumar said, In November, the price of tomato was Rs 20/kg. It fell to Rs 15 in early December and by the end of the month, it was Rs 10. Now the price is Rs 8. Only the price of drumstick (Rs 50- Rs 60/kg) has remained stable since November 2017."

(Archive) With assembly elections in 10 states due later this year, the states going to the polls are making attempts to woo farmers. (Archive)Farm distress is likely to be one of the major focal points of the upcoming Union Budget. Agri-GDP growth has fallen to around 2 per cent per annum in the first four years of the Modi government; the real incomes of farmers have fallen as well. The growth in the agriculture sector is much below the Centres target and the government does not seem to be on course to double farmers incomes by 2022. With assembly elections in 10 states due later this year, the states going to the polls are making attempts to woo farmers. While some have announced loan waivers, others are trying to fix farmers woes emanating from tumbling farm prices. Here, we focus on two pilot projects to see if they can be scaled-up at the all India level.The first is the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (BBY), essentially a price deficiency payment (PDP) scheme, being undertaken by the government of Madhya Pradesh. BBY applies to eight kharif crops  soybean, maize, urad, tur, moong, groundnut, til, ramtil. The Haryana government has announced a somewhat similar scheme for four vegetables  potatoes, onions, tomatoes and cauliflower. The second pilot scheme we talk about is underway in Telangana, where the government gives all farmers an investment support for their working capital needs.Under the BBY, farmers have to first register on a portal. Their sown area is verified by government officials. They are then asked to bring their produce to mandis at a time fixed by the state government. Based on average productivity of a crop in the district and area cultivated by the farmer, the quantity of each produce that is eligible for deficiency payment is also determined by the government. Farmers receive the difference between average sale price (ASP) and MSP directly into their bank accounts. The scheme seems interesting as it provides an alternative to physical procurement of commodities at minimum support prices (MSPs). The ASP is calculated as the simple average of the weighted modal prices of the relevant crops in the regulated mandis of Madhya Pradesh and two adjoining states. The price information is drawn from the Centres agmarknet.gov.in portal.For kharif 2017-18, so far, data related to five crops (soybean, maize, groundnut, urad and moong) has been finalised for price deficiency payment. The market prices of til and ramtil are higher than the MSP and therefore they do not qualify for price deficiency payment. The tur season will start from February.The graph shows the key results of BBY for October-December, 2017. It is interesting to note that only 32 per cent of urad production in Madhya Pradesh got the yojanas benefit despite the fact that ASP of urad was 42 per cent below its MSP. In other words, 68 per cent of urad production was sold at prices below MSP, without any compensation under BBY. In the case of soybean, the states prime kharif crop, the percentage of production benefiting from this scheme is even lower  only 18.5 per cent, despite its ASP being 12 per cent below the MSP. And for maize, groundnut and moong, the coverage is even poorer (see graph).Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana: Who gained and how much? Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana: Who gained and how much?The Madhya Pradesh government claims to have paid about Rs 1,900 crore as compensation to farmers for these five crops. But that pertains to only those farmers registered on its portal. A larger proportion of farmers are not registered on the portal and they have been selling their produce at huge losses. These farmers have not received any compensation. In fact, those not registered under BBY have to suffer bigger losses because traders are suppressing the market. We have calculated their loss by multiplying the production not covered under BBY with the price difference between MSP and ASP. The actual prices in Madhya Pradesh are even lower than the ASP, which is the average of modal prices of three states. The total loss for these five crops comes to Rs 6,534 crore. So, if the scheme was fully successful and covered entire production, the Madhya Pradesh governments revenue outgo would be Rs 8,434 crore, and not Rs 1,900 crore. This would be more than 90 per cent of the states total budget for agriculture. In sum, BBY is not inclusive, covers less than 25 per cent of the farmers loss, involves too much micro-management by government officials and is prone to market manipulation.Haryanas scheme for four vegetables is even worse as the presumed MSP (Rs 400 per quintal for potatoes and tomatoes and Rs 500 per quintal for onions and cauliflower) does not even cover the full cost of production as estimated by the Union Ministry of Agriculture and the National Horticulture Board for these crops.In contrast to these programmes is the government of Telanganas input support scheme. Announced in the second week of January, the schemes objective is to relieve farmers from taking loans from moneylenders by giving them Rs 4,000 per acre for the kharif and rabi seasons. It is envisaged that the farmer will use this money for purchase of inputs ranging from seeds to fertilisers to machinery and hired labour. The area eligible for investment support is 14.21 million acre  the governments annual bill for the project, thus, comes to around Rs 5,685 crore.The Telangana model does not require the farmer to register his cultivated area and crops. The farmer is free to grow a crop of his choice and sell it anytime in a mandi of his choice. This model is crop-neutral, more equitable, more transparent, and gives farmers the freedom to choose. Incidentally, China has a similar scheme: It gives aggregate input subsidy support on a per acre basis. The scheme does not distort markets and is worth following.

Elamurugan believed that a pleasant ambience will help students learn better and set about creating a park around the school. The students of this school have identity cards like their private school counterparts, thanks to Elamurugan who spent from his pocket and collected money from alumni to provide this. For two years he has been providing snacks and tiffin, with the help of sponsors, to students who are preparing for SSLC and Plus Two examinations.The school, started in 1962, now has 903 students from classes VI to XII. ""Twenty-five years ago, I was working in a private school which had a lot of facilities for students. I cleared the teachers recruitment board exam and taught physics to Plus One and Plus Two students. After I became the headmaster of the school, I decided to do something for the students with the help of fellow teachers,"" said Elamurugan.""We issued identity cards for all students and teachers. We selected a group of students and made them members of the students protection committee. The group had to ensure that all students kept their nails and hair neatly trimmed. The names of those who do not maintain this are sent to the physical education teacher. If the students do not maintain discipline, their parents will be approached,"" said Elamurugan.The school also started a career guidance centre where students were prepared for competitive exams. ""The students live in villages and do not have much awareness about competitive exams. To promote savings and to create awareness about banking services, we opened bank accounts for 450 students and requested them to save money,"" he said.The school also has a counselling centre for students to beat stress. ""The parents of the many students are daily wage labourers and sometimes their family problems affect the children. So we give free counselling to the students and invite their parents to talk about their problems. In one case, a couple reunited for the sake of their sons future,"" said Elamurugan.He said a herbal garden on the school premises was maintained by a team of students. Another garden too is maintained by a team of students. Tomatos, chillies, and spinach are cultivated on the premises and these are used for the noon meal scheme.""We have two smart class rooms for students of Classes VI to XII. Our campus has an incinerator to burn sanitary napkins. We have a sanitary committee for girl students, with a few women teachers as committee leaders.

Sindhu goes on about the freedom struggle while Samirah interrupts, Mamma, you should get a bigger plate for me. I wanted India Gate too.A mom who is well aware that the surefire way to instil patriotism in children is through the stomach, she cooks up a patriotic storm every Indian Independence Day and Republic Day. As we live in Seattle, Washington, and as she misses the festivities of our country, wherever there is any festival of India, we have food art at home. I narrate her stories related to our country while feeding her. And it never felt like a herculean task, says Sindhu.In Abudhabi, medical professional Sandya Menon too had a similar worry about her children Adithya Anoop and Advaith Anoop missing out on Indian culture. She too decided to go creative on the dining table by way of a solution. Come Republic Day and Independence Day, it is tricolour that is dished out. I keep on experimenting with different cuisines. I believe it is the best way to teach them about their nation and the spirit of Republic Day. And my narration of stories via food begin a week before. As they love sweets, I made tricolour vanilla sponge cake and cupcakes and will follow them up with puddings and pedas, she says.It seems to be a trend for NRIs to celebrate Republic Day with flavoured ideas. Rajeev Maravayal and Sangeetha Rajeev live in Canada and Sangeetha likes to surprise her hubby with a sweet dish on special occasions. On days related to India, I make sure to celebrate it with a special sweet, Sangeetha says. Madagascan vanilla bean cupcake is what she made for Rajeev on Independence Day and today, she is planning to serve a tricolour kesari for breakfast.Parvathy Menon, based in the US, packs such surprises in her better half Kirans lunch box. This time, I am making tiranga pulav using green chilies, tomato puree and rice. I will be serving salads and pickle along with it. I am inspired from my mom Prasanna Menon, she says. Prasannas masterpiece is yard long beans plus Carrot Sabji with Rice, an India special that is a hit with Parvathys friends. It is very simple and healthy as well, she adds.Marketing professional Jyothika Roy, who works in Dubai, rustles up trilicious pasta on such occasions. The word 'tricolour' or 'Tiranga' itself brings a sense of patriotism in all Indians. Indian festivals are always brighter and mightier for us who live outside India. Food plays an important role in such get-togethers. People often enjoy preparing food with the theme of tricolour, she says. For green sauce she has used spinach and the ingredients of white sauce is refined flour, milk and butter and the red Sauce base is of tomato.Tarun Alex from Ranni who is passionate about cooking is on a vacation at Dubai and is planning a South Indian breakfast for his friends, the speciality being tricolour idlis.

This young bio-technologist decided to make use of her degree and knowledge to make a change in the environment for the better.What started as a hobby, soon turned into a profession says Mansi, Due to my mother who has a green thumb even when we were kids we were always inclined towards growing plants and had a mini garden in the balcony. The love for greenery grew and with the help of my dad who has a printing press I decided to incorporate seeds in plain paper which can then grow into plants.Along with paper for gift wrapping, writing, note pads, invites, etc., Mansi also made mud modaks during the Ganapati festival and mud rangoli tiles during Diwali , all infused with paper seeds. And that is how the flags infused with paper seeds too was an idea that she thought of. We were already on a spree to make sure our festivals are green with green modaks and rangolis when I came up with the idea last year in January just before Republic Day. I started thinking about making such a product when I saw a lot of paper flags being made and sold at signals. What upset me though is that we see these same flags being dumped into the trash later that day or the next day. I realised that we as Indians claim to be patriotic in the way of listening to patriotic songs, hoisting our flag, etc., but we dont give a second thought to what happens to those flags post Republic or Independence Day. I realised I can initiate and make some change, so why not. We produced approximately 1000 seed paper flags about a week before Republic Day with the message Dont throw, grow me printed on the back. The idea is to encourage people to grow these flags into plants as opposed to just throwing them out. We made sure its fine to plant a flag and followed the Indian Flag code.The flags are made of handmade paper infused with seeds and the screen print uses vegetable inks. Talking about the seeds that go into the flag, Mansi says, We infuse the paper with a variety of seeds ranging from chilli and marigold to basil, tomato and tulsi. With the flags, in particular, we dont use different seeds for different colours but with other products this can be customised based on the requirement.Mansi remembers how initially when they distributed the flags in a housing society the enthusiasm of the children was infectious, They all made sure their parents, grandparents and friends all planted their flags and that no one threw them out. I have a very special memory of interacting with some children who had no idea what to do with the regular flags once they were done wearing them. On finding out that they could plant our flags they jumped up with excitement and started to enquire how they should plant it, what plant would emerge etc. Seeing their happy, excited reactions was thrilling and I knew that Im on the right path.The interest is ever growing and as compared to last year when Mansi started making paper seed flags to this year the response has been encouraging. Says Mansi, We, are now happy that this Republic Day there are many more flags out there which will grow into little plants and in their little way help preserve nature. And we all must know and realise the fact that there is no Planet B."

The experiment has yielded very good results and last year 500 households produced 48,000kg of the produce.The trust is calling this initiative nutrition farming and is insisting that none of these produces be sold in the market. We want every child in the family to have access to the balanced diet from their own produce. We discourage people to sell their produce and ask them to consume it within the family to fight malnutrition. We have been carrying out this experiment for last few years. Last year, there was a record produce of 48,000kg from 500 families, said Dr Satav.Earlier, the tribals grew only rice. Now they are growing jowar, soyabean, all major vegetables like ladys finger, carrot, radish, methi, palak, tomato, chilli, 5-8 types of different protein rich beans and peanuts.The Trust has taught them scientific selection of crops which include cereals, pulses, vegetables, vegetables rich in vitamins and minerals and oilseeds.A model farm was set up in the Trusts premises  an acres area housing hospital and residences of doctors and staff  at Karamagram in Utavali village. The integrating farming included crops like gram, rajgira, five types of beans, turmeric, chilli, tapioca, sweet potato, linseed fruits like papaya, amla, banana, chikoo and goti tea grass.Being a rain-fed area, Melghat gets no water from irrigation projects. So, tribals use the entire waste water from kitchen and houses for maintaining the garden. The patients visiting the hospital saw the farm and adopted the model gradually, said Dr Satav.Dr Satav says that there is a visible change in the health of tribals, especially children. He said the Trust will be monitoring the changes with scientific parameters, comparing them with population which does not have access to balanced diet on large-scale, and publish the results.Though we have been using the intervention model which uses ready-to-eat therapeutic foods for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and severe underweight (SUW) and that too has yielded very good results, in the long run cultivating the required food and consuming it is the only solution to malnutrition, said Dr Satav.The malnutrition rate in the 17 villages under various projects of Mahan Trust has gone down by 50%. Though the SAM rate in Melghat is about 7-8%, this figure in the project area under Mahan has reduced to just 1%. Similarly, the SUW rate in Melghat is 14-15% while it is 10% in the 17 intervention villages."

So, this has reflected in a significant drop , he said.While one kilogram of onion cost anything between Rs 30/kg and Rs 40/kg, potato and yam sold for Rs 15/kg to Rs 20/kg and Rs 20/kg to Rs 25/kg.The wholesale market received 450 trucks of vegetables and about 50 vehicles more to meet the demand for Pongal from different parts of Tamil Nadu , Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka The situation in the retail markets, however, was different, with residents in many areas saying prices were much higher.Responding to this, Chandran said retail traders would factor in a minimum a profit margin of Rs 10 for every kilogram of vegetables to meet the expenses incurred in transporting the goods to respective places."

Maintained jointly by teachers and students from classes VI to VIII, without affecting their classroom sessions, around 50-60 kg of vegetables of nine plant varieties are harvested at the school every week and supplied to the school kitchen for the noon meal scheme.The school has classes for standards I to VIII and a student strength of 140, of which classes up to standard IV are taught both English and in Tamil medium. Vegetable cultivation being done on about 0.25 acres within the school campus.Started in September 2016 with the personal interest of 42-year-old teacher S Elavalagan and subsequent cooperation from fellow staff, the green project expanded the acreage of horticulture crops from just 5 cents to 0.25 acres. Teachers along with the students would engage in vegetable plantation and also in maintaining existing plants. It is the self-interest of 57 students studying from classes VI to VIII that allowed the acreage of horticulture crops to expand. Parents are also supportive in the move as they willingly send their wards to school even on Sundays, S Elavalagan told TOI.With seeds obtained at free of cost from Indian Institute of Horticulture Research, Bengaluru, through good Samaritans , the school has planted about 18 vegetable varieties of which nine varieties render substantial yield on daily and weekly basis.Belonging to the small onion belt of Tamil Nadu , the school last week cultivated small onions within their campus and new vegetable breeds such as carrots, beetroot, cauliflower and cabbage. For the last one year we have been cultivating and harvesting tomato, ladies finger, bitter gourd, snake gourd and broad beans. Most of the yield will go to the school kitchen for preparing noon meals for the children and the surplus, on rotational basis, would be provided free of cost to the families of students who actively maintain the crops, Elavalagan added.The school with as many as seven teachers including the headmaster perhaps could have made revenue by selling the surplus vegetables to the shops, but instead preferred to plant green thoughts among students by giving harvested vegetables to students as a pat on their backs.M Guru, a class VII student, said that the green activity in school has motivated him to pursue farming in future and said that his parents were happy about their ward spending quality time in farming. My father migrated from agriculture even though my grandfather was a farmer. Completing my studies, I will certainly take up farming since it has become my passion, said Guru, spotted watering the vegetable plants on the school campus on Sunday.Another student of the school, R Kalaiselvan said that he feels relaxed while watering the plants rather than playing cricket with his friends. On an average, each week, at least 5-10 children are taking home surplus vegetable for which feedback from their houses is positive as the vegetables are grown organically."

Anil Kumar and senior functionaries of CFTRI to work out action plans to address the issue.Das was accompanied by chief secretary Sudhir Tripathi, additional chief secretary (finance) Sukhdev Singh, rural development principal secretary Avinash Kumar, industry secretary Sunil Kumar Barnwal, social welfare secretary Vinay Kumar Choube and state's nutrition mission director general D.K. Saxena.After detailed deliberations, the chief minister asked the DFRL representatives to provide equipment and training to the sakhi mandals.Initially, 12 food processing machines will be installed across the state - one machine for two districts.The machines will be handled by the sakhi mandals, who will also be responsible for transporting the packaged food to anganwadis. Some of the women will also be trained to become master trainers to mentor other women.To smoothly run these food processing units - with jobs ranging from installation of machines to transportation of packaged food - the sakhi mandals will be provided loans under Mudra Loan and Start-up India projects.Das said that since most of the malnutrition-triggered diseases were mainly caused by deficiency of protein, iron and fat, these factors should adequately be taken care of while preparing the ready-to-eat food.""For example, children like chocolates. We must make chocolates that can neutralise protein deficiency in their bodies,"" he stated later in a news release.The chief minister went on to say that since tomato, tamarind, peas and beans were abundantly grown in Jharkhand, his government would take initiatives to bring these to the food processing centres for production of sauces, jams and other products that would then be sold in the local market.""A healthy future generation is our primary objective. Money will never be a constraint to make our children healthy and sisters and daughters financially self-sufficient. Let us complete the necessary formalities at the earliest so that work can start in the new fiscal beginning on April 1,"" Das added."

Along the 856km border between them, much of which is fenced, Indian families live outside the barrier, connected with gates manned by the BSF.On Sunday, when Assembly elections will be held in Tripura, these residents will come out of their caged existence to cast their ballots. At Jainagar here, 39 Muslim families had their homes on the wrong side when the fence came up nearly 12 years ago. Since then, their movements are restricted by the clock - the gates open at 6am and close at 8.30pm.Along the border, these gates are numbered. At Gate 86, young Sofikul seeks the BSF sentry's permission to come out with his bicycle and head to school. He needs to make a written entry and produce his identity card and a yellow gate pass issued by the BSF.Hasina Khatun, 55, needs to go back home inside the fence, so her name is marked on the register at the gate.She had accompanied her 32-year-old son, Bashir Mia to hospital to treat a deep cut on his palm. Hasina rues having to adhere to gate deadlines; it impinges on her freedom of movement especially when there are family celebrations in town. ""If we are late in returning, we have to spend the night with relatives outside. We appreciate the security, especially with our paddy fields and tomato patches safe from intruders. But it is like living in a cage. On voting day, we will have to leave home early,"" she says.""There is no mosque inside, so we need to come out even for prayers,"" adds Bashir.The opening and closing of these gates is strictly regulated. The BSF sentries deposit the keys at the camp and the procedure to reopen the gates in an emergency involves securing permission from the authorities, the BSF company commander at Konaban in Sipahijala district, Pawan Yadav explains.Having travelled 60km along the fencing, with a lone sentry at each gate, one reaches the Kamalasagar company headquarters of the force. The security on this smuggling-prone stretch is double-layered: area domination patrols by day and ambush-cum-patrol teams at night. At Radhanagar, Abul Kasam Mia, Joydeep Debnath and Dhirendra Debnath stand at the CPM rally kiosk. The sitting MLA, Narayan Chandra Chowdhury, looks set to retain his seat here.On reaching Belabor (Gate 92), we find villagers Abdul Majid and Sajal Mia emerging from the gates. Theirs is a piquant situation: their homes are on the Indian side of the gate, but the farmland lies on the other side, so they make multiple entries during the day. At Gate 98 at Motinagar, 400 people live inside the fence.On Sunday, these voters will troop out and head for the nearest booth, the village barely discernible from the border road.

But there is an unlikely candidate this time, mangoes. Several factors seem to have ganged up to create such a situation.The APMC yard here has turned into a virtual trash bin as the fruits are rotting, but there are hardly any buyers. The furious growers are throwing the mangoes into the drains and on the roads. Among the reasons for the price crash are excess production and fall in demand from the middlemen.The rates have fallen to as little as Rs 10-12 a kilo for the Badami variety. The other varieties of mangoes are priced at Rs 4-5 a kg, down from Rs 100 a few days ago.Varieties like Sendur, Rasapuri and Neelam have no takers. Buyers purchased 240 quintals of Badami mangoes at Rs 900 to Rs 1,000 per quintal. Other varieties (740 quintals) sold at Rs 500-600 per quintal. Even tomato is commanding a better price than mangoes, say the growers.Many lorry loads of mango are returning to the market as some buyers are sending them back due to excesssupply. Earlier, these buyers, mostly juice producers, used to fall over each other to buy both ripe and raw mangoes. However, this time, the buyers are imposing conditions on what they want.Nipah scareThe scare of the spread of Nipah virus through mangoes has discouraged retail consumers from buying them and so, the demand has crashed. Besides, there is a glut in production in Kolar, another major production centre.Many growers have left the mangoes to rot on the trees as they dont want to spend on the labour for plucking in the current situation."

In the first phase, the state became cent per cent organic producer.D. K. Bhandari, the director of the horticulture department, said to begin with, two floors of the multi-storied complex would be given to the farmers to sell their produce. ""Later, 85 stalls in the complex will be let out to the farmers. The complex will also house two cold storages and a canteen,"" he added.Similar complexes will also be constructed at Namchi in South Sikkim, Geyzing in West Sikkim and Mangan in North Sikkim. ""The Kisan Bazar will be open on all seven days of the week. The farmers can sell their vegetables from these complexes at their own prices,"" said Bhandari.The horticulture director, however, said once a stall was allotted to a local farmer, he or she would not be allowed to sub-let the places to others. ""If anyone is found sub-letting the stall, the allotment will be cancelled. This is being done to ensure that no middlemen get to usurp the stalls,"" he said.The government has also provided utility vehicles at different locations to enable farmers to ferry their produce to the nearby markets. ""We have provided 24 utility vehicles and three refrigerated vans to ferry vegetables. SIMFED (Sikkim State Co-operative Supply and Marketing Federation Ltd.) also has six vehicles (to ferry vegetables),"" said Bhandari.Pawan Awasthy, the managing director of the government-owned SIMFED, said given the fact that organic vegetables were costlier than the non-organic ones, his cooperative would try to sell vegetables at subsidised rates to customers. ""For instance, if we buy tomatoes from farmers at Rs 28 per kg, we will sell them at Rs 20. We will absorb the losses. Even though we are committed to giving subsidy as much as possible, it will not be to the extent of non-organic (rates),"" he said.Non-organic tomatoes procured from outside are being sold at Rs 15 per kilogram. Tomatoes are among the items exempted from the purview of the ban. Other vegetables include potato, garlic, radish and green chilli.The horticulture director said the government would also provide minimum support prices to farmers and offer them compensation for vegetables that they are unable to sell in order to encourage them to grow more vegetables.

""Say for example, the daily demand for cauliflowers in Gangtok alone is 18,000 kilograms, but today we were only given 1,000 kilograms. Who is going to make up for the shortfall?"" he asked. Cauliflowers apart, the government provided beans, leafy vegetables, among others.Khorlo Bhutia, the horticulture secretary, said the government was doing all it can to normalise the situation, but given the larger scope of the organic mission, it would require the support of all sections of society to make it a success.""We are using all the machinery at our disposal to meet the situation.

5b2e78bc9855b72640115dac,Farm crisis real but can be tackled,http://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/farm-crisis-real-can-be-tackled-667754.html,2018-05-02,,Deccan Herald,"One of the oldest civilisations, the Indus Valley civilisation, vanished because of persistent drought. This is a stark reminder to policymakers that they will have to tackle persistent drought in parts of the country failing which civilisation could disappear in a couple of centuries. Farm crisis in India is real, particularly in states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which is going to witness yet another drought this year despite good monsoon forecast for the third consecutive year in the rest of the country.This is one side of the coin but Agriculture Secretary S K Pattanayak, a Karnataka cadre IAS officer, argues that all is not bad with Indian agriculture. It has come a long way and this year India is going to have a bumper crop with food grain production touching a record 275 million tonnes, while horticulture, including fruits and vegetables, will produce a record additional 300 million tonnes. Also, the country has had a record bumper harvest of 23.6 million tonnes in pulses, the only source of protein to the vast vegetarian population.But the stark reality is that farming is the livelihood for half of the 1.25 billion people of India. A farmer must get a remunerative price and adequate income. Already next generation of farmers are moving away from farming and this could have a catastrophic effect on who will feed the 125 crore people, which is not a small number. Also, if the Indian economy has to clock a double-digit growth on a sustained basis, the farm sector has to grow by at least 4% annually on a continuous basis, which has not happened so far. This is necessary to ensure poverty is eradicated.For the woes of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu farmers, Pattanayak said they should change their cropping pattern from water-guzzling crops like paddy and sugarcane and switch over to drip irrigation, which will reduce water consumption drastically. It is a crime to cultivate sugarcane in Maharashtra. Sugarcane should be cultivated in flood-prone areas of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and perhaps the Northeast as it could also be flood protected.Punjab should not be cultivating basmati rice. The practice of which has brought down the water table to a dangerous level. Israel, which has a mere 300 mm of average rainfall, did not find water shortage a major problem and its farm yield is one of the highest. India gets bountiful rainfall and perhaps one of the few countries to have monsoon as a season every year.Even in the arid zones of Rajasthan and Karnataka, the average rainfall is around 800 mm, which is more than double that of Israel. All one has to do is harness this through rainwater harvesting so that fresh water does not go unutilised into the sea. The government, therefore, is rightly giving priority to minor irrigation and desilting of all the existing tanks, besides immediately taking up 99 stalled irrigation projects. This has to be done on a war footing.What is needed now is to make agriculture smart, which has not happened so far in India despite the Green Revolution that only ensured there are no more starvation deaths. Farmers income needs to be not only doubled but at least quadrupled from the present level of Rs 20,000 annually. One way could be to provide income support as in the US instead of price support by way of Minimum Support Price (MSP). Because of high MSP for certain crops like food grains, rich farmers grow these crops to take advantage of procurement as only they have a marketable surplus.The top 10% of Indian farmers produce 60-70% of marketable surplus in food grains. The remaining 90% have only 30% of marketable surplus and hence they get very little benefit from the price support system. The resulting depression of prices for poor farmers in the market leads to distress sale of the small quantity they produce.If income support is given instead, market forces will come into play and the farmer can produce any crop that the market demands and not only those that have price support, which leads to excess production and subsequent depression of prices. This will also ensure that crop failures do not hit farmers hard.If farmers income has to rise, the dependence only on agriculture for income has to change and farmers will have to take to animal husbandry, poultry, fisheries, food processing and other agri-related rural industries and so on for augmenting income. This is because farming by its very nature is seasonal and hence there is disguised unemployment even in the best of times.As the Swaminathan Committee has pointed out, market access to poor farmers is a major problem in India. Bumper tomato crop forces a farmer to sell it at Re 1 per kg but in the retail market, it is not available for less than Rs 20. But Re 1 does not cover even the cost of production. A farmer gets Rs 6 per coconut but in the retail market, it is not available for less than Rs 40. Who then gets the benefit? It is neither the farmer nor the consumer but the rich middlemen.So what is the way out? An Amul like cooperative model that brought about the White Revolution has to be replicated for all crops so that farmers get a remunerative price and the food products are marketed better and exported. The wastage of fruit, vegetables and other crops running into thousands of crores can be minimised. This will facilitate setting up of common cold storage for horticulture produce in areas where they are grown.Amul like cooperatives will also ensure crop insurance, better quality seeds, pesticides and other inputs, thereby minimising crop failures and loss of farm income.--(The writer is a senior journalist based in New Delhi)"

The bulk of treatment methods viz. chemotherapy, radiation and surgery, involve much pain and severe side effects.Newer, less toxic and less painful therapies have brought significant relief in managing cancers and some decline in mortality due to cancer has been recorded in a few developed countries (US, Denmark, Sweden and Slovakia) as per a study published in The Lancet. Yet, overall, it remains a serious health threat worldwideGlobally, over 7 million deaths occur due to cancer yearly. In 2016, $113 billion was spent on therapeutic and supportive care of those living with the disease, a figure projected to grow to $147 billion by 2021.In lay terms, cancer is the attrition of healthy cells due to loss of activity over time. Only those body parts and organs that remain active maintain blood flow essential to stay healthy; this purpose is served by regular exercise prescribed for fitness. Sedentary living is known to raise cancer risk especially that of colon or lung or among men and endometrial and breast cancer among women.""Physical activity: even if you don't lose an ounce, you'll live longer, feel healthier and be less likely to get cancer, heart disease, stroke and arthritis. It's the closest thing we have to a wonder drug,"" says Tom Frieden, former director, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Further, acknowledging the limited success of medications, health experts now advise integrated approach including exercise, yoga, vegetarian diet and psychological wellbeing for cancer and other ailments. After positive outcomes from multi-location studies, intake of antioxidant-rich lemon, ginger, turmeric, cucumber, ever part of Indian cuisine, is being advocated for prevention and treatment of cancers.Lab trials at Georgia State University have shown a 10,000 times superior efficacy of ginger and turmeric vis--vis chemotherapy in cancer. Advising reduced intake of non-veg foods, the American Institute for Cancer Research recommends no more than one-third of animal protein in daily diet.Lab studies have also shown efficacy of folate-rich vegetables and fruit, particularly the deep coloured ones which contain cancer-fighting nutrients and help maintain body weight. These include beans, sunflower seeds, green leafy vegetables,green tea, cabbages and tomato and berries. Adequate intake of water and other fluids that dilute toxic concentration of cancer-causing agents in the bladder is also recommended.What makes cancer management tough is the erratic movement of cancer cells and their rapid growth that follows no pre-determined pattern and transmits to other body parts damaging the normal cells. Second, most cases are detected in later stages due to the lack of awareness among people; many women ignore the problem and approach the surgeon only when a tumour has stretched 8-10 cm long.To provide affordable and equitable care, public awareness on cancer along with expanding screening centres needs to be our top priority, says Dr Anand Purushotham, director at King's Health Partners Comprehensive Care Centre. The third handicap in most developing countries is the resource crunch. ""India is spending less than half of what it should be doing on cancer care,"" regrets Dr Anand.Once diagnosed with cancer, those around the patient tend to socially ostracise him/her unfairly at times. Ironically, however, this is a phase when one needs greater moral and other kinds support to accept the condition and pass their remaining days with minimal stress and peace.A patient should be impressed upon, as CC Scott said, that the human spirit is stronger than anything that can happen to it. Small gestures like the presence of loved ones and normal conversations, delivering meals, accompanying the patient to a healthcare facility, supplying essentials, keeping them updated with events and involving them in activities of their liking can trigger positive vibes and facilitate recovery.People diagnosed with cancer should be treated the usual way, with just a little extra love so that they do not lose their morale to fight back against the disease. As Michael Landon, the American writer, stage artist, director and producer said before he died of pancreatic cancer in 1991, ""I'm going to beat this cancer or die trying."""
5b2e7d389855b72640115e9c,"Farm price, market assurance will bloat fiscal deficit",http://www.deccanherald.com/edit/panorama/farm-price-market-assurance-will-bloat-fiscal-deficit-665363.html,2018-04-18,,Deccan Herald,"Stung by depressed price-realisation by farmers, much below the minimum support price (MSP), and with impending general elections next year, the Narendra Modi government announced in the Union Budget for 2018-19 that henceforth, they will be assured MSP which is at least 1.5 times the cost of production.Mere assurance of a remunerative price is of no use unless the farmer is able to sell his entire produce at this price. Keen to ensure that this happens, the government asked NITI Aayog to come up with suggestions. The latter prescribed three alternatives, namely: market assurance scheme (MAS) or price deficiency payments or incentives to private sector to buy farmers produce at MSP.Under MAS, agencies of the state buy the produce directly from farmers at MSP. Under the second option, the government does not buy, but instead it reimburses the shortfall in price realised from sale (albeit in the mandi) vis--vis the MSP. Under the third alternative, the private sector is incentivised to buy at MSP.In the follow through, a group of ministers (GoM) under Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh has approved nationwide implementation of MAS covering 23 agricultural crops, including wheat and rice. The scheme will cover up to 40% of the marketable surplus and cap the price loss (difference between farm harvest prices and MSP) to be eligible for compensation at 25% of MSP.The Union government, apart from absorbing procurement cost in full (roughly 15% of MSP), will bear 100% of the price loss up to 20% of the MSP and half the price loss between 20% and 25% of MSP. The states will share only half of the shortfall between 20% and 25%. Of the overall cost of the scheme, the Centres share would be 93.75% and the states will contribute 6.25%. The states will have to pay for any additional support they wish to give farmers.Though bandied about as a revolutionary step in the overarching mission of doubling farmers income, the expected outcome is doubtful even as the scheme holds dangerous portends for both the Union government and the states via increasing their respective subsidy bills.During 2017-18, the total payment on food subsidy under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) was Rs 1,40,000 crore, including Rs 1,15,000 crore towards excess of procurement price over the heavily subsidised issue price of wheat, rice and coarse cereals (Rs 1/2/3 per kg respectively) for sale through the public distribution system (PDS) and Rs 25,000 crore as incidental cost on storage and handling. Additionally, the government spent Rs 35,000 crore on the price support scheme for pulses and oilseeds, taking the total to Rs 1,75,000 crore.As for 2018-19, according to NITI Aayog, the total cost of MAS is estimated to be about Rs 1,11,000 crore. Of this, the Centre will bear about Rs 1,05,000 crore. Together with Rs 1,15,000 crore being the subsidy to cover the excess of procurement price over issue price under NFSA (same as last year), the total outgo would be Rs 2,20,000 crore. This is an increase of Rs 45,000 crore over the corresponding amount spent during 2017-18. Against the budget allocation of Rs 1,69,000 crore for 2018-19, this is higher by Rs 51,000 crore and will have a destabilising effect on the fiscal deficit.One wonders whether central agencies such as the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and state institutions have the infrastructure and wherewithal to carry out procurement operations on the scale contemplated under the scheme. The experience with similar schemes run in the past for specific crops, such as pulses, oilseeds, vegetables (onion, tomato, etc) scale does not instil confidence. That apart, with the compensation capped at 25% of MSP, besides limiting purchase to 40% of the marketable surplus would still leave farmers dissatisfied.Furthermore, has the government thought through the fate of millions of subsistence farmers who do not have a marketable surplus (they produce food primarily for self-consumption) and a vast number of landless workers who depend entirely on the PDS or market? While they have nothing to gain from the price support scheme, they will be hit by the inflation triggered by it; all the more when the quota for subsidised supply under NFSA, namely five kilos per person per month, is far from being adequate in relation to the need.The responsibility for disposal of the stocks purchased from farmers lies entirely with the states. In order that the state does not suffer a loss on its sale, it should at least realise the effective purchase price (MSP minus price loss support) plus the carrying cost. If it does not  the most likely scenario  then it could suffer loss. This would be in addition to their 6.25% share under the scheme and would be seriously destabilising on the overall finances of the state.The scheme is hugely negative for the finances of the Centre and the states besides for subsistence farmers and landless workers, even as the intended impact (albeit positive) on farmers offering marketable surplus will be seriously constrained by the weaknesses in state procurement, handling and distribution machinery.Policy reforms neededThere is an inherent flaw in the approach. The government is looking for an administrative solution to a problem that requires policy reforms. If the farmers are not getting a good price, it is because the markets for agri-produce are monopolised by intermediaries (in many cases, politicians or their relatives) licensed by state authorities to buy their stuff in designated mandis/market platforms.Even as the consumer pays a high price, the intermediaries/traders pass on only a fraction of it to the farmers. The solution lies in liberating the agri-markets from state controls and giving farmers more options to sell their produce. This can happen only if states bring about legislative reforms such as the abolition of the APMCs (agricultural produce marketing committees). Given that a majority of states are under BJP rule today, it should not be difficult for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to crack the whip.(The writer is a New Delhi-based policy analyst)"

Picture by Pradip SanyalPosta: Nearly 300,000 trucks across Bengal remained off the roads on Monday, marking the start of an indefinite strike against rising fuel price and third-party insurance premium.Supply of fish, vegetables and fruits could be hit, triggering a price rise, if the strike continues for another 48 hours, city wholesalers and retailers said on Monday.The supply of vegetables such as onions, chillies, cauliflower, cabbage and tomatoes is largely dependent on other states, including Maharashtra and Karnakataka, around this time of the year.The bulk of the supply reaches Calcutta in trucks. ""If a truck owner is left with Rs 3,000-4,000 at the end of a Calcutta-Mumbai-Calcutta trip, what's the point in plying trucks?"" Subhas Chandra Bose, secretary, Federation of West Bengal Truck Operators' Association, asked.""Fuel prices have gone up. Premium for third-party insurance has increased by Rs 13,000 to Rs 14,000... so has the salary of drivers and workers,"" he said. ""We will continue with the strike unless a solution is reached.""On Monday, rows of trucks remained parked across parts of Posta, Burrabazar, Dunlop, Sodepur, and along NH2 and Durgapur Expressway even as transport bosses tried to find a way to break the deadlock.Truck operators have been offered a chance to meet chief minister Mamata Banerjee, an official at Nabanna said.Some trucks plied across parts of Garden Reach and Metiabruz, though.""We hope the impasse ends soon,"" a transport official said. ""We have enough supplies. The truck operators had met the chief minister once when bus and taxi fares were being revised. They can meet her again to discuss the matter.""Apart from vegetables and fruits, the biggest concern is fish. The annual demand in Bengal is 1.9 million tonnes.Despite being among the top coastal states in fish production, Bengal has to depend on Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu for fish supplies.Calcutta needs 70-75 truckloads of rohu and katla from Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Odisha daily.""The consumption of fish has gone up following a slump in the meat market because of the rotten meat scare. If the supply is hit, we will face a huge problem,"" a fish dealer in Sealdah said.Truck operators said they had raised the matter of cops demanding bribes during their meetings with the government.

And food is an important part of it. So expect a thali, served on banana leaf, with more than 20 dishes.The staff will be staying over at the restaurant the previous night, in preparation. At 4am we shall bathe, don new dhoti-kurtas, pray and then cook, smiles K. Surendran Nair, the sweet 72-year-old Malayali head chef.Any auspicious occasion in Kerala is strictly vegetarian but you wont miss mutton as you dig into Aviyal (made of papaya, chal kumro, and coconut), Kootu Curry (made of channa, kachkolka, ol and carrots) and Pachadi (a tangy mixed vegetable curry).Since the meal is served on a banana leaf, most items are dry or have a thick gravy. Its just sambar, rassam and a Moong Dal preparation that are watery and will be served on the rice. The chef adds that the Moong Dal preparation is one of the toughest on his list. It uses jaggery and coconut milk and takes two hours to make, he says.Menons personal favourite is the tangy Mambazha mango curry, made of curd, coconut and chilli.The Rs 400 thali will be a lunch-only affair, as is the custom in the southern state, and prior reservations is a must. This part of town has many Malayalis working in the IT sector or studying in institutes like NUJS. They have been making bookings but for Onam we had more Bengalis.

We get ourselves some lebu cha or lemon tea. It is four o' clock in the morning and we are at Galiff Street in north Calcutta's Bagbazar area - the largest pet and plant market of Bengal.The street, according to the Kalikata Street Directory 1915, is named after one Mr Galiff, who was the Collector and Commissioner of Calcutta in 1824. Thereafter, it has been 60 years since the street changed name, but it is still referred to by the name of Galiff of the missing first name.Cold breeze from the Ganges, which flows parallel to the street, stings our faces that morning. Some people are still lying on the footpaths, ensconced in blankets. But the rest of the street is awake and stirring. The market, after all, comes alive once a week, on Sundays. It hosts vendors from all over the state. They start coming in from places such as Durgapur, Asansol, Midnapore - by the night train or bus the pre-vious night. Some arrive on lorries laden with wares.The chaiwala is perhaps not just a chaiwala. He lingers. And then, after a minute's small talk, asks if there is anything in particular that we are looking for. ""Birds, dogs,"" he asks. What about mongoose? Like the Wink Girl whose video is now going viral, his face registers a series of expressions. When he actually opens his mouth to speak again, he says - ""I don't know"" - but doesn't go away either.We order a second round of tea. As he pours it out in style from a height into the transparent plastic cups, it looks a liquid golden thread against the dark. He mutters a statutory warning, ""Police are patrolling the place. If they find such things here, they will seize them immediately."" Then, between furtive glances roadwards: ""You will get your mongoose. Go and check with the ones selling rats."" And before we know it, he has picked up his kettle and disappeared into the darkness.The rat-seller whom we needed to ask for the mongoose is fast asleep, so we decide to stroll around. One stretch is full of colour - dahlias, white, yellow, red and pink; shaggy chrysanthemums, dainty petunias, fifty shades of roses, long-necked Easter lilies, woolly-headed ball lilies, prickly cactuses peeping out of trunks... There are plants growing vegetables - cabbage, brinjal, tomato, cauliflower, green chillies... An undecipherable sweet smell hangs about. In places, however, it is overlapped by the pungent smell of weeds, worms and pesticides. One shop is selling what looks like ugly blobs on plastic sheets. Turns out to be suji poka or worms used in pisciculture.By now it past 5am. A father and son are selling boiled eggs - duck and hen - and generously buttered toast. We ask the man where we can find a mongoose. The response, however, comes from another. This person, too, is setting up shop, putting out to hang from a clothes line, fish and eels in small plastic packets half filled with water. ""You must ask the people who sell birds,"" he says and then abruptly turns his back on us.We pass a stack of empty aquariums, some of them are fancy and come with temperature control, we are told. These makeshift stalls are also selling pebbles used to decorate aquariums. There are seashells, barnacles, rocks.Suddenly the street is awash with soft orange light. Day is breaking in slow motion and heralding it is this mixed chorus of birds. The chirrups are emanating from tempos. One by one the cages are being off-loaded from these.A man is carrying a pole that is overhung with two giant cages segregated into compartments. And in these compartments are the chatterbox birds. Lovebirds, almost 20 of them, huddled together. A pair of cockatiels with proud powdered heads like French Dauphins. White pigeons - a rarity. Mynahs and some birds of the starling family.A young girl stands in one corner of the street with just one green parrot and several empty cages. She has come all the way from Jharkhand. She is saying in her singsong voice, "" Nau sau rup-iya, nau sau rupiya. Khaane seekh gayi hai, koi mehnat nahin hoga, bolti bhi hai."" She is selling the not-for-sale Indian parrot for Rs 900. She is vouching for its grooming - can feed on its own and speak in human tongue, too. And what can it say, we asked. She replies, ""Ram, Ram."" But of course. We keep moving. After all, we have to find the mongoose man.A few steps ahead of the girl, there is a cage with twin birds. They look like the parrot except for a blue patch throat down. The local name for it is neelmohun. ""It is rare,"" says the woman in a green sari, who is minding it.We come across other Indian bird varieties such as the bulbul, the plum-headed parakeet, the common mynah, Indian cuckoo, the Indian roller, spotted dove, kite, grey parrot, macaw, the Indian koel...The Wildlife Protection Act bans the trade and trapping of all indigenous birds, but on Galiff Street you will see Dickensian figures carrying one or more such birds in small netted bags and roaming the market to net buyers. These are, of course, the smaller birds. The bigger ones such as the macaw or grey parrot are available in the bigger shops on the street. Not that they have any better an arrangement. The birds, kept in small cardboard boxes to avoid police glare, often die of suffocation.""Do you sell the lokkhi pyacha,"" another difficult customer making queries. Lokkhi pyacha is the name for the white owl, so named because it is the goddess of wealth Lakshmi's vehicle, according to Hindu mythology. The woman selling the neelmohun does not bat an eyelid. ""Big or small,"" she asks, and then without waiting for a reply rattles on, ""The big ones come at Rs 12,000 a piece. The small ones cost Rs 6,000.""And where would these come from? There are shikaris or hunters who know these things, she changes the topic only to dig herself a deeper hole. ""We can order vultures and kites too,"" she says. They also arrange for home delivery of rare orders. Can we meet the hunters? Apparently we cannot unless an advance payment has been made.The neelmohun woman is from south Bengal's Sunderbans area. She travels for three-and-a-half hours every Sunday morning to sell her wares. There are also some others who come from Bongaon, in the North 24-Parganas. Can we ask the shikari to find us a mongoose? Suddenly, someone seems to have pushed the mute button on her. She points at a shop a few feet away; it is just starting to up its shutters.A middle-aged man is arranging his merchandise - white rats, guinea pigs, red-eyed rabbits. There is no sign of any mongoose. Does he not sell them? He smiles mysteriously and nods. He does not but he can help; it is available.You can also get a hamster. And tortoises, the star turtle or the red ear slider - these are usually kept on display in aquariums. All of it is contraband. And tortoise meat? What about the mongoose we have been chasing all morning? Can he get that or not? That annoying smile appears again. And he replies, ""Come a little later in the day and we shall see."""

But many dont know that the Holy Grail is located in the Valencia Cathedral of Spain and even the Vatican City, the religious capital of Christianity, has acknowledged it. The artifact stays well-protected in a bay on the wall and people offer their prayers here. Along with this, the Cathedral is famous for the preserved arm of St. Vincent of Saragossa. The place serves as a center of faith for many, and not everywhere you get to the see the Holy Grail.Bull FightingBull Fighting stays synonymous with Spain. All over the world, animal activists have been criticizing the act demanding to ban it, but Spain has no intention of letting go its traditional act. Bull Fighting takes place in all over the country and has been the very part of it for hundreds of years. Though it takes place in many parts of the country, the one being organized in Madrid is the best one, and Seville has the most authentic one sticking to the traditions.Flamenco ShowEvery country has some festivals that stay specific to its border, and out of many that take place in Spain, Flamenco Show is the one.

The scariest pathway is located in the small village of El Choro, Malaga, Spain. The one meter wide, the pathway is known as Caminito Del Rey and was inaugurated by Alfonso XIII. 3000 meters long and 101 meters tall, this one will surely send chills down to your spine while you cross it.La TomatinaThis one needs no elaboration. La Tomatina is a festival that receives the maximum number of tourists from all over the world and it takes place in Bunol, a small town. People throw tomatoes on each other and enjoy to the fullest by dancing, eating, and drinking.These are some of those experiences that you will only experience in Spain and it will certainly fill you with happiness."

However, Trump could decide to exempt some countries from any measures, including its NAFTA trading partners and has indicated he might exempt Canada.A Mexican official said the Ross meeting would address Mexican concerns over trade in steel and tomatoes, noting that Mexico would retaliate against steel tariffs.Ross has said he would not be surprised to see countries challenge any steel tariffs at the World Trade Organization.There are concerns that stiff U.S. tariffs could raise global steel prices, which would impact Mexico. While Mexico is a large steel importer, it also exported approximately 4.5 million tonnes in 2016.'HARD TO ACHIEVE'Meanwhile in Mexico City, negotiators discussed the broad outlines of so-called rules of origin, which would have a big impact on the automotive industry.Talks were hampered by the absence of the chief U.S. negotiator, Jason Bernstein, who was unexpectedly called to Washington on Tuesday for consultations and is unlikely to return to Mexico.The possible delay in tackling the matter underlines the slow progress of the talks, which are supposed to wrap up by early April, but look set to drag on for longer.The current round of talks will also focus on closing chapters related to digital trade, telecommunications, technical barriers to trade, good regulatory practices, and sanitary and phytosanitary measures, according to an official with knowledge of the talks.Steve Verheul, Canada's chief negotiator in the NAFTA talks, reported some advances in Mexico City.""We're making reasonably good progress so far,"" he told journalists without elaborating.NAFTA talks have crawled along for the past six months, and Trump has threatened to walk away from the $1.2 trillion treaty unless major changes are made to benefit American interests."

We are looking at compressing the supply chains and creating appropriate climate infrastructure for natural preservation of TOP,"" Badal said.A sum of Rs 500 crore has been earmarked for this scheme.Farmers Producers Organisations (FPOs), agri-logistics processing facilities and professional management will be encouraged under this scheme, she added.Food Processing Secretary J P Meena said the key features of the scheme will mostly likely be ready by April.The vegetable clusters are already mapped in the country and need to work out backward and forward linkages for FPOs keen to take advantage of the scheme, he added.The 'Operation Greens' is similar to the 'Operation Flood' launched in 1966 which was the world's biggest dairy development program of the government."

However the peasantry, which has suffered heavily due to successive droughts and farm commodity price crash in the state, feels let down as the Budget has no initiative to offer relief from the debt burden.Kuruburu Shanthakumar, president of State Farmers Federation, had expected categorical commitment from the Modi government on implementing the Swaminathan Committee report, which Modi had promised to implement within 100 days of coming to power. However, he welcomed the Budget proposal to raise the minimum support price (MSP) of agricultural commodities to 1.5 times the production cost.The proposal is also to extend the MSP scheme to all the 89 crops. It was earlier restricted to 43. He also welcome Kisan credit cards extension to all farmers.Shanthakumar told The New Indian Express that declaring 100 per cent tax exemption for five years for farm produce firms being formed by the farmers is a positive move.Though the Budget has assured huge expansion of crop insurance scheme under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, the scheme itself suffers from many flaws. It needs to be revamped by making a village or farmers the basic unit of reference to pay the compensation instead of the present basic unit of a hobli or gram panchayat.I will give this budget 5 marks on a scale of 10 for the farm sector and will ramp it up to 7 if effective measures are taken to implement the proposals in the remaining one of the Modi government, Shantakumar said.On allocating Rs 500 crore for farmers who grow perishable commodities like potato, tomato and onion, horticulture expert S V Hittalamani said in Karnataka there are some saline agriculture belt which cannot be used for agriculture purposes.However, agriculture experts feel the budget does not help farmers. Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha president Kodihalli Chandrashekar said the budget outlay for agri sector is Rs 11,000 crore. How much of it actually goes to farmers? Whatever money is announced is for the seeds, fertiliser, manure and other facilities. Budget does not speak about loan waiver, he said.He further added that if the Centre can bear Rs 2 lakh crore to implement the 7th pay commission report, why cannot they waive the loan of farmers who are the backbone of the nation."

Initially, AP was synonymous with drought and cyclones. Continuous efforts in the last four years have showcased our resources and strength in various fields and now I am sure the State will register more progress with team spirit, he said, while underscoring the need for more coordination between officials and employees.On the second and final day of the Collectors Conference at his residence in Undavalli on Wednesday, the Chief Minister surprised the officials by describing himself as a team leader and coordinator. Stating that AP has put up a phenomenal performance and displayed excellent leadership, he said the credit for the achievements of the State goes to all.After overcoming all odds initially, we are entering the next level and it is time for all of us to work with more coordination, he said.Explaining about his conversation with former British prime minister Tony Blair as well as the prominent architect Norman Foster, he said on Monday Foster landed in Vijayawada to have a chat with him, while he was en route to Odisha. But, as I am preoccupied with a series of conferences like the Finance Ministers conclave, review meetings and the rally condemning the brutal assaults on girls and women, I could not meet him. After understanding that he could not meet me despite landing here on my own request, Foster decided to go to Odisha. But, after receiving proper information, I not only met him but also dropped him at the airport and had a conversation with him, he said.Naidu said he does not have any individual relationship with Foster. I met him as he is a great architect. In case I did not meet him personally, it would have sent a negative signal about our State at a time when we are in need of support of world-class architects for building Amaravati as one of the worlds best cities, he said.CS makes critical observationChief Secretary Dinesh Kumar pointed out that there will be no use except forcing the closure of the existing industries by allowing more cashew processing industries in Srikakulam district. When Srikakulam District Collector Dhanunjay Reddy sought more cashew processing units, the Chief Secretary said excess processing units are not needed for cashew.Industries Minister N Amarnath Reddy intervened and said that setting up of more processing units will generate employment. But, the Chief Secretary said that more units than the cashew production capacity will only force closure of the existing units.We can understand that there is immediate need for setting up processing units for tomato as the growers in Chittoor district are suffering losses. But, setting up more units for cashew is no way needed, the Chief Secretary said.

Though, some leaders feel it is premature to discuss alliances as there is one more year for elections, others opine that it is better for the TDP to prepare to fight alone. At present, the principal opposition YSRC and the BJP have turned bitter rivals of the TDP. Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan, who stood by the TDP-BJP alliance in 2014 polls, too, is targeting the ruling party and Left parties blame the Naidu government for being equally responsible along with the saffron party for the injustice meted out to the State. Despite Chandrababu Naidus recent meeting with the national leaders of Left parties in Bengaluru, TDP leaders are not sure whether any alliance with CPI and CPM will benefit it or not and they are also not sure on their stand on alliance as they are already sailing with Jana Sena.Against this backdrop, TDP leaders are of the view that they should be prepared to face elections alone instead of depending on alliances. In a brief interaction with TNIE at the venue of Mahanadu, several senior leaders opined that despite the fact that satisfaction levels among people have increased and the CM is confident of retaining power, they will have to be very cautious as there is possibility of all the opposition parties targeting the TDP.A senior leader said the TDPs decision to snap ties with the BJP and leave the NDA government at the Centre helped the party in shifting the blame for States woes to the Centre. If we continued our relations with the saffron party till elections, we may have suffered a lot in the upcoming elections. But, now, by organising a series of programmes, we are hopeful that the people will not bear no more grudge against the State government and, instead, find the BJP and the opposition parties, which are dancing to the tunes of the Centre, as villains, a senior leader said.A leader from North Coastal Andhra explained that at one stage opposition parties managed to convince the people about the guilt of the ruling party in not achieving special category status (SCS) in spite of being an ally of the NDA, by making a big issue out of it. But, after the TDP made the SCS as its main demand and left the NDA, they to some extent understood the TDPs position and its sincere efforts. We are hopeful the people will stand by us without being carried away by the rants of opposition parties. Minister Kalava Srinivasulu said at present the party was concentrating on strengthening its position in the State and will think of political tie-ups only before elections.Mahanadu SidelightsAccording to the 2017-18 fiscal status report of the TDP, which was submitted by party state treasurer and MLA Sidda Raghava Rao, the party has properties with a net worth of J104.15 crore. Its net income in the previous fiscal was J19.40 crore, while the expenditure stood at J16.73 crore. Of the total expenditure, J6.38 crore was spent on publicity, Raghava Rao said. It maybe recalled that a report published by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), last week, said that TDP had the second highest income (in 2016-17 fiscal) among the regional parties after Samajwadi Party. According the the report, TDPs 2016-17 income was J72.9 crore.Heavy traffic jam was witnessed between Benz Circle and VR Siddhartha Engineering College in Kanuru between 9.30 am and 11 am. Even though city police and TDP volunteers were deployed, thousands of vehicles ferrying TDP workers to the venue of Mahanadu sent the traffic for a toss. Beside, indiscriminate parking of two-wheelers and four-wheelers on the road added to the chaos.The first-ever Mahanadu, an idea conceived and implemented by TDP founder the late N T Rama Rao, was held in Vijayawada in 1983 in the 200 acres where Kamineni Nagar, Ganesh Colony, Sri Ramachandra Colony and others have come up now. Mahanadu Road opposite Dr NTR University of Health Sciences, leading to Autonagar has got its name after it was laid to facilitate the movement of vehicles for the first TDP conclave. Two more conclaves were held in the subsequent years. The Mahanadu, which kicked off on Sunday, is the first one since the State bifurcation.Ravva kesari, idly, mysore bonda, tomato bath, tea and coffee were served to the party workers as breakfastw. For lunch, about 20 varieties including apple halwa, Madras pakodi, vegetable biryani, kadai vegetable curry, dondakaya fry, mamidiyaka-aakura pappu, mulakaya-tomato curry, stuffed brinjal were spread out. At 3 pm, snacks were also given. On Monday, which also marks the birthday anniversary of TDP founder NTR, more than 20 varieties of food times, favourites of the late leader, will be served at the venue, according to TDP leaders.The party has put up the model of interlinking of Krishna and Godavari rivers through Pattiseema Lift Irrigation Project at the dais of the venue. The previous Mahanadu held in Visakhapatnam had the models of Polavaram project and Cyber Towers on either side of the dais.Speaking about elections, Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu stressed the need for studying Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs). Technology is always vulnerable to defects. Since we vote only once in five years, we dont have much knowledge of how EVMs work. So, there is a need to create awareness, he said and recalled that he was instrumental in ensuring Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) system along with EVMs.At the blood donation camp, close to 220 TDP workers donated blood. Meanwhile, TDP MP Murali Mohan and K Raghu Ramakrishnam Raju donated Rs 5 lakhs and Rs 20 lakhs respectively for the party welfare."

Last week, forecasts ran as high as $150 million for the four-day haul of ""Solo.""Overseas ticket sales were even worse. ""Solo,"" starring Alden Ehrenreich in the role made iconic by Harrison Ford, grossed $65 million internationally in its opening weekend, including a paltry $10.1 million in China.""Of course we would have hoped for this to be a bit bigger,"" said Dave Hollis, Disney's distribution chief. ""We're encouraged by the response that people have had to the film. It got a good CinemaScore (A-minus). The exits are very encouraging.""""Solo"" came in with a Millennium Falcon's worth of baggage following the mid-production firing of directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who were replaced by Ron Howard. With the rejiggered production, the budget soared well past $250 million.But the cause of the spinoff's disappointing performance may have had as much to do with ""Star Wars"" fatigue (""The Last Jedi"" exited theaters just last month) and the stiffer competition of a summer holiday weekend. While no major releases dared to open against ""Solo,"" Fox's ""Deadpool 2"" moved its release date up a week ahead of ""Solo.""The gambit may have hurt both releases. After debuting with $125 million last weekend, the R-rated Ryan Reynolds sequel dropped 66 percent to second place with $42.7 million and an estimated $53.5 million four-day haul.""Solo"" notched the biggest Memorial Day weekend opening in several years, but it also came on the heels of a pair of a summer-sized blockbusters  ""Deadpool 2"" and Disney's own ""Avengers Infinity War""  making for an unusually crowded May. ""Infinity War"" added $16.5 million in its fifth weekend to bring its domestic total to $621.7 million and its global sales to $1.9 billion  both among the highest of all-time.""It is a business that is built on momentum but also one where people probably are only able to get to theaters a certain number of weeks in a row,"" said Hollis.But there were also questions beyond the effect the calendar had on ""Solo."" While reviews were generally positive (71 percent ""fresh"" on Rotten Tomatoes), there was little about ""Solo"" that made the movie a must-see event.Fans were skeptical of Ehrenreich and uncertain about the dismissal of Lord and Miller (the popular filmmaking duo behind ""21 Jump Street"" and ""The Lego Movie""). Unlike any ""Star Wars"" release before, ""Solo"" was deemed  gasp  skippable.As it arrived in theaters, Disney might have been wishing it had instead made a Lando Calrissian spinoff with the red-hot Donald Glover, the star of TV's ""Atlanta."" In the days ahead of release, Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy said a Lando movie is a possibility.While the original ""Star Wars"" films helped define the summer moviegoing experience, Disney released their previous three ""Star Wars"" films in December. What most hurt ""Solo"" was the ""fatigue factor"" of a May ""Star Wars"" film following a December one, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for comScore.""It's the compressed timeframe between the two 'Star Wars' films and the highly competitive nature of this marketplace. It is summer, after all,"" said Dergarabedian. ""The good news is that the next film isn't until December 2019. That's plenty of breathing space. I think part of the allure of the 'Star Wars' brand in the past has been the long wait.""That time might also be valuable for Lucasfilm and Disney to find a way to counter the diminishing returns of its multi-billion-dollar franchise. To help propel ""Solo"" internationally, Disney brought the film to Cannes Film Festival, flooding the French film festival's red carpet with Storm Troopers.""The Last Jedi"" also flopped in China (it was pulled from theaters after a week), and Rian Johnson's movie  even though it grossed $1.3 billion worldwide  showed relatively weak legs at the box office, while proving divisive among ""Star Wars"" die-hards.The magic around a ""Star Wars"" film may be fading. To right the ship on Episode 9, Lucasfilm has turned to an old friend: ""The Force Awakens"" director J.J. Abrams. He, too, is replacing a fired director after Colin Trevorrow departed last fall.Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to comScore.

I leased a unit and processed fruit. In spite of the initial loss suffered due to lack of quality consciousness among the stakeholders, I went ahead with export.

I have requested assistance from the Government of India for the same,"" he said in a representation made to the Union Minister.To ensure that cooperatives are able to function effectively, the chief minister demanded for increase in the quantum of concessional refinance which National Bank For Agriculture And Rural Development (NABARD) provides from the current 40 per cent to 75 per cent of the ground level disbursement.""This will help us to provide timely and needy credit to small and marginal farmers,"" he said.To ensure farmers get credit at lower rate, the chief minister said that the government should raise the subsidy from 2 per cent to 3 per cent on crop loans for cooperatives.With regard to minimum support price (MSP) of crops, Mr Kumaraswamy asked the Centre to consider C2+FL formula while fixing the price instead of current A2+FL formula.He also suggested the central government to fix MSP for horticultural crops like tomato, onion and potato.Among other demands, the chief minister demanded the Centre to give a special financial package of Rs 2,477.26 crore for losses incurred by arecanut and coconut growers in the state.Coconut has been affected in 1.37 lakh hectare and arecanut in 95,352 hectare and the total loss is pegged at Rs 9,909.6 crore in the state, he added.""The state has prioritised farmer welfare in all its programmes and simultaneously initiated concerted efforts to achieve the goal of doubling farmers income by 2022,"" the chief minister informed in the meeting.The state has been perennially affected by drought with six out of last eight years being declared as drought years and farmers have endured adverse effect of severe successive droughts, he added."

(File)Blaming the previous governments for the state of the pilgrim city, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said he wanted to see it developed as a place with an ancient soul but in a modern shell.Addressing a public rally in Varanasi in his Lok Sabha constituency, he said change was visible in Varanasi over the last four years of his government.PM Modi urged the people of Varanasi to start preparing to welcome delegates from all over the world for the Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas (NRI Day), which will be held here from January 21 to 23 next year.The guests will also visit Allahabad for a 'kumbh darshan'.Earlier in the day, the prime minister had addressed another rally in Azamgarh and laid the foundation stone there for the 340-km Purvanchal Expressway.He will visit Mirzapur on Sunday, wrapping up his two-day visit to eastern Uttar Pradesh.In a symbolic inauguration in Varanasi, PM Modi launched development projects worth nearly Rs 1,000 crore for the city and the region around it. ""A new Banaras is being built for a new India; its soul will remain ancient but the structure will be new,"" he said.While its culture and traditions will remain, the city will have ""smart systems."" He began his speech in the local dialect and chanted 'Har Har Mahadev'.PM Modi condoled the death of at least 15 people when an under-construction flyover collapsed here in May.He said the city was in neglect when the Samajwadi Party was in power in Uttar Pradesh.""Four years back there were overflowing sewers, dangling cables, and traffic jams all over. The road from the airport was in a bad state due to which flights were missed,"" he said.PM Modi said the situation had changed now with cooperation between the BJP governments in the state and at the Centre.""The condition of the Ganga banks was also not good and all the waste used to flow into the river. The earlier governments were not concerned about this,"" he said.He said a large amount of money was earlier wasted in the name of cleaning up the river. The BJP-led government has now taken up the task of cleaning the Ganga from Gangotri to Gangasagar, and sanctioned Rs 21,000 crore for this.He said projects related to roads, transport, cooking gas, beautification, cleanliness and other schemes to help people living here were inaugurated today.""The change Varanasi is witnessing is helping nearby areas and villages. For the farmers, a perishable cargo centre is ready and potatoes, tomatoes and other perishable vegetables can be stored here. Farmers will not have to suffer losses,"" he said.""Whether it is roads or railways, new facilities are being made available for Varanasi. Doubling of track to Allahabad and Chhapra is on,"" he said.New trains will help people from Ballia and Ghazipur to come to Varanasi and return the same day, he added.He praised the Yogi Adityanath government in the state.""Tourism promotion and work on cleanliness and conservation of old monuments are being acknowledged. Swachh Bharat campaign has been taken forward by the UP government,"" he said.He said that impact of the state's industrial policy was also visible now.""The Samsung factory in Nodia was recently inaugurated by me. It will generate job opportunities. Mobile phone factories have increased from two to 120 in the past four years, of these over 50 are in UP,"" he said."

Larry Charles (@larrycharlesism) July 11, 2018The speed with which an ongoing tragedy has been mined for intellectual property, as if it were an old Marvel comic book, might seem distasteful. But it isn't a particularly new phenomenon.- - -""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""The Hurt Locker""One of the most striking recent examples is ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" Kathryn Bigelow's dramatization of United States government's hunt for and eventual killing of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. U.S. forces killed bin Laden on May 2, 2011, in what President Barack Obama called ""the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat al-Qaida."" The movie hit theaters in December 2012, barely a year and a half later.That's a remarkable turnaround time. Bigelow, though, was no stranger to tackling fresh issues. She won six Oscars, including best director and best picture, for her 2008 movie ""The Hurt Locker,"" which followed a U.S. bomb disposal team during the Iraq War. Though the movie was based on accounts of a journalist embedded in Iraq in 2004, it came out while the Iraq War was still underway.""Patriots Day"" and ""Stronger""The 2013 Boston marathon bombing, which killed three and injured hundreds more, was turned into two major, star-driven films.First came ""Patriots Day"" in 2016. The Peter Berg movie depicts Mark Wahlberg as Boston Police Sgt. Tommy Saunders as he searches for the bombers in the attack's immediate aftermath.Though movies based on recent tragedies are often subject to backlash, the reaction to ""Patriots Day"" was particularly fierce - especially in the Boston area. The movie, wrote Boston film critic Sean Burns, was ""as disgraceful an exploitation of real-life tragedy as I've ever seen. Everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves.""The Boston Globe's Ty Burr was slightly more forgiving, calling it ""slickly heartfelt"" and ""vaguely insulting.""A year later, ""Stronger"" hit theaters. Rather than focus on the police response, the David Gordon Green told the story of Jeff Bauman (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), a man who lost his legs in the bombing and was the subject of a famous photo from the day.This one was much more warmly received, perhaps because it was based on Bauman's memoir. It ""rises on the power of its well-chosen ensemble to offer an emotionally resonant fact-based story that transcends inspirational drama cliches,"" reads the critical consensus on Rotten Tomatoes, where it earned a 92 percent ""fresh"" rating.""United 93 and ""World Trade Center""The September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the United States was, by far, the country's deadliest. Perhaps due to this wretched gravity, Hollywood waited a bit longer to cash in on the horror. But cash in it did, with a pair of back-to-back movies. ""United 93 and ""World Trade Center"" were both released in 2006, within four months of each other.The first came in April, and as the title suggests, told the story of United 93 - the hijacked plane heading toward Washington, D.C., that crashed in Pennsylvania after its passengers attacked the hijackers. Paul Greengrass' account was met warmly by critics, but those connected to the actual event weren't as pleased.""It was both excruciating and beautiful at the same time,"" Alice Hoagland, whose son was on the flight, told the San Francisco Chronicle. After Marjorie Kase, who lost three friends in the 9/11 attacks, unexpectedly saw a trailer, she echoed others in telling the paper, ""I don't think the country is ready for this movie right now. We don't have enough perspective or hindsight on the matter.""Just as ""United 93 was coming out on DVD months later, Oliver Stone's account of first responders was hitting theaters amid far more mixed reviews - many of which deemed it exploitative.The World Trade Center attacks are still being mined for the big screen. ""9/11,"" starring Charlie Sheen and Whoopi Goldberg, came out just last year.With each release, it seems, those directly affected by attacks are forced to relieve the horrid day. Bill Doyle, whose son was killed in the Twin Towers, was particularly angry after seeing advertisements for 2012's ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,"" the Tom Hanks vehicle based on a Jonathan Safran Foer novel.""Everybody's trying to make money off 9/11,"" he told the New York Post. ""A lot of families got upset. Why couldn't they warn us about this? I don't think people really realized that these people are really still stressed.""""American Sniper""A year after Chris Kyle -- the deadliest marksman in United States history who had 255 confirmed kills during four tours in Iraq -- died in 2013, the Oscar-winning, Clint Eastwood-helmed depiction of his life (and death) titled ""American Sniper"" hit theaters.Made-for-TV moviesThe timeline also tends to be even shorter when it comes to the made-for-TV movies. Consider this: In May 1993, Tim Daly portrayed David Koresh in a small screen flick about the standoff between the police and the Branch Davidians - which occurred less than a month earlier."
5b540c319855b710b170da6e,A Town  Revered For Its Hams Is Losing A Slice Of History,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/smithfield-a-town-revered-for-its-hams-is-losing-a-slice-of-history-1887511,2018-07-22,,NDTV,"Salted hams are curing in the smokehouse at Darden's Country Store in Isle of Wight County, Virginia.The local charity run is the Hog Jog. The mascot for the wine festival is Pig-o-noir. October brings the Bacon & Bourbon Fest. The town museum promises the ""World's Oldest Ham."" The rescue truck at the volunteer fire department is named ""Hamtown Heavy.""You could say Smithfield is a little obsessed with pork products, but that would understate how deeply hogs are woven into the history and life of this town of about 8,300 on a hill over the Pagan River. So it has come as a shock that Smithfield Foods is shuttering the last smokehouse that produces the area's signature product, the genuine Smithfield ham.""Really? You're going to do this?"" was the reaction of local historian and former Smithfield Foods executive Herb De Groft, 77. ""Country meats are what brought this area to the fore in the 1800s. Word was, the Queen of England used to get one Smithfield ham a year.""The salty, long-cured ham has been an area staple since the English colonists and their hogs arrived at nearby Jamestown in the early 1600s. There is a whole section of Virginia State Code - Title 3.2, Chapter 54, Article 4 - entitled ""Smithfield Hams."" Just as the French define Champagne and the European Union protects Greek Feta cheese, Virginia law dictates that genuine Smithfield ham is cured in Smithfield.Jennifer England stands next to a case of antique hams at the Isle of Wight County Museum.""Anybody can make a ham,"" said Jennifer England, director of the local museum, where pig fanciers can keep tabs on a ham cured in 1902 via the online ""Ham Cam."" ""But a Smithfield ham can only come from within the town itself.""The company has said little about its plans since the Smithfield Times newspaper broke the story about the smokehouse last month. A Smithfield Foods spokeswoman said that the smokehouse had reached the end of its useful life and that the company has plenty of genuine Smithfield hams stockpiled to satisfy immediate demand.""We're currently meeting about the future of the smokehouse and I don't have many details to share at this point. Should know more in the coming weeks,"" spokeswoman Diana Souder said via email.The smokehouse is said to be more than 50 years old, but whether the company will build a new one, seek a change in state law or simply abandon the ""genuine Smithfield"" moniker is a matter of local speculation.Smokehouses once sat cheek by jowl, so to speak, in the little town, but local ham producers have been consolidating for years. Names like Gwaltney, Luter and Todd - a roll call that can make an old Virginian's mouth start to water - were absorbed into the giant Smithfield Foods, which itself was purchased five years ago by the Chinese conglomerate Shuanghui Group, now known as WH Group.An outsider might think selling out to a foreign company would be the thing that set off local alarm bells. But the headquarters remained in a beautiful riverfront complex, the executives are all American, and Smithfield Foods stepped up its involvement in local charities and community events.""Hey, selling to a Chinese company was a very smart move,"" said De Groft, who retired from Smithfield Foods more than 20 years ago. China, he pointed out, is the world's biggest market for pork products.The huge meatpacking plants on the edge of town slaughter more than 10,000 hogs per day. On a hot summer afternoon, the sickly sweet smell of the plants settles on the little downtown, where the most modern houses are Victorian confections and some buildings have been absorbing hog aroma since before the Revolution.""They say that's the smell of money,"" said Caroline Darden Hurt, 75, a retired history teacher whose family has farmed in the area since the 1600s.There is plenty of ham still coming from Smithfield Foods, the world's biggest pork producer. Some of it is even salty - Virginia ham and country ham are generic types produced by many companies. But they are not genuine Smithfield hams.A Smithfield ham is long-cut, with loin attached. Most country hams are short-cut. Old-timers will tell you the curing process - high in the smokehouse rafters over a long, sweltering summer - creates particular amino acids and salt deposits as the moisture disappears from the meat.But it's more than that. It is history and culture in food form. The first English settlers salted hams to preserve them; the Native Americans showed them how to smoke meats. A Smithfield ham is the result of both. Paired with a biscuit, served with Brunswick stew or peanut soup, finished with chocolate chess pie - that's southside Virginia, the sandy soil, the pine trees, the hot, flat peanut fields.Hurt, the retired history teacher, remembers people sharing hams on Sundays. ""Growing up, you could always tell one farmer's ham from another's. There were subtle differences. A ham cured in Suffolk or somewhere else just doesn't taste the same,"" she said.Originally, a hog destined for a Smithfield ham was turned loose on harvested peanut fields to glean the remainders. The peanut oils infused the meat. As hog farming grew in scale in the mid-20th century, though, the requirement that Smithfield hams be peanut-fed was removed from state law.Creating a Smithfield ham takes commitment. The cut hams are coated in salt and left to cure for more than a month; hung in a smokehouse and smoked for up to a week, until the color looks right; then left to hang and age for six months or more.Cooking a Smithfield ham is a ritual of its own, often caught up with Thanksgiving or Christmas memories, the salty meat soaking for a day or more before being washed and cooked and sliced tissue-thin.""The tourists come in looking for it specifically,"" said Leigh Abbott, general manager of the Smithfield Inn, which dates to 1752. ""I think the locals get a little tapped out on it. Though bacon unites everybody.""Across the street from the inn, a genuine Smithfield ham can cost from $150 to $200 at the Taste of Smithfield restaurant and store.Some old-fashioned producers remain in the surrounding countryside. Edwards hams are well-known in nearby Surry County, though a smokehouse fire caused a shortage a few years ago. Felts hams are big in Southampton County.Just outside Smithfield, at a crossroads among the cotton fields of Isle of Wight County, Tommy Darden carries on the tradition at his Darden's Country Store.""My daddy, he [cured hams] most all his life,"" Darden, 71, said. He and his wife keep a smokehouse across the street. They buy fresh-cut hams from Smithfield foods then cure and smoke them by hand.Though he can't, by law, call them genuine Smithfield hams, that's essentially what Darden makes. The short-cut variety that passes for country ham, he said, just can't compare.He's worried about the last smokehouse in town closing.""We're really not sure what that's going to entail, but we think it's not going to be good,"" he said. ""It's something that made them famous, something that put them on the map, something that everybody knows and relates to them with, and it's not going to be here.""Darden has 950 hams hanging in his smokehouse. He salted them in February, hung them in mid-March. They dangle from the dark rafters like props in a Renaissance painting, the surfaces rough with salt, the air pungent and rich. They were ready to cut down and cook on the Fourth of July.With a basket of tomatoes and a basket of ham biscuits on the counter of his shop, Darden said he will never get tired of the salty meat.""I like to eat a chicken salad sandwich with a slice of ham on it and tomato,"" he said. ""To me, that's absolute good."""

As a result, farmers are not getting the desired price for the produce,"" Mistry had said.Mistry further said he had told farmers in the past that the BJP government lacked vision.""Suigam is just 125 kms away from Idar. If you open the border at Suigam, farmers can export many commodities to Pakistan. It will increase trade and eventually benefit farmers of Banaskantha, Sabarkantha and Patan,"" he had said.Responding to Vaghani's barb at Mistry, Gujarat Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi Monday said the BJP leader should first clear his party's stand on the ""invitation extended by the Gujarat government to Pakistan for the upcoming Vibrant Gujarat Summit"".""BJP leaders had promised to teach a lesson to Pakistan ahead of 2014 Lok Sabha polls. But now, their government is spreading a red carpet for Pakistan. The BJP should first explain this sudden change.

Of the targeted 1.34 lakh hectares, only 90,000 hectares went for groundnut sowing during the Khariff season, of which less than 40,000 hectares saw harvesting. For the ongoing Rabi crop, the groundnut acreage dipped by about 80%.Paddy too fared badly, with even the eastern mandals that are known for their success stories doing poorly this year due to a prolonged dry spell. Though the target was set at 42,000 hectares in the eastern mandals, the acreage plummeted to half, with low yields.Sugarcane farming received a big jolt in the district due to adverse climate. Generally, the district used to have sugarcane farming in about one lakh hectares, but in 2018 it slipped to below 20,000 hectares. With closure of two cooperative sugar factories and non-remunerative prices for the tonnage, a majority of the farmers resorted to growing alternate crops.Tomato fares betterThe tomato sector fared slightly better, with profits being reported in August and September which took the pressure off an otherwise bleak year that saw yields staying low. During peak season, the Madanapalle tomato market yard receives stocks to the tune of 1,200 metric tonnes per day, with transactions crossing over Rs. 1.5 crore a day. However, the daily arrivals fell below 250 tonnes a day this year.Host of issuesOther predominant issues faced by the farmers this year were an unprecedented shortage of farm workers and a failure of alternative and intercrops. Some small-scale farmers reportedly took up NREGA works and temporarily migrated to Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to make a living as workers in the construction industry.Joint Director of Agriculture Vijay Kumar admitted that the year was disappointing. The major problem was the minus 48% deficit rainfall in the district. However, we are happy that farmers slowly switched over to natural farming. We have reached a target of 1.59 lakh hectares in acreage. As the declaration of drought mandals took place early in June and July, it helped several farmers stay away from their fields or going in for alternative crops, he said."

While speaking during the one-day winter session of Haryana assembly, the CM also announced to include raw potato in the Bhavantar Bharpai Yojana (price difference compensation scheme) from Friday onward.With the announcement of hike of Rs 10 per quintal in the sugarcane prices on Thursday, Haryana has become the first state in the country to increase state advisory price (SAP) for the crop this year as none of the other states had done that so far. Haryana is giving highest price in the country of sugarcane to the growers, the CM claimed.Khattar said that girdawari was being conducted in the state to assess the damage to crop due to hailstorm in different parts of Haryana this month. Compensation on account of damage to crop due to fire had been distributed by the respective deputy commissioners. Letters have been written to all the DCs directing them to give details of the remaining such cases so that compensation could be disbursed to those left out, he added.To remove shortcomings in the girdawari conducted manually by the department concerned and enhance accuracy to assess the damage to crops due to water logging, rain, and hailstorms, it had now been decided to set up an online portal, Khattar said. A farmer would have to give details concerning his crop and area under cultivation on this portal, which would be double checked by agriculture and farmers welfare department and revenue department so that he did not face any problem while getting claims from insurance companies and banks, the CM said.While referring to the Bhavantar Bharpai Yojana, the chief minister said that potato, tomato, cauliflower and onion were now being covered. If any farmers got price less than the minimum support price for these crops, the state government would cover the price deficit for farmers, he said, adding that 18,000 farmers cultivating 48,000 acres had so far register themselves. He said that besides the government and the concerned departments, it was also the duty of MLAs, even of the opposition parties, to make the farmers aware in their respective areas of these schemes so that maximum people could benefit.Soft loans from cooperative banks were being provided to farmers on 0% interest rate, the CM said. Apart from this, compensation amounting to about Rs 890 crore had been distributed to farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojanaduring the last three years in Haryana, of which Rs 229 crore had been given to farmers of Sirsa alone."

The apology came hours after Mahila Congress workers hurled eggs and tomatoes at his residence even as BJPs Mahila Morcha took out a candle march, demanding his resignation.I regret if my remark hurt anyone. My intention was not to hurt the victims family, who belonged to my constituency (Pipili), Maharathy said a couple of days after he had welcomed a local courts decision to acquit brothers Prashant and Sukant Pradhan for want of evidence and said truth has prevailed.Sources said with Lok Sabha and assembly elections round the corner, Maharathys comment could have put the BJD and the state government in a difficult situation, and hence he tendered the apology.It must be mentioned that Maharathy had earlier reportedly tried to shield the rape accused and it is believed the episode had played a role in his removal as agriculture minister in January 2012.Livid at Maharathy backing the acquittal, hundreds of Mahila Congress workers staged a demonstration in front of his residence near Lower PMG here. The agitators tried to barge into the ministers house, leading to a scuffle with the police. The protesters then threw eggs and tomatoes at his residence.In fact, Maharathys apology could not calm Mahila Congress workers, who demanded his resignation. We want his resignation, not an apology. He made a mockery of the victim by welcoming the acquittal of the two rapists, state Mahila Congress president Sumitra Jena said. Bureaucrat-turned-politician Aparajita Sarangi of the BJP said Maharathy should step down for hurting the sentiments of the people with his irresponsible remark. It is surprising that the state government talks of womens empowerment and 33 per cent reservation for women in assemblies and Parliament, but its cabinet minister makes such insensitive comment, Sarangi said.A delegation of BJP Mahila Morcha also visited the victims village and met her family members. We had earlier raised doubt regarding the Crime Branch probe and demanded a CBI inquiry. The acquittal of the accused exposed the sloppy investigation by the state agency. Since the accused are now free, our lives are in danger, the rape victims mother said.Additional director general of police (Crime Branch), Santosh Upadhyay, said the probe agency has initiated the process to challenge the acquittal in the high court. We have asked the director (prosecution) to move the Orissa high court, challenging the acquittal, Upadhyay said."

Many of the students, it added, were left traumatized.The Post launched a database in April tracking incidents of gun violence on campuses since 1999. It found that in 2018, there were 25 cases of school shooting nationwide; a total of 25,332 students were exposed to such carnage; 94 students were shot, among whom 33 were killed and 61 were injured.The 2018 figures in all the above statistics categories set new records in almost two decades. US campuses, as a result, witnessed the most serious devastation brought by gun violence.School systems in every US state and the District of Columbia -- irrespective of demographics or affluence, location or security -- had several lockdowns in the last school year, which ran from the autumn of 2017 to the summer of 2018, the report said.""In fact, on every school day between Labour Day in September 2017 and Memorial Day in May 2018, a campus in this country went into lockdown because of a shooting or the perceived danger of one,"" it said.On February 23, 2018 alone, 33 incidents were reported on campuses all around the country, triggering 67 lockdowns and affecting 50,427 students, a chart in the report illustrated.Children affected by lockdowns during the last school year covered all age groups. More than 1 million elementary-age kids were witnesses of an incident, of whom at least 220,000 are kindergarteners or younger ones, meaning they were mostly under 7 years of age.Experts on childhood trauma said they believe ""a meaningful percentage of"" the affected kids will sustain long-term consequences, including worsening academic and social progression, depression, anxiety, poor sleep, post-traumatic symptomatology and substance abuse.Regardless of how small an imminent threat is, it could be very challenging for school administrators in that they have to respond to the situation in a matter of seconds, the Post said."

You may actually be getting home a lot more than what you had bargained for. A variety of vegetables sold in markets of Hyderabad are laced with harmful chemical pesticides and can pose serious health hazards. At times, the toxic content even exceeds maximum permissible limits.Analysis of vegetable samples in the last one year by the National Institute of Plant Health Management (NIPHM), Hyderabad, revealed that many samples contained residues of about two dozen pesticides. NIPHM collects vegetables from markets and farm gates in the city every month to detect the presence of pesticides, if any.City doctors warned that consumption of vegetables laced with pesticide residue, even within permissible levels, may lead to severe health issues, which includes damage to the kidneys and brain. Human body tends to accumulate pesticides and when it crosses the tolerance limit, severe health problems surface.A study of the NIPHM monthly reports for 2018 reveals the presence of many toxins in vegetables such as tomato, brinjal, cabbage , okra, green chilli, French beans, coccinea, bottle gourd and cauliflower. Some of the chemicals are not recommended, which means they are not meant for human consumption or spraying on vegetables.Senior physician Dr Hari Kishan Boorugu of Apollo Hospitals, Hyderguda, Hyderabad, said each pesticide was associated with different health problems. A little quantity of pesticide may not cause harm, but it creates severe problems in the long term. Organophosphorus pesticides can damage nerves, he said, warning that pesticide-poisoning issues ranged from nerve weakness, muscle wasting to diarrhoea. Often, high doses could cause seizures.In October (latest month for which data is available) NIPHM analyzed 20 cabbage samples randomly collected from markets in Shamshabad and Budvel. Five of the samples were contaminated with residues of Alachlor and Malathion. In September, two of the 25 samples of cabbage collected from Shamshabad, Mehdipatnam and Kothapet contained Pyraclostrobin and Novaluron.Five of the 27 samples of cabbage collected in August from Shamshabad, Mehdipatnam and Dairy Farm showed the presence of residues of Carbendazim, Metalaxyl, Captafol, Thiophanate methyl, Indoxacarb, Novaluron and Ethion. In July, all the 15 samples of capsicum collected from Mehdipatnam and Shamshabad had residues of Acephate, Carbendazim, Imidacloprid, Flusilazole, Tricyclazole, Fenpropathrin, Phenol,4-Bromo-2-Chloro, Bifenthrin and Thiophanate methyl.Twenty samples of capsicum collected from city markets in June were contaminated with nine pesticides. In May, 14 samples of cauliflower were analyzed and 10 of those were found contaminated with six pesticides. Three of the 10 samples collected in April had pesticide residue. During March, of the 10 samples collected from Mehdipatnam, Hyderguda and Monda market, none had pesticide contamination.In February, 29 of the 71 vegetable samples had residues of 19 pesticides. In January, 48 samples were studied and 17 were contaminated."

The words describe this festival perfectly and the celebrations are in full swing in my house. The Christmas tree is up with blingy lights and lots of gifts are waiting to be unwrapped. At school, the kids are learning a new carol every day and belting it out proudly at the top of their voices just when I need a moment of peace. And, yes, most importantly, the mistletoe is ready for some loving kisses! For me, Christmas is about good food, wine and being with the people I love.Every person has his or her own way of expressing their love and gratitude. For me its all about cooking and sharing the pleasures of good food with my family and hosting dinner parties for friends.As you can imagine, my kitchen is super busy these days and the alluring aroma of whatever is baking in the oven fills the house, replacing the cold air with a cosy warmth. I have been doing a line-up of dinners in red, white and green. My favourite is this Portobello Mushroom, Baby Spinach And Roast Tomato Quiche in a light wholewheat crust. I serve it with a millet and greens salad for a healthy wholesome dinner.The Mexican Tortilla Lasagne is my take on the overdone Mexican fajitas and tacos. I make it just like a lasagne, but replace the pasta sheets with tortilla wraps and make multiple layers with Mexican black bean filling, fresh spicy salsa and grated cheddar or mozzarella cheese. Cover with foil and bake in the oven at 180C for 20 minutes and a further 10 minutes uncovered. Its delicious comfort food!Making mulled wine and stocking up bottles of it is an annual event at home. It is as simple as slow-cooking red wine with a bit of sugar, cinnamon, star anise, cloves, orange and lemon zest and some vanilla till the flavours have all come together. Aaah, cant you smell it already?Talking of mulled wine, I want to share with you my classic Berry Mulled Wine Sauce recipe. I make a jar of this goodness and keep it in the fridge. Just heat it up and serve over ice cream, cheesecake, panna cotta or simply sandwich it between two cookies for that little bite of indulgence. You can use strawberry, blueberry or any other berry, frozen or fresh.My Spiced Apple Cake is adapted from chef Ottolenghis recipe (you would have seen him on the popular MasterChef Australia last season). So easy to make but so delicious and good-looking. Ditch the classic apple pie and try making this, it definitely makes a humble apple look super glamorous in this glitzy season! Enjoy it as it is or heat it up and pair it with some vanilla ice cream.While we have sorted out the adults with some mulled wine, we need something special for the little elves to drink while hopping around the Christmas tree. Since strawberries are in season now, I created a fun Strawberry Mint Lemonade that is a big hit with my kids. Add in some fresh mint and green lime slices and you have a beautiful pop of colours to fit into the festive spirit. And if you spike it with a dash of vodka or white rum, you have the perfect cocktail.I hope you enjoy making and sharing these goodies. As for me, I am off to southern Italy to celebrate Christmas with my husbands family. And what is it all about? You guessed it, eating, drinking and more eating!

She had gone to the Khan Market eatery, and enjoyed her chorizo and baby potatoes with wilted spinach and poached egg so much that she had a second helping of the same dish. I am, at present, not on speaking terms with chorizos and other porky products, but still thought Sly Granny deserved a dekko. Then, just a few days ago, we got a call from a dear friend. Were we free to have lunch with her and her daughter (our much loved niece)? The answer to that was pithy: Yes, we said.So there we were in Khan Market one sunny afternoon, looking for Sly Granny. I asked around, and was told to take the middle lane, turning left if we were approaching it from Bahrisons. Sly Granny is on the left, on the first floor. The address is 4, Khan Market, and the phone number for booking your tables (which you should do, because it was rather busy on a weekday, too) is 011-4905 8941.The dcor is pleasing, with nice old-style posters on the staircase and the walls. And on the window sills they have lots of fresh herbs growing, which are added to salads and other dishes, we were told by the helpful servers. Sly Granny, which has a branch in Bangalore, opened in Delhi in August.We asked for chicken salad with walnut and celery  from the small plates section. Our friend wanted fish moilee with curry leave rice and kasundi jhal muri, and the niece, mushroom and black olive tortellini. My wife asked for the roast chicken with garlic mash, asparagus, green beans and win jus and I, the grilled fish. Mine was a Calcutta betki, which is a fish that I enjoy, and the friends moilee was sole. And for dessert, since we were told brie en croute would take some time, we asked for lava cake and affogato.Crispy textureEvery dish was superb. The walnuts in the salad were crunchy, and the chicken had infused in the flavours of celery. The moilee was a bit different, and we had been told that the fish would be crumb fried. So the dish consisted of a little mound of flavoured rice with two pieces of golden fried fish on top, and some sauces on the side. The friend loved it. My fish was delicious, too. It was firm within with a crispy texture and came with a lemon-garlic butter sauce on a bed of lip-smacking buttered and mashed potatoes and topped with micro greens (from the window sill!). I squeezed a piece of lemon over it, and it was like nirvana.The mushroom and black olive tortellini was nice and rich, and had a sauce prepared with basil cream and brown butter and flavoured with sage and toasted pine nuts. I had a bit of the chicken (with garlic mash, asparagus, green beans and win jus)  and thought it was amazing. It had a crispy skin, while the flesh was juicy and tender. We ended our meal with a rich lava chocolate cake served with vanilla ice cream, and the affogato, a nice mix of bitter and sweet tastes.This is a place that is known for its food  its Salmon Gravalax (salmon cured with salt, sugar and dill), pulled chicken tacos with tomato chutney and pickled onions, duck ragout tagliatelle and black pepper salmon. But I know what I am going to go back for once pigs and I resume our happy relationship (happy for me, that is, alas not so happy for the poor pigs). I will have their biscuits and gravy  buttermilk biscuits, pork sausages, sage and bacon gravy.I am counting the days. 10, 9, 8..."
5ce56648e8e3fc56af40bc2d,"Breakfast, lunch and dinner in Melbourne",https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/food/breakfast-lunch-and-dinner-in-melbourne/cid/1679623,2018-12-22,,Telegraph,"Melbourne is a big city with a heart like London and the soul of old-world Australia. The city witnessed a Gold Rush for a few decades, onwards of 1850, and was set to be the next New York, so youll find marvelous remnants of Victorian architecture and ornate lattice-decorated homes alongside a thriving central business district. The centre of the city is all walking distance and is interspersed with restaurants and trendy bars. It is a fabulous city in which to unwind since it has a lively outdoor cafe life, wine bars and the two wine-growing areas  Mornington Peninsula and Yarra Valley, both great weekend getaways and an hours drive away. Meanwhile, here are my 10 must-do things in Melbourne.Collins Kitchen, Grand HyattHave your breakfast here. Grand Hyatt must be one of the best locations for any city hotel and its breakfast is so stunning in terms of quality and variety that you can easily skip lunch that day. It isnt surprising that they have won the Gourmet Travellers Best Hotel Breakfast Award for three years running. A unique feature is the range of fresh juices squeezed on the spot in any combo you want and the smoothies. Anyone who loves Asian food would be delighted with the restaurants wok-and-steamer station (yes for breakfast!). They do all the baking and viennoiserie in-house. Croissants, predictably, are just perfect.Geloso Gelati at Queen Victoria Market, which is spread over seven hectares Image: Karen AnandQueen Victoria MarketSpread over seven hectares, Queen Victoria Market is the largest open-air market in the southern hemisphere. Around 1,000 traders sell everything, from exotic Australian fruits and vegetables, local and imported gourmet foods, meat, fish and poultry to hardware, clothing and authentic Australian artefacts and souvenirs. Its a traditional Victorian structure built in 1878 during the heyday of the citys Gold Rush.The best way to understand how the market operates and a chance to meet some of the third and fourth generation vendors is to enroll for the Ultimate Foodies tour. I had Carmel guiding me around and she was a wealth of information, plus the exercise allowed me to taste without feeling embarrassed. Merchandise is removed from the stalls at the end of each trading day. It is a reflection of the eating trends in the city today with a lot of organic produce, kangaroo and game and a huge range of smoked meats, olives and cheese. It is also home to new and upcoming eateries and food concepts like the one I stumbled upon, Geloso Gelati.Queen Victoria Deli is a hidden gem of the food and cafe scene Image: Karen AnandHidden Secrets tourI thoroughly enjoyed the Hidden Secrets tour with Fiona Sweetman. I enrolled on the Cafe Culture walk but Fiona was flexible enough to take me to some of Melbournes designer shops, point out some hip and happening rooftop bars and have a great cup of coffee in the bargain. Diverting from the main drag of coffee-lined laneways, the Cafe Culture walk takes you on a tour of Melbournes hidden-away food and cafe scene, meeting people who are passionate about tea, coffee and food. Most importantly, you discover places you would never have found on your own and get a real taste of Melbournes unique flavour. They also do history and architecture walks and a progressive degustation for hardcore foodies.Chin Chin, a wacky Melbourne eatery Image: Karen AnandLunch at Chin ChinA breath of fresh air on the Melbourne eating-out scene, this is a wacky Melbourne eatery down Flinders Lane. The staff are young and perky and the food pretty amazing. Must-try items are the Barramundi and Crispy Pork Salad, the most amazing Tom Yum Soup I have had in a long time and the Jungle Curry with Steamed Fish and Diamond Clams. If youre uncertain of what to order, just go for the Feed Me#1 where they give you a selection of their favourite dishes until you say no more. Theyve also produced two very good cookbooks. I highly recommend Chin Chin, the cookbook.Pellegrinis is a must if you want to understand the history of Italians in Melboune Image: Karen AnandCoffee and strudel at Pellegrinis Espresso BarHundreds of Italians immigrated to Victoria in the late 19th century and then after World War II when many agricultural workers from southern Italy chose to settle down in Victoria to escape the economic hardships back home. The area around Bourke Street in central Melbourne is where many of them started small businesses, restaurants and coffee shops. Pellegrinis Espresso Bar started in 1954 as an espresso bar with, reportedly, the first espresso machine in Melbourne. Twenty years later, two friends, Sisto Malaspina and Nino Pangrazio, bought it over and continued the tradition, keeping the same menu and decor. Pellegrinis is a Melbourne institution. The iconic espresso bar serves authentic Italian food and, of course, fantastic coffee. I first discovered it when my son was studying there. It was the favourite for hungry students and it wouldnt be uncommon to be invited by the owners to share enormous bowls of spaghetti with tomato sauce or lasagna drooling with cheese. Pellegrinis is like stepping back in time and a must if you want to breathe and understand the history of Italians in the city. The Apple Strudel is to die for. The cafe is now listed by the National Trust of Australia.Attica's brilliantly thought-out 17-course tasting menu is worth every penny Image: Karen AnandDinner at AtticaIts best not to say too much about the award-winning, much-talked-about, hard-to-get-into Attica. Ben Shewry has been making waves on the Australian eating-out scene for several years now. Attica was recently awarded number 20 in the world on the prestigious Worlds 50 Best Restaurants list (prepared by the UK media company William Reed Business Media).My expectations were high as I took a taxi on the 40-minute journey from central Melbourne to an eastern suburb called Ripponlea to eat at one of the most-sought-after restaurants in Australia.There is a three-month waiting list to get a reservation and I arrived promptly at 6.30pm. I was squeezed in after much persuasion. Mindfully sourced, Australian flavours and produce (marron, finger lime, kangaroo and abalone), skilful cooking and a lot of intellect goes behind his food. Ben Shewry spending more than half an hour chatting with me appeared shocking when one considers the evening he had ahead of him. It is a brilliantly thought-out 17-course tasting menu only and at Aus $295 without wine is worth every penny.Cruffins at Lune Croissanterie, a current rage Image: Karen AnandLune CroissanterieTaking the city by storm is Lune Croissanterie in the old neighbourhood of Fitzroy. Their new branch, right opposite Grand Hyatt on Collins Street, is testament to their ever-growing queues. This is an Australian version of the famous French croissant in many new avatars. Although they claim their plain croissant is the bestseller, you must gorge on the Lemon Curd Cruffin  a cross between a croissant and a muffin, almond croissant  and their savoury Ham and Gruyere. A great way to start the day!Mosaic floors and an arched glass skylight at 19th century Block Arcade Source: Karen AnandBlock and Royal ArcadesThe opulent 19th century Block Arcade with the iconic Hopetoun Tea Room and the Royal Arcade with a great little chocolate shop called Koko Black complete my shopping experience in the city. The Block Arcade, part of the Golden Mile heritage walk, is blessed with original stained glass windows, mosaic floors and an arched glass skylight. There are a number of independent Aussie retailers, including Creswick Woollen Mills, Alpaca Collection and Beechworth Honey. Similar in style is Royal Arcade, the oldest arcade in Australia. While youre shopping, check out Gaunts Clock, where mythical figures Gog and Magog ring the chimes every hour.The iconic Hopetoun Tea Room Source: Karen AnandAesop body careI was introduced to this local bath, body and skin care brand when I first visited Melbourne almost 20 years ago. I am so happy that it not only survives, its thriving and has several branches in the city and all over Australia. The brands shops look like Victorian apothecaries with modern design and functional brown bottles. Its like a thinking, 21st century version of the Body Shop. Products I buy there include the geranium leaf body balm and hydrating body treatment oil, hand creams and hydrating cream for stressed skin. The products are made from natural botanicals, so they are safe and pure and smell delicious. Ingredients are all declared on the packaging, unlike a lot of expensive cosmetic brands, and the staff is very well informed. By the way, its all reasonably priced.A collection of Australian and imported cheese presided over by Victor Persinette Source: Karen AnandSpring Street GrocerThe deli and the juice bar here is a great place to buy and see gourmet products. I also discovered a little secret air-conditioned cheese shop and tasting room downstairs, which has an amazing collection of Australian and imported cheese presided over by Victor Persinette.Karen Anand is a culinary consultant, food writer and entrepreneur.

5ce56975e8e3fc56af40be11,Waiter  there’s bacteria in my salad!,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/waiter-theres-bacteria-in-my-salad/article25793741.ece,2018-12-21,,The Hindu,"Heres some unpalatable news. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are hiding in your food, not just in the meat, and fish, but also in your tomatoes and apples. Thats right. Samples of raw food lifted across Chennai have tested positive for colistin-resistant bacteria, conforming to a global trend.A paper in the Journal of Global Antimicrobial Resistance by a group of researchers from Apollo Cancer Hospital, Chennai, and Christian Medical College, Vellore, carried out the survey in one city alone, lifting samples from 22 locations  shops and homes  between October and November 2017; 46.4% of the samples were found to harbour the highly-resistant bacteria.Last resortLead author Abdul Ghafur, of Apollo Hospitals, said: In the practice of medicine, colistin is called holy water. Its the last resort for very sick patients. Colistin resistance is already a problem in clinical practice, now we have established food origins in India.Globally, there are many publications outlining the route of transmission of colistin resistance via the food chain. So, frankly, when we found the colistin-resistant bacteria in our samples, we were not surprised at all, Dr. Ghafur explained.While handling of produce could play a role, the main cause of contamination in fruits and vegetables is a spillover from the poultry industry. Colistin is used as a growth factor in poultry, and poultry litter is used as manure in agricultural fields.Eating such contaminated food every day will allow the resistant bacteria to invade the human gut, rendering the host resistant to the powerful antibiotic Colistin, in case he/or she were to develop an infection.Undoubtedly, cooking the food will kill the bacteria. But, meanwhile, the food has already contaminated the surface in the kitchen, and people who handle the food have also been exposed, researchers said.Colistin is used extensively as a growth promoter and India has no regulations to prevent this practice, though many European countries have banned the use of colistin in poultry, the paper says. The Chennai Declaration of medical societies in India and National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance plan have made recommendations to ban the use of antibiotics as growth promoters."

The entrance which was turned into a dumping spot years ago, continues to overflow with waste every day. Not a thing has changed about the facade of the market except that more stakeholders dump garbage here now, says S. Saravanan, a vendor.Thayir Market, as it is referred to by the public, is at least 60 years old, say the vendors. What first started off as a fish market later saw the sale of fruits, dairy items and later vegetables.It is one of Madurais oldest markets, Mr. Saravanan says, and there is history in each of its corners. Currently, there are 152 shops at the market selling a variety of vegetables. This centrally located market also falls under the area of development zone of the Smart City Mission. A number of issues plagues the market and its surrounding areas, says S. Deepalakshmi, a tomato vendor.At least 100 trucks frequent East Marret Street to deliver a variety of items to the vegetable market and to the wholesale markets nearby. This creates extensive traffic in the area and leads to commotion as there is no proper pedestrian crossing. The quality of roads is poor too, she adds.R. Annapechi, who has sold vegetables at the market for 40 years now, says though the market now has asbestos sheet instead of thatched roofs, the smell of piling garbage has worsened with time.I cannot eat or sit in my shop because of the hideous smell. Some say they get used to the smell with time, but I have not. The market is in its worst condition during monsoon time, she adds. We can now see pelts and waste parts of slaughtered goats dumped into the bins. The hotels nearby also throw their waste here, she says. What began as one bin has now become three, says K. Ammaiappan, a functionary of Centre of Indian Trade Unions and a vegetable vendorMs. Deepalakshmi says there are no proper toilet facilities for women inside the market. The toilet inside the market complex is dysfunctional, she adds.The vendors also say the composting bins kept by the Corporation inside the premises have not been useful. Mr. Saravanan and P. Kaniraja, both functionaries of the CITU, say it was used only for one week by vendors. No crackdown was conducted on its usage after the initial enthusiasm expressed by the civic body in 2017, they add.Corporation Commissioner S. Aneesh Sekhar says the civic body was planning to instal 10 underground bins as part of the Smart City Mission plan.Thayir Market has been chosen as one of the locations, he adds."

Those rescued had been brought to the plantation in Dudda hobli, and been forced to work in extremely poor conditions. The rescued labourers were subsequently housed in a school nearby on Monday morning.The plight of the labourers came to light after one labourer, 50, a native of Chikkamagaluru went missing from his home. His son initially filed a complaint in Chikkamagaluru,before lodging one at the Banavara police station, where he had relatives, seeking assistance in tracing his father. While the cops went on the 50-year-old mans trail, the son started searching for his father in parallel. At Arasikere junction, a few miscreants allegedly tried capturing him, but he evaded them and lodged a complaint at the Dudda police station.Acting on this information, a team of police officers led by superintendent of police (SP) Prakash Gowda raided the plantation in Savanthahalli around 10pm on Sunday. While 32 men and 16 women were forced into labour, cops also found four children, belonging to some of these labourers in the sheds.Police said that the plantation was owned by Krishnegowda, a resident of Bengaluru, who had leased it out to Mounesh aka Murali. Along with his associates Basvaraj, Pradeep and Nagraj, Mounesh allegedly lured those looking for jobs across the state on the promise of high wages, but turning them into bonded labourers later.Police said that some of the people in the plantation had been working as bonded labourers for the past three or four years. Those running the farm allegedly restricted the movement of the labourers inside the farm, and housed them in temporary sheds, besides subjecting them to torture . The labourers were also taken to other farms in Nittur, Gandasi, Chikkamagaluru and Sakleshpura, where they were made to plough, plant, harvest and spray pesticides, police said.One of the rescued labourers, Vijay, a native of Chikkamagaluru, explained how the accused trapped helpless individuals such as himself. They wait near the Arasikere Railway Junction, and approach daily wage labourers like myself, promising us wages of up to Rs 500 per day and three free meals for loading tomatoes on to trucks. Once we are hauled into vehicles, we are brought to the plantation and confined here, Vijay said.Recalling the harrowing ordeal, another victim Ramesh said that the labourers would be beaten with iron rods when they demanded wages. Ratnamma, a native of Haveri district, said that the children, all of whom were aged below 12 were fed once in the morning. I returned to the shed only at 9pm, when I would cook their dinner and feed them. They would be given nothing in the interim period, said Ratnamma.The rescued labourers are being housed at the Morarji Desai School in MD Hosur.

With the deadline fast approaching, the demand for alternatives for these pollutants is on the rise. We speak to a few entrepreneurs who have beenproviding alternatives to disposable plastic...It is said that plastic toothbrushes can turn extremely toxic when they start decaying after centuries. So, why leave more carbon print in the over- polluted earth, asks G Venkateswaran of Nature Village, Erode. Our toothbrushes are made of bamboo and the bristles are made of corn fibre or charcoal. We believe in living in harmony with nature. We provide organic cotton, non-violent silk and natural dyes obtained from fruits, seeds and flowers and roots. Some of the interesting additions are fibre seats, seat pads, pillows, banana fibre, clay water bottles, bamboo key chains, bamboo straws, bamboo sets and bamboo shaving razor. He adds, The car seat pad and pillows are filled with banana fibre yarns, pure cotton and vettiver. They are covered with cotton cloth and non-hazardous ink. We have cotton sanitary pads and diapers, organic liquids and cloth wash as well. Though the awareness among people is still low, its gradually increasing, especially among youngsters.Marutham foods and Natural Products from Palani offers bio-degradable plates, bowls, trays and lid, made of sustainable natural resources including corn starch. They are sturdy and suitable for hot, wet and even oily food. They are fit to be used in microwave oven or kept inside the refrigerator. They degrade in a short period and are fully compostable. The important fact is that they do not impact the colour, odour or taste of the food. They do not leave any chemical residue, says one of its representatives.When you step out of home next time, dont forget to carry a bio-degradable bag. Ecofora of Regeno Ventures has come out with bio-degradable bags, primarily made of tapioca starch and natural additives. These bags are hundred per cent plastic free and can be recycled after use. We have different varieties of bags  seat covers, shopping bags, carry bags, medical bags and garbage bags. They decompose in 150 days, do not leave toxic residue and are eco-friendly. They are also dissolvable in high temperature. The polythene bag, on the other hand, remains in the landfill for more than 500 years, says R Soundharya, distributor in the Coimbatore region.Tucked away at a residential colony in Saibaba Colony, Coimbatore is Eco Green Unit, which delves into the concept of creating wealth from waste. Discarded banana fibre, coconut shells, areca palm leaves and kora grass have been given a new lease of life by converting them into spoons, plates, glasses, boxes, trays, yoga mats, floor mats, soap trays and pots. Some of these products are not only bio-degradable, but can also be converted into manure. Its founder SK Babu says, Our unit is located at Madhampatti village, near Siruvani in Coimbatore. We provide training in making areca leaf products, mat weaving, coir pot making and paper bag making. Eco plates and cutlery are healthy and hygienic and are great alternatives to plastics. They are biodegradable and eco-friendly. The pots made of coir can be used in gardening, landscaping and water conservation.Its time to go eco-friendly with stationery at work. Coimbatore-based Papcil has come out with pencils made of recycled paper. We source our raw material from factories and churn out pencils from them. The highlight, however, is the seed pencil. A seed is placed inside a gelatin capsule attached to the pencil. We have seeds of 13 varieties that comprise vegetables like tomatoes and chillies and flowers like marigold. Since the seeds do not last long when kept inside a gelatin capsule, we cover it with coir pith. This can last up to six months. After using the pencil, all you need to do is throw the seed into the soil and water it, says Gowtham Prasath, its founder.Disposable diapers and sanitary napkins take many years to decompose and remain in the landfills for a long time. Thats why Pollachi-based Dhivya Sidharth introduced reusable cloth diapers called KiddieHug. Cloth diapers are water-proof, leak-free, chemical-free, easy to use and one size (customisable for kids weighing 4-17kg). The reusable cloth diapers can be used from birth until the kids get potty trained. These diapers come in attractive colours and the babies need not wear anything over it. They are made from natural fibres like hemp cotton and bamboo cotton. Instead of disposing the diaper after single use, one can wash and reuse it. Mano Sathya Selvaraj, who has her own brand of cloth diapers called Apple Blossoms, says that cloth diapers are not just easy on the environment, but on the baby and wallet as well. She says, Bamboo cotton absorbs water easily. Our diapers come in two sizes  newborn and one size. We provide inserts with microfibre, hemp, charcoal bamboo and bamboo cotton. The diaper wet-free bags can be used to hold soiled and unuseddiapers."

So, if you dont like what you hear from me and if you have rotten eggs and tomatoes, please raise your hand!The green checkered gamchha (a coarse cotton towel) that he wears like a badge of pride today has been a significant part of this 68-year-old man  be it as a teenager sleeping rough at railway platforms, using it to fling bricks at adversaries during the Naxalite movement in the 70s, or to wipe his sweat as a rickshaw-puller ferrying people around south Kolkata. It is a part of my identity. I may be among tie wearers, but the gamchha keeps me rooted, helps me represent the class I belong and still trying to belong and survive.Byapari made quite an impression with anecdotes spanning his days as a child of Bangladeshi immigrants living in camps; as a rebel thrown into prison that he calls university because that is where I learnt to read and write with a stick on the ground and which sheltered me from the fear of being run over by cars or dying due to a lack of access to medicines; and his providential encounter with the late writer Mahasweta Devi , who discovered and shaped the firebrand author that Byapari is today.Although a staunch atheist, Byapari believes it was his fate that turned his life around when the lady passenger he was ferrying on his rickshaw was intrigued by his quest for the meaning of the Bengali word jijibisha. Will to live, she explained, before scribbling her name and address on a piece of paper that read Mahashweta Devi, who went on to publish his writings in her journal Bartika.Today, Byapari, who has authored close to a dozen novels and over a hundred short stories, and has been given awards for his work, lives on the southernmost fringes of Kolkata, where he cooks midday meals for students of the Helen Keller Badhir Vidyalaya for the deaf and the blind every day, unless he is advocating for Dalit rights or hopping Litfests.Im grateful for where I am today. But theres one thing that saddens me. Im invited to events where I get to choose from 150 kinds of roti, and a days rate for my hotel room is more than what I can afford to pay as house rent for a month. If people spared a thought for the condition people like me live in for the rest of our 364 days, it would make my writings, and days spent in jail, worth it! he signed off."

The scheme is implemented by the Union Food Processing Ministry, that has a corpus of Rs. 500 crore and aims to aid farmers in times of price fluctuation in tomatoes, onions and potatoes. The State is considering seeking transport subsidy for onion growers to sell especially stored onions in consuming States and working on ex-gratia grant to compensate affected growers.Onion prices have come under pressure because of the arrival of stored onions as well as fresh kharif crop.

A camera focusing on the kitchen, where the tomato bath that was served as prasadam to the devotees was prepared, is also dysfunctional, much to the cops chagrin.Police pointed out that the temple premises are mostly uninhabited in the evening, and as evidence of the tragedy having been an act of sabotage mounts, cops said that miscreants may have been up to some mischief at that time. Had this been a case of just food poisoning, we would not have seen the effects as immediately, nor would they have been so severe. In this case, reaction to the prasadam was immediate. All those who had the tomato bath were seen writhing in pain near the kitchen, a police official said.Shankar, one of the priests at the temple, said that nearly 15kg of rice was used to prepare the tomato bath, which was to be distributed among them and the devotees. It was for a special occasion since the foundation stone was laid to build the temples gopuram . But, some devotees arrived early, and we served them food, deciding to eat the same at a later time.

The cool weather and all this love and happiness around calls for some warm, cosy food. For me, its all about hearty one-pot hot dishes for the family to share.I love the flavours from the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern kitchens  simple, fresh ingredients cooked with bags of flavour. My culinary philosophy emphasises on cooking with local seasonal produce. There are beautiful pumpkins, carrots, oranges and greens in the market these days and there are so many innovative ways to prepare them. Roasting vegetables and meat in the oven is a great way to cook as you dont have to keep hovering around the stove. Also, the nutritional value remains intact and you get a lovely smokey-charred flavour.Here are some of my current favourite Mediterranean winter dishes that you must try making soon. They are vegetarian but you could add some grilled chicken or fish to them. Alternatively, enjoy them as an accompaniment to your meat or seafood dish.Roast Pumpkin, saffron and orange soupA boring pumpkin soup gets transformed into an orchestra of flavours.Ingredients: 2tbsp olive oil, one onion (cut in wedges), 500g pumpkin (cut in wedges), 1tbsp chilli/sriracha sauce, 5-6 saffron strands, zest of one orange, 500ml (or more) water,  cup coconut milk (or cream), salt and freshly-cracked pepper,  cup pumpkin seeds (toasted), chilli flakes, 2tsp honey/date syrup, fresh coriander/parsleyMethod:Preheat the oven to 220 degrees Celsius.

I ran my hand along the leg and found that there was a very tender lump. There is agonising pain whenever I touch it.This is probably a trigger point  an area where the muscles and nerves have tangled up. It needs to be released. You can do this yourself by massaging it with your thumb. You can also apply ice for 10 minutes, rubbing it in a circular motion. You can use a foam roller to massage out the pain.You can go to a physical therapist who will use a non-invasive device like an ultrasound to remove the trigger. Triggers tend to reform. Stretch the muscles regularly to prevent this.Diet woesI am overweight and feel guilty about it. I diet and exercise. I do manage to lose some weight, only to regain it all and then some more.When you diet and starve your body of calories, the brain signals that you are hungry. Immediately, you crave simple carbohydrate snacks, sweets and chocolates. The blood sugar level spikes and you feel satiated. Unfortunately the tendency is to do this repeatedly at ever shorter intervals. That contributes to the weight gain.You could eat a fruit, a carrot or a raw tomato if you are hungry and steer clear of the carbohydrates. That way your hunger pangs may be temporarily satisfied.How much exercise?I am 60 years old and I retired a few months ago. I walk 30 minutes a day. Is that enough?It is good that you are walking. Try to reach your target heart rate. This is calculated as 80 per cent of 220 minus age. Muscles tend to waste as you grow older, so you also need to do weight training at least three times a week using light weights (2-kilo dumbbells). Stretches and yoga prevent stiffness brought on by increasing age. If you do all this, your balance will remain good, muscle and bones will be healthy and falls will be prevented.Stubborn babyMy one-month-old baby refuses to feed at my wifes breast. Should we start bottle feeds?Babies have a rooting reflex. If you touch the side of the cheek with the nipple or the tip of your finger, the baby turns its head and latches on. If you try to force the nipple into the mouth, the baby will reject it.Avoid beansI feel bloated, my stomach hurts, and I pass embarrassing amounts of gas.This may be due to your diet. You may be able to reduce it if you eat fewer beans and carbohydrates. Also, avoid aerated beverages. Drink plenty of plain water, at least three litres a day. Eat at least 2-3 fruits per day and cultivate regular bowel habits.Morning sicknessMy daughter is pregnant, and she vomits eight to 10 times a day. It is tough to watch.Vomiting during pregnancy may occur because of a urinary tract infection or for no reason. The obstetrician will be able to sort this out. There are a few simple manoeuvres to help. She could walk for a half hour morning and evening in the fresh air on level ground. She could leave the kitchen area when food is being fried. She could have acupressure performed on her wrists for 20 minutes every morning and evening. She could also give up food and eat only vanilla ice cream for a day. For some mysterious reason, it helps some women end vomiting. If all this fails then tablets may be required.The writer is a paediatrician with a family practice at Vellore and author of Staying Healthy in Modern India.

It has also started making puree from juicy vegetables like tomatoes and other local fruits like guava, banana and sapota (chickoo).Starting from mango pulp to dried chickoo and all types of frozen vegetables, the South Gujarat region has it all. All types of vegetables and fruits, including their variants, could form a rich export market for gulf countries, the US and UK, earning more than Rs 1,000 crore in the next five years. On the other hand, shrimp farming in South Gujarat has gained prominence over the last decade with export potential of more than Rs 900 crore. Majority of the shrimp export is done from Mumbai and South India ports.Aquaculture expert Dr Manoj Sharma told TOI, For fresh shrimp supply to Gulf countries, an international air cargo in Surat will be a blessing. However, the biggest boon will be on domestic front as we get more than 400 crore shrimp babies from Pondicherry via Vizag and Chennai. These shrimp babies arrive in Mumbai and then reach parts of Gujarat, including Surat and South Gujarat, via road.APMC, Surat, chairman Raman Jani told TOI, We have set-up the production plant with an intention to boost local farmers income and earning foreign exchange for the country. At present, not many farmers have APEDA licences, but they can go through us and still reap the benefit of exporting their products. We hope Surat international air cargo will go a very long way in establishing South Gujarat as a major agro product export market."

From chopping to deep frying, we tend to cook all the goodness out of food. There are, however, ways we can retain nutrition without compromising on taste. Heres how to go about it.Chop, chopThe usual process of preparing vegetables for cooking is to peel them all  even the ones that dont need it  cut them into small pieces and soak in water. This removes dust, grime, pesticides and added colours. It also removes about 40 per cent of vitamins B and C.Proper cleaning is absolutely essential to get rid of toxic substances, even if you lose some nutrition in the process, says skin specialist Dr Sanjay Ghosh. The added colours and pesticides are poisonous and can cause severe disorders. Dr Ghosh suggests that vegetables be washed thoroughly in running water or soaked before chopping so that the nutrition is not washed out along with pesticides. They should then be cut in large pieces and cooked quickly. Peeling vegetables is not necessary as peels have fibre and nutrition. These fibres are good for people with diabetes, high cholesterol and too many fat deposits, Dr Ghosh adds. Peel the vegetables thinly so that you can save some fibres and nutrition while getting rid of toxic chemicals.Smoking hotMost people cook in smoking hot oil but this process is incorrect. All cooking oils have a specific smoke point  the temperature at which oil molecules break apart and give off smoke. That is also when the beneficial fatty acids and vitamins go up in smoke and a host of harmful free radicals are produced. Free radicals cause inflammation that leads to high cholesterol, heart diseases, stroke, Alzheimers, cancer and many other disorders. Forget eating, even being exposed to this smoke while cooking is dangerous, especially for those who suffer from asthma and allergy.To protect yourself, heat the empty pan first. Then pour in oil, heat for a few more minutes and add the ingredients before the oil gives off smoke. Cover the pan and cook on low heat.Deep friedPuri, kachauri, pakoras, chops  Indian cooking has an array of deep fried dishes. Regular consumption of them may lead to obesity, which is linked to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, stroke and heart disease.Apart from free radicals, smoking hot oil also produces trans-fats, which raise the level of bad cholesterol and the risk of cerebral stroke. If you recycle oil used for frying, you create aldehyde, an extremely harmful organic substance that leads to a host of disorders including Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease. So should one throw away oil left over after deep frying? Well, it depends on the smoke point of the oil. Safflower, canola, mustard, sesame and coconut oil dont disintegrate at moderately high temperatures. If you fry at moderate heat  and not extremely high heat  then you can reuse them. Strain the oil once cool to get rid of burnt particles (harmful organic substances) and recycle. But if the oil looks turbid instead of clear, throw it away.Incidentally, coconut oil is one of those rare oils that has a high smoke point. This means you can safely use it for deep frying. Unfortunately, while popular in southern India, coconut oil is not accepted as a cooking medium in the rest of India.Choose shallow frying [like a paratha] over deep frying. This is not crispy but tastes good and the nutrition is preserved, says nutritionist Vijaya Agarwala. If you love crispy fries, get an air frier, she suggests.Cooking stylesNow lets talk about cooking procedures and how they affect nutrition.Boil: People think it is a healthy process even if the end product is bland. However, throwing away the water you boil in means losing 60 per cent of the nutrition of Vitamin B, Vitamin C and minerals. This is also true of rice. So boil things in just enough water and if there is any extra left, use it to make gravy.Also, let the water boil first and then put in the rice, lentils or veggies. Always cook on a low fire, with a lid on the pan. You can also use a pressure cooker to boil food in.Steam: This process of cooking retains the most nutrition. Vegetables such as tomato, carrot and broccoli become more nutritious when you steam them. If you saute the ingredients slightly and then steam them, the dish is tasty as well as healthy.Poach: Poaching helps retain the nutrition of an egg. You can also poach thin slices of fish and some vegetables (such as carrots and capsicum).Grill: You can grill vegetables, fish and meat but be careful not to char them. Any charred or blackened parts should be removed. Eating such parts can lead to cancer in the breast and pancreas as the process brings about harmful chemical changes in meat and chicken. Grill only the lean cut (low on fat) of meat or chicken.Saute: The easiest way is to cook in the saut mode on an induction cooker. You can even do it on low heat on a gas. Use olive oil for the best nutrition (especially anti-oxidants).Microwave: Extensive research has shown that cooking in the microwave retains nutritive value but can make food dry. Sprinkle some water on the food before reheating it to keep it moist. However, never use a plastic or melamine vessel to reheat food in the microwave oven."

Dried eucalyptus branches, which are burnt to crack the stone underneath, litter the hill. The entire hillock has been carved out, leaving just a small fort on top.Every night, 2 to 4 truckloads of stones are taken from the hill... the mining has been happening for decades by some influential people, said a villager.Over the years, quarrying has come to the edge of the fort. Now, blocks are removed from right under the fort. The fort wont last long, said the villager. The origin of the fort is unclear, with some historians believing that the structure could date back to the 17th century, where it was used as a defence post for the army. It is from this post, that they could get a view of the plains stretching till Bengaluru.However, there is no legislation to protect the structure.No recognition givenThe unprotected site is just one of the estimated 30,000 historical structures dotting the States landscape that has not been recognised under either the Central Acts governing the Archaeological Department or State laws for the State Archaeological Department.Experts believe a majority of these structures, like the Uddappanahalli fort, are under threat. Their fears were communicated to Tourism Department officials during a recent meeting on protecting such monuments.There has been no survey of unprotected monuments since 1942. Surveys do not cost much, and there are enough archaeologists and students who can do it.It needs to be done before we lose out on a lot of history. Weve already spoiled megalithic burial (10,000 to 30,000 years old) sites in most places of the states, said N.S. Rangaraju, a former Archaeology professor and a member of the Heritage Expert Committee.A few years ago, he and his students had taken up a pilot of three districts in south Karnataka. Over 550 unprotected structures were identified. These monuments are over 100 years old, and many of these are religious structures under the Muzrai Department, which does not have the expertise for conservation, he said.S.K. Aruni from Indian Council for Historical Research (ICHR) said a majority of these unprotected structures represent hundreds of years of village histories.There needs to be a micro-level documentation of history. But, it needs involvement from the people and the panchayat first. If they can get a preliminary document of the historical structures in the village, then researchers can build upon it, he said.There has been no survey of unprotected monuments since 1942.

5ce5df16e8e3fc56af40fa0a,A tale of two States,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-tale-of-two-states/article25694572.ece,2018-12-08,,The Hindu,"A few farmers sit huddled near a statue of Sardar Patel at Balaguda village in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh pouring out their woes over steaming cups of tea. The statue marks the entry point to the Patidar-dominated village.One of them, Manoj Patidar, who has just returned from the Mandsaur wholesale market, says that the goods and services tax (GST) and rising prices of diesel have made agriculture a loss-making activity. If the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government stays for another five years, we will have to sell our lands, says the tall farmer, his wry smile deepening the lines on his weather-worn face.In another place and State  in Rajasthan  separated by distance as well as priorities, Chhatar Singh Rathore of Tena village in Shergarh tehsil in Jodhpur district has a very different concern.He runs a roadside dhaba on National Highway 114, which connects Jodhpur to Jaisalmer. His main complaint concerns what he believes to be the wilful disregard of Rajput sentiment. Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, who is seeking a second consecutive term in office, he says, has humiliated Rajputs by not backing their opposition to the film Padmaavat , and also marginalising Manvendra Singh, son of former Union Minister Jaswant Singh, who is a Rajput.With not much farming visible in the entire region, caste is the primary marker of social identity, unlike in Madhya Pradesh, where locals display a clear sense of identity as farmers. The contrast between Mandsaur and Shergarh points to the differences between two worlds. While both are rural, one is agrarian and the other is dominated by an array of non-farm activities.On November 30, all eyes were on New Delhi where there was a massive protest by farmers who had gathered from all over the country in the thousands. Opposition leaders such as Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, and CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury spoke. This event came in the wake of another landmark protest held more than a year ago.In the middle of last year, farmers organisations had taken out a rally that touched Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, among other places. The participants also visited Mandsaur, where, a month earlier, five farmers had been killed in police firing. Weighed down by debts, the agitating farmers were demanding loan waivers.As politics heats up in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the Opposition sees farmer anger as having the potential to dent the prospects of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has performed well in most State elections held since it came to power in 2014. The reading is not far off the mark. The BJP scraped through in its stronghold of Gujarat in the 2017 Assembly elections, as a result of urban votes. The Congress, on the other hand, did well in rural Gujarat.However, one was able to get an idea of the situation while travelling through Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan over the last month. In a complex picture, the rural cannot always be conflated with the agrarian.Long list of woesMadhya Pradesh today presents a picture of rural discontent that is cementing an amorphous farmers identity  a sort of occupational consciousness  that the ruling BJP will have to be wary of in the future. But the same does not hold true in Rajasthan, where the rural sector is involved in an array of occupations  from stone mining and animal husbandry to forays into the hospitality sector through highway and city restaurants. There is nothing like a farmers identity across the vast, parched, swathes of Indias largest State by land area.It takes half an hour to reach Pipliya Mandi, the epicentre of last years farm unrest, on the road from Mandsaur to Neemuch town in Madhya Pradesh. Mukesh Patidar, a soyabean farmer in his mid-30s, has come to the mandi (wholesale market) to buy agricultural implements. My village, Chilot Pipliya, which is about 17-18 kilometres from here, saw one farmer become a shaheed (martyr) last year, he says. He adds that soybean farmers are a distressed lot, with a long list of grievances.If the fertilizer DAP (Diammonium Phosphate) cost Rs. 800-900 per 50 kg in 2013-14, it is now priced at Rs. 1,440 for 45 kg, he says. Potash, which was priced at Rs. 450 per 50 kg one-two years ago, now costs Rs. 900 kg, he adds.We use tractors to prepare our fields for the crop. They run on diesel, which has gone up from Rs. 50 a litre to around Rs. 70 a litre, Patidar says. And labour charges have also gone up from Rs. 150-200 to Rs. 300 a day now. Why will they work for less? They are getting grain at Rs. 1-2 a kg.He predicts that the BJP will lose votes in villages around Pipliya Mandi this time. Dilip Patidar, a farm activist who also runs a shop selling various agricultural goods, says the GST has made things difficult for farmers. He says, The GST on pesticide is 28% now. These were taxed at 0-4% earlier. Look at the motor that pumps water to fields. It was taxed at 6% earlier but attracts 12% GST now. The pipe to connect the motor to the fields attracted no tax earlier but attracts 12-18% GST now.All this has made farm inputs dearer. Of the entire area under soyabean cultivation in India, about half is in Madhya Pradesh, the soyabean State of India. The Malwa region, of which Mandsaur is a part, accounts for more than half of M.P.s cultivation of the kharif crop. Fields are prepared by tractor in the summer months. Renting is the norm for small and medium farmers and tractors are rented out for Rs. 700 per hour, up from Rs. 500 because of diesel price hikes. The cost of soyabean seeds, Dilip Patidar says, is Rs. 5,400 per quintal. Labour charges for sowing as well as harvesting have gone up, he adds.Electricity bills too have shot up. While it is possible to run a diesel engine instead of an electric motor to pump water into the fields, with diesel prices going up, it is becoming an expensive proposition now as with diesel becoming more expensive, with costs are Rs. 200 per hour.The soyabean produce is transported to the mandis (wholesale markets) in Pipliya Mandi, Mandsaur and Neemuch. Here again, transportation is more expensive because of the rise in diesel prices. The present minimum support price (MSP) for soyabean is Rs. 3,399 per quintal, but it sells in mandis at Rs. 2,800-3,100 per quintal.In 2013-14, the mandi prices had gone up to Rs. 4,500-5,000 per quintal, says Mukesh Patidar. He blames faulty export-import policies for the fall in prices.Mandi prices keep fluctuating on a demand-and-supply basis, and vary each day. Says a wholesale trader at the Mandsaur Mandi who refuses to be identified, These are like the stock market. It is partly the luck of the farmer and partly his ability to read trends that determine the price he gets for his produce.Look at onions. When prices begin to rise, they import these and the prices fall again, says Dilip Patidar.Indeed, the interests of farmers and consumers are at odds. When the prices of farm produce rise, the commissions of wholesale traders and other intermediaries in the supply chain push up the retail prices of farm produce. When prices fall, food price inflation ceases to be a problem but farmers face losses, rendering agriculture unprofitable as an occupation.For example, at the Ajmer vegetable wholesale market, tomatoes were selling at Rs. 8 a kg. On the previous two days, 1 kg was was selling at Rs. 10 and Rs. 12, respectively. Just 2 km away at the retail market, it was selling at Rs. 20.The dip in farm fortunes is visibly impacting the politics of Madhya Pradesh, a traditional BJP stronghold, with the Congress clawing back in the villages. The troubles of increased documentation, paperwork and bank payments,  seen by many as a part of the formalisation of the sector and cleaning up of the system  have also annoyed farmers.The M.P. government has put in place a subsidy scheme called Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (BBY), under which the government promises to plug the gap between market prices and the minimum support price (MSP). But to avail it, a farmer has to register himself at an authorised office and produce the required documents at the grain and vegetable market when he goes to sell his produce.Says Sunil Solanki, a farmer: Our soyabean crop gets a subsidy of Rs. 500 a quintal. But for this we have to submit a copy of our documents to the mandi merchant, who submits our farmer code numbers to the official market committee and then credits the money to our accounts, a process which takes between 10 and 15 days. The government subsidy under the BBY, he adds, takes two to three months to get credited to a farmers bank account. Unlike farmers elsewhere, farmers in M.P. are not paid in cash as everything is digitised.In other words, say several farmers, they pay in cash for labour, for renting tractors, and to transport the produce, but get paid by bank transfer. The time lag results in a cash crunch. They complain of long queues at markets and banks. Sensing this as an opportunity, Congress leaders have begun to promise cash payments to farmers if voted to power, according to local residents.Economist Utsa Patnaik says that the coming together of farmers across classes  the poor and the rich  was long overdue. She says: There has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. There has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation, and the displaced will be absorbed by industry. The experience of Europe was different. Rather than being absorbed in industry there, the displaced were exported to North America, Australia and South Africa, and they captured the resources there after subduing indigenous people. We dont have that option.She adds: The open trade policies have exposed farmers to the highs and lows of global prices, which they cannot withstand. The meaning of priority sector has also changed under the influence of neoliberal policies, and farmers are unable to access low-interest loans. They have to borrow from private lenders at high interest rates and end up in a debt trap. It is only now that people have begun to notice the farm unrest that was waiting to burst forth.Other sources of incomeFew farmers can be seen at the Ajmer wholesale vegetable market after 11 a.m. They come here at 3 a.m. and leave after selling their produce  in return for cash payments  by 9-10 a.m. The mandi lacks the scale of operations or the frenzied activity of, say, the Surat wholesale market or even Azadpur Mandi in Delhi.The reason is not hard to find. This correspondents journey through Rajasthan, across 2,100 km, covering Jaipur, Tonk, Ajmer, Sawai Madhopur, Nagaur, Pali and Jodhpur districts, showed farm activity present only in the villages close to Tonk.Rasoolpuri village, which has high Gujjar and Meena populations, has farmland where mustard is grown. Here, farmers complain about rising diesel and fertilizer prices and the limited supply of water, which is available only from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. The produce, they say, sells at Rs. 3,200 a quintal, much below the MSP of Rs. 4,200.Farmers at a tea stall just outside the village say they will vote for the Congress as they are fed up of having their concerns brushed aside.But most of rural Rajasthan is a very different world. Villages, even around Jaipur, for miles on end have hardly any farm activity. The better off among villagers have diversified into non-farm activities such as dairy and poultry, while the poor are into animal grazing or work as labourers in construction activities and other sectors.A 40-minute drive on the Jodhpur-Jaisalmer highway leads to the Balesar-Shergarh belt, an arid, sparsely populated area dotted with Rajput-dominated villages. A detour from the highway down a narrow, broken road reveals what substitutes for farming in this region: stone-mining for the construction sector is in full swing on both sides of the road.Meghlasia is a village with Meghwal (Scheduled Caste) and Rajpurohit families. The latter, who describe themselves as gurus of Rajputs, are Brahmins by caste.Stone-mining is a key source of income for the villagers. In addition, they also sow bajra (millet) after the first rains in June-July, but the yield is subject to the vagaries of the monsoon rains.Caste is the markerLike many other Rajputs who have opened restaurants or dhabas because there is not enough water for farming, Chhatar Singh Rathore of the Rajput-dominated Tena village too runs one on the road towards Jodhpur.Says Rathore, Many people in my village run restaurants on the highway. The richer Rajputs also own restaurants in Jodhpur. There are 10 restaurants in the city run by people from my village.He tries to summarise his villages sources of income: Our previous generation saw many people join the Indian Army. You will find many ex-servicemen here. This generation has taken to the restaurant-catering sector in a major way. That apart, many from the village have migrated to Surat to join the cloth industry where they specialise in designing and packing. Some even race horses in Dubai.The Rajput community in the State has gravitated towards the hospitality sector, with heritage hotels and havelis dotting the State. Many are owned by richer Rajput families. They have a traditional feel and visible Rajput markers such as photographs of men in traditional attire holding a sword or rifle. A lot of them try to attract foreign tourists.This non-farm rural world is in sharp contrast to that of M.P., where an occupational identity centred on farming is being forged. In Shergarh tehsil of Jodhpur, caste remains the prominent identity marker, with cultural issues occupying centrestage.Rathore is unhappy with the Rajasthan government for not standing behind Rajputs on the film Padmaavat . He complains that Vasundhara Raje got the entrance to the Raj Mahal Palace in Jaipur sealed to target former royal Diya Kumari, and also humiliated the family of BJP veteran Jaswant Singh.In Tibna village, about 90 km from Jodhpur, water supply poses an acute problem. Sarpanch Bhawani Singh Rathore points to a dry hand pump which is wrapped in a sack cloth. The village has houses placed wide apart, and is populated longitudinally, one house after another for a few kilometres. It has just 300 families, says the sarpanch, of which 150 are Rajput. Other than water, villagers also complain about the lack of school teachers in the local government school. However, despite their various frustrations, they do not think of themselves as aggrieved farmers. Caste remains the key marker of identity and status.You find three types of scenarios, says political analyst and author Sajjan Kumar. The first is Madhya Pradesh, where agriculture is linked to the market, with cash crops such as soyabean and cotton. Here, farming is under stress because of a fall in market prices and the impact of demonetisation. The second is seen in agrarian States such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (excluding western U.P.). Their agriculture is not linked to the market, with mainly food crops such as rice and wheat being produced. An arid State such as Rajasthan presents a third scenario, where agriculture is not central to rural life.He explains the significance of these diverse realities: An occupational identity, where people identify as farmers, is emerging in States of the first kind, such as M.P., Maharashtra and Gujarat. In States such as U.P. and Bihar, while agriculture is central to rural life, caste and religion remain dominant identity markers in the absence of strong market linkages of agriculture. In Rajasthan, in the near absence of agriculture as a key rural vocation, identity markers are still tied to caste.Rathores sentiments lend credence to this hypothesis. I have no problem with [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi. He says we should sell pakodas if we can and I have been doing so at my restaurant, he says. My problem is with Vasundhara Raje. Rajputs will try to ensure a victory for Manvendra Singh at Jhalrapatan. What is a Rajput without self-respect?There has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. There has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation.Utsa Patnaik,Economist"

Herds of elephants have started coming from the Bannarghatta National Park along the Cauvery North Wild Life Sanctuary. The onward movement of the herds will be seen in Hosur forest range along Thally, Jawalagiri, Noganur, Panai, Denkanikottai, Udedurgam and Sanamavu.In its wake, agricultural fields with paddy, corn, tomatoes, ragi, beans, carrots, and sugarcane on the fringes of the reserve forest will face the onslaught of the elephants.However, farmers are told not to venture out in the night to guard their fields. The government provides compensation for crop loss, and hence farmers are cautioned against risking their lives.The department has also warned the public from indulging in chasing the elephants on their own, creating havoc in the midst of the herd and dispersing the herd. Villages along the migratory route of the elephants have also been advised to alert the Forest Department on any sighting of elephants. They can contact forest ranger, Hosur at 98420 85519; forest ranger, Shoolagiri at 94861 82382; forest ranger, Krishnagiri, at 97860 87579, forest ranger, Denkanikottai, at 88259 46041, forest ranger, Jawalagiri, at 84894 82214, and forest ranger, Anchetty, at 94892 87104."

Though August and September witnessed a couple of spells of rain, the officials termed it as untimely.Telling effectWith decrease in the water table, the rabi season has its drawbacks, with the farmers unwilling to take up crops. As against the expectations of officials and farmers as well, the paddy yield turned dismal in about 30,000 hectares and the groundnut crop could survive in just 1,600 hectares, while it is set to perish in about 18,000 hectares.Agriculture Officer (Chittoor) G. Sujatha said that 2018 witnessed 42% deficit rainfall. She said this phenomenon had a telling effect on the overall agriculture scenario in the district.Though the district administration had cherished ambitious plans for the horticulture sector this year, the scenario had presented dismayed results with mango growers receiving a jolt due to delayed flowering and crop cutting. The district administration had to come to their rescue by arranging support price in coordination with the pulp industry.The deficit rainfall in Kuppam region has brought disappointment to the horticulture sector, adversely impacting the rose and grape gardens.The farmers said that unlike the previous years, this year saw prolonged dry spell till the second week of October, taking away the moisture in air.The sugarcane cultivation in the western mandals also took a beating. Though some farmers were persuaded to undertake natural farming to overcome the drought conditions, it was much delayed, and they could only think of the switch next season.The saving grace is that tomato growers in Madanapalle region escaped the wrath of drought by undertaking the cultivation in multiple phases. Much to their happiness, the groundwater table was not alarming till recently."

Read MoreDownload The Times of India News App for Latest CityAHMEDABAD: Our Sabarmati waters are laden with neurotoxic metals, even though municipal sewage and industrial effluent treatment plants claim to have treated the sewage. Its a serious threat to hundreds of farmers in 43 villages downstream of the Sabarmati who use waste waters for growing vegetables and crops.A recent study carried out by the Collaborative Regional Research Programme (CRRP) of the Asia Pacific Network (APN) and the discipline of earth sciences at IIT-Gandhinagar found that copper levels were 7 to 9 times higher than limits set by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). Nickel was found to be 2 to 5 times higher; iron, 4 to 5 times higher; selenium, 4 to 10 times higher; and chromium , 8 to 9 times higher.After the Gujarat government launched its Policy for Reuse of Treated Waste Water in May this year, many STPs across the state are being installed to provide farmers with treated waste water to grow food to meet water demands in stressed areas. A senior Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) official admitted that many of the STPs in the state are not capable of filtering out heavy metals. The ecology research laboratory of the department of botany of the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) had found that heavy metals from treated waste water used for agriculture found they way into vegetables  amaranthus, cabbage, spinach, okra, egg-plant and tomato. The research was carried out by R K Sharma and M Agarwal from BHU and F Marshall from SPRU Freeman Center, Sussex University, the UK.One of the origins of the heavy metal load in urban environment is waste water effluents, said IIT-Gn Professor Manish Kumar who is the lead principal investigator (PI) of the project along with IIT-Gn Scholars Bhagwana Ram, Subhash K Sharma, and Arbind Patel. Kumar went on to say: The extent of its accumulation depends usually on industries in the vicinity and the lack of awareness on unscientific dumping of wastes. One also requires a precise understanding of heavy metal absorption in soil, road dust, and sediment.Kumar said that unlike organic contaminants, heavy metals are non-biodegradable and tend to accumulate in living organisms. There are heavy metal ions that are known to be toxic or carcinogenic, Kumar said. Industrial effluents from tanneries, electroplating , dyeing, metallurgical and paint businesses, and other metal preparing and refining operations contain significant measures of metal particles."
