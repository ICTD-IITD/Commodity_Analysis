He begins stalking her. After a few days of resistance, the girl gives in and Roadsidehas his way.This may be the standard plot of Indian cinemas -- with the audience hooting and cheering the hero on, when he does so -- but few realize the devastating effect it has on women when some brainless desperados start emulating this plot in real life.A 25-year-old woman working as an auditor in a private firm went through a horrendous time when she moved tofrom Berhampur () some nine months back. It started with some unknown persons ringing the bell and running away but soon spiralled into house invasion, spraying of noxious substances and writing love letters with tomato ketchup.So much so that the hapless woman has left the city temporarily and will vacate the house -- where she lives with her brother -- once she returns. Before leaving for her hometown, she filed a complaint with the Madiwala police. A case has been lodged under section 354-D (which deals with punishment for a person who follows a woman and contacts, or attempts to contact, her to foster personal interaction repeatedly despite a clear indication of disinterest) of the Indian Penal Code.The brother-sister duo stay on the second floor of a multi-storied building at Venkatapura, in Madiwala. In his complaint, the brother has said that although his sister moved in with him nine months back, the desperados have been troubling her for the past two months. My sister is traumatised. She has fallen sick after inhaling some noxious spray that the perverts sprayed on her a couple of days ago. I took her home after getting her treated for stomach pain and fever, the brother, who did not wish to be named, told Mirror.The incident that he is referring to took place on May 22 at 10.40 am. While his sister Divya (name changed) was in the washroom, the perverts climbed the building and sprayed some chemical even as they Main Maar Doonga (I will kill) in Hindi. Divya managed to drag herself out of the bathroom and called her friend who stays nearby and her brother who was in office at that time. Her friend reached the house but Divya had bolted it from inside. My sister was not able to get up and open the door. I reached home and managed to get inside to find her very sick. We took her to the hospital and then filed a complaint with the police, her brother said.Divya said she works the night shift and trouble generally starts when her brother leaves for office in the morning. I sleep during the day. For the past two months, somebody had been ringing the bell between 10.30 am and 2 pm. But when I open the door, there would be nobody. The pattern used to repeat every three to four days. But it doesnt happen on Sundays when my brother is home, she added.The brother-sister duo even tried to catch the culprits red-handed, with disastrous, near-fatal results. I had taken my sister out shopping and decided to catch them when we returned home. I stayed back in the opposite building while my sister stood in the corridor outside our main door. Two youths in their mid-twenties appeared and my sister raised an alarm. They pushed her from behind and she almost fell from the corridor but managed to balance herself by holding on to the parapet. I rushed to catch the duo but couldnt find them, he said. After the incident, they approached the Madiwala police who checked the building and suspicious persons around it. When they found nothing, they asked us to call them if we found the miscreants again, he said.He then installed two CCTV cameras in the corridor. But they did not come for at least three days. Then, my sister found a letter in the bathroom; it had love quotes and one-liners written with tomato ketchup. They started dropping letters from bathroom window daily. Once they wrote 2 camera ha ha, he said, adding the quotes were in English, Telugu and Kannada. Next day we got another letter warning us of dire consequences if we complained to the police. After five days, there was a rotten smell in the bathroom; initially, my sister suspected it to be gas leakage or acid cleaning. After a couple of days, she again noticed the putrid smell, he said. We dont know if someone known to us is doing this, but they are observing my sisters movements and targeting her. She is scared it could be black magic too, he added.Madiwala police said they had collected CCTV footage from the building and will nab the miscreants at the earliest.Till then, Divyas nightmare will continue; just like Kirans (played by Juhi Chawla) in Darr."

Hira Singh Vegetable Wholesale Market, locally known as Azadpur mandi, said prices of tomatoes, onions, and potatoes had increased.Disruption in supplyThe vendors said potato stock was influenced the least and the price of onions rose only slightly. However, tomato sellers complained of disruption in supply.Subhas Seti, a tomato vendor for the past 47 years, said while 70 vehicles is the norm, only 12 made deliveries on June 2, the second day of the protest. Other wholesalers had similar experiences.Dashrat Kumar, a vendor at Azadpur mandi for the past 12 years, said the supply of tomatoes was considerably low on June 2. He said the price of tomatoes almost doubled when only five of the usual 50 trucks of produce arrived.Anil Kumar, a tomato seller since 1990, sold his stock for Rs. 15 per kg, Rs. 5 higher than last week, because only four of a total of 40 supply trucks were on duty. When asked about the reason for such few trucks, he said the drivers were worried about local agitation and damage to their vehicles in transit.Vendors sympathiseDespite the disruption in vegetable supplies, many vendors at Azadpur mandi sympathised with the farmers.Although Mohammed Javed, a potato vendor, reported an approximate 10% reduction in stock, he said, The farmers are not getting enough money so it is natural that they will be upset and want to strike.While potato prices have not fluctuated significantly, those working with commission agents, like Javed, have suffered losses. The commission agents responded to the strike by increasing their rate of commission by about Rs. 4 per kg, added Javed and other potato sellers at Azadpur mandi. However, many vegetable retailers in the city did not report any significant price fluctuations. Dinesh Kumar, a retailer in Razapur, said, As of now, there is no change in the rate of tomatoes and onions.Asked about what the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) in Delhi was doing to ameliorate the situation, APMC chairperson Adil Ahmad Khan said, What will the APMC do? Our stock comes from outside, so the Modi government has to listen to the farmers demands.Khan confirmed the high prices of tomatoes and said that rates had almost doubled on June 2 due to the perishable nature of the produce.(With inputs fromUrvashi Sharma)What will the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee do?

Orders are placed online, priced at 32 per person, from a choice of four curries, a vegetarian side dish and naan.Since Sake Dean Mohamed from Patna opened Londons first Indian restaurant called Hindoostane Coffee House in Marylebone in 1810, the Indian food industry has grown exponentially and is worth 4 billion today.It is a different matter that curry in Britain stands for dishes vastly different from what they are known as back home, and at least one Indian dish is a purely British invention: chicken tikka masala or CTM, endowed with the status of national dish by former foreign secretary Robin Cook.CTM, no surprise,is one of the four curries on offer, the others being Lamb Balti, Bangal Naga Chicken and Paneer Korai (veg). The food will be flown to Bordeaux Saucats Airfield, located in the heart of the Pessac-Lognan wine region, where it will be served to customers.James Emery, a France-based British aviation trainer who thought of the idea with Faz Ahmed of Akash, told The Times: Indian food in France is standardised for French tastes and Ive never had anything that resembles what you get in an Indian takeaway in Britain.Its a bit of a hare-brained scheme but we love flying and we love curries and we thought it would get the year off to a good start. Everything is a bit miserable, what with Brexit, and I thought it would be good to have some fun.Orders can only be placed by customers in France, organisers said. The food will be flown to Bordeaux in a Diamond DA42 aircraft operated by Iroise Aro Formation, a flying school in France.The CTM is also proving a major export item from Britain to France. Retailer Marks & Spencer has been reportedly selling ready-to-eat CTM meals at its outlets in Paris by the thousands, making the dish its top selling meal there.CTM may have Indian origins butis reputed to have been invented in 1971 by a cook in Glasgow after a customer complained that his chicken dish was dry. The cook simply poured tomato soup into the dish with some spices, the customer loved it, and CTM was born."

(File)The summit lunch, which brought together 13 principals from both delegations was ""a little unexpected,"" given the early stage of the talks between the two world leaders. (Reuters)The lunch menu for the historic summit involving President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the opulent Capella resort in Singapore suggests both sides got what they wanted from Tuesday's sit-down: concessions, in the form of dishes designed to appeal to both a meat-loving American and a North Korean with more international tastes.The menu should have come with pencils for circling choices. Beneath each course were three oh-so-diplomatic options. Starters featured a prawn cocktail served with avocado salad , a steakhouse staple POTUS would probably be reassured to see; Korean stuffed cucumbers; and green mango kerabu with honey-lime dressing and fresh octopus. Kerabu, a staple of Malay cuisine, is a refreshing salad judged by the balance of sweet, sour, salty and hot notes in the dressing.BBC News reported that the stuffed cucumbers, or oiseon, caused some raised eyebrows among Koreans, given the dish's royal origins. ""It's a bit like the British prime minister sitting down to dine with a visiting dignitary and chowing down on a roasted swan - a favourite of Henry VIII,"" the news outlet declared.Wherever Trump and Asian leaders meet, beef is sure to be in the picture. Over a round of golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last November, hamburgers were served. On a trip to China last year, Trump's hosts seemed to be appealing to his affection for steak with ketchup when he was offered ""stewed beef steak in tomato sauce.""Sure enough, beef, as in short rib confit, was one of three main course selections. The entree was rounded out with steamed broccolini (doctor's orders, maybe, since Trump is said to be dieting?) and potato dauphinois, a fancier way to say potatoes au gratin, a Trump favorite. Both leaders can get around spuds. Kim, who as a teenager studied abroad in Switzerland, is said to have developed a fondness for rosti, the country's famous potato pancakes.In deference to Trump, a teetotaler, the beef's red wine sauce was listed as ""on the side."" (Kim, who has retained both Japanese sushi and Italian pizza makers, reportedly has a fondness for fine French wines.)The alternate entrees were soy-braised cod with Asian vegetables and sweet-and-sour pork with Yangzhou fried rice flavored with XO chile sauce. Was the fried rice a sly way to find a spot for China, North Korea's largest trading partner, at the table? Kim arrived in the city/state aboard a Boeing 747 operated by Air China. Multiple news sources said he brought along some of his own food and even a toilet.Dessert - the course with the power to leave a last impression - was decidedly Western. Choices included a dark chocolate tartlet; the cream- or custard-filled brioche called Tropezienne; and vanilla ice cream with cherry coulis. The scoops came from Haagen-Dazs, the only designer label flagged on the menu. Presumably, Trump didn't get his preferred double helping of ice cream.Video of guests gathering for the lunch shows pre-plated starters on a rectangular table lined down the center with soothing green- and cream-colored flowers. While Singapore was the facilitating host, Trump appeared to take command, asking photographers: ""Getting a good picture everybody? So we look nice and handsome and thin? Perfect.""Getting to ""perfect,"" or close to it, involves teams from both sides identifying the preferences and steering clear of the dislikes of the principals, says Peter Selfridge, who served as U.S. chief of protocol during the last three years of the Obama administration. Reached for comment, the former ambassador said via email, ""At first glance, it looks like rather than having to decide on one main dish that would appease both [palates] - a difficult task under normal conditions - they chose to offer something for everyone, while also giving a nod to the flavors of the host country."" Selfridge called the summit lunch, which brought together 13 principals from both delegations, ""a little unexpected,"" given the early stage of the talks between the two world leaders. Then again, he said, ""sharing a meal goes a long way to breaking the ice."""

Well, he isnt either. For someone who grew up helping his father cultivate wheat and paddy on their 50-acre farm, Satpals transformation into a progressive entrepreneur is remarkable.I made the switch from the wheat-paddy crop cycle in 2014 for better returns. Traditional farming got me Rs 50,000 an acre a year. That works out to be Rs 25-Rs 30 lakh a year, he says as he shows around his six-acre net house farm.Crops are sown in a controlled environment in a net house. Its a farm technique pioneered by Israel and has worked wonders. Satpal says growing cucumber, capsicum and tomato in his six-acre net house fetches him Rs 48-Rs 50 lakh a year. I have given the rest of my land on contract to other farmers so I earn from there also, he says.He among farmers in the state who have benefited from the Centre of Excellence (CoE) for Vegetables at Gharaunda in Karnal, an Indo-Israel project to impart technical knowhow, training and quality seedlings to farmers.Haryana has set up four CoEs under the Indo-Israel partnership, while a floriculture centre is coming up at Sondhi in Jhajjar.Horticulture director Arjun Saini says though the practice of protected cultivation was known, the intervention of Israeli experts helped improve cultivation practices. They taught them how to provide seedlings in a soil-less medium in a green house; the use of drip irrigation; nutrient management; the use of thermal nets; pollination of vegetables inside poly houses; branching and wiring of plants. It improved cultivation in poly/net house in view of the extreme weather conditions, says Saini.Catalysts of change Centre of Excellence for Vegetables, Gharaunda, KarnalEstablished in 2011 to demonstrate latest technology of vegetable cultivation in protected and open conditions. Imparts quality vegetable seedlings and practical training to farmers for protected cultivation.Centre of Excellence for Fruits, Mangiana, SirsaSet up in 2013 to demonstrate the latest technologies of fruits cultivation with different spacing, on flat and raised beds and varietal trials. Crops demonstrated include citrus varieties, olives, pomegranate, date palm varieties, guava and bael.Centre for Sub Tropical Fruits, Ladwa, KurukshetraEstablished in 2016 to demonstrate advanced technologies of horticulture to increase farm income. Crops demonstrated include mango, litchi, guava, peach, plum, olives and pomegranate.Integrated Beekeeping Development Centre, Ramnagar, KurukshetraSet up in 2017, the aim is to demonstrate advanced technologies of beekeeping, bee venom, bee propolis and other byproducts to increase farm income.Floriculture centre, Sondhi, JhajjarApproved. The objective is to demonstrate flower cultivation technologies and production of quality planting material.Satpal says he gets updates from the CoE on new varieties of seedlings and techniques.When I was growing wheat and paddy, I couldnt think of buying a vehicle. Net house farming has given me financial flexibility, he says. Satpal is now setting up a mushroom production unit next to the net house. It will cost me Rs 12 lakh as Ill get Rs 8 lakh as subsidy under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, he says. His elder son, a BTech degree holder, is studying mushroom production to run the project. My second son is studying law. I couldnt have paid for their education had I not made the switch, Satpal adds.Horticulture hubTaking a cue from his friend who grew strawberries, Arun Chauhan, 50, quit his engineering job in 1998 to return to Manouli village and start farming. For years, his family grew wheat and paddy on 30 acres, earning Rs 30,000-Rs 40,000 per acre.Chauhan wanted to do something different. He saw residents of neighbouring Aterna village grow baby corn. A private company guiding farmers there suggested he grow sweet corn. He started with a small chunk. After two years, our produce surpassed expectations, he says. This inspired others. Today my village is called the sweet corn village as every second farmer here grows it. The cost of sowing sweet corn is Rs 20,000 per acre but the returns are from Rs 1 lakh-Rs 2 lakh per acre, he says.Chauhan learned poly house farming from the CoE at Gharaunda in 2008. He set up a poly house on an acre and has now increased it to six acres. The money I get from six acres is four times higher than what I get from the 24 acres I own. I started growing lilies in the poly house and have since shifted to cherry tomatoes and seedless cucumbers. For two years, Im growing red, yellow and green bell peppers, he adds.Chauhan says a poly house set up in an acre gives him 250-300 quintals of bell peppers, which sells for Rs 10-15 lakh. The best is I dont have to go anywhere. Brands such as Dominos and Reliance Fresh come to my village and collect the vegetables, he says. Ive started growing muskmelon after CoE experts suggested a high-yield method. To maintain the poly house, the CoE has suggested we do soil solarisation by mulching and fumigation, he adds.Purchasing powerManchuri resident Surjit Singh is among those who has benefited from the CoE for vegetables. He says net house farming increased his per acre earning from Rs 6 lakh to Rs 8 lakh.I started net house farming on two acres in 2013. Gradually, I increased it to six acres, Singh said. He started growing cucumber, tomato and capsicum and says he has never faced losses despite fluctuating prices.For Surjit and his elder brother, Inderjit, who own 35 acres, life has changed in five years. Their purchasing power has increased and they no longer worry about crop loss and rising input costs. Income from six acres of net house farming is more than the 29 acres under traditional crops, he says. Many farmers have drawn inspiration from our experience and seek our help, he adds.Sandeep Kumar, 36, of Mohindipur in Karnal has also seen his income increase in two years ever since he adopted net-house farming.Sandeep, who shifted from Delhi to Karnal after his land was acquired by the government, says, Initially, I entered into the real estate business but it turned non-profitable in 2014 and I turned to growing vegetables. He started net-house farming on an acre to grow cucumber and capsicum. I earned Rs 6 lakh-Rs 7 lakh from an acre and have since increased the area under net-house farming to three acres, he adds.(Hitender Rao, Hardik Anand and Neeraj Mohan)"

About 28 traders did not participate in the first phase of the process that took place on Tuesday.Acknowledging that the reception among existing traders to relocate their business to the Kallikudi integrated market complex was overwhelming, officials said that around 272 wholesale traders would be moved to the ground floor of the new 9.79 acre facility. Subsequently, in the second phase, the department in coordination with the district administration eyes to relocate another 100 traders from the Gandhi market.We have initiated the process to allot shop numbers and respective blocks to the traders whose applications were selected based on suggestions and inspections by the scrutiny committee that includes city corporation. The response to relocate was good particularly among the English and country vegetables traders, an official with the agriculture marketing department told TOI.The allotment process saw the 272 traders allocated with a shop each across selective blocks of the total 19 blocks in the integrated market. Subsequently, the traders provided with shops through randomisation will be asked to make an agreement with the marketing department to rent the shops for one year tenure.The registration process for identified traders allotted with shops will conclude by June 15 (Friday). Simultaneously, we will take measures to hand over keys to the respective traders, the official added. The stakeholders have asserted that full-fledged relocation of 300 wholesale traders from Gandhi market to integrated market would be initiated after June 15. When the district administration insists us to relocate the shops we have no other go. Traffic woes in Gandhi market may come down to an extent post our relocation, S Jayaraman, a tomato trader allotted with a shop in new market said."

We keep going back to these, bringing it back to our customers, adapting it to suit their palate and new trends, adds Kalra.Despite this emphasis on food, when United Coffee House started, food was not its focal point. It was more of a place to meet and chat  an adda of sorts. As Kalra says, For many, this was a place to walk in on Sundays after listening to the military nand play and watching the fountains at Central Park for a cup of coffee with snacks.Making the right brewEstablished in 1942, it was the brain child of Lala Hans Raj Kalra (Akash Kalras grandfather), the son of a liquor baron who had a flourishing liquor business in Sialkot in Pakistan. The family moved to Delhi and were based in Chandni Chowk.The first foray into hospitality came with the setting up of the Esplanade Restaurant & Bar in 1938-39 to cater to the American GIs who had their barracks at the Red Fort. It proved to be very popular, but since it was meant for the GIs, it wound up with their moving out after the War in the early 40s.Around that time, Hans Raj Kalra heard of an affluent shopping arcade in Lutyens Delhi called Connaught Place, which had been built in the shape of a horse shoe, for luck. What it lacked was a coffee house. He bought the place and opened United Coffee House.In the 40s, the place would be open from 11 am to 8 pm, typically selling street snacks of Old Delhi. Kalra says, Food then was commercial. No one would eat home food outside, so it was only omelette, chana bhatura, tikka...Post-Independence, the hours extended, and by the 60s it became a full-fledged restaurant. The cuisine initially was a mix of the Old Delhi Kayasth food and Frontier Province Pakistani food.The menu expanded, and during their lifetime, the place had served everything from commercial food, bibiyana (homemade) food, Madras club food, Bombay club food, Calcutta club food, Anglo Indian, khansama-cooked memsahib cuisine, to continental food, Asian, Mexican, Lebanese and, of course, Indian.Conceived in the British era, it still holds a fondness for the Old Raj cuisine, especially British club food  cheese balls, cutlets, samosas, chops.On the menuKalra says, We are known for our keema samosa, cheese balls, tomato fish and chicken a la Kiev. These have not been invented by us, but our variation is a huge hit. There are plenty of other staples  chapli kebabs, Railway mutton curry, dak bungalow chicken curry, chicken Maryland, coq au vin, chicken a la princess.Kalra explains, My grandfather had the acumen to get some of the finest cooks of those times to work for us. With their feedback and my grandfathers insight, a dish would be perfected after many trials. For example, a chef from Lucknow might add raw mango and bay leaf to a dak bungalow chicken curry, which made the taste entirely different from the usual one.To commemorate the 75th year, a new menu was unveiled in May. Classic dishes which had not been on the menu for 20-30 years were revamped.Kalra enthusiastically says, Fuyong, chow chows from Asia, buttermilk burgers were on the list. These dishes are being adjusted to suit todays palate. So if a baked salmon was served with boiled vegetables, today we would be doing it with braised bok choi.What works for UCH is that it still retains the old-world charm of the 1950s  the laid-back era of fine dining, huge chandeliers, unhurried knowledgeable waiters, the attention and care to the patrons with a sense of discreet familiarity."

Along the 856km border between them, much of which is fenced, Indian families live outside the barrier, connected with gates manned by the BSF.On Sunday, when Assembly elections will be held in Tripura, these residents will come out of their caged existence to vote. At Jainagar here, 39 Muslim families had their homes on the wrong side when the fence came up nearly 12 years ago. Since then, their movements are restricted by the clock - the gates open at 6am and close at 8.30pm.Along the border, these gates are numbered. At Gate 86, young Sofikul seeks the BSF sentry's permission to come out with his bicycle and head to school. He needs to make a written entry and produce his identity card and a yellow gate pass issued by the BSF.Hasina Khatun, 55, needs to go back home inside the fence, so her name is marked on the register at the gate.She had accompanied her 32-year-old son, Bashir Mia to hospital to treat a deep cut on his palm. Hasina rues having to adhere to gate deadlines; it impinges on her freedom of movement especially when there are family celebrations in town. ""If we are late in returning, we have to spend the night with relatives outside. We appreciate the security, especially with our paddy fields and tomato patches safe from intruders. But it is like living in a cage. On voting day, we will have to leave home early,"" she says.""There is no mosque inside, so we need to come out even for prayers,"" adds Bashir.The opening and closing of these gates is strictly regulated. The BSF sentries deposit the keys at the camp and the procedure to reopen the gates in an emergency involves securing permission from the authorities, the BSF company commander at Konaban in Sipahijala district, Pawan Yadav explains.Having travelled 60km along the fencing, with a lone sentry at each gate, one reaches the Kamalasagar company headquarters of the force. The security on this smuggling-prone stretch is double-layered: area domination patrols by day and ambush-cum-patrol teams at night. At Radhanagar, Abul Kasam Mia, Joydeep Debnath and Dhirendra Debnath stand at the CPM rally kiosk. The sitting MLA looks set to retain his seat here.On reaching Belabor (Gate 92), we find villagers Abdul Majid and Sajal Mia emerging from the gates. Theirs is a piquant situation: their homes are on the Indian side of the gate, but the farmland lies on the other side, so they make multiple entries during the day. At Gate 98 at Motinagar, 400 people live inside the fence. On Sunday, these voters will troop out and head for the nearest booth. ""Our strange existence is not an electoral issue, we have learnt to live with it,"" one of them adds."

(Image used for representational purpose) Onions, which till recently, were trading above the Rs 20 per kg mark, has also started trading below the Rs 10 per kg at most wholesale markets. (Image used for representational purpose)A little over a month since the Union Budget declared a special Operation Green for tomato, onion and potato growers, prices of at least the first two produces seem to be touching an all-time low in the state. With wholesale prices of both the commodities going down to single digits, most farmers are staring at major agrarian distress. In Maharashtra, the wholesale markets of Junnar in Pune and Pimpalgaon in Nashik are major hubs of tomato trade.On Friday, the Pimpalgaons market had recorded the arrival of 695 crates of tomatoes, and the average traded price per crate was Rs 61. With a crate containing 20 kg of tomato, the average price per kg works out to be Rs 3 at the wholesale markets. Similarly, at the Narayangaon wholesale market, 6,330 crates of the produce had arrived, and the average traded price of a crate was Rs 60, which also translates to Rs 3 per kg. Junnar is normally the hub of summer tomatoes, while Pimpalgaon mostly gets the the winter crop.Onions, which till recently, were trading above the Rs 20 per kg mark, has also started trading below the Rs 10 per kg at most wholesale markets. At Lasalgaons wholesale market in Nashiks Niphad taluka, the average traded price of onion was Rs 7.54 per kg, with the market recording the arrival of 15,140 quintals of the bulb. Just about a month ago, onions were trading at Rs 15.50 per kg at this market, a steady fall of over 50 per cent.Maharashtra has seen a 10-15 per cent rise in area under cultivation for both onions and tomatoes. Shriram Ghadhave, president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India (VGAI), attributed this growth to the good rainfall received in the state last year. As against the 2.5 lakh hectares of tomato area, this year, we have about 3 lakh hectares under the crop. Even places like Beed, Aurangabad and Parbhani, which normally do not see cultivation of summer tomatoes, have planted the crop, he said.A similar situation has resulted in the steep price fall in case of onions also. Ghadhave added that inter-state trade has almost stopped with traders from north India absent from the market.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"
