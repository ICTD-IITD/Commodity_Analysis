(Illustration: C R Sasikumar) The country lacks modern storage facilities and the links between processing and organised retailing are very weak. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)The finance minister announced Operation Greens, on the lines of Operation Flood, with a seed capital of Rs 500 crore in his speech on February 1. Three days later, the Prime Minister backed the scheme at a parivartan rally in Bengaluru. He said farmers are his TOP priority  T is for tomatoes, O for onions, and P for potatoes.Operation Flood changed the face of milk production in India, making the country the largest producer of milk in the world  in 2016-2017, the country produced 164 million metric tonnes (MMT). But its important to note that Operation Flood was driven largely by smallholders and the AMUL model has ensured that 75-80 per cent of the price paid by milk consumers goes to the farmers. Operation Greens wants to replicate that success story in fruit and vegetables, starting with tomatoes, onions and potatoes.The main objective of this project, according to the finance ministry, is to reduce price volatility in these commodities, thereby helping farmers augment incomes on a sustainable basis. It also aims to provide these vegetables to consumers at affordable prices. The litmus test of this scheme would be in containing the booms and busts in prices. It will need to avert situations where farmers have been forced to dump potatoes and tomatoes on roads. Also, checking the prices from going through the roof has compelled the government to ban exports. It has resorted to de-stocking and conducted income tax raids on traders  the raids on onion traders in September last year is a case in point.India is the second largest producer of vegetables in the world with about 180 MMT. But China produces four times more vegetables than India. The accompanying graph shows a structural break in Indias vegetable production around 2003-2004. Although not as revolutionary as the Green Revolution in wheat, or the White Revolution in milk, yields of potatoes, onions and tomatoes  which constitute almost half of the countrys vegetable production  have shown a healthy growth. For example, between 2003-2004 and 2017-2018, potato production increased from 28 MMT to 49 MMT while onion yields went up from 6.3 MMT to 21 MMT and tomato production increased from 8.1 MMT to 22 MMT.However, the problem with these commodities is that their prices collapse when their production rises sharply. This is because the country lacks modern storage facilities and the links between processing and organised retailing are very weak. As a result, farmers often end up receiving less than a fourth of what consumers pay in major cities. This must change. Operation Greens needs to ensure that farmers receive at least 60 per cent of what consumers pay. In the case of milk, the producers get more than 75 per cent of what consumers pay. The basic principles of Operation Flood would be useful to operationalise Operation Greens as well.What are these principles? First, link major consumption centres to major production centres with a minimal number of intermediaries. As Verghese Kurien wrote in his book, I too had a Dream, organising farmers and increasing production is an easier job. The real challenge is to find the right markets that can give them remunerative prices on a sustainable basis. So, one needs to map mega consuming centres and link their retail networks with the producing centres of each commodity. Farmers can be organised in farmer producer organisations (FPOs). NABARD and SFAC (Small farmers agribusiness consortium) together have about 3,000 FPOs, which could be the starting points for the aggregation of commodities, assaying, sorting, grading, and even packing with bar codes, reflecting their traceability.The Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act will have to be changed to allow direct buying from FPOs, and giving incentives to these organisations, private companies and NGOs to build back end infrastructure as was done in the case of milk. The announcement of tax concessions to FPOs for five years is a welcome step in that direction, if it encourages building such critical infrastructure.Second is the investment in logistics, starting with modern warehouses, that can minimise wastage. An example is of cold storage for onions, where wastage is reduced to less than 10 per cent, compared to the 25-30 per cent wastage in traditional storage facilities on farmers fields. Such storage facilities have to be cost effective. A potato cold storage in UP, for example, that buys power at almost Rs 10/kwh from SEBs, can become efficient by generating solar power at less than Rs 4/kwh. Large-scale investments in storage will require tweaking of the Essential Commodities Act.Third is linking the processing industry with organised retailing. On an average, about one-fourth of the produce must be processed. India is way behind on this curve compared to most Southeast Asian countries. Dehydrated onions, tomato puree and potato chips should become cheap, so that an average household can use them. Processing industry adds value and absorbs surpluses. Seen this way, the finance ministers announcement of increasing the allocation for the food processing industry by 100 per cent is a welcome step. The food processing ministry will have to coordinate with Operation Greens.By developing such forward and backward linkages, the government can ease large price fluctuations, raise farmers share in the price paid by the consumer and at the same time, ensure lower prices for the consumers  a win-win situation for all.However, Operation Greens would need a champion to implement this vision and strategy with honesty, another Kurien, for at least three to five years. A babu will not work. Can the government locate another Kurien?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Price of sambar onion has fallen from Rs 160/kg to Rs 35/kg since November, while the price of tomato reduced from Rs 20/kg to Rs 8/kg. Traders at the market said that the fall in price will persist for three more weeks till the second crop of the year comes along.Koyambedu vegetables, fruits and flowers traders welfare association president M Thyagarajan , who is a tomato trader, said, Usually, we receive 400-450 loads of vegetables daily. But now we are getting nearly 550 loads. Yield from the first crop of the year (December  January) is usually the highest due to cold weather and availability of excess water. Price of vegetables is set to gradually rise with the arrival of the second crop from February 20.Water-rich vegetables like turnip (nookal), radish (mullangi), chayote (chow chow), beetroot, okra (vendakkai), snake gourd (pudalangai) and white pumpkin (poosanikkai) are now priced at Rs 5- Rs 10. Koyambedu vegetables, fruits and flowers traders welfare association treasurer P G M Sukumar said, Foreign (non-indigenous) vegetables like cabbage, carrot, and capsicum require a greater amount of water to grow as compared to the local varieties. Price of these vegetables has fallen thanks to an excess rainfall.According to traders, the first crop yield is 100kg per acre while second crop (February-March) yield is only 50kg/acre. The wholesale price of vegetables like nookal and mullangi was Rs 5, while their retail price was Rs 10 on Monday.The price of tomato fell gradually since November 2017. Sukumar said, In November, the price of tomato was Rs 20/kg. It fell to Rs 15 in early December and by the end of the month, it was Rs 10. Now the price is Rs 8. Only the price of drumstick (Rs 50- Rs 60/kg) has remained stable since November 2017."

We should be proud of it as it is the only nation that blends many cultures, languages, castes and creed, Sindhu Rajan tells little Samirah while serving breakfast. The plate has chapati, rice, carrot and palak creatively transformed into a tricolour flag and people. Sindhu goes on about the freedom struggle while Samirah interrupts, Mamma, you should get a bigger plate for me. I wanted India Gate too.A mom who is well aware that the surefire way to instil patriotism in children is through the stomach, she cooks up a patriotic storm every Indian Independence Day and Republic Day. As we live in Seattle, Washington, and as she misses the festivities of our country, wherever there is any festival of India, we have food art at home. I narrate her stories related to our country while feeding her. And it never felt like a herculean task, says Sindhu.In Abudhabi, medical professional Sandya Menon too had a similar worry about her children Adithya Anoop and Advaith Anoop missing out on Indian culture. She too decided to go creative on the dining table by way of a solution. Come Republic Day and Independence Day, it is tricolour that is dished out. I keep on experimenting with different cuisines. I believe it is the best way to teach them about their nation and the spirit of Republic Day. And my narration of stories via food begin a week before. As they love sweets, I made tricolour vanilla sponge cake and cupcakes and will follow them up with puddings and pedas, she says.It seems to be a trend for NRIs to celebrate Republic Day with flavoured ideas. Rajeev Maravayal and Sangeetha Rajeev live in Canada and Sangeetha likes to surprise her hubby with a sweet dish on special occasions. On days related to India, I make sure to celebrate it with a special sweet, Sangeetha says. Madagascan vanilla bean cupcake is what she made for Rajeev on Independence Day and today, she is planning to serve a tricolour kesari for breakfast.Parvathy Menon, based in the US, packs such surprises in her better half Kirans lunch box. This time, I am making tiranga pulav using green chilies, tomato puree and rice. I will be serving salads and pickle along with it. I am inspired from my mom Prasanna Menon, she says. Prasannas masterpiece is yard long beans plus Carrot Sabji with Rice, an India special that is a hit with Parvathys friends. It is very simple and healthy as well, she adds.Marketing professional Jyothika Roy, who works in Dubai, rustles up trilicious pasta on such occasions. The word 'tricolour' or 'Tiranga' itself brings a sense of patriotism in all Indians. Indian festivals are always brighter and mightier for us who live outside India. Food plays an important role in such get-togethers. People often enjoy preparing food with the theme of tricolour, she says. For green sauce she has used spinach and the ingredients of white sauce is refined flour, milk and butter and the red Sauce base is of tomato.Tarun Alex from Ranni who is passionate about cooking is on a vacation at Dubai and is planning a South Indian breakfast for his friends, the speciality being tricolour idlis. People living outside their native place are always full of nostalgic feelings. So I thought of nourishing their taste buds with Indian spices and flavours, he says."

This young bio-technologist decided to make use of her degree and knowledge to make a change in the environment for the better.What started as a hobby, soon turned into a profession says Mansi, Due to my mother who has a green thumb even when we were kids we were always inclined towards growing plants and had a mini garden in the balcony. The love for greenery grew and with the help of my dad who has a printing press I decided to incorporate seeds in plain paper which can then grow into plants.Along with paper for gift wrapping, writing, note pads, invites, etc., Mansi also made mud modaks during the Ganapati festival and mud rangoli tiles during Diwali , all infused with paper seeds. And that is how the flags infused with paper seeds too was an idea that she thought of. We were already on a spree to make sure our festivals are green with green modaks and rangolis when I came up with the idea last year in January just before Republic Day. I started thinking about making such a product when I saw a lot of paper flags being made and sold at signals. What upset me though is that we see these same flags being dumped into the trash later that day or the next day. I realised that we as Indians claim to be patriotic in the way of listening to patriotic songs, hoisting our flag, etc., but we dont give a second thought to what happens to those flags post Republic or Independence Day. I realised I can initiate and make some change, so why not. We produced approximately 1000 seed paper flags about a week before Republic Day with the message Dont throw, grow me printed on the back. The idea is to encourage people to grow these flags into plants as opposed to just throwing them out. We made sure its fine to plant a flag and followed the Indian Flag code.The flags are made of handmade paper infused with seeds and the screen print uses vegetable inks. Talking about the seeds that go into the flag, Mansi says, We infuse the paper with a variety of seeds ranging from chilli and marigold to basil, tomato and tulsi. With the flags, in particular, we dont use different seeds for different colours but with other products this can be customised based on the requirement.Mansi remembers how initially when they distributed the flags in a housing society the enthusiasm of the children was infectious, They all made sure their parents, grandparents and friends all planted their flags and that no one threw them out. I have a very special memory of interacting with some children who had no idea what to do with the regular flags once they were done wearing them. On finding out that they could plant our flags they jumped up with excitement and started to enquire how they should plant it, what plant would emerge etc. Seeing their happy, excited reactions was thrilling and I knew that Im on the right path.The interest is ever growing and as compared to last year when Mansi started making paper seed flags to this year the response has been encouraging. Says Mansi, We, are now happy that this Republic Day there are many more flags out there which will grow into little plants and in their little way help preserve nature. And we all must know and realise the fact that there is no Planet B."

Those who braved the early morning chill to head to the Koyambedu wholesale market on Friday, part from of course retail merchants, came away with bagas of vegetables, most of them for a scarcely believable Rs 10 per kg and below.With truckloads of vegetables flooding the market, the cost of vegetables has crashed. Chandran , president of Koyambedu Market Licensed Merchants Association said brinjal, beans, cabbage, ladies finger (okra), broad beans and tomato sold for less than Rs 10 per kilogram.The arrival of trucks with these vegetables has increased by 25% from the average 100 to 125 vehicles. So, this has reflected in a significant drop , he said.While one kilogram of onion cost anything between Rs 30/kg and Rs 40/kg, potato and yam sold for Rs 15/kg to Rs 20/kg and Rs 20/kg to Rs 25/kg.The wholesale market received 450 trucks of vegetables and about 50 vehicles more to meet the demand for Pongal from different parts of Tamil Nadu , Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka The situation in the retail markets, however, was different, with residents in many areas saying prices were much higher.Responding to this, Chandran said retail traders would factor in a minimum a profit margin of Rs 10 for every kilogram of vegetables to meet the expenses incurred in transporting the goods to respective places."

Telegraph pictureAgartala: Surrounded on three sides by Bangladesh, the tiny state of Tripura is almost like an enclave. Along the 856km border between them, much of which is fenced, Indian families live outside the barrier, connected with gates manned by the BSF.On Sunday, when Assembly elections will be held in Tripura, these residents will come out of their caged existence to cast their ballots. At Jainagar here, 39 Muslim families had their homes on the wrong side when the fence came up nearly 12 years ago. Since then, their movements are restricted by the clock - the gates open at 6am and close at 8.30pm.Along the border, these gates are numbered. At Gate 86, young Sofikul seeks the BSF sentry's permission to come out with his bicycle and head to school. He needs to make a written entry and produce his identity card and a yellow gate pass issued by the BSF.Hasina Khatun, 55, needs to go back home inside the fence, so her name is marked on the register at the gate.She had accompanied her 32-year-old son, Bashir Mia to hospital to treat a deep cut on his palm. Hasina rues having to adhere to gate deadlines; it impinges on her freedom of movement especially when there are family celebrations in town. ""If we are late in returning, we have to spend the night with relatives outside. We appreciate the security, especially with our paddy fields and tomato patches safe from intruders. But it is like living in a cage. On voting day, we will have to leave home early,"" she says.""There is no mosque inside, so we need to come out even for prayers,"" adds Bashir.The opening and closing of these gates is strictly regulated. The BSF sentries deposit the keys at the camp and the procedure to reopen the gates in an emergency involves securing permission from the authorities, the BSF company commander at Konaban in Sipahijala district, Pawan Yadav explains.Having travelled 60km along the fencing, with a lone sentry at each gate, one reaches the Kamalasagar company headquarters of the force. The security on this smuggling-prone stretch is double-layered: area domination patrols by day and ambush-cum-patrol teams at night. At Radhanagar, Abul Kasam Mia, Joydeep Debnath and Dhirendra Debnath stand at the CPM rally kiosk. The sitting MLA, Narayan Chandra Chowdhury, looks set to retain his seat here.On reaching Belabor (Gate 92), we find villagers Abdul Majid and Sajal Mia emerging from the gates. Theirs is a piquant situation: their homes are on the Indian side of the gate, but the farmland lies on the other side, so they make multiple entries during the day. At Gate 98 at Motinagar, 400 people live inside the fence.On Sunday, these voters will troop out and head for the nearest booth, the village barely discernible from the border road.

""Each cluster would be of 50 acres and all the farmers who would be owners of the land would become part of the group that would undertake the zero budget farming,"" said agriculture minister Prem Kumar.An agriculture department official said that under the scheme farmers would be encouraged to use local products like dung of local breed of cows, their urine, gram flour and jaggery for making fertilisers that would reduce their input cost drastically and also increase productivity.""It would save around Rs 20,000 per acre cost in case of tomato cultivation whereas the savings would be around Rs 18,000 on input cost that goes in fertilisers and pesticides for cultivating chilli on one acre of land,"" he said, citing examples.The scheme includes training the farmers, providing inputs for preparing the fertiliser and also providing them services of agencies empanelled with the National Council of Organic Farming (NCOF) that would do the branding and marketing of the produce.While Rs 10 lakh would be spent per cluster on training and other input costs, Rs 4.95 lakh would be spent on branding and marketing of the produce and finance.The agriculture department will handhold work on each cluster for three years and a company of the group of farmers who own the cluster land will be formed to market the produce.The participatory guarantee system (PGS) system will be used to certify the produce of such farming. The details of the produce will be on the portal of the NCOF to ensure transparency.""We are hoping to come up with first lot of agricultural produce in the month of April and to begin with most of the products would be from horticulture sector,"" the agriculture official said.""Later, the same method would be promoted for farming of cereals as well."""

Later, the BJP members joined the protest.Unable to run the House, the Speaker adjourned the proceedings twice till afternoon.Leader of Opposition Narasingha Mishra urged the Speaker to adjourn the House immediately and convene an all party meet to find the way out. Mishra was supported by BJP Legislature Party leader K.V. Singh Deo.""The problem of distress sale be sorted out on priority basis,"" he said."

The details of the produce will be on the portal of the NCOF to ensure transparency.""We are hoping to come up with first lot of agricultural produce in the month of April and to begin with most of the products would be from horticulture sector,"" the agriculture official said.""Later, the same method would be promoted for farming of cereals as well."""

But there is an unlikely candidate this time, mangoes. Several factors seem to have ganged up to create such a situation.The APMC yard here has turned into a virtual trash bin as the fruits are rotting, but there are hardly any buyers. The furious growers are throwing the mangoes into the drains and on the roads. Among the reasons for the price crash are excess production and fall in demand from the middlemen.The rates have fallen to as little as Rs 10-12 a kilo for the Badami variety. The other varieties of mangoes are priced at Rs 4-5 a kg, down from Rs 100 a few days ago.Varieties like Sendur, Rasapuri and Neelam have no takers. Buyers purchased 240 quintals of Badami mangoes at Rs 900 to Rs 1,000 per quintal. Other varieties (740 quintals) sold at Rs 500-600 per quintal. Even tomato is commanding a better price than mangoes, say the growers.Many lorry loads of mango are returning to the market as some buyers are sending them back due to excesssupply. Earlier, these buyers, mostly juice producers, used to fall over each other to buy both ripe and raw mangoes. However, this time, the buyers are imposing conditions on what they want.Nipah scareThe scare of the spread of Nipah virus through mangoes has discouraged retail consumers from buying them and so, the demand has crashed. Besides, there is a glut in production in Kolar, another major production centre.Many growers have left the mangoes to rot on the trees as they dont want to spend on the labour for plucking in the current situation."
5b2e78bc9855b72640115dac,Farm crisis real but can be tackled,http://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/farm-crisis-real-can-be-tackled-667754.html,2018-05-02,"One of the oldest civilisations, the Indus Valley civilisation, vanished because of persistent drought. This is a stark reminder to policymakers that they will have to tackle persistent drought in parts of the country failing which civilisation could disappear in a couple of centuries. Farm crisis in India is real, particularly in states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which is going to witness yet another drought this year despite good monsoon forecast for the third consecutive year in the rest of the country.This is one side of the coin but Agriculture Secretary S K Pattanayak, a Karnataka cadre IAS officer, argues that all is not bad with Indian agriculture. It has come a long way and this year India is going to have a bumper crop with food grain production touching a record 275 million tonnes, while horticulture, including fruits and vegetables, will produce a record additional 300 million tonnes. Also, the country has had a record bumper harvest of 23.6 million tonnes in pulses, the only source of protein to the vast vegetarian population.But the stark reality is that farming is the livelihood for half of the 1.25 billion people of India. A farmer must get a remunerative price and adequate income. Already next generation of farmers are moving away from farming and this could have a catastrophic effect on who will feed the 125 crore people, which is not a small number. Also, if the Indian economy has to clock a double-digit growth on a sustained basis, the farm sector has to grow by at least 4% annually on a continuous basis, which has not happened so far. This is necessary to ensure poverty is eradicated.For the woes of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu farmers, Pattanayak said they should change their cropping pattern from water-guzzling crops like paddy and sugarcane and switch over to drip irrigation, which will reduce water consumption drastically. It is a crime to cultivate sugarcane in Maharashtra. Sugarcane should be cultivated in flood-prone areas of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and perhaps the Northeast as it could also be flood protected.Punjab should not be cultivating basmati rice. The practice of which has brought down the water table to a dangerous level. Israel, which has a mere 300 mm of average rainfall, did not find water shortage a major problem and its farm yield is one of the highest. India gets bountiful rainfall and perhaps one of the few countries to have monsoon as a season every year.Even in the arid zones of Rajasthan and Karnataka, the average rainfall is around 800 mm, which is more than double that of Israel. All one has to do is harness this through rainwater harvesting so that fresh water does not go unutilised into the sea. The government, therefore, is rightly giving priority to minor irrigation and desilting of all the existing tanks, besides immediately taking up 99 stalled irrigation projects. This has to be done on a war footing.What is needed now is to make agriculture smart, which has not happened so far in India despite the Green Revolution that only ensured there are no more starvation deaths. Farmers income needs to be not only doubled but at least quadrupled from the present level of Rs 20,000 annually. One way could be to provide income support as in the US instead of price support by way of Minimum Support Price (MSP). Because of high MSP for certain crops like food grains, rich farmers grow these crops to take advantage of procurement as only they have a marketable surplus.The top 10% of Indian farmers produce 60-70% of marketable surplus in food grains. The remaining 90% have only 30% of marketable surplus and hence they get very little benefit from the price support system. The resulting depression of prices for poor farmers in the market leads to distress sale of the small quantity they produce.If income support is given instead, market forces will come into play and the farmer can produce any crop that the market demands and not only those that have price support, which leads to excess production and subsequent depression of prices. This will also ensure that crop failures do not hit farmers hard.If farmers income has to rise, the dependence only on agriculture for income has to change and farmers will have to take to animal husbandry, poultry, fisheries, food processing and other agri-related rural industries and so on for augmenting income. This is because farming by its very nature is seasonal and hence there is disguised unemployment even in the best of times.As the Swaminathan Committee has pointed out, market access to poor farmers is a major problem in India. Bumper tomato crop forces a farmer to sell it at Re 1 per kg but in the retail market, it is not available for less than Rs 20. But Re 1 does not cover even the cost of production. A farmer gets Rs 6 per coconut but in the retail market, it is not available for less than Rs 40. Who then gets the benefit? It is neither the farmer nor the consumer but the rich middlemen.So what is the way out? An Amul like cooperative model that brought about the White Revolution has to be replicated for all crops so that farmers get a remunerative price and the food products are marketed better and exported. The wastage of fruit, vegetables and other crops running into thousands of crores can be minimised. This will facilitate setting up of common cold storage for horticulture produce in areas where they are grown.Amul like cooperatives will also ensure crop insurance, better quality seeds, pesticides and other inputs, thereby minimising crop failures and loss of farm income.--(The writer is a senior journalist based in New Delhi)"
5b2e79c29855b72640115de5,Combating cancer: nature holds key,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/657388/combating-cancer-nature-holds-key.html,2018-02-07,"Despite a consistently growing quantum of research on the origin, surveillance and treatment of cancer and massive spending globally, only 70% of those living with this dreaded disease survive five years from its onset. The bulk of treatment methods viz. chemotherapy, radiation and surgery, involve much pain and severe side effects.Newer, less toxic and less painful therapies have brought significant relief in managing cancers and some decline in mortality due to cancer has been recorded in a few developed countries (US, Denmark, Sweden and Slovakia) as per a study published in The Lancet. Yet, overall, it remains a serious health threat worldwideGlobally, over 7 million deaths occur due to cancer yearly. In 2016, $113 billion was spent on therapeutic and supportive care of those living with the disease, a figure projected to grow to $147 billion by 2021.In lay terms, cancer is the attrition of healthy cells due to loss of activity over time. Only those body parts and organs that remain active maintain blood flow essential to stay healthy; this purpose is served by regular exercise prescribed for fitness. Sedentary living is known to raise cancer risk especially that of colon or lung or among men and endometrial and breast cancer among women.""Physical activity: even if you don't lose an ounce, you'll live longer, feel healthier and be less likely to get cancer, heart disease, stroke and arthritis. It's the closest thing we have to a wonder drug,"" says Tom Frieden, former director, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Further, acknowledging the limited success of medications, health experts now advise integrated approach including exercise, yoga, vegetarian diet and psychological wellbeing for cancer and other ailments. After positive outcomes from multi-location studies, intake of antioxidant-rich lemon, ginger, turmeric, cucumber, ever part of Indian cuisine, is being advocated for prevention and treatment of cancers.Lab trials at Georgia State University have shown a 10,000 times superior efficacy of ginger and turmeric vis--vis chemotherapy in cancer. Advising reduced intake of non-veg foods, the American Institute for Cancer Research recommends no more than one-third of animal protein in daily diet.Lab studies have also shown efficacy of folate-rich vegetables and fruit, particularly the deep coloured ones which contain cancer-fighting nutrients and help maintain body weight. These include beans, sunflower seeds, green leafy vegetables,green tea, cabbages and tomato and berries. Adequate intake of water and other fluids that dilute toxic concentration of cancer-causing agents in the bladder is also recommended.What makes cancer management tough is the erratic movement of cancer cells and their rapid growth that follows no pre-determined pattern and transmits to other body parts damaging the normal cells. Second, most cases are detected in later stages due to the lack of awareness among people; many women ignore the problem and approach the surgeon only when a tumour has stretched 8-10 cm long.To provide affordable and equitable care, public awareness on cancer along with expanding screening centres needs to be our top priority, says Dr Anand Purushotham, director at King's Health Partners Comprehensive Care Centre. The third handicap in most developing countries is the resource crunch. ""India is spending less than half of what it should be doing on cancer care,"" regrets Dr Anand.Once diagnosed with cancer, those around the patient tend to socially ostracise him/her unfairly at times. Ironically, however, this is a phase when one needs greater moral and other kinds support to accept the condition and pass their remaining days with minimal stress and peace.A patient should be impressed upon, as CC Scott said, that the human spirit is stronger than anything that can happen to it. Small gestures like the presence of loved ones and normal conversations, delivering meals, accompanying the patient to a healthcare facility, supplying essentials, keeping them updated with events and involving them in activities of their liking can trigger positive vibes and facilitate recovery.People diagnosed with cancer should be treated the usual way, with just a little extra love so that they do not lose their morale to fight back against the disease. As Michael Landon, the American writer, stage artist, director and producer said before he died of pancreatic cancer in 1991, ""I'm going to beat this cancer or die trying."""
