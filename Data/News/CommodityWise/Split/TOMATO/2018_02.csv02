We chop the prawn, saute and mix it with mashed potatoes before rolling it as patishapta.Ghoti delicacies include Dal Raibahadur and Ghoti murgi while bangal ones include Chitol Kalia and Sorshe Roopchada. Even dishes like shuko will be given a Bangal tinge. Their version is less bitter, more spicy and more dry than the ones people here are used to, says general manager Sumanta Maity.Pocket pinch: Rs 999Restospeak: Our hotel is nearly two years old and our peak season is from October to February. But we had robust footfall last Poila Baisakh, says Maity. Also, we realised that people came the day after too.

So while Spinach Tortellini, a ring-shaped pasta, uses mascarpone cheese sauce, its base is the ever-familiar lal shak with panch phoron. Fish gets prominence in any Bengali festival so we have items like Fish Pie and Fish Ravioli, which is smoked bekti in tangy tomato and kasundi sauce, says head chef Debasish Paul.But the star dish is the Grilled Baby Bhetki, thats seasoned, pan friend, topped with nichoise sauce and placed on a bed of pesto pearl barley risotto. This dish is for mach-bhat lovers. But we since we replace the rice with barley and go easy on the spices, its healthier, says the chef.Pocket pinch: Spinach Tortellini is Rs 236, Grilled Baby Bhetki Rs 394Restospeak: Tastes are changing these days and so we think diners would like to try new options this festive season, said one of the owners Sarika Agarwal.A sweet platter at Fern Residency.

The east-west balance is there in every course. With Dhonepatar Bora there is Dimer Devil among the alternatives in the starters, with Murighonto-Bhaat there is Mishti Pulao, with Kharkolbata there is Lalshaak, with Phulkopir Rosa there is Dhokar Dalna and with Jirebata diye Shukto there is Jamidarbarir Shukto.

So if you feel like exploring how the occasion is celebrated in gods own country, head to the Vishu food festival at GD Blocks Kurry n Kebab.Onam and Vishu are the most important festivals of the state, says Rajesh Menon, a Malayali who is a partner at Kurry n Kebab. And food is an important part of it. So expect a thali, served on banana leaf, with more than 20 dishes.The staff will be staying over at the restaurant the previous night, in preparation. At 4am we shall bathe, don new dhoti-kurtas, pray and then cook, smiles K. Surendran Nair, the sweet 72-year-old Malayali head chef.Any auspicious occasion in Kerala is strictly vegetarian but you wont miss mutton as you dig into Aviyal (made of papaya, chal kumro, and coconut), Kootu Curry (made of channa, kachkolka, ol and carrots) and Pachadi (a tangy mixed vegetable curry).Since the meal is served on a banana leaf, most items are dry or have a thick gravy. Its just sambar, rassam and a Moong Dal preparation that are watery and will be served on the rice. The chef adds that the Moong Dal preparation is one of the toughest on his list. It uses jaggery and coconut milk and takes two hours to make, he says.Menons personal favourite is the tangy Mambazha mango curry, made of curd, coconut and chilli.The Rs 400 thali will be a lunch-only affair, as is the custom in the southern state, and prior reservations is a must. This part of town has many Malayalis working in the IT sector or studying in institutes like NUJS. They have been making bookings but for Onam we had more Bengalis. Lets see what happens this time, smiles Menon."

(Prithwish Karforma)Who says gardening is a post-retirement hobby? Abhishek Banerjee, a young IT sector employee, is as passionate about plants as he is about rock and reggae and has in fact done up his garden thematically to gel with his taste in music. So Marigolds and Dahlias keep posters of Bob Marley and Pink Floyd company on his terrace.Our garden is inspired by the shacks of Goa. While the basic design is mine, everyone at home contributes.So if I guided the labourers to paint the terrace borders in Rastafarian colours of green, gold and red, my brother Atreyo put up band posters. My mother got cacti from Kalimpong and my father designed a barbecue set to have parties up there. And yes, my daughter waters the plants.Right now the garden is full of seasonal flowers like Marigolds, Snowballs and Petunias. On my mothers birthday this January she had received some Gladioli. We got them grafted and now they are growing in a pot too.As the heat sets in, well have to return to Hibiscus, Bougainvillea, Togor and Jasmine. We also have some 9 oclock flowers that bloom at 9pm and fade away by dawn. The garden produce 50-60 flowers a day in summer but one never sees them in the garden as they get offered for puja.This winter, we relished a homegrown Gourd and the Broad Beans (Sheem) are nearly ready too. Our Tomato plant would bear lots of vegetables but we couldnt eat a single one. Turns out that squirrels would run up a Radhachura tree on our pavement, hop over to our terrace and gorge away on the tomatoes.One of the decors in our garden is an abstract tree that I have painted on the wall. Theres much to learn from trees, especially how its roots, leaves, branches work together to provide for one another. To me, a tree symbolises the ideal family.As told to Brinda SarkarIf you have a garden you are proud of and tend to yourself, send your contact number to The Telegraph Salt Lake, 6, Prafulla Sarkar Street, Calcutta 700001 or call 22600115 after 4pm or email to saltlake@abpmail.com"

However the peasantry, which has suffered heavily due to successive droughts and farm commodity price crash in the state, feels let down as the Budget has no initiative to offer relief from the debt burden.Kuruburu Shanthakumar, president of State Farmers Federation, had expected categorical commitment from the Modi government on implementing the Swaminathan Committee report, which Modi had promised to implement within 100 days of coming to power. However, he welcomed the Budget proposal to raise the minimum support price (MSP) of agricultural commodities to 1.5 times the production cost.The proposal is also to extend the MSP scheme to all the 89 crops. It was earlier restricted to 43. He also welcome Kisan credit cards extension to all farmers.Shanthakumar told The New Indian Express that declaring 100 per cent tax exemption for five years for farm produce firms being formed by the farmers is a positive move.Though the Budget has assured huge expansion of crop insurance scheme under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, the scheme itself suffers from many flaws. It needs to be revamped by making a village or farmers the basic unit of reference to pay the compensation instead of the present basic unit of a hobli or gram panchayat.I will give this budget 5 marks on a scale of 10 for the farm sector and will ramp it up to 7 if effective measures are taken to implement the proposals in the remaining one of the Modi government, Shantakumar said.On allocating Rs 500 crore for farmers who grow perishable commodities like potato, tomato and onion, horticulture expert S V Hittalamani said in Karnataka there are some saline agriculture belt which cannot be used for agriculture purposes.However, agriculture experts feel the budget does not help farmers. Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha president Kodihalli Chandrashekar said the budget outlay for agri sector is Rs 11,000 crore. How much of it actually goes to farmers? Whatever money is announced is for the seeds, fertiliser, manure and other facilities. Budget does not speak about loan waiver, he said.He further added that if the Centre can bear Rs 2 lakh crore to implement the 7th pay commission report, why cannot they waive the loan of farmers who are the backbone of the nation."

Initially, AP was synonymous with drought and cyclones. Continuous efforts in the last four years have showcased our resources and strength in various fields and now I am sure the State will register more progress with team spirit, he said, while underscoring the need for more coordination between officials and employees.On the second and final day of the Collectors Conference at his residence in Undavalli on Wednesday, the Chief Minister surprised the officials by describing himself as a team leader and coordinator. Stating that AP has put up a phenomenal performance and displayed excellent leadership, he said the credit for the achievements of the State goes to all.After overcoming all odds initially, we are entering the next level and it is time for all of us to work with more coordination, he said.Explaining about his conversation with former British prime minister Tony Blair as well as the prominent architect Norman Foster, he said on Monday Foster landed in Vijayawada to have a chat with him, while he was en route to Odisha. But, as I am preoccupied with a series of conferences like the Finance Ministers conclave, review meetings and the rally condemning the brutal assaults on girls and women, I could not meet him. After understanding that he could not meet me despite landing here on my own request, Foster decided to go to Odisha. But, after receiving proper information, I not only met him but also dropped him at the airport and had a conversation with him, he said.Naidu said he does not have any individual relationship with Foster. I met him as he is a great architect. In case I did not meet him personally, it would have sent a negative signal about our State at a time when we are in need of support of world-class architects for building Amaravati as one of the worlds best cities, he said.CS makes critical observationChief Secretary Dinesh Kumar pointed out that there will be no use except forcing the closure of the existing industries by allowing more cashew processing industries in Srikakulam district. When Srikakulam District Collector Dhanunjay Reddy sought more cashew processing units, the Chief Secretary said excess processing units are not needed for cashew.Industries Minister N Amarnath Reddy intervened and said that setting up of more processing units will generate employment. But, the Chief Secretary said that more units than the cashew production capacity will only force closure of the existing units.We can understand that there is immediate need for setting up processing units for tomato as the growers in Chittoor district are suffering losses. But, setting up more units for cashew is no way needed, the Chief Secretary said. However, the Chief Minister suggested to the Industries department to take note of the suggestions of both CS and the Minister."
5b2f56b09855b70eb7de7fdf,TDP may go it alone in 2019 elections,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/andhra-pradesh/2018/may/28/tdp-may-go-it-alone-in-2019-elections-1820297.html,2018-05-28,"S Viswanath ByExpress News ServiceVIJAYAWADA: Will the TDP go it alone in the 2019 polls? Though, some leaders feel it is premature to discuss alliances as there is one more year for elections, others opine that it is better for the TDP to prepare to fight alone. At present, the principal opposition YSRC and the BJP have turned bitter rivals of the TDP. Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan, who stood by the TDP-BJP alliance in 2014 polls, too, is targeting the ruling party and Left parties blame the Naidu government for being equally responsible along with the saffron party for the injustice meted out to the State. Despite Chandrababu Naidus recent meeting with the national leaders of Left parties in Bengaluru, TDP leaders are not sure whether any alliance with CPI and CPM will benefit it or not and they are also not sure on their stand on alliance as they are already sailing with Jana Sena.Against this backdrop, TDP leaders are of the view that they should be prepared to face elections alone instead of depending on alliances. In a brief interaction with TNIE at the venue of Mahanadu, several senior leaders opined that despite the fact that satisfaction levels among people have increased and the CM is confident of retaining power, they will have to be very cautious as there is possibility of all the opposition parties targeting the TDP.A senior leader said the TDPs decision to snap ties with the BJP and leave the NDA government at the Centre helped the party in shifting the blame for States woes to the Centre. If we continued our relations with the saffron party till elections, we may have suffered a lot in the upcoming elections. But, now, by organising a series of programmes, we are hopeful that the people will not bear no more grudge against the State government and, instead, find the BJP and the opposition parties, which are dancing to the tunes of the Centre, as villains, a senior leader said.A leader from North Coastal Andhra explained that at one stage opposition parties managed to convince the people about the guilt of the ruling party in not achieving special category status (SCS) in spite of being an ally of the NDA, by making a big issue out of it. But, after the TDP made the SCS as its main demand and left the NDA, they to some extent understood the TDPs position and its sincere efforts. We are hopeful the people will stand by us without being carried away by the rants of opposition parties. Minister Kalava Srinivasulu said at present the party was concentrating on strengthening its position in the State and will think of political tie-ups only before elections.Mahanadu SidelightsAccording to the 2017-18 fiscal status report of the TDP, which was submitted by party state treasurer and MLA Sidda Raghava Rao, the party has properties with a net worth of J104.15 crore. Its net income in the previous fiscal was J19.40 crore, while the expenditure stood at J16.73 crore. Of the total expenditure, J6.38 crore was spent on publicity, Raghava Rao said. It maybe recalled that a report published by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), last week, said that TDP had the second highest income (in 2016-17 fiscal) among the regional parties after Samajwadi Party. According the the report, TDPs 2016-17 income was J72.9 crore.Heavy traffic jam was witnessed between Benz Circle and VR Siddhartha Engineering College in Kanuru between 9.30 am and 11 am. Even though city police and TDP volunteers were deployed, thousands of vehicles ferrying TDP workers to the venue of Mahanadu sent the traffic for a toss. Beside, indiscriminate parking of two-wheelers and four-wheelers on the road added to the chaos.The first-ever Mahanadu, an idea conceived and implemented by TDP founder the late N T Rama Rao, was held in Vijayawada in 1983 in the 200 acres where Kamineni Nagar, Ganesh Colony, Sri Ramachandra Colony and others have come up now. Mahanadu Road opposite Dr NTR University of Health Sciences, leading to Autonagar has got its name after it was laid to facilitate the movement of vehicles for the first TDP conclave. Two more conclaves were held in the subsequent years. The Mahanadu, which kicked off on Sunday, is the first one since the State bifurcation.Ravva kesari, idly, mysore bonda, tomato bath, tea and coffee were served to the party workers as breakfastw. For lunch, about 20 varieties including apple halwa, Madras pakodi, vegetable biryani, kadai vegetable curry, dondakaya fry, mamidiyaka-aakura pappu, mulakaya-tomato curry, stuffed brinjal were spread out. At 3 pm, snacks were also given. On Monday, which also marks the birthday anniversary of TDP founder NTR, more than 20 varieties of food times, favourites of the late leader, will be served at the venue, according to TDP leaders.The party has put up the model of interlinking of Krishna and Godavari rivers through Pattiseema Lift Irrigation Project at the dais of the venue. The previous Mahanadu held in Visakhapatnam had the models of Polavaram project and Cyber Towers on either side of the dais.Speaking about elections, Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu stressed the need for studying Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs). Technology is always vulnerable to defects. Since we vote only once in five years, we dont have much knowledge of how EVMs work. So, there is a need to create awareness, he said and recalled that he was instrumental in ensuring Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) system along with EVMs.At the blood donation camp, close to 220 TDP workers donated blood. Meanwhile, TDP MP Murali Mohan and K Raghu Ramakrishnam Raju donated Rs 5 lakhs and Rs 20 lakhs respectively for the party welfare."

I leased a unit and processed fruit. In spite of the initial loss suffered due to lack of quality consciousness among the stakeholders, I went ahead with export. Today, there are 6,200 farmer producers with me, whose net realised value has touched 200%, Mr. Abdul Ali told The Hindu .FPOs distinctionToday, this is the second largest horticultural Farmer Producer Organisation (FPO) in the country, next only to a grape-based unit in Nashik (Maharashtra), he said.After tasting success in mango, Mr. Ali decided to replicate the Nashik example and brought exotic varieties such as seedless grape, pineapple, dragon fruit, grapefruit (a citric variety), passion fruit, and Italian tomato to ensure higher margins for the farmers.We have designed an ERP system to schedule cropping pattern to balance demand-supply, which our farmers are following, Mr. Ali added. This FPO also owns a fertilizer shop that runs on zero margin, thus saving 30% for the stakeholder farmers.Processing unitNow, the FPO is all set to launch a huge processing unit to handle 500 tonnes a day, an IQF facility to make frozen foods, a cold storage that can handle 2,000 tonnes, and pack houses to handle 50 tonnes per day.The profit will be shared among all the shareholders, he said, hoping the unit will come into operation next year."

Of the targeted 1.34 lakh hectares, only 90,000 hectares went for groundnut sowing during the Khariff season, of which less than 40,000 hectares saw harvesting. For the ongoing Rabi crop, the groundnut acreage dipped by about 80%.Paddy too fared badly, with even the eastern mandals that are known for their success stories doing poorly this year due to a prolonged dry spell. Though the target was set at 42,000 hectares in the eastern mandals, the acreage plummeted to half, with low yields.Sugarcane farming received a big jolt in the district due to adverse climate. Generally, the district used to have sugarcane farming in about one lakh hectares, but in 2018 it slipped to below 20,000 hectares. With closure of two cooperative sugar factories and non-remunerative prices for the tonnage, a majority of the farmers resorted to growing alternate crops.Tomato fares betterThe tomato sector fared slightly better, with profits being reported in August and September which took the pressure off an otherwise bleak year that saw yields staying low. During peak season, the Madanapalle tomato market yard receives stocks to the tune of 1,200 metric tonnes per day, with transactions crossing over Rs. 1.5 crore a day. However, the daily arrivals fell below 250 tonnes a day this year.Host of issuesOther predominant issues faced by the farmers this year were an unprecedented shortage of farm workers and a failure of alternative and intercrops. Some small-scale farmers reportedly took up NREGA works and temporarily migrated to Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to make a living as workers in the construction industry.Joint Director of Agriculture Vijay Kumar admitted that the year was disappointing. The major problem was the minus 48% deficit rainfall in the district. However, we are happy that farmers slowly switched over to natural farming. We have reached a target of 1.59 lakh hectares in acreage. As the declaration of drought mandals took place early in June and July, it helped several farmers stay away from their fields or going in for alternative crops, he said."
