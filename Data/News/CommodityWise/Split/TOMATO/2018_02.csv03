The words describe this festival perfectly and the celebrations are in full swing in my house. The Christmas tree is up with blingy lights and lots of gifts are waiting to be unwrapped. At school, the kids are learning a new carol every day and belting it out proudly at the top of their voices just when I need a moment of peace. And, yes, most importantly, the mistletoe is ready for some loving kisses! For me, Christmas is about good food, wine and being with the people I love.Every person has his or her own way of expressing their love and gratitude. For me its all about cooking and sharing the pleasures of good food with my family and hosting dinner parties for friends.As you can imagine, my kitchen is super busy these days and the alluring aroma of whatever is baking in the oven fills the house, replacing the cold air with a cosy warmth. I have been doing a line-up of dinners in red, white and green. My favourite is this Portobello Mushroom, Baby Spinach And Roast Tomato Quiche in a light wholewheat crust. I serve it with a millet and greens salad for a healthy wholesome dinner.The Mexican Tortilla Lasagne is my take on the overdone Mexican fajitas and tacos. I make it just like a lasagne, but replace the pasta sheets with tortilla wraps and make multiple layers with Mexican black bean filling, fresh spicy salsa and grated cheddar or mozzarella cheese. Cover with foil and bake in the oven at 180C for 20 minutes and a further 10 minutes uncovered. Its delicious comfort food!Making mulled wine and stocking up bottles of it is an annual event at home. It is as simple as slow-cooking red wine with a bit of sugar, cinnamon, star anise, cloves, orange and lemon zest and some vanilla till the flavours have all come together. Aaah, cant you smell it already?Talking of mulled wine, I want to share with you my classic Berry Mulled Wine Sauce recipe. I make a jar of this goodness and keep it in the fridge. Just heat it up and serve over ice cream, cheesecake, panna cotta or simply sandwich it between two cookies for that little bite of indulgence. You can use strawberry, blueberry or any other berry, frozen or fresh.My Spiced Apple Cake is adapted from chef Ottolenghis recipe (you would have seen him on the popular MasterChef Australia last season). So easy to make but so delicious and good-looking. Ditch the classic apple pie and try making this, it definitely makes a humble apple look super glamorous in this glitzy season! Enjoy it as it is or heat it up and pair it with some vanilla ice cream.While we have sorted out the adults with some mulled wine, we need something special for the little elves to drink while hopping around the Christmas tree. Since strawberries are in season now, I created a fun Strawberry Mint Lemonade that is a big hit with my kids. Add in some fresh mint and green lime slices and you have a beautiful pop of colours to fit into the festive spirit. And if you spike it with a dash of vodka or white rum, you have the perfect cocktail.I hope you enjoy making and sharing these goodies. As for me, I am off to southern Italy to celebrate Christmas with my husbands family. And what is it all about? You guessed it, eating, drinking and more eating! Seasons greetings and happy holidays from me to you!Spiced Apple Cake Image credit: Natasha CelmiSpiced Apple CakeIngredients130g salted butter at room temperature150g castor sugar3 eggs, whisked2tsp vanilla essence300g all purpose flour1tsp baking sodatsp salt200g plain yogurtFor the apple mix3 large apples, cut in wedges100g brown sugartsp cinnamontsp cardamom, crushedtsp lemon zestMethodPreheat the oven to 160C.

She had gone to the Khan Market eatery, and enjoyed her chorizo and baby potatoes with wilted spinach and poached egg so much that she had a second helping of the same dish. I am, at present, not on speaking terms with chorizos and other porky products, but still thought Sly Granny deserved a dekko. Then, just a few days ago, we got a call from a dear friend. Were we free to have lunch with her and her daughter (our much loved niece)? The answer to that was pithy: Yes, we said.So there we were in Khan Market one sunny afternoon, looking for Sly Granny. I asked around, and was told to take the middle lane, turning left if we were approaching it from Bahrisons. Sly Granny is on the left, on the first floor. The address is 4, Khan Market, and the phone number for booking your tables (which you should do, because it was rather busy on a weekday, too) is 011-4905 8941.The dcor is pleasing, with nice old-style posters on the staircase and the walls. And on the window sills they have lots of fresh herbs growing, which are added to salads and other dishes, we were told by the helpful servers. Sly Granny, which has a branch in Bangalore, opened in Delhi in August.We asked for chicken salad with walnut and celery  from the small plates section. Our friend wanted fish moilee with curry leave rice and kasundi jhal muri, and the niece, mushroom and black olive tortellini. My wife asked for the roast chicken with garlic mash, asparagus, green beans and win jus and I, the grilled fish. Mine was a Calcutta betki, which is a fish that I enjoy, and the friends moilee was sole. And for dessert, since we were told brie en croute would take some time, we asked for lava cake and affogato.Crispy textureEvery dish was superb. The walnuts in the salad were crunchy, and the chicken had infused in the flavours of celery. The moilee was a bit different, and we had been told that the fish would be crumb fried. So the dish consisted of a little mound of flavoured rice with two pieces of golden fried fish on top, and some sauces on the side. The friend loved it. My fish was delicious, too. It was firm within with a crispy texture and came with a lemon-garlic butter sauce on a bed of lip-smacking buttered and mashed potatoes and topped with micro greens (from the window sill!). I squeezed a piece of lemon over it, and it was like nirvana.The mushroom and black olive tortellini was nice and rich, and had a sauce prepared with basil cream and brown butter and flavoured with sage and toasted pine nuts. I had a bit of the chicken (with garlic mash, asparagus, green beans and win jus)  and thought it was amazing. It had a crispy skin, while the flesh was juicy and tender. We ended our meal with a rich lava chocolate cake served with vanilla ice cream, and the affogato, a nice mix of bitter and sweet tastes.This is a place that is known for its food  its Salmon Gravalax (salmon cured with salt, sugar and dill), pulled chicken tacos with tomato chutney and pickled onions, duck ragout tagliatelle and black pepper salmon. But I know what I am going to go back for once pigs and I resume our happy relationship (happy for me, that is, alas not so happy for the poor pigs). I will have their biscuits and gravy  buttermilk biscuits, pork sausages, sage and bacon gravy.I am counting the days. 10, 9, 8..."

The city witnessed a Gold Rush for a few decades, onwards of 1850, and was set to be the next New York, so youll find marvelous remnants of Victorian architecture and ornate lattice-decorated homes alongside a thriving central business district. The centre of the city is all walking distance and is interspersed with restaurants and trendy bars. It is a fabulous city in which to unwind since it has a lively outdoor cafe life, wine bars and the two wine-growing areas  Mornington Peninsula and Yarra Valley, both great weekend getaways and an hours drive away. Meanwhile, here are my 10 must-do things in Melbourne.Collins Kitchen, Grand HyattHave your breakfast here. Grand Hyatt must be one of the best locations for any city hotel and its breakfast is so stunning in terms of quality and variety that you can easily skip lunch that day. It isnt surprising that they have won the Gourmet Travellers Best Hotel Breakfast Award for three years running. A unique feature is the range of fresh juices squeezed on the spot in any combo you want and the smoothies. Anyone who loves Asian food would be delighted with the restaurants wok-and-steamer station (yes for breakfast!). They do all the baking and viennoiserie in-house. Croissants, predictably, are just perfect.Geloso Gelati at Queen Victoria Market, which is spread over seven hectares Image: Karen AnandQueen Victoria MarketSpread over seven hectares, Queen Victoria Market is the largest open-air market in the southern hemisphere. Around 1,000 traders sell everything, from exotic Australian fruits and vegetables, local and imported gourmet foods, meat, fish and poultry to hardware, clothing and authentic Australian artefacts and souvenirs. Its a traditional Victorian structure built in 1878 during the heyday of the citys Gold Rush.The best way to understand how the market operates and a chance to meet some of the third and fourth generation vendors is to enroll for the Ultimate Foodies tour. I had Carmel guiding me around and she was a wealth of information, plus the exercise allowed me to taste without feeling embarrassed. Merchandise is removed from the stalls at the end of each trading day. It is a reflection of the eating trends in the city today with a lot of organic produce, kangaroo and game and a huge range of smoked meats, olives and cheese. It is also home to new and upcoming eateries and food concepts like the one I stumbled upon, Geloso Gelati.Queen Victoria Deli is a hidden gem of the food and cafe scene Image: Karen AnandHidden Secrets tourI thoroughly enjoyed the Hidden Secrets tour with Fiona Sweetman. I enrolled on the Cafe Culture walk but Fiona was flexible enough to take me to some of Melbournes designer shops, point out some hip and happening rooftop bars and have a great cup of coffee in the bargain. Diverting from the main drag of coffee-lined laneways, the Cafe Culture walk takes you on a tour of Melbournes hidden-away food and cafe scene, meeting people who are passionate about tea, coffee and food. Most importantly, you discover places you would never have found on your own and get a real taste of Melbournes unique flavour. They also do history and architecture walks and a progressive degustation for hardcore foodies.Chin Chin, a wacky Melbourne eatery Image: Karen AnandLunch at Chin ChinA breath of fresh air on the Melbourne eating-out scene, this is a wacky Melbourne eatery down Flinders Lane. The staff are young and perky and the food pretty amazing. Must-try items are the Barramundi and Crispy Pork Salad, the most amazing Tom Yum Soup I have had in a long time and the Jungle Curry with Steamed Fish and Diamond Clams. If youre uncertain of what to order, just go for the Feed Me#1 where they give you a selection of their favourite dishes until you say no more. Theyve also produced two very good cookbooks. I highly recommend Chin Chin, the cookbook.Pellegrinis is a must if you want to understand the history of Italians in Melboune Image: Karen AnandCoffee and strudel at Pellegrinis Espresso BarHundreds of Italians immigrated to Victoria in the late 19th century and then after World War II when many agricultural workers from southern Italy chose to settle down in Victoria to escape the economic hardships back home. The area around Bourke Street in central Melbourne is where many of them started small businesses, restaurants and coffee shops. Pellegrinis Espresso Bar started in 1954 as an espresso bar with, reportedly, the first espresso machine in Melbourne. Twenty years later, two friends, Sisto Malaspina and Nino Pangrazio, bought it over and continued the tradition, keeping the same menu and decor. Pellegrinis is a Melbourne institution. The iconic espresso bar serves authentic Italian food and, of course, fantastic coffee. I first discovered it when my son was studying there. It was the favourite for hungry students and it wouldnt be uncommon to be invited by the owners to share enormous bowls of spaghetti with tomato sauce or lasagna drooling with cheese. Pellegrinis is like stepping back in time and a must if you want to breathe and understand the history of Italians in the city. The Apple Strudel is to die for. The cafe is now listed by the National Trust of Australia.Attica's brilliantly thought-out 17-course tasting menu is worth every penny Image: Karen AnandDinner at AtticaIts best not to say too much about the award-winning, much-talked-about, hard-to-get-into Attica. Ben Shewry has been making waves on the Australian eating-out scene for several years now. Attica was recently awarded number 20 in the world on the prestigious Worlds 50 Best Restaurants list (prepared by the UK media company William Reed Business Media).My expectations were high as I took a taxi on the 40-minute journey from central Melbourne to an eastern suburb called Ripponlea to eat at one of the most-sought-after restaurants in Australia.There is a three-month waiting list to get a reservation and I arrived promptly at 6.30pm. I was squeezed in after much persuasion. Mindfully sourced, Australian flavours and produce (marron, finger lime, kangaroo and abalone), skilful cooking and a lot of intellect goes behind his food. Ben Shewry spending more than half an hour chatting with me appeared shocking when one considers the evening he had ahead of him. It is a brilliantly thought-out 17-course tasting menu only and at Aus $295 without wine is worth every penny.Cruffins at Lune Croissanterie, a current rage Image: Karen AnandLune CroissanterieTaking the city by storm is Lune Croissanterie in the old neighbourhood of Fitzroy. Their new branch, right opposite Grand Hyatt on Collins Street, is testament to their ever-growing queues. This is an Australian version of the famous French croissant in many new avatars. Although they claim their plain croissant is the bestseller, you must gorge on the Lemon Curd Cruffin  a cross between a croissant and a muffin, almond croissant  and their savoury Ham and Gruyere. A great way to start the day!Mosaic floors and an arched glass skylight at 19th century Block Arcade Source: Karen AnandBlock and Royal ArcadesThe opulent 19th century Block Arcade with the iconic Hopetoun Tea Room and the Royal Arcade with a great little chocolate shop called Koko Black complete my shopping experience in the city. The Block Arcade, part of the Golden Mile heritage walk, is blessed with original stained glass windows, mosaic floors and an arched glass skylight. There are a number of independent Aussie retailers, including Creswick Woollen Mills, Alpaca Collection and Beechworth Honey. Similar in style is Royal Arcade, the oldest arcade in Australia. While youre shopping, check out Gaunts Clock, where mythical figures Gog and Magog ring the chimes every hour.The iconic Hopetoun Tea Room Source: Karen AnandAesop body careI was introduced to this local bath, body and skin care brand when I first visited Melbourne almost 20 years ago. I am so happy that it not only survives, its thriving and has several branches in the city and all over Australia. The brands shops look like Victorian apothecaries with modern design and functional brown bottles. Its like a thinking, 21st century version of the Body Shop. Products I buy there include the geranium leaf body balm and hydrating body treatment oil, hand creams and hydrating cream for stressed skin. The products are made from natural botanicals, so they are safe and pure and smell delicious. Ingredients are all declared on the packaging, unlike a lot of expensive cosmetic brands, and the staff is very well informed. By the way, its all reasonably priced.A collection of Australian and imported cheese presided over by Victor Persinette Source: Karen AnandSpring Street GrocerThe deli and the juice bar here is a great place to buy and see gourmet products. I also discovered a little secret air-conditioned cheese shop and tasting room downstairs, which has an amazing collection of Australian and imported cheese presided over by Victor Persinette.Karen Anand is a culinary consultant, food writer and entrepreneur.

The entrance which was turned into a dumping spot years ago, continues to overflow with waste every day. Not a thing has changed about the facade of the market except that more stakeholders dump garbage here now, says S. Saravanan, a vendor.Thayir Market, as it is referred to by the public, is at least 60 years old, say the vendors. What first started off as a fish market later saw the sale of fruits, dairy items and later vegetables.It is one of Madurais oldest markets, Mr. Saravanan says, and there is history in each of its corners. Currently, there are 152 shops at the market selling a variety of vegetables. This centrally located market also falls under the area of development zone of the Smart City Mission. A number of issues plagues the market and its surrounding areas, says S. Deepalakshmi, a tomato vendor.At least 100 trucks frequent East Marret Street to deliver a variety of items to the vegetable market and to the wholesale markets nearby. This creates extensive traffic in the area and leads to commotion as there is no proper pedestrian crossing. The quality of roads is poor too, she adds.R. Annapechi, who has sold vegetables at the market for 40 years now, says though the market now has asbestos sheet instead of thatched roofs, the smell of piling garbage has worsened with time.I cannot eat or sit in my shop because of the hideous smell. Some say they get used to the smell with time, but I have not. The market is in its worst condition during monsoon time, she adds. We can now see pelts and waste parts of slaughtered goats dumped into the bins. The hotels nearby also throw their waste here, she says. What began as one bin has now become three, says K. Ammaiappan, a functionary of Centre of Indian Trade Unions and a vegetable vendorMs. Deepalakshmi says there are no proper toilet facilities for women inside the market. The toilet inside the market complex is dysfunctional, she adds.The vendors also say the composting bins kept by the Corporation inside the premises have not been useful. Mr. Saravanan and P. Kaniraja, both functionaries of the CITU, say it was used only for one week by vendors. No crackdown was conducted on its usage after the initial enthusiasm expressed by the civic body in 2017, they add.Corporation Commissioner S. Aneesh Sekhar says the civic body was planning to instal 10 underground bins as part of the Smart City Mission plan.Thayir Market has been chosen as one of the locations, he adds."

Ranis father died on the way to hospital on FridayCollege yet to submit report on bird deathsShankar, a priest at the temple, told TOI that jowar, sunflower, turmeric and ragi are grown in the region and the only agrochemical shop in the area is at Martalli.Veterinary College, Bengaluru, is yet to submit a report on the cause of death of birds near the temple. In all, 27 crows and a mynah died after they were suspected to have had the poison-laced food.MM Hills wildlife forest officials sent four bird samples to the college to ascertain the cause of death. Forensic Science Laboratory authorities said monocrotophos is the cause of human deaths, but they were yet to ascertain that of the bird deaths.A forest officer said a team of 30 members combed the area in the temple's vicinity to check if more birds or animals had died, but they didnt find any.Opposition leader in the assembly, BS Yeddyurappa, said the temple should be brought under the muzrai department. In the legislative council, health minister Shivanand Patil admitted that district hospitals do not have enough ventilators. Norms stipulate at least four ventilators in a district hospital, and he promised to sanction more for districts.Since the casualties were many, ventilators werent enough. Therefore, officials decided to rush patients to Mysuru. After providing treatment to the needy, 80 ventilators were still on standby, he added."

A camera focusing on the kitchen, where the tomato bath that was served as prasadam to the devotees was prepared, is also dysfunctional, much to the cops chagrin.Police pointed out that the temple premises are mostly uninhabited in the evening, and as evidence of the tragedy having been an act of sabotage mounts, cops said that miscreants may have been up to some mischief at that time. Had this been a case of just food poisoning, we would not have seen the effects as immediately, nor would they have been so severe. In this case, reaction to the prasadam was immediate. All those who had the tomato bath were seen writhing in pain near the kitchen, a police official said.Shankar, one of the priests at the temple, said that nearly 15kg of rice was used to prepare the tomato bath, which was to be distributed among them and the devotees. It was for a special occasion since the foundation stone was laid to build the temples gopuram . But, some devotees arrived early, and we served them food, deciding to eat the same at a later time. But fate had something else planned, said Shankar.Chamarajanagar superintendent of police Dharmendra Kumar Meena told STOI that a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder had been registered against thus far unknown miscreants. We have launched a probe, Meena said.Kollegal deputy superintendent of police Puttamadaiah, who is heading three investigation teams constituted to probe the incident, said that they were quizzing many people, and that it was too early to state anything conclusively since cops were awaiting reports."

The cool weather and all this love and happiness around calls for some warm, cosy food. For me, its all about hearty one-pot hot dishes for the family to share.I love the flavours from the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern kitchens  simple, fresh ingredients cooked with bags of flavour. My culinary philosophy emphasises on cooking with local seasonal produce. There are beautiful pumpkins, carrots, oranges and greens in the market these days and there are so many innovative ways to prepare them. Roasting vegetables and meat in the oven is a great way to cook as you dont have to keep hovering around the stove. Also, the nutritional value remains intact and you get a lovely smokey-charred flavour.Here are some of my current favourite Mediterranean winter dishes that you must try making soon. They are vegetarian but you could add some grilled chicken or fish to them. Alternatively, enjoy them as an accompaniment to your meat or seafood dish.Roast Pumpkin, saffron and orange soupA boring pumpkin soup gets transformed into an orchestra of flavours.Ingredients: 2tbsp olive oil, one onion (cut in wedges), 500g pumpkin (cut in wedges), 1tbsp chilli/sriracha sauce, 5-6 saffron strands, zest of one orange, 500ml (or more) water,  cup coconut milk (or cream), salt and freshly-cracked pepper,  cup pumpkin seeds (toasted), chilli flakes, 2tsp honey/date syrup, fresh coriander/parsleyMethod:Preheat the oven to 220 degrees Celsius. Line a baking tray with butter paper. In a bowl, combine the pumpkin, onion, olive oil, salt and a good grind of pepper and toss well. Bake on the tray for 25 minutes till the veggies are soft and caramelised.Boil 500ml water with Sriracha sauce, saffron, orange zest, tsp salt and pepper. Bring to the boil and then add the pumpkin mix along with any oils from the pan. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for five to 10 minutes.Remove from heat and cool for a bit. Blend. Transfer back to the same pot and stir in the coconut milk and adjust the seasoning. Combine the pumpkin seeds with the honey/date syrup and chilli flakes.Pour soup into bowls, top with pumpkin seeds and some coriander or parsley.Burnt garlic greens Image: Natasha CelmiBurnt garlic greensDo not waste the broccoli stems.

This should take only a couple of minutes as you want the veggies to remain crunchy.Heat the olive oil in a pan and add the garlic and chilli.Cook till brown and add the veggies and coat well with the garlic chilli oil.Cook on low heat for a minute.Add salt, pepper, lime juice and zest. Top with toasted almonds.Chickpea, red peppers and coconut stew Image: Natasha CelmiChickpea, red peppers and coconut stewA powerhouse of rounded nutrition with delicate flavours.

How do you lose it?,https://www.telegraphindia.com/health/what-is-a-trigger-point-how-do-you-lose-it/cid/1678451,2018-12-14,"Muscles and nerves get tangled up and need to be released Image: iStockI developed pain on the outer side of my thigh. I ran my hand along the leg and found that there was a very tender lump. There is agonising pain whenever I touch it.This is probably a trigger point  an area where the muscles and nerves have tangled up. It needs to be released. You can do this yourself by massaging it with your thumb. You can also apply ice for 10 minutes, rubbing it in a circular motion. You can use a foam roller to massage out the pain.You can go to a physical therapist who will use a non-invasive device like an ultrasound to remove the trigger. Triggers tend to reform. Stretch the muscles regularly to prevent this.Diet woesI am overweight and feel guilty about it. I diet and exercise. I do manage to lose some weight, only to regain it all and then some more.When you diet and starve your body of calories, the brain signals that you are hungry. Immediately, you crave simple carbohydrate snacks, sweets and chocolates. The blood sugar level spikes and you feel satiated. Unfortunately the tendency is to do this repeatedly at ever shorter intervals. That contributes to the weight gain.You could eat a fruit, a carrot or a raw tomato if you are hungry and steer clear of the carbohydrates. That way your hunger pangs may be temporarily satisfied.How much exercise?I am 60 years old and I retired a few months ago. I walk 30 minutes a day. Is that enough?It is good that you are walking. Try to reach your target heart rate. This is calculated as 80 per cent of 220 minus age. Muscles tend to waste as you grow older, so you also need to do weight training at least three times a week using light weights (2-kilo dumbbells). Stretches and yoga prevent stiffness brought on by increasing age. If you do all this, your balance will remain good, muscle and bones will be healthy and falls will be prevented.Stubborn babyMy one-month-old baby refuses to feed at my wifes breast. Should we start bottle feeds?Babies have a rooting reflex. If you touch the side of the cheek with the nipple or the tip of your finger, the baby turns its head and latches on. If you try to force the nipple into the mouth, the baby will reject it.Avoid beansI feel bloated, my stomach hurts, and I pass embarrassing amounts of gas.This may be due to your diet. You may be able to reduce it if you eat fewer beans and carbohydrates. Also, avoid aerated beverages. Drink plenty of plain water, at least three litres a day. Eat at least 2-3 fruits per day and cultivate regular bowel habits.Morning sicknessMy daughter is pregnant, and she vomits eight to 10 times a day. It is tough to watch.Vomiting during pregnancy may occur because of a urinary tract infection or for no reason. The obstetrician will be able to sort this out. There are a few simple manoeuvres to help. She could walk for a half hour morning and evening in the fresh air on level ground. She could leave the kitchen area when food is being fried. She could have acupressure performed on her wrists for 20 minutes every morning and evening. She could also give up food and eat only vanilla ice cream for a day. For some mysterious reason, it helps some women end vomiting. If all this fails then tablets may be required.The writer is a paediatrician with a family practice at Vellore and author of Staying Healthy in Modern India.

Though August and September witnessed a couple of spells of rain, the officials termed it as untimely.Telling effectWith decrease in the water table, the rabi season has its drawbacks, with the farmers unwilling to take up crops. As against the expectations of officials and farmers as well, the paddy yield turned dismal in about 30,000 hectares and the groundnut crop could survive in just 1,600 hectares, while it is set to perish in about 18,000 hectares.Agriculture Officer (Chittoor) G. Sujatha said that 2018 witnessed 42% deficit rainfall. She said this phenomenon had a telling effect on the overall agriculture scenario in the district.Though the district administration had cherished ambitious plans for the horticulture sector this year, the scenario had presented dismayed results with mango growers receiving a jolt due to delayed flowering and crop cutting. The district administration had to come to their rescue by arranging support price in coordination with the pulp industry.The deficit rainfall in Kuppam region has brought disappointment to the horticulture sector, adversely impacting the rose and grape gardens.The farmers said that unlike the previous years, this year saw prolonged dry spell till the second week of October, taking away the moisture in air.The sugarcane cultivation in the western mandals also took a beating. Though some farmers were persuaded to undertake natural farming to overcome the drought conditions, it was much delayed, and they could only think of the switch next season.The saving grace is that tomato growers in Madanapalle region escaped the wrath of drought by undertaking the cultivation in multiple phases. Much to their happiness, the groundwater table was not alarming till recently."
