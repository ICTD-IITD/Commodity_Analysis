Palanisamy said that the Government should immediately process the applications of those farmers who had applied for free power connection and process within three months the applications of those farmers who would be applying for power connection in the coming days.He sought repair and maintenance of the shutters at Parambikulam Reservoir that would help release of water to Thoonakadavu. He also sought the construction of a canal from River Bhavani to fill tanks and water bodies so as to help farmers take up cultivation on over 50,000 acre.Eswaran, a farmer of Chokkanur, urged the State Government to subsidise natural pest repellents that would help farmers fight the white fly menace. He said coconut, guava, sapota, tomato and vegetable crops were damaged due to the fly. The natural pest repellents were available in the market at Rs. 500  600 a litre, which was exorbitant for the farmers.Periasamy, a farmer from Theethipalayam, sought an end of boars destroying crops.The farmers then handed over a cheque for Rs. 10,000 to the district administration to be used in relief operation in cyclone-affected districts."

Farmers also agreed that innovation is the key to the next level of reforms in production and income. The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Ropar, has put up on display many products, one of which was 'Smart integrated irrigation and energy management system'.Talking about this innovative system, Dr Vikrant Bhakar, from IIT Ropar, said, ""This product helps convert extra power from solar to AC through an inverter and the farmer can save up to 7,560 units of power per year, and earn a good amount of money, if he decides to sell this power.""The Institute has also displayed products for keeping fruits and vegetables fresh for two to three days; for peeling off peas; and Agri Marketing-App.""We are the technology partner for a project on 'Sustainable Food Supply Chain Systems and Water Management', being undertaken in collaboration with the University of Cambridge,"" Bhakar added. 'Innovation is Great' - so goes the tagline of the pavilion of the United Kingdom (UK).There are multiple companies which have brought along their innovative products in the streams of pre and post-harvest management. Nextek has developed a hydrogen-based film to increase the shelf-life of the agri-produce.Speaking of the product, Professor Edward Kosior, Managing Director, Nextek said, ""Our packaging has the capacity to reduce water loss and stop condensation, hence the life of the agri-products increases. We are undertaking this project in collaboration with India and ten companies from both the countries are engaged in research, development and testing.""Ardra Systems has displayed their soil sensors, which release water when required, saving the wastage of water. PBD Biotech has developed a revolutionary kit to identify bacteria in a cow's milk, which will work for disease prevention.Also, countries like Canada, China, Israel and Netherlands also have displayed many innovative products in grain storage management, biosystems, genetics, disease control.Khristein Water, co-founder of Sponnado, a Canada based company which has developed an air sampler says, ""these products cost Rs 16,000 and will give the farmer advance warning from one to two weeks that there is fungal infection in his crop be it potato, tomato and other crops and thus the farmer will be able to take remedial measures and spray accordingly. It will cover an area of 50 to 100 acres thus a group of farmers or village can buy this system. There is small device in this sampler which will collect the sample and that has to be send to the laboratory for testing and thus from the test one will be clear which kind of fungal infection,'' she says.Tech giant Microsoft also endeavors to make companies and farmers aware of their B2B solution which is a cloud-enabled 'Special Purpose Agri-specific Platform'.A representative of Microsoft shared that the app-based system will help the pharmaceutical companies, farm equipment companies, seed companies to gather information about the ground and weather conditions to send an advisory to the farmers about when to spray pesticides when to sow the seeds.""Research and testing is on for this product, and it will be made available globally by next year,"" he said.Pramod Rajan, Head - Research and Development, International Tractors Limited (Sonalika Group) said, ""For real ground-level adoption of technology, there needs to be a two-way communication between the business and the end-user. Just showcasing technology is never enough; it needs to be made available at the ground level."""

Many of the women workers are now taking up odd jobs and working as domestic helps. This will give them a better option, KSCDC chairman S.Jayamohan told The Hindu .Suphalam projectThe corporation will launch its own agricultural task force as an extension of Suphalam, its organic vegetable farming project inaugurated in September. The agriculture sector was severely hit by the floods leading to a steep fall in domestic vegetable production. Suphalam is one of the many projects introduced by the government to overcome the crisis, he said.At KSCDCs first vegetable farm in the State at Kottiyam, many crops are ready for harvest and some are available to the public at their outlet. We have spinach, eggplant, tomato, okra, green chilly, and beans at the factory along with banana and tapioca. The demand for organic vegetables is too high and we are developing a regular clientle as well. 300 workers were involved in farming in shifts and they were paid Rs. 3 lakh as remuneration. It guarantees more working days for the labourers, an income for the corporation and safe vegetables for the public. By December, all other factories will be part of Suphalam and the training too will start, he said.ObjectiveImplemented with the support of Kerala State Agency for the expansion of Cashew Cultivation, Horticorp, Agriculture Department and Haritha Mission, Suphalam aims to produce 100 tonnes of vegetables by March 2019 from the farms at various factories in the State.The corporation will also distribute MGNREGA job cards to all cashew workers so that their income is not blocked during the gaps when factories remain closed. Many of them are not card holders, so we will issue cards to them from December 6.Alternative vocationHe added the green task force was also part of attempts to find them alternative vocations, the only way of survival for the labourers in the crisis-stricken traditional sectors.We are slowly introducing them to other concepts so that their lives are not affected in the long run, he said."
5ce6180fe8e3fc56af411a6e,Turning over a new leaf,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/turning-over-a-new-leaf/article25639490.ece,2018-12-01,,The Hindu,"Rishim Sachdeva wants to visit Copenhagen. He is hopeful of heading there next summer and immersing himself in the citys sustainable and inventive approach to food.The head chef at Mumbais Olive Bar & Kitchen is on a mission to change the way people consume food and if his new menu is anything to go by, its a change we welcome with open arms and loosened belts.Backyard goodiesIn November, the iconic Mediterranean fine-dine in Bandra, Olive, celebrated its 18th anniversary. On offer are a new cocktail, and food menu. Not many may know that the restaurant has its own back garden; it flooded in the monsoon but is now blooming. It is here that bar manager John Leese seeks herbs and inspiration for a cocktail menu that aims to highlight agave spirits. The Garden of Eden (Rs. 630) has gin shaken with a lychee puree, with lemongrass and ginger adding fragrance and heat. The drink starts out bitter and then mellows down to a smooth sweetness; with basil oil adding depth. Tommys Margherita (Rs. 750) has agave nectar and El Jimador Blanco tequila and a sharp drink with citrus notes.In-house creationsThe drinks are respectable but its Olives food that makes the strongest impression. Sachdeva believes in treating ingredients and produce with respect and showcasing them to the fullest. Theres emphasis on organic and locally sourced fare (from across India), and reduced wastage. Everything that cannot be sourced locally is made in-house, including bread, butter, sauces, spreads, ferments, pickles and sausages. Earlier we did a lot of fruit and vegetables ferments. Now, we are pushing the boundaries using grain and wheat and fish, says Sachdeva. Its easier and simpler this way; we dont want to rely on cans. It makes for food that is inventive and indulgent.Take the Tuna Jerky (Rs. 525), richer and more nuanced than any meat jerky. Sachdeva takes fresh, local tuna and smokes it slowly till it dries up and intensifies in flavour. The jerkys saltiness is softened by crushed potatoes and smoked ketchup. A Red Velvet Fried Chicken 2.0 (Rs. 525) dunks chicken in a batter of cake crumbs and buttermilk and fries it till golden and moist and dusts it with red velvet crumbs. Its finger lickin good. The no-waste Sweet Corn Gnocchi (Rs. 375) is a Sachdeva favourite. It uses every part of the corn: cob and kernels become a puree, kernels turn into gnocchi, husk is fermented and added to puree, and some of the husk is used to smoke the accompanying cabbage hearts. All the trimmings from the corn and other vegetables go into a vegetarian XO sauce, smoky on the tongue and caramel in colour.Comfort foodThose with a dairy turn of mind will be delighted with the cheese on offer, sourced from different farms across India and some made in-house. Homemade stringy cheese is stuffed in rice balls, drizzled with truffle oil and served as a Mushroom and Truffle Arancini (Rs. 375). Its crisp, gooey and earthy. The Baked Brie & Truffle (Rs. 450) is stunning  truffle brie is paired with mascarpone and heaps of parmesan shavings, served on house-made raisin bread. Its a mouthful of umami, warm and creamy brie playing with the slight sweetness of the crunchy bread. Its a dish that shows off technique, has locally sourced ingredients and it serves as delicate comfort food. Theres homemade ricotta, crumbly and heavy pairs with smoky roasted sweet potatoes (Rs. 395); stringy burrata with fresh, sweet tomatoes (Burrata and Heirloom Tomatoes, Rs. 395) and chilled goats cheese with fresh figs and quinoa (Figs and Goat Cheese, Rs. 395).To round-off the meal is the Vodka Milk Panna Cotta (Rs. 450). Vodka added to milk helps the resultant ice cream set on its own. This intense combination is offset by a plain vanilla panna cotta, a berry puree for some sourness, and apple granite (with cucumber juice); theres white chocolate too, but it makes the whole dish too heavy.The menu will see a few additions over the next few months. Sachdevas homemade duck sausage, which sold out in a week is curing; and a new batch is expected in December. A spoiled can of expensive anchovies eventually led him to can his own fish so now mackerel bones and heads are being cured to make an intense oil. Expect many such experiments in the future, asserts Sachdeva.Olive, Khar (W); phone: 43408229, open from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. (Monday to Sunday) and 12.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. (Saturday and Sunday)"

Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav led one such group from Bijwasan. Narmada Bachao Andolan activist Medha Patkar, All India Kisan Sabhas Hannan Mollah and others joined the protest that was held under the united banner of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee The march Thursday led to traffic snarls on 26km of city roads. We are saying sorry to people who have been troubled due to traffic snarls. We have distributed pamphlets among them to briefly explain the farmers distress, Yadav said.The pamphlets urged the people to join them when they march to the Parliament on Friday. Farmer groups also threatened to protest naked if stopped from reaching there.The pamphlets stated that farmers get only Rs 5 per kilo of tomato while consumers pay Rs 30. Our life is also cheap. In the last 20 years, over three lakh farmers have committed suicide, the pamphlet informed.The farmers said they demand the convening of the Parliament to pass two bills: one pertaining to one-time full loan waiver, the other for a long-term institutional measure to ensure farmers are not pushed into debt again. They also demand implementation of Swaminathan Commission recommendations that say the minimum support price should be fixed at 50% above the comprehensive cost of production.Yadav called the BJP government at the Centre the most anti-farmer government ever. The protest march is for the liberation of farmers from the spectre of suicides, from various forms of exploitation propagated by the state and from organised loot and plunder, he said.Anish Kumar from Delhi School of Social Work said there is a lack of political will to address the agrarian distress. We joined the protest to give strength to the voice of the farmers that has been raised at a crucial time ahead of next General Election. We want the policy-makers to listen to the voice, Kumar said.A group of students from Delhi University joined the protest march near Dhaula Kuan. The farmers claimed that in all marches students, artists, lawyers, doctors, etc, extended support.A musical evening mainly based on agrarian, rural and folk themes was organised at Ramlila Maidan where the farmers retired for the night.In Video: Delhi: Farmers gather in capital today to protest against centre"

Tell me chetta Folk singer Kovan and team sang with vigour in Tamil, as the black and yellow logo of Aarppo Aarthavam shone in the background. As the venue, the Vanchi Square in Kochi, swayed like Punnamada Lake to their tunes, the activists who launched the campaign welcomed each of the enthusiasts who trickled in to watch whats going on. Yes, we are trying to bust the discriminations and myths based on menstruation in our State, chechi. You may sit inside if you like, said one of the organisers to a curious inquiry from a middle-aged woman, and she blushed like a tomato.While the onlookers like her witnessed the proceedings with a question mark looming on their faces, the voices from inside the little tent at the venue were firm. Lawyer Maya Krishnan, one of the organisers of the event, said, India is a country that signed an international covenant, agreeing that it will campaign against the biases based on menstruation. But we saw how the people responded to the topic of womens entry to Sabarimala Temple, saying the people of the gender arent supposed to be in its premises as women menstruate. Its scary how even in our families, there is a discrimination against it and today, we launch a campaign aiming to wipe these out for good.The programme saw the participation of many progressive thinkers, ranging from social critics like Sreechithran, transgender people, women who had announced their plans to visit Sabarimala and more. While they were the invited guests, the audience included those like C P Srihari, a techie who came all the way to Kochi from Thiruvananthapuram to take part in the event. When such a movement happens, the least you can do is proclaim your support by giving it word of mouth publicity. I am someone who often speaks for equality of women in all forums possible and taking part in such a programme would help me speak for it better, even if it is at a gathering of friends, Srihari says.Social critic Sreechithran M J, who also took part in the event, said its time we spoke out loud for those like the little girl who recently lost her life in Tamil Nadu while being forced to stay outside her house during cyclone Gaja because she was menstruating for the first time. Yes, there might be many people, including women, who speak in favour of the discrimination on our streets these days, but we are standing up for those many women who lost their lives, face unjust treatment and lead miserable lives for this natural, biological process, he says, alongside his mom and activist Jayashree.The organisers say that the programme at the Vanchi square is a launch pad for a detailed campaign to create awareness about menstruation. From school to school, college to college and family to family, we have charted out an initiative to do whats needed to cleanse this bias. Enough is enough, says Maya.In Video: Aarppo Aarthavam: Not letting discrimination thrive. Period."

Rajagopal was elated when his daughter R. Jayavarshini told him she was keen on pursuing farming  an avocation that ran in the family  despite having completed an engineering course. The father-daughter duo underwent training at a poly greenhouse plantation in Hosur and began cultivating crops at Rajappan Chavadi near Needamangalam.But their hopes came crashing down as Cyclone Gaja struck. She did not want to take up any other job, and I started the plantation in her name. The yield was very good and encouraging. But Cyclone Gaja turned everything upside down as our greenhouse plantations were completely destroyed, said Mr. Rajagopal, whose plantation was, notably, inaugurated by the District Collector.He had set up three units, covering 25 cents each. Each unit had cost over Rs. 9 lakh for the greenhouse and an additional Rs. 2 lakh for the installation of a drip irrigation system. The government subsidy is limited to one acre, which means the unit would get only Rs. 4.5 lakh as against the Rs. 9 lakh spent on building it.I had a structure capable of withstanding wind speeds of up to 120 km per hour. The destruction [caused by Gaja] shows that the wind speed [during the cyclone] was much higher, said S. Jeethaman Krishna, who took up agriculture after completing an MBA from the University of Wales.We are a family of agriculturists, and I opted for horticulture in Tiruvarur  the rice bowl. I established the plantation in 2013, said Mr. Krishna, who cultivated cucumber, tomato and coriander as an intercrop. He said a unit could produce 20 tonnes of vegetables and bring revenue of Rs. 15 lakh per annum.When asked whether he would be able to use his plantation again, Mr. Krishna said he would have to start from scratch, as the wind had shaken the foundation of the structure. The absence of an insurance scheme was a major problem, he added."

The 31-year-old guy from Delhi recently added another feather on his cap (read: chefs hat) when he appeared as a guest judge on one of the episodes of MasterChef Australia, on the popular shows 10th anniversary special season, in which the contestants had to recreate his famous butter chicken for an elimination round.In a telephonic chat with us, Saransh spoke about his MasterChef experience, future plans and a possible Goila Butter Chicken restaurant in Calcutta.You are globally known for your Goila Butter Chicken. Whats the secret that makes it different from butter chicken served elsewhere?Its actually a home recipe. I used to cook it for my parents when I was much younger. They used to always complain that as vegetarians, they got to eat a much more shoddy version of butter chicken, which is paneer butter masala. And that would always be too creamy and too sweet. When I went to my culinary school, I figured out a recipe where I would smoke it with coal and serve it to them. So basically, it would be more robust and smoky. Thats how I ended up infusing smoke into a traditional butter chicken gravy.I also reduced the amount of fat and dairy that goes into the dish  basically cream and butter  so the tartness of tomato shines out. Since we infuse smoke using coal  a more traditional technique  it makes the dish a little different. So Goila Butter Chicken is lighter, home-style and guilt-free; something that a millennial would eat. The dish is more in sync with today. Its not modern in its presentation but in its flavour profile.What is your earliest memory of having butter chicken?I am not someone who grew up eating butter chicken. The first butter chicken I ate was in my college, IHM, Aurangabad. My trainer was an ex-ITC chef and he had a very good recipe for the dish. That was my first taste of butter chicken  creamy, very refined, smooth with lots of flavours. Then when I went back to Delhi and tried the local butter chicken that people like, it was very different than what my trainer had made me try. What I realised was that people would actually savour the extra creamy, buttery and bright orange version of the recipe.Its interesting that despite being a vegetarian for most part of your life, you are known for a chicken dish. Wasnt it difficult to understand the flavours and innovate on a dish which you had never had until you were in college?When I was first put into the butchery section in college, I went with a professional approach since I didnt have any option. I didnt know how meat tastes, how its cooked. I feel cooking is a balance between passion and technique.Your personal favourite when it comes to butter chicken apart from your own?Its actually from a restaurant in Delhis Ashok Vihar called Invitation. For me, thats the best butter chicken I have ever had.How did your restaurant come about?I always thought I would open a fine-dining restaurant. I never thought I would end up opening a QSR which is centred around butter chicken! It occurred to me only after I started doing TV shows that we, as chefs, look at food as a luxury but when you travel across India you realise that its first a necessity. So this is when it came to my mind to test it out as a venture since I already had a popular recipe. So June 2016 is when I opened Goila Butter Chicken in Bombay.Whats next for Goila Butter Chicken?We are looking at expanding to different parts of the country. Right now its just Bombay but we are looking to expand to cities like Bangalore, Calcutta, Delhi and Gurgaon.You have been a contestant yourself on Food Food Maha Challenge (a reality show on Food Food) which you ended up winning too (2011). How was it like being a guest judge on a show like MasterChef Australia?Life has come full circle for me. When you find fame through a reality show, it becomes much more challenging because theres fame to deal with. Suddenly people start doubting your capability as a restaurant chef because they feel you are more of a TV person. So there has to be a balance. You have to keep honing your skills.I feel satisfied with the fact that I got an opportunity through winning a reality show. I was very, very happy that MasterChef got me on board not only because of my popularity but because of my product. That makes me feel very proud. I was just out of college when I had started watching MasterChef and I always used to dream of being on the show. And to be there as a guest judge, getting so much respect, makes you feel great.The set is beautiful, its a permanent structure that has been stationed there for 10 years. They are very professional and honest in their approach towards the show. No wonder MasterChef Australia is the most popular MasterChef franchise across the globe. Theres a soul to the show.Saransh Goila (centre) with (from left) Gary Mehigan, Matt Preston and George Calombaris on the sets of MasterChef Australia. Source: TwitterTell us some of the fun things that happened behind the scenes on the set...When I met Matt (Preston) on the set, he was talking about his trip to India. He is such a great orator that when he was talking about Hyderabadi Biryani, just the way he was describing it made me feel like having it right then and there. He is a fun person and also very particular about his costumes. I had done a pop-up at chef Georges (Calombaris) restaurant, as a part of the Melbourne Food & Wine Festival in the same month when we were filming MasterChef. He loves to party, engage with young people and promote them. I owe this opportunity to him.George is full of life, energetic. Matt is probably a romantic and an intellectual and Gary is down to earth, likeable and honest. He loves India, be it the food, spices, people he spends three months a year in India now. As an Indian, you would relate to him the most, he is very warm.Your name is in the Limca Book of Records for the longest road journey by a chef. What is your takeaway from it?If I had to break down India into different cuisines, there are so many communities, the cuisine is so diverse every 200km the flavour, food, spice blend, ingredients change. I was very fascinated with the North-east in fact  lots of fermentation, different cooking techniques. Nagaland was an amazing state to be in and experience the tribal cuisine; even Assam was interesting.In the south, I found Andhra cuisine to be quite interesting their pickles are amazing. I discovered gondhoraj lebu in Calcutta. I discovered many such ingredients and realised it would probably take a lifetime if I had to discover everything in our country.Any particular region that stood out?It would definitely be Nagaland. In fact, I did a special at my restaurant  Black Sesame Pork, which was there for three months.Globally, do you think the stereotypes about Indian food has somewhat started breaking or do they still exist?The stereotypes are definitely breaking. There are many international restaurants who are presenting India in a very different format. Be it Gaggan (Anand) in Bangkok or chef Garima (Arora) who became the first Indian woman to get a Michelin star. People have started to realise that Indian food isnt just about curry-driven gravy, its much more than that. Its balanced, theres so much history, influence of Ayurveda this is the time for Indian food to reposition itself.A TV show host, writer and a chef, which role do you like playing the most?The profile that works for me the most is that of a chef traveller. I like to travel within India and share with the world what our country has to offer. Thats something that gives me the most satisfaction.What will we see you doing next?Sadak Chef is something I am working on at the moment. The show (for a digital platform) promotes street chefs who have created amazing dishes but have never got their due. I will be travelling across the country. I am working on a couple of other shows as well; an international one too which we are doing with a big channel in Singapore. I am looking to be more global, trying and selling Indian food across the globe. Thats where I am headed with all my content and activities that I am doing in 2019.QUICK SIXChefs you look up to: I closely follow David Chang. Then theres Jamie Oliver; Anthony Bourdain was someone I used to take inspiration from. Back home theres Sanjeev Kapoor; I used to dedicatedly watch his shows. Now he is a friend and mentor. He will always be someone I look up to.An ingredient you are loving right now: Jackfruit, green garlic. But over all, its mushrooms.A dominant food trend right now: Looking within, going regional when it comes to Indian food. Just getting back the classics and presenting them in a more acceptable format. Theres so much sustainable farming happening, people are now talking about what is available in our country.Your fave cuisine: Indian. Difficult to choose which part of India though.Your earliest memory of cooking: When I made aloo paratha as a kid with the help of my uncle.Your biggest culinary influence: My grandfather. Though, while growing up, I learnt cooking from my mother, I was inspired by my grandfather because I was fascinated with him in the kitchen every Sunday cooking something for us."

And we finished up almost everything on the table. But let me start at the beginning. A dear friend from Kolkata was in town  ostensibly to see how I was doing. We were meeting her after a long time, so there was much to talk about. So we  a group of seven  gathered at Rustoms.Gourmets delightRustoms has been around for a while in Delhi. I used to hear good things about it when it was at Adhchini. Somehow, I never went there, quite possibly because the traffic there could be manic. But I had been raring to visit the place ever since I heard that Rustoms had moved to the Parsi Anjuman complex on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg.So we gathered there, and ordered chhanch and homemade raspberry soda (Rs. 150 each), sev puri and dahi batata puri (both Rs. 175), Russian pattice (Rs. 295), paatra ni macchhi (Rs. 325), prawn kababs (Rs. 325), salli boti gosht (Rs. 395), chicken dansak (Rs. 175), vegetable Parsi pulao (Rs. 395), caramel custard and lagan nu custard (both Rs. 250) and Bombay kulfi (Rs. 150).I just had a taste of all the fried dishes  and they were delicious. The papri with sev came with a heap of crunchy sev over the papri which had been topped with chopped onion and tomatoes and chutney. The dahi batata puris had potatoes, onions, chutney and a delightfully spiced curd over it. The prawn kababs were again a great mix of mashed prawn and spring onion. But what I really loved was the Rusian pattice  which was a mix of creamy cheese, chicken and mashed potatoes, coated with semolina and some cheese straws and then deep fried. It was  in one word  yum!I had the fish without any guilt pangs. It was a telapiya fillet which had been steamed wrapped in banana leaf after being smeared with sweet, sour and spicy chutney prepared with mint and coriander leaves. I had it with the vegetable pulao and loved it. I am told the prawn berry pulao is a must-have there, but we had friends with a prawn allergy, so steered clear of it.The salli boti gosht  mutton with a spicy tomato gravy topped with crispy potato straws  was nice and rich. I thought the chicken dhansak was just about ok. It seemed like a normal dhansak with minced chicken balls on the side.But I loved the desserts. I thoroughly enjoyed the creamy caramel custard and lagan nu custard  baked with nuts and raisins (I could taste the chironjee). The Bombay kulfi got over before I could even look at it. The mawa cake came gratis but was avoidable, I think.Way to goSo book a table and head for Rustoms at the Parsi Anjuman or Dharamshala. This is the sprawling Parsi complex (ample parking space there) next to the Maulana Azad Medical College, on the other side of the road from all the newspaper offices (Phone: 09910060502 and 01133106353).We left after the dessert but the other five lingered over coffee. And after eating and drinking all that, they eyed the food on other peoples tables and decided that the next time they are there, they will have a thaali. The vegetable thaali (Rs. 400) has soya pattice, Parsi dal, tarkari ni curry, vengna nu achar, steamed rice, Parsi rotis and chutney. The mutton thaali is for Rs. 495 and the pomfret one for Rs. 695. We will wait for the friend from Kolkata to come for another visit, and the Seven Hungry Men and Women shall return."

Farmers markets emerged on the scene almost a decade ago with Kavita Mukhis weekly market in Bandra that attracts a posse of dedicated shoppers. Since then, markets have sprung up in several neighbourhoods from Nariman Point, Shivaji Park, and Juhu to Powai, Thane and Vashi. In September, Caf Zoe launched a one-of-its-kind farmers market right inside their sprawling, light-filled space.The restaurant partnered with Taru Naturals, which works with small-scale farmers across India to provide resources and clean tech to enable organic farming. We met Tarus founder/CEO Ruchi Jain, who holds a Masters in Environment Change & Management from Oxford University, and is a passionate advocate of natural, organic farming.To marketWhat we need is to have thousands of farmers markets. People need to see that organic can be affordable, said Jain. Affordability has long been a pain point for the organic movement but the fresh fruits and vegetables at Caf Zoes farmers market are surprisingly well priced and of high quality. We stocked up on tomatoes and cucumbers, both sweet and flavourful, while the pomegranates are the deepest red we have seen and positively bursting with juice. All vegetables and fruits sold at the market come from Anil Rayates farm in Niphad in Nashik district. While farmers around him concentrate on grapes (Nashiks main cash crop), Rayate instead decided to go the organic route in 2009 with a mixed farm where he grows everything from leafy greens to onions, garlic, and other vegetables. He proudly showed us his certification from Participatory Guarantee System for India (PGS-India) a government body that certifies organic farming practices across India.I use traditional farming techniques like natural mulching, using jivamrut fertiliser (a fermented mixture of dung and urine of Indian Gir cows, jaggery, soil, and water), and natural fungicide made of fermented sugarcane juice, cow dung, yoghurt etc., explained Rayate.What made Caf Zoe venture into this area? We are now six-and-a-half years old and it has always been our plan to support communities, not just be a restaurant. Luckily we have been blessed with a large space that enables us to do these things, said Tarini Mohindar, co-founder of Caf Zoe. Mohindar had been toying with the idea of a farmers market for a while and had even spoken to a few organisers. But I didnt want to do something that was massive, just create a space where you can go and stock up on your veggies for the week, and you dont pay through your nose for it. You have a certificate that tells you its organic and theres no middleman involved, she explained. Mohindar met Jain at a pottery workshop organised at Caf Zoe (conducted by Jains sister), and was impressed with the work that Taru Organics did at the grassroots level. The restaurant has held two farmers markets since mid-September and the response has been encouraging. The Sunday brunch crowd has been leaving with bags filled with fresh produce as well as organic staples such as millets, dals, indie rice varieties like Indrayani, khapli wheat (emmer, an ancient wheat variety) atta, jaggery, turmeric, and more. Apart from partnering for the market, Caf Zoe sources produce from Taru Naturals, which also supplies to a handful of Mumbai restaurants like Kala Ghoda Caf, The Pantry, The Bombay Canteen, Olive, SodaBottleOpenerWala etc.Growing trendAs restaurants increasingly make an effort to source organic, a growing tribe of entrepreneurs is stepping in to fulfil the demand. One such is Zama Organics founded by Shriya Naheta. She graduated three years ago and returned to Mumbai from Los Angeles only to find that high-quality, organic produce was hard to come by at reasonable prices. What really inspired me to start Zama were the travels I went on after I was back. I went on a few trips to Uttarakhand and happened to visit farms in Pune and Nashik as well said Naheta. She started working directly with farmers to source organic produce locally, and currently works with three collectives  one small-time farmer in Pune and a group of farmers each in Nashik and Uttarakhand. One of my main sources is in Uttarakhand in a remote and inaccessible location above Nainital; they are so particular about crop rotation, and the time they sow the seeds or harvest the produce. They have really great irrigation from spring waters from the Himalayas, amazing air quality, and they have always grown organically. Everything they need for farming is grown in the farm itself; whatever vegetables get spoiled are inevitably converted into compost to be used back in the farming process, explained Naheta. Zama Organics supplies to restaurants like Masque, Suzette, Sequel, Rolling Pin, Quattro etc.Naheta also launched value-added products like honeys, jams, chutneys, and pickles, which were recently showcased at a four-course dinner at Masque. We want to really educate people on the concept of sustainability and gradually but surely create a shift, where people look at the benefits of eating sustainably grown and wholesome food, she said.Jain agrees; Restaurants are the harbingers of food innovation in India. So if restaurants like Caf Zoe make a statement with such markets that support small-scale organic farmers, we can get the message across, she said. Rayate had the last word; Now, everyone knows the ill effects of chemicals used in farming. Natural farming is the only solution if we have to sustain this for our future generations he said.Fresh produce and staples from Taru Naturals (tarunaturals.com) and Zama Organics (zamaorganics.com) can be ordered online with delivery available across Mumbai. The next Farmers Market at Caf Zoe will be held on Sunday, November 25 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m."

And on their way back from Ghosh Mansion, Aaduri gives Hem the lowdown on Lata and Ronny.Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, arguably the greatest exponent of relationships in literary Bengal, had written in Devdas that childhood love was, for all its intensity, ultimately cursed. It seldom led to happily ever-afters.But we are both over 18, Kakimoni, Lata had replied, softly, suddenly maudlin even though she found the possibility that what they had  that perfect, fragrant, sunset-coloured thing  might be poisoned to be highly remote. Shed buried her nose in the pink pashmina shawl she had stolen that season from Manjulikas almirah.When shed lifted her head, she saw Kakimoni smiling. Whaaat? shed said, and Kakimoni shucked her chin. That pink is perfect for people newly in love, shed laughed. You are right, it doesnt apply to those who are not children. But Kakimoni said that tartly, raising her eyes in the direction of the verandah where Ronny was bickering with Molly over the carrom board, much like a minor. Well find out, wont we? she said, Whether you were children or adults!Kakimoni would then heave herself from the bed and go out to their little kitchen, carved out of a nook where a tertiary stairway had been boarded up  the Ghoshes had all divided up their kitchens by then  in order to make them scrambled egg sandwiches with cheese. And Lata would drag herself out of bed and curl up in one of the Bombay fornicators kept outside on the verandah (neither she nor Ronny knew the term then), five of them in a line, and impatiently wait for Ronny to stop playing carrom and revise economics with her. Its he who needs the revision more, she would huff. But the sight of him and Molly wrapt in play also made for a pleasant picture. Once, unknown to Ronny, she had snuck his camera out of his bag and taken pictures of them.Where are those pictures? she wonders. Hadnt Ronny framed one and given it to her?When theyd broken up, shed told Kakimoni bitterly, on a weekend she was home with dark circles under her eyes, You were right. Childhood love is poisoned.Not me, Kakimoni had replied sadly, enveloping her in a hug, Sarat-babu.***The Bombay fornicators are long gone.Lata stands now where they used to be lined up and watches as the lights over the courtyard come on. It was Ghosh Mansion all this while; now, in the blink of an eye, it is transformed from a decaying house in a decaying neighbourhood into an unfamiliar place, a new continent, one where happiness and success and glory are all a handspan away for the taking.After Latad taken charge of the Molly-AJ wedding, along with the army Nimki had summoned from the massive contacts list on her phone, Ghosh Mansion had suddenly come alive in the last two days. Given the paucity of time, the rooms on the ground floor were all locked up for the evening in lieu of being cleaned (Lata kept a roster of the keys and promised the various owners of said rooms that it was a temporary matter). The corridor and the courtyard leading to the naach ghar were scrubbed clean. Not even a speck of dust should be visible to the Marwaris, Nimki was heard shouting every 10 minutes or so, Mollys mother-in-law has OCD and we better live up to her standards of cleanliness. In any case, Molly doesnt know any housework. If they see dirty corridors here, they will always link the two. FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE. Lata had also decided that since there was no time to get the walls painted, a major red herring was required. She cajoled the electrician to create a canopy of twinkling lights over the courtyard.The effect, Lata now sees, feeling quite pleased with herself, is magical.Molly steps out of Kakimonis bedroom in her engagement outfit and sighs at the lights. She wears a white chanderi full skirt trimmed beautifully in gold, paired with a post-box red choli. Much to her mothers unhappiness, shes refused to wear anything around her neck but the plain gold choker that Manjulika and Lata had given her from Manjulikas own collection and a pair of gold danglers that had been their great-grandmothers.Lata looks critically at Molly, straightens her tikli  the sole item from her parents trousseau  and then, gently kisses her cheek.I dont know what Id have done without you, Molly murmurs into her hair.Im glad I am here. And I hope you and AJ will come to London and stay with me so I can dispense jamai aador and luchis like a grown-up Ghosh.Molly squeezed her hands. Boro Jethis gold bracelet, studded with pearls and rubies, glittered. It had been a pair that, Lata knew, was given to Jethima, the eldest daughter-in-law, by their grandmother, and Jethima had given her one at her wedding, reserving the other for Molly. What about Goopys bride? Manjulika had said to Jethima then. Arre baba, Jethima had replied conspiratorially, Goopys wife will get a lot!I miss Goopy, Molly said.I was just thinking about him! Lata exclaimed, Anyway, now listen, Bobbys just texted me. They are about 15 minutes away. I think you should go now and sit in the throne room. Guests have arrived. Wheres the entourage?Almost as though theyd heard her, Mollys girlfriends, the old ones from school and college and the new ones from Berlin, all trooped out of her room, where theyd been getting ready. Their individual beauty enhanced by the collective glamour, the girls held themselves erect and frowned in concentration, speaking to each other in code. Lata did not miss a single detail of this pageantry: the wisps of hair slipping out of elaborate hairdos, the silken saris curving and catching at unaccustomed feet. They walked up to the balustrade awkwardly and then, finally finding their stride in their saris, followed Molly down the elaborate staircase, where ancestors in gilt frames looked down at them approvingly.Lata took pictures on her phone, waving the girls away, exhorting them to mind the way. A few minutes later, as they crossed the courtyard, carefully carefully, doddering on their high heels, saris and lehngas bunched up so that their calves were briefly visible, the lights fell on their youthful faces and covered them with stardust.From upstairs, in her pink-yellow tussore sari, Lata watched them and marvelled at the fierce brevity of childhood and youth.Now it was here. Alive and flickering in the stack of Mills and Boon novels under her bed, clattering upon the carrom board, surfacing in the large cupboards in the store room which were perfect for stolen kisses and the third-floor terrace which was perfect for horrible fights.And now it was gone.***First came the ashirbad and then the ring ceremony. The Jaiswals and the Ghoshes and the Germans and the assorted others all mingled happily, eating the delicious (if vegetarian) hors doeuvres and drinking gallons of Blue Lagoon.As regards the food, Boro Jethu had firmly put his feet down. At the Oberoi, they could serve whatever mishmash modern cuisine they wanted to, but at home, it would be old-fashioned comfort food. It was a gargantuan tragedy that the affair had to be made vegetarian. Yes, there would be piles of motorshutir kochuri with stuffed aloor dom and chholar dal with coconut bits. Yes, the old thakurs would whip up family secrets that would never ever be revealed to the Jaiswals. And yes, there would be five kinds of savoury fries, excluding mochar chop and five kinds of mishti, excluding doi. No chatter about calories would be entertained. No dahi vada, golgappa or that sort of rubbish would be served. They were the Ghoshes after all. And there was no question of serving any kind of fancy salad with imported leaves, olive oil and vinegar  only the time-honoured slices of cucumber, tomato and onion on a plate, along with mustard and mayonnaise.Lata had escaped the vice grip of relatives, who had far too many questions than she could handle and whose comments about how slim her waist still was and how expensive her sari looked were all lined with a certain malice. She now stood in a corner and exchanged notes about the next day with a surly Bobby. (Who looked smoky-eyed and bewitching in a black chikankari anarkali set with mukaish work on it.)Whos that? Bobby asked, suddenly interested in a man who had walked up to Nimki and had clasped her hands in his. He wore a beautifully tailored suit, in charcoal grey, and suddenly Lata found herself looking away.(To be continued)"

Hariharan has requested the Chief Wildlife Warden (CWW), Tamil Nadu, to take necessary steps to translocate a wild elephant that has been damaging crops and houses in the Thadagam valley near Coimbatore city.The letter was sent to the CWW on Tuesday, a day after 150 farmers from Thadagam valley petitioned the District Collector, seeking the translocation of wild elephants that are entering villages.The letter seeks capture and translocation of one male wild elephant while two male elephants -- Chinna Thambi and Vinayagan, as named by villagers -- were damaging crops in the valley.The letter said that a male wild elephant was causing problems to the farmers and the public in peripheral areas such as Varapalayam, Pannimadai, Periyathadagam, and Chinnathadagam for the last six months. The animal damaged crops such as tomato, maize, banana and coconut cultivated in areas adjoining the forest.Several steps have been taken by the Forest officials to drive the elephant into the deep forest. But, the elephant often returns to these places and causes damages, said the letter.In October and November, five persons were killed in the attack of wild elephants in Coimbatore Forest Division.The deceased included a member of a Rapid Response Team of the Forest Department engaged in frontline works.A senior official from the Forest Department said that it was for the CWW to take a final call on issuing orders to capture and translocate the wild elephant.Capture and translocation should be the last resort if other measures of mitigating the situation fail. The Forest Department is expected to take a decision which balances the Nature and the sentiments and concerns of the farmers, said Ajay Desai, consultant for the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and member of Asian elephants specialist group of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).P. Kandasamy, District Secretary of Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam, said the Forest Department should eliminate the animal if it was unable to translocate it. This request also was submitted to the Collector."

""Unfortunately Dr Jichkar is no more, but I decided to take his research further,"" said Dixit. Since increase of insulin in blood, usually released after meals, triggers obesity, insulin-resistance and type-2 diabetes, Dixit advises restricting all eating during the day to just two meals.""We appointed Dixit as brand ambassador after we found that his diet plan to tackle obesity and diabetes is yielding results,"" said BJP leader Girish Mahajan, who heads the medical education department.Dr Jagannath Dixit, who has been teaching for 26 years and has won several national and state awards, explained that if insulin level rises in blood, it can trigger many health hazards.Once insulin level rises, the body uses glucose for energy; and if insulin level falls, the body uses fatty acids. As baseline insulin secretion cannot be controlled voluntarily, one option is to control the number of times insulin is secreted into the blood after every eating episode. As more or less the same amount of insulin is secreted every time, irrespective of the quantity of food consumed, reducing eating frequency can reduce the insulin level. So, Dixit's advice is to eat twice when one is hungry; in between two meals, one can drink water, diluted, home-made buttermilk, green or black tea (without sugar), coconut water and one tomato.Dixit claims the simple lifestyle modification is effective in losing weight as well as diabetes reversal. ""If one follows the two-meal practice, I am sure there will not only be weight loss, but it will help in controlling diabetes. Reversal of diabetes is also possible,"" said Dixit.After naming Dixit the ambassador to spread awareness about fighting lifestyle diseases that are proving to be a huge burden for India as well as the state, Mahajan told TOI: ""We have launched a campaign to tackle obesity and diabetes. Dr Dixit has done his own research on the diet plan, obesity and diabetes. He has delivered lectures across the state and international platforms, too, and has come to certain conclusions. We felt it will be appropriate if we appoint him our brand ambassador, it will go a long way in promoting the message to fight obesity and diabetes.""Dixit has been a tireless campaigner for weight loss and reversal of diabetes for the last 10 years, spreading his message through 250 WhatsApp group and other social media platforms. He has more than 50,000 followers from 37 countries."

Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.Pune: In an eight-month low, the tomato prices in November have fallen to Rs3 to Rs6 per kilogram in the wholesale market. The prices are also significantly lower than the wholesale rates prevalent during the same time last year  tomatoes were being sold for between Rs12 and Rs35 per kg in November 2017.The retail price for this kitchen staple, however, is still steady at Rs20 per kg.In July this year, the price per kg of tomato in the wholesale market was between Rs5 and Rs 14. And the rates have been going south since then. They are now less than half of what they were in October and November 2017, the data available with the Pune Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) revealed.The tomato production this year was very good, despite drought-like conditions in parts of the state. APMC officials said the prices have dropped because the tomato supply to the wholesale market has increased.Last year, the prices were high during this period. Anticipating similar prices this year, the farmers cultivated more tomatoes in 2018 as well, said Vilas Bhujbal, the president of the Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard Traders and Agents Association. The farmers in one area grew more tomato crops without realising that their counterparts in other places too were planning on growing more tomatoes. This led to a glut in the market and the prices fell, Bhujbal added.The government should have a mechanism in place to avoid similar situations. The government should conduct studies using satellite imageries  to gauge the extent of agricultural land where a particular crop has been sown. Even the farmers can benefit from such knowledge. If too much of one particular crop has been sown in a season by some farmers, others can limit its cultivation by sowing other crops, he said.Sanjay Pawar, a farmer from Nashik, said tomato production has been bountiful in many locations this time. Apart from Nashik in Maharashtra, even places in Rajasthan and Gujarat have reported bountiful tomato crops. If production is high in Rajasthan and Gujarat as well, then there is always a possibility that tomatoes from Maharashtra will not be exported to those states as they too are experiencing a glut. Also, exports of vegetables to Pakistan have either stopped or slowed down, he said.Shriram Gadhave, the president of the Vegetables Growers Association of India, however, said that excess production of tomatoes in the current period is from regions where the water table has still not dipped considerably, despite the drought declared earlier.While tomato wholesale prices have come down, retail prices have stayed put at around Rs20 per kg. Yakub Pathan, owner of the Fresh Vegetable Market in Wakad, said, Wholesale tomato prices have come down to Rs3 to Rs6 per kg, but retailers are maintaining a status quo on the prices. Even if prices in the wholesale market increase to Rs10-Rs12 per kg, we will continue to sell tomatoes at Rs20."

Since the plastic ban will soon come into effect, people need to be educated about the various alternatives available to make the switch easier, he said.A total of 63 stalls have been set up with manufacturers exhibiting their products that include mini biogas plants and eco-friendly sanitary pads.Green India, a firm from Virudhunagar, has created pencils and pens made out of recycled plastic and have attached small seeds of chilli and tomatoes to make it attractive for children. Since a large amount of wood is used to produce pencils, we decided to make the change and attach seed pellets to the back of pencils. We make environment-friendly invitation cards too, said R. Nagarajan, the proprietor.Members of Kuppaikaran, an institution based out of Salem, said that they would soon be tying up with corporation schools to collect dry waste.We have launched a programme called Wealth and Wellness out of Waste where students can collect dry waste from homes and deposit it in boxes. Each standard has the ability to earn at least Rs. 2,500 every week if they contribute enough waste. We in turn sell it to recyclers. The system promotes waste segregation and educates children about reusing biodegradable waste, said N. Tamilmanian, one of the team members.Other stalls are selling packing material made from eco-friendly products like bamboo, arecanut and cassava starch. Corporation Commissioner S.

He began growing exotic vegetables like red cabbage, yellow cherry tomato, table radish, broccoli and turnip that have high value.He sells his produce to malls in Mysuru, Bengaluru, Goa and Hyderabad besides big vegetable shops. Now, he grows nearly 25 such varieties and has started exploring the online marketplace. We have created two clusters of farmers for growing foreign vegetable varieties organically. The intention is to ensure their availability at the doorsteps of consumers in Bengaluru and Mysuru through online markets, he says.The University of Agricultural Sciences-Bengaluru (UAS-B) on Friday honoured him with district-level best farmer award at Krishi Mela.More yieldAnother farmer to be honoured by the UAS-B on Friday was Siddappa. The 31-year-old hails from Taggaluru of Gundlupet taluk. He grows cotton, jowar, sugarcane and banana.But his innovation lies in maximising profit by taking up related works, including a plant nursery which fetches him about Rs. 15,000 a month. He has also set up a flour mill that works on his diesel-run tiller so that villagers need not depend on power supply for grinding grains."

Two persons including a young woman from Kerala died when a tree reportedly fell on the car she was travelling on the Kodaikanal ghat road on Friday morning and another farmer died in Vedasandur.Number of dwellings were damaged - fully and partially, low lying areas were inundated and there were complaints of flash floods in many areas. Since the TANGEDCO had switched off the electricity as a precaution, charging mobile phones became difficult and thus communication too was not possible during the day. In Dindigul city, rain water entered houses in Kakkan Nagar, Thirumalaisamypuram and other pockets. Trees were uprooted in RM Colony, MVM Nagar, NGO Colony and other stretches.According to Horticulture department officials, around 280 hectares of crops, including corn, plantain, mango, drumsticks, onion, hill banana, beans and tomato in Oddanchatram, Palani and Reddiarchatram were affected. The worst hit farms were in Kodaikanal hills. Collector T. G. Vinay, District Monitoring Officer Mangat Ram Sharma and other officials were closely monitoring the situation. As and when there were distress calls, the officials exclusively earmarked for carrying out rescue operations were rushed to the spot. Awareness to communicate and reach out to first responders saved many lives and cattle, an official told.Dam level upMany dams witnessed steady rise in inflow since forenoon. The Palar-Porundalar dam near Palani reached its full capacity. The Varadamanadhi dam was overflowing and about 6,000 cusecs of water was discharged from the reservoir. The Mavoor dam near Sirumalai had also touched its full capacity.Many pockets in and around Natham benefited from the rainfall. From as early as 3 a.m., Parali, Vathipatti, Ulupakudi, Koilpatti and other villages experienced steady rain. Tanks which were dry turned full within a few hours. The villagers, particularly, the elders expressed happiness as after nearly a decade a tank in Sithayankottai, near Athur was full. Likewise, Nochiodai tank in S Pudukottai near Krishnapuram too was full. A 100-year-old neem tree was uprooted in the rains in the town.Roads along Nilakottai, Chinnalapatti and Kanniwadi were badly damaged. Due to heavy rain and gusty wind, visibility was poor and many motorists took shelter as a precaution.Trains detainedTrains from Madurai bound for destinations like Mumbai suffered detention as the tracks were damaged. According to railway officials, the Nagercoil-Mumbai Express, Tirunelveli-Mayiladuthurai, Guruvayur-Chennai Express and others had to be detained in between Kodai Road and Ambatturai railway stations. Only after the repair works were carried out, the trains could pass the stretch at five kilometre speed.Two casualtiesTwo persons identified as Neelima, 25, wife of Jerinraj and their child Madhav, 2, were returning from Kodaikanal to Thrisur, Kerala. As the vehicle approached Kallaraimedu ghat section, a tree fell on the car, in which the woman died. In another incident, a 55-year-old man Karupasami of Venkatapuram, near Odaipatti in Oddanchatram taluk died when a tree fell on him.The rainfall recorded (in mm) in the district at 5.30 p.m. was as follows: Dindigul: 58.8, Kodaikanal: 138.50, Palani: 34.2, Chatrapatti (Oddanchatram): 26.2, Natham: 44, Nilakottai: 93, Vedasandur: 22, Vedasandur (Tobacco station): 22, Kamatchipuram: 60, Kodaikanal Boat Club: 130 mm.

She loves to cook and wrote her first recipe book, Miss Masala: Real Indian Cooking for Busy Living, around eight years ago. Mallika Basu  former Bengal chief minister Jyoti Basus granddaughter  has more kitchen wisdom and scrumptious meals to share in her second cookbook, Masala. Sprinkled with memories of Sunday lunches with her politician grandfather and secret recipes from her north Indian maternal grandmother, Mallika has whipped up a delicious hardback of slow feasts, classic curries, sweet treats, quick fixes and more. We caught up with her on an email chat.What inspired you to write a cookbook, as there are several on Indian cuisine already?This is a very personal book that was inspired by my own experience of trying to fit Indian cooking into a busy family, social and professional life.I use a lot of cookbooks and found myself finding ways to simplify the recipes in them and the recipe instructions being given to me by my family. A lot of Indian recipes are based on nostalgia and age-old traditions, but we dont live the way our parents and grandparents did. Even my mother (theatre veteran Dolly Basu) and her friends use great little shortcuts to make food simpler to cook and more wholesome.I found myself reaching for gadgets, innovative food products/ingredients, and easy cheats that dont compromise on flavour. I saw a gap in the market for an Indian cookbook that reflects the way we live now  for busy people, who dont have much help in the kitchen and want to get wholesome, delicious food on the table for friends and family.The design aesthetic of contemporary India was also important for me to reflect. The Western view of India is all elephants and paisley, despite the beautiful, minimalist Indian design I have been enjoying. We were keen to capture the texture and colours of handloom, architecture and nature in the look and feel of the book.How did you go about curating the dishes?I started with mealtime moments. We Indians love our breakfast, and there is a huge trend of lazy brunches, so that had to be a chapter. I also love entertaining, so feasts needed to feature. Then I included family favourites from my homes in Calcutta and London. A lot of recipes from Delhi feature, where my mum is from and where I worked briefly. Then there are several Bengali recipes. But importantly, we were a cosmopolitan bunch and recipes from other communities featured too. I am very influenced by Gujarati food, for instance, and I travelled extensively in Kerala, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and even researched Calcutta food. So recipes from there feature too.Masala has many anecdotes from your childhood, involving your grandfather Jyoti Basu. What was your relationship with him like?It was like any other relationship between a doting grandfather and his besotted granddaughter. Dadu called me his crown princess and was keenly interested in my academic and other achievements. When I participated in a beauty contest and came last, it didnt stop him from driving his convoy straight to our home and chanting beauty queen, beauty queen as he came up the stairs to see me. He looked so glum in photos but he sprung to life and smiles when he was around us. When I got married, his one concern was that I would give up my career. So I think hed be proud that I have not one but three full-blown ones, including motherhood!Any food memory from your childhood that comes to mind?Sunday lunch was a big tradition at our home (in Salt Lake). I always remember lazy afternoons with lilting Bollywood tunes, vodka cocktails for the grown-ups, my dad (Chandan Basu) stirring slowly and the kids filling up on chanachur while lunch took ages to cook. I also have not-so-fond memories of driving my mother crazy at mealtimes. I was a very fussy eater and skinny child. My poor mother oversaw the most amazing food, which I would reject without even trying. I did eventually grow out of it though, as is probably evident!An easy version of burgers  Chappli Kebab Picture from Mallikas InstagramIn the book, you mention that you have been influenced by your maternal grandmother a lot...Nani is a proper matriarch with Afghan blood in her. She was actively involved in our parenting and a strong influence on food, culture and others. I used to travel with her to Delhi for my winter holidays and have the best time. She gave up non-vegetarian food when she lost her husband, but still cooked excellent chicken curry. Thanks to her, I enjoyed the best of Delhi home cooking  rajma chawal, kadhi pakora, gajar methi, and parathas stuffed with absolutely everything.I called her when I was writing Masala and we had an awkward conversation, as she is hard of hearing, until I asked her for her recipe of nimbu ka achaar. She sprung to life and after much testing, the recipe has now been perfected for modern kitchens and is in my book.To be honest, I had all manner of busy people in mind. A lot of my followers are young families, professionals without kids and silver surfers who are enjoying their kitchens and cooking in a new way. I live in London, so some of the recipes do need to be adapted for international kitchens but its never complicated and nothing an instinctive regular cook cant manage. I know a lot of Indians who move away from home to study, or to get married or for work. They buy my book because they find the recipes are so doable and always taste right.In the age of quick tutorial videos, do you see a cookbook being relevant?Absolutely. Quick tutorial videos are great, but there is only so much you can cram into a short video. Cookbooks are increasingly being bought for longevity, because they offer something over and beyond just recipes. A video tutorial can never replace that.Is cooking a passion or is it just a hobby or something more?All of the above. I find it very relaxing and often cook after a long day to unwind. But more than that I am passionate about addressing misperceptions about Indian cooking that exist. Its not as complicated, difficult and time consuming as people think. Thats what got me writing about food. All you need is know-how, great recipes and a fantastic cookbook.Channa Dal, Mustard Prawn Curry, and two favourites  Peas Pulao and Saag Aloo Picture from Mallikas InstagramAt home, what kind of cooking would we find in your kitchen?I often use my own cookbook, so thats very much the kind of Indian food you would eat if you came to my home. I love other cuisines, and so Indian dishes take pride of place alongside Chinese, Japanese, Persian, Italian and much more. My family loves variety; the kids especially are gourmet babies, with a very wide-ranging palate and love for food and cooking. So its a mixed bag. The food is always wholesome, well balanced and simply cooked.What kind of influence does your husbands half-Peruvian and half-British heritage have on your cooking?I was quite lucky that Peruvians like flavour and lots of chillies! I never had to tone down our spicier dishes for him... We met at university in London through Gujarati friends and the rest, as they say, is history!How much of Indian culture are your kids exposed to?They call themselves half-Indian and love dressing up in their festive Indian clothes and eating Indian food. I often make dosas and chillas at home for weekend breakfast, which they eat before you can wink. And they love going on holiday to India. Sadly, I havent been great at teaching them Hindi or Bengali. Still they are only small so there is hope!How do you make time for this alongside a career in communications?They say if you want something done, give it to a busy person! But seriously, I have been very blessed with the support of my husband, my family and friends. I also gave up a full-time role in communications in favour of consulting, so I now have a portfolio career that allows me the flexibility of enjoying my day job and indulging my passion. Hopefully, I am living proof of my own unique difference  that I am a busy home cook writing delicious recipes that work for other busy home cooks.What is next in the cooking space for you?I am still busy promoting the book and it is such a labour of love that I am trying to slow down and savour every minute. Watch this space for my next venture!Macchli Curry (Simple Fish Curry) Source: MasalaRecipe for Macchli Curry(Simple Fish Curry) (Serves 2-4)Coated in turmeric and chilli and simmered in a gently spiced curry, this is a very simple way to enjoy fish with the lightest of spices. Fish in India comes from both the fresh waters of its lakes and rivers and from the sea. Although foreign varieties such as basa are gaining popularity in restaurants and supermarkets, the morning trip to the fish market for the catch of the day remains a firm tradition in the fish-loving states. In Bengal, for instance, this is traditionally a job for the man of the house, who prides himself on his masterful bargaining with the sellers.

5ce6e139e8e3fc56af415af6,There are more than a 100 varieties of pasta!,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/food/there-are-more-than-a-100-varieties-of-pasta/cid/1675208,2018-11-14,,Telegraph,"Chefs Piero Ditrizio (left) and Simone de Siato after the masterclass at the IIHM Calcutta Gourmet Studio Pictures: Arnab Mondal and Rashbehari DasIIHM Calcutta signed an MoU with Intrecci and Campus Etoile Academy. To mark the occasion, a specially curated evening of Italian Gastronomy  Il Tavola Italiano, was organised. We spoke to the two Italian chefs -- Piero Ditrizio and Simone de SiatoWhat is a typical meal like in an Italian home?Simone: When it comes to Italian cuisine, regions have major roles to play. Everything we eat at home is totally dominated by the region we are in.Piero: In the south of Italy people eat a lot of eggplant. You will find heavy use of olive oil in the southern part, whereas in the north, the use of butter is more. So food varies according to the region. Nowadays you will find chefs creating and fusing different regions in the food they make but predominantly, Italian cuisine is about following and sticking to tradition.What are the must-have ingredients in Italian cuisine?Simone: Tomato, olive oil, basil, parmesan, balsamic vinegar, mascarpone and pasta. One of the most prominent features of the cuisine is that everything is fresh, so that you get the real taste of the ingredients. South of Italy uses a lot of rice while the use of wheat is more in the northern region. One thing common to both the regions is tomato.What lies behind the appeal of Italian cuisine?Piero: Italian cuisine is quite simple. The ingredients are low-fat and theres no overcooking involved. Olive oil is good for health. The use of butter is minimal.What are the different kinds of pasta?Simone: There are more than 100 varieties! This again depends on the region. You can make 10 different types of pasta with a single dough. Making pasta is something we learn at home as a child. Everything is handmade, rolled by hand too. There are two main types  fresh and dry. Dry pasta is industrial pasta. Its made with semolina flour and the quality of semolina is very important. If the texture of the pasta is smooth, it isnt good. It should be a little rough so that it can retain the sauce. The temperature at which pasta is dried is important too. Pasta should be dried at a low temperature. The more time it takes for the pasta to dry, the more time it takes to cook and the better is the mouthfeel. Fresh pasta is anyway rough because its handmade.Do Italian families bond over cooking?Piero: Family is something that plays an important role, it forms the base. Recipes from grandmothers and mothers are preserved in Italian households. The traditional recipes are important to us, be it for pastas or pastries. Even if I make my own creations, its important to form the base which has its roots in the traditional recipes and ingredients.Any myths you would want to bust about Italian food?Simone: We have many other desserts other than Tiramisu, like Baba with Rum. Also, we dont eat as much cheese as people think we do. People go for pizza once a week, it isnt something that we eat all the time."
5ce6e18be8e3fc56af415b3e,"Gene-edited food is coming, but will shoppers buy?",http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2018/nov/14/gene-edited-food-is-coming-but-will-shoppers-buy-1898217.html,2018-11-14,,The New Indian Express,"By Associated PressWASHINGTON: The next generation of biotech food is headed for the grocery aisles, and first up maybe salad dressings or granola bars made with soybean oil genetically tweaked to be good for your heart.By early next year, the first foods from plants or animals that had their DNA ""edited"" are expected to begin selling. It's a different technology than today's controversial ""genetically modified"" foods, more like faster breeding that promises to boost nutrition, spur crop growth, and make farm animals hardier and fruits and vegetables last longer.The U.S. National Academy of Sciences has declared gene editing one of the breakthroughs needed to improve food production so the world can feed billions more people amid a changing climate. Yet governments are wrestling with how to regulate this powerful new tool. And after years of confusion and rancor, will shoppers accept gene-edited foods or view them as GMOs in disguise?""If the consumer sees the benefit, I think they'll embrace the products and worry less about the technology,"" said Dan Voytas, a University of Minnesota professor and chief science officer for Calyxt Inc., which edited soybeans to make the oil heart-healthy.Researchers are pursuing more ambitious changes: Wheat with triple the usual fiber, or that's low in gluten. Mushrooms that don't brown, and better-producing tomatoes. Drought-tolerant corn, and rice that no longer absorbs soil pollution as it grows. Dairy cows that don't need to undergo painful de-horning, and pigs immune to a dangerous virus that can sweep through herds.Scientists even hope gene editing eventually could save species from being wiped out by devastating diseases like citrus greening, a so far unstoppable infection that's destroying Florida's famed oranges.First they must find genes that could make a new generation of trees immune.""If we can go in and edit the gene, change the DNA sequence ever so slightly by one or two letters, potentially we'd have a way to defeat this disease,"" said Fred Gmitter, a geneticist at the University of Florida Citrus Research and Education Center, as he examined diseased trees in a grove near Fort Meade.GENETICALLY MODIFIED OR EDITED, WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?Farmers have long genetically manipulated crops and animals by selectively breeding to get offspring with certain traits. It's time-consuming and can bring trade-offs. Modern tomatoes, for example, are larger than their pea-sized wild ancestor, but the generations of cross-breeding made them more fragile and altered their nutrients.GMOs, or genetically modified organisms, are plants or animals that were mixed with another species' DNA to introduce a specific trait  meaning they're ""transgenic."" Best known are corn and soybeans mixed with bacterial genes for built-in resistance to pests or weed killers.Despite international scientific consensus that GMOs are safe to eat, some people remain wary and there is concern they could spur herbicide-resistant weeds.Now gene-editing tools, with names like CRISPR and TALENs, promise to alter foods more precisely, and at less cost, without necessarily adding foreign DNA. Instead, they act like molecular scissors to alter the letters of an organism's own genetic alphabet.The technology can insert new DNA, but most products in development so far switch off a gene, according to University of Missouri professor Nicholas Kalaitzandonakes.Those new Calyxt soybeans? Voytas' team inactivated two genes so the beans produce oil with no heart-damaging trans fat and that shares the famed health profile of olive oil without its distinct taste.The hornless calves? Most dairy Holsteins grow horns that are removed for the safety of farmers and other cows. Recombinetics Inc. swapped part of the gene that makes dairy cows grow horns with the DNA instructions from naturally hornless Angus beef cattle.""Precision breeding,"" is how animal geneticist Alison Van Eenennaam of the University of California, Davis, explains it. ""This isn't going to replace traditional breeding,"" but make it easier to add one more trait.RULES AREN'T CLEARThe Agriculture Department says extra rules aren't needed for ""plants that could otherwise have been developed through traditional breeding,"" clearing the way for development of about two dozen gene-edited crops so far.In contrast, the Food and Drug Administration in 2017 proposed tighter, drug-like restrictions on gene-edited animals. It promises guidance sometime next year on exactly how it will proceed.Because of trade, international regulations are ""the most important factor in whether genome editing technologies are commercialized,"" USDA's Paul Spencer told a meeting of agriculture economists.Europe's highest court ruled last summer that existing European curbs on the sale of transgenic GMOs should apply to gene-edited foods, too.But at the World Trade Organization this month, the U.S. joined 12 nations including Australia, Canada, Argentina and Brazil in urging other countries to adopt internationally consistent, science-based rules for gene-edited agriculture.ARE THESE FOODS SAFE?The biggest concern is what are called off-target edits, unintended changes to DNA that could affect a crop's nutritional value or an animal's health, said Jennifer Kuzma of the Genetic Engineering and Society Center at North Carolina State University.Scientists are looking for any signs of problems. Take the hornless calves munching in a UC-Davis field. One is female and once it begins producing milk, Van Eenennaam will test how similar that milk's fat and protein composition is to milk from unaltered cows.""We're kind of being overly cautious,"" she said, noting that if eating beef from naturally hornless Angus cattle is fine, milk from edited Holsteins should be, too.But to Kuzma, companies will have to be up-front about how these new foods were made and the evidence that they're healthy. She wants regulators to decide case-by-case which changes are no big deal, and which might need more scrutiny.""Most gene-edited plants and animals are probably going to be just fine to eat. But you're only going to do yourself a disservice in the long run if you hide behind the terminology,"" Kuzma said.AVOIDING A BACKLASHUncertainty about regulatory and consumer reaction is creating some strange bedfellows. An industry-backed group of food makers and farmers asked university researchers and consumer advocates to help craft guidelines for ""responsible use"" of gene editing in the food supply.""Clearly this coalition is in existence because of some of the battle scars from the GMO debates, there's no question about that,"" said Greg Jaffe of the food-safety watchdog Center for Science in the Public Interest, who agreed to join the Center for Food Integrity's guidelines group. ""There's clearly going to be questions raised about this technology.""SUSTAINABILITY OR HYPE?Gene-editing can't do everything, cautioned Calyxt's Voytas. There are limitations to how much foods could be changed. Sure, scientists made wheat containing less gluten, but it's unlikely to ever be totally gluten-free for people who can't digest that protein, for example  or to make, say, allergy-free peanuts.Nor is it clear how easily companies will be able to edit different kinds of food, key to their profit.Despite her concerns about adequate regulation, Kuzma expects about 20 gene-edited crops to hit the U.S. market over five years  and she notes that scientists also are exploring changes to crops, like cassava, that are important in the poorest countries.""We think it's going to really revolutionize the industry,"" she said."

Identifying with the undistinguished common man, however, comes to them only during 'demanding' situations like an election campaign.The current election is also throwing up some interesting situations involving leaders from across the spectrum joining the man on the street to do what the latter are doing.Ironing clothesFor example, during the last one month of campaigning, the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) candidate for Adilabad Assembly constituency, Jogu Ramanna, who is Forest Minister in the caretaker Cabinet, was seen selling tomatoes in Quila area or ironing clothes at a laundry in Chota Talab locality or playing Boddemma or Bathukamma with women in localities like Kolipura in Adilabad town. Our people are happy to receive these leaders though they are visiting the locality only after four-and-a-half years,"" Aindla Chinna Lasmanna, a resident of Chota Talab generalised as he dwelt upon the trend of leaders personally calling upon voters during the run up to the election.""For the next five years, they will not even roll down the window glasses of their cars to acknowledge our presence,"" he added rather philosophically. There are other leaders too who have tried their hand at shaving while seeking votes at a hair dressers shop or made rotis using firewood while visiting slums. The voters are definitely amused but it is anybody's guess if such gestures influence them.Setting the trendThe trend of politicians indulging in activities which show them as caring personalities was laid by Eenadu Telugu daily in 1982 when it started publishing pictures of thespian N.T. Rama Rao breaking bread with poor families in their meagre homes or taking bath at a road side bore-well during his maiden campaign in the 1983 election for Andhra Pradesh Assembly.The pictures were received well by the public at large, evident from the fact they supported the Telugu Desam Party headed by the actor-turned-politician in that election.In the 2014 election, senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh had extended a helping hand to a tea seller who had set up his push cart at Boath village in Boath (ST) Assembly constituency during his party's election campaign. His action is still remembered by voters of the village."

Silver anklets made in Salem are popular across the country and worldwide and the industry employs a large work force round the year.A resolution adopted at the 16th district level conference of the DYFI here recently said that online trading had hit the silver crafts industry to a big extent and urged the government ban the same.Another resolution said that a large number of farmers were involved in raising flowers in Panamarathupatti and surrounding villages. They were not getting adequate price during the lean period. The government should take initiative to set up a perfume unit in Panaimarathupatti to benefit these farmers.Similarly, Mecheri and surrounding areas were famous for tomatoes. The tasty Mecheri tomatoes had good demand even in the neighbouring states. The setting up of a tomato juice manufacturing unit in Mecheri would immensely benefit the farmers in improving their livelihood.Yet another resolution demanded creation of additional infrastructure in the Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital.The government should remove encroachments from its lands and provide the same as free house site pattas to the weaker sections, and initiate steps to protect the handloom and powerloom units situated in and around Jalagandapuram.P.

It also aims to begin commercial production of cow urine and cowdung cakes. Unlike Chhattisgarh, it hasn't called for prohibition but vows to rid MP of 'intoxicants'.To address upper-caste resentment after amendment of the SC/ST Atrocities (Prevention) Act, the Congress Vachan Patra promises a Samanya Varg Ayog or Commission for general categories to address their issues.The manifesto was released at the state Congress headquarters here on Saturday morning by PCC chief Kamal Nath, state election campaign chairman Jyotiraditya Scindia, former CM Digvijaya Singh, Leader of Opposition Ajay Singh, and former Union ministers Suresh Pachauri and Arun Yadav. Chairman of the manifesto committee Rajendra Singh was also on dais.Congress described it as the voice of people of Madhya Pradesh. There is something for just about everyone  daily wagers, jobless, industrialists, homemakers and even journalists (a law to protect mediapersons), but the focus is clearly on farms and job creation.Kamal Nath told reporters, Congress is not releasing a manifesto for the people of the state. Rather, this is our pledge to bring Madhya Pradesh back on the tracks of development so that farmers can smile, women will feel protected and youth can get employment. In the last 15 years, BJP presented only jumla patras (propaganda deeds) in the name of manifesto and deceived people. Congress is determined to end corruption and mafia rule which starts from villages.Scindia called it a a new morning after 15 years of darkness for farmers, women and youth. Congress has presented its resolution, not just a manifesto, out of the willingness to serve. We have promised progress and development, plus reduction in price of petrol and diesel, justice for slain farmers of Mandsaur and distribution of free laptops to meritorious students in every district. Women will be given priority during recruitment in police force. Industry will be promoted so jobs are created. And all this will be implemented with a specified time limit.Apart from agricultural loan waiver up to Rs 2 lakh, Congress promises 50% waiver on electric bills for agrarian sector, grant of Rs 51,000 for marriage of young women, and salary subsidy of Rs 10,000 to firms to encourage employment generation and investment. The manifesto assures passing a law for right to housing. Rest houses will be built every 15km along the Naramda Parikrama route.The Vachan Patra says that if Congress comes to power, it will bring transparency in recruitments and appointments and Vyapam  which has been in the eye of a storm for eight years  will be shut down. Congress alleges the BJP governments involvement in Vyapam irregularities.Congress manifesto promises more than the BJP governments policies at the Centre and state. While chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan promised bonus on grains like wheat and dal, Congress promises to give bonus to farmers on practically every major crop grown in the state  wheat, paddy, jowar, bajra, corn, soybean, mustard, cotton, arhar, moong, gram and masoor, urad, garlic, onions, tomatoes and sugarcane. The Narendra Modi government in Delhi gave LPG connections to the poor through Ujjwala Yojana, and Congress promises Rs 100 subsidy per cylinder. It plans to raise social security pension from Rs 300 per month to Rs 1,000.We are going to the people with a new thought process, to give the state a new direction, said LOP Ajay Singh."

But we had a look at the manic traffic, and changed our minds. Just the day before, I had been caught in the traffic for what seemed like hours. So, I decided that Id look up Zomato and order something exciting from our part of town.A few minutes of surfing later, I zeroed in on what looked promising  a delivery outlet called Rendezvous Calcutta in Noida. I called up and was told that it has been around for a while, has mostly Bengali food and delivers through Swiggy.Fresh and well-cookedI had an interesting chat with Chef Madhumita, who runs the place (phone numbers: 0120-4267726 and 8826743456). The food is all prepared fresh, so they have to be given some time to cook and deliver. The recipes are authentic, she said, and brushed off one of the Bengali food delivery places that I rather like as not genuine. And she helped me choose our order. We decided on a plate of dhokar dalna (Rs. 160), aloo posto (Rs. 145), shukto (Rs. 145), bori-aloo maachh jhol (Rs. 255), maachher kalia (Rs. 210) and tomato chatni (Rs. 70).The food came within the hour. And we had a delicious lunch, for the dishes, as the chef had promised, were fresh and well cooked. I had the dhokar dalna, which is a dish of steamed besan cakes in thick gravy that I really enjoy. It was superb; the cakes were soft, and the gravy was nice and tasty. I like my aloo posto with more posto (khus-khus, or poppy seed paste) than aloo, but in many kitchens it is cooked the other way around. In Rendezvous, too, it was more of a potato dish than posto. But it had a nice flavourful taste.The shukto, which is usually a cooling summer dish of vegetables in a light sauce, was delicious. It had a mix of vegetables, and the right balance of mildly sweet and bitter tastes. The two fish dishes were outstanding. There were large chunks of potato and fried bori (lentil balls) in bori-aloo maachh jhol, while the maachher kalia gravy was rich and sumptuous. The fish was fresh, and the pieces were large. Most of the gravies were hot, which I enjoyed after months of a low chilli diet. The tomato chatni, however, wasnt all that exciting. I must say Ive had better.Elaborate menuI didnt try out the meat dishes, but will order in another day. They have kosha mutton (Rs. 210), railway mutton (Rs. 375), chicken rezala (Rs. 375) and chicken curry (Rs. 360). There are other kinds of fish dishes, too  such as pabda tomato jhal (Rs. 240) and shorshe pabda (Rs. 230). Vegetarians can try out the aloor dum (Rs. 120), phul kopir dalna (Rs. 145), doi potol (Rs. 145), chholar dal (Rs. 100) and begun bhaja (Rs. 50). They have biryanis and rolls, breakfast fare such as radha bollobhi (stuffed puris with aloo) and snacks such as fish fries and chops.Madhumita tells me that she is not a trained chef, but has always been interested in cooking. She used to be a marketing professional, and then decided to get into the food business. I am glad she did!"

In Thuppaki , we saw that when Vijay gets the help of his fellow army men to stop terrorist attacks happening across the city.In Kaththi , we saw it when Vijay ropes in senior citizens to stop water supply to the city. Even in the recent Spyder, we saw the hero (Mahesh Babu) getting the help of housewives to stop a crime.Sarkar has a long run-time but lacks that one Brand ARM sequence that could have changed the tone of the film. At 163 minutes, it comes across more like a political pamphlet.Vijay is named Sundar Ramaswamy in the film and it looks like his name was coined by mixing the names of Googles CEO and Chennais firebrand activist who has traffic for a sobriquet. Hes globally renowned to be a corporate monster who takes over companies wherever he goes, but hes now in India to cast his vote. But theres a hitch: his vote has already been cast.That much has already been revealed thanks to the trailers, and the first half of Sarkar thankfully takes it one step further. Theres an evil politician (Masilamani, played by Pazha Karuppiah, and as clichd as they come) who is out to ruin the state. Can Sundar  with all his corporate experience (he calls himself a corporate criminal)  stop him from that? Can Sundars wisdom come in handy in rectifying malpractice that has become quite prevalent in Tamil Nadu polls?It is a promising premise and a much-needed one, considering that all of us yearn for change and development, but Sarkar just scratches the surface by putting together a story based on a few recent incidents in the State. It reels off laws and the electoral processes (theres an entire eye-opening-but-lecture-like stretch on Section 49P) just to support Vijays decision to stay back in Chennai and clean the system.The problem with Sarkar is that it has no well-defined characters. Keerthy Suresh has nothing much to do than keep walking with Vijay (literally) while Yogi Babu has a blink-and-miss appearance. It is Varalaxmi who steals the cake, essaying a smooth performance. Sarkar would have been better off had she been introduced earlier.The dialogues, though powerful, reel off much longer than they ought to be. What could have been said in two words: Go vote (admittedly a much-needed social message) gets the entire length of the film, replete with dance and fights.Theres an entire sequence featuring Vijay narrating the story of a tomato that got the claps, but looks oddly out of place. But in these dialogue-heavy sequences that Vijay gets into the act  his control over the emotional sequences is admirable, while hes aggressive in the ones that require him to go a little over-the-top.AR Rahmans songs dont help him much  except the call-for-revolution number Oru Viral, they dont contribute much to take the story forward.Watching Sarkar , I kept thinking of an earlier much-loved Murugadoss film, Ramana (2002), which had Vijayakant taking on corrupt officials. That had the protagonist as a professor but it is Sarkar that feels like the lecture."

The scheme was announced in the budget speech of 2018-19 with an outlay of Rs 500 crore to stabilize the supply of tomato, onion and potato (TOP) and to ensure availability of these crops throughout the country round-the-year without price volatility.Union food processing industry minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, in a press release on Monday, said, Price volatility of TOP crops wreak havoc in the households of this country. This scheme has been prepared after sustained talks with all stakeholders and we will ensure that the TOP crops reach all households in the country all through the year.She said the government had laid down special measures and grants-in-aid under the scheme to ensure enhanced production of TOP crops and to augment value chain. Operation Greens aims to enhance the value realisation of TOP farmers by targeted interventions. These interventions would range from strengthening of production clusters and farmer producer organisations (FPOs) and connecting them with the market to price stabilisation for both producers and consumers through a proper production planning. The measures would include introduction of dual use varieties, reduction in post-harvest losses by creation of farm gate infrastructure, development of suitable agro-logistics, creation of appropriate storage facilities linking consumption centres and increase in food processing capacities. Operation Greens also envisages setting up of a market intelligence network to collect and collate real time data on demand and supply and price of TOP crops.The ministry would provide 50% of subsidy on transportation of TOP crops from production to storage and hiring of appropriate storage facilities, the minister stated."

The prices of other vegetables too were hovering low and the cultivators lamented that it did not even meet their cost of transportation.A. Nagaraju, one of the farmers and who is part of the Raita Mitra company, blamed the APMC officials for being apathetic to the plight of the farmers.Though the Agricultural Price Commission has stipulated that the procurement price should never be below the cost of cultivation it is not implemented and the brokers and middlemen have a field day, he added.Airing concern over the developments, Mr. Nagaraju said only lip sympathy is given to the cause of the farmers but no practical initiatives are taken to bail them out of crisis. Vegetable producers have demanded storage facility with refrigeration, tie-up with food industry for direct procurement from farmers but none of it has been implemented, he added. The bulk of vegetables cultivated in and around Mysuru are brought to the APMC yard which receives produce from Kolar, Nagamangala, Mandya, Hassan and other places. In addition, Jayapura, Hampapura, H.D. Kote, T. Narsipur etc are other places in Mysuru district where vegetables are cultivated on a large scale."

I am always blown away by the quality of food and wine, informed, friendly service and charming down-to-earth no-nonsense Australian attitude to life. There is a humility and dignity which is refreshing and very new world. Sydney is the perfect first stop Down Under and what a foodie paradise it is!Start your journey on Singapore Airlines, not the national carrier Qantas. You wont regret it. Apart from the seamless service, great big seats and plenty of legroom, the food and drinks are outstanding. SIA has won the prestigious award for the Best Overall Wine Cellar 2017.If youre in the rarefied atmosphere of first class, they serve Krug 2004 Champagne and one of the best Aussie wines, a Pinot Noir from Paringa Estate. In business and in all the lounges, youll be very happy with the delicious Charles Heidsieck Brut Reserve. The food is designed by a panel of international chefs, so youll find Indian, Asian and Australian menus on routes Down Under and fabulous illy single-origin coffees, TWG teas, cocktails and mocktails, all served with a smile.Sydney SeaplanesReady for a bit of the high life? The luxury seaplane operator offers sightseeing tours in a classic Beaver aircraft. Whether its a scenic flight over the beautiful Sydney Harbour, a flying journey of the golden sandy Northern Beaches, a romantic picnic for two on a secluded beach, or the best taxi ride to one of Sydneys river or ocean restaurants  Sydney Seaplanes will get you there in style. They take off from Rose Bay, which you can reach by either taxi or even better, a lovely inexpensive ferry ride from Circular Quay. On a fine day, the dashing young pilots in shorts are happy to take you on a scenic tour of Sydney over the Opera House and Harbour Bridge, down along many of Sydneys beautiful northern beaches and harbours to our destination, which happened to be Whale Beach, a stretch of pristine white sand and spectacular views. It would normally take an hour or so to reach here by car from Sydney but in the seaplane it takes only 20 minutes.Tasmanian Pacific Oysters with rice wine vinaigrette at Tetsuyas, which is owned by Tetsuya Wakuda (below) Sourced by The TelegraphTetsuyas restaurantYes, believe it or not, there are some really world-class food experiences to be had in the city. One of my favourite fine dining restaurants is Tetsuyas, which combines a masterful blend of skill, artistry and taste. Tetsuya Wakudas attention to detail is consistent and beyond sublime. Signature dishes include the confit of Ocean trout, consomme of tomato and tea, Tasmanian Pacific oysters with rice wine vinaigrette, tuna with daikon and wasabi, sea scallops with lemonade fruit and yuzu, and the sashimi of hamachi (kingfish) with blood orange and vinaigrette.The petuna ocean trout dish has been served in the restaurant ever since it was a humble first-floor dwelling in a very ordinary suburb of Sydney. Tetsuya was the first chef to discover this fish and to source many wonderful products from all over Australia. Do not leave without trying the warm kombu bread and truffle butter served regularly in between courses. Not that you need any more food but this is a must-do. Tetsuyas only does a degustation menu  10 courses paired with world wines. There is no a la carte. Each dish is truly a culinary masterpiece. If you have the time, budget and inclination (youll have to reserve way in advance), dont miss it. Aus $240 pp for the whole experience.Bondi Beach Sourced by The TelegraphBondi BeachI heard plenty about Bondi Beach but had not realised that it has a sub-culture of its own. Its not just a series of serious beaches (Bondi/Tamarama/Bronte) but an area of great restaurants, cafes and shops which makes Bondi a real Sydney suburb worth talking about well beyond the hippie image it once had. Musts to visit in the area are Camilla for silk kaftans, Gertrude & Alice for books and coffee, and Icebergs for the most spectacular lunch overlooking Bondi Beach. Its not just a restaurant serving outstanding food (not surprisingly a huge variety of seafood and Italian), its a style statement. And dont forget to listen to Bondi 88 FM, the local radio station, while you are there.Jonahs offers an excellent view and seafood Sourced by The TelegraphJonahsPerhaps the only feature that can divert your attention from the stunning view at Jonahs is the exceptional food and wine offering. The award-winning hatted restaurant offers excellent contemporary Australian cuisine under the direction of chef Matteo Zamboni. They were the recipient of Australias Wine List of the Year Awards in 2017 by Gourmet Traveller with a cellar containing over 11,000 bottles of vintage Australian and international wines and a wine list of more than 1,600 different labels.Apart from the fabulous food and wine, Jonahs is a little luxury getaway with 11 beautiful rooms, all with stunning sea views, a spa and all the trimmings. The seafood platter for lunch which consists of a deck of raw and cured fish and oysters to crayfish thermidor and warm Coffin Bay scallops along with a glass of Aussie Arras sparkling, is a must-have. And yes, an added bonus is that you can spot whales as they migrate between May and November.Sydney Opera House Sourced by The TelegraphSydney Opera HouseGo for a guided tour or, even better, go see an opera at any of their six halls. Join the one-hour Essential Tour and see inside the World Heritage-listed House. Your guide will show you the theatres and stages where more than 1,600 performances come to life annually. Youll see some of the thousand rooms and 300 corridors of the building. Youll leave this tour with a fascinating account of the Houses history and architecture  its an exciting introduction to Sydneys vibrant performing arts scene.QT Sydney shares the building with two historical buildings, Gowings and The State Theatre Sourced by The TelegraphQT SydneyA new Australian brand of hospitality, QT Sydney had a much-anticipated opening this year and is the only Sydney hotel to be a member of the exclusive Design Hotels. Rocking the city with their edgy, quirky design, happening F&B spaces, bars and beautifully decorated contemporary rooms, QT Sydney shares the building with two of the citys most majestic historical buildings, Gowings and The State Theatre. The eccentricity of the hotel is offset by the historical features of the building, such as the blend of gothic, art deco, and Italian-influenced architecture. Although I didnt stay at the QT, the vibe intrigued me as I walked in off the busy and bustling Market Street where most of the high-end shopping, restaurants and bars are. I was hoping that quirky didnt stretch to the bedrooms and was pleasantly surprised at the comfort level of their spacious rooms. Apart from this, it seems to be the place for the wild, wacky and cool crowd to party.A salad of spring peas stracciatella, smoked almonds, rye crumble, asparagus and tomato chutney Sourced by The TelegraphBennelong RestaurantUpmarket yet relaxed, Bennelong Restaurant is an absolute treat for lunch. The bar is literally under the Opera Houses shell vaulted sails with spectacular views over the Harbour Bridge. The restaurant with huge glass panels overlooks Circular Quay and the Harbour. The menu is based on award-winning chef Peter Gilmores vision of Australian cuisine. Incidentally, he also runs the other culinary icon in Sydney, Quay restaurant which is just opposite. You can choose from a two- or three-course a la carte menu with service starting early, catering to the pre-theatre dining crowd. Dishes to go for are the salad of spring peas, smoked almonds, asparagus and tomato chutney; wild cape york barramundi and the mooloolaba yellowfin tuna with kohlrabi remoulade. Benelong offers 180 of the countrys favourite and small-scale wine labels from an eclectic collection of winemakers. This is quintessential Sydney for me.An usual evening at Bennelong Restaurant Sourced by The TelegraphSydney fish market Sourced by The TelegraphSydney fish marketFirstly, unlike many fish markets I have visited round the world, it doesnt smell fishy. The variety of Australian seafood alone is quite staggering  from Tasmanian giant abalone and crabs weighing 17kg to prawns, crayfish, Moreton Bay bugs, marons, Balmain bay bugs (all Aussie crustaceans), rock lobster and, of course, oysters galore. Each fishmonger in addition to selling fish has ready-to-eat dishes, including sushi, lobster thermidor and shucked oysters. If that isnt enough, there are plenty of restaurants both within the market and outside where you can enjoy a seafood lunch in comfort.On the first floor is the Sydney seafood school, which conducts cookery classes. On certain days of the week, they also have master classes by Sydneys top chefs. Although most of the classes are over $100 for a two- or three-hour class, lunch or dinner and a glass of wine is included. For someone who really enjoys cooking, this is a must-do. Classes run throughout the week but there seems to be a better choice over the weekend. Check for substantial discounts if youre a group of six or more.Hyatt Sydney Sourced by The TelegraphRock a 180-degree viewLocation. Location. Location. Whoever said that must have been thinking about the Hyatt Sydney. Right opposite the Opera House, under the Harbour Bridge on the edge of the fashionable area known as The Rocks, the Park Hyatt is the place to stay in Sydney if you want a view to beat all views. Choose one of the suites on the circular front of the hotel and youll have a 180-degree view of the Opera House as your 25ft electric curtains draw open. It also has one of the citys nicest restaurants on the ground floor facing the boardwalk and Sydney Harbour.Karen Anand is a culinary consultant, food writer and entrepreneur.

5ce746b3e8e3fc56af41853d,A moveable street feast in Calcutta,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/a-moveable-street-feast-in-calcutta/cid/1673726,2018-11-03,,Telegraph,"A walk down a sidewalk in Calcutta is like walking down a buffet line, writes Christine Kaaloa on her food blog, Grrltraveller. The entry reads: This city is phenomenal when it comes to street food. Some hawkers practically work and sleep in their stalls. Each morning, they wake up and prepare food, hot, spicy and savoury for the hungry passers-by.Calcutta has close to 2,00,000 street food vendors serving over 10 million people daily with over 250 varieties of dishes  soft-boiled duck egg sandwich, uttapam, malai kofta and dal butter fry with masala kulcha or missi roti, dudh puli, sarpuria, whatever not.A recent survey conducted by travel portal booking.com has declared Calcutta the top street food hub of India, ahead of Amritsar, Delhi, Ahmedabad and even Mumbai.Serenaded by honking cars and buses amid smoke and dust, these vendors have been carrying on for decades. Profits are minimal, but sales volumes keep them going.Indira Chakravarty, a public health expert, whose studies on the citys food vendors have led to policy changes at various levels, tries to get street food vendors to cater whenever she organises seminars and conferences.Her reason: street food is safer because vendors rarely store food. As a consultant with the Food Safety and Standards Authority, she has seen how a lot of hotels store meat, poultry and non-vegetarian items for as long as six months. A street vendor prepares food in the morning and by evening everything is sold out, says Chakravarty, who is now chief adviser of West Bengals public health engineering department. As if to underline her point, she orders toast, omelette and peyanji  an onion pakoda variant  from a vendor near her office in Dalhousie Square.Chakravarty has conducted surveys of Calcuttas street food on behalf of the All India Institute of Health and Public Hygiene (AIIHPH), whose results have been feted by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization. The verdict: The spread is tasty and highly affordable. At the time of the survey, in 1995, hygiene standards needed improving.That has changed, Chakravarty says. Our members try to maintain standards and learn the basics of food safety, says Anadi Saha, general secretary of the Hawker Mens Union and Hawker Sangram Committee. He adds, We have had workshops organised by AIIHPH experts.Though much has been done, much remains to be achieved. Vendors dont have a clear idea about harmful artificial colours  like the carcinogenic metanil yellow used in jalebis  or spurious food additives. Neither do they know that deep frying in the same oil is bad for health. But the biggest bugbear seems to be the lurking extortionists with their continuing threats of ousting vendors.We are trying to fix all these, says Saha, who is looking forward to the civic bodys suggestion of setting up smart food kiosks. Vendors have also been promised ID cards and medical insurance coverage.THE FOOD WALK*8.30am  Madan StreetOn the footpath adjoining the Hindustan Building of the Life Insurance Corporation of India, brothers Barun and Bholanath Den have just set up their breakfast stall. Sitting atop an earthen stove is a frying pan, which exchanges place occasionally with a wire mesh laden with thick slices of bread. The frying pan is for the eggs. Most office-goers demand two slices of bread with a boiled duck egg cut in half and sprinkled with salt and pepper. Those with more time on their hands often opt for a half boiled egg, cut open and smeared on the bread and covered with a drizzle of finely chopped onions.Our father set up the stall in 1978 when this was a small market for radio, transistors and their spare parts, says Barun as he shells a hens egg with the end of a teaspoon. His dexterity and speed is such that the shell comes off as a continuum. A massive flood had destroyed our village, Amta, 50 kilometres west of Calcutta, says Bholanath as he passes a piece of toast to his son, who then slathers on it much butter and sprinkles sugar.Insurance agent Chandan Bhowmick says, I leave home at 7.30am. Theres no time for anything. I eat breakfast here and wash it all down with a bhaanr of tea. The eggs and toast cost Rs 20 and the tea, Rs 5.The Den brothers feed about 700 people every day till 8pm from Monday to Saturday. By evening everything is sold out, says Barun. Nowadays we are getting orders for office picnics and from film production units, he adds proudly.E. Chandran Swami's south Indian food stall Prasun Chaudhuri*9.30am  Crossing of Princep Street and Ganesh Chandra AvenueE. Chandran Swami has been selling south Indian food at his kiosk here since 1968. I came in 1961 from Kilalkulam near Madurai. I was 14, he reminisces as he pours batter with one swift circular motion on a square tawa. He didnt learn to make idli, dosa and uttapam in Tamil Nadu. He learnt it all at a south Indian joint here. Seven years later, he set up his shop. Today, at 70, he is helped by his grandsons.Sanjoy Roy wolfs down a masala dosa (it costs Rs 50). He is a clerk employed with a private firm that deals in automobile parts. You must try his special tomato-onion uttapam, he tells us while dipping pieces of dosa in crimson chutney. You wont find this special chilli-garlic chutney anywhere in Calcutta.Chandran cooks all the food early in the morning at his rented house near New Market with the help of his wife, daughter and grandsons. He arrives at the kiosk sharp at 9am on a cycle van. He takes special care to store the coconut chutney and other perishables in ice boxes during peak summer. The cheapest item at his kiosk is a single dahi vada, which comes for Rs 17. The most expensive item on his menu is mixed cheese butter uttapam  it costs Rs 65. Of late, hes been getting a lot of contracts from school canteens.Every day, at 6pm he shuts shop, purchases a Tamil newspaper and heads for the Maidan. There, lying on the soft grass, he reads leisurely the days news. It is a stale serving this, but thats how he likes it.Rajneesh Walias foodstall Mission Dhaba Prasun Chaudhuri*2pm  Ganesh Avenue and Mangoe Lane crossingWhen we reach Rajneesh Walias foodstall Mission Dhaba, there is already a large crowd around the tandoor. About 40 people, including several cab drivers, are milling around. The plates in their hands are laden with dal makhani, chana, paneer, kulcha and pulao.Gopal Das, who drives a yellow taxi, says he lunches here at least four times a week. My order seldom changes, he says. I take half plates of chana masala, dal makhani and raita, alongside two tandoori rotis. All of it comes to Rs 60. We take a cue and place the same order. The dal makhani has a lovely smoky taste. The masala kulcha is as soft as a pillow. And the Rs 14-a-plate raita has pineapple and pomegranate in it.Rajneesh cooks the food with a couple of assistants at a small shop on Mangoe Lane. He says, My father, Surjit Singh Walia, started this 20 years ago. But this half-plate variety is my innovation.Rajneesh has started getting orders to cater for weddings and private parties. No advertising and all, he says matter-of-factly. Its mostly word-of-mouth.Bablu Kanta Ghosh has been selling Bengali sweets on the pavement near the India Coffee House for nearly 50 years now Prasun Chaudhuri*4pm  Meredith Street and Central Avenue crossingAfter a heavy lunch, its time to wrap up with some desserts. Bablu Kanta Ghosh has been selling Bengali sweets on the pavement near the India Coffee House for nearly 50 years now. I learnt my craft at a sweetmeat shop in Howrah, says Bablu. He himself hails from Haripur village in Hooghly district, 35 kilometres north of Calcutta.From Monday to Saturday, he stays at Bowbazars Chhana Patty, the hub of cottage cheese. Chhana is the basic ingredient of most Bengali sweets. Bablu prepares sweets that are not easily available at sweetmeat shops  malpua, labanga latika, bel morabba and darbesh.The bel morabba is a big hit with those who have problems with their morning constitutional.I make these myself and bring it all here in a hand-pulled cart, says Bablu. He also sells rasogolla, chhana pora, lyangcha, rasomalai and a variety of sandesh sourced from Hooghly. Sweets from Hooghly are far better than those you get in the city, he says.

In colonial times, only the French were allowed to take part in the dance accompanied with music. After the French left, the Creoles and Topazes did not allow the festival to be forgotten. And later the Tamils began to nurture it.The origin of the masquerade, which simply means ""an attempt to deceive people about the true nature or identity of something"", dates to the New Testament of the Bible and to the betrayal of Judas. It is believed that when the chief priests and the elders met in the palace of Caiaphas to plot the arrest of Jesus their problem was how to identify Jesus. It was Judas Iscariot, one of the 12 disciples of Jesus, who volunteered to help them. Today, the followers of Jesus put on different masks so that ""no henchman of the priests who take up arms against the ideals of Jesus would ever be able to identify them"". The wearers of masks parade themselves on the streets, symbolically braving Judas Iscariots.The masquerade, simply meaning ""putting on a mask and dancing"", also has a psychological undertone as well. It is born of the human feeling that one is safe in hiding. The speciality of this dance is that no two participants wear the same sort of masks which symbolizes that every individual has a distinct identity.In Puducherry, the masks are not just of men and women. It is like a fancy dress party where tigers, lions and dogs jostle with tomatoes, potatoes and brinjals in a merry procession. Some also go for body paint. The procession moves in step with synchronized beats of drums, pipes and timbrels giving the town a feel of a carnival. In spite of the motley group, there is a sense of celebration of the diverse community of Puducherry.(The author is a retired professor of English)"

Otherwise, not only do you lose on nutrition but there are also chances the food may turn toxic, leading to several disorders and illnesses. Lets take a closer look at the cookware used in Indian kitchens.Chopping boardMost people use a plastic one but the problem with plastic boards, even branded ones, is that chopping creates grooves that can harbour harmful microbes such as E. coli and salmonella. These germs get into cooked food via the next lot of sliced vegetables. Contamination is even more likely if the same board is used to chop meat or chicken. Worse, these bugs are so stubborn that even cooking may not kill them. Switch to wooden or rubber chopping boards and replace them every year.Aluminium utensilsBecause these vessels are oxidised, there is little chance of the aluminium leaching into food. Aluminium wrap, on the other hand, can leach metal if the food stays in it too long, especially if the dish has tomato, lemon juice or vinegar. A study in the Journal of Alzheimers Disease reported cases in which leached aluminium had led to Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases at a relatively young age. The US-based Agency for Toxic Substances and Diseases Registry (ATSDR) features aluminium prominently on its list of 200 toxic items. Switch to packing food in parchment paper. Wax-coated parchment paper is as effective as aluminium foil.Non-stick cookwareThese are extremely useful as they aid low-fat cooking and are easy to clean. The non-stick coating debuted as Teflon, which was later followed by several clones. In recent times, some of these new materials have been found to be associated with a host of diseases such as dyslexia and infertility. Improper use of these utensils compounds the problem. For instance, cooking over high heat or damaged coating can make these pans unsafe. You should use non-stick pans with great care or sparingly.Stainless steel vesselsQuality stainless steel looks good and there is barely any leaching. What there is  iron, manganese or chromium  can actually take care of possible mineral deficiencies. However, one ingredient is harmful  nickel. Dont scratch the utensil with scrubbing aids such as steelwool. A scarred surface would leach nickel.Iron woksTo me, iron pans may look ugly and, sometimes, the food you cook in it becomes black, especially if you cook sour items. But even if iron does get leached into food, its good for those who have anaemia. However, if any family member suffers from blood disorders such as polycythaemia and thalassaemia, iron in food can be harmful.PlasticwareHot food in a plastic container can get contaminated with the material, leading to heart diseases, infertility, some brain ailments and even cancer. A recent Harvard research also showed that BPA  found in certain types of plastics, especially that used to make water bottles  plays a key role in weight gain. Melamine is not as bad as plastic but it too gives off toxic substances when it comes in touch with steaming hot food. Do not use melamine containers to heat food in a microwave (even if labelled for use in microwaves).CeramicwareThis is perhaps the best cookware material. It can withstand high heat and be used in an oven, a microwave and even broiler. It is also good looking.Bone china and porcelainThese products are light and pleasing to the eyes. They can be used to heat food in the oven but are best used to serve food in. However, some porcelainware is embellished with gold or silver. Such pieces cannot be used in the microwave. The only problem: chinaware is fragile and needs careful handling.Earthenware and stonewareIn olden times, rice was cooked in earthenware. But earthenware as well as stoneware are liable to crack with sudden changes in temperature. Some people use stoneware crockery. However, you cannot use earthenware or stoneware in microwave ovens."

But even as they speak, memories of the times he spent at GM long ago come flooding back to him. Lata, meanwhile, tries to solve the blown-fuse problem before heading off to soothe Molly, whose meticulously laid plans are on the verge of unravelling.On the days that his mother worked late, Josh Sen, custodian of the plum-headed parakeets Optimus Prime and Max, would convince his dad, distinguished professor of something very important but difficult to remember, to drive by the Kharkai and Subarnarekha rivers. Not that Vikramjit needed much convincing. He loved the Marine Drive (though he would have preferred a different name, one which did not invariably occasion the patronising Oh yes, the other Marine Drive nod-and-head-bob from Bombaywallahs).Sometimes they would chat  updates about ones birds or the others students were exchanged  but, mostly, Josh would roll down the window (something his mother never allowed since the breeze interfered with her hair), stick his head out, and let the wind slap noisily against his cheeks. His father, who had grown up with dogs, delighted in his sons canine behaviour, folded up the sleeves of his Brooks Brothers shirts, and sang along to the radio. Eventually, they ended up at Brubeck, back in the city, and gorged on cakes. Tilo monitored Joshs refined sugar intake during the week strictly, but father and son had perfected the art of operating on a strict what-Tilo-doesnt-know-cant-hurt-Tilo principle.Should we check in on Pixie and her folks? Vik asked Josh that evening, after they had completed their usual run and turned towards the city again.Josh took his time to reply. He could be reflective after his drawing class.Before or after we order the cake? Josh asked finally.If we go before, we could take some cakes for them. If we go after, we could bring Pixie with us to Brubeck. And order the cake then. It all depends on how hungry you are now.Not hungry. Miss gave us lots of cookies, Josh replied. His drawing teacher was a flaky young Parsi artist who lived in one of those beautiful rambling colonial buildings and seemed to survive only on cookies and milk, which she set out before her students as she randomly showed them great works of art projected on the living room wall. The kids adored Miss Daruwalla.Dont mention the cookies to Ma though. She might give Miss...A lecture. I know. What happened to your healthy snack, by the way?Josh rummaged in his bag and extracted a little tiffin-box, in posh blue chrome, and presented to his father. Vik, who had his own chrome blue box in his bag somewhere, quickly wolfed down the cold quinoa cutlet with its side of home-made tomato relish. He could not stand quinoa and the coldness settled like an icy chrome-blue feeling in his stomach, with angry red lashings curling around it, like memories of the tomato relish. Lets go over to their guest house then and see how Pixie is settling in?Josh handed his father his water bottle, also chrome blue.Is Pixie going to be invited to my birthday? Josh sounded neutral enough.I am sure, Vik replied, allowing the water to unglue himself from that feeling, handing the bottle back to his son and starting the car. In fact, Tilo has probably already invited them. Why?She will go on and on about London. And my friends will find her lame.Now now, Vik said, accelerating the car.And then we went St James Park, and then we had tea with the Queen, Josh mimicked Pixies accent, in an accurate if cruel fashion. Maybe shell expect an Enid Blyton kind of high tea? With meringues and potted meat and ham and sardines and jam tarts.Vik narrowed his eyes and looked at his son.Josh Sen, is that what you want?Whaatt? Josh said innocently.***Several well-appointed flats, airy and central, had been turned by the company into a group of serviced apartments, which offered greater privacy to long-term residents than the old-fashioned guesthouses. A centralised hospitality desk offered luxuries such as room service and turn down (which, since shed had to pick up after everyone in London, felt like an unbelievable luxury to Nisha) and the kitchen provided food which, while not exciting, was adequate.One such apartment, off Kadma, was currently occupied by the Das Biswas-es, and its living room, with white walls, regulation sofas and severe landscapes, was currently caught in a terrific squall. Nisha was firm. The polka-dotted puppy who had been found under the mango tree must be returned to that spot. She had a toddler; she was not going to get another creature to look after; she was already at the verge of a nervous breakdown.But I am going to look after him myself, Mama, I promise, I promise, Pixie wailed. And Lisa Didi can help me. Lisa was the nanny. She lurked in the doorway and followed the war. She had fed some milk to the puppy and was on his side.Lisa Didi has her hands full. So do I. We will go back and return the puppy. I cant believe you smuggled him in when we expressly told you not to!Nishas face was thunderous. Bappa hovered around the flat  unable to take a stand  and had now decided to escape inside and call up admin to find out about the serviced apartments policy on pets.Pixie, equally firm, announced that if the puppy was going back to the mango tree, so was she. Lisa Didi, pack my bag, Pixie called out.Nisha couldnt decide what she should be madder about. The damn dog. Or her daughter ordering about Lisa so blithely.Pixie, Nisha began ominously when there were footsteps outside and the bell rang.Bappa reappeared, phone glued to his ears, and breathed a sigh of relief after he opened the door.Vikramjitda, welcome, welcome. We have a bit of a situation here. In fact, you can help! Come in please. Hello, Josh.The puppy, meanwhile, had hopped off Pixies lap and wandered towards the door.Woofwoof, he said to Josh.Woofwoof, replied Josh in return.Pixie snatched him up.I didnt know you had a dog, Josh said, as he came and sat next to her.She doesnt, Nisha said coldly. That dogs going.She forced herself to smile at Vik. Tea? Coffee? No Tilo?Having gauged the situation, Vik decided that it was better he sat. The puppy cast its soulful eyes on him. I wouldnt mind some tea, he said, But only if its no trouble. Tilo is working late today. We were going to Brubeck and thought wed take Pixie along if thats okay.Tea is no trouble, Nisha replied and made her way to the kitchen.Whats his name? Josh whispered, conspiratorially.Scone, Pixie whispered back.What? Josh narrowed his eyes exactly like his father.S-C-O-N-E, spelt out Pixie, now no longer whispering, Its pronounced scon, like don, not scone like cone.Josh digested this.Meanwhile, Scone Das Biswas had laid his little puppy head on Joshs knee. Despite his dislike for Pixie gathering up again, into a pulsating ball of annoyance, Josh couldnt help but fall a little in love with the polka-dotted creature, who wasnt a patch on his birds of course, but was, nonetheless, a delightful thing to love. He stroked his velvety ears gently. And that Pixie did not say anything to that. Instead, she looked beseechingly at her father and his friend. Soon, fat tears rolled down her cheeks one by one.***It was around 11.30 that Nisha returned to their bedroom. She was freshly showered. Though shed dried her hair, a few curls were still damp and clung to her cheeks. Postos asleep, she said and sat at the dressing table, applying cream on her cheeks.Nisha smiled at Bappa in the mirror and a load lifted off his chest.So is your daughter and that Scone. He is ensconced  or should we say en-scone-d now?  in her bed. Lisa is sitting there looking at him adoringly. I hope she still pays attention to Posto!Nisha got under the duvet and folded her body against her husbands.So your friend Vikramjit is quite the convincer. Should have gone into law!He was a famous debater baba, Bappa replied, taking her hand in his, leaning in to her. Long day, today, he said.Nishas hair smelt all coconut-y and familiar. Bappa felt himself descend into the sort of semi-comfortable space that might just develop an edge and lead to some (long, overdue) action.How much do you think professors earn at that B-school? Nisha asked him.Sorry, what? Bappa said, a little surprised at this new turn.Vikramjit and Tilottama  how much do you think they earn?Hmm, said Bappa, considering the matter.To be continued"

This will impact vegetable production after the next two-three months. The tomato prices may rise to Rs 80/kg in April next year, he said.Vilas Shinde, managing director at Sahyadri Farmers Producer Company Ltd, said, Vegetable plantations have already dipped in vegetable growing regions. Our sources in nurseries, which provide vegetable plants to farmers for planting, are reporting a 50% dip in their October orders.He said the area from Nashik to Marathwada , including Aurangabad and Jalna, may see a dip in vegetable plantation mainly, the effect of which might will become apparent as early as December. A 30% dip in vegetable produce is expected in the near future as vegetable planting has already begun dipping. Some effect on vegetable production in eastern Pune might also be seen, in locations like Indapur, Baramati and Solapur , Shinde added.Gadhave said places that do not have canal irrigation facilities were witnessing a dipping water table in October, a phenomenon which usually occurs in January. Farmers may, therefore, refrain from sowing vegetables, he said.He said most areas in the state recorded less rainfall this monsoon. It is due to this reason that Western Maharashtra, where a bulk of vegetables are grown, may also see a dip in production. No impact on potatoes, however, is expected as most of its production will happen before January 2019, he said.A state horticulture department official said the state government has declared a drought-like situation in 128 talukas, reporting trigger 2 conditions. A bulk of vegetables in the state is produced in regions with canal irrigation. However, the regions where this form of irrigation is not available may see an impact of the water scarcity , a situation which may worsen in January and February, he said.Another state horticulture department said the water situation is not that severe in major vegetable producing regions, such as Pune, Satara, Kolhapur , Sangli, Sangamner, Nashik, west Ahmednagar, which fall on the west side of the state, as the dams are full in the Western Ghat region."

However, market research department at the Tamil Nadu Agriculture University (TNAU) said tomato prices were likely to improve after the onset of northeast monsoon.A price advisory from the university attributed the drop in the prices to steady arrival of tomato to local markets from Karnataka. Once the monsoon sets in, transport of the crop from the neighbouring state might get hit and as a result tomato prices might go up in the state.Tomato is being sold at Rs 19-Rs 23 per kg in retail stores and markets, while the farm gate price is around Rs 11-Rs 13 per kg. However, maintaining and harvesting the crop is labour intensive and heavy rain had led to some spoilage, Veerappa, a farmer from Thondamuthur, said. We need at least 15 per kg to sustain ourselves.The major tomato producing districts in the state are Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri, Salem, Tiruppur, Theni and Dindigal."

Food Processing Industries Federation president P. Bhaskar Rao said Chittoor had been the leading producer of tomato in the State and had a substantial share in the national market.But, since it is a perishable commodity and the farmers and also entrepreneurs are struggling to earn minimum returns from it, the Union government has stepped in to alleviate their plight. The ODOP scheme is applicable for processing industries in food parks established by both the Central and the State governments.Tremendous scopeLike all other agriculture and horticulture crops, only about 5% of tomato is processed, which provides a tremendous scope for venturing into the business of adding value to it.Food parksMr. Rao pointed out that the Andhra Pradesh government was promoting 12 food parks with its own budget in addition to the Central government-sponsored Srini Food Park in Chittoor and Mallavalli Mega Food Park in Krishna district and the one dedicated for aquaculture namely the Godavari Mega Aqua Food Park at Bhimavaram in West Godavari district.Processing unitsIn all, 20 to 25 food parks had been sanctioned by the Centre across the country, but the State had taken the task of promoting the processing units upon itself by setting up its own parks in view of the great importance of the rich variety of crops to its economy and the livelihood of lakhs of farmers."

5ce7a0eee8e3fc56af41a735,A Star Is Born is big-feeling cinema,https://www.telegraphindia.com/entertainment/a-star-is-born-is-big-feeling-cinema/cid/1672675,2018-10-26,,Telegraph,"A Star Is Born is such a great Hollywood myth that its no wonder Hollywood keeps telling it. Whatever the era, the director or the headliners, it relates the story of two lovers on dramatically differing paths: a famous man whos furiously racing to the bottom (Bradley Cooper in this movie) and a woman (Lady Gaga) whos soaring to the top. This latest and fourth version is a gorgeous heartbreaker (bring tissues). Like its finest antecedents, it wrings tears from its romance and thrills from a steadfast belief in old-fashioned, big-feeling cinema. That its also a perverse fantasy about men, women, love and sacrifice makes it all the better.Like the last iteration, the epically (empirically!) terrible 1976 remake with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, the new one takes place in a contemporary music world that is by turns exciting, suffocating and crowded with dangers  ravenous fans, crushing performance demands, celebrity itself. This is the world that has helped create and come close to ruining Jackson Maine (Cooper), a country-rock musician who, when the movie opens, is performing obviously wasted, leaning and nearly falling into a boot-stomping song. Hes a beautiful ruin adrift on an ocean of booze, one he routinely spikes with pills.A singer with a voice that can thunder, Ally Campana (Lady Gaga) becomes Jacks safe harbour, taking on the roles of lover, partner, muse, ideal. Thats a heavy burden, but Ally is one of lifes chin-up survivors, with an errant mother and a loving, larger-than-life father, Lorenzo (a terrific Andrew Dice Clay), whose dreams cloud her own. Dad runs a limo business out of their Los Angeles home, where his male colleagues (Barry Shabaka Henley, among others) and their boisterous camaraderie fill the rooms, both warming and crowding them. Ally is accustomed to navigating around men larger than she is, elbowing past them to be seen and heard.She and Jack first meet late one night in a Hollywood drag club where she sings after her waitress shift ends. Jack has just finished playing a concert and, after polishing off a bottle of booze, has stumbled into the club for more. There he watches Ally belt out the Edith Piaf standard La Vie en Rose, in a sheath and upsweep, her arched artificial brows adding quizzical punctuation to her face. In a swoon, he invites her out that night, and, as flirtation gives way to deeper feelings, they fall in love. He brings Ally onstage and then on tour, but she eventually goes solo, becoming a star whose ascent is shadowed by his decline.Cooper, who also directed, does a lot right in this take on A Star Is Born, beginning with the casting of Lady Gaga, whose disarming, naturalistic presence is crucial to the movies force. A post-Madonna pop artiste known for her elaborate stagecraft and costumes, she has been stripped down here, her mask removed. You can see her skin, the flutter in her veins, which brings you close to her, and can make both the actress and her character feel touchingly vulnerable. This unmasking of Lady Gaga also makes Ally seem genuine, authentic, a quality that the movie champions and that serves as a kind of thematic first principle.Soon after Jack and Ally meet, he peels off one of her fake brows  hes flirting, but hes also saying that he sees the real her and wants the world to as well. Playful yet unapologetically earnest, this scene inaugurates a seduction  of Ally, of us  that lasts the exhilarating first hour. Cooper understands the power of big-screen myths, including thunderstruck love and near-magical lucky breaks. He also understands his own star appeal (he gives himself plenty of heat-stoking close-ups), which dovetails with his role as director. When Ally and Jack look at each other, youre watching two people fall in love, and its a contact high. Youre also watching a director guiding  creating  his star as life seeps into fiction.Coopers smartest decision, other than casting Lady Gaga, is the absolute sincerity with which hes taken on this material, in all its gorgeous, gaudy excess. He has refurbished the story some and added a bit too much psychological filler, but he has stayed true to its fundamental seriousness. Winking at this story would have been easy, but would have destroyed it. Instead, working from a script he wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, Cooper has gone all in with big emotions and cascades of tears. (The movie owes a debt to, and nods at, the original 1937 film as well as the 1954 remake with a peerless Judy Garland.)Part of whats exciting about this A Star Is Born is that Cooper knows hes telling one of the defining Hollywood stories and has given the movie the polish and scale it merits. He plays with intimacy and cinematic sweep, going in close when Ally and Jack are together so that the world falls away  a scene of them in a parking lot shows how conversation turns to courtship  only to then pull back so we can see the enormity of the world the lovers inhabit once Jack takes Ally on tour. And while the crowd seems little more than a surging blur the first time Jack plays, when Ally looks at the throng, she sees it and so do we.The concert scenes of Jack and Ally performing are revved up but personal. (The production borrowed crowds from actual music festivals like Coachella, and their sheer size conveys the scope of Jacks stardom.) Cooper sings pleasantly enough and throttles an electric guitar with persuasive fervour. Hes backed by the group Lukas Nelson & the Promise of the Real (Lukass dad is Willie Nelson). The music mixes standards with new songs, some written by Cooper, Lukas Nelson and Lady Gaga, whose supple, often electric singing can, at full throttle, express intensities of feeling far better than the dialogue.Like many filmmakers, Cooper sometimes explains too much. It isnt enough that Jack drinks; Cooper wants us to know why. So, he fleshes out Jacks past, turning melodrama into therapy and robbing the character of mystery. One of the weakest scenes, a violent confrontation between Jack and his much-older brother, Bobby (Sam Elliott, whose deep drawl Cooper has borrowed), is an information dump. In one of the finest, Bobby just wordlessly drives away from Jack, and Elliott lets you see the ferocity of the brothers love - and their pain - in eyes that have begun to water and in a stone face that will shatter.Cooper spends more time on the storys male lead than previous iterations have, perhaps because hes taken the role himself. The focus on Jack  he scrapes bottom, goes into recovery  somewhat weighs down the remainder of the movie, partly because too much of it is overly familiar. At times, Cooper seems to share Jacks unease with Allys stardom, particularly after she connects with a manager (Rafi Gavron, oozing sleaze) and transforms from a soulful crooner into a writhing automaton with soulless beats and backup singers. Ally puts on the mask that Cooper has removed from Lady Gaga, suggesting that  unlike Jacks  her art is less than pure.Male self-aggrandisement is baked into the storys foundation but not ruinously. Jack doesnt just help turn Ally into a star, giving her the big break she needs. His trauma  shes insecure, but hes damaged  becomes a deep well that she draws from, allowing her to become a greater artist. In part, the story is as creaky as that of Pygmalion, the male sculptor who turns a beloved carving into a woman. Yet one of the pleasures of A Star Is Born in all its renditions is that it is also about a woman whose ambitions are equal to those of any man and who steadily rises as she weeps and sings toward fabulous self and sovereignty."

We are already No.1 in the country in papaya, mango, banana and chilli crops and will soon become a horticultural hub, he said.Recalling the upheaval among farmers due to the glut and the resultant lack of remunerative prices for mango, turmeric, chilli, jowar and maize in the last few years, he emphasised on looking beyond the traditional farming practices and embrace new technologies both to cut down cost and overcome the vagaries of monsoon.The amount spent towards market intervention fund by this government in the last four years is Rs. 3,800 crore against the paltry Rs. 340 crore spent by the previous government during 2009-14 for the combined State, he pointed out.Dig at CentreThe State government did go the extra mile by increasing the quantum of support during disasters, he said and flayed the Centre for remaining nonchalant.

The company, which already has brands like Sugar Free and Nutralite, the addition of Complan and Glucon-D, is expected to strengthen its equity in the consumer wellness segment. Further, its range of skincare products under Everyuth is also expected to be complimented with the inclusion of Nycil.Apart from the four brands, ZWL will also get two large manufacturing facilities in Aligarh and Sitarganj and teams devoted to operations, research, sales, marketing and support. Heinz India has a strong distribution network of over 800 distributors, more than 20,000 wholesalers covering 29 states.Among these brands, Heinz India recorded revenues of about Rs 1,150 crore for the 12 month period ended June 30. Following this acquisition, Zydus Wellness will have consolidated revenues of about Rs 1,700 crore.This development offers immense opportunity to broaden our portfolio and invest in brands and products that we believe are most relevant to health conscious consumers. This acquisition will be an ideal addition to Zydus Wellness, supporting our aspirations to grow in the consumer wellness space by providing multiple choices to consumers, Sharvil Patel, chairman, Zydus Wellness, said while commenting on the deal."

Nineteen schools in Kozhikode are also part of Sanjeevani.Organic seedsAs part of the programme, differently abled children will sow organic seeds and nurture them. The project had begun as initiatives of the district missions in Malappuram and Thiruvananthapuram and is now being expanded Statewide.In Malappuram, the project began as Thalir in 15 schools in August last year. This year, it has been scaled up to cover seven more schools. Growbags, compost, and seeds are given to the Buds schools for children to cultivate.The children plant seeds of ladys finger, tomato, brinjal, long beans, chilli, and other seeds; water them; remove weeds; and harvest the produce with the support of their teachers, parents, and Kudumbashrees joint liability groups.The project was inspired by the tapioca yield in a few schools. It was then decided to start organic cultivation of other crops as an activity for the children to keep them active, and bring them close to nature, Mr. Haskar says.At the Cherukavu Buds school, the Kudumbashree has introduced a form of drip irrigation using PVC pipes that ensures that all the plants are watered using less water and the children are not taxed much either. This year, at Kondotty, they are growing plants in 40 growbags on garden stands besides on a plot of land.Mr. Haskar says vegetable cultivation is an activity that could be done even at home once the children get a hang of it. Completing various jobs such as watering plants or removing weeds helps develop their concentration. It could even evolve into a source of livelihood for them in future.Besides growbag cultivation in Alappuzha, Idukki and Kozhikode, farming is being done by children in two cents or more of land near the Buds schools. In total, 345 cents of land is under vegetable farming.The maximum area under cultivation is in Kollam-68 cents, Mr. Haskar says. Thrissur followes with 64 cents, while Malappuram has 50 cents."

On the sidelines of the launch of the new season of her audio chat show #NoFilterNeha on Saavn, t2 chatted with the actress about cravings, maternity leave and the #MeToo movement.What an incredible year youre having, both professionally and personally. Hows the pregnancy treating you?Very well, in fact. I always wondered, What will I do when I get pregnant? and now that I am pregnant, I am doing exactly what Ive been doing throughout  I am working, I am exercising and socialising. Every pregnancy is different. If there are women who want to stay home through their pregnancy, I respect that. If there are women who want to go out there and work, Id tell them to get up and do it.Everyone whos pregnant has talked about weird cravings. Have you had any?Yes. In my first trimester, I was doing Roadies. I was living in a tent and Id be craving raw tomatoes with lime and salt. In my second trimester, I only wanted bhindi and roti, and this is my third trimester and I want to each chicken and rice all the time. I am talking to you but all I can think of is when Ill get to eat chicken and rice! (Laughs) The only things I have had to give up are eggs and chocolate.Between your husband Angad Bedi and you, whos reading all the baby books?Neither of us. We will be the kind of parents who will take each day as it comes. We dont have a single parenting book or have enrolled for any classes. I am in my eighth month and my doctor has told me to continue doing what I am doing. The idea is not to change my daily routine too much. My mom keeps telling me, If you are strong enough to give life, then get up and do the work you want to do.Have you been getting a ton of advice from people?Yeah and its very boring and I dont want it. Please dont give me advice. People are constantly trying to tell me if I am having a boy or a girl. I am told if my stomach is a certain shape, it means its a boy or a girl. And really, I am not interested.This is the third season of your show and you have Angad as a guest. What was it like to interview your husband?Thats a big one for me. It made me nervous. In the previous years, interviewing Karan (Johar) always made me nervous because he is a talk show host but this year, talking to Angad was nerve-wracking. When you are talking to your husband, you dont know where to draw the line and thats exactly what happened when we were recording. We ended up talking for two hours!Youve always talked about Shah Rukh Khan being a dream guest. Would he be on the show this year?Unfortunately not! We were in conversation but hes not doing interviews right now, so I guess next time.Over the three seasons, apart from Karan Johar, whos been your favourite guest and why?Every year theres one guest who surprises me. My biggest surprise this year has been Harbhajan Singh because hes literally done a lot of spin bowling in the comments that he made. And then last year, it was Rishi Kapoor who I was very fascinated with. Apart from Karan, the one guest who cracked me up the most was Farah Khan.You do audio, youre on television, you also act in films  is there a medium that has your heart?This ones very, very close because I am a producer and the host. Donning many different hats makes me feel like I have achieved a lot at the end of one season. But nothing gives me as much satisfaction as making a film. I have Helicopter Eela thats released recently and which I am very excited about.We (Neha and husband Angad Bedi) will be the kind of parents who will take each day as it comes. We dont have a single parenting book or have enrolled for any classes (Agencies)Are you are planning a maternity break after this?Errrr I dont know. I am hoping to keep working until the last day. And then I bring a new life into this world and then get back to work as soon as I can. Again, I dont think there is any such thing as a bad parent; one that gets back to work is just as amazing as the one who stays at home to nurture. I dont know which one of these Id be.Keira Knightley recently wrote an essay about pregnancy and the pressures that society puts on women to look perfect immediately after birth. In the past there has been a lot of scrutiny on Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Kareena Kapoor Khan regarding their post-baby bodiesShame on people who fat-shame new mothers. The most important thing for me is that I am feeling healthy. Will I get disturbed with peoples opinion on my body after I deliver my child? I dont know.There is always pressure on us in the public eye. But I also know that the first couple of months after a woman gives birth, her life is turned upside down. You feel like a wreck and if you look like one, its totally okay. This is the most beautiful time in a mothers life and how you look or dont should be the least of your worries. I hope that I can remind myself this every day. And if I forget, then my mother or husband remind me because their opinion matters the most in my life.Is Bollywoods #MeToo movement a long time coming?Of course. We need to clean up the industry. It makes me very angry that people are questioning the women who are coming forward. At the same time, I am very happy that women are talking. It takes a lot of courage. You cannot turn a blind eye when someone comes forward. When someone shares their story, you have to support them, no matter what. Whether I bring  a daughter or a son  into this world, Id want to teach them these right values."
