Palanisamy said that the Government should immediately process the applications of those farmers who had applied for free power connection and process within three months the applications of those farmers who would be applying for power connection in the coming days.He sought repair and maintenance of the shutters at Parambikulam Reservoir that would help release of water to Thoonakadavu. He also sought the construction of a canal from River Bhavani to fill tanks and water bodies so as to help farmers take up cultivation on over 50,000 acre.Eswaran, a farmer of Chokkanur, urged the State Government to subsidise natural pest repellents that would help farmers fight the white fly menace. He said coconut, guava, sapota, tomato and vegetable crops were damaged due to the fly. The natural pest repellents were available in the market at Rs. 500  600 a litre, which was exorbitant for the farmers.Periasamy, a farmer from Theethipalayam, sought an end of boars destroying crops.The farmers then handed over a cheque for Rs. 10,000 to the district administration to be used in relief operation in cyclone-affected districts."

Farmers also agreed that innovation is the key to the next level of reforms in production and income. The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Ropar, has put up on display many products, one of which was 'Smart integrated irrigation and energy management system'.Talking about this innovative system, Dr Vikrant Bhakar, from IIT Ropar, said, ""This product helps convert extra power from solar to AC through an inverter and the farmer can save up to 7,560 units of power per year, and earn a good amount of money, if he decides to sell this power.""The Institute has also displayed products for keeping fruits and vegetables fresh for two to three days; for peeling off peas; and Agri Marketing-App.""We are the technology partner for a project on 'Sustainable Food Supply Chain Systems and Water Management', being undertaken in collaboration with the University of Cambridge,"" Bhakar added. 'Innovation is Great' - so goes the tagline of the pavilion of the United Kingdom (UK).There are multiple companies which have brought along their innovative products in the streams of pre and post-harvest management. Nextek has developed a hydrogen-based film to increase the shelf-life of the agri-produce.Speaking of the product, Professor Edward Kosior, Managing Director, Nextek said, ""Our packaging has the capacity to reduce water loss and stop condensation, hence the life of the agri-products increases. We are undertaking this project in collaboration with India and ten companies from both the countries are engaged in research, development and testing.""Ardra Systems has displayed their soil sensors, which release water when required, saving the wastage of water. PBD Biotech has developed a revolutionary kit to identify bacteria in a cow's milk, which will work for disease prevention.Also, countries like Canada, China, Israel and Netherlands also have displayed many innovative products in grain storage management, biosystems, genetics, disease control.Khristein Water, co-founder of Sponnado, a Canada based company which has developed an air sampler says, ""these products cost Rs 16,000 and will give the farmer advance warning from one to two weeks that there is fungal infection in his crop be it potato, tomato and other crops and thus the farmer will be able to take remedial measures and spray accordingly. It will cover an area of 50 to 100 acres thus a group of farmers or village can buy this system. There is small device in this sampler which will collect the sample and that has to be send to the laboratory for testing and thus from the test one will be clear which kind of fungal infection,'' she says.Tech giant Microsoft also endeavors to make companies and farmers aware of their B2B solution which is a cloud-enabled 'Special Purpose Agri-specific Platform'.A representative of Microsoft shared that the app-based system will help the pharmaceutical companies, farm equipment companies, seed companies to gather information about the ground and weather conditions to send an advisory to the farmers about when to spray pesticides when to sow the seeds.""Research and testing is on for this product, and it will be made available globally by next year,"" he said.Pramod Rajan, Head - Research and Development, International Tractors Limited (Sonalika Group) said, ""For real ground-level adoption of technology, there needs to be a two-way communication between the business and the end-user. Just showcasing technology is never enough; it needs to be made available at the ground level."""

Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav led one such group from Bijwasan. Narmada Bachao Andolan activist Medha Patkar, All India Kisan Sabhas Hannan Mollah and others joined the protest that was held under the united banner of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee The march Thursday led to traffic snarls on 26km of city roads. We are saying sorry to people who have been troubled due to traffic snarls. We have distributed pamphlets among them to briefly explain the farmers distress, Yadav said.The pamphlets urged the people to join them when they march to the Parliament on Friday. Farmer groups also threatened to protest naked if stopped from reaching there.The pamphlets stated that farmers get only Rs 5 per kilo of tomato while consumers pay Rs 30. Our life is also cheap. In the last 20 years, over three lakh farmers have committed suicide, the pamphlet informed.The farmers said they demand the convening of the Parliament to pass two bills: one pertaining to one-time full loan waiver, the other for a long-term institutional measure to ensure farmers are not pushed into debt again. They also demand implementation of Swaminathan Commission recommendations that say the minimum support price should be fixed at 50% above the comprehensive cost of production.Yadav called the BJP government at the Centre the most anti-farmer government ever. The protest march is for the liberation of farmers from the spectre of suicides, from various forms of exploitation propagated by the state and from organised loot and plunder, he said.Anish Kumar from Delhi School of Social Work said there is a lack of political will to address the agrarian distress. We joined the protest to give strength to the voice of the farmers that has been raised at a crucial time ahead of next General Election. We want the policy-makers to listen to the voice, Kumar said.A group of students from Delhi University joined the protest march near Dhaula Kuan. The farmers claimed that in all marches students, artists, lawyers, doctors, etc, extended support.A musical evening mainly based on agrarian, rural and folk themes was organised at Ramlila Maidan where the farmers retired for the night.In Video: Delhi: Farmers gather in capital today to protest against centre"

Rajagopal was elated when his daughter R. Jayavarshini told him she was keen on pursuing farming  an avocation that ran in the family  despite having completed an engineering course. The father-daughter duo underwent training at a poly greenhouse plantation in Hosur and began cultivating crops at Rajappan Chavadi near Needamangalam.But their hopes came crashing down as Cyclone Gaja struck. She did not want to take up any other job, and I started the plantation in her name. The yield was very good and encouraging. But Cyclone Gaja turned everything upside down as our greenhouse plantations were completely destroyed, said Mr. Rajagopal, whose plantation was, notably, inaugurated by the District Collector.He had set up three units, covering 25 cents each. Each unit had cost over Rs. 9 lakh for the greenhouse and an additional Rs. 2 lakh for the installation of a drip irrigation system. The government subsidy is limited to one acre, which means the unit would get only Rs. 4.5 lakh as against the Rs. 9 lakh spent on building it.I had a structure capable of withstanding wind speeds of up to 120 km per hour. The destruction [caused by Gaja] shows that the wind speed [during the cyclone] was much higher, said S. Jeethaman Krishna, who took up agriculture after completing an MBA from the University of Wales.We are a family of agriculturists, and I opted for horticulture in Tiruvarur  the rice bowl. I established the plantation in 2013, said Mr. Krishna, who cultivated cucumber, tomato and coriander as an intercrop. He said a unit could produce 20 tonnes of vegetables and bring revenue of Rs. 15 lakh per annum.When asked whether he would be able to use his plantation again, Mr. Krishna said he would have to start from scratch, as the wind had shaken the foundation of the structure. The absence of an insurance scheme was a major problem, he added."
5ce667ece8e3fc56af4130ae,Saransh Goila is the butter chicken guy,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/food/saransh-goila-is-the-butter-chicken-guy/cid/1676491,2018-11-25,"With TV shows, a book and the famous Goila Butter Chicken in his kitty, chef Saransh Goila is one of the youngest celebrity chefs of India who is making a mark in the global culinary world. The 31-year-old guy from Delhi recently added another feather on his cap (read: chefs hat) when he appeared as a guest judge on one of the episodes of MasterChef Australia, on the popular shows 10th anniversary special season, in which the contestants had to recreate his famous butter chicken for an elimination round.In a telephonic chat with us, Saransh spoke about his MasterChef experience, future plans and a possible Goila Butter Chicken restaurant in Calcutta.You are globally known for your Goila Butter Chicken. Whats the secret that makes it different from butter chicken served elsewhere?Its actually a home recipe. I used to cook it for my parents when I was much younger. They used to always complain that as vegetarians, they got to eat a much more shoddy version of butter chicken, which is paneer butter masala. And that would always be too creamy and too sweet. When I went to my culinary school, I figured out a recipe where I would smoke it with coal and serve it to them. So basically, it would be more robust and smoky. Thats how I ended up infusing smoke into a traditional butter chicken gravy.I also reduced the amount of fat and dairy that goes into the dish  basically cream and butter  so the tartness of tomato shines out. Since we infuse smoke using coal  a more traditional technique  it makes the dish a little different. So Goila Butter Chicken is lighter, home-style and guilt-free; something that a millennial would eat. The dish is more in sync with today. Its not modern in its presentation but in its flavour profile.What is your earliest memory of having butter chicken?I am not someone who grew up eating butter chicken. The first butter chicken I ate was in my college, IHM, Aurangabad. My trainer was an ex-ITC chef and he had a very good recipe for the dish. That was my first taste of butter chicken  creamy, very refined, smooth with lots of flavours. Then when I went back to Delhi and tried the local butter chicken that people like, it was very different than what my trainer had made me try. What I realised was that people would actually savour the extra creamy, buttery and bright orange version of the recipe.Its interesting that despite being a vegetarian for most part of your life, you are known for a chicken dish. Wasnt it difficult to understand the flavours and innovate on a dish which you had never had until you were in college?When I was first put into the butchery section in college, I went with a professional approach since I didnt have any option. I didnt know how meat tastes, how its cooked. I feel cooking is a balance between passion and technique.Your personal favourite when it comes to butter chicken apart from your own?Its actually from a restaurant in Delhis Ashok Vihar called Invitation. For me, thats the best butter chicken I have ever had.How did your restaurant come about?I always thought I would open a fine-dining restaurant. I never thought I would end up opening a QSR which is centred around butter chicken! It occurred to me only after I started doing TV shows that we, as chefs, look at food as a luxury but when you travel across India you realise that its first a necessity. So this is when it came to my mind to test it out as a venture since I already had a popular recipe. So June 2016 is when I opened Goila Butter Chicken in Bombay.Whats next for Goila Butter Chicken?We are looking at expanding to different parts of the country. Right now its just Bombay but we are looking to expand to cities like Bangalore, Calcutta, Delhi and Gurgaon.You have been a contestant yourself on Food Food Maha Challenge (a reality show on Food Food) which you ended up winning too (2011). How was it like being a guest judge on a show like MasterChef Australia?Life has come full circle for me. When you find fame through a reality show, it becomes much more challenging because theres fame to deal with. Suddenly people start doubting your capability as a restaurant chef because they feel you are more of a TV person. So there has to be a balance. You have to keep honing your skills.I feel satisfied with the fact that I got an opportunity through winning a reality show. I was very, very happy that MasterChef got me on board not only because of my popularity but because of my product. That makes me feel very proud. I was just out of college when I had started watching MasterChef and I always used to dream of being on the show. And to be there as a guest judge, getting so much respect, makes you feel great.The set is beautiful, its a permanent structure that has been stationed there for 10 years. They are very professional and honest in their approach towards the show. No wonder MasterChef Australia is the most popular MasterChef franchise across the globe. Theres a soul to the show.Saransh Goila (centre) with (from left) Gary Mehigan, Matt Preston and George Calombaris on the sets of MasterChef Australia. Source: TwitterTell us some of the fun things that happened behind the scenes on the set...When I met Matt (Preston) on the set, he was talking about his trip to India. He is such a great orator that when he was talking about Hyderabadi Biryani, just the way he was describing it made me feel like having it right then and there. He is a fun person and also very particular about his costumes. I had done a pop-up at chef Georges (Calombaris) restaurant, as a part of the Melbourne Food & Wine Festival in the same month when we were filming MasterChef. He loves to party, engage with young people and promote them. I owe this opportunity to him.George is full of life, energetic. Matt is probably a romantic and an intellectual and Gary is down to earth, likeable and honest. He loves India, be it the food, spices, people he spends three months a year in India now. As an Indian, you would relate to him the most, he is very warm.Your name is in the Limca Book of Records for the longest road journey by a chef. What is your takeaway from it?If I had to break down India into different cuisines, there are so many communities, the cuisine is so diverse every 200km the flavour, food, spice blend, ingredients change. I was very fascinated with the North-east in fact  lots of fermentation, different cooking techniques. Nagaland was an amazing state to be in and experience the tribal cuisine; even Assam was interesting.In the south, I found Andhra cuisine to be quite interesting their pickles are amazing. I discovered gondhoraj lebu in Calcutta. I discovered many such ingredients and realised it would probably take a lifetime if I had to discover everything in our country.Any particular region that stood out?It would definitely be Nagaland. In fact, I did a special at my restaurant  Black Sesame Pork, which was there for three months.Globally, do you think the stereotypes about Indian food has somewhat started breaking or do they still exist?The stereotypes are definitely breaking. There are many international restaurants who are presenting India in a very different format. Be it Gaggan (Anand) in Bangkok or chef Garima (Arora) who became the first Indian woman to get a Michelin star. People have started to realise that Indian food isnt just about curry-driven gravy, its much more than that. Its balanced, theres so much history, influence of Ayurveda this is the time for Indian food to reposition itself.A TV show host, writer and a chef, which role do you like playing the most?The profile that works for me the most is that of a chef traveller. I like to travel within India and share with the world what our country has to offer. Thats something that gives me the most satisfaction.What will we see you doing next?Sadak Chef is something I am working on at the moment. The show (for a digital platform) promotes street chefs who have created amazing dishes but have never got their due. I will be travelling across the country. I am working on a couple of other shows as well; an international one too which we are doing with a big channel in Singapore. I am looking to be more global, trying and selling Indian food across the globe. Thats where I am headed with all my content and activities that I am doing in 2019.QUICK SIXChefs you look up to: I closely follow David Chang. Then theres Jamie Oliver; Anthony Bourdain was someone I used to take inspiration from. Back home theres Sanjeev Kapoor; I used to dedicatedly watch his shows. Now he is a friend and mentor. He will always be someone I look up to.An ingredient you are loving right now: Jackfruit, green garlic. But over all, its mushrooms.A dominant food trend right now: Looking within, going regional when it comes to Indian food. Just getting back the classics and presenting them in a more acceptable format. Theres so much sustainable farming happening, people are now talking about what is available in our country.Your fave cuisine: Indian. Difficult to choose which part of India though.Your earliest memory of cooking: When I made aloo paratha as a kid with the help of my uncle.Your biggest culinary influence: My grandfather. Though, while growing up, I learnt cooking from my mother, I was inspired by my grandfather because I was fascinated with him in the kitchen every Sunday cooking something for us."
5ce671a6e8e3fc56af413365,Rustom’s irresistible charm,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/rustoms-irresistible-charm/article25582500.ece,2018-11-24,"Ever saw the film  or the play  12 Angry Men? I was reminded, well, not of the story, but of the title when we sat down to dinner at Rustoms  a restaurant that serves delicious Parsi food in the Capital  a few nights ago. You could have named our table Seven Hungry Men and Women.I was just making a list of all that we ate, and felt rather embarrassed. We ordered enough for a party of 15. And we finished up almost everything on the table. But let me start at the beginning. A dear friend from Kolkata was in town  ostensibly to see how I was doing. We were meeting her after a long time, so there was much to talk about. So we  a group of seven  gathered at Rustoms.Gourmets delightRustoms has been around for a while in Delhi. I used to hear good things about it when it was at Adhchini. Somehow, I never went there, quite possibly because the traffic there could be manic. But I had been raring to visit the place ever since I heard that Rustoms had moved to the Parsi Anjuman complex on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg.So we gathered there, and ordered chhanch and homemade raspberry soda (Rs. 150 each), sev puri and dahi batata puri (both Rs. 175), Russian pattice (Rs. 295), paatra ni macchhi (Rs. 325), prawn kababs (Rs. 325), salli boti gosht (Rs. 395), chicken dansak (Rs. 175), vegetable Parsi pulao (Rs. 395), caramel custard and lagan nu custard (both Rs. 250) and Bombay kulfi (Rs. 150).I just had a taste of all the fried dishes  and they were delicious. The papri with sev came with a heap of crunchy sev over the papri which had been topped with chopped onion and tomatoes and chutney. The dahi batata puris had potatoes, onions, chutney and a delightfully spiced curd over it. The prawn kababs were again a great mix of mashed prawn and spring onion. But what I really loved was the Rusian pattice  which was a mix of creamy cheese, chicken and mashed potatoes, coated with semolina and some cheese straws and then deep fried. It was  in one word  yum!I had the fish without any guilt pangs. It was a telapiya fillet which had been steamed wrapped in banana leaf after being smeared with sweet, sour and spicy chutney prepared with mint and coriander leaves. I had it with the vegetable pulao and loved it. I am told the prawn berry pulao is a must-have there, but we had friends with a prawn allergy, so steered clear of it.The salli boti gosht  mutton with a spicy tomato gravy topped with crispy potato straws  was nice and rich. I thought the chicken dhansak was just about ok. It seemed like a normal dhansak with minced chicken balls on the side.But I loved the desserts. I thoroughly enjoyed the creamy caramel custard and lagan nu custard  baked with nuts and raisins (I could taste the chironjee). The Bombay kulfi got over before I could even look at it. The mawa cake came gratis but was avoidable, I think.Way to goSo book a table and head for Rustoms at the Parsi Anjuman or Dharamshala. This is the sprawling Parsi complex (ample parking space there) next to the Maulana Azad Medical College, on the other side of the road from all the newspaper offices (Phone: 09910060502 and 01133106353).We left after the dessert but the other five lingered over coffee. And after eating and drinking all that, they eyed the food on other peoples tables and decided that the next time they are there, they will have a thaali. The vegetable thaali (Rs. 400) has soya pattice, Parsi dal, tarkari ni curry, vengna nu achar, steamed rice, Parsi rotis and chutney. The mutton thaali is for Rs. 495 and the pomfret one for Rs. 695. We will wait for the friend from Kolkata to come for another visit, and the Seven Hungry Men and Women shall return."
5ce6728ee8e3fc56af4133ea,The Thing With Childhood Love,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/books/the-thing-with-childhood-love/cid/1676389,2018-11-24,"Recap: Shaarani Sen declines Ronnys request to play Abala Bose and Lata makes a fragile peace with Manjulika, who warns Nimki not to bring up Ronny in future. And on their way back from Ghosh Mansion, Aaduri gives Hem the lowdown on Lata and Ronny.Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, arguably the greatest exponent of relationships in literary Bengal, had written in Devdas that childhood love was, for all its intensity, ultimately cursed. It seldom led to happily ever-afters.But we are both over 18, Kakimoni, Lata had replied, softly, suddenly maudlin even though she found the possibility that what they had  that perfect, fragrant, sunset-coloured thing  might be poisoned to be highly remote. Shed buried her nose in the pink pashmina shawl she had stolen that season from Manjulikas almirah.When shed lifted her head, she saw Kakimoni smiling. Whaaat? shed said, and Kakimoni shucked her chin. That pink is perfect for people newly in love, shed laughed. You are right, it doesnt apply to those who are not children. But Kakimoni said that tartly, raising her eyes in the direction of the verandah where Ronny was bickering with Molly over the carrom board, much like a minor. Well find out, wont we? she said, Whether you were children or adults!Kakimoni would then heave herself from the bed and go out to their little kitchen, carved out of a nook where a tertiary stairway had been boarded up  the Ghoshes had all divided up their kitchens by then  in order to make them scrambled egg sandwiches with cheese. And Lata would drag herself out of bed and curl up in one of the Bombay fornicators kept outside on the verandah (neither she nor Ronny knew the term then), five of them in a line, and impatiently wait for Ronny to stop playing carrom and revise economics with her. Its he who needs the revision more, she would huff. But the sight of him and Molly wrapt in play also made for a pleasant picture. Once, unknown to Ronny, she had snuck his camera out of his bag and taken pictures of them.Where are those pictures? she wonders. Hadnt Ronny framed one and given it to her?When theyd broken up, shed told Kakimoni bitterly, on a weekend she was home with dark circles under her eyes, You were right. Childhood love is poisoned.Not me, Kakimoni had replied sadly, enveloping her in a hug, Sarat-babu.***The Bombay fornicators are long gone.Lata stands now where they used to be lined up and watches as the lights over the courtyard come on. It was Ghosh Mansion all this while; now, in the blink of an eye, it is transformed from a decaying house in a decaying neighbourhood into an unfamiliar place, a new continent, one where happiness and success and glory are all a handspan away for the taking.After Latad taken charge of the Molly-AJ wedding, along with the army Nimki had summoned from the massive contacts list on her phone, Ghosh Mansion had suddenly come alive in the last two days. Given the paucity of time, the rooms on the ground floor were all locked up for the evening in lieu of being cleaned (Lata kept a roster of the keys and promised the various owners of said rooms that it was a temporary matter). The corridor and the courtyard leading to the naach ghar were scrubbed clean. Not even a speck of dust should be visible to the Marwaris, Nimki was heard shouting every 10 minutes or so, Mollys mother-in-law has OCD and we better live up to her standards of cleanliness. In any case, Molly doesnt know any housework. If they see dirty corridors here, they will always link the two. FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE. Lata had also decided that since there was no time to get the walls painted, a major red herring was required. She cajoled the electrician to create a canopy of twinkling lights over the courtyard.The effect, Lata now sees, feeling quite pleased with herself, is magical.Molly steps out of Kakimonis bedroom in her engagement outfit and sighs at the lights. She wears a white chanderi full skirt trimmed beautifully in gold, paired with a post-box red choli. Much to her mothers unhappiness, shes refused to wear anything around her neck but the plain gold choker that Manjulika and Lata had given her from Manjulikas own collection and a pair of gold danglers that had been their great-grandmothers.Lata looks critically at Molly, straightens her tikli  the sole item from her parents trousseau  and then, gently kisses her cheek.I dont know what Id have done without you, Molly murmurs into her hair.Im glad I am here. And I hope you and AJ will come to London and stay with me so I can dispense jamai aador and luchis like a grown-up Ghosh.Molly squeezed her hands. Boro Jethis gold bracelet, studded with pearls and rubies, glittered. It had been a pair that, Lata knew, was given to Jethima, the eldest daughter-in-law, by their grandmother, and Jethima had given her one at her wedding, reserving the other for Molly. What about Goopys bride? Manjulika had said to Jethima then. Arre baba, Jethima had replied conspiratorially, Goopys wife will get a lot!I miss Goopy, Molly said.I was just thinking about him! Lata exclaimed, Anyway, now listen, Bobbys just texted me. They are about 15 minutes away. I think you should go now and sit in the throne room. Guests have arrived. Wheres the entourage?Almost as though theyd heard her, Mollys girlfriends, the old ones from school and college and the new ones from Berlin, all trooped out of her room, where theyd been getting ready. Their individual beauty enhanced by the collective glamour, the girls held themselves erect and frowned in concentration, speaking to each other in code. Lata did not miss a single detail of this pageantry: the wisps of hair slipping out of elaborate hairdos, the silken saris curving and catching at unaccustomed feet. They walked up to the balustrade awkwardly and then, finally finding their stride in their saris, followed Molly down the elaborate staircase, where ancestors in gilt frames looked down at them approvingly.Lata took pictures on her phone, waving the girls away, exhorting them to mind the way. A few minutes later, as they crossed the courtyard, carefully carefully, doddering on their high heels, saris and lehngas bunched up so that their calves were briefly visible, the lights fell on their youthful faces and covered them with stardust.From upstairs, in her pink-yellow tussore sari, Lata watched them and marvelled at the fierce brevity of childhood and youth.Now it was here. Alive and flickering in the stack of Mills and Boon novels under her bed, clattering upon the carrom board, surfacing in the large cupboards in the store room which were perfect for stolen kisses and the third-floor terrace which was perfect for horrible fights.And now it was gone.***First came the ashirbad and then the ring ceremony. The Jaiswals and the Ghoshes and the Germans and the assorted others all mingled happily, eating the delicious (if vegetarian) hors doeuvres and drinking gallons of Blue Lagoon.As regards the food, Boro Jethu had firmly put his feet down. At the Oberoi, they could serve whatever mishmash modern cuisine they wanted to, but at home, it would be old-fashioned comfort food. It was a gargantuan tragedy that the affair had to be made vegetarian. Yes, there would be piles of motorshutir kochuri with stuffed aloor dom and chholar dal with coconut bits. Yes, the old thakurs would whip up family secrets that would never ever be revealed to the Jaiswals. And yes, there would be five kinds of savoury fries, excluding mochar chop and five kinds of mishti, excluding doi. No chatter about calories would be entertained. No dahi vada, golgappa or that sort of rubbish would be served. They were the Ghoshes after all. And there was no question of serving any kind of fancy salad with imported leaves, olive oil and vinegar  only the time-honoured slices of cucumber, tomato and onion on a plate, along with mustard and mayonnaise.Lata had escaped the vice grip of relatives, who had far too many questions than she could handle and whose comments about how slim her waist still was and how expensive her sari looked were all lined with a certain malice. She now stood in a corner and exchanged notes about the next day with a surly Bobby. (Who looked smoky-eyed and bewitching in a black chikankari anarkali set with mukaish work on it.)Whos that? Bobby asked, suddenly interested in a man who had walked up to Nimki and had clasped her hands in his. He wore a beautifully tailored suit, in charcoal grey, and suddenly Lata found herself looking away.(To be continued)"

The prices are also significantly lower than the wholesale rates prevalent during the same time last year  tomatoes were being sold for between Rs12 and Rs35 per kg in November 2017.The retail price for this kitchen staple, however, is still steady at Rs20 per kg.In July this year, the price per kg of tomato in the wholesale market was between Rs5 and Rs 14. And the rates have been going south since then. They are now less than half of what they were in October and November 2017, the data available with the Pune Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) revealed.The tomato production this year was very good, despite drought-like conditions in parts of the state. APMC officials said the prices have dropped because the tomato supply to the wholesale market has increased.Last year, the prices were high during this period. Anticipating similar prices this year, the farmers cultivated more tomatoes in 2018 as well, said Vilas Bhujbal, the president of the Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard Traders and Agents Association. The farmers in one area grew more tomato crops without realising that their counterparts in other places too were planning on growing more tomatoes. This led to a glut in the market and the prices fell, Bhujbal added.The government should have a mechanism in place to avoid similar situations. The government should conduct studies using satellite imageries  to gauge the extent of agricultural land where a particular crop has been sown. Even the farmers can benefit from such knowledge. If too much of one particular crop has been sown in a season by some farmers, others can limit its cultivation by sowing other crops, he said.Sanjay Pawar, a farmer from Nashik, said tomato production has been bountiful in many locations this time. Apart from Nashik in Maharashtra, even places in Rajasthan and Gujarat have reported bountiful tomato crops. If production is high in Rajasthan and Gujarat as well, then there is always a possibility that tomatoes from Maharashtra will not be exported to those states as they too are experiencing a glut. Also, exports of vegetables to Pakistan have either stopped or slowed down, he said.Shriram Gadhave, the president of the Vegetables Growers Association of India, however, said that excess production of tomatoes in the current period is from regions where the water table has still not dipped considerably, despite the drought declared earlier.While tomato wholesale prices have come down, retail prices have stayed put at around Rs20 per kg. Yakub Pathan, owner of the Fresh Vegetable Market in Wakad, said, Wholesale tomato prices have come down to Rs3 to Rs6 per kg, but retailers are maintaining a status quo on the prices. Even if prices in the wholesale market increase to Rs10-Rs12 per kg, we will continue to sell tomatoes at Rs20."

Two persons including a young woman from Kerala died when a tree reportedly fell on the car she was travelling on the Kodaikanal ghat road on Friday morning and another farmer died in Vedasandur.Number of dwellings were damaged - fully and partially, low lying areas were inundated and there were complaints of flash floods in many areas. Since the TANGEDCO had switched off the electricity as a precaution, charging mobile phones became difficult and thus communication too was not possible during the day. In Dindigul city, rain water entered houses in Kakkan Nagar, Thirumalaisamypuram and other pockets. Trees were uprooted in RM Colony, MVM Nagar, NGO Colony and other stretches.According to Horticulture department officials, around 280 hectares of crops, including corn, plantain, mango, drumsticks, onion, hill banana, beans and tomato in Oddanchatram, Palani and Reddiarchatram were affected. The worst hit farms were in Kodaikanal hills. Collector T. G. Vinay, District Monitoring Officer Mangat Ram Sharma and other officials were closely monitoring the situation. As and when there were distress calls, the officials exclusively earmarked for carrying out rescue operations were rushed to the spot. Awareness to communicate and reach out to first responders saved many lives and cattle, an official told.Dam level upMany dams witnessed steady rise in inflow since forenoon. The Palar-Porundalar dam near Palani reached its full capacity. The Varadamanadhi dam was overflowing and about 6,000 cusecs of water was discharged from the reservoir. The Mavoor dam near Sirumalai had also touched its full capacity.Many pockets in and around Natham benefited from the rainfall. From as early as 3 a.m., Parali, Vathipatti, Ulupakudi, Koilpatti and other villages experienced steady rain. Tanks which were dry turned full within a few hours. The villagers, particularly, the elders expressed happiness as after nearly a decade a tank in Sithayankottai, near Athur was full. Likewise, Nochiodai tank in S Pudukottai near Krishnapuram too was full. A 100-year-old neem tree was uprooted in the rains in the town.Roads along Nilakottai, Chinnalapatti and Kanniwadi were badly damaged. Due to heavy rain and gusty wind, visibility was poor and many motorists took shelter as a precaution.Trains detainedTrains from Madurai bound for destinations like Mumbai suffered detention as the tracks were damaged. According to railway officials, the Nagercoil-Mumbai Express, Tirunelveli-Mayiladuthurai, Guruvayur-Chennai Express and others had to be detained in between Kodai Road and Ambatturai railway stations. Only after the repair works were carried out, the trains could pass the stretch at five kilometre speed.Two casualtiesTwo persons identified as Neelima, 25, wife of Jerinraj and their child Madhav, 2, were returning from Kodaikanal to Thrisur, Kerala. As the vehicle approached Kallaraimedu ghat section, a tree fell on the car, in which the woman died. In another incident, a 55-year-old man Karupasami of Venkatapuram, near Odaipatti in Oddanchatram taluk died when a tree fell on him.The rainfall recorded (in mm) in the district at 5.30 p.m. was as follows: Dindigul: 58.8, Kodaikanal: 138.50, Palani: 34.2, Chatrapatti (Oddanchatram): 26.2, Natham: 44, Nilakottai: 93, Vedasandur: 22, Vedasandur (Tobacco station): 22, Kamatchipuram: 60, Kodaikanal Boat Club: 130 mm.

She loves to cook and wrote her first recipe book, Miss Masala: Real Indian Cooking for Busy Living, around eight years ago. Mallika Basu  former Bengal chief minister Jyoti Basus granddaughter  has more kitchen wisdom and scrumptious meals to share in her second cookbook, Masala. Sprinkled with memories of Sunday lunches with her politician grandfather and secret recipes from her north Indian maternal grandmother, Mallika has whipped up a delicious hardback of slow feasts, classic curries, sweet treats, quick fixes and more. We caught up with her on an email chat.What inspired you to write a cookbook, as there are several on Indian cuisine already?This is a very personal book that was inspired by my own experience of trying to fit Indian cooking into a busy family, social and professional life.I use a lot of cookbooks and found myself finding ways to simplify the recipes in them and the recipe instructions being given to me by my family. A lot of Indian recipes are based on nostalgia and age-old traditions, but we dont live the way our parents and grandparents did. Even my mother (theatre veteran Dolly Basu) and her friends use great little shortcuts to make food simpler to cook and more wholesome.I found myself reaching for gadgets, innovative food products/ingredients, and easy cheats that dont compromise on flavour. I saw a gap in the market for an Indian cookbook that reflects the way we live now  for busy people, who dont have much help in the kitchen and want to get wholesome, delicious food on the table for friends and family.The design aesthetic of contemporary India was also important for me to reflect. The Western view of India is all elephants and paisley, despite the beautiful, minimalist Indian design I have been enjoying. We were keen to capture the texture and colours of handloom, architecture and nature in the look and feel of the book.How did you go about curating the dishes?I started with mealtime moments. We Indians love our breakfast, and there is a huge trend of lazy brunches, so that had to be a chapter. I also love entertaining, so feasts needed to feature. Then I included family favourites from my homes in Calcutta and London. A lot of recipes from Delhi feature, where my mum is from and where I worked briefly. Then there are several Bengali recipes. But importantly, we were a cosmopolitan bunch and recipes from other communities featured too. I am very influenced by Gujarati food, for instance, and I travelled extensively in Kerala, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and even researched Calcutta food. So recipes from there feature too.Masala has many anecdotes from your childhood, involving your grandfather Jyoti Basu. What was your relationship with him like?It was like any other relationship between a doting grandfather and his besotted granddaughter. Dadu called me his crown princess and was keenly interested in my academic and other achievements. When I participated in a beauty contest and came last, it didnt stop him from driving his convoy straight to our home and chanting beauty queen, beauty queen as he came up the stairs to see me. He looked so glum in photos but he sprung to life and smiles when he was around us. When I got married, his one concern was that I would give up my career. So I think hed be proud that I have not one but three full-blown ones, including motherhood!Any food memory from your childhood that comes to mind?Sunday lunch was a big tradition at our home (in Salt Lake). I always remember lazy afternoons with lilting Bollywood tunes, vodka cocktails for the grown-ups, my dad (Chandan Basu) stirring slowly and the kids filling up on chanachur while lunch took ages to cook. I also have not-so-fond memories of driving my mother crazy at mealtimes. I was a very fussy eater and skinny child. My poor mother oversaw the most amazing food, which I would reject without even trying. I did eventually grow out of it though, as is probably evident!An easy version of burgers  Chappli Kebab Picture from Mallikas InstagramIn the book, you mention that you have been influenced by your maternal grandmother a lot...Nani is a proper matriarch with Afghan blood in her. She was actively involved in our parenting and a strong influence on food, culture and others. I used to travel with her to Delhi for my winter holidays and have the best time. She gave up non-vegetarian food when she lost her husband, but still cooked excellent chicken curry. Thanks to her, I enjoyed the best of Delhi home cooking  rajma chawal, kadhi pakora, gajar methi, and parathas stuffed with absolutely everything.I called her when I was writing Masala and we had an awkward conversation, as she is hard of hearing, until I asked her for her recipe of nimbu ka achaar. She sprung to life and after much testing, the recipe has now been perfected for modern kitchens and is in my book.To be honest, I had all manner of busy people in mind. A lot of my followers are young families, professionals without kids and silver surfers who are enjoying their kitchens and cooking in a new way. I live in London, so some of the recipes do need to be adapted for international kitchens but its never complicated and nothing an instinctive regular cook cant manage. I know a lot of Indians who move away from home to study, or to get married or for work. They buy my book because they find the recipes are so doable and always taste right.In the age of quick tutorial videos, do you see a cookbook being relevant?Absolutely. Quick tutorial videos are great, but there is only so much you can cram into a short video. Cookbooks are increasingly being bought for longevity, because they offer something over and beyond just recipes. A video tutorial can never replace that.Is cooking a passion or is it just a hobby or something more?All of the above. I find it very relaxing and often cook after a long day to unwind. But more than that I am passionate about addressing misperceptions about Indian cooking that exist. Its not as complicated, difficult and time consuming as people think. Thats what got me writing about food. All you need is know-how, great recipes and a fantastic cookbook.Channa Dal, Mustard Prawn Curry, and two favourites  Peas Pulao and Saag Aloo Picture from Mallikas InstagramAt home, what kind of cooking would we find in your kitchen?I often use my own cookbook, so thats very much the kind of Indian food you would eat if you came to my home. I love other cuisines, and so Indian dishes take pride of place alongside Chinese, Japanese, Persian, Italian and much more. My family loves variety; the kids especially are gourmet babies, with a very wide-ranging palate and love for food and cooking. So its a mixed bag. The food is always wholesome, well balanced and simply cooked.What kind of influence does your husbands half-Peruvian and half-British heritage have on your cooking?I was quite lucky that Peruvians like flavour and lots of chillies! I never had to tone down our spicier dishes for him... We met at university in London through Gujarati friends and the rest, as they say, is history!How much of Indian culture are your kids exposed to?They call themselves half-Indian and love dressing up in their festive Indian clothes and eating Indian food. I often make dosas and chillas at home for weekend breakfast, which they eat before you can wink. And they love going on holiday to India. Sadly, I havent been great at teaching them Hindi or Bengali. Still they are only small so there is hope!How do you make time for this alongside a career in communications?They say if you want something done, give it to a busy person! But seriously, I have been very blessed with the support of my husband, my family and friends. I also gave up a full-time role in communications in favour of consulting, so I now have a portfolio career that allows me the flexibility of enjoying my day job and indulging my passion. Hopefully, I am living proof of my own unique difference  that I am a busy home cook writing delicious recipes that work for other busy home cooks.What is next in the cooking space for you?I am still busy promoting the book and it is such a labour of love that I am trying to slow down and savour every minute. Watch this space for my next venture!Macchli Curry (Simple Fish Curry) Source: MasalaRecipe for Macchli Curry(Simple Fish Curry) (Serves 2-4)Coated in turmeric and chilli and simmered in a gently spiced curry, this is a very simple way to enjoy fish with the lightest of spices. Fish in India comes from both the fresh waters of its lakes and rivers and from the sea. Although foreign varieties such as basa are gaining popularity in restaurants and supermarkets, the morning trip to the fish market for the catch of the day remains a firm tradition in the fish-loving states. In Bengal, for instance, this is traditionally a job for the man of the house, who prides himself on his masterful bargaining with the sellers. Serve Macchli Curry with freshly steamed rice.300-400g monkfishcod loin or other meaty white fish (cut into chunks)tsp ground turmerictsp chilli powdertsp salt, 2tbsp oil1 bay leaf1 medium onion chopped2.5cm fresh root ginger (finely grated)2 garlic cloves (finely grated)2tbsp tomato puree250ml (1 cup) hot watertsp garam masalacoriander leaves (to garnish)Method"

Silver anklets made in Salem are popular across the country and worldwide and the industry employs a large work force round the year.A resolution adopted at the 16th district level conference of the DYFI here recently said that online trading had hit the silver crafts industry to a big extent and urged the government ban the same.Another resolution said that a large number of farmers were involved in raising flowers in Panamarathupatti and surrounding villages. They were not getting adequate price during the lean period. The government should take initiative to set up a perfume unit in Panaimarathupatti to benefit these farmers.Similarly, Mecheri and surrounding areas were famous for tomatoes. The tasty Mecheri tomatoes had good demand even in the neighbouring states. The setting up of a tomato juice manufacturing unit in Mecheri would immensely benefit the farmers in improving their livelihood.Yet another resolution demanded creation of additional infrastructure in the Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital.The government should remove encroachments from its lands and provide the same as free house site pattas to the weaker sections, and initiate steps to protect the handloom and powerloom units situated in and around Jalagandapuram.P. Kandasamy, district president of the DYFI, presided and C. Balachandrabose, its State vice-president, inaugurated the event. R. Ramesh, district secretary of the All India Students Federation, spoke.The following were elected new office-bearers: P. Kandasamy (president); A. Baggiaraj and M. Karpagam (vice-presidents); P. Ganesan (secretary) and V. Venkatesh (treasurer)."
5ce7064ae8e3fc56af416abd,A rendezvous to remember,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/a-rendezvous-to-remember/article25459545.ece,2018-11-10,"It was the day before Deepavali and we had planned to go out and have some salads at a new place I had been hearing good things about. But we had a look at the manic traffic, and changed our minds. Just the day before, I had been caught in the traffic for what seemed like hours. So, I decided that Id look up Zomato and order something exciting from our part of town.A few minutes of surfing later, I zeroed in on what looked promising  a delivery outlet called Rendezvous Calcutta in Noida. I called up and was told that it has been around for a while, has mostly Bengali food and delivers through Swiggy.Fresh and well-cookedI had an interesting chat with Chef Madhumita, who runs the place (phone numbers: 0120-4267726 and 8826743456). The food is all prepared fresh, so they have to be given some time to cook and deliver. The recipes are authentic, she said, and brushed off one of the Bengali food delivery places that I rather like as not genuine. And she helped me choose our order. We decided on a plate of dhokar dalna (Rs. 160), aloo posto (Rs. 145), shukto (Rs. 145), bori-aloo maachh jhol (Rs. 255), maachher kalia (Rs. 210) and tomato chatni (Rs. 70).The food came within the hour. And we had a delicious lunch, for the dishes, as the chef had promised, were fresh and well cooked. I had the dhokar dalna, which is a dish of steamed besan cakes in thick gravy that I really enjoy. It was superb; the cakes were soft, and the gravy was nice and tasty. I like my aloo posto with more posto (khus-khus, or poppy seed paste) than aloo, but in many kitchens it is cooked the other way around. In Rendezvous, too, it was more of a potato dish than posto. But it had a nice flavourful taste.The shukto, which is usually a cooling summer dish of vegetables in a light sauce, was delicious. It had a mix of vegetables, and the right balance of mildly sweet and bitter tastes. The two fish dishes were outstanding. There were large chunks of potato and fried bori (lentil balls) in bori-aloo maachh jhol, while the maachher kalia gravy was rich and sumptuous. The fish was fresh, and the pieces were large. Most of the gravies were hot, which I enjoyed after months of a low chilli diet. The tomato chatni, however, wasnt all that exciting. I must say Ive had better.Elaborate menuI didnt try out the meat dishes, but will order in another day. They have kosha mutton (Rs. 210), railway mutton (Rs. 375), chicken rezala (Rs. 375) and chicken curry (Rs. 360). There are other kinds of fish dishes, too  such as pabda tomato jhal (Rs. 240) and shorshe pabda (Rs. 230). Vegetarians can try out the aloor dum (Rs. 120), phul kopir dalna (Rs. 145), doi potol (Rs. 145), chholar dal (Rs. 100) and begun bhaja (Rs. 50). They have biryanis and rolls, breakfast fare such as radha bollobhi (stuffed puris with aloo) and snacks such as fish fries and chops.Madhumita tells me that she is not a trained chef, but has always been interested in cooking. She used to be a marketing professional, and then decided to get into the food business. I am glad she did!"
