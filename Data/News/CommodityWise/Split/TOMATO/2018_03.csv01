5ce7140de8e3fc56af4170f3,More a political pamphlet than a movie,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/more-a-political-pamphlet-than-a-movie/article25440667.ece,2018-11-08,"Director Murugadoss is well known to have that one interesting sequence thats the result of a strong idea. In Thuppaki , we saw that when Vijay gets the help of his fellow army men to stop terrorist attacks happening across the city.In Kaththi , we saw it when Vijay ropes in senior citizens to stop water supply to the city. Even in the recent Spyder, we saw the hero (Mahesh Babu) getting the help of housewives to stop a crime.Sarkar has a long run-time but lacks that one Brand ARM sequence that could have changed the tone of the film. At 163 minutes, it comes across more like a political pamphlet.Vijay is named Sundar Ramaswamy in the film and it looks like his name was coined by mixing the names of Googles CEO and Chennais firebrand activist who has traffic for a sobriquet. Hes globally renowned to be a corporate monster who takes over companies wherever he goes, but hes now in India to cast his vote. But theres a hitch: his vote has already been cast.That much has already been revealed thanks to the trailers, and the first half of Sarkar thankfully takes it one step further. Theres an evil politician (Masilamani, played by Pazha Karuppiah, and as clichd as they come) who is out to ruin the state. Can Sundar  with all his corporate experience (he calls himself a corporate criminal)  stop him from that? Can Sundars wisdom come in handy in rectifying malpractice that has become quite prevalent in Tamil Nadu polls?It is a promising premise and a much-needed one, considering that all of us yearn for change and development, but Sarkar just scratches the surface by putting together a story based on a few recent incidents in the State. It reels off laws and the electoral processes (theres an entire eye-opening-but-lecture-like stretch on Section 49P) just to support Vijays decision to stay back in Chennai and clean the system.The problem with Sarkar is that it has no well-defined characters. Keerthy Suresh has nothing much to do than keep walking with Vijay (literally) while Yogi Babu has a blink-and-miss appearance. It is Varalaxmi who steals the cake, essaying a smooth performance. Sarkar would have been better off had she been introduced earlier.The dialogues, though powerful, reel off much longer than they ought to be. What could have been said in two words: Go vote (admittedly a much-needed social message) gets the entire length of the film, replete with dance and fights.Theres an entire sequence featuring Vijay narrating the story of a tomato that got the claps, but looks oddly out of place. But in these dialogue-heavy sequences that Vijay gets into the act  his control over the emotional sequences is admirable, while hes aggressive in the ones that require him to go a little over-the-top.AR Rahmans songs dont help him much  except the call-for-revolution number Oru Viral, they dont contribute much to take the story forward.Watching Sarkar , I kept thinking of an earlier much-loved Murugadoss film, Ramana (2002), which had Vijayakant taking on corrupt officials. That had the protagonist as a professor but it is Sarkar that feels like the lecture."

This experience is a must, specially if you are on a romantic getaway.Ambur Biryani Malancha DasguptaFor dinner, there was the Kodai special Ambur Biryani. Being a stickler for biryani with aloo, I had my doubts, which vanished when the Ambur Biryani arrived and I finished it in one go.

Malancha DasguptaOff to strawberry farmWhen we had set out for the strawberry farm, I imagined it to be like any other plantation but the closer we got, it started looking anything but a manicured farm. The roads meandered through the hills and after a point all you can see is wild nature and rolling hills. This strawberry farm is in the middle of nowhere and thats the best bit about it. The owner explained the process and gave us strawberries to taste. They also keep freshly-made strawberry jam and jelly that you can buy.Malancha DasguptaAdventure zoneAdd adventure to your trip at Sterling Kodai Lake and youve got your adrenaline rushing.

I am always blown away by the quality of food and wine, informed, friendly service and charming down-to-earth no-nonsense Australian attitude to life. There is a humility and dignity which is refreshing and very new world. Sydney is the perfect first stop Down Under and what a foodie paradise it is!Start your journey on Singapore Airlines, not the national carrier Qantas. You wont regret it. Apart from the seamless service, great big seats and plenty of legroom, the food and drinks are outstanding. SIA has won the prestigious award for the Best Overall Wine Cellar 2017.If youre in the rarefied atmosphere of first class, they serve Krug 2004 Champagne and one of the best Aussie wines, a Pinot Noir from Paringa Estate. In business and in all the lounges, youll be very happy with the delicious Charles Heidsieck Brut Reserve. The food is designed by a panel of international chefs, so youll find Indian, Asian and Australian menus on routes Down Under and fabulous illy single-origin coffees, TWG teas, cocktails and mocktails, all served with a smile.Sydney SeaplanesReady for a bit of the high life? The luxury seaplane operator offers sightseeing tours in a classic Beaver aircraft. Whether its a scenic flight over the beautiful Sydney Harbour, a flying journey of the golden sandy Northern Beaches, a romantic picnic for two on a secluded beach, or the best taxi ride to one of Sydneys river or ocean restaurants  Sydney Seaplanes will get you there in style. They take off from Rose Bay, which you can reach by either taxi or even better, a lovely inexpensive ferry ride from Circular Quay. On a fine day, the dashing young pilots in shorts are happy to take you on a scenic tour of Sydney over the Opera House and Harbour Bridge, down along many of Sydneys beautiful northern beaches and harbours to our destination, which happened to be Whale Beach, a stretch of pristine white sand and spectacular views. It would normally take an hour or so to reach here by car from Sydney but in the seaplane it takes only 20 minutes.Tasmanian Pacific Oysters with rice wine vinaigrette at Tetsuyas, which is owned by Tetsuya Wakuda (below) Sourced by The TelegraphTetsuyas restaurantYes, believe it or not, there are some really world-class food experiences to be had in the city. One of my favourite fine dining restaurants is Tetsuyas, which combines a masterful blend of skill, artistry and taste. Tetsuya Wakudas attention to detail is consistent and beyond sublime. Signature dishes include the confit of Ocean trout, consomme of tomato and tea, Tasmanian Pacific oysters with rice wine vinaigrette, tuna with daikon and wasabi, sea scallops with lemonade fruit and yuzu, and the sashimi of hamachi (kingfish) with blood orange and vinaigrette.The petuna ocean trout dish has been served in the restaurant ever since it was a humble first-floor dwelling in a very ordinary suburb of Sydney. Tetsuya was the first chef to discover this fish and to source many wonderful products from all over Australia. Do not leave without trying the warm kombu bread and truffle butter served regularly in between courses. Not that you need any more food but this is a must-do. Tetsuyas only does a degustation menu  10 courses paired with world wines. There is no a la carte. Each dish is truly a culinary masterpiece. If you have the time, budget and inclination (youll have to reserve way in advance), dont miss it. Aus $240 pp for the whole experience.Bondi Beach Sourced by The TelegraphBondi BeachI heard plenty about Bondi Beach but had not realised that it has a sub-culture of its own. Its not just a series of serious beaches (Bondi/Tamarama/Bronte) but an area of great restaurants, cafes and shops which makes Bondi a real Sydney suburb worth talking about well beyond the hippie image it once had. Musts to visit in the area are Camilla for silk kaftans, Gertrude & Alice for books and coffee, and Icebergs for the most spectacular lunch overlooking Bondi Beach. Its not just a restaurant serving outstanding food (not surprisingly a huge variety of seafood and Italian), its a style statement. And dont forget to listen to Bondi 88 FM, the local radio station, while you are there.Jonahs offers an excellent view and seafood Sourced by The TelegraphJonahsPerhaps the only feature that can divert your attention from the stunning view at Jonahs is the exceptional food and wine offering. The award-winning hatted restaurant offers excellent contemporary Australian cuisine under the direction of chef Matteo Zamboni. They were the recipient of Australias Wine List of the Year Awards in 2017 by Gourmet Traveller with a cellar containing over 11,000 bottles of vintage Australian and international wines and a wine list of more than 1,600 different labels.Apart from the fabulous food and wine, Jonahs is a little luxury getaway with 11 beautiful rooms, all with stunning sea views, a spa and all the trimmings. The seafood platter for lunch which consists of a deck of raw and cured fish and oysters to crayfish thermidor and warm Coffin Bay scallops along with a glass of Aussie Arras sparkling, is a must-have. And yes, an added bonus is that you can spot whales as they migrate between May and November.Sydney Opera House Sourced by The TelegraphSydney Opera HouseGo for a guided tour or, even better, go see an opera at any of their six halls.

Rocking the city with their edgy, quirky design, happening F&B spaces, bars and beautifully decorated contemporary rooms, QT Sydney shares the building with two of the citys most majestic historical buildings, Gowings and The State Theatre. The eccentricity of the hotel is offset by the historical features of the building, such as the blend of gothic, art deco, and Italian-influenced architecture. Although I didnt stay at the QT, the vibe intrigued me as I walked in off the busy and bustling Market Street where most of the high-end shopping, restaurants and bars are. I was hoping that quirky didnt stretch to the bedrooms and was pleasantly surprised at the comfort level of their spacious rooms. Apart from this, it seems to be the place for the wild, wacky and cool crowd to party.A salad of spring peas stracciatella, smoked almonds, rye crumble, asparagus and tomato chutney Sourced by The TelegraphBennelong RestaurantUpmarket yet relaxed, Bennelong Restaurant is an absolute treat for lunch. The bar is literally under the Opera Houses shell vaulted sails with spectacular views over the Harbour Bridge. The restaurant with huge glass panels overlooks Circular Quay and the Harbour. The menu is based on award-winning chef Peter Gilmores vision of Australian cuisine. Incidentally, he also runs the other culinary icon in Sydney, Quay restaurant which is just opposite. You can choose from a two- or three-course a la carte menu with service starting early, catering to the pre-theatre dining crowd. Dishes to go for are the salad of spring peas, smoked almonds, asparagus and tomato chutney; wild cape york barramundi and the mooloolaba yellowfin tuna with kohlrabi remoulade. Benelong offers 180 of the countrys favourite and small-scale wine labels from an eclectic collection of winemakers. This is quintessential Sydney for me.An usual evening at Bennelong Restaurant Sourced by The TelegraphSydney fish market Sourced by The TelegraphSydney fish marketFirstly, unlike many fish markets I have visited round the world, it doesnt smell fishy. The variety of Australian seafood alone is quite staggering  from Tasmanian giant abalone and crabs weighing 17kg to prawns, crayfish, Moreton Bay bugs, marons, Balmain bay bugs (all Aussie crustaceans), rock lobster and, of course, oysters galore. Each fishmonger in addition to selling fish has ready-to-eat dishes, including sushi, lobster thermidor and shucked oysters. If that isnt enough, there are plenty of restaurants both within the market and outside where you can enjoy a seafood lunch in comfort.On the first floor is the Sydney seafood school, which conducts cookery classes. On certain days of the week, they also have master classes by Sydneys top chefs. Although most of the classes are over $100 for a two- or three-hour class, lunch or dinner and a glass of wine is included. For someone who really enjoys cooking, this is a must-do. Classes run throughout the week but there seems to be a better choice over the weekend. Check for substantial discounts if youre a group of six or more.Hyatt Sydney Sourced by The TelegraphRock a 180-degree viewLocation. Location. Location. Whoever said that must have been thinking about the Hyatt Sydney. Right opposite the Opera House, under the Harbour Bridge on the edge of the fashionable area known as The Rocks, the Park Hyatt is the place to stay in Sydney if you want a view to beat all views. Choose one of the suites on the circular front of the hotel and youll have a 180-degree view of the Opera House as your 25ft electric curtains draw open. It also has one of the citys nicest restaurants on the ground floor facing the boardwalk and Sydney Harbour.Karen Anand is a culinary consultant, food writer and entrepreneur.

But even as they speak, memories of the times he spent at GM long ago come flooding back to him. Lata, meanwhile, tries to solve the blown-fuse problem before heading off to soothe Molly, whose meticulously laid plans are on the verge of unravelling.On the days that his mother worked late, Josh Sen, custodian of the plum-headed parakeets Optimus Prime and Max, would convince his dad, distinguished professor of something very important but difficult to remember, to drive by the Kharkai and Subarnarekha rivers. Not that Vikramjit needed much convincing. He loved the Marine Drive (though he would have preferred a different name, one which did not invariably occasion the patronising Oh yes, the other Marine Drive nod-and-head-bob from Bombaywallahs).Sometimes they would chat  updates about ones birds or the others students were exchanged  but, mostly, Josh would roll down the window (something his mother never allowed since the breeze interfered with her hair), stick his head out, and let the wind slap noisily against his cheeks. His father, who had grown up with dogs, delighted in his sons canine behaviour, folded up the sleeves of his Brooks Brothers shirts, and sang along to the radio. Eventually, they ended up at Brubeck, back in the city, and gorged on cakes. Tilo monitored Joshs refined sugar intake during the week strictly, but father and son had perfected the art of operating on a strict what-Tilo-doesnt-know-cant-hurt-Tilo principle.Should we check in on Pixie and her folks? Vik asked Josh that evening, after they had completed their usual run and turned towards the city again.Josh took his time to reply. He could be reflective after his drawing class.Before or after we order the cake? Josh asked finally.If we go before, we could take some cakes for them. If we go after, we could bring Pixie with us to Brubeck. And order the cake then. It all depends on how hungry you are now.Not hungry. Miss gave us lots of cookies, Josh replied. His drawing teacher was a flaky young Parsi artist who lived in one of those beautiful rambling colonial buildings and seemed to survive only on cookies and milk, which she set out before her students as she randomly showed them great works of art projected on the living room wall. The kids adored Miss Daruwalla.Dont mention the cookies to Ma though. She might give Miss...A lecture. I know. What happened to your healthy snack, by the way?Josh rummaged in his bag and extracted a little tiffin-box, in posh blue chrome, and presented to his father. Vik, who had his own chrome blue box in his bag somewhere, quickly wolfed down the cold quinoa cutlet with its side of home-made tomato relish. He could not stand quinoa and the coldness settled like an icy chrome-blue feeling in his stomach, with angry red lashings curling around it, like memories of the tomato relish. Lets go over to their guest house then and see how Pixie is settling in?Josh handed his father his water bottle, also chrome blue.Is Pixie going to be invited to my birthday? Josh sounded neutral enough.I am sure, Vik replied, allowing the water to unglue himself from that feeling, handing the bottle back to his son and starting the car. In fact, Tilo has probably already invited them. Why?She will go on and on about London. And my friends will find her lame.Now now, Vik said, accelerating the car.And then we went St James Park, and then we had tea with the Queen, Josh mimicked Pixies accent, in an accurate if cruel fashion. Maybe shell expect an Enid Blyton kind of high tea? With meringues and potted meat and ham and sardines and jam tarts.Vik narrowed his eyes and looked at his son.Josh Sen, is that what you want?Whaatt? Josh said innocently.***Several well-appointed flats, airy and central, had been turned by the company into a group of serviced apartments, which offered greater privacy to long-term residents than the old-fashioned guesthouses. A centralised hospitality desk offered luxuries such as room service and turn down (which, since shed had to pick up after everyone in London, felt like an unbelievable luxury to Nisha) and the kitchen provided food which, while not exciting, was adequate.One such apartment, off Kadma, was currently occupied by the Das Biswas-es, and its living room, with white walls, regulation sofas and severe landscapes, was currently caught in a terrific squall. Nisha was firm. The polka-dotted puppy who had been found under the mango tree must be returned to that spot. She had a toddler; she was not going to get another creature to look after; she was already at the verge of a nervous breakdown.But I am going to look after him myself, Mama, I promise, I promise, Pixie wailed. And Lisa Didi can help me. Lisa was the nanny. She lurked in the doorway and followed the war. She had fed some milk to the puppy and was on his side.Lisa Didi has her hands full. So do I. We will go back and return the puppy. I cant believe you smuggled him in when we expressly told you not to!Nishas face was thunderous. Bappa hovered around the flat  unable to take a stand  and had now decided to escape inside and call up admin to find out about the serviced apartments policy on pets.Pixie, equally firm, announced that if the puppy was going back to the mango tree, so was she. Lisa Didi, pack my bag, Pixie called out.Nisha couldnt decide what she should be madder about. The damn dog. Or her daughter ordering about Lisa so blithely.Pixie, Nisha began ominously when there were footsteps outside and the bell rang.Bappa reappeared, phone glued to his ears, and breathed a sigh of relief after he opened the door.Vikramjitda, welcome, welcome. We have a bit of a situation here. In fact, you can help! Come in please. Hello, Josh.The puppy, meanwhile, had hopped off Pixies lap and wandered towards the door.Woofwoof, he said to Josh.Woofwoof, replied Josh in return.Pixie snatched him up.I didnt know you had a dog, Josh said, as he came and sat next to her.She doesnt, Nisha said coldly. That dogs going.She forced herself to smile at Vik. Tea? Coffee? No Tilo?Having gauged the situation, Vik decided that it was better he sat. The puppy cast its soulful eyes on him. I wouldnt mind some tea, he said, But only if its no trouble. Tilo is working late today. We were going to Brubeck and thought wed take Pixie along if thats okay.Tea is no trouble, Nisha replied and made her way to the kitchen.Whats his name? Josh whispered, conspiratorially.Scone, Pixie whispered back.What? Josh narrowed his eyes exactly like his father.S-C-O-N-E, spelt out Pixie, now no longer whispering, Its pronounced scon, like don, not scone like cone.Josh digested this.Meanwhile, Scone Das Biswas had laid his little puppy head on Joshs knee. Despite his dislike for Pixie gathering up again, into a pulsating ball of annoyance, Josh couldnt help but fall a little in love with the polka-dotted creature, who wasnt a patch on his birds of course, but was, nonetheless, a delightful thing to love. He stroked his velvety ears gently. And that Pixie did not say anything to that. Instead, she looked beseechingly at her father and his friend. Soon, fat tears rolled down her cheeks one by one.***It was around 11.30 that Nisha returned to their bedroom. She was freshly showered. Though shed dried her hair, a few curls were still damp and clung to her cheeks. Postos asleep, she said and sat at the dressing table, applying cream on her cheeks.Nisha smiled at Bappa in the mirror and a load lifted off his chest.So is your daughter and that Scone. He is ensconced  or should we say en-scone-d now?  in her bed. Lisa is sitting there looking at him adoringly. I hope she still pays attention to Posto!Nisha got under the duvet and folded her body against her husbands.So your friend Vikramjit is quite the convincer. Should have gone into law!He was a famous debater baba, Bappa replied, taking her hand in his, leaning in to her. Long day, today, he said.Nishas hair smelt all coconut-y and familiar. Bappa felt himself descend into the sort of semi-comfortable space that might just develop an edge and lead to some (long, overdue) action.How much do you think professors earn at that B-school? Nisha asked him.Sorry, what? Bappa said, a little surprised at this new turn.Vikramjit and Tilottama  how much do you think they earn?Hmm, said Bappa, considering the matter.To be continued"

This will impact vegetable production after the next two-three months. The tomato prices may rise to Rs 80/kg in April next year, he said.Vilas Shinde, managing director at Sahyadri Farmers Producer Company Ltd, said, Vegetable plantations have already dipped in vegetable growing regions. Our sources in nurseries, which provide vegetable plants to farmers for planting, are reporting a 50% dip in their October orders.He said the area from Nashik to Marathwada , including Aurangabad and Jalna, may see a dip in vegetable plantation mainly, the effect of which might will become apparent as early as December. A 30% dip in vegetable produce is expected in the near future as vegetable planting has already begun dipping. Some effect on vegetable production in eastern Pune might also be seen, in locations like Indapur, Baramati and Solapur , Shinde added.Gadhave said places that do not have canal irrigation facilities were witnessing a dipping water table in October, a phenomenon which usually occurs in January. Farmers may, therefore, refrain from sowing vegetables, he said.He said most areas in the state recorded less rainfall this monsoon. It is due to this reason that Western Maharashtra, where a bulk of vegetables are grown, may also see a dip in production. No impact on potatoes, however, is expected as most of its production will happen before January 2019, he said.A state horticulture department official said the state government has declared a drought-like situation in 128 talukas, reporting trigger 2 conditions. A bulk of vegetables in the state is produced in regions with canal irrigation. However, the regions where this form of irrigation is not available may see an impact of the water scarcity , a situation which may worsen in January and February, he said.Another state horticulture department said the water situation is not that severe in major vegetable producing regions, such as Pune, Satara, Kolhapur , Sangli, Sangamner, Nashik, west Ahmednagar, which fall on the west side of the state, as the dams are full in the Western Ghat region."

However, market research department at the Tamil Nadu Agriculture University (TNAU) said tomato prices were likely to improve after the onset of northeast monsoon.A price advisory from the university attributed the drop in the prices to steady arrival of tomato to local markets from Karnataka. Once the monsoon sets in, transport of the crop from the neighbouring state might get hit and as a result tomato prices might go up in the state.Tomato is being sold at Rs 19-Rs 23 per kg in retail stores and markets, while the farm gate price is around Rs 11-Rs 13 per kg. However, maintaining and harvesting the crop is labour intensive and heavy rain had led to some spoilage, Veerappa, a farmer from Thondamuthur, said. We need at least 15 per kg to sustain ourselves.The major tomato producing districts in the state are Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri, Salem, Tiruppur, Theni and Dindigal."

Food Processing Industries Federation president P. Bhaskar Rao said Chittoor had been the leading producer of tomato in the State and had a substantial share in the national market.But, since it is a perishable commodity and the farmers and also entrepreneurs are struggling to earn minimum returns from it, the Union government has stepped in to alleviate their plight. The ODOP scheme is applicable for processing industries in food parks established by both the Central and the State governments.Tremendous scopeLike all other agriculture and horticulture crops, only about 5% of tomato is processed, which provides a tremendous scope for venturing into the business of adding value to it.Food parksMr. Rao pointed out that the Andhra Pradesh government was promoting 12 food parks with its own budget in addition to the Central government-sponsored Srini Food Park in Chittoor and Mallavalli Mega Food Park in Krishna district and the one dedicated for aquaculture namely the Godavari Mega Aqua Food Park at Bhimavaram in West Godavari district.Processing unitsIn all, 20 to 25 food parks had been sanctioned by the Centre across the country, but the State had taken the task of promoting the processing units upon itself by setting up its own parks in view of the great importance of the rich variety of crops to its economy and the livelihood of lakhs of farmers."

We are already No.1 in the country in papaya, mango, banana and chilli crops and will soon become a horticultural hub, he said.Recalling the upheaval among farmers due to the glut and the resultant lack of remunerative prices for mango, turmeric, chilli, jowar and maize in the last few years, he emphasised on looking beyond the traditional farming practices and embrace new technologies both to cut down cost and overcome the vagaries of monsoon.The amount spent towards market intervention fund by this government in the last four years is Rs. 3,800 crore against the paltry Rs. 340 crore spent by the previous government during 2009-14 for the combined State, he pointed out.Dig at CentreThe State government did go the extra mile by increasing the quantum of support during disasters, he said and flayed the Centre for remaining nonchalant. We tripled the quantum of support for the 4.7 lakh coconut trees uprooted in Uttarandhra region during the recent Titli cyclone, without waiting for the Centre. It is always the State government that is answerable to the people."

The company, which already has brands like Sugar Free and Nutralite, the addition of Complan and Glucon-D, is expected to strengthen its equity in the consumer wellness segment. Further, its range of skincare products under Everyuth is also expected to be complimented with the inclusion of Nycil.Apart from the four brands, ZWL will also get two large manufacturing facilities in Aligarh and Sitarganj and teams devoted to operations, research, sales, marketing and support. Heinz India has a strong distribution network of over 800 distributors, more than 20,000 wholesalers covering 29 states.Among these brands, Heinz India recorded revenues of about Rs 1,150 crore for the 12 month period ended June 30. Following this acquisition, Zydus Wellness will have consolidated revenues of about Rs 1,700 crore.This development offers immense opportunity to broaden our portfolio and invest in brands and products that we believe are most relevant to health conscious consumers. This acquisition will be an ideal addition to Zydus Wellness, supporting our aspirations to grow in the consumer wellness space by providing multiple choices to consumers, Sharvil Patel, chairman, Zydus Wellness, said while commenting on the deal."
