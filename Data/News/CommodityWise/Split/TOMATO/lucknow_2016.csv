Similarly, rate of seasonal fruits imported from other states and countries have increased by 35% to 50%.Wholesale dealer at the galla mandi Manish Rastogi said potatoes are perishable in nature and come from nearby areas like Kannauj.

And this diversity is best reflected in what's cooking in the kitchens and what's served on the tables on Christmas Day. And Hyderabad, a melting pot of myriad cultures, is where you will get to see some of the best of Christmas feasts from across the country being dished out, come Sunday. Hyderabad Times goes on pre-Christmas gastronomic tour to see what's on the menu. And what we discovered has already left us craving for Christmas, literally!In many Anglo Indian homes Christmas seems like a month-long affair, what with the rose cookies and kulkuls being made, the cake mix getting ready, and homemade wine being bottled. But the real deal, according to Chris Brown, a hospitality executive, is Christmas dinner. ""We go all out to make it a lavish affair and we look forward to it with much anticipation. Roast Turkey or Duck is one dish you will find in every Anglo Indian home for Christmas. The bird is marinated overnight, and the stuffing consists of boiled vegetables and mashed potatoes. The bird is then tied with twine and roasted along with herbs and spices like thyme, rosemary, black pepper, bay leaves and garlic. Some families even bake it,"" says Chris , a Sainikpuri resident. And what's a roast without a sauce! ""The cranberry or strawberry sauce is what brings the roast to life! We drizzle it over the meat. The usual side dishes include bread rolls, Pork chops or Grilled Spare Ribs and salad with vegetables like carrots, peas, Brussel sprouts and broccoli. This hearty meal is washed down with Ginger Pop or home-made wine. For dessert, there's the plum cake, crumble cake or fruit pudding with custard for dessert,"" says Chris.There's nothing like some good ol' spicy mutton curry and steaming hot rice. It's simple, but packs a punch, and the Telugu Christians swear by it. ""Once we're back from church, the women of the house get into the kitchen to prepare the spiciest and heartiest meal of the year. The non-vegetarian fare is in abundance and Christmas lunch is one meal where the number of helpings aren't counted. We make Bagara Rice and spicy mutton curry. The curry is made with a base of dry coconut and some chopped potatoes which adds that extra flavour. And on Christmas, Telugu Christians can't just restrict our meal to one type of meat; we need to have chicken as well. So there will be naatu kodi fry or curry as well"", says Annie Merlyn, a sales professional. The resident of Mahendra Hills adds, ""Some families do it the Deccani way by preparing a handi full of mutton biryani, and the aroma just wafts throughout the house. Of course you need lots and lots of raita to counter all that spice. The desserts usually Gulab Jamun, Semiya Kheer or fruit custard.""The Tamil Christian community in the twin cities has the unique distinction of merging so seamlessly with the communities around them, that their cuisine is an interesting amalgamation of many flavours. As Victor Amalraj, former Indian footballer puts it, ""A majority of us from the Tamil Christian community are based in and around Mettuguda, Lalaguda, Marredpally, Trimulgherry and Yapral. These are areas where many Anglo Indians live too. So our food is heavily influenced by them. Our Christmas dinner menu at home for instance has meat ball curry, yellow rice and duck roast. Some families also make a spicy naatu kodi curry or even a vanjram fish curry.""But the newer generation of Tamil Christians prefer their Christmas food a bit more Hyderabadi. ""We prefer the tried and tested mutton or chicken biryani with mutton curry. And while, the main meal is quite heavy, it's the desserts that steal the show. We make something called the sweet puff stuffed with coconut and sugar, rose cookies and dessert is usually fruit custard,"" says Emmanuel George, an HR professional from Safilguda.For Malayali Christians , who take pride in being one of the oldest Christian communities in the country, every Christmas meal is a feast to look forward to. Mini Joseph, a homemaker from Alwal says, ""The feasting begins at breakfast. Piping hot Kallappams or Palappams served along with mildly flavoured vegetable, beef or chicken stew is the highlight of the breakfast table. The appams also go well with Meen Moilee, a fish curry made with coconut milk."" The lunch is when the heavy weight dishes make an entry. ""Never mind what our staple food is the rest of the year, when it comes to special occasions we Malayalis have to have the boiled red rice. It just reminds us of what we'd eat in Kerala. The rice is served along with the tangy-spicy Kerala fish curry, Chicken Varatharachathu, egg roast and beef fry. Some families even make Meen Pollichathu (pearl spot fish fry). And after that heavy meal, we still save some space for the Semiya Payasam and Vattayappam (a sweet, rice cake with a topping of raisins and cashew nuts) to round off the hearty meal,"" adds Mini.When it comes to Goan Christians , Christmas lunch is a throwback to their Portuguese roots. And, it is one hearty party! Yvette Vaz Sharma, a homemaker from Trimulgherry says, ""We Goans make so many varieties of food for Christmas lunch, that there is not an inch of space left on the table. Beef is the most loved meat, so we make beef fry, beef cutlets and croquettes. And then you have those quintessentially Portugese-inspired dishes like the Chicken Xacuti, Pork Vindaloo and Pork Sorpotel that go well with vegetable or prawn pulao,"" says Yvette. And no Goan meal is complete without sea food. ""The very famous Goan fish curry and fish cutlets made using King Fish, Pomfret or Salmon are a rage on the dining table. The meal is a loud affair, like a party almost, with port wine flowing free. For desserts, it is caramel pudding or fruit custard,"" shares Yvette.For the very small community of Christians from the various North Eastern states, Christmas meal is a time for community bonding. The festival brings together folk from the same state to prepare a common meal. ""A Christmas meal is quite different for us. It's more about the act of sharing a meal together and bonding rather than the dishes themselves. So there aren't any special Christmas dishes as such,"" explains Sam Khumanthem, an entrepreneur living in Marredpally.""There are many tribes in the North Eastern states. Manipur, where I hail from, alone has about 18 different tribes and each one of them has its own unique cuisine and cooking styles. But almost every tribe swears by the duck curry and steamed rice combination. It's quite different from the curries you find in the rest of India because we don't use any masalas at all, except for roasted chilli powder. Manipuris also relish the Eromba chutney that we use as a side dish. It's a mix of different vegetables boiled and mashed into a semi solid form and flavoured with dry fish. Some people even make beef curry or smoked pork curry. When it comes to desserts, we go the traditional way. Our sweets are mostly jaggery base, like the Kabok, which also has peanuts in it,"" says Sam.When it is time for a feast, mutton has to be on the menu for UP folk. And Christmas time is no different. ""There's nothing like having Lucknowi chicken pulao and Lucknowi mutton curry. When we invite people over for a Christmas meal, they usually find our mutton curry very different. The secret is that our curry is made using mustard oil,"" says Ujjwala Samuel, a homemaker who lives in Karkhana. ""There's another special dish that not many make these days, but it was quite the Christmas special. Mutton is marinated for over a week with lemon, spices and garam masala and then deep fried. It's so tasty that you can snack on it all day. The desserts are heavy too. Khadu Ka Kheer is the favourite, but the kids also love the Gujiyas which are stuffed with khova and dry fruits,"" says Ujjwala.Bengalis have a great reputation for their skill with the ladle, and it is gloriously displayed on every bodo din (big day); Christmas is no different. ""The preparations begin a day in advance as we Bengalis prepare our sweet dish called the Khejur Gurer Payesh (date kheer) so that it's nice and cold for the next day. It's made from jaggery, dates, dry fruits and rice, and can get any Bengali excited,"" says Madhusudan Das, a lecturer who lives in Jeedimetla, adding, ""The next day we prepare matar pulao and mutton curry which is mildly flavoured and not very spicy like the Hyderabadi version. And then comes the iconic side dish  tomato sweet chutney made from dates, mango pulp and raisins. The sweets that follow are as important as the main mean itself. Sandesh and Coconut Barfi are the all-time favourites, and some even make flavoured sweet curd.""","they may be united in faith, but when it comes to the cultural aspects of christmas, christians from every state of india add their own unique flavour to the celebrations. and this diversity is best reflected in what's cooking in the kitchens and what's served on the tables on christmas day. and hyderabad, a melting pot of myriad cultures, is where you will get to see some of the best of christmas feasts from across the country being dished out, come sunday. hyderabad times goes on pre-christmas gastronomic tour to see what's on the menu. and what we discovered has already left us craving for christmas, literally!in many anglo indian homes christmas seems like a month-long affair, what with the rose cookies and kulkuls being made, the cake mix getting ready, and homemade wine being bottled. but the real deal, according to chris brown, a hospitality executive, is christmas dinner.

""we prefer the tried and tested mutton or chicken biryani with mutton curry. and while, the main meal is quite heavy, it's the desserts that steal the show. we make something called the sweet puff stuffed with coconut and sugar, rose cookies and dessert is usually fruit custard,"" says emmanuel george, an hr professional from safilguda.for malayali christians , who take pride in being one of the oldest christian communities in the country, every christmas meal is a feast to look forward to. mini joseph, a homemaker from alwal says, ""the feasting begins at breakfast. piping hot kallappams or palappams served along with mildly flavoured vegetable, beef or chicken stew is the highlight of the breakfast table. the appams also go well with meen moilee, a fish curry made with coconut milk."" the lunch is when the heavy weight dishes make an entry. ""never mind what our staple food is the rest of the year, when it comes to special occasions we malayalis have to have the boiled red rice. it just reminds us of what we'd eat in kerala. the rice is served along with the tangy-spicy kerala fish curry, chicken varatharachathu, egg roast and beef fry. some families even make meen pollichathu (pearl spot fish fry). and after that heavy meal, we still save some space for the semiya payasam and vattayappam (a sweet, rice cake with a topping of raisins and cashew nuts) to round off the hearty meal,"" adds mini.when it comes to goan christians , christmas lunch is a throwback to their portuguese roots. and, it is one hearty party! yvette vaz sharma, a homemaker from trimulgherry says, ""we goans make so many varieties of food for christmas lunch, that there is not an inch of space left on the table. beef is the most loved meat, so we make beef fry, beef cutlets and croquettes. and then you have those quintessentially portugese-inspired dishes like the chicken xacuti, pork vindaloo and pork sorpotel that go well with vegetable or prawn pulao,"" says yvette. and no goan meal is complete without sea food. ""the very famous goan fish curry and fish cutlets made using king fish, pomfret or salmon are a rage on the dining table. the meal is a loud affair, like a party almost, with port wine flowing free. for desserts, it is caramel pudding or fruit custard,"" shares yvette.for the very small community of christians from the various north eastern states, christmas meal is a time for community bonding. the festival brings together folk from the same state to prepare a common meal. ""a christmas meal is quite different for us. it's more about the act of sharing a meal together and bonding rather than the dishes themselves. so there aren't any special christmas dishes as such,"" explains sam khumanthem, an entrepreneur living in marredpally.""there are many tribes in the north eastern states. manipur, where i hail from, alone has about 18 different tribes and each one of them has its own unique cuisine and cooking styles. but almost every tribe swears by the duck curry and steamed rice combination. it's quite different from the curries you find in the rest of india because we don't use any masalas at all, except for roasted chilli powder. manipuris also relish the eromba chutney that we use as a side dish. it's a mix of different vegetables boiled and mashed into a semi solid form and flavoured with dry fish. some people even make beef curry or smoked pork curry. when it comes to desserts, we go the traditional way. our sweets are mostly jaggery base, like the kabok, which also has peanuts in it,"" says sam.when it is time for a feast, mutton has to be on the menu for up folk. and christmas time is no different. ""there's nothing like having lucknowi chicken pulao and lucknowi mutton curry. when we invite people over for a christmas meal, they usually find our mutton curry very different. the secret is that our curry is made using mustard oil,"" says ujjwala samuel, a homemaker who lives in karkhana. ""there's another special dish that not many make these days, but it was quite the christmas special. mutton is marinated for over a week with lemon, spices and garam masala and then deep fried. it's so tasty that you can snack on it all day. the desserts are heavy too. khadu ka kheer is the favourite, but the kids also love the gujiyas which are stuffed with khova and dry fruits,"" says ujjwala.bengalis have a great reputation for their skill with the ladle, and it is gloriously displayed on every bodo din (big day); christmas is no different. ""the preparations begin a day in advance as we bengalis prepare our sweet dish called the khejur gurer payesh (date kheer) so that it's nice and cold for the next day. it's made from jaggery, dates, dry fruits and rice, and can get any bengali excited,"" says madhusudan das, a lecturer who lives in jeedimetla, adding, ""the next day we prepare matar pulao and mutton curry which is mildly flavoured and not very spicy like the hyderabadi version. and then comes the iconic side dish  tomato sweet chutney made from dates, mango pulp and raisins. the sweets that follow are as important as the main mean itself. sandesh and coconut barfi are the all-time favourites, and some even make flavoured sweet curd."""

Locals do not like to talk about this, but following the womans rescue, the administration in the regions Shillai area, about 240 km from Shimla, conducted a survey to assess the exodus.The survey conducted across 140 villages revealed that in the last decade nearly 1,100 women from Shillai had married men in Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, said Vikas Shukla, sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), Shillai.The report was shocking. A majority of the women were enticed for marriage with the promise of better life, said Shukla. Not all the grooms were youth. He said the Union minister for women and child development, Maneka Gandhi, had sought information on this disturbing trend.Several instances of migrated brides being sent back home, allegedly after facing mental and physical abuse, have caught the administrations eye. Many of these marriages are not registered and solemnised with the chunni-odhna tradition in which a bride and groom tie the knot under a sheet, according to a government official who did not want to be named.Not all women who marry outside are abducted, but the survey has found the enticement is money, a big draw in the region where jobs are few and crop activities are limited to ginger and tomato. Many people from this region make up the workforce in various unorganised sectors across the state. It is generally known that people who come bride hunting either pay her family or purchase land for them. None of the people involved speaks about it, said the government official.Pratap Singh Tomar, convener of the Central Haati Committee, an organisation seeking Scheduled Tribe status for nearly 250,000 people in the trans-Giri region, said, Not all the girls marry for money. They also look for better life. There is so much hardship here. The people in trans-Giri region make up nearly half the population in Sirmaur district.Surinder Rana, head of Millah panchayat in the region, said, We have heard about some families marrying their girls outside for money. I have been trying to discourage this.Incidentally, there have been reports of girls and women of the region being trafficked on the pretext of marriage. Sirmaur police busted an interstate racket two years ago. Three men from Haryana were arrested. Girls had been taken to Haryana on the pretext of finding a match, said Zahur Zaidi, inspector general of police (Law and Order).The survey in Shillai has put the spotlight on the cross-regional migration of brides. Anuradha Thakur, secretary of the states women child welfare department said officials had contacted the Shillai SDM, and the social welfare department was conducting an independent inquiry.

The state government has written to potato-deficit states like Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, telling them they can procure potato from UP, horticulture director SP Joshi said.Joshi also blamed farmers, saying they erred in anticipating the price. Potato was selling for Rs 1,500 per quintal till July-August but most farmers chose to sit on the stock, guessing the price will go up further. That did not happen and a new crop of potato from within and outside the state also arrived, compounding the price situation, he explained.

Here is the complete transcript of thewith Arnab Goswami.Prime Minister Modi thank you very much for this interview. Thank you very muchMy greetings to all the peopleThis is your first one to one interview to a private news channel since you became Prime Minister. And if I am not mistaken, this is the first ever interview by a sitting Prime Minister of India to a private television news channel in the country. So I would first like to thank you and am very grateful for the opportunity.The world of the media has grown so big that everybody has to attach themselves with it.I am very grateful and our viewers will be very grateful also Mr Modi because they want to hear your views on a range of subjects. Mr Prime Minister I would like to start by taking you back to 20th May 2014. The results came on May 16th. Four days later, you gave a historic speech in the Central Hall of Parliament and you were speaking to the members of Parliament. You had said four days after the results that an era of responsibility has begun. And that you said that in 2019 before the elections, I will come back to this Parliament, I will come back to the MPs and I will give my report card. Forty percent into your tenure, how much have you achieved of your own targets?When I went for the first time as an MP to the Central Hall, and it was the first time I was seeing the Central Hall. I had not been there before. So I had then said that becoming the Prime Minister was not about the designation of the office but it was about the responsibilities and work of being a PM. I had also said that my government would be committed to the poor. I was completely new in the job. Delhi was new for me. The Delhi environment was new to me. The work of the government of India was also new for me. But despite that, in such a short time, the pace at which the country has moved forward, and it's not on one subject. You can pick up any aspect of the government's functioning, and if you make a comparison with the past governments, then you will realize that no issue has been ignored. There has been an effort to bring in something new in every area. There is an effort to bring in change in every area. One big challenge was that I was not experienced about this place, I had not even been an MP. The office was new, the questions were also new. But when I look at the second biggest challenge, we should remember those days when the country was engulfed in disappointment. The everyday news was about whether there would be any electricity production after seven days, whether coal would be supplied or not. This was the situation then. The entire system was engulfed in disappointment. The big challenge was to inject new trust into the system and create confidence among the citizens. It is very difficult to evaluate this from the outside but I have gone through it. But today I can say with a lot of satisfaction that now there is no trace of any disappointment. The intention to do something is visible. And it's not in words but in actual achievement. I had said that within a given timeframe, we will open bank accounts for the poor. For something that had not been done for 60 years, setting a timeframe for it was in itself a risk. But because of that a trust was created in the system that it was something doable. So that's the process I started for awakening the confidence. And today you can see that in every sector, the changed circumstances can be seen. While evaluating the performance of this government, never forget that you will have to make that evaluation in comparison with the 10 years of the previous government. Only then will you know where we were and where we are now. We should not be talking about what we are aiming for. For now you will have to assess the present in comparison with the immediate past and in that you will find a bright futureMr. Modi, I want to start now on the issue of foreign policy. In the area of foreign policy, you have taken great personal interest. The amount of personal interest you have shown in foreign policy, probably none of the previous Prime Ministers showed the same kind of interest. Your approach is pro active. What I find interesting about your foreign policy is that you have balanced different powers and different interests. On the one side, your relationship with US, you made sure that India enters the Missile Control Technology Regime with them. A week before that you also signed the historic Chabahar Port Agreement with Iran. So, you have balanced very diverse forces. My question to you over this is that, is it easy to do that as an Indian Prime Minister? Secondly, on the issue of the NSG, you staked a lot of personal interest, personal push, you lobbied actively. How close are we to getting the NSG seat?Firstly, about foreign policy, you need to know what has strengthened our foreign policy. For 30 years, in our country, the government was unstable. For 30 years, party with a clear mandate wasn't given the opportunity to form the government. The world measures the government of a nation on the basis of its condition in its own country, on how strong their word is in their own country. I am thankful to the people of this country, that after 30 years, they chose a government with absolute majority and this has had an impact on world politics. Countries and world leaders have changed their perspective towards India. This is the biggest benefit. Secondly, the world didn't know me. The world wants to know who the head of the state is. If someone would want to know Modi through the eyes of the media, then he would be disillusioned on which modi is the real Modi. If this happens, the country will be at a loss. Modi's personality shouldn't be a hindrance for the world to have faith in india. But for that unless I meet all those leaders and engage them them one to one, unless I speak to them frankly, they wouldn't know about india's head of state, so it was very important for me as I am not from a political family. I never had the opportunity to meet the world leaders earlier.You were an unknown entity in foreign policyMore than foreign policy it was foreign relations. Yes, I was new to it. So for me, being pro active was mandatory. Thirdly, we work as a team. Foreign ministry, Prime Minister's officer, commerce ministry, finance ministry, defense minister, everyone works as a team, not as separate pieces. The impact that is now visible, is not just because of Modi, it is because of the team. All teams work in a particular direction. That is why the impact is seen, earlier these teams were splintered. We have seen instances where the party would give a statement, the prime minister would say something else, party leaders would say something else. This disunity has had a negative impact. Thirdly, we also need to understand that earlier the world was bi polar. Foreign policy would be centered around two super powers. India was a little late in realizing that this bi polar situation was for namesake. Now the entire world, in changed circumstances, especially in 21st century, it is more interdependent and inter connected, earlier, the foreign policy was possible between governments, but today it is not possible just between governments. Government relations are important but increasing people to people contact is equally important. There's been a shift in paradigm. Because I do not have any previous baggage, because I've had a clean slate, I write everything from beginning and that has a benefit. Today we are building relations with countries across the world. The amount of respect with which I engage saudi arabia, I engage Iran with the same amount of respect. The amount of respect with which I speak to America, I speak to russia with the same amount of respect. So we need to understand this. We also need to understand that we shouldn't consider smaller countries insignificant. I abide by this principle. The small countries of the world are as important as the big nations. We had assumed that the relations with smaller nations would develop under the shadow of the bigger nations. I brought about a change in this. You must have seen that I made a forum for the pacific island nations. We have had two meetings. I went there once and they came here once. These are small countries with a population of about 10 lakh or 20 lakh. But these small island nations are most affected by global warming. When india took up the international solar mission and 122 nations joined it, the island nations benefitted the most out of it. They are 50 in number now. A group of 50 nations, feels secured with this vision of India. If we try to understand this change, then we would realize that in the world, a few days back, I was sitting with the officers of our foreign services, so as we got talking, in a very poetic way I told them that there was a time when we used to sit by the sea and count the waves, but the time has now changed, we are done counting waves, now it's time for us to steer ourselves, ride the waves and decide on our direction, destination and speedThat is apparent. You have a very aggressive foreign policy. But my second question was, you put so much effort for NSG membership. My question was, how close are we to NSG membership and were you disappointed that we did not make it at the very end because of China's opposition?Look the first thing is that India has been continuously making these efforts, no matter which government was in office. Be it the membership of the UN Security Council or the SCO membership or MTCR membership or NSG membership. Every government has made an effort. It's not that only this government is trying, it's in continuity. But it's during our tenure that we achieved SCO membership, we also got the MTCR membership. I have full faith that now we have begun a coordinated effort for the NSG membership too. The process has begun on a positive note. Everything has rules and will work accordingly and move forwardIs it the problem of mindset with China? There have been 13 engagements at various levels between the Narendra Modi government and the Chinese government. The latest engagement was when you went to Tashkent. You spent some time with the Chinese President Xi Jinping. Yet it was seen that in the case of Masood Azhar, China blocked India's UN bid to ban him. Now they have stalled India's NSG bid. Why is China repeatedly blocking us Mr Prime Minister despite your personal proactive measures and your government's outreach?The first thing is that we have an ongoing dialogue with China and it should continue to happen. In foreign policy it's not necessary to have similar views to have a conversation. Even when the views are contradictory, talks are the only way forward and problems should be resolved through dialogue. We don't have one problem with China, we have a whole lot of problems pending with China. Slowly and steadily, an effort is on to address these issues through talks and make them less cumbersome. I can say that China has been cooperating with India to search for solutions. On some issues, it's a question of principles for them. On some issues, it's a question of principles for us. On some issues they differ with us and there are issues on which we differ with them. There are some basic differences. But the most important thing is that we can speak to China eye-to-eye and put forth India's interests in the most unambiguous manner. We are a government that takes care of India's interests. We don't compromise on this. Three days ago I met the Chinese President. I told him clearly about India's interests. They are a different country, we are a different countryDo you think you will be able to change their mindset on the issue of NSG membership?See the foreign policy is not about changing mindsets. Foreign policy is about finding the common meeting points. Where do our interests converge and how much? We have to sit and talk with every country. It's our ongoing effortThis statement that you just made is also apt in the context of America where you gave a speech in the U.S Congress. By the way Mr Prime Minister it was a fantastic speechThank youThere was a lot of humour. You were laughing and cracking jokes while you delivered the speech which was very unique. They also appreciated it. Was the speech impromptu?I have a humourous side but these days humour can be a risky thingWhy do you say that?In this era of 24/7 news channels, anybody can lift a small word and make a big issue out of it. But I will tell you the truth, the reason for the absence of humour in public life is this fear. I am myself scared . Earlier when I used to make speeches, I would make it so humourous but there would never be any issuesHave you become more conscious now?I am not conscious. I am in fear, there is no humour left in public life because of this fear. Everyone is scared. I am in fear. My speeches used be humourous. I see it in Parliament, that humour is finished there too. It is a matter of concern. I will quote one proverb.Yes, go ahead.Even if you mention a proverb, they will connect it with something else and begin a conversation. The one who is saying the proverb does not know for what he is speaking.But you should not lose your sense of humour Mr Prime MinisterBut it is true that my trip to the United States of America, my speech in their Congress and the respect shown towards India created a lot of hype. Had it not been hyped so much, there would not have been so much criticism on the NSG issue. Government is being criticized not for any mishandling of the NSG issue but because we were so successful over there (in the USA)Did China become conscious of your growing friendship with US?I am talking about what's happening hereBut when you delivered that speech in context of America, you used a very interesting phrase. You said 'We have to overcome the hesitations of history'. My Hindi is not that good. Like hesitations of history. But my question to you is Mr Prime Minister, how close can we get to America because many Indians believe that America is still supporting Pakistan, giving them military assistance. How close can we get? At what point do we stop before we are seen like an American ally? What is your own world view on that?I would especially like to appeal to my country's media that we should stop looking at everything in India from the. India is an independent country. It is a country of 125 crore people. Whenever it approaches any country, it will only be concerned about its own interests. It has been our biggest shortcoming and mistake that we have been tagging ourselves with another country and trying to do things. We are an independent country, we have our own policies and future. We have to think about the future of our 125 crore people. There should be no compromise on our interests. We have relations with America in the context of these fundamental pointsHow close can we get to them?There has been warmth in our relationship. You must have seen the editorials in American newspapers after my visit to that country. One point mentioned in those editorials was that the success of Obama's foreign policy has been the warm relationship with India. This has been saidWhat you are saying Modiji is that we can be close to America but we need not be an ally or seen to be an ally?The first thing is that we no longer live in a bipolar world. The world is interconnected and interdependent. You will have to connect with everybody at the same time. Even if there are two opposing countries, they will have to be friends. Now the times have changedMr Modi, on 8th May 2014, I had the opportunity to interview you, the interview took place in Ahmedabad, I think one last phase of elections was left. We were discussing the issue of Pakistan. You have had an uncompromising approach towards Pakistan. Two days back, Lashkar E Toiba killed 8 CRPF jawans in an attack. In the 8th May interview, you put forth a very interesting phrase, you said 'Can talks be heard amidst the noise of bombs, guns and pistols?' This is how you had phrased it. Do you believe we have been too generous towards Pakistan? Do you believe we have been too generous towards Pakistan?There are two things. One - India has always wanted friendly ties with its neighbours, there can be no debate around it. We want to live in harmony and peace. And I have said it repeatedly, that India has to fight poverty, Pakistan too has to fight poverty, why don't we come together to fight poverty? I said this before elections and during election campaigns. Also I had invited leaders of SAARC nations to my swearing in ceremony and they had attended it as well. So there has been no change in our intent, our thoughts and our current behaviour. Number two - those who have to work from the table, will work from the table and those who have to work at the border, will work at border with full strength. Each one will fulfill the responsibility entrusted to them. And our jawans are fulfilling their responsibilities. It's true that pressure on terrorists has increased, their schemes are proving unsuccessful. The intent with which they move forward are foiled and they have to face major challenges. It is because of this disappointment that such incidents are taking place and our jawans are risking their lives and protecting the country. We are very proud of our JawansWhen your foreign policy is studied, observers analyze what's happening and what's not happening. If you give me the opportunity, I want to do a bit of analyses. There was a terrific pace of engagement with Pakistan between October, November and December. On 30th November, you met Nawaz Sharif on the sidelines (of UN Climate Summit in Paris). Both of you were seated on a sofa, talking to each other. A lot of people were speculating the contents of your conversation. This was on the sidelines of Climate Summit. After that, all of a sudden within seven days there were NSA level talks and Ajit Doval spoke to Nasir Janjua in Bangkok. And again after that you went to Russia via Afghanistan, you made an unexpected visit to Nawaz Sharif in Lahore. It was a personal trip but it still had some level of importance. Eight days later, Pakistani terrorists attacked Pathankot. Can you tell our viewers whether Pakistan was proactively responding in the months of October, November and December? Did the Pathankot terror attack change the situation? Is it true that Pakistan was making a lot of movement in those three months?Look there are different types of forces operating in Pakistan. But the government only engages with a democratically elected system. Our effort for that engagement is continuing. But our supreme objective is peace. Our supreme objective is to protect India's interests. We keep making effort toward that objective and sometimes our efforts are successful. As far as meetings and talks are concerned, we signalled right from the day I took oath and sent invitations for the oath taking ceremony, that we seek friendly relations but without compromising on our interests. And that is why I have said that my country's soldiers have full freedom to answer back in whatever manner they have to and they will keep doing thatMr Prime Minister what is the 'Lakshman Rekha' that you would draw when it comes to Pakistan. There is some confusion surrounding this subject. I would like you to give an elaborate reply. In 2014, it was believed that if talks are being held, then they should be held between two countries and not with Hurriyat. It should be between the government of India and the government of Pakistan. The other 'Lakshman Rekha' is that you must act on 26/11. There's been no forward movement so far. The third thing is about forward movement on the Pathankot attack case. So what is the 'Lakshman Rekha' now and if Pakistan remains within those bounds, so talks can happen at the political level or at any other level?The first thing is that with Pakistan, to whom do we talk to decide about the 'Lakshman Rekha'. Will it be with the elected government or with other actors? That is why India will have to be on alert all the time. India will have to be alert every moment. There can never be any laxity in this. But there is an outcome due to my continuous efforts like my visit to Lahore and my invitation to the Pakistani Prime Minister to come to India. Now I don't have to explain to the world about India's position. The world is unanimously appreciating India's position. And the world is seeing that Pakistan is finding it difficult to respond. If we had become an obstacle, then we would have had to explain to the world that we are not that obstacle. Now we don't have to explain to the world. The world knows our intentions. Like on the issue of terrorism, the world never bought India's theory on terrorism. They would sometime dismiss it by saying that it's your law and order problem. Today the world has to accept what India has been saying about terrorism. India's dialogue on terrorism, the losses India has suffered due to terrorism, the losses suffered by humanity, the world is now acknowledging that. So I believe we have to take this process forwardMr Prime Minister I now want to move to questions on the economy. In the past two years you have started many schemes. If we look at the theme of Jan Dhan Yojna for financial inclusion, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna for crop insurance, Swach Bharat, Skill India, Make In India. If we see the theme running through these schemes, is your social agenda at the core of your personal economic philosophy, social transformation? Is the social agenda at the core of your economic philosophy as the Prime Minister?The first point is our philosophy is to reach the last man in the line. Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay's philosophy forms the core of our political, economic and social ideology. And even Mahatma Gandhi used to say that what is there for the last man? So my development parameter is very simple. It is about how the poorest of the poor can benefit from development. The poor is the central focus of my economic agenda. The poor should be strengthened in such a way that they get the willingness to defeat poverty. By helping the poor make ends meet while they remain in poverty is also one of the ways. I am not saying right or wrong but it's one of the ways. But today the country's situation is such that we should make the poor strong so that they become partners in defeating poverty. All these schemes are meant to empower the poor and change the quality of life. The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna is not only about opening bank accounts for the poor. Because of this the poor are feeling that they are becoming a part of the country's economic system. The bank that he was seeing from afar, now he is able to enter that bank. This brings about a psychological transformation. Looked at in another way, did you ever imagine that 40 thousand crores could be injected into the banking system by contributions from the poor. The poor who never had bank accounts, have deposited 100 rupees, 50 rupees or 200 rupees. It means that poor man saved 100 rupees and the change began in his life. We have taken up construction of toilets. I had gone to Chhattisgarh and had the opportunity to get the blessings of one mother. An adivasi mother heard about the scheme for building toilets. She sold her four goats and built a toilet. That 90 old mother uses a walking stick and goes around the cluster of 30 or 40 houses in the tribal village and has been spreading the message to build toilets. This change is becoming the reason for the change in the quality of life. I have begun the cleanliness campaign. It's estimated an individual spends an average of 7000 rupees for treatment of a disease. The main reason for disease is filth. The poor suffer the most from the filth. If a poor man falls sick, he cannot drive his rickshaw for two days and his children go hungry. So how can we help the poor bring about change in their lives? Now there is a neo-middle class and a middle class in the country. The young have their aspirations. So another aspect of my policies you must have seen are the Start Up India, Stand Up India, Seaport activity, port activity, railways expansion, railway station upgradation. These changes directly appeal to the middle class. The middle class has its aspirations. We have to create jobs? How will job creation happen? Till I invest in the development of infrastructure, there be no job creation. You must have seen that the maximum electricity generation since Independence has occurred this year. The maximum amount of coal mined has been in this year. The maximum length of roads being constructed daily is happening in this year. The fastest loading and unloading of steamers at sea ports is happening now. All these changes are creating opportunities for employment like in Start up India, Stand Up India. For instance in Stand Up India, I have said that every bank should give an economic opportunity to one woman, one dalit or one tribal person to become entrepreneurs. This will create many job opportunities. So this is the basis of my economic philosophy.Mr Prime Minister if I could interrupt you on this. On the one hand is the people's expectations and on the other is your vision. Many programs that you have mentioned, you can't put a calendar date to it but they don't have an immediate impact. They maybe able to show results in 3, 4, 5 maybe beyond 5 years. Now there are challenges in that. Mr Prime Minister, you are aware more than anyone else that people want immediate results. Now you spoke of job creation. The first thing, as an achievement you have managed to grow the economy at 7.5 per cent when the global economic climate is very bleak. You have spoken about it as well. You have met fiscal deficit targets, FDI inflows have increased but people are saying that job opportunities are not increasing. You have spoken about infrastructure but the current rate of unemployment. Mr Prime Minister, the latest Labour Bureau figures, is it a source of concern for you as the Prime Minister?The first thing is that are 800 million people below the age of 35 in our country. We have to accept that the demand for jobs is very high. But where will they get employment? Investment will come in. It will be used in the infrastructure sector, manufacturing and services sector. Now like the initiative we have taken, we have started the Mudra Yojna. More than three crore people in the country comprise washermen, barbers, milkman, newspaper vendors, cart vendors. We have given them nearly 1.25 lakh crore rupees without any guarantee. Now why have these people taken the money? To expand their work. When he expands his work, if he is currently employing one person, now he has to employ two people. If there were two employed earlier, now there are three. Now just think, when 3 crore of these small businesses have got access to finance, they must have expanded their work. Now all this is not in the Labour Department's registration. Three crore people have expanded their work. We took another small decision. The big malls in the country run 365 days a year but the smaller shops have to close on holidays. We announced in the Budget that even a small shopkeeper can operate his shop till late night and that too on all the seven days of the week. If the malls don't have restrictions then why should the small shopkeepers have restrictions. So now if a shopkeeper operates his shop till late and on all seven days, if he earlier employed one person, now he will have to employ two people. So won't the employment increase?So is your focus on entrepreneurship?Our focus is on all aspects. Now we are saying that by 2022 we want to ensure that everyone has a house. Housing sector has the maximum potential for creating employment. Houses will be built in such huge numbers, how many people will get employment? You must have seen that last year we brought in a textile policy. Under this textile policy, there will be income tax benefits for those who create employment. The more employment one creates, the more tax benefits they will get. For the first time, employment generation and tax has been linked. These are the things that boost employment and our central focus is creating employment for the ordinary citizenMr Prime Minister, questions are also being raised on food inflation which has still not decreased. The expectation was that the food inflation would decline. The people had put their hopes on the Prime Minister that you will bring down prices. This not only has a political impact but also has a social impact. Over the past two weeks, there were reports that in some places the price of Arhar dal had touched 150 rupees and 200 rupees for other pulses. The price of tomatoes was also rising. Is this only seasonal because the food inflation is increasing at 7.5 per cent year on year. Global oil prices have fallen. Do you think this creates perception issues for your government?You can't view inflation as a perception issue. Price rise should be seen as a reality. What is available for a consumer should be seen for what it is. There should never be an attempt to view price rise as a perception issue as a means of escaping the reality of price rise. We will have to accept reality. You see the fast pace at which prices were rising under the previous government, today that speed has decelerated a lot. You can see the statistics, you will find it there. Second, the country has gone through two consecutive years of severe drought. Drought has a direct impact on the price of vegetables, food and pulses because all these things are produced from the soil. Now when there is such a big drought, it's not in anybody's hands. The second option in such a situation is imports. The Indian government has imported pulses in huge quantities. Third, it is the joint responsibility of the state and Central governments. It is not exclusively the state's responsibility. It is not exclusively the Centre's responsibility. It is the joint responsibility of both the state and Central governments. This should not be an issue of blame game that the state government did not do certain things and that the Centre did not do certain things. But it will have to be agreed that it is the joint responsibility of both. That is why the Centre has given rights to the states to make stringent laws. How much stocks to keep or not to keep are decisions which the states can take. All these rights have been given to the states. Some states have performed well, some states are trying. But the Centre and state governments are trying to work together on this. I believe that we have been successful to the extent that the speed with which prices were rising (under UPA), what would have happened if the prices were to rise at that speed. We have been successful in stopping that speedy rise of prices. But as far as pulses are concerned, production in India has been very low. Many farmers who were earlier sowing pulses have started cultivating sugar. That is also an area of concern. We gave special incentives for pulses. We have tried to set up a different MSP for pulses. We have taken steps to procure pulses from farmers with bonus. Our focus is on increasing the production of pulses. We are also focusing on building stocks of pulses by importing from abroad. An all out effort is being made and I believe that nobody doubts the sincerity of this governmentMr Prime Minister what is your view about the controversy around the exit of Raghuram Rajan as the RBI Governor? A lot has been spoken about this. There was commentary that it may effect India's image, perception as a global economy. What's your own view of the controversy around the exit of Raghuram Rajan?When my Government was formed in May 2014, you take newspapers from May, June, July 2014 and check television debates during that period. The topic of the television debates would be - Will the new govt let Raghuram Rajan continue? Or Will the new Government oust Raghuram Rajan? And there was more or less consensus that he was appointed by the previous govt and so Modi won't let him complete his tenure and will remove him. You have seen, that he worked his entire tenure. For the time he was appointed by the previous government, he completing his entire term. So all the misconceptions have been dispelled. Secondly, according to my 2 year experience in Govt, those who are creating controversies, are being unjust to Raghuram RajanWhy so?I will tell you. Those who say...I believe Raghuram Rajan's patriotism is no less than any of ours. It will be doing injustice to him if one says that he will serve the country only if he is at a particular post. As much as I know Raghuram Rajan, whatever post he holds, wherever he is, he is someone who will continue to serve the country. He is someone who loves his country. Therefore, it's not like the nation won't get Raghuram Rajan's services, Raghuram Rajan is not that kind of a person. He is a person who loves the country. Those who speak such language are doing great injustice to him. My experience with him has been good.I appreciate the work he has done. And my good wishes will always be with himPrime Minister Modi, there's a question related to this. During your speech at the Executive you used seven words begining with letter 'S'-- 'Sevabhaav' (service), 'Santulan' (balance), 'Sanyam' (restraint), 'Samvaad' (dialogue), 'Samanvay' (coordination), 'Sakaratmak' (positivity) and 'Samvedna' (sensitivity). I will ask the question in context with Raghuram Rajan because you used these words in the speech at National Executive Meet speech on June 14 in Allahabad. You said, 'Our party leaders and party workers should use these qualities in their daily dealings and behaviour.' Prime Minister, in Raghuram Rajan's context, your Rajya Sabha MP has made many comments. Later he made critical remarks against senior bureaucrats. My question is, do you think it is right? When we talk about 'Sanyam' (restraint) and 'Santulan' (balance), is it correct?Whether it is someone from my party or not, I believe that such things are inappropriate. The nation won't benefit from such publicity stunts. One should be more responsible while conducting themselves. Anyone who believes he is bigger than the system is wrong.That's a very clear message.I have a very clear message. I have no two minds about it.And Mr Prime Minister, if I may say so, between May 8 and now, you are speaking as straight as you did before you took over as Prime Minister. I think that answer takes me to the next subject. Mr Prime Minister, the issue is that of Black Money. In a very interersting way you said, prices should not be looked at from the point of percepetion, equally, Mr Prime Minister it can be said said that an issue like Black Money should not be looked at in terms of perception, but it is perception forming. There are political debates on this. Experts say that the Black Money economy has shrunk, 10-15% economy has shrunk through land dealings and other things. You have passed the Black Money Bill, you have made taxation more transparent, you have started information sharing with other countries, you have taken steps, but Prime Minister Modi, people still expect that a Rs 25 lakh crores will be brought back and put into their bank accounts. How will you address that expectation? The hope that people have taking Black Money, how will you address it?How did the black money issue arise and how did it become such a serious issue? We have to look at the background. It is an established fact in the minds of the common man those who steal money park their money overseas. It's a common perception. Even if I look at it from the common man's perspective, I also wonder where does this money go? This issue was always stalled in the Parliament. When the matter reached the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court ordered Special Investigation Team to look into it, even then the previous government stalled it for three years, from 2011-2014. It's after this that political parties, the media and the common man started believing that there's something wrong. Then the issue of Black Money became an agenda. Even today I can say...that yes, when there is money stashed in foreign accounts, there are some norms of engagement with foreign countries on the issue. But between 2011-2014, these people were given the opportunity to launder money here and thereAnd you also said on 17 February 2015 on this issue, that the then Law Minister is only offering lip serviceThe result was that people got several chances to launder money. Secondly, after our Government was formed, the first decision taken by our Cabinet was to form a Special Investigation Team to bring back Black Money which was pending despite Supreme Court's 2011 order. This shows our sincerity. From then on, you can't imagine how stringent the laws have been made to bring back Black Money and whoever comes in its fold will know how strict the law is. Thirdly, I attended the G20 Summit. Never was Black Money issue discussed in the G20 forum. It was my first G20 summit, for the first time I met the world leaders. And for the first time in the G20 Summit, one paragraph was on unaccounted money, on black money and 20 countries said that the world should cooperateBlack. The dirty money, black money was also linked to terrorism, an environment of global census was created. We have been signing agreements one after the other with different countries that there will be real time, automatic exchange of information with India. I recently visited Switzerland and there was minimal discussion on the issue. But after I returned, a big delegation from Switzerland visited India, and they held meeting with the Indian Government and we discussed...for several years, we believed that Switzerland is the place where black money is stashed, that country is holding discussions to come to a consensus on Automatic Information Exchange and if we reach consensus it will be a great achievement. Thirdly you must've seen that Mauritius route came up in almost everything. It was said that money goes out of India and returns through the Mauritius route. This was discussed. Everyone thought that nothing can be done about the Mauritius route.But our Government held a dialogue with the Mauritius Government, made changes to the old treaty. And we successfully made a new treaty to block the money which comes through the Mauritius route and very soon it will be phased out and completed. All these decisions are taken to fight the Black Money menace. This is not a one sided fight. Secondly, the govt is working in a direction to make sure that Black Money isn't generated in India and black Money doesn't go out of India, you can see the results of all this.When the opposition raises the Rs 15 lakh issue.That is something the opposition raises during elections. Let them have some issue to talk aboutMr Prime Minister, there has been no major financial corruption or scam in your tenure in the last two years. Perception is again, what people say is because you keep a very tight control on the reins of Government but the question is there are people, who are wilful defaulters, the economic offenders who take a lot of money from the country or commit economic offences in the country, go overseas and use rules and use lawyers, and they don't come back to India. And people are asking now, is the Narendra Modi Govt determined to take these cases of wilful defaulters and economic offenders to their logical conclusion.Firstly, this question is not in the minds of people. The people of India have confidence that if there's someone who can do this, it is Narendra Modi and he will do it. Citizens of the country have full faith.Does it worry you, that people have misued the law?I take this as an opportunity and I will show them what the law is.Mr. Modi, there have been several corruption cases about the previous government, which have now come out. There is AgustaWestland, many defense scams and defense transactions are now being analyzed seriously. The cases which were quoted in the CAG reports but were ignored are now coming in the forefront. This question is important because this isn't just about financial corruption but these questions have direct implications on the national security of the country. Do you think, when they say that this is a political witch hunt by Narendra Modi Sarkar, do you think all of these cases would have been possible without political patronage?There are many things which are not visible. One can't imagine the difficulty I am experiencing in taking out things from dirt. One who is working there knows the amount of dirt that exists and how certain things have been caught in a web. There are certain powers behind it. The case about Agusta helicopters. I can't deny it and I believe that we have the right to doubt that people behind this are very experienced. They have perfectly practiced the art of doing wrong deeds. They are very experienced and knowledgeable. And one can also smell the fact that such a thing wouldn't have been done without a shield. Now, agencies are probing. Let's see how far the probe goes. But the investigation shouldn't go ahead while people are being targeted, neither does my government target anyone. The sin has been committed, but how much is done, How was it done, who did it, probe agencies will find out in a professional way. Whatever comes out, will be put outPrime Minister, talking about your speech in the US Congress, and the humour that you displayed. I felt some of it was impromptu. But the Americans were able to relate to what you said, I don't remember the exact words, you said, I am informed that the working of the US Congress is harmonious. And then there was a pause and people were laughing. Then you said, 'I am told' - You emphasized and said 'I am told that you are well known for your bipartisanship.' Then the applause was more. And then you said, 'You are not alone. Time and again I have witnessed a similar spirit in the Indian Parliament.' You spoke about a serious topic in a interesting manner. You referred to the Upper House. There was a lot of response on that too. Your humour was really appreciated and I think it was a wonderful moment when you were speaking. But, Mr. Prime Minister, when you look back at the parliament, this question comes to many people's minds, has Prime Minister Narendra Modi being held back from achieving his own objectives because of the non-stop parliamentary logjam. How much has this affected his moving towards his own targets? If you critically analyze this situation, do you feel your government could have been more consultative or do you feel the blame is entirely with the Opposition?I look at it differently. I believe there have been a lot of problems. Whether the fault is ours or their's, I 'll leave it to the people. People will decide. But because of discussions in Parliament - we may not come to a decision, the decision could be opposing our view, nothing wrong in that. But at least there should be a discussion. The sad part is, if somebody is running away from debate or don't let discussions happen, then it is a cause of worry in a democracy. Whether the government's work is accomplished or not, I don't see it as a cause of worry. If not today, it will happen tomorrow. There are certain things which will happen at an administrative level. The big thing is, Parliament is for discussion. Parliament is to show dissent. Parliament is to give an argument for one's opposition, to present an argument when they support.To uphold this basic spirit of Parliament, is the responsibility of every person who values democracy. It is the responsibility of those present in the Parliament and those outside. It is the responsibility of those in power and those not in power. This is a matter of spirit and it should be followed. As far as the government is concerned, on every issue and at every forum, we have tried to hold discussions. I myself have met the opposition leaders and spoken to them. Key members of the government are also in touch. And you must have seen that many issues have been resolved. In the last session, we have passed 12 bills in Rajya Sabha, we passed 10 bills in the Lok Sabha. So the pace has picked up. When people say 'Opposition', it is unfair to the opposition. There are some parties in the Parliament which are not with the BJP or NDA, but are with the government on key decisions. So, to defame the Opposition by saying that all opposition parties are against us -- when some people do this, it is wrong. There is one party which has problems. And the whole world knows that party. Secondly, to say that 'When you were is Opposition, you did it this way' There is a difference between every Opposition party. 'We have run the government for 60 years and now we are in the Opposition, so we know the nitty-gritties of the government, we know the responsibilities. We can't behave in the way, a new Opposition party behaves.' A party which hasn't been in power or hasn't seen anything, could behave in this way. For example, we are in power now, and consider in 2040 we become the Opposition party. So, in 2040 we can't have the same conduct as the one we had in 2009 or 2010.Congress is a very experienced and old partyThat's why I say that, those who have been in power for so many years, shouldn't be doing this. If there is a new party in the Opposition, they have a small demand for their state or if an MP has a demand for his/her constituency and does something like this, then we can understand. Ones who have been in power for very long, shouldn't be doing such thingsPrime Minister Modi, do you think the GST bill which has been stuck for over one and half years, it is a path-breaking economic reform. It unifies the country. Recently you met Ms Jayalalithaa after she was sworn in as the Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee has extended her support for GST and Congress allies at the state level are supporting the GST bill. Do you feel optimistic that GST bill will be passed in the next session of the Parliament?First we need to understand, that we look at GST only within the purview of an economic reform because of which the right information doesn't come out. Not having GST straight away means loss for the poor of Uttar Pradesh. Absence of GST straight away means loss for the poor people of Bihar. Not passing the GST would mean loss for the poor people of poor states like Bengal, Orissa and Assam. People who sit in the Rajya Sabha must understand this. GST is beneficial for the poor people of the states represented by them, because those states will economically benefit the most from GST. The money will be used for the welfare of the poor people of those states. This is why be it Mamata Banerjee, be it Nitish Kumar, be it Akhilesh Yadav or Naveen Patnaik, all these states want the GST bill to be passed at the earliest. There is just one group which has made it the issue of prestige. Now the kind of arithmetic which is working out, I hope that this decision is passed in favour of the poor. You will be surprised to what extent has the opposition reached to the level of distortion. In the previous session we introduced an act. Indian government has Rs 40,000 crore rupees from the CAMPA Fund. Rs 40,000 crore. we wanted to give that money to the states. States have to use that money for forestry, for greenery, for planting trees and plants. The bill is meant for that. Had this Rs 40,000 crore reached the states before the monsoons, it would have been used for the forests. A lot of people would have got employment, people who plant trees would have been employed. There would be plantation and due to the rains the plants would start growing within a year. But just because of obstructionism, states have been deprived of the benefit of Rs 40,000 crore. The money was meant for the forests and for the tribals. They blocked it. There was no argument on itThe reason...you had triedMade all efforts.You had invited former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi here at the Race Course RoadWe held talks at every levelStill? The word you used 'ego issue', why has it become an ego issue? And people would want to know why is the Prime Minister unable to end this?The Prime Minister cannot answer this question. Those creating obstructions can only answer this question. But despite this, I will keep trying. I am ready to convince them in which ever way possible. If I have to convoke someone over a cup of tea at their house, I am even ready for that. I have no problem. My only aim is the welfare of the poor of my country and the poor of states like Uttar Pradesh.You spoke of Uttar Pradesh. Mr Prime Minister, elections will be held in Uttar Pradesh in 6,7,8 months. The focus of entire nation will be on it. You are the MP from Varanasi. But some comments are made by BJP, some say Sangh Parivar, some independent groups, communal colour is added to it and not just from one party but from other parties as well. Mr Prime Minister are you going to be able to keep development as the sole agenda? The main issue in the Uttar Pradesh polls should be that of development, it shouldn't get capsized, the focus shouldn't be elsewhere. Are you confident that communal agenda will not overpower development?It's my conviction, it's my commitment. You must have seen during the 2014 elections that I fought elections on the issue of development. The new generation of the country only believes in development. I believe that solution to all problems is in development. Development is also the solution to the tension that people talk about. If we provide employment to people, if we ensure there's food on their plates, if we provide them with facilities and give them education, all the tension will end. And this is why, all those who want good for the nation, I request them to compete towards development and for development. This atmosphere should be created in the country and I think such an environment is being created nowadays.So the hot heads who make extreme comments, is there a necessity to control them? So that there is no politics in the name of religionFirstly, I am of the firm belief that the nation should progress on the issue of development. And it is necessary that the country moves forward on the issue of development. I would like to tell the media not to make heroes out of those people who make such comments.But they keep making such commentsDon't make them heroes, they will stopWe don't make them heroes, we make them villains.But why do you make them so big? I see such statements by people on TV, whose faces I haven't even seen and they end up becoming spokesmen on TVSelf styled spokesmenI don't know why such people are encouragedMr Prime Minister, let's talk in 2016 of the 2017 elections. After Delhi, then Bihar, then Assam, West Bengal. After that we will talk about Punjab. Before we finish talking about Punjab, we will talk about Uttar Pradesh. Then there is the Gujarat state election. Don't you think that this country is permanently stuck in an electoral cycle? The focus constantly and I want you to reflect on this issue, the focus is on party politics, polarising issues, not on governance. We are a country, if we say, we are constantly in a political campaign mode. Is this a good thing? Should we break away from it? And what is your view on it?See this is not an issue about Narendra Modi or the Prime Minister. And also it is not an issue about a particular party or a particular Government.But before the last Parliament session, the Speaker had called all the parties for a meal. After the agenda meeting everyone was sitting to eat. I had also reached at the same time. While talking casually over food, almost people from all parties said that the central and state elections must be held together. Everyone said it. After that during the farewell function of the Rajya Sabha MPs, people from different parties were talking with each other. One of the leaders said, Modiji do anything but get us out of this cycle of electionsWas that leader from your party?No, he was not from my party. So I said that discussion should happen. What is wrong in that? Then one day I said that this was being talked about. This issue has also been discussed in a Parliamentary committee. This work has also been started by the Election Commission and I think they have also writen a letter on it. Like in the fight against black money, this issue of elections also gets connected to black money. Electoral reforms are necessary if the country has to be rid of black money. It is one of the areas for electoral reforms. I believe that the Prime Minister cannot take a decision on this and nor should he do that. Neither the government can do this. There should be a broad discussion on this and we should not run away from the debate on this continious cycle of elections. The Indian voter today is very mature. He votes in one fashion in the Lok Sabha elections, he votes in a different manner in the State Assembly elections. We have seen this. In 2014, the General Elections conincided with the Odisha Assembly elections. The same electorate gave one judgement for Odisha and another judgement for Delhi. So this country's voter is very mature and we should trust his maturity. There should be a debate on how costs can be reduced by holding simultaneous elections, how the influence of black money can be curbed, how the five years can be spent in taking the country forward. Today due to the model code of conduct, there is a loss even in those areas where the code is not applicable. When I was in Gujarat, I found that at least 80 to 90 officers were spending two to three months on election duties in other states. This could be happening in every state. So this is an area of concern and some time or the other this question will have to be thought of. I would want the Election Commission to take this debate forward. They should invite all political parties and hold discussions with everybody and whatever comes out of itCan there be a timebound resolution in this?The Election Commission will have to invite all political parties to discuss this. The process will get derailed if one party were to initiate thisAre you willing to take the lead in building that consensus?Despite being the Prime Minister, I still belong to a political party. The better thing would be for the Election Commission to initiate this. Today the Election Commission is a very prestigious institution in our country. Every political party believes in the Election Commission and it will further empower this institution and that will be betterI think it is an interesting idea of simultaneous elections. Though state parties, regional parties may feel that it will effect them badly. That the national parties like the BJP will gainOdisha is the best example. Odisha is the best example. In 2014, the BJP had no advantage in the state but the BJP won on the Lok Sabha seats. This shows the differenceMr Prime Minister how are you keeping your schedule nowadays? I mean you keep a terrifying pace. The number of meetings you hold, people say your officers find it hard to keep upIt is not so, it has been 2 years now and everyone is used to the work. I believe that it is such a big country that one must do as much work as possible. So I keep doing thatBefore I come to my last question Mr Prime Minister, one issue that I want to come to is the farmers' crisis. As you are well aware, there has been a crisis in this country, you referred to it. In that speech to your MPs, about which I asked you earlier as well, on 20th May in the Central Hall of Parliament you said that 'this government is not for myself, this government is for the poor, we must do something for them.' The farmers' crisis Mr Prime Minster is a reality. I am glad that in this interview you have not avoided the reality, you've faced it, you've talked about it. We have linked our entire future to the monsoons. How do we overcome this from becoming an annual crisis in this country?We will have to put stress on water management here. You must have seen that under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayi Yojana, we have put stress on water issues. During these drought days, I met leaders from 11 states separately and sat with them for about 2-3 hours each. The country would have believed that their Prime Minister is working even if I had held a meeting with 11 of them together for around 10 minutes. But I didn't do that. I sat with leaders from different states separately to understand specific problems and what we could do for water in those states. I am happy, whichever party the state government affiliated to, all the governments focused a lot on water issues this summer. We will reap its benefits this monsoon. Using scientific methods for water accumulation and irrigation, collecting water and directing them towards the fields, everyone did that. Micro irrigation is stressed upon. Even for sugarcane farming, farmers are slowly moving towards micro irrigation which earlier happened through flood irrigation. Paddy crops for which large amount of water is used. Today, farmers have started using drip irrigation for it. If we do well in water facilities, then one of the problems is solved. After independence, for the first time, we have brought in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana which can cover maximum number of farmers. The farmer will have to pay only 2%, only 2%, the government will take care of the rest. The farmers will get an assurance. For instance, in Maharashtra, the monsoons are expected in the month of June, the farmers have prepared for everything but haven't started with the sowing process. Now if there are no rains till August, so practically his crops have not been damaged, because he did not sow the seeds. But the Pradhan Mantri fasal Beema Yojana even takes this into consideration and benefits the farmer. Another important aspect, once the crops are harvested, they're cut and kept in the field, assuming it has been a good year for crop growth, with 100% crop production, but it hasn't been loaded on trucks and sent to the market yet. And if it rains, even after 15 days of harvesting, if there is loss, it is covered under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana. Second layer of protection, minimum premium with maximum cover. After independence, for the first time, we have brought in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana. Thirdly, first time we have brought in E-Mandi concept. Farmer in the village, can sell the crops to the best markets in the country through his mobile phone. Farmer would set the price at which the crop would be sold. Earlier, farmers used to take the produce on carts or tractors, used to go to a mandi 20-25kms away, then due to storage issues, even if they had to sell for Rs 10 less than the price, they used to sell it. Now, sitting at home the farmer would know what price to sell the crops at. Next point is about, food processing, value addition. We opened up 100% foreign direct investment in food processing. For example, if a farmer is selling tomatoes and if a company is processing tomato ketchup then my farmers would benefit from it. The companies that make aerated drinks, Coca-Cola, Pepsi etc, I requested them to add 5% natural fruit juice. In regions near Nagpur and Vidarbha where oranges are cultivated, Coca-Cola is going to add 5% of orange juice. If we add 5% natural juice to aerated water, farmers would get their market and their fruits wouldn't go waste. We should have a comprehensive all-out scheme. So much of our land has been damaged. We have brought in Soil Health Card. We have a Soil Health Abhiyan. The farmer will know the feritility of the land through it. Whether a fertilizer needs to be used or not, the farmer will understand. On an average, a farmer with 1 hectare of land will be able to save Rs 15000-20000. So we have brought in scientific methods. You would know that in our country, farmers used to be lathicharged when they would go to buy urea and they had to buy it in black. We got urea 100% neem coated. Earlier, urea used to go to chemical factories, and the government subsidies were stolen in the name of farmers. After neem coating, urea cannot be used for any other purpose except farming. Because of neem coating, there is a qualitative change which helps in healing the damaged land. Due to neem coating a piece of land that used 10 kgs of urea can now manage with 7 kgs of urea. All these initiatives are in the direction of agriculture and the results will be seen soon.Do you think that the farmers' crisis will be resolved, the question I asked, that it won't be an annual affair, the dependence on monsoons will go down?See agriculture is a state subject. The Indian government has taken initiatives, if the state government are enthusiastic to implement this, which I think they will be. As I told you I met leaders from different states and they worked a lot for water issues. If this works, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana has direct involvement of the central government, it will have great benefits.Mr Prime Minister now I have two questions for you.This has become too long.I'll club these two (questions) together. You're also enjoying it and I am glad you're speaking Mr Prime Minister because there is so much ground to cover and I think viewers would like to hear your view, sir. Actually there are three, if you allow me. They're short questions. First is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, how much is politics playing on your mind? In the sense that every Prime Minister, especially someone who is as forthright as you, looks at the next big challenge. Is 2019 anywhere in your mind?Those who have seen me in Gujarat, and those who have seen me in the last two years, those who see me without any bias, they will know that I am an apolitical Prime Minister. Apart from elections, I don't get involved into politics ever. You can call elections a necessity, a restraint or a responsibility, we have to do it. I attend many functions, go to different areas, you wouldn't have heard any political comment from me. If I go to a government function, I talk about government related topics. If I attend a Railways function I talk about railways, if water then water, if water bodies, then water bodies. My focus is on governance. Country has been at greatest loss because governments were run only for elections. Governments must not run only for elections. The government should be a bona fide attempt of meeting the demands and expectations of the common people. Elections should just be a bi-product. It is a democracy. Winning and losing is a part of it. It shouldn't be hyped. You would have seen recently I urged everyone to pay taxes before 30th September. I even said it on Mann Ki Baat yesterday. Will a person, who is only concerned with winning elections, say that post 30th September you'd face problems?This was also a warning in a way.It is a warning. It is definitely a warning. It is a warning. My first warning is to my government officers to not presume citizens as thieves. I have already given this warning. I have handled my officers first. It took me quite some time. You will be shocked to hear that I have given an early retirement to more than 30 people from Income Tax Department on integrity issues. This isn't a small issue. People who weren't transferred since 20 years, I got them transferred. So, one, my focus is on my system. Second, I also tell the country, that for the poor of the nation we would have to give out something for the poor in our country. It is my responsibility to give the people an account of every rupee. I will use it at right places. I won't let it get stolen. But if I need to give houses to the poor, we would need revenue. I don't want to increase taxes, I just want taxes to be paid honestly. There is no need to increase the taxes. The country can run without troubling the citizens. I am working towards it. That is why I have given the citizens a chance to pay the taxes till 30th September, whatever it is Rs 10,000 or Rs. 50,000. If they think they want to come into mainstream, they must and shouldn't be worried. After 30th September, the government will have to take steps. I will not worry about the polls. I will take the necessary steps. I want to work for the poor in my country.Mister Prime Minister, do some crystal ball gazing for the next three years. For the next three years, to use the cricketing analogy, how do you find your run rate so far and will you have to score at a higher run rate in the next three years to achieve your targets?See, no matte at what speed I move forward, I am never satisfied. If today I run at a speed of 100, I keep an aim of running at 200. I think that the world that was behind us, has gone ahead. We need to run a lot to match that level. So we do not need to calculate. We just need to give it all in. And I have given myself in completely. I've been successful is pulling my entire government in. I believe that the country is also committed to move forwardFinal question to you Mr Prime Minister, what motivates you the most? First of all as I said, will you be able to keep this pace? What motivates you the most and also if you can share with our viewers honestly what is your one greatest source of worry?Firstly, I don't live under the burden of worries. Problems and challenges are there, you can't deny that. But you must challenge the challenges and not let the challenges turn into worries. This is my principle. I challenge the challenges. I like to face the problems. I don't run away from them. Whatever loss I have to face for it, I face it. But I can't leave the country helpless. This responsibility must be taken and I will continue to do so. For all good and bad things, it is my responsibility. I do not regret anything. I believe, people of the country have given me the responsibility and I must fulfill it. Thirdly, when I see the poor in our country, it reminds me of the work that I have to do for them. Day before yesterday, I was in Pune, and met a Shrimaan Chandrakant ji. A retired teacher with a pension of Rs 16000, donates Rs 5000 every month for Swachh Abhiyaan. If a 70 year old retired teacher with children and family at home, without worrying about them, worries about the country, then being the Prime Minister, I should work a thousand times more than Chandrakant ji. This is my inspiration. People of this country who work day and night, they are my inspiration. I look at them and I work even harder.Prime Minister Narendra Modi it has been a privilege. I am grateful for this interview.Thank youAnd thank you on behalf of all our viewers that you spoke frankly.

Thank you very muchThanks a lot. Thank you very much.","prime minister's interviewprism of pakistanprime minister narendra modi in an interview with times now has shared his views on a range of issues. here is the complete transcript of thewith arnab goswami.prime minister modi thank you very much for this interview. thank you very muchmy greetings to all the peoplethis is your first one to one interview to a private news channel since you became prime minister. and if i am not mistaken, this is the first ever interview by a sitting prime minister of india to a private television news channel in the country. so i would first like to thank you and am very grateful for the opportunity.the world of the media has grown so big that everybody has to attach themselves with it.i am very grateful and our viewers will be very grateful also mr modi because they want to hear your views on a range of subjects. mr prime minister i would like to start by taking you back to 20th may 2014. the results came on may 16th. four days later, you gave a historic speech in the central hall of parliament and you were speaking to the members of parliament. you had said four days after the results that an era of responsibility has begun. and that you said that in 2019 before the elections, i will come back to this parliament, i will come back to the mps and i will give my report card. forty percent into your tenure, how much have you achieved of your own targets?when i went for the first time as an mp to the central hall, and it was the first time i was seeing the central hall. i had not been there before. so i had then said that becoming the prime minister was not about the designation of the office but it was about the responsibilities and work of being a pm. i had also said that my government would be committed to the poor. i was completely new in the job. delhi was new for me. the delhi environment was new to me. the work of the government of india was also new for me. but despite that, in such a short time, the pace at which the country has moved forward, and it's not on one subject. you can pick up any aspect of the government's functioning, and if you make a comparison with the past governments, then you will realize that no issue has been ignored. there has been an effort to bring in something new in every area. there is an effort to bring in change in every area. one big challenge was that i was not experienced about this place, i had not even been an mp. the office was new, the questions were also new. but when i look at the second biggest challenge, we should remember those days when the country was engulfed in disappointment. the everyday news was about whether there would be any electricity production after seven days, whether coal would be supplied or not. this was the situation then. the entire system was engulfed in disappointment. the big challenge was to inject new trust into the system and create confidence among the citizens. it is very difficult to evaluate this from the outside but i have gone through it. but today i can say with a lot of satisfaction that now there is no trace of any disappointment. the intention to do something is visible. and it's not in words but in actual achievement. i had said that within a given timeframe, we will open bank accounts for the poor. for something that had not been done for 60 years, setting a timeframe for it was in itself a risk. but because of that a trust was created in the system that it was something doable. so that's the process i started for awakening the confidence. and today you can see that in every sector, the changed circumstances can be seen. while evaluating the performance of this government, never forget that you will have to make that evaluation in comparison with the 10 years of the previous government. only then will you know where we were and where we are now. we should not be talking about what we are aiming for. for now you will have to assess the present in comparison with the immediate past and in that you will find a bright futuremr. modi, i want to start now on the issue of foreign policy. in the area of foreign policy, you have taken great personal interest. the amount of personal interest you have shown in foreign policy, probably none of the previous prime ministers showed the same kind of interest. your approach is pro active. what i find interesting about your foreign policy is that you have balanced different powers and different interests. on the one side, your relationship with us, you made sure that india enters the missile control technology regime with them. a week before that you also signed the historic chabahar port agreement with iran. so, you have balanced very diverse forces. my question to you over this is that, is it easy to do that as an indian prime minister? secondly, on the issue of the nsg, you staked a lot of personal interest, personal push, you lobbied actively. how close are we to getting the nsg seat?firstly, about foreign policy, you need to know what has strengthened our foreign policy. for 30 years, in our country, the government was unstable. for 30 years, party with a clear mandate wasn't given the opportunity to form the government. the world measures the government of a nation on the basis of its condition in its own country, on how strong their word is in their own country. i am thankful to the people of this country, that after 30 years, they chose a government with absolute majority and this has had an impact on world politics. countries and world leaders have changed their perspective towards india. this is the biggest benefit. secondly, the world didn't know me. the world wants to know who the head of the state is. if someone would want to know modi through the eyes of the media, then he would be disillusioned on which modi is the real modi. if this happens, the country will be at a loss. modi's personality shouldn't be a hindrance for the world to have faith in india. but for that unless i meet all those leaders and engage them them one to one, unless i speak to them frankly, they wouldn't know about india's head of state, so it was very important for me as i am not from a political family. i never had the opportunity to meet the world leaders earlier.you were an unknown entity in foreign policymore than foreign policy it was foreign relations. yes, i was new to it. so for me, being pro active was mandatory. thirdly, we work as a team. foreign ministry, prime minister's officer, commerce ministry, finance ministry, defense minister, everyone works as a team, not as separate pieces. the impact that is now visible, is not just because of modi, it is because of the team. all teams work in a particular direction. that is why the impact is seen, earlier these teams were splintered. we have seen instances where the party would give a statement, the prime minister would say something else, party leaders would say something else. this disunity has had a negative impact. thirdly, we also need to understand that earlier the world was bi polar. foreign policy would be centered around two super powers. india was a little late in realizing that this bi polar situation was for namesake. now the entire world, in changed circumstances, especially in 21st century, it is more interdependent and inter connected, earlier, the foreign policy was possible between governments, but today it is not possible just between governments. government relations are important but increasing people to people contact is equally important. there's been a shift in paradigm. because i do not have any previous baggage, because i've had a clean slate, i write everything from beginning and that has a benefit. today we are building relations with countries across the world. the amount of respect with which i engage saudi arabia, i engage iran with the same amount of respect. the amount of respect with which i speak to america, i speak to russia with the same amount of respect. so we need to understand this. we also need to understand that we shouldn't consider smaller countries insignificant. i abide by this principle. the small countries of the world are as important as the big nations. we had assumed that the relations with smaller nations would develop under the shadow of the bigger nations. i brought about a change in this. you must have seen that i made a forum for the pacific island nations. we have had two meetings. i went there once and they came here once. these are small countries with a population of about 10 lakh or 20 lakh. but these small island nations are most affected by global warming. when india took up the international solar mission and 122 nations joined it, the island nations benefitted the most out of it. they are 50 in number now. a group of 50 nations, feels secured with this vision of india. if we try to understand this change, then we would realize that in the world, a few days back, i was sitting with the officers of our foreign services, so as we got talking, in a very poetic way i told them that there was a time when we used to sit by the sea and count the waves, but the time has now changed, we are done counting waves, now it's time for us to steer ourselves, ride the waves and decide on our direction, destination and speedthat is apparent. you have a very aggressive foreign policy. but my second question was, you put so much effort for nsg membership. my question was, how close are we to nsg membership and were you disappointed that we did not make it at the very end because of china's opposition?look the first thing is that india has been continuously making these efforts, no matter which government was in office. be it the membership of the un security council or the sco membership or mtcr membership or nsg membership. every government has made an effort. it's not that only this government is trying, it's in continuity. but it's during our tenure that we achieved sco membership, we also got the mtcr membership. i have full faith that now we have begun a coordinated effort for the nsg membership too. the process has begun on a positive note. everything has rules and will work accordingly and move forwardis it the problem of mindset with china? there have been 13 engagements at various levels between the narendra modi government and the chinese government. the latest engagement was when you went to tashkent. you spent some time with the chinese president xi jinping. yet it was seen that in the case of masood azhar, china blocked india's un bid to ban him. now they have stalled india's nsg bid. why is china repeatedly blocking us mr prime minister despite your personal proactive measures and your government's outreach?the first thing is that we have an ongoing dialogue with china and it should continue to happen. in foreign policy it's not necessary to have similar views to have a conversation. even when the views are contradictory, talks are the only way forward and problems should be resolved through dialogue. we don't have one problem with china, we have a whole lot of problems pending with china. slowly and steadily, an effort is on to address these issues through talks and make them less cumbersome. i can say that china has been cooperating with india to search for solutions. on some issues, it's a question of principles for them. on some issues, it's a question of principles for us. on some issues they differ with us and there are issues on which we differ with them. there are some basic differences. but the most important thing is that we can speak to china eye-to-eye and put forth india's interests in the most unambiguous manner. we are a government that takes care of india's interests. we don't compromise on this. three days ago i met the chinese president. i told him clearly about india's interests. they are a different country, we are a different countrydo you think you will be able to change their mindset on the issue of nsg membership?see the foreign policy is not about changing mindsets. foreign policy is about finding the common meeting points. where do our interests converge and how much? we have to sit and talk with every country. it's our ongoing effortthis statement that you just made is also apt in the context of america where you gave a speech in the u.s congress. by the way mr prime minister it was a fantastic speechthank youthere was a lot of humour. you were laughing and cracking jokes while you delivered the speech which was very unique. they also appreciated it. was the speech impromptu?i have a humourous side but these days humour can be a risky thingwhy do you say that?in this era of 24/7 news channels, anybody can lift a small word and make a big issue out of it. but i will tell you the truth, the reason for the absence of humour in public life is this fear. i am myself scared . earlier when i used to make speeches, i would make it so humourous but there would never be any issueshave you become more conscious now?i am not conscious. i am in fear, there is no humour left in public life because of this fear. everyone is scared. i am in fear. my speeches used be humourous. i see it in parliament, that humour is finished there too. it is a matter of concern. i will quote one proverb.yes, go ahead.even if you mention a proverb, they will connect it with something else and begin a conversation. the one who is saying the proverb does not know for what he is speaking.but you should not lose your sense of humour mr prime ministerbut it is true that my trip to the united states of america, my speech in their congress and the respect shown towards india created a lot of hype. had it not been hyped so much, there would not have been so much criticism on the nsg issue. government is being criticized not for any mishandling of the nsg issue but because we were so successful over there (in the usa)did china become conscious of your growing friendship with us?i am talking about what's happening herebut when you delivered that speech in context of america, you used a very interesting phrase. you said 'we have to overcome the hesitations of history'. my hindi is not that good. like hesitations of history. but my question to you is mr prime minister, how close can we get to america because many indians believe that america is still supporting pakistan, giving them military assistance. how close can we get? at what point do we stop before we are seen like an american ally? what is your own world view on that?i would especially like to appeal to my country's media that we should stop looking at everything in india from the. india is an independent country. it is a country of 125 crore people. whenever it approaches any country, it will only be concerned about its own interests. it has been our biggest shortcoming and mistake that we have been tagging ourselves with another country and trying to do things. we are an independent country, we have our own policies and future. we have to think about the future of our 125 crore people. there should be no compromise on our interests. we have relations with america in the context of these fundamental pointshow close can we get to them?there has been warmth in our relationship. you must have seen the editorials in american newspapers after my visit to that country. one point mentioned in those editorials was that the success of obama's foreign policy has been the warm relationship with india. this has been saidwhat you are saying modiji is that we can be close to america but we need not be an ally or seen to be an ally?the first thing is that we no longer live in a bipolar world. the world is interconnected and interdependent. you will have to connect with everybody at the same time. even if there are two opposing countries, they will have to be friends. now the times have changedmr modi, on 8th may 2014, i had the opportunity to interview you, the interview took place in ahmedabad, i think one last phase of elections was left. we were discussing the issue of pakistan. you have had an uncompromising approach towards pakistan. two days back, lashkar e toiba killed 8 crpf jawans in an attack. in the 8th may interview, you put forth a very interesting phrase, you said 'can talks be heard amidst the noise of bombs, guns and pistols?' this is how you had phrased it. do you believe we have been too generous towards pakistan? do you believe we have been too generous towards pakistan?there are two things. one - india has always wanted friendly ties with its neighbours, there can be no debate around it. we want to live in harmony and peace. and i have said it repeatedly, that india has to fight poverty, pakistan too has to fight poverty, why don't we come together to fight poverty? i said this before elections and during election campaigns. also i had invited leaders of saarc nations to my swearing in ceremony and they had attended it as well. so there has been no change in our intent, our thoughts and our current behaviour. number two - those who have to work from the table, will work from the table and those who have to work at the border, will work at border with full strength. each one will fulfill the responsibility entrusted to them. and our jawans are fulfilling their responsibilities. it's true that pressure on terrorists has increased, their schemes are proving unsuccessful. the intent with which they move forward are foiled and they have to face major challenges. it is because of this disappointment that such incidents are taking place and our jawans are risking their lives and protecting the country. we are very proud of our jawanswhen your foreign policy is studied, observers analyze what's happening and what's not happening. if you give me the opportunity, i want to do a bit of analyses. there was a terrific pace of engagement with pakistan between october, november and december. on 30th november, you met nawaz sharif on the sidelines (of un climate summit in paris). both of you were seated on a sofa, talking to each other. a lot of people were speculating the contents of your conversation. this was on the sidelines of climate summit. after that, all of a sudden within seven days there were nsa level talks and ajit doval spoke to nasir janjua in bangkok. and again after that you went to russia via afghanistan, you made an unexpected visit to nawaz sharif in lahore. it was a personal trip but it still had some level of importance. eight days later, pakistani terrorists attacked pathankot. can you tell our viewers whether pakistan was proactively responding in the months of october, november and december? did the pathankot terror attack change the situation? is it true that pakistan was making a lot of movement in those three months?look there are different types of forces operating in pakistan. but the government only engages with a democratically elected system. our effort for that engagement is continuing. but our supreme objective is peace. our supreme objective is to protect india's interests. we keep making effort toward that objective and sometimes our efforts are successful. as far as meetings and talks are concerned, we signalled right from the day i took oath and sent invitations for the oath taking ceremony, that we seek friendly relations but without compromising on our interests. and that is why i have said that my country's soldiers have full freedom to answer back in whatever manner they have to and they will keep doing thatmr prime minister what is the 'lakshman rekha' that you would draw when it comes to pakistan. there is some confusion surrounding this subject. i would like you to give an elaborate reply. in 2014, it was believed that if talks are being held, then they should be held between two countries and not with hurriyat. it should be between the government of india and the government of pakistan. the other 'lakshman rekha' is that you must act on 26/11. there's been no forward movement so far. the third thing is about forward movement on the pathankot attack case. so what is the 'lakshman rekha' now and if pakistan remains within those bounds, so talks can happen at the political level or at any other level?the first thing is that with pakistan, to whom do we talk to decide about the 'lakshman rekha'. will it be with the elected government or with other actors? that is why india will have to be on alert all the time. india will have to be alert every moment. there can never be any laxity in this. but there is an outcome due to my continuous efforts like my visit to lahore and my invitation to the pakistani prime minister to come to india. now i don't have to explain to the world about india's position. the world is unanimously appreciating india's position. and the world is seeing that pakistan is finding it difficult to respond. if we had become an obstacle, then we would have had to explain to the world that we are not that obstacle. now we don't have to explain to the world. the world knows our intentions. like on the issue of terrorism, the world never bought india's theory on terrorism. they would sometime dismiss it by saying that it's your law and order problem. today the world has to accept what india has been saying about terrorism. india's dialogue on terrorism, the losses india has suffered due to terrorism, the losses suffered by humanity, the world is now acknowledging that. so i believe we have to take this process forwardmr prime minister i now want to move to questions on the economy. in the past two years you have started many schemes. if we look at the theme of jan dhan yojna for financial inclusion, pradhan mantri fasal bima yojna for crop insurance, swach bharat, skill india, make in india. if we see the theme running through these schemes, is your social agenda at the core of your personal economic philosophy, social transformation? is the social agenda at the core of your economic philosophy as the prime minister?the first point is our philosophy is to reach the last man in the line. pandit deendayal upadhyay's philosophy forms the core of our political, economic and social ideology. and even mahatma gandhi used to say that what is there for the last man? so my development parameter is very simple. it is about how the poorest of the poor can benefit from development. the poor is the central focus of my economic agenda. the poor should be strengthened in such a way that they get the willingness to defeat poverty. by helping the poor make ends meet while they remain in poverty is also one of the ways. i am not saying right or wrong but it's one of the ways. but today the country's situation is such that we should make the poor strong so that they become partners in defeating poverty. all these schemes are meant to empower the poor and change the quality of life. the pradhan mantri jan dhan yojna is not only about opening bank accounts for the poor. because of this the poor are feeling that they are becoming a part of the country's economic system. the bank that he was seeing from afar, now he is able to enter that bank. this brings about a psychological transformation. looked at in another way, did you ever imagine that 40 thousand crores could be injected into the banking system by contributions from the poor. the poor who never had bank accounts, have deposited 100 rupees, 50 rupees or 200 rupees. it means that poor man saved 100 rupees and the change began in his life. we have taken up construction of toilets. i had gone to chhattisgarh and had the opportunity to get the blessings of one mother. an adivasi mother heard about the scheme for building toilets. she sold her four goats and built a toilet. that 90 old mother uses a walking stick and goes around the cluster of 30 or 40 houses in the tribal village and has been spreading the message to build toilets. this change is becoming the reason for the change in the quality of life. i have begun the cleanliness campaign. it's estimated an individual spends an average of 7000 rupees for treatment of a disease. the main reason for disease is filth. the poor suffer the most from the filth. if a poor man falls sick, he cannot drive his rickshaw for two days and his children go hungry. so how can we help the poor bring about change in their lives? now there is a neo-middle class and a middle class in the country. the young have their aspirations. so another aspect of my policies you must have seen are the start up india, stand up india, seaport activity, port activity, railways expansion, railway station upgradation. these changes directly appeal to the middle class. the middle class has its aspirations. we have to create jobs? how will job creation happen? till i invest in the development of infrastructure, there be no job creation. you must have seen that the maximum electricity generation since independence has occurred this year. the maximum amount of coal mined has been in this year. the maximum length of roads being constructed daily is happening in this year. the fastest loading and unloading of steamers at sea ports is happening now. all these changes are creating opportunities for employment like in start up india, stand up india. for instance in stand up india, i have said that every bank should give an economic opportunity to one woman, one dalit or one tribal person to become entrepreneurs. this will create many job opportunities. so this is the basis of my economic philosophy.mr prime minister if i could interrupt you on this. on the one hand is the people's expectations and on the other is your vision. many programs that you have mentioned, you can't put a calendar date to it but they don't have an immediate impact. they maybe able to show results in 3, 4, 5 maybe beyond 5 years. now there are challenges in that. mr prime minister, you are aware more than anyone else that people want immediate results. now you spoke of job creation. the first thing, as an achievement you have managed to grow the economy at 7.5 per cent when the global economic climate is very bleak. you have spoken about it as well. you have met fiscal deficit targets, fdi inflows have increased but people are saying that job opportunities are not increasing. you have spoken about infrastructure but the current rate of unemployment. mr prime minister, the latest labour bureau figures, is it a source of concern for you as the prime minister?the first thing is that are 800 million people below the age of 35 in our country. we have to accept that the demand for jobs is very high. but where will they get employment? investment will come in. it will be used in the infrastructure sector, manufacturing and services sector. now like the initiative we have taken, we have started the mudra yojna. more than three crore people in the country comprise washermen, barbers, milkman, newspaper vendors, cart vendors. we have given them nearly 1.25 lakh crore rupees without any guarantee. now why have these people taken the money? to expand their work. when he expands his work, if he is currently employing one person, now he has to employ two people. if there were two employed earlier, now there are three. now just think, when 3 crore of these small businesses have got access to finance, they must have expanded their work. now all this is not in the labour department's registration. three crore people have expanded their work. we took another small decision. the big malls in the country run 365 days a year but the smaller shops have to close on holidays. we announced in the budget that even a small shopkeeper can operate his shop till late night and that too on all the seven days of the week. if the malls don't have restrictions then why should the small shopkeepers have restrictions. so now if a shopkeeper operates his shop till late and on all seven days, if he earlier employed one person, now he will have to employ two people. so won't the employment increase?so is your focus on entrepreneurship?our focus is on all aspects. now we are saying that by 2022 we want to ensure that everyone has a house. housing sector has the maximum potential for creating employment. houses will be built in such huge numbers, how many people will get employment? you must have seen that last year we brought in a textile policy. under this textile policy, there will be income tax benefits for those who create employment. the more employment one creates, the more tax benefits they will get. for the first time, employment generation and tax has been linked. these are the things that boost employment and our central focus is creating employment for the ordinary citizenmr prime minister, questions are also being raised on food inflation which has still not decreased. the expectation was that the food inflation would decline. the people had put their hopes on the prime minister that you will bring down prices. this not only has a political impact but also has a social impact. over the past two weeks, there were reports that in some places the price of arhar dal had touched 150 rupees and 200 rupees for other pulses. the price of tomatoes was also rising. is this only seasonal because the food inflation is increasing at 7.5 per cent year on year. global oil prices have fallen. do you think this creates perception issues for your government?you can't view inflation as a perception issue. price rise should be seen as a reality. what is available for a consumer should be seen for what it is. there should never be an attempt to view price rise as a perception issue as a means of escaping the reality of price rise. we will have to accept reality. you see the fast pace at which prices were rising under the previous government, today that speed has decelerated a lot. you can see the statistics, you will find it there. second, the country has gone through two consecutive years of severe drought. drought has a direct impact on the price of vegetables, food and pulses because all these things are produced from the soil. now when there is such a big drought, it's not in anybody's hands. the second option in such a situation is imports. the indian government has imported pulses in huge quantities. third, it is the joint responsibility of the state and central governments. it is not exclusively the state's responsibility. it is not exclusively the centre's responsibility. it is the joint responsibility of both the state and central governments. this should not be an issue of blame game that the state government did not do certain things and that the centre did not do certain things. but it will have to be agreed that it is the joint responsibility of both. that is why the centre has given rights to the states to make stringent laws. how much stocks to keep or not to keep are decisions which the states can take. all these rights have been given to the states. some states have performed well, some states are trying. but the centre and state governments are trying to work together on this. i believe that we have been successful to the extent that the speed with which prices were rising (under upa), what would have happened if the prices were to rise at that speed. we have been successful in stopping that speedy rise of prices. but as far as pulses are concerned, production in india has been very low. many farmers who were earlier sowing pulses have started cultivating sugar. that is also an area of concern. we gave special incentives for pulses. we have tried to set up a different msp for pulses. we have taken steps to procure pulses from farmers with bonus. our focus is on increasing the production of pulses. we are also focusing on building stocks of pulses by importing from abroad. an all out effort is being made and i believe that nobody doubts the sincerity of this governmentmr prime minister what is your view about the controversy around the exit of raghuram rajan as the rbi governor? a lot has been spoken about this. there was commentary that it may effect india's image, perception as a global economy. what's your own view of the controversy around the exit of raghuram rajan?when my government was formed in may 2014, you take newspapers from may, june, july 2014 and check television debates during that period. the topic of the television debates would be - will the new govt let raghuram rajan continue? or will the new government oust raghuram rajan? and there was more or less consensus that he was appointed by the previous govt and so modi won't let him complete his tenure and will remove him. you have seen, that he worked his entire tenure. for the time he was appointed by the previous government, he completing his entire term. so all the misconceptions have been dispelled. secondly, according to my 2 year experience in govt, those who are creating controversies, are being unjust to raghuram rajanwhy so?i will tell you. those who say...i believe raghuram rajan's patriotism is no less than any of ours. it will be doing injustice to him if one says that he will serve the country only if he is at a particular post. as much as i know raghuram rajan, whatever post he holds, wherever he is, he is someone who will continue to serve the country. he is someone who loves his country. therefore, it's not like the nation won't get raghuram rajan's services, raghuram rajan is not that kind of a person. he is a person who loves the country. those who speak such language are doing great injustice to him. my experience with him has been good.i appreciate the work he has done. and my good wishes will always be with himprime minister modi, there's a question related to this. during your speech at the executive you used seven words begining with letter 's'-- 'sevabhaav' (service), 'santulan' (balance), 'sanyam' (restraint), 'samvaad' (dialogue), 'samanvay' (coordination), 'sakaratmak' (positivity) and 'samvedna' (sensitivity). i will ask the question in context with raghuram rajan because you used these words in the speech at national executive meet speech on june 14 in allahabad. you said, 'our party leaders and party workers should use these qualities in their daily dealings and behaviour.' prime minister, in raghuram rajan's context, your rajya sabha mp has made many comments. later he made critical remarks against senior bureaucrats. my question is, do you think it is right? when we talk about 'sanyam' (restraint) and 'santulan' (balance), is it correct?whether it is someone from my party or not, i believe that such things are inappropriate. the nation won't benefit from such publicity stunts. one should be more responsible while conducting themselves. anyone who believes he is bigger than the system is wrong.that's a very clear message.i have a very clear message. i have no two minds about it.and mr prime minister, if i may say so, between may 8 and now, you are speaking as straight as you did before you took over as prime minister. i think that answer takes me to the next subject. mr prime minister, the issue is that of black money. in a very interersting way you said, prices should not be looked at from the point of percepetion, equally, mr prime minister it can be said said that an issue like black money should not be looked at in terms of perception, but it is perception forming. there are political debates on this. experts say that the black money economy has shrunk, 10-15% economy has shrunk through land dealings and other things. you have passed the black money bill, you have made taxation more transparent, you have started information sharing with other countries, you have taken steps, but prime minister modi, people still expect that a rs 25 lakh crores will be brought back and put into their bank accounts. how will you address that expectation? the hope that people have taking black money, how will you address it?how did the black money issue arise and how did it become such a serious issue? we have to look at the background. it is an established fact in the minds of the common man those who steal money park their money overseas. it's a common perception. even if i look at it from the common man's perspective, i also wonder where does this money go? this issue was always stalled in the parliament. when the matter reached the supreme court, the supreme court ordered special investigation team to look into it, even then the previous government stalled it for three years, from 2011-2014. it's after this that political parties, the media and the common man started believing that there's something wrong. then the issue of black money became an agenda. even today i can say...that yes, when there is money stashed in foreign accounts, there are some norms of engagement with foreign countries on the issue. but between 2011-2014, these people were given the opportunity to launder money here and thereand you also said on 17 february 2015 on this issue, that the then law minister is only offering lip servicethe result was that people got several chances to launder money. secondly, after our government was formed, the first decision taken by our cabinet was to form a special investigation team to bring back black money which was pending despite supreme court's 2011 order. this shows our sincerity. from then on, you can't imagine how stringent the laws have been made to bring back black money and whoever comes in its fold will know how strict the law is. thirdly, i attended the g20 summit. never was black money issue discussed in the g20 forum. it was my first g20 summit, for the first time i met the world leaders. and for the first time in the g20 summit, one paragraph was on unaccounted money, on black money and 20 countries said that the world should cooperateblack. the dirty money, black money was also linked to terrorism, an environment of global census was created. we have been signing agreements one after the other with different countries that there will be real time, automatic exchange of information with india. i recently visited switzerland and there was minimal discussion on the issue. but after i returned, a big delegation from switzerland visited india, and they held meeting with the indian government and we discussed...for several years, we believed that switzerland is the place where black money is stashed, that country is holding discussions to come to a consensus on automatic information exchange and if we reach consensus it will be a great achievement. thirdly you must've seen that mauritius route came up in almost everything. it was said that money goes out of india and returns through the mauritius route. this was discussed. everyone thought that nothing can be done about the mauritius route.but our government held a dialogue with the mauritius government, made changes to the old treaty. and we successfully made a new treaty to block the money which comes through the mauritius route and very soon it will be phased out and completed. all these decisions are taken to fight the black money menace. this is not a one sided fight. secondly, the govt is working in a direction to make sure that black money isn't generated in india and black money doesn't go out of india, you can see the results of all this.when the opposition raises the rs 15 lakh issue.that is something the opposition raises during elections. let them have some issue to talk aboutmr prime minister, there has been no major financial corruption or scam in your tenure in the last two years. perception is again, what people say is because you keep a very tight control on the reins of government but the question is there are people, who are wilful defaulters, the economic offenders who take a lot of money from the country or commit economic offences in the country, go overseas and use rules and use lawyers, and they don't come back to india. and people are asking now, is the narendra modi govt determined to take these cases of wilful defaulters and economic offenders to their logical conclusion.firstly, this question is not in the minds of people. the people of india have confidence that if there's someone who can do this, it is narendra modi and he will do it. citizens of the country have full faith.does it worry you, that people have misued the law?i take this as an opportunity and i will show them what the law is.mr. modi, there have been several corruption cases about the previous government, which have now come out. there is agustawestland, many defense scams and defense transactions are now being analyzed seriously. the cases which were quoted in the cag reports but were ignored are now coming in the forefront. this question is important because this isn't just about financial corruption but these questions have direct implications on the national security of the country. do you think, when they say that this is a political witch hunt by narendra modi sarkar, do you think all of these cases would have been possible without political patronage?there are many things which are not visible. one can't imagine the difficulty i am experiencing in taking out things from dirt. one who is working there knows the amount of dirt that exists and how certain things have been caught in a web. there are certain powers behind it. the case about agusta helicopters. i can't deny it and i believe that we have the right to doubt that people behind this are very experienced. they have perfectly practiced the art of doing wrong deeds. they are very experienced and knowledgeable. and one can also smell the fact that such a thing wouldn't have been done without a shield. now, agencies are probing. let's see how far the probe goes. but the investigation shouldn't go ahead while people are being targeted, neither does my government target anyone. the sin has been committed, but how much is done, how was it done, who did it, probe agencies will find out in a professional way. whatever comes out, will be put outprime minister, talking about your speech in the us congress, and the humour that you displayed. i felt some of it was impromptu. but the americans were able to relate to what you said, i don't remember the exact words, you said, i am informed that the working of the us congress is harmonious. and then there was a pause and people were laughing. then you said, 'i am told' - you emphasized and said 'i am told that you are well known for your bipartisanship.' then the applause was more. and then you said, 'you are not alone. time and again i have witnessed a similar spirit in the indian parliament.' you spoke about a serious topic in a interesting manner. you referred to the upper house. there was a lot of response on that too. your humour was really appreciated and i think it was a wonderful moment when you were speaking. but, mr. prime minister, when you look back at the parliament, this question comes to many people's minds, has prime minister narendra modi being held back from achieving his own objectives because of the non-stop parliamentary logjam. how much has this affected his moving towards his own targets? if you critically analyze this situation, do you feel your government could have been more consultative or do you feel the blame is entirely with the opposition?i look at it differently. i believe there have been a lot of problems. whether the fault is ours or their's, i 'll leave it to the people. people will decide. but because of discussions in parliament - we may not come to a decision, the decision could be opposing our view, nothing wrong in that. but at least there should be a discussion. the sad part is, if somebody is running away from debate or don't let discussions happen, then it is a cause of worry in a democracy. whether the government's work is accomplished or not, i don't see it as a cause of worry. if not today, it will happen tomorrow. there are certain things which will happen at an administrative level. the big thing is, parliament is for discussion. parliament is to show dissent. parliament is to give an argument for one's opposition, to present an argument when they support.to uphold this basic spirit of parliament, is the responsibility of every person who values democracy. it is the responsibility of those present in the parliament and those outside. it is the responsibility of those in power and those not in power. this is a matter of spirit and it should be followed. as far as the government is concerned, on every issue and at every forum, we have tried to hold discussions. i myself have met the opposition leaders and spoken to them. key members of the government are also in touch. and you must have seen that many issues have been resolved. in the last session, we have passed 12 bills in rajya sabha, we passed 10 bills in the lok sabha. so the pace has picked up. when people say 'opposition', it is unfair to the opposition. there are some parties in the parliament which are not with the bjp or nda, but are with the government on key decisions. so, to defame the opposition by saying that all opposition parties are against us -- when some people do this, it is wrong. there is one party which has problems. and the whole world knows that party. secondly, to say that 'when you were is opposition, you did it this way' there is a difference between every opposition party. 'we have run the government for 60 years and now we are in the opposition, so we know the nitty-gritties of the government, we know the responsibilities. we can't behave in the way, a new opposition party behaves.' a party which hasn't been in power or hasn't seen anything, could behave in this way. for example, we are in power now, and consider in 2040 we become the opposition party. so, in 2040 we can't have the same conduct as the one we had in 2009 or 2010.congress is a very experienced and old partythat's why i say that, those who have been in power for so many years, shouldn't be doing this. if there is a new party in the opposition, they have a small demand for their state or if an mp has a demand for his/her constituency and does something like this, then we can understand. ones who have been in power for very long, shouldn't be doing such thingsprime minister modi, do you think the gst bill which has been stuck for over one and half years, it is a path-breaking economic reform. it unifies the country. recently you met ms jayalalithaa after she was sworn in as the chief minister, mamata banerjee has extended her support for gst and congress allies at the state level are supporting the gst bill. do you feel optimistic that gst bill will be passed in the next session of the parliament?first we need to understand, that we look at gst only within the purview of an economic reform because of which the right information doesn't come out. not having gst straight away means loss for the poor of uttar pradesh. absence of gst straight away means loss for the poor people of bihar. not passing the gst would mean loss for the poor people of poor states like bengal, orissa and assam. people who sit in the rajya sabha must understand this. gst is beneficial for the poor people of the states represented by them, because those states will economically benefit the most from gst. the money will be used for the welfare of the poor people of those states. this is why be it mamata banerjee, be it nitish kumar, be it akhilesh yadav or naveen patnaik, all these states want the gst bill to be passed at the earliest. there is just one group which has made it the issue of prestige. now the kind of arithmetic which is working out, i hope that this decision is passed in favour of the poor. you will be surprised to what extent has the opposition reached to the level of distortion. in the previous session we introduced an act. indian government has rs 40,000 crore rupees from the campa fund. rs 40,000 crore. we wanted to give that money to the states. states have to use that money for forestry, for greenery, for planting trees and plants. the bill is meant for that. had this rs 40,000 crore reached the states before the monsoons, it would have been used for the forests. a lot of people would have got employment, people who plant trees would have been employed. there would be plantation and due to the rains the plants would start growing within a year. but just because of obstructionism, states have been deprived of the benefit of rs 40,000 crore. the money was meant for the forests and for the tribals. they blocked it. there was no argument on itthe reason...you had triedmade all efforts.you had invited former prime minister manmohan singh and sonia gandhi here at the race course roadwe held talks at every levelstill? the word you used 'ego issue', why has it become an ego issue? and people would want to know why is the prime minister unable to end this?the prime minister cannot answer this question. those creating obstructions can only answer this question. but despite this, i will keep trying. i am ready to convince them in which ever way possible. if i have to convoke someone over a cup of tea at their house, i am even ready for that. i have no problem. my only aim is the welfare of the poor of my country and the poor of states like uttar pradesh.you spoke of uttar pradesh. mr prime minister, elections will be held in uttar pradesh in 6,7,8 months. the focus of entire nation will be on it. you are the mp from varanasi. but some comments are made by bjp, some say sangh parivar, some independent groups, communal colour is added to it and not just from one party but from other parties as well. mr prime minister are you going to be able to keep development as the sole agenda? the main issue in the uttar pradesh polls should be that of development, it shouldn't get capsized, the focus shouldn't be elsewhere. are you confident that communal agenda will not overpower development?it's my conviction, it's my commitment. you must have seen during the 2014 elections that i fought elections on the issue of development. the new generation of the country only believes in development. i believe that solution to all problems is in development. development is also the solution to the tension that people talk about. if we provide employment to people, if we ensure there's food on their plates, if we provide them with facilities and give them education, all the tension will end. and this is why, all those who want good for the nation, i request them to compete towards development and for development. this atmosphere should be created in the country and i think such an environment is being created nowadays.so the hot heads who make extreme comments, is there a necessity to control them? so that there is no politics in the name of religionfirstly, i am of the firm belief that the nation should progress on the issue of development. and it is necessary that the country moves forward on the issue of development. i would like to tell the media not to make heroes out of those people who make such comments.but they keep making such commentsdon't make them heroes, they will stopwe don't make them heroes, we make them villains.but why do you make them so big? i see such statements by people on tv, whose faces i haven't even seen and they end up becoming spokesmen on tvself styled spokesmeni don't know why such people are encouragedmr prime minister, let's talk in 2016 of the 2017 elections. after delhi, then bihar, then assam, west bengal. after that we will talk about punjab. before we finish talking about punjab, we will talk about uttar pradesh. then there is the gujarat state election. don't you think that this country is permanently stuck in an electoral cycle? the focus constantly and i want you to reflect on this issue, the focus is on party politics, polarising issues, not on governance. we are a country, if we say, we are constantly in a political campaign mode. is this a good thing? should we break away from it? and what is your view on it?see this is not an issue about narendra modi or the prime minister. and also it is not an issue about a particular party or a particular government.but before the last parliament session, the speaker had called all the parties for a meal. after the agenda meeting everyone was sitting to eat. i had also reached at the same time. while talking casually over food, almost people from all parties said that the central and state elections must be held together. everyone said it. after that during the farewell function of the rajya sabha mps, people from different parties were talking with each other. one of the leaders said, modiji do anything but get us out of this cycle of electionswas that leader from your party?no, he was not from my party. so i said that discussion should happen. what is wrong in that? then one day i said that this was being talked about. this issue has also been discussed in a parliamentary committee. this work has also been started by the election commission and i think they have also writen a letter on it. like in the fight against black money, this issue of elections also gets connected to black money. electoral reforms are necessary if the country has to be rid of black money. it is one of the areas for electoral reforms. i believe that the prime minister cannot take a decision on this and nor should he do that. neither the government can do this. there should be a broad discussion on this and we should not run away from the debate on this continious cycle of elections. the indian voter today is very mature. he votes in one fashion in the lok sabha elections, he votes in a different manner in the state assembly elections. we have seen this. in 2014, the general elections conincided with the odisha assembly elections. the same electorate gave one judgement for odisha and another judgement for delhi. so this country's voter is very mature and we should trust his maturity. there should be a debate on how costs can be reduced by holding simultaneous elections, how the influence of black money can be curbed, how the five years can be spent in taking the country forward. today due to the model code of conduct, there is a loss even in those areas where the code is not applicable. when i was in gujarat, i found that at least 80 to 90 officers were spending two to three months on election duties in other states. this could be happening in every state. so this is an area of concern and some time or the other this question will have to be thought of. i would want the election commission to take this debate forward. they should invite all political parties and hold discussions with everybody and whatever comes out of itcan there be a timebound resolution in this?the election commission will have to invite all political parties to discuss this. the process will get derailed if one party were to initiate thisare you willing to take the lead in building that consensus?despite being the prime minister, i still belong to a political party. the better thing would be for the election commission to initiate this. today the election commission is a very prestigious institution in our country. every political party believes in the election commission and it will further empower this institution and that will be betteri think it is an interesting idea of simultaneous elections. though state parties, regional parties may feel that it will effect them badly. that the national parties like the bjp will gainodisha is the best example. odisha is the best example. in 2014, the bjp had no advantage in the state but the bjp won on the lok sabha seats. this shows the differencemr prime minister how are you keeping your schedule nowadays? i mean you keep a terrifying pace. the number of meetings you hold, people say your officers find it hard to keep upit is not so, it has been 2 years now and everyone is used to the work. i believe that it is such a big country that one must do as much work as possible. so i keep doing thatbefore i come to my last question mr prime minister, one issue that i want to come to is the farmers' crisis. as you are well aware, there has been a crisis in this country, you referred to it. in that speech to your mps, about which i asked you earlier as well, on 20th may in the central hall of parliament you said that 'this government is not for myself, this government is for the poor, we must do something for them.' the farmers' crisis mr prime minster is a reality. i am glad that in this interview you have not avoided the reality, you've faced it, you've talked about it. we have linked our entire future to the monsoons. how do we overcome this from becoming an annual crisis in this country?we will have to put stress on water management here. you must have seen that under the pradhan mantri krishi sinchayi yojana, we have put stress on water issues. during these drought days, i met leaders from 11 states separately and sat with them for about 2-3 hours each. the country would have believed that their prime minister is working even if i had held a meeting with 11 of them together for around 10 minutes. but i didn't do that. i sat with leaders from different states separately to understand specific problems and what we could do for water in those states. i am happy, whichever party the state government affiliated to, all the governments focused a lot on water issues this summer. we will reap its benefits this monsoon. using scientific methods for water accumulation and irrigation, collecting water and directing them towards the fields, everyone did that. micro irrigation is stressed upon. even for sugarcane farming, farmers are slowly moving towards micro irrigation which earlier happened through flood irrigation. paddy crops for which large amount of water is used. today, farmers have started using drip irrigation for it. if we do well in water facilities, then one of the problems is solved. after independence, for the first time, we have brought in pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana which can cover maximum number of farmers. the farmer will have to pay only 2%, only 2%, the government will take care of the rest. the farmers will get an assurance. for instance, in maharashtra, the monsoons are expected in the month of june, the farmers have prepared for everything but haven't started with the sowing process. now if there are no rains till august, so practically his crops have not been damaged, because he did not sow the seeds. but the pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana even takes this into consideration and benefits the farmer. another important aspect, once the crops are harvested, they're cut and kept in the field, assuming it has been a good year for crop growth, with 100% crop production, but it hasn't been loaded on trucks and sent to the market yet. and if it rains, even after 15 days of harvesting, if there is loss, it is covered under pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana. second layer of protection, minimum premium with maximum cover. after independence, for the first time, we have brought in pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana. thirdly, first time we have brought in e-mandi concept. farmer in the village, can sell the crops to the best markets in the country through his mobile phone. farmer would set the price at which the crop would be sold. earlier, farmers used to take the produce on carts or tractors, used to go to a mandi 20-25kms away, then due to storage issues, even if they had to sell for rs 10 less than the price, they used to sell it. now, sitting at home the farmer would know what price to sell the crops at. next point is about, food processing, value addition. we opened up 100% foreign direct investment in food processing. for example, if a farmer is selling tomatoes and if a company is processing tomato ketchup then my farmers would benefit from it. the companies that make aerated drinks, coca-cola, pepsi etc, i requested them to add 5% natural fruit juice. in regions near nagpur and vidarbha where oranges are cultivated, coca-cola is going to add 5% of orange juice. if we add 5% natural juice to aerated water, farmers would get their market and their fruits wouldn't go waste. we should have a comprehensive all-out scheme. so much of our land has been damaged. we have brought in soil health card. we have a soil health abhiyan. the farmer will know the feritility of the land through it. whether a fertilizer needs to be used or not, the farmer will understand. on an average, a farmer with 1 hectare of land will be able to save rs 15000-20000. so we have brought in scientific methods. you would know that in our country, farmers used to be lathicharged when they would go to buy urea and they had to buy it in black. we got urea 100% neem coated. earlier, urea used to go to chemical factories, and the government subsidies were stolen in the name of farmers. after neem coating, urea cannot be used for any other purpose except farming. because of neem coating, there is a qualitative change which helps in healing the damaged land. due to neem coating a piece of land that used 10 kgs of urea can now manage with 7 kgs of urea. all these initiatives are in the direction of agriculture and the results will be seen soon.do you think that the farmers' crisis will be resolved, the question i asked, that it won't be an annual affair, the dependence on monsoons will go down?see agriculture is a state subject. the indian government has taken initiatives, if the state government are enthusiastic to implement this, which i think they will be. as i told you i met leaders from different states and they worked a lot for water issues. if this works, pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana has direct involvement of the central government, it will have great benefits.mr prime minister now i have two questions for you.this has become too long.i'll club these two (questions) together. you're also enjoying it and i am glad you're speaking mr prime minister because there is so much ground to cover and i think viewers would like to hear your view, sir. actually there are three, if you allow me. they're short questions. first is that prime minister narendra modi, how much is politics playing on your mind? in the sense that every prime minister, especially someone who is as forthright as you, looks at the next big challenge. is 2019 anywhere in your mind?those who have seen me in gujarat, and those who have seen me in the last two years, those who see me without any bias, they will know that i am an apolitical prime minister. apart from elections, i don't get involved into politics ever. you can call elections a necessity, a restraint or a responsibility, we have to do it. i attend many functions, go to different areas, you wouldn't have heard any political comment from me. if i go to a government function, i talk about government related topics. if i attend a railways function i talk about railways, if water then water, if water bodies, then water bodies. my focus is on governance. country has been at greatest loss because governments were run only for elections. governments must not run only for elections. the government should be a bona fide attempt of meeting the demands and expectations of the common people. elections should just be a bi-product. it is a democracy. winning and losing is a part of it. it shouldn't be hyped. you would have seen recently i urged everyone to pay taxes before 30th september. i even said it on mann ki baat yesterday. will a person, who is only concerned with winning elections, say that post 30th september you'd face problems?this was also a warning in a way.it is a warning. it is definitely a warning. it is a warning. my first warning is to my government officers to not presume citizens as thieves. i have already given this warning. i have handled my officers first. it took me quite some time. you will be shocked to hear that i have given an early retirement to more than 30 people from income tax department on integrity issues. this isn't a small issue. people who weren't transferred since 20 years, i got them transferred. so, one, my focus is on my system. second, i also tell the country, that for the poor of the nation we would have to give out something for the poor in our country. it is my responsibility to give the people an account of every rupee. i will use it at right places. i won't let it get stolen. but if i need to give houses to the poor, we would need revenue. i don't want to increase taxes, i just want taxes to be paid honestly. there is no need to increase the taxes. the country can run without troubling the citizens. i am working towards it. that is why i have given the citizens a chance to pay the taxes till 30th september, whatever it is rs 10,000 or rs. 50,000. if they think they want to come into mainstream, they must and shouldn't be worried. after 30th september, the government will have to take steps. i will not worry about the polls. i will take the necessary steps. i want to work for the poor in my country.mister prime minister, do some crystal ball gazing for the next three years. for the next three years, to use the cricketing analogy, how do you find your run rate so far and will you have to score at a higher run rate in the next three years to achieve your targets?see, no matte at what speed i move forward, i am never satisfied. if today i run at a speed of 100, i keep an aim of running at 200. i think that the world that was behind us, has gone ahead. we need to run a lot to match that level. so we do not need to calculate. we just need to give it all in. and i have given myself in completely. i've been successful is pulling my entire government in. i believe that the country is also committed to move forwardfinal question to you mr prime minister, what motivates you the most? first of all as i said, will you be able to keep this pace? what motivates you the most and also if you can share with our viewers honestly what is your one greatest source of worry?firstly, i don't live under the burden of worries. problems and challenges are there, you can't deny that. but you must challenge the challenges and not let the challenges turn into worries. this is my principle. i challenge the challenges. i like to face the problems. i don't run away from them. whatever loss i have to face for it, i face it. but i can't leave the country helpless. this responsibility must be taken and i will continue to do so. for all good and bad things, it is my responsibility. i do not regret anything. i believe, people of the country have given me the responsibility and i must fulfill it. thirdly, when i see the poor in our country, it reminds me of the work that i have to do for them. day before yesterday, i was in pune, and met a shrimaan chandrakant ji. a retired teacher with a pension of rs 16000, donates rs 5000 every month for swachh abhiyaan. if a 70 year old retired teacher with children and family at home, without worrying about them, worries about the country, then being the prime minister, i should work a thousand times more than chandrakant ji. this is my inspiration. people of this country who work day and night, they are my inspiration. i look at them and i work even harder.prime minister narendra modi it has been a privilege. i am grateful for this interview.thank youand thank you on behalf of all our viewers that you spoke frankly. the program is frankly speaking and i am thankful to you that you were so frank.i just request you to not create controversies out of this but instead use it for the benefit of the country.please do not think like that. thank you very muchthanks a lot. thank you very much."
58f51d917be9e01a17c92e8f,New cotton seed can resist whitefly: NBRI,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/New-cotton-seed-can-resist-whitefly-NBRI/articleshow/54041475.cms,2016-09-07,,The Times Of India,"CHANDIGARH: Lucknow-based National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI) has become the first institute in the world to isolate an anti-whitefly gene (designated as Tma12) from a fern. This should please cotton farmers in Punjab and Haryana, one of the worst hit by the pest attack over the past couple of years.A team of NBRI researchers led by senior scientist P K Singh has even introduced it into cotton and successfully completed its trial for three years and over six generations, thus proving its efficacy. This means farmers will get whitefly-resistant cotton seed in the next five years.""The process of transferring the technology to Punjab Agriculture University (PAU) in Ludhiana is on. We are taking legal advice and both the institutions have started seeking permission from the Union government's Review Committee of Genetic Manipulation (RCGM). There is no monetary transaction involved and we hope to be able to transfer the seeds to PAU by January,"" says Singh.Last year, the whitefly outbreak caused devastation of cotton crop in 1.5 million hectares in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. The revenue loss to farmers was estimated to be Rs 10,000 crore, despite the use of pesticides worth Rs 500 crore.""Around September last year, I wrote to the Punjab chief minister, chief secretary and several other people. PAU vice-chancellor Baldev Singh Dhillon responded. In November a team from PAU visited NBRI and studied our research,"" Singh adds.Though, farmers in Punjab and Haryana will have to wait for five years before they can start buying the seed, this is the first clear long-term solution to have emerged in a long time. ""There is no GM technology available for the control of whitefly in world. India, Pakistan, Israel, Brazil, Argentina, USA, China and Australia are affected by whitefly. This insect also wreaks havoc in African countries. The major affected crops are cotton, tomato, brinjal, capsicum, chilli, cucumber, other vegetables and a few legumes,"" says Singh.""The study was initiated in 2007 and we developed whitefly resistant GM cotton in 2012. A paper was submitted to top global journal, Nature Biotechnology, for publication in September 2015.

Here is the complete transcript of thewith Arnab Goswami.Prime Minister Modi thank you very much for this interview. Thank you very muchMy greetings to all the peopleThis is your first one to one interview to a private news channel since you became Prime Minister. And if I am not mistaken, this is the first ever interview by a sitting Prime Minister of India to a private television news channel in the country. So I would first like to thank you and am very grateful for the opportunity.The world of the media has grown so big that everybody has to attach themselves with it.I am very grateful and our viewers will be very grateful also Mr Modi because they want to hear your views on a range of subjects. Mr Prime Minister I would like to start by taking you back to 20th May 2014. The results came on May 16th. Four days later, you gave a historic speech in the Central Hall of Parliament and you were speaking to the members of Parliament. You had said four days after the results that an era of responsibility has begun. And that you said that in 2019 before the elections, I will come back to this Parliament, I will come back to the MPs and I will give my report card. Forty percent into your tenure, how much have you achieved of your own targets?When I went for the first time as an MP to the Central Hall, and it was the first time I was seeing the Central Hall. I had not been there before. So I had then said that becoming the Prime Minister was not about the designation of the office but it was about the responsibilities and work of being a PM. I had also said that my government would be committed to the poor. I was completely new in the job. Delhi was new for me. The Delhi environment was new to me. The work of the government of India was also new for me. But despite that, in such a short time, the pace at which the country has moved forward, and it's not on one subject. You can pick up any aspect of the government's functioning, and if you make a comparison with the past governments, then you will realize that no issue has been ignored. There has been an effort to bring in something new in every area. There is an effort to bring in change in every area. One big challenge was that I was not experienced about this place, I had not even been an MP. The office was new, the questions were also new. But when I look at the second biggest challenge, we should remember those days when the country was engulfed in disappointment. The everyday news was about whether there would be any electricity production after seven days, whether coal would be supplied or not. This was the situation then. The entire system was engulfed in disappointment. The big challenge was to inject new trust into the system and create confidence among the citizens. It is very difficult to evaluate this from the outside but I have gone through it. But today I can say with a lot of satisfaction that now there is no trace of any disappointment. The intention to do something is visible. And it's not in words but in actual achievement. I had said that within a given timeframe, we will open bank accounts for the poor. For something that had not been done for 60 years, setting a timeframe for it was in itself a risk. But because of that a trust was created in the system that it was something doable. So that's the process I started for awakening the confidence. And today you can see that in every sector, the changed circumstances can be seen. While evaluating the performance of this government, never forget that you will have to make that evaluation in comparison with the 10 years of the previous government. Only then will you know where we were and where we are now. We should not be talking about what we are aiming for. For now you will have to assess the present in comparison with the immediate past and in that you will find a bright futureMr. Modi, I want to start now on the issue of foreign policy. In the area of foreign policy, you have taken great personal interest. The amount of personal interest you have shown in foreign policy, probably none of the previous Prime Ministers showed the same kind of interest. Your approach is pro active. What I find interesting about your foreign policy is that you have balanced different powers and different interests. On the one side, your relationship with US, you made sure that India enters the Missile Control Technology Regime with them. A week before that you also signed the historic Chabahar Port Agreement with Iran. So, you have balanced very diverse forces. My question to you over this is that, is it easy to do that as an Indian Prime Minister? Secondly, on the issue of the NSG, you staked a lot of personal interest, personal push, you lobbied actively. How close are we to getting the NSG seat?Firstly, about foreign policy, you need to know what has strengthened our foreign policy. For 30 years, in our country, the government was unstable. For 30 years, party with a clear mandate wasn't given the opportunity to form the government. The world measures the government of a nation on the basis of its condition in its own country, on how strong their word is in their own country. I am thankful to the people of this country, that after 30 years, they chose a government with absolute majority and this has had an impact on world politics. Countries and world leaders have changed their perspective towards India. This is the biggest benefit. Secondly, the world didn't know me. The world wants to know who the head of the state is. If someone would want to know Modi through the eyes of the media, then he would be disillusioned on which modi is the real Modi. If this happens, the country will be at a loss. Modi's personality shouldn't be a hindrance for the world to have faith in india. But for that unless I meet all those leaders and engage them them one to one, unless I speak to them frankly, they wouldn't know about india's head of state, so it was very important for me as I am not from a political family. I never had the opportunity to meet the world leaders earlier.You were an unknown entity in foreign policyMore than foreign policy it was foreign relations. Yes, I was new to it. So for me, being pro active was mandatory. Thirdly, we work as a team. Foreign ministry, Prime Minister's officer, commerce ministry, finance ministry, defense minister, everyone works as a team, not as separate pieces. The impact that is now visible, is not just because of Modi, it is because of the team. All teams work in a particular direction. That is why the impact is seen, earlier these teams were splintered. We have seen instances where the party would give a statement, the prime minister would say something else, party leaders would say something else. This disunity has had a negative impact. Thirdly, we also need to understand that earlier the world was bi polar. Foreign policy would be centered around two super powers. India was a little late in realizing that this bi polar situation was for namesake. Now the entire world, in changed circumstances, especially in 21st century, it is more interdependent and inter connected, earlier, the foreign policy was possible between governments, but today it is not possible just between governments. Government relations are important but increasing people to people contact is equally important. There's been a shift in paradigm. Because I do not have any previous baggage, because I've had a clean slate, I write everything from beginning and that has a benefit. Today we are building relations with countries across the world. The amount of respect with which I engage saudi arabia, I engage Iran with the same amount of respect. The amount of respect with which I speak to America, I speak to russia with the same amount of respect. So we need to understand this. We also need to understand that we shouldn't consider smaller countries insignificant. I abide by this principle. The small countries of the world are as important as the big nations. We had assumed that the relations with smaller nations would develop under the shadow of the bigger nations. I brought about a change in this. You must have seen that I made a forum for the pacific island nations. We have had two meetings. I went there once and they came here once. These are small countries with a population of about 10 lakh or 20 lakh. But these small island nations are most affected by global warming. When india took up the international solar mission and 122 nations joined it, the island nations benefitted the most out of it. They are 50 in number now. A group of 50 nations, feels secured with this vision of India. If we try to understand this change, then we would realize that in the world, a few days back, I was sitting with the officers of our foreign services, so as we got talking, in a very poetic way I told them that there was a time when we used to sit by the sea and count the waves, but the time has now changed, we are done counting waves, now it's time for us to steer ourselves, ride the waves and decide on our direction, destination and speedThat is apparent. You have a very aggressive foreign policy. But my second question was, you put so much effort for NSG membership. My question was, how close are we to NSG membership and were you disappointed that we did not make it at the very end because of China's opposition?Look the first thing is that India has been continuously making these efforts, no matter which government was in office. Be it the membership of the UN Security Council or the SCO membership or MTCR membership or NSG membership. Every government has made an effort. It's not that only this government is trying, it's in continuity. But it's during our tenure that we achieved SCO membership, we also got the MTCR membership. I have full faith that now we have begun a coordinated effort for the NSG membership too. The process has begun on a positive note. Everything has rules and will work accordingly and move forwardIs it the problem of mindset with China? There have been 13 engagements at various levels between the Narendra Modi government and the Chinese government. The latest engagement was when you went to Tashkent. You spent some time with the Chinese President Xi Jinping. Yet it was seen that in the case of Masood Azhar, China blocked India's UN bid to ban him. Now they have stalled India's NSG bid. Why is China repeatedly blocking us Mr Prime Minister despite your personal proactive measures and your government's outreach?The first thing is that we have an ongoing dialogue with China and it should continue to happen. In foreign policy it's not necessary to have similar views to have a conversation. Even when the views are contradictory, talks are the only way forward and problems should be resolved through dialogue. We don't have one problem with China, we have a whole lot of problems pending with China. Slowly and steadily, an effort is on to address these issues through talks and make them less cumbersome. I can say that China has been cooperating with India to search for solutions. On some issues, it's a question of principles for them. On some issues, it's a question of principles for us. On some issues they differ with us and there are issues on which we differ with them. There are some basic differences. But the most important thing is that we can speak to China eye-to-eye and put forth India's interests in the most unambiguous manner. We are a government that takes care of India's interests. We don't compromise on this. Three days ago I met the Chinese President. I told him clearly about India's interests. They are a different country, we are a different countryDo you think you will be able to change their mindset on the issue of NSG membership?See the foreign policy is not about changing mindsets. Foreign policy is about finding the common meeting points. Where do our interests converge and how much? We have to sit and talk with every country. It's our ongoing effortThis statement that you just made is also apt in the context of America where you gave a speech in the U.S Congress. By the way Mr Prime Minister it was a fantastic speechThank youThere was a lot of humour. You were laughing and cracking jokes while you delivered the speech which was very unique. They also appreciated it. Was the speech impromptu?I have a humourous side but these days humour can be a risky thingWhy do you say that?In this era of 24/7 news channels, anybody can lift a small word and make a big issue out of it. But I will tell you the truth, the reason for the absence of humour in public life is this fear. I am myself scared . Earlier when I used to make speeches, I would make it so humourous but there would never be any issuesHave you become more conscious now?I am not conscious. I am in fear, there is no humour left in public life because of this fear. Everyone is scared. I am in fear. My speeches used be humourous. I see it in Parliament, that humour is finished there too. It is a matter of concern. I will quote one proverb.Yes, go ahead.Even if you mention a proverb, they will connect it with something else and begin a conversation. The one who is saying the proverb does not know for what he is speaking.But you should not lose your sense of humour Mr Prime MinisterBut it is true that my trip to the United States of America, my speech in their Congress and the respect shown towards India created a lot of hype. Had it not been hyped so much, there would not have been so much criticism on the NSG issue. Government is being criticized not for any mishandling of the NSG issue but because we were so successful over there (in the USA)Did China become conscious of your growing friendship with US?I am talking about what's happening hereBut when you delivered that speech in context of America, you used a very interesting phrase. You said 'We have to overcome the hesitations of history'. My Hindi is not that good. Like hesitations of history. But my question to you is Mr Prime Minister, how close can we get to America because many Indians believe that America is still supporting Pakistan, giving them military assistance. How close can we get? At what point do we stop before we are seen like an American ally? What is your own world view on that?I would especially like to appeal to my country's media that we should stop looking at everything in India from the. India is an independent country. It is a country of 125 crore people. Whenever it approaches any country, it will only be concerned about its own interests. It has been our biggest shortcoming and mistake that we have been tagging ourselves with another country and trying to do things. We are an independent country, we have our own policies and future. We have to think about the future of our 125 crore people. There should be no compromise on our interests. We have relations with America in the context of these fundamental pointsHow close can we get to them?There has been warmth in our relationship. You must have seen the editorials in American newspapers after my visit to that country. One point mentioned in those editorials was that the success of Obama's foreign policy has been the warm relationship with India. This has been saidWhat you are saying Modiji is that we can be close to America but we need not be an ally or seen to be an ally?The first thing is that we no longer live in a bipolar world. The world is interconnected and interdependent. You will have to connect with everybody at the same time. Even if there are two opposing countries, they will have to be friends. Now the times have changedMr Modi, on 8th May 2014, I had the opportunity to interview you, the interview took place in Ahmedabad, I think one last phase of elections was left. We were discussing the issue of Pakistan. You have had an uncompromising approach towards Pakistan. Two days back, Lashkar E Toiba killed 8 CRPF jawans in an attack. In the 8th May interview, you put forth a very interesting phrase, you said 'Can talks be heard amidst the noise of bombs, guns and pistols?' This is how you had phrased it. Do you believe we have been too generous towards Pakistan? Do you believe we have been too generous towards Pakistan?There are two things. One - India has always wanted friendly ties with its neighbours, there can be no debate around it. We want to live in harmony and peace. And I have said it repeatedly, that India has to fight poverty, Pakistan too has to fight poverty, why don't we come together to fight poverty? I said this before elections and during election campaigns. Also I had invited leaders of SAARC nations to my swearing in ceremony and they had attended it as well. So there has been no change in our intent, our thoughts and our current behaviour. Number two - those who have to work from the table, will work from the table and those who have to work at the border, will work at border with full strength. Each one will fulfill the responsibility entrusted to them. And our jawans are fulfilling their responsibilities. It's true that pressure on terrorists has increased, their schemes are proving unsuccessful. The intent with which they move forward are foiled and they have to face major challenges. It is because of this disappointment that such incidents are taking place and our jawans are risking their lives and protecting the country. We are very proud of our JawansWhen your foreign policy is studied, observers analyze what's happening and what's not happening. If you give me the opportunity, I want to do a bit of analyses. There was a terrific pace of engagement with Pakistan between October, November and December. On 30th November, you met Nawaz Sharif on the sidelines (of UN Climate Summit in Paris). Both of you were seated on a sofa, talking to each other. A lot of people were speculating the contents of your conversation. This was on the sidelines of Climate Summit. After that, all of a sudden within seven days there were NSA level talks and Ajit Doval spoke to Nasir Janjua in Bangkok. And again after that you went to Russia via Afghanistan, you made an unexpected visit to Nawaz Sharif in Lahore. It was a personal trip but it still had some level of importance. Eight days later, Pakistani terrorists attacked Pathankot. Can you tell our viewers whether Pakistan was proactively responding in the months of October, November and December? Did the Pathankot terror attack change the situation? Is it true that Pakistan was making a lot of movement in those three months?Look there are different types of forces operating in Pakistan. But the government only engages with a democratically elected system. Our effort for that engagement is continuing. But our supreme objective is peace. Our supreme objective is to protect India's interests. We keep making effort toward that objective and sometimes our efforts are successful. As far as meetings and talks are concerned, we signalled right from the day I took oath and sent invitations for the oath taking ceremony, that we seek friendly relations but without compromising on our interests. And that is why I have said that my country's soldiers have full freedom to answer back in whatever manner they have to and they will keep doing thatMr Prime Minister what is the 'Lakshman Rekha' that you would draw when it comes to Pakistan. There is some confusion surrounding this subject. I would like you to give an elaborate reply. In 2014, it was believed that if talks are being held, then they should be held between two countries and not with Hurriyat. It should be between the government of India and the government of Pakistan. The other 'Lakshman Rekha' is that you must act on 26/11. There's been no forward movement so far. The third thing is about forward movement on the Pathankot attack case. So what is the 'Lakshman Rekha' now and if Pakistan remains within those bounds, so talks can happen at the political level or at any other level?The first thing is that with Pakistan, to whom do we talk to decide about the 'Lakshman Rekha'. Will it be with the elected government or with other actors? That is why India will have to be on alert all the time. India will have to be alert every moment. There can never be any laxity in this. But there is an outcome due to my continuous efforts like my visit to Lahore and my invitation to the Pakistani Prime Minister to come to India. Now I don't have to explain to the world about India's position. The world is unanimously appreciating India's position. And the world is seeing that Pakistan is finding it difficult to respond. If we had become an obstacle, then we would have had to explain to the world that we are not that obstacle. Now we don't have to explain to the world. The world knows our intentions. Like on the issue of terrorism, the world never bought India's theory on terrorism. They would sometime dismiss it by saying that it's your law and order problem. Today the world has to accept what India has been saying about terrorism. India's dialogue on terrorism, the losses India has suffered due to terrorism, the losses suffered by humanity, the world is now acknowledging that. So I believe we have to take this process forwardMr Prime Minister I now want to move to questions on the economy. In the past two years you have started many schemes. If we look at the theme of Jan Dhan Yojna for financial inclusion, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna for crop insurance, Swach Bharat, Skill India, Make In India. If we see the theme running through these schemes, is your social agenda at the core of your personal economic philosophy, social transformation? Is the social agenda at the core of your economic philosophy as the Prime Minister?The first point is our philosophy is to reach the last man in the line. Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay's philosophy forms the core of our political, economic and social ideology. And even Mahatma Gandhi used to say that what is there for the last man? So my development parameter is very simple. It is about how the poorest of the poor can benefit from development. The poor is the central focus of my economic agenda. The poor should be strengthened in such a way that they get the willingness to defeat poverty. By helping the poor make ends meet while they remain in poverty is also one of the ways. I am not saying right or wrong but it's one of the ways. But today the country's situation is such that we should make the poor strong so that they become partners in defeating poverty. All these schemes are meant to empower the poor and change the quality of life. The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna is not only about opening bank accounts for the poor. Because of this the poor are feeling that they are becoming a part of the country's economic system. The bank that he was seeing from afar, now he is able to enter that bank. This brings about a psychological transformation. Looked at in another way, did you ever imagine that 40 thousand crores could be injected into the banking system by contributions from the poor. The poor who never had bank accounts, have deposited 100 rupees, 50 rupees or 200 rupees. It means that poor man saved 100 rupees and the change began in his life. We have taken up construction of toilets. I had gone to Chhattisgarh and had the opportunity to get the blessings of one mother. An adivasi mother heard about the scheme for building toilets. She sold her four goats and built a toilet. That 90 old mother uses a walking stick and goes around the cluster of 30 or 40 houses in the tribal village and has been spreading the message to build toilets. This change is becoming the reason for the change in the quality of life. I have begun the cleanliness campaign. It's estimated an individual spends an average of 7000 rupees for treatment of a disease. The main reason for disease is filth. The poor suffer the most from the filth. If a poor man falls sick, he cannot drive his rickshaw for two days and his children go hungry. So how can we help the poor bring about change in their lives? Now there is a neo-middle class and a middle class in the country. The young have their aspirations. So another aspect of my policies you must have seen are the Start Up India, Stand Up India, Seaport activity, port activity, railways expansion, railway station upgradation. These changes directly appeal to the middle class. The middle class has its aspirations. We have to create jobs? How will job creation happen? Till I invest in the development of infrastructure, there be no job creation. You must have seen that the maximum electricity generation since Independence has occurred this year. The maximum amount of coal mined has been in this year. The maximum length of roads being constructed daily is happening in this year. The fastest loading and unloading of steamers at sea ports is happening now. All these changes are creating opportunities for employment like in Start up India, Stand Up India. For instance in Stand Up India, I have said that every bank should give an economic opportunity to one woman, one dalit or one tribal person to become entrepreneurs. This will create many job opportunities. So this is the basis of my economic philosophy.Mr Prime Minister if I could interrupt you on this. On the one hand is the people's expectations and on the other is your vision. Many programs that you have mentioned, you can't put a calendar date to it but they don't have an immediate impact. They maybe able to show results in 3, 4, 5 maybe beyond 5 years. Now there are challenges in that. Mr Prime Minister, you are aware more than anyone else that people want immediate results. Now you spoke of job creation. The first thing, as an achievement you have managed to grow the economy at 7.5 per cent when the global economic climate is very bleak. You have spoken about it as well. You have met fiscal deficit targets, FDI inflows have increased but people are saying that job opportunities are not increasing. You have spoken about infrastructure but the current rate of unemployment. Mr Prime Minister, the latest Labour Bureau figures, is it a source of concern for you as the Prime Minister?The first thing is that are 800 million people below the age of 35 in our country. We have to accept that the demand for jobs is very high. But where will they get employment? Investment will come in. It will be used in the infrastructure sector, manufacturing and services sector. Now like the initiative we have taken, we have started the Mudra Yojna. More than three crore people in the country comprise washermen, barbers, milkman, newspaper vendors, cart vendors. We have given them nearly 1.25 lakh crore rupees without any guarantee. Now why have these people taken the money? To expand their work. When he expands his work, if he is currently employing one person, now he has to employ two people. If there were two employed earlier, now there are three. Now just think, when 3 crore of these small businesses have got access to finance, they must have expanded their work. Now all this is not in the Labour Department's registration. Three crore people have expanded their work. We took another small decision. The big malls in the country run 365 days a year but the smaller shops have to close on holidays. We announced in the Budget that even a small shopkeeper can operate his shop till late night and that too on all the seven days of the week. If the malls don't have restrictions then why should the small shopkeepers have restrictions. So now if a shopkeeper operates his shop till late and on all seven days, if he earlier employed one person, now he will have to employ two people. So won't the employment increase?So is your focus on entrepreneurship?Our focus is on all aspects. Now we are saying that by 2022 we want to ensure that everyone has a house. Housing sector has the maximum potential for creating employment. Houses will be built in such huge numbers, how many people will get employment? You must have seen that last year we brought in a textile policy. Under this textile policy, there will be income tax benefits for those who create employment. The more employment one creates, the more tax benefits they will get. For the first time, employment generation and tax has been linked. These are the things that boost employment and our central focus is creating employment for the ordinary citizenMr Prime Minister, questions are also being raised on food inflation which has still not decreased. The expectation was that the food inflation would decline. The people had put their hopes on the Prime Minister that you will bring down prices. This not only has a political impact but also has a social impact. Over the past two weeks, there were reports that in some places the price of Arhar dal had touched 150 rupees and 200 rupees for other pulses. The price of tomatoes was also rising. Is this only seasonal because the food inflation is increasing at 7.5 per cent year on year. Global oil prices have fallen. Do you think this creates perception issues for your government?You can't view inflation as a perception issue. Price rise should be seen as a reality. What is available for a consumer should be seen for what it is. There should never be an attempt to view price rise as a perception issue as a means of escaping the reality of price rise. We will have to accept reality. You see the fast pace at which prices were rising under the previous government, today that speed has decelerated a lot. You can see the statistics, you will find it there. Second, the country has gone through two consecutive years of severe drought. Drought has a direct impact on the price of vegetables, food and pulses because all these things are produced from the soil. Now when there is such a big drought, it's not in anybody's hands. The second option in such a situation is imports. The Indian government has imported pulses in huge quantities. Third, it is the joint responsibility of the state and Central governments. It is not exclusively the state's responsibility. It is not exclusively the Centre's responsibility. It is the joint responsibility of both the state and Central governments. This should not be an issue of blame game that the state government did not do certain things and that the Centre did not do certain things. But it will have to be agreed that it is the joint responsibility of both. That is why the Centre has given rights to the states to make stringent laws. How much stocks to keep or not to keep are decisions which the states can take. All these rights have been given to the states. Some states have performed well, some states are trying. But the Centre and state governments are trying to work together on this. I believe that we have been successful to the extent that the speed with which prices were rising (under UPA), what would have happened if the prices were to rise at that speed. We have been successful in stopping that speedy rise of prices. But as far as pulses are concerned, production in India has been very low. Many farmers who were earlier sowing pulses have started cultivating sugar. That is also an area of concern. We gave special incentives for pulses. We have tried to set up a different MSP for pulses. We have taken steps to procure pulses from farmers with bonus. Our focus is on increasing the production of pulses. We are also focusing on building stocks of pulses by importing from abroad. An all out effort is being made and I believe that nobody doubts the sincerity of this governmentMr Prime Minister what is your view about the controversy around the exit of Raghuram Rajan as the RBI Governor? A lot has been spoken about this. There was commentary that it may effect India's image, perception as a global economy. What's your own view of the controversy around the exit of Raghuram Rajan?When my Government was formed in May 2014, you take newspapers from May, June, July 2014 and check television debates during that period. The topic of the television debates would be - Will the new govt let Raghuram Rajan continue? Or Will the new Government oust Raghuram Rajan? And there was more or less consensus that he was appointed by the previous govt and so Modi won't let him complete his tenure and will remove him. You have seen, that he worked his entire tenure. For the time he was appointed by the previous government, he completing his entire term. So all the misconceptions have been dispelled. Secondly, according to my 2 year experience in Govt, those who are creating controversies, are being unjust to Raghuram RajanWhy so?I will tell you. Those who say...I believe Raghuram Rajan's patriotism is no less than any of ours. It will be doing injustice to him if one says that he will serve the country only if he is at a particular post. As much as I know Raghuram Rajan, whatever post he holds, wherever he is, he is someone who will continue to serve the country. He is someone who loves his country. Therefore, it's not like the nation won't get Raghuram Rajan's services, Raghuram Rajan is not that kind of a person. He is a person who loves the country. Those who speak such language are doing great injustice to him. My experience with him has been good.I appreciate the work he has done. And my good wishes will always be with himPrime Minister Modi, there's a question related to this. During your speech at the Executive you used seven words begining with letter 'S'-- 'Sevabhaav' (service), 'Santulan' (balance), 'Sanyam' (restraint), 'Samvaad' (dialogue), 'Samanvay' (coordination), 'Sakaratmak' (positivity) and 'Samvedna' (sensitivity). I will ask the question in context with Raghuram Rajan because you used these words in the speech at National Executive Meet speech on June 14 in Allahabad. You said, 'Our party leaders and party workers should use these qualities in their daily dealings and behaviour.' Prime Minister, in Raghuram Rajan's context, your Rajya Sabha MP has made many comments. Later he made critical remarks against senior bureaucrats. My question is, do you think it is right? When we talk about 'Sanyam' (restraint) and 'Santulan' (balance), is it correct?Whether it is someone from my party or not, I believe that such things are inappropriate. The nation won't benefit from such publicity stunts. One should be more responsible while conducting themselves. Anyone who believes he is bigger than the system is wrong.That's a very clear message.I have a very clear message. I have no two minds about it.And Mr Prime Minister, if I may say so, between May 8 and now, you are speaking as straight as you did before you took over as Prime Minister. I think that answer takes me to the next subject. Mr Prime Minister, the issue is that of Black Money. In a very interersting way you said, prices should not be looked at from the point of percepetion, equally, Mr Prime Minister it can be said said that an issue like Black Money should not be looked at in terms of perception, but it is perception forming. There are political debates on this. Experts say that the Black Money economy has shrunk, 10-15% economy has shrunk through land dealings and other things. You have passed the Black Money Bill, you have made taxation more transparent, you have started information sharing with other countries, you have taken steps, but Prime Minister Modi, people still expect that a Rs 25 lakh crores will be brought back and put into their bank accounts. How will you address that expectation? The hope that people have taking Black Money, how will you address it?How did the black money issue arise and how did it become such a serious issue? We have to look at the background. It is an established fact in the minds of the common man those who steal money park their money overseas. It's a common perception. Even if I look at it from the common man's perspective, I also wonder where does this money go? This issue was always stalled in the Parliament. When the matter reached the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court ordered Special Investigation Team to look into it, even then the previous government stalled it for three years, from 2011-2014. It's after this that political parties, the media and the common man started believing that there's something wrong. Then the issue of Black Money became an agenda. Even today I can say...that yes, when there is money stashed in foreign accounts, there are some norms of engagement with foreign countries on the issue. But between 2011-2014, these people were given the opportunity to launder money here and thereAnd you also said on 17 February 2015 on this issue, that the then Law Minister is only offering lip serviceThe result was that people got several chances to launder money. Secondly, after our Government was formed, the first decision taken by our Cabinet was to form a Special Investigation Team to bring back Black Money which was pending despite Supreme Court's 2011 order. This shows our sincerity. From then on, you can't imagine how stringent the laws have been made to bring back Black Money and whoever comes in its fold will know how strict the law is. Thirdly, I attended the G20 Summit. Never was Black Money issue discussed in the G20 forum. It was my first G20 summit, for the first time I met the world leaders. And for the first time in the G20 Summit, one paragraph was on unaccounted money, on black money and 20 countries said that the world should cooperateBlack. The dirty money, black money was also linked to terrorism, an environment of global census was created. We have been signing agreements one after the other with different countries that there will be real time, automatic exchange of information with India. I recently visited Switzerland and there was minimal discussion on the issue. But after I returned, a big delegation from Switzerland visited India, and they held meeting with the Indian Government and we discussed...for several years, we believed that Switzerland is the place where black money is stashed, that country is holding discussions to come to a consensus on Automatic Information Exchange and if we reach consensus it will be a great achievement. Thirdly you must've seen that Mauritius route came up in almost everything. It was said that money goes out of India and returns through the Mauritius route. This was discussed. Everyone thought that nothing can be done about the Mauritius route.But our Government held a dialogue with the Mauritius Government, made changes to the old treaty. And we successfully made a new treaty to block the money which comes through the Mauritius route and very soon it will be phased out and completed. All these decisions are taken to fight the Black Money menace. This is not a one sided fight. Secondly, the govt is working in a direction to make sure that Black Money isn't generated in India and black Money doesn't go out of India, you can see the results of all this.When the opposition raises the Rs 15 lakh issue.That is something the opposition raises during elections. Let them have some issue to talk aboutMr Prime Minister, there has been no major financial corruption or scam in your tenure in the last two years. Perception is again, what people say is because you keep a very tight control on the reins of Government but the question is there are people, who are wilful defaulters, the economic offenders who take a lot of money from the country or commit economic offences in the country, go overseas and use rules and use lawyers, and they don't come back to India. And people are asking now, is the Narendra Modi Govt determined to take these cases of wilful defaulters and economic offenders to their logical conclusion.Firstly, this question is not in the minds of people. The people of India have confidence that if there's someone who can do this, it is Narendra Modi and he will do it. Citizens of the country have full faith.Does it worry you, that people have misued the law?I take this as an opportunity and I will show them what the law is.Mr. Modi, there have been several corruption cases about the previous government, which have now come out. There is AgustaWestland, many defense scams and defense transactions are now being analyzed seriously. The cases which were quoted in the CAG reports but were ignored are now coming in the forefront. This question is important because this isn't just about financial corruption but these questions have direct implications on the national security of the country. Do you think, when they say that this is a political witch hunt by Narendra Modi Sarkar, do you think all of these cases would have been possible without political patronage?There are many things which are not visible. One can't imagine the difficulty I am experiencing in taking out things from dirt. One who is working there knows the amount of dirt that exists and how certain things have been caught in a web. There are certain powers behind it. The case about Agusta helicopters. I can't deny it and I believe that we have the right to doubt that people behind this are very experienced. They have perfectly practiced the art of doing wrong deeds. They are very experienced and knowledgeable. And one can also smell the fact that such a thing wouldn't have been done without a shield. Now, agencies are probing. Let's see how far the probe goes. But the investigation shouldn't go ahead while people are being targeted, neither does my government target anyone. The sin has been committed, but how much is done, How was it done, who did it, probe agencies will find out in a professional way. Whatever comes out, will be put outPrime Minister, talking about your speech in the US Congress, and the humour that you displayed. I felt some of it was impromptu. But the Americans were able to relate to what you said, I don't remember the exact words, you said, I am informed that the working of the US Congress is harmonious. And then there was a pause and people were laughing. Then you said, 'I am told' - You emphasized and said 'I am told that you are well known for your bipartisanship.' Then the applause was more. And then you said, 'You are not alone. Time and again I have witnessed a similar spirit in the Indian Parliament.' You spoke about a serious topic in a interesting manner. You referred to the Upper House. There was a lot of response on that too. Your humour was really appreciated and I think it was a wonderful moment when you were speaking. But, Mr. Prime Minister, when you look back at the parliament, this question comes to many people's minds, has Prime Minister Narendra Modi being held back from achieving his own objectives because of the non-stop parliamentary logjam. How much has this affected his moving towards his own targets? If you critically analyze this situation, do you feel your government could have been more consultative or do you feel the blame is entirely with the Opposition?I look at it differently. I believe there have been a lot of problems. Whether the fault is ours or their's, I 'll leave it to the people. People will decide. But because of discussions in Parliament - we may not come to a decision, the decision could be opposing our view, nothing wrong in that. But at least there should be a discussion. The sad part is, if somebody is running away from debate or don't let discussions happen, then it is a cause of worry in a democracy. Whether the government's work is accomplished or not, I don't see it as a cause of worry. If not today, it will happen tomorrow. There are certain things which will happen at an administrative level. The big thing is, Parliament is for discussion. Parliament is to show dissent. Parliament is to give an argument for one's opposition, to present an argument when they support.To uphold this basic spirit of Parliament, is the responsibility of every person who values democracy. It is the responsibility of those present in the Parliament and those outside. It is the responsibility of those in power and those not in power. This is a matter of spirit and it should be followed. As far as the government is concerned, on every issue and at every forum, we have tried to hold discussions. I myself have met the opposition leaders and spoken to them. Key members of the government are also in touch. And you must have seen that many issues have been resolved. In the last session, we have passed 12 bills in Rajya Sabha, we passed 10 bills in the Lok Sabha. So the pace has picked up. When people say 'Opposition', it is unfair to the opposition. There are some parties in the Parliament which are not with the BJP or NDA, but are with the government on key decisions. So, to defame the Opposition by saying that all opposition parties are against us -- when some people do this, it is wrong. There is one party which has problems. And the whole world knows that party. Secondly, to say that 'When you were is Opposition, you did it this way' There is a difference between every Opposition party. 'We have run the government for 60 years and now we are in the Opposition, so we know the nitty-gritties of the government, we know the responsibilities. We can't behave in the way, a new Opposition party behaves.' A party which hasn't been in power or hasn't seen anything, could behave in this way. For example, we are in power now, and consider in 2040 we become the Opposition party. So, in 2040 we can't have the same conduct as the one we had in 2009 or 2010.Congress is a very experienced and old partyThat's why I say that, those who have been in power for so many years, shouldn't be doing this. If there is a new party in the Opposition, they have a small demand for their state or if an MP has a demand for his/her constituency and does something like this, then we can understand. Ones who have been in power for very long, shouldn't be doing such thingsPrime Minister Modi, do you think the GST bill which has been stuck for over one and half years, it is a path-breaking economic reform. It unifies the country. Recently you met Ms Jayalalithaa after she was sworn in as the Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee has extended her support for GST and Congress allies at the state level are supporting the GST bill. Do you feel optimistic that GST bill will be passed in the next session of the Parliament?First we need to understand, that we look at GST only within the purview of an economic reform because of which the right information doesn't come out. Not having GST straight away means loss for the poor of Uttar Pradesh. Absence of GST straight away means loss for the poor people of Bihar. Not passing the GST would mean loss for the poor people of poor states like Bengal, Orissa and Assam. People who sit in the Rajya Sabha must understand this. GST is beneficial for the poor people of the states represented by them, because those states will economically benefit the most from GST. The money will be used for the welfare of the poor people of those states. This is why be it Mamata Banerjee, be it Nitish Kumar, be it Akhilesh Yadav or Naveen Patnaik, all these states want the GST bill to be passed at the earliest. There is just one group which has made it the issue of prestige. Now the kind of arithmetic which is working out, I hope that this decision is passed in favour of the poor. You will be surprised to what extent has the opposition reached to the level of distortion. In the previous session we introduced an act. Indian government has Rs 40,000 crore rupees from the CAMPA Fund. Rs 40,000 crore. we wanted to give that money to the states. States have to use that money for forestry, for greenery, for planting trees and plants. The bill is meant for that. Had this Rs 40,000 crore reached the states before the monsoons, it would have been used for the forests. A lot of people would have got employment, people who plant trees would have been employed. There would be plantation and due to the rains the plants would start growing within a year. But just because of obstructionism, states have been deprived of the benefit of Rs 40,000 crore. The money was meant for the forests and for the tribals. They blocked it. There was no argument on itThe reason...you had triedMade all efforts.You had invited former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi here at the Race Course RoadWe held talks at every levelStill? The word you used 'ego issue', why has it become an ego issue? And people would want to know why is the Prime Minister unable to end this?The Prime Minister cannot answer this question. Those creating obstructions can only answer this question. But despite this, I will keep trying. I am ready to convince them in which ever way possible. If I have to convoke someone over a cup of tea at their house, I am even ready for that. I have no problem. My only aim is the welfare of the poor of my country and the poor of states like Uttar Pradesh.You spoke of Uttar Pradesh. Mr Prime Minister, elections will be held in Uttar Pradesh in 6,7,8 months. The focus of entire nation will be on it. You are the MP from Varanasi. But some comments are made by BJP, some say Sangh Parivar, some independent groups, communal colour is added to it and not just from one party but from other parties as well. Mr Prime Minister are you going to be able to keep development as the sole agenda? The main issue in the Uttar Pradesh polls should be that of development, it shouldn't get capsized, the focus shouldn't be elsewhere. Are you confident that communal agenda will not overpower development?It's my conviction, it's my commitment. You must have seen during the 2014 elections that I fought elections on the issue of development. The new generation of the country only believes in development. I believe that solution to all problems is in development. Development is also the solution to the tension that people talk about. If we provide employment to people, if we ensure there's food on their plates, if we provide them with facilities and give them education, all the tension will end. And this is why, all those who want good for the nation, I request them to compete towards development and for development. This atmosphere should be created in the country and I think such an environment is being created nowadays.So the hot heads who make extreme comments, is there a necessity to control them? So that there is no politics in the name of religionFirstly, I am of the firm belief that the nation should progress on the issue of development. And it is necessary that the country moves forward on the issue of development. I would like to tell the media not to make heroes out of those people who make such comments.But they keep making such commentsDon't make them heroes, they will stopWe don't make them heroes, we make them villains.But why do you make them so big? I see such statements by people on TV, whose faces I haven't even seen and they end up becoming spokesmen on TVSelf styled spokesmenI don't know why such people are encouragedMr Prime Minister, let's talk in 2016 of the 2017 elections. After Delhi, then Bihar, then Assam, West Bengal. After that we will talk about Punjab. Before we finish talking about Punjab, we will talk about Uttar Pradesh. Then there is the Gujarat state election. Don't you think that this country is permanently stuck in an electoral cycle? The focus constantly and I want you to reflect on this issue, the focus is on party politics, polarising issues, not on governance. We are a country, if we say, we are constantly in a political campaign mode. Is this a good thing? Should we break away from it? And what is your view on it?See this is not an issue about Narendra Modi or the Prime Minister. And also it is not an issue about a particular party or a particular Government.But before the last Parliament session, the Speaker had called all the parties for a meal. After the agenda meeting everyone was sitting to eat. I had also reached at the same time. While talking casually over food, almost people from all parties said that the central and state elections must be held together. Everyone said it. After that during the farewell function of the Rajya Sabha MPs, people from different parties were talking with each other. One of the leaders said, Modiji do anything but get us out of this cycle of electionsWas that leader from your party?No, he was not from my party. So I said that discussion should happen. What is wrong in that? Then one day I said that this was being talked about. This issue has also been discussed in a Parliamentary committee. This work has also been started by the Election Commission and I think they have also writen a letter on it. Like in the fight against black money, this issue of elections also gets connected to black money. Electoral reforms are necessary if the country has to be rid of black money. It is one of the areas for electoral reforms. I believe that the Prime Minister cannot take a decision on this and nor should he do that. Neither the government can do this. There should be a broad discussion on this and we should not run away from the debate on this continious cycle of elections. The Indian voter today is very mature. He votes in one fashion in the Lok Sabha elections, he votes in a different manner in the State Assembly elections. We have seen this. In 2014, the General Elections conincided with the Odisha Assembly elections. The same electorate gave one judgement for Odisha and another judgement for Delhi. So this country's voter is very mature and we should trust his maturity. There should be a debate on how costs can be reduced by holding simultaneous elections, how the influence of black money can be curbed, how the five years can be spent in taking the country forward. Today due to the model code of conduct, there is a loss even in those areas where the code is not applicable. When I was in Gujarat, I found that at least 80 to 90 officers were spending two to three months on election duties in other states. This could be happening in every state. So this is an area of concern and some time or the other this question will have to be thought of. I would want the Election Commission to take this debate forward. They should invite all political parties and hold discussions with everybody and whatever comes out of itCan there be a timebound resolution in this?The Election Commission will have to invite all political parties to discuss this. The process will get derailed if one party were to initiate thisAre you willing to take the lead in building that consensus?Despite being the Prime Minister, I still belong to a political party. The better thing would be for the Election Commission to initiate this. Today the Election Commission is a very prestigious institution in our country. Every political party believes in the Election Commission and it will further empower this institution and that will be betterI think it is an interesting idea of simultaneous elections. Though state parties, regional parties may feel that it will effect them badly. That the national parties like the BJP will gainOdisha is the best example. Odisha is the best example. In 2014, the BJP had no advantage in the state but the BJP won on the Lok Sabha seats. This shows the differenceMr Prime Minister how are you keeping your schedule nowadays? I mean you keep a terrifying pace. The number of meetings you hold, people say your officers find it hard to keep upIt is not so, it has been 2 years now and everyone is used to the work. I believe that it is such a big country that one must do as much work as possible. So I keep doing thatBefore I come to my last question Mr Prime Minister, one issue that I want to come to is the farmers' crisis. As you are well aware, there has been a crisis in this country, you referred to it. In that speech to your MPs, about which I asked you earlier as well, on 20th May in the Central Hall of Parliament you said that 'this government is not for myself, this government is for the poor, we must do something for them.' The farmers' crisis Mr Prime Minster is a reality. I am glad that in this interview you have not avoided the reality, you've faced it, you've talked about it. We have linked our entire future to the monsoons. How do we overcome this from becoming an annual crisis in this country?We will have to put stress on water management here. You must have seen that under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayi Yojana, we have put stress on water issues. During these drought days, I met leaders from 11 states separately and sat with them for about 2-3 hours each. The country would have believed that their Prime Minister is working even if I had held a meeting with 11 of them together for around 10 minutes. But I didn't do that. I sat with leaders from different states separately to understand specific problems and what we could do for water in those states. I am happy, whichever party the state government affiliated to, all the governments focused a lot on water issues this summer. We will reap its benefits this monsoon. Using scientific methods for water accumulation and irrigation, collecting water and directing them towards the fields, everyone did that. Micro irrigation is stressed upon. Even for sugarcane farming, farmers are slowly moving towards micro irrigation which earlier happened through flood irrigation. Paddy crops for which large amount of water is used. Today, farmers have started using drip irrigation for it. If we do well in water facilities, then one of the problems is solved. After independence, for the first time, we have brought in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana which can cover maximum number of farmers. The farmer will have to pay only 2%, only 2%, the government will take care of the rest. The farmers will get an assurance. For instance, in Maharashtra, the monsoons are expected in the month of June, the farmers have prepared for everything but haven't started with the sowing process. Now if there are no rains till August, so practically his crops have not been damaged, because he did not sow the seeds. But the Pradhan Mantri fasal Beema Yojana even takes this into consideration and benefits the farmer. Another important aspect, once the crops are harvested, they're cut and kept in the field, assuming it has been a good year for crop growth, with 100% crop production, but it hasn't been loaded on trucks and sent to the market yet. And if it rains, even after 15 days of harvesting, if there is loss, it is covered under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana. Second layer of protection, minimum premium with maximum cover. After independence, for the first time, we have brought in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana. Thirdly, first time we have brought in E-Mandi concept. Farmer in the village, can sell the crops to the best markets in the country through his mobile phone. Farmer would set the price at which the crop would be sold. Earlier, farmers used to take the produce on carts or tractors, used to go to a mandi 20-25kms away, then due to storage issues, even if they had to sell for Rs 10 less than the price, they used to sell it. Now, sitting at home the farmer would know what price to sell the crops at. Next point is about, food processing, value addition. We opened up 100% foreign direct investment in food processing. For example, if a farmer is selling tomatoes and if a company is processing tomato ketchup then my farmers would benefit from it. The companies that make aerated drinks, Coca-Cola, Pepsi etc, I requested them to add 5% natural fruit juice. In regions near Nagpur and Vidarbha where oranges are cultivated, Coca-Cola is going to add 5% of orange juice. If we add 5% natural juice to aerated water, farmers would get their market and their fruits wouldn't go waste. We should have a comprehensive all-out scheme. So much of our land has been damaged. We have brought in Soil Health Card. We have a Soil Health Abhiyan. The farmer will know the feritility of the land through it. Whether a fertilizer needs to be used or not, the farmer will understand. On an average, a farmer with 1 hectare of land will be able to save Rs 15000-20000. So we have brought in scientific methods. You would know that in our country, farmers used to be lathicharged when they would go to buy urea and they had to buy it in black. We got urea 100% neem coated. Earlier, urea used to go to chemical factories, and the government subsidies were stolen in the name of farmers. After neem coating, urea cannot be used for any other purpose except farming. Because of neem coating, there is a qualitative change which helps in healing the damaged land. Due to neem coating a piece of land that used 10 kgs of urea can now manage with 7 kgs of urea. All these initiatives are in the direction of agriculture and the results will be seen soon.Do you think that the farmers' crisis will be resolved, the question I asked, that it won't be an annual affair, the dependence on monsoons will go down?See agriculture is a state subject. The Indian government has taken initiatives, if the state government are enthusiastic to implement this, which I think they will be. As I told you I met leaders from different states and they worked a lot for water issues. If this works, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana has direct involvement of the central government, it will have great benefits.Mr Prime Minister now I have two questions for you.This has become too long.I'll club these two (questions) together. You're also enjoying it and I am glad you're speaking Mr Prime Minister because there is so much ground to cover and I think viewers would like to hear your view, sir. Actually there are three, if you allow me. They're short questions. First is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, how much is politics playing on your mind? In the sense that every Prime Minister, especially someone who is as forthright as you, looks at the next big challenge. Is 2019 anywhere in your mind?Those who have seen me in Gujarat, and those who have seen me in the last two years, those who see me without any bias, they will know that I am an apolitical Prime Minister. Apart from elections, I don't get involved into politics ever. You can call elections a necessity, a restraint or a responsibility, we have to do it. I attend many functions, go to different areas, you wouldn't have heard any political comment from me. If I go to a government function, I talk about government related topics. If I attend a Railways function I talk about railways, if water then water, if water bodies, then water bodies. My focus is on governance. Country has been at greatest loss because governments were run only for elections. Governments must not run only for elections. The government should be a bona fide attempt of meeting the demands and expectations of the common people. Elections should just be a bi-product. It is a democracy. Winning and losing is a part of it. It shouldn't be hyped. You would have seen recently I urged everyone to pay taxes before 30th September. I even said it on Mann Ki Baat yesterday. Will a person, who is only concerned with winning elections, say that post 30th September you'd face problems?This was also a warning in a way.It is a warning. It is definitely a warning. It is a warning. My first warning is to my government officers to not presume citizens as thieves. I have already given this warning. I have handled my officers first. It took me quite some time. You will be shocked to hear that I have given an early retirement to more than 30 people from Income Tax Department on integrity issues. This isn't a small issue. People who weren't transferred since 20 years, I got them transferred. So, one, my focus is on my system. Second, I also tell the country, that for the poor of the nation we would have to give out something for the poor in our country. It is my responsibility to give the people an account of every rupee. I will use it at right places. I won't let it get stolen. But if I need to give houses to the poor, we would need revenue. I don't want to increase taxes, I just want taxes to be paid honestly. There is no need to increase the taxes. The country can run without troubling the citizens. I am working towards it. That is why I have given the citizens a chance to pay the taxes till 30th September, whatever it is Rs 10,000 or Rs. 50,000. If they think they want to come into mainstream, they must and shouldn't be worried. After 30th September, the government will have to take steps. I will not worry about the polls. I will take the necessary steps. I want to work for the poor in my country.Mister Prime Minister, do some crystal ball gazing for the next three years. For the next three years, to use the cricketing analogy, how do you find your run rate so far and will you have to score at a higher run rate in the next three years to achieve your targets?See, no matte at what speed I move forward, I am never satisfied. If today I run at a speed of 100, I keep an aim of running at 200. I think that the world that was behind us, has gone ahead. We need to run a lot to match that level. So we do not need to calculate. We just need to give it all in. And I have given myself in completely. I've been successful is pulling my entire government in. I believe that the country is also committed to move forwardFinal question to you Mr Prime Minister, what motivates you the most? First of all as I said, will you be able to keep this pace? What motivates you the most and also if you can share with our viewers honestly what is your one greatest source of worry?Firstly, I don't live under the burden of worries. Problems and challenges are there, you can't deny that. But you must challenge the challenges and not let the challenges turn into worries. This is my principle. I challenge the challenges. I like to face the problems. I don't run away from them. Whatever loss I have to face for it, I face it. But I can't leave the country helpless. This responsibility must be taken and I will continue to do so. For all good and bad things, it is my responsibility. I do not regret anything. I believe, people of the country have given me the responsibility and I must fulfill it. Thirdly, when I see the poor in our country, it reminds me of the work that I have to do for them. Day before yesterday, I was in Pune, and met a Shrimaan Chandrakant ji. A retired teacher with a pension of Rs 16000, donates Rs 5000 every month for Swachh Abhiyaan. If a 70 year old retired teacher with children and family at home, without worrying about them, worries about the country, then being the Prime Minister, I should work a thousand times more than Chandrakant ji. This is my inspiration. People of this country who work day and night, they are my inspiration. I look at them and I work even harder.Prime Minister Narendra Modi it has been a privilege. I am grateful for this interview.Thank youAnd thank you on behalf of all our viewers that you spoke frankly. The program is Frankly Speaking and I am thankful to you that you were so frank.I just request you to not create controversies out of this but instead use it for the benefit of the country.Please do not think like that. Thank you very muchThanks a lot. Thank you very much.","prime minister's interviewprism of pakistanprime minister narendra modi in an interview with times now has shared his views on a range of issues. here is the complete transcript of thewith arnab goswami.prime minister modi thank you very much for this interview. thank you very muchmy greetings to all the peoplethis is your first one to one interview to a private news channel since you became prime minister. and if i am not mistaken, this is the first ever interview by a sitting prime minister of india to a private television news channel in the country. so i would first like to thank you and am very grateful for the opportunity.the world of the media has grown so big that everybody has to attach themselves with it.i am very grateful and our viewers will be very grateful also mr modi because they want to hear your views on a range of subjects. mr prime minister i would like to start by taking you back to 20th may 2014. the results came on may 16th. four days later, you gave a historic speech in the central hall of parliament and you were speaking to the members of parliament. you had said four days after the results that an era of responsibility has begun. and that you said that in 2019 before the elections, i will come back to this parliament, i will come back to the mps and i will give my report card. forty percent into your tenure, how much have you achieved of your own targets?when i went for the first time as an mp to the central hall, and it was the first time i was seeing the central hall. i had not been there before. so i had then said that becoming the prime minister was not about the designation of the office but it was about the responsibilities and work of being a pm. i had also said that my government would be committed to the poor. i was completely new in the job. delhi was new for me. the delhi environment was new to me. the work of the government of india was also new for me. but despite that, in such a short time, the pace at which the country has moved forward, and it's not on one subject. you can pick up any aspect of the government's functioning, and if you make a comparison with the past governments, then you will realize that no issue has been ignored. there has been an effort to bring in something new in every area. there is an effort to bring in change in every area. one big challenge was that i was not experienced about this place, i had not even been an mp. the office was new, the questions were also new. but when i look at the second biggest challenge, we should remember those days when the country was engulfed in disappointment. the everyday news was about whether there would be any electricity production after seven days, whether coal would be supplied or not. this was the situation then. the entire system was engulfed in disappointment. the big challenge was to inject new trust into the system and create confidence among the citizens. it is very difficult to evaluate this from the outside but i have gone through it. but today i can say with a lot of satisfaction that now there is no trace of any disappointment. the intention to do something is visible. and it's not in words but in actual achievement. i had said that within a given timeframe, we will open bank accounts for the poor. for something that had not been done for 60 years, setting a timeframe for it was in itself a risk. but because of that a trust was created in the system that it was something doable. so that's the process i started for awakening the confidence. and today you can see that in every sector, the changed circumstances can be seen. while evaluating the performance of this government, never forget that you will have to make that evaluation in comparison with the 10 years of the previous government. only then will you know where we were and where we are now. we should not be talking about what we are aiming for. for now you will have to assess the present in comparison with the immediate past and in that you will find a bright futuremr. modi, i want to start now on the issue of foreign policy. in the area of foreign policy, you have taken great personal interest. the amount of personal interest you have shown in foreign policy, probably none of the previous prime ministers showed the same kind of interest. your approach is pro active. what i find interesting about your foreign policy is that you have balanced different powers and different interests. on the one side, your relationship with us, you made sure that india enters the missile control technology regime with them. a week before that you also signed the historic chabahar port agreement with iran. so, you have balanced very diverse forces. my question to you over this is that, is it easy to do that as an indian prime minister? secondly, on the issue of the nsg, you staked a lot of personal interest, personal push, you lobbied actively. how close are we to getting the nsg seat?firstly, about foreign policy, you need to know what has strengthened our foreign policy. for 30 years, in our country, the government was unstable. for 30 years, party with a clear mandate wasn't given the opportunity to form the government. the world measures the government of a nation on the basis of its condition in its own country, on how strong their word is in their own country. i am thankful to the people of this country, that after 30 years, they chose a government with absolute majority and this has had an impact on world politics. countries and world leaders have changed their perspective towards india. this is the biggest benefit. secondly, the world didn't know me. the world wants to know who the head of the state is. if someone would want to know modi through the eyes of the media, then he would be disillusioned on which modi is the real modi. if this happens, the country will be at a loss. modi's personality shouldn't be a hindrance for the world to have faith in india. but for that unless i meet all those leaders and engage them them one to one, unless i speak to them frankly, they wouldn't know about india's head of state, so it was very important for me as i am not from a political family. i never had the opportunity to meet the world leaders earlier.you were an unknown entity in foreign policymore than foreign policy it was foreign relations. yes, i was new to it. so for me, being pro active was mandatory. thirdly, we work as a team. foreign ministry, prime minister's officer, commerce ministry, finance ministry, defense minister, everyone works as a team, not as separate pieces. the impact that is now visible, is not just because of modi, it is because of the team. all teams work in a particular direction. that is why the impact is seen, earlier these teams were splintered. we have seen instances where the party would give a statement, the prime minister would say something else, party leaders would say something else. this disunity has had a negative impact. thirdly, we also need to understand that earlier the world was bi polar. foreign policy would be centered around two super powers. india was a little late in realizing that this bi polar situation was for namesake. now the entire world, in changed circumstances, especially in 21st century, it is more interdependent and inter connected, earlier, the foreign policy was possible between governments, but today it is not possible just between governments. government relations are important but increasing people to people contact is equally important. there's been a shift in paradigm. because i do not have any previous baggage, because i've had a clean slate, i write everything from beginning and that has a benefit. today we are building relations with countries across the world. the amount of respect with which i engage saudi arabia, i engage iran with the same amount of respect. the amount of respect with which i speak to america, i speak to russia with the same amount of respect. so we need to understand this. we also need to understand that we shouldn't consider smaller countries insignificant. i abide by this principle. the small countries of the world are as important as the big nations. we had assumed that the relations with smaller nations would develop under the shadow of the bigger nations. i brought about a change in this. you must have seen that i made a forum for the pacific island nations. we have had two meetings. i went there once and they came here once. these are small countries with a population of about 10 lakh or 20 lakh. but these small island nations are most affected by global warming. when india took up the international solar mission and 122 nations joined it, the island nations benefitted the most out of it. they are 50 in number now. a group of 50 nations, feels secured with this vision of india. if we try to understand this change, then we would realize that in the world, a few days back, i was sitting with the officers of our foreign services, so as we got talking, in a very poetic way i told them that there was a time when we used to sit by the sea and count the waves, but the time has now changed, we are done counting waves, now it's time for us to steer ourselves, ride the waves and decide on our direction, destination and speedthat is apparent. you have a very aggressive foreign policy. but my second question was, you put so much effort for nsg membership. my question was, how close are we to nsg membership and were you disappointed that we did not make it at the very end because of china's opposition?look the first thing is that india has been continuously making these efforts, no matter which government was in office. be it the membership of the un security council or the sco membership or mtcr membership or nsg membership. every government has made an effort. it's not that only this government is trying, it's in continuity. but it's during our tenure that we achieved sco membership, we also got the mtcr membership. i have full faith that now we have begun a coordinated effort for the nsg membership too. the process has begun on a positive note. everything has rules and will work accordingly and move forwardis it the problem of mindset with china? there have been 13 engagements at various levels between the narendra modi government and the chinese government. the latest engagement was when you went to tashkent. you spent some time with the chinese president xi jinping. yet it was seen that in the case of masood azhar, china blocked india's un bid to ban him. now they have stalled india's nsg bid. why is china repeatedly blocking us mr prime minister despite your personal proactive measures and your government's outreach?the first thing is that we have an ongoing dialogue with china and it should continue to happen. in foreign policy it's not necessary to have similar views to have a conversation. even when the views are contradictory, talks are the only way forward and problems should be resolved through dialogue. we don't have one problem with china, we have a whole lot of problems pending with china. slowly and steadily, an effort is on to address these issues through talks and make them less cumbersome. i can say that china has been cooperating with india to search for solutions. on some issues, it's a question of principles for them. on some issues, it's a question of principles for us. on some issues they differ with us and there are issues on which we differ with them. there are some basic differences. but the most important thing is that we can speak to china eye-to-eye and put forth india's interests in the most unambiguous manner. we are a government that takes care of india's interests. we don't compromise on this. three days ago i met the chinese president. i told him clearly about india's interests. they are a different country, we are a different countrydo you think you will be able to change their mindset on the issue of nsg membership?see the foreign policy is not about changing mindsets. foreign policy is about finding the common meeting points. where do our interests converge and how much? we have to sit and talk with every country. it's our ongoing effortthis statement that you just made is also apt in the context of america where you gave a speech in the u.s congress. by the way mr prime minister it was a fantastic speechthank youthere was a lot of humour. you were laughing and cracking jokes while you delivered the speech which was very unique. they also appreciated it. was the speech impromptu?i have a humourous side but these days humour can be a risky thingwhy do you say that?in this era of 24/7 news channels, anybody can lift a small word and make a big issue out of it. but i will tell you the truth, the reason for the absence of humour in public life is this fear. i am myself scared . earlier when i used to make speeches, i would make it so humourous but there would never be any issueshave you become more conscious now?i am not conscious. i am in fear, there is no humour left in public life because of this fear. everyone is scared. i am in fear. my speeches used be humourous. i see it in parliament, that humour is finished there too. it is a matter of concern. i will quote one proverb.yes, go ahead.even if you mention a proverb, they will connect it with something else and begin a conversation. the one who is saying the proverb does not know for what he is speaking.but you should not lose your sense of humour mr prime ministerbut it is true that my trip to the united states of america, my speech in their congress and the respect shown towards india created a lot of hype. had it not been hyped so much, there would not have been so much criticism on the nsg issue. government is being criticized not for any mishandling of the nsg issue but because we were so successful over there (in the usa)did china become conscious of your growing friendship with us?i am talking about what's happening herebut when you delivered that speech in context of america, you used a very interesting phrase. you said 'we have to overcome the hesitations of history'. my hindi is not that good. like hesitations of history. but my question to you is mr prime minister, how close can we get to america because many indians believe that america is still supporting pakistan, giving them military assistance. how close can we get? at what point do we stop before we are seen like an american ally? what is your own world view on that?i would especially like to appeal to my country's media that we should stop looking at everything in india from the. india is an independent country. it is a country of 125 crore people. whenever it approaches any country, it will only be concerned about its own interests. it has been our biggest shortcoming and mistake that we have been tagging ourselves with another country and trying to do things. we are an independent country, we have our own policies and future. we have to think about the future of our 125 crore people. there should be no compromise on our interests. we have relations with america in the context of these fundamental pointshow close can we get to them?there has been warmth in our relationship. you must have seen the editorials in american newspapers after my visit to that country. one point mentioned in those editorials was that the success of obama's foreign policy has been the warm relationship with india. this has been saidwhat you are saying modiji is that we can be close to america but we need not be an ally or seen to be an ally?the first thing is that we no longer live in a bipolar world. the world is interconnected and interdependent. you will have to connect with everybody at the same time. even if there are two opposing countries, they will have to be friends. now the times have changedmr modi, on 8th may 2014, i had the opportunity to interview you, the interview took place in ahmedabad, i think one last phase of elections was left. we were discussing the issue of pakistan. you have had an uncompromising approach towards pakistan. two days back, lashkar e toiba killed 8 crpf jawans in an attack. in the 8th may interview, you put forth a very interesting phrase, you said 'can talks be heard amidst the noise of bombs, guns and pistols?' this is how you had phrased it. do you believe we have been too generous towards pakistan? do you believe we have been too generous towards pakistan?there are two things. one - india has always wanted friendly ties with its neighbours, there can be no debate around it. we want to live in harmony and peace. and i have said it repeatedly, that india has to fight poverty, pakistan too has to fight poverty, why don't we come together to fight poverty? i said this before elections and during election campaigns. also i had invited leaders of saarc nations to my swearing in ceremony and they had attended it as well. so there has been no change in our intent, our thoughts and our current behaviour. number two - those who have to work from the table, will work from the table and those who have to work at the border, will work at border with full strength. each one will fulfill the responsibility entrusted to them. and our jawans are fulfilling their responsibilities. it's true that pressure on terrorists has increased, their schemes are proving unsuccessful. the intent with which they move forward are foiled and they have to face major challenges. it is because of this disappointment that such incidents are taking place and our jawans are risking their lives and protecting the country. we are very proud of our jawanswhen your foreign policy is studied, observers analyze what's happening and what's not happening. if you give me the opportunity, i want to do a bit of analyses. there was a terrific pace of engagement with pakistan between october, november and december. on 30th november, you met nawaz sharif on the sidelines (of un climate summit in paris). both of you were seated on a sofa, talking to each other. a lot of people were speculating the contents of your conversation. this was on the sidelines of climate summit. after that, all of a sudden within seven days there were nsa level talks and ajit doval spoke to nasir janjua in bangkok. and again after that you went to russia via afghanistan, you made an unexpected visit to nawaz sharif in lahore. it was a personal trip but it still had some level of importance. eight days later, pakistani terrorists attacked pathankot. can you tell our viewers whether pakistan was proactively responding in the months of october, november and december? did the pathankot terror attack change the situation? is it true that pakistan was making a lot of movement in those three months?look there are different types of forces operating in pakistan. but the government only engages with a democratically elected system. our effort for that engagement is continuing. but our supreme objective is peace. our supreme objective is to protect india's interests. we keep making effort toward that objective and sometimes our efforts are successful. as far as meetings and talks are concerned, we signalled right from the day i took oath and sent invitations for the oath taking ceremony, that we seek friendly relations but without compromising on our interests. and that is why i have said that my country's soldiers have full freedom to answer back in whatever manner they have to and they will keep doing thatmr prime minister what is the 'lakshman rekha' that you would draw when it comes to pakistan. there is some confusion surrounding this subject. i would like you to give an elaborate reply. in 2014, it was believed that if talks are being held, then they should be held between two countries and not with hurriyat. it should be between the government of india and the government of pakistan. the other 'lakshman rekha' is that you must act on 26/11. there's been no forward movement so far. the third thing is about forward movement on the pathankot attack case. so what is the 'lakshman rekha' now and if pakistan remains within those bounds, so talks can happen at the political level or at any other level?the first thing is that with pakistan, to whom do we talk to decide about the 'lakshman rekha'. will it be with the elected government or with other actors? that is why india will have to be on alert all the time. india will have to be alert every moment. there can never be any laxity in this. but there is an outcome due to my continuous efforts like my visit to lahore and my invitation to the pakistani prime minister to come to india. now i don't have to explain to the world about india's position. the world is unanimously appreciating india's position. and the world is seeing that pakistan is finding it difficult to respond. if we had become an obstacle, then we would have had to explain to the world that we are not that obstacle. now we don't have to explain to the world. the world knows our intentions. like on the issue of terrorism, the world never bought india's theory on terrorism. they would sometime dismiss it by saying that it's your law and order problem. today the world has to accept what india has been saying about terrorism. india's dialogue on terrorism, the losses india has suffered due to terrorism, the losses suffered by humanity, the world is now acknowledging that. so i believe we have to take this process forwardmr prime minister i now want to move to questions on the economy. in the past two years you have started many schemes. if we look at the theme of jan dhan yojna for financial inclusion, pradhan mantri fasal bima yojna for crop insurance, swach bharat, skill india, make in india. if we see the theme running through these schemes, is your social agenda at the core of your personal economic philosophy, social transformation? is the social agenda at the core of your economic philosophy as the prime minister?the first point is our philosophy is to reach the last man in the line. pandit deendayal upadhyay's philosophy forms the core of our political, economic and social ideology. and even mahatma gandhi used to say that what is there for the last man? so my development parameter is very simple. it is about how the poorest of the poor can benefit from development. the poor is the central focus of my economic agenda. the poor should be strengthened in such a way that they get the willingness to defeat poverty. by helping the poor make ends meet while they remain in poverty is also one of the ways. i am not saying right or wrong but it's one of the ways. but today the country's situation is such that we should make the poor strong so that they become partners in defeating poverty. all these schemes are meant to empower the poor and change the quality of life. the pradhan mantri jan dhan yojna is not only about opening bank accounts for the poor. because of this the poor are feeling that they are becoming a part of the country's economic system. the bank that he was seeing from afar, now he is able to enter that bank. this brings about a psychological transformation. looked at in another way, did you ever imagine that 40 thousand crores could be injected into the banking system by contributions from the poor. the poor who never had bank accounts, have deposited 100 rupees, 50 rupees or 200 rupees. it means that poor man saved 100 rupees and the change began in his life. we have taken up construction of toilets. i had gone to chhattisgarh and had the opportunity to get the blessings of one mother. an adivasi mother heard about the scheme for building toilets. she sold her four goats and built a toilet. that 90 old mother uses a walking stick and goes around the cluster of 30 or 40 houses in the tribal village and has been spreading the message to build toilets. this change is becoming the reason for the change in the quality of life. i have begun the cleanliness campaign. it's estimated an individual spends an average of 7000 rupees for treatment of a disease. the main reason for disease is filth. the poor suffer the most from the filth. if a poor man falls sick, he cannot drive his rickshaw for two days and his children go hungry. so how can we help the poor bring about change in their lives? now there is a neo-middle class and a middle class in the country. the young have their aspirations. so another aspect of my policies you must have seen are the start up india, stand up india, seaport activity, port activity, railways expansion, railway station upgradation. these changes directly appeal to the middle class. the middle class has its aspirations. we have to create jobs? how will job creation happen? till i invest in the development of infrastructure, there be no job creation. you must have seen that the maximum electricity generation since independence has occurred this year. the maximum amount of coal mined has been in this year. the maximum length of roads being constructed daily is happening in this year. the fastest loading and unloading of steamers at sea ports is happening now. all these changes are creating opportunities for employment like in start up india, stand up india. for instance in stand up india, i have said that every bank should give an economic opportunity to one woman, one dalit or one tribal person to become entrepreneurs. this will create many job opportunities. so this is the basis of my economic philosophy.mr prime minister if i could interrupt you on this. on the one hand is the people's expectations and on the other is your vision. many programs that you have mentioned, you can't put a calendar date to it but they don't have an immediate impact. they maybe able to show results in 3, 4, 5 maybe beyond 5 years. now there are challenges in that. mr prime minister, you are aware more than anyone else that people want immediate results. now you spoke of job creation. the first thing, as an achievement you have managed to grow the economy at 7.5 per cent when the global economic climate is very bleak. you have spoken about it as well. you have met fiscal deficit targets, fdi inflows have increased but people are saying that job opportunities are not increasing. you have spoken about infrastructure but the current rate of unemployment. mr prime minister, the latest labour bureau figures, is it a source of concern for you as the prime minister?the first thing is that are 800 million people below the age of 35 in our country. we have to accept that the demand for jobs is very high. but where will they get employment? investment will come in. it will be used in the infrastructure sector, manufacturing and services sector. now like the initiative we have taken, we have started the mudra yojna. more than three crore people in the country comprise washermen, barbers, milkman, newspaper vendors, cart vendors. we have given them nearly 1.25 lakh crore rupees without any guarantee. now why have these people taken the money? to expand their work. when he expands his work, if he is currently employing one person, now he has to employ two people. if there were two employed earlier, now there are three. now just think, when 3 crore of these small businesses have got access to finance, they must have expanded their work. now all this is not in the labour department's registration. three crore people have expanded their work. we took another small decision. the big malls in the country run 365 days a year but the smaller shops have to close on holidays. we announced in the budget that even a small shopkeeper can operate his shop till late night and that too on all the seven days of the week. if the malls don't have restrictions then why should the small shopkeepers have restrictions. so now if a shopkeeper operates his shop till late and on all seven days, if he earlier employed one person, now he will have to employ two people. so won't the employment increase?so is your focus on entrepreneurship?our focus is on all aspects. now we are saying that by 2022 we want to ensure that everyone has a house. housing sector has the maximum potential for creating employment. houses will be built in such huge numbers, how many people will get employment? you must have seen that last year we brought in a textile policy. under this textile policy, there will be income tax benefits for those who create employment. the more employment one creates, the more tax benefits they will get. for the first time, employment generation and tax has been linked. these are the things that boost employment and our central focus is creating employment for the ordinary citizenmr prime minister, questions are also being raised on food inflation which has still not decreased. the expectation was that the food inflation would decline. the people had put their hopes on the prime minister that you will bring down prices. this not only has a political impact but also has a social impact. over the past two weeks, there were reports that in some places the price of arhar dal had touched 150 rupees and 200 rupees for other pulses. the price of tomatoes was also rising. is this only seasonal because the food inflation is increasing at 7.5 per cent year on year. global oil prices have fallen. do you think this creates perception issues for your government?you can't view inflation as a perception issue. price rise should be seen as a reality. what is available for a consumer should be seen for what it is. there should never be an attempt to view price rise as a perception issue as a means of escaping the reality of price rise. we will have to accept reality. you see the fast pace at which prices were rising under the previous government, today that speed has decelerated a lot. you can see the statistics, you will find it there. second, the country has gone through two consecutive years of severe drought. drought has a direct impact on the price of vegetables, food and pulses because all these things are produced from the soil. now when there is such a big drought, it's not in anybody's hands. the second option in such a situation is imports. the indian government has imported pulses in huge quantities. third, it is the joint responsibility of the state and central governments. it is not exclusively the state's responsibility. it is not exclusively the centre's responsibility. it is the joint responsibility of both the state and central governments. this should not be an issue of blame game that the state government did not do certain things and that the centre did not do certain things. but it will have to be agreed that it is the joint responsibility of both. that is why the centre has given rights to the states to make stringent laws. how much stocks to keep or not to keep are decisions which the states can take. all these rights have been given to the states. some states have performed well, some states are trying. but the centre and state governments are trying to work together on this. i believe that we have been successful to the extent that the speed with which prices were rising (under upa), what would have happened if the prices were to rise at that speed. we have been successful in stopping that speedy rise of prices. but as far as pulses are concerned, production in india has been very low. many farmers who were earlier sowing pulses have started cultivating sugar. that is also an area of concern. we gave special incentives for pulses. we have tried to set up a different msp for pulses. we have taken steps to procure pulses from farmers with bonus. our focus is on increasing the production of pulses. we are also focusing on building stocks of pulses by importing from abroad. an all out effort is being made and i believe that nobody doubts the sincerity of this governmentmr prime minister what is your view about the controversy around the exit of raghuram rajan as the rbi governor? a lot has been spoken about this. there was commentary that it may effect india's image, perception as a global economy. what's your own view of the controversy around the exit of raghuram rajan?when my government was formed in may 2014, you take newspapers from may, june, july 2014 and check television debates during that period. the topic of the television debates would be - will the new govt let raghuram rajan continue? or will the new government oust raghuram rajan? and there was more or less consensus that he was appointed by the previous govt and so modi won't let him complete his tenure and will remove him. you have seen, that he worked his entire tenure. for the time he was appointed by the previous government, he completing his entire term. so all the misconceptions have been dispelled. secondly, according to my 2 year experience in govt, those who are creating controversies, are being unjust to raghuram rajanwhy so?i will tell you. those who say...i believe raghuram rajan's patriotism is no less than any of ours. it will be doing injustice to him if one says that he will serve the country only if he is at a particular post. as much as i know raghuram rajan, whatever post he holds, wherever he is, he is someone who will continue to serve the country. he is someone who loves his country. therefore, it's not like the nation won't get raghuram rajan's services, raghuram rajan is not that kind of a person. he is a person who loves the country. those who speak such language are doing great injustice to him. my experience with him has been good.i appreciate the work he has done. and my good wishes will always be with himprime minister modi, there's a question related to this. during your speech at the executive you used seven words begining with letter 's'-- 'sevabhaav' (service), 'santulan' (balance), 'sanyam' (restraint), 'samvaad' (dialogue), 'samanvay' (coordination), 'sakaratmak' (positivity) and 'samvedna' (sensitivity). i will ask the question in context with raghuram rajan because you used these words in the speech at national executive meet speech on june 14 in allahabad. you said, 'our party leaders and party workers should use these qualities in their daily dealings and behaviour.' prime minister, in raghuram rajan's context, your rajya sabha mp has made many comments. later he made critical remarks against senior bureaucrats. my question is, do you think it is right? when we talk about 'sanyam' (restraint) and 'santulan' (balance), is it correct?whether it is someone from my party or not, i believe that such things are inappropriate. the nation won't benefit from such publicity stunts. one should be more responsible while conducting themselves. anyone who believes he is bigger than the system is wrong.that's a very clear message.i have a very clear message. i have no two minds about it.and mr prime minister, if i may say so, between may 8 and now, you are speaking as straight as you did before you took over as prime minister. i think that answer takes me to the next subject. mr prime minister, the issue is that of black money. in a very interersting way you said, prices should not be looked at from the point of percepetion, equally, mr prime minister it can be said said that an issue like black money should not be looked at in terms of perception, but it is perception forming. there are political debates on this. experts say that the black money economy has shrunk, 10-15% economy has shrunk through land dealings and other things. you have passed the black money bill, you have made taxation more transparent, you have started information sharing with other countries, you have taken steps, but prime minister modi, people still expect that a rs 25 lakh crores will be brought back and put into their bank accounts. how will you address that expectation? the hope that people have taking black money, how will you address it?how did the black money issue arise and how did it become such a serious issue? we have to look at the background. it is an established fact in the minds of the common man those who steal money park their money overseas. it's a common perception. even if i look at it from the common man's perspective, i also wonder where does this money go? this issue was always stalled in the parliament. when the matter reached the supreme court, the supreme court ordered special investigation team to look into it, even then the previous government stalled it for three years, from 2011-2014. it's after this that political parties, the media and the common man started believing that there's something wrong. then the issue of black money became an agenda. even today i can say...that yes, when there is money stashed in foreign accounts, there are some norms of engagement with foreign countries on the issue. but between 2011-2014, these people were given the opportunity to launder money here and thereand you also said on 17 february 2015 on this issue, that the then law minister is only offering lip servicethe result was that people got several chances to launder money. secondly, after our government was formed, the first decision taken by our cabinet was to form a special investigation team to bring back black money which was pending despite supreme court's 2011 order. this shows our sincerity. from then on, you can't imagine how stringent the laws have been made to bring back black money and whoever comes in its fold will know how strict the law is. thirdly, i attended the g20 summit. never was black money issue discussed in the g20 forum. it was my first g20 summit, for the first time i met the world leaders. and for the first time in the g20 summit, one paragraph was on unaccounted money, on black money and 20 countries said that the world should cooperateblack. the dirty money, black money was also linked to terrorism, an environment of global census was created. we have been signing agreements one after the other with different countries that there will be real time, automatic exchange of information with india. i recently visited switzerland and there was minimal discussion on the issue. but after i returned, a big delegation from switzerland visited india, and they held meeting with the indian government and we discussed...for several years, we believed that switzerland is the place where black money is stashed, that country is holding discussions to come to a consensus on automatic information exchange and if we reach consensus it will be a great achievement. thirdly you must've seen that mauritius route came up in almost everything. it was said that money goes out of india and returns through the mauritius route. this was discussed. everyone thought that nothing can be done about the mauritius route.but our government held a dialogue with the mauritius government, made changes to the old treaty. and we successfully made a new treaty to block the money which comes through the mauritius route and very soon it will be phased out and completed. all these decisions are taken to fight the black money menace. this is not a one sided fight. secondly, the govt is working in a direction to make sure that black money isn't generated in india and black money doesn't go out of india, you can see the results of all this.when the opposition raises the rs 15 lakh issue.that is something the opposition raises during elections. let them have some issue to talk aboutmr prime minister, there has been no major financial corruption or scam in your tenure in the last two years. perception is again, what people say is because you keep a very tight control on the reins of government but the question is there are people, who are wilful defaulters, the economic offenders who take a lot of money from the country or commit economic offences in the country, go overseas and use rules and use lawyers, and they don't come back to india. and people are asking now, is the narendra modi govt determined to take these cases of wilful defaulters and economic offenders to their logical conclusion.firstly, this question is not in the minds of people. the people of india have confidence that if there's someone who can do this, it is narendra modi and he will do it. citizens of the country have full faith.does it worry you, that people have misued the law?i take this as an opportunity and i will show them what the law is.mr. modi, there have been several corruption cases about the previous government, which have now come out. there is agustawestland, many defense scams and defense transactions are now being analyzed seriously. the cases which were quoted in the cag reports but were ignored are now coming in the forefront. this question is important because this isn't just about financial corruption but these questions have direct implications on the national security of the country. do you think, when they say that this is a political witch hunt by narendra modi sarkar, do you think all of these cases would have been possible without political patronage?there are many things which are not visible. one can't imagine the difficulty i am experiencing in taking out things from dirt. one who is working there knows the amount of dirt that exists and how certain things have been caught in a web. there are certain powers behind it. the case about agusta helicopters. i can't deny it and i believe that we have the right to doubt that people behind this are very experienced. they have perfectly practiced the art of doing wrong deeds. they are very experienced and knowledgeable. and one can also smell the fact that such a thing wouldn't have been done without a shield. now, agencies are probing. let's see how far the probe goes. but the investigation shouldn't go ahead while people are being targeted, neither does my government target anyone. the sin has been committed, but how much is done, how was it done, who did it, probe agencies will find out in a professional way. whatever comes out, will be put outprime minister, talking about your speech in the us congress, and the humour that you displayed. i felt some of it was impromptu. but the americans were able to relate to what you said, i don't remember the exact words, you said, i am informed that the working of the us congress is harmonious. and then there was a pause and people were laughing. then you said, 'i am told' - you emphasized and said 'i am told that you are well known for your bipartisanship.' then the applause was more. and then you said, 'you are not alone. time and again i have witnessed a similar spirit in the indian parliament.' you spoke about a serious topic in a interesting manner. you referred to the upper house. there was a lot of response on that too. your humour was really appreciated and i think it was a wonderful moment when you were speaking. but, mr. prime minister, when you look back at the parliament, this question comes to many people's minds, has prime minister narendra modi being held back from achieving his own objectives because of the non-stop parliamentary logjam. how much has this affected his moving towards his own targets? if you critically analyze this situation, do you feel your government could have been more consultative or do you feel the blame is entirely with the opposition?i look at it differently. i believe there have been a lot of problems. whether the fault is ours or their's, i 'll leave it to the people. people will decide. but because of discussions in parliament - we may not come to a decision, the decision could be opposing our view, nothing wrong in that. but at least there should be a discussion. the sad part is, if somebody is running away from debate or don't let discussions happen, then it is a cause of worry in a democracy. whether the government's work is accomplished or not, i don't see it as a cause of worry. if not today, it will happen tomorrow. there are certain things which will happen at an administrative level. the big thing is, parliament is for discussion. parliament is to show dissent. parliament is to give an argument for one's opposition, to present an argument when they support.to uphold this basic spirit of parliament, is the responsibility of every person who values democracy. it is the responsibility of those present in the parliament and those outside. it is the responsibility of those in power and those not in power. this is a matter of spirit and it should be followed. as far as the government is concerned, on every issue and at every forum, we have tried to hold discussions. i myself have met the opposition leaders and spoken to them. key members of the government are also in touch. and you must have seen that many issues have been resolved. in the last session, we have passed 12 bills in rajya sabha, we passed 10 bills in the lok sabha. so the pace has picked up. when people say 'opposition', it is unfair to the opposition. there are some parties in the parliament which are not with the bjp or nda, but are with the government on key decisions. so, to defame the opposition by saying that all opposition parties are against us -- when some people do this, it is wrong. there is one party which has problems. and the whole world knows that party. secondly, to say that 'when you were is opposition, you did it this way' there is a difference between every opposition party. 'we have run the government for 60 years and now we are in the opposition, so we know the nitty-gritties of the government, we know the responsibilities. we can't behave in the way, a new opposition party behaves.' a party which hasn't been in power or hasn't seen anything, could behave in this way. for example, we are in power now, and consider in 2040 we become the opposition party. so, in 2040 we can't have the same conduct as the one we had in 2009 or 2010.congress is a very experienced and old partythat's why i say that, those who have been in power for so many years, shouldn't be doing this. if there is a new party in the opposition, they have a small demand for their state or if an mp has a demand for his/her constituency and does something like this, then we can understand. ones who have been in power for very long, shouldn't be doing such thingsprime minister modi, do you think the gst bill which has been stuck for over one and half years, it is a path-breaking economic reform. it unifies the country. recently you met ms jayalalithaa after she was sworn in as the chief minister, mamata banerjee has extended her support for gst and congress allies at the state level are supporting the gst bill. do you feel optimistic that gst bill will be passed in the next session of the parliament?first we need to understand, that we look at gst only within the purview of an economic reform because of which the right information doesn't come out. not having gst straight away means loss for the poor of uttar pradesh. absence of gst straight away means loss for the poor people of bihar. not passing the gst would mean loss for the poor people of poor states like bengal, orissa and assam. people who sit in the rajya sabha must understand this. gst is beneficial for the poor people of the states represented by them, because those states will economically benefit the most from gst. the money will be used for the welfare of the poor people of those states. this is why be it mamata banerjee, be it nitish kumar, be it akhilesh yadav or naveen patnaik, all these states want the gst bill to be passed at the earliest. there is just one group which has made it the issue of prestige. now the kind of arithmetic which is working out, i hope that this decision is passed in favour of the poor. you will be surprised to what extent has the opposition reached to the level of distortion. in the previous session we introduced an act. indian government has rs 40,000 crore rupees from the campa fund. rs 40,000 crore. we wanted to give that money to the states. states have to use that money for forestry, for greenery, for planting trees and plants. the bill is meant for that. had this rs 40,000 crore reached the states before the monsoons, it would have been used for the forests. a lot of people would have got employment, people who plant trees would have been employed. there would be plantation and due to the rains the plants would start growing within a year. but just because of obstructionism, states have been deprived of the benefit of rs 40,000 crore. the money was meant for the forests and for the tribals. they blocked it. there was no argument on itthe reason...you had triedmade all efforts.you had invited former prime minister manmohan singh and sonia gandhi here at the race course roadwe held talks at every levelstill? the word you used 'ego issue', why has it become an ego issue? and people would want to know why is the prime minister unable to end this?the prime minister cannot answer this question. those creating obstructions can only answer this question. but despite this, i will keep trying. i am ready to convince them in which ever way possible. if i have to convoke someone over a cup of tea at their house, i am even ready for that. i have no problem. my only aim is the welfare of the poor of my country and the poor of states like uttar pradesh.you spoke of uttar pradesh. mr prime minister, elections will be held in uttar pradesh in 6,7,8 months. the focus of entire nation will be on it. you are the mp from varanasi. but some comments are made by bjp, some say sangh parivar, some independent groups, communal colour is added to it and not just from one party but from other parties as well. mr prime minister are you going to be able to keep development as the sole agenda? the main issue in the uttar pradesh polls should be that of development, it shouldn't get capsized, the focus shouldn't be elsewhere. are you confident that communal agenda will not overpower development?it's my conviction, it's my commitment. you must have seen during the 2014 elections that i fought elections on the issue of development. the new generation of the country only believes in development. i believe that solution to all problems is in development. development is also the solution to the tension that people talk about. if we provide employment to people, if we ensure there's food on their plates, if we provide them with facilities and give them education, all the tension will end. and this is why, all those who want good for the nation, i request them to compete towards development and for development. this atmosphere should be created in the country and i think such an environment is being created nowadays.so the hot heads who make extreme comments, is there a necessity to control them? so that there is no politics in the name of religionfirstly, i am of the firm belief that the nation should progress on the issue of development. and it is necessary that the country moves forward on the issue of development. i would like to tell the media not to make heroes out of those people who make such comments.but they keep making such commentsdon't make them heroes, they will stopwe don't make them heroes, we make them villains.but why do you make them so big? i see such statements by people on tv, whose faces i haven't even seen and they end up becoming spokesmen on tvself styled spokesmeni don't know why such people are encouragedmr prime minister, let's talk in 2016 of the 2017 elections. after delhi, then bihar, then assam, west bengal. after that we will talk about punjab. before we finish talking about punjab, we will talk about uttar pradesh. then there is the gujarat state election. don't you think that this country is permanently stuck in an electoral cycle? the focus constantly and i want you to reflect on this issue, the focus is on party politics, polarising issues, not on governance. we are a country, if we say, we are constantly in a political campaign mode. is this a good thing? should we break away from it? and what is your view on it?see this is not an issue about narendra modi or the prime minister. and also it is not an issue about a particular party or a particular government.but before the last parliament session, the speaker had called all the parties for a meal. after the agenda meeting everyone was sitting to eat. i had also reached at the same time. while talking casually over food, almost people from all parties said that the central and state elections must be held together. everyone said it. after that during the farewell function of the rajya sabha mps, people from different parties were talking with each other. one of the leaders said, modiji do anything but get us out of this cycle of electionswas that leader from your party?no, he was not from my party. so i said that discussion should happen. what is wrong in that? then one day i said that this was being talked about. this issue has also been discussed in a parliamentary committee. this work has also been started by the election commission and i think they have also writen a letter on it. like in the fight against black money, this issue of elections also gets connected to black money. electoral reforms are necessary if the country has to be rid of black money. it is one of the areas for electoral reforms. i believe that the prime minister cannot take a decision on this and nor should he do that. neither the government can do this. there should be a broad discussion on this and we should not run away from the debate on this continious cycle of elections. the indian voter today is very mature. he votes in one fashion in the lok sabha elections, he votes in a different manner in the state assembly elections. we have seen this. in 2014, the general elections conincided with the odisha assembly elections. the same electorate gave one judgement for odisha and another judgement for delhi. so this country's voter is very mature and we should trust his maturity. there should be a debate on how costs can be reduced by holding simultaneous elections, how the influence of black money can be curbed, how the five years can be spent in taking the country forward. today due to the model code of conduct, there is a loss even in those areas where the code is not applicable. when i was in gujarat, i found that at least 80 to 90 officers were spending two to three months on election duties in other states. this could be happening in every state. so this is an area of concern and some time or the other this question will have to be thought of. i would want the election commission to take this debate forward. they should invite all political parties and hold discussions with everybody and whatever comes out of itcan there be a timebound resolution in this?the election commission will have to invite all political parties to discuss this. the process will get derailed if one party were to initiate thisare you willing to take the lead in building that consensus?despite being the prime minister, i still belong to a political party. the better thing would be for the election commission to initiate this. today the election commission is a very prestigious institution in our country. every political party believes in the election commission and it will further empower this institution and that will be betteri think it is an interesting idea of simultaneous elections. though state parties, regional parties may feel that it will effect them badly. that the national parties like the bjp will gainodisha is the best example. odisha is the best example. in 2014, the bjp had no advantage in the state but the bjp won on the lok sabha seats. this shows the differencemr prime minister how are you keeping your schedule nowadays? i mean you keep a terrifying pace. the number of meetings you hold, people say your officers find it hard to keep upit is not so, it has been 2 years now and everyone is used to the work. i believe that it is such a big country that one must do as much work as possible. so i keep doing thatbefore i come to my last question mr prime minister, one issue that i want to come to is the farmers' crisis. as you are well aware, there has been a crisis in this country, you referred to it. in that speech to your mps, about which i asked you earlier as well, on 20th may in the central hall of parliament you said that 'this government is not for myself, this government is for the poor, we must do something for them.' the farmers' crisis mr prime minster is a reality. i am glad that in this interview you have not avoided the reality, you've faced it, you've talked about it. we have linked our entire future to the monsoons. how do we overcome this from becoming an annual crisis in this country?we will have to put stress on water management here. you must have seen that under the pradhan mantri krishi sinchayi yojana, we have put stress on water issues. during these drought days, i met leaders from 11 states separately and sat with them for about 2-3 hours each. the country would have believed that their prime minister is working even if i had held a meeting with 11 of them together for around 10 minutes. but i didn't do that. i sat with leaders from different states separately to understand specific problems and what we could do for water in those states. i am happy, whichever party the state government affiliated to, all the governments focused a lot on water issues this summer. we will reap its benefits this monsoon. using scientific methods for water accumulation and irrigation, collecting water and directing them towards the fields, everyone did that. micro irrigation is stressed upon. even for sugarcane farming, farmers are slowly moving towards micro irrigation which earlier happened through flood irrigation. paddy crops for which large amount of water is used. today, farmers have started using drip irrigation for it. if we do well in water facilities, then one of the problems is solved. after independence, for the first time, we have brought in pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana which can cover maximum number of farmers. the farmer will have to pay only 2%, only 2%, the government will take care of the rest. the farmers will get an assurance. for instance, in maharashtra, the monsoons are expected in the month of june, the farmers have prepared for everything but haven't started with the sowing process. now if there are no rains till august, so practically his crops have not been damaged, because he did not sow the seeds. but the pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana even takes this into consideration and benefits the farmer. another important aspect, once the crops are harvested, they're cut and kept in the field, assuming it has been a good year for crop growth, with 100% crop production, but it hasn't been loaded on trucks and sent to the market yet. and if it rains, even after 15 days of harvesting, if there is loss, it is covered under pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana. second layer of protection, minimum premium with maximum cover. after independence, for the first time, we have brought in pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana. thirdly, first time we have brought in e-mandi concept. farmer in the village, can sell the crops to the best markets in the country through his mobile phone. farmer would set the price at which the crop would be sold. earlier, farmers used to take the produce on carts or tractors, used to go to a mandi 20-25kms away, then due to storage issues, even if they had to sell for rs 10 less than the price, they used to sell it. now, sitting at home the farmer would know what price to sell the crops at. next point is about, food processing, value addition. we opened up 100% foreign direct investment in food processing. for example, if a farmer is selling tomatoes and if a company is processing tomato ketchup then my farmers would benefit from it. the companies that make aerated drinks, coca-cola, pepsi etc, i requested them to add 5% natural fruit juice. in regions near nagpur and vidarbha where oranges are cultivated, coca-cola is going to add 5% of orange juice. if we add 5% natural juice to aerated water, farmers would get their market and their fruits wouldn't go waste. we should have a comprehensive all-out scheme. so much of our land has been damaged. we have brought in soil health card. we have a soil health abhiyan. the farmer will know the feritility of the land through it. whether a fertilizer needs to be used or not, the farmer will understand. on an average, a farmer with 1 hectare of land will be able to save rs 15000-20000. so we have brought in scientific methods. you would know that in our country, farmers used to be lathicharged when they would go to buy urea and they had to buy it in black. we got urea 100% neem coated. earlier, urea used to go to chemical factories, and the government subsidies were stolen in the name of farmers. after neem coating, urea cannot be used for any other purpose except farming. because of neem coating, there is a qualitative change which helps in healing the damaged land. due to neem coating a piece of land that used 10 kgs of urea can now manage with 7 kgs of urea. all these initiatives are in the direction of agriculture and the results will be seen soon.do you think that the farmers' crisis will be resolved, the question i asked, that it won't be an annual affair, the dependence on monsoons will go down?see agriculture is a state subject. the indian government has taken initiatives, if the state government are enthusiastic to implement this, which i think they will be. as i told you i met leaders from different states and they worked a lot for water issues. if this works, pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana has direct involvement of the central government, it will have great benefits.mr prime minister now i have two questions for you.this has become too long.i'll club these two (questions) together. you're also enjoying it and i am glad you're speaking mr prime minister because there is so much ground to cover and i think viewers would like to hear your view, sir. actually there are three, if you allow me. they're short questions. first is that prime minister narendra modi, how much is politics playing on your mind? in the sense that every prime minister, especially someone who is as forthright as you, looks at the next big challenge. is 2019 anywhere in your mind?those who have seen me in gujarat, and those who have seen me in the last two years, those who see me without any bias, they will know that i am an apolitical prime minister. apart from elections, i don't get involved into politics ever. you can call elections a necessity, a restraint or a responsibility, we have to do it. i attend many functions, go to different areas, you wouldn't have heard any political comment from me. if i go to a government function, i talk about government related topics. if i attend a railways function i talk about railways, if water then water, if water bodies, then water bodies. my focus is on governance. country has been at greatest loss because governments were run only for elections. governments must not run only for elections. the government should be a bona fide attempt of meeting the demands and expectations of the common people. elections should just be a bi-product. it is a democracy. winning and losing is a part of it. it shouldn't be hyped. you would have seen recently i urged everyone to pay taxes before 30th september. i even said it on mann ki baat yesterday. will a person, who is only concerned with winning elections, say that post 30th september you'd face problems?this was also a warning in a way.it is a warning. it is definitely a warning. it is a warning. my first warning is to my government officers to not presume citizens as thieves. i have already given this warning. i have handled my officers first. it took me quite some time. you will be shocked to hear that i have given an early retirement to more than 30 people from income tax department on integrity issues. this isn't a small issue. people who weren't transferred since 20 years, i got them transferred. so, one, my focus is on my system. second, i also tell the country, that for the poor of the nation we would have to give out something for the poor in our country. it is my responsibility to give the people an account of every rupee. i will use it at right places. i won't let it get stolen. but if i need to give houses to the poor, we would need revenue. i don't want to increase taxes, i just want taxes to be paid honestly. there is no need to increase the taxes. the country can run without troubling the citizens. i am working towards it. that is why i have given the citizens a chance to pay the taxes till 30th september, whatever it is rs 10,000 or rs. 50,000. if they think they want to come into mainstream, they must and shouldn't be worried. after 30th september, the government will have to take steps. i will not worry about the polls. i will take the necessary steps. i want to work for the poor in my country.mister prime minister, do some crystal ball gazing for the next three years. for the next three years, to use the cricketing analogy, how do you find your run rate so far and will you have to score at a higher run rate in the next three years to achieve your targets?see, no matte at what speed i move forward, i am never satisfied. if today i run at a speed of 100, i keep an aim of running at 200. i think that the world that was behind us, has gone ahead. we need to run a lot to match that level. so we do not need to calculate. we just need to give it all in. and i have given myself in completely. i've been successful is pulling my entire government in. i believe that the country is also committed to move forwardfinal question to you mr prime minister, what motivates you the most? first of all as i said, will you be able to keep this pace? what motivates you the most and also if you can share with our viewers honestly what is your one greatest source of worry?firstly, i don't live under the burden of worries. problems and challenges are there, you can't deny that. but you must challenge the challenges and not let the challenges turn into worries. this is my principle. i challenge the challenges. i like to face the problems. i don't run away from them. whatever loss i have to face for it, i face it. but i can't leave the country helpless. this responsibility must be taken and i will continue to do so. for all good and bad things, it is my responsibility. i do not regret anything. i believe, people of the country have given me the responsibility and i must fulfill it. thirdly, when i see the poor in our country, it reminds me of the work that i have to do for them. day before yesterday, i was in pune, and met a shrimaan chandrakant ji. a retired teacher with a pension of rs 16000, donates rs 5000 every month for swachh abhiyaan. if a 70 year old retired teacher with children and family at home, without worrying about them, worries about the country, then being the prime minister, i should work a thousand times more than chandrakant ji. this is my inspiration. people of this country who work day and night, they are my inspiration. i look at them and i work even harder.prime minister narendra modi it has been a privilege. i am grateful for this interview.thank youand thank you on behalf of all our viewers that you spoke frankly. the program is

This has had a cascading effect on retail prices which, in case of patotatoes and onions, have shot up by anwhere between 50% and 100%.""I bought potatoes for under Rs 30 a kg on Friday. Today, the prices have gone up to Rs 50. Tomatoes and onions too have increased from Rs 10 to Rs 20. In Delhi, however, the vegetable prices continue to be stable,"" said Kavya Kohli, a resident of Sector 46.Increase in the prices of tomatoes and onions particularly has affected households.""We can opt for brinjal instead of cauliflower or beans instead of peas in case of price rise but we cannot replace essentials like tomatoes and onions.

Vegetables in Gurgaon come from different parts of Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and even Bangalore. Wholesalers, who used to get 80 to 85 tonnes of vegetables everyday, have reduced the quantities to 20 to 22 tonnes for lack of space to store the produce. This has led to decrease in supply leading to increase in the prices.""""We have met all the senior officials and even the agricultural minister and chief minister to discuss the issue at hand. The agricultural minister has called us on October 13. We are only demanding a temporary place from where the wholesale market for time being. The income of over 10,000 families is at stake. Moreover, the common man is bearing the brunt of the government action,"" Thakran added.Agricultural experts feel the absence of the wholesale vegetable market may further increase the vegetable prices, leading to black marketing.""Retailers have already increased the veggie prices owing to decrease in supply. the government's decision to demolish the mandi could be affect the common man adversely,"" said Tarun Kumar Dhull, a city-based agricultural expert.Spread in an area of 2.5 acres, the Khandsa Market was set up in Gurgaon in 1984.

58fefa957be9e0420db2a9df,The ambush on the tongue,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160619/jsp/opinion/story_91990.jsp,2016-06-19,,Telegraph,"Reading about the huge variety of international food now hitting Calcutta makes me imagine the city as a planet which, having placidly circled around its star for billions of years, is suddenly being peppered by rain-waves of asteroids. It's not true, of course: if there was one place in the subcontinent that was a smorgasbord, or rather a khichuri, or perhaps actually a bhelpuri of cosmopolitan foodings, it was this colonial town, soon after its establishment. Besides the massive variety of local food, in its early years the city hosted cuisines from Portugal, France, Britain, Burma, south-east Asia and China, while African, Middle Eastern and Afghan food would also not have been unknown here. Looking back over the last half-century one realizes that the city was in fact provincialized only after the departure of its international citizens. From the mid-1960s to the late 1990s, at the higher price range there was not much available besides the standard, ho-hum five-star fare. Likewise, while the streets retained their great local culinary chutzpah, nothing during those years was particularly exciting or ground-breaking at the lower end of the dining scale either. The city had its cuisine pillars of course, what one could call the Calcutta-Wajid Ali-Lucknow cookery, the most authentic Chinese food in India, and a small cluster of restaurants working the vein of raj Anglo-European cooking. Ringed around Burrabazar and Bhowanipur were also the street foods of north India, Marwar and Gujarat-Bombay, not to mention the South Indian joints near the enclave of Lake Market. Growing up as a doubly local-yokeled kid - south Cal and non-Bong vegetarian - life had in wait a lot of taste surprises for someone like me. I still remember the taste of the first non-Amul cheese, in a sandwich at a French-American couple's house on Pretoria street, some hard cheese, probably Emmental because it had holes, like in the foreign comics, with - I now realize - a thin scrape of Dijon mustard; the first taste of proper French red wine in Delhi as a teenager; the shock of a proper pizza while visiting America; the first taste of Guinness with the tangle of extreme bitter and subtle sweet that could compete with any karela sabzi. Across life, one got to learn that, just as it's possible for many people to be at home anywhere, everybody but almost everybody is a provincial, a local-yokel, during their first years, no matter whether those years are spent in a floating market on the Mekong or a chateau in Mdoc. In this regard, a sudden memory pops up. My mother was a fine cook of Gujarati food and many non-Gujju friends became devotees of the various, classic snack items she'd make. In the mid-1990s, one such friend was working in Dhaka when I travelled to meet her. The loud and repeated request was for me to bring a stack of my mother's much sought after theplas (spiced paratha-type flatbread). I duly took along a box packed with theplas and, since it was Ramazan, a few of these were placed alongside the several other items where the iftar feast was laid out. The thepla fan burst into effusive excitement when she saw the discs loaded with methi leaves and all sorts of spices, and immediately grabbed one. Our host, a sophisticated, upper-class Bangladeshi woman, much travelled and widely exposed to the different foods of the world, also picked up one. As I watched, she took a bite and her head snapped back in shock and revulsion. She quickly put down the offending thing and put distance between herself and the ecstatically mumbling thepla fan. At first I was deeply offended - it was as if my Bangladeshi friend had insulted my mom. But then I thought back at all the electrified rejections and ejections I had made of alien tasting food across my life, not least all sorts of supposedly great Bengali fish, and I calmed down. Like me, my mother, too, couldn't stand any smell of fish, uncooked or cooked. But she would have had equal if not greater revulsion for some of the things I've grown to love, from mutton curry and roast pork to finely sliced carpaccio of raw beef and bresaola. Thinking back, what offended me about my Bangladeshi friend's reaction was that, in my mind, she was after all a desi and not some bland-palate foreigner, and one who wasn't inexperienced in eating spicy subcontinental vegetable preparations, nor desi breads including, I imagine, rotis, luchis and dhakai parathas. Again, another neutralizing memory collides with this one, of when I first went to non-Bombay, proper Maharashtra in my mid-twenties. It was in Pune, one morning, that I asked for a cup of tea at a roadside stall. By now I'd had 'Indian-style tea' in many parts of northern and eastern India; I knew the taste of the thin Bengali chaa in the maatir bhaand, I'd bitten into thick, milky chaay at many Sikh dhabas, I knew well the differently highly sweet and masala loaded chaah in Ahmedabad; I just wasn't prepared for the particular masala they use in Maharashtra (or, at least in Pune) in their roadside tsahaa. Like my future Bangladeshi friend, I almost threw up at the first sip of that stuff and had to really control myself so as not to offend all the slurping Ghaatis around me. It's akin to what a friend, an aficionado of Hindustani classical, said, as he confessed that he couldn't stand Carnatic music, ""Of course you can recognize some of the the same raags as in Hindustani music, the notes are all in the right order, but the spicing is just wrong! I can't bear that!"" I suppose it's about what one is used to, also about what one is expecting to land on one's ear or tongue, and about being unevenly open- and close-minded about different things. For instance, in my rejection of all things piscatory, I remember throwing a fit when I discovered a friend had used (precious) fish sauce in a Thai meal she had lovingly made for my birthday. That was about 20 years ago; now I stock the (readily available) fish sauce in my own cupboard for any visiting culinary artist who wants to use it to cook in my kitchen. Similarly, I've seen other people change their food prejudices, some gradually beginning to like stinky cheese, or the taste of hiing or karela, some having a sudden epiphany about gin, or about the beautiful power of the bhut jolokia chilli. Equally, as time passes, one has witnessed people's tastes (and sometimes world views) shrink, chilli-champions of yore being unable to take even the slightest mirchi-heat, hard-core drinkards of wine rejecting allergy-causing red wine for 'safe' whisky, tomato-phobists actually beginning to use the emperor of fruit-vegetables in their cooking and so on. I think it's great that Calcutta is receiving all these different cuisines, albeit at the moneyed end. I think the ionic exchange between Calcutta the local yokel and world food, and simultaneously between Calcutta the sophisticated food town and the ignorant world, should increase exponentially. In terms of Calcutta as a food-discerning city, I find myself hoping our tastes continue to expand, and not just in some snobbish, money-driven way. It would be great if we were to have different innovative food vans a la so many cities, not just in Europe and America, but all over the globe. It would be extremely desirable (and I know this is a whole different Pandora's box, but it's not unconnected) if we were to avoid the knee-jerk reactions of Bihar (and, previously, Kerala) in following Gujarat into declaring foolish prohibition and decided to really work on changing our drink culture. It would be wonderful to take a leaf out of Bangkok's book and make sure our numerous street food stalls were strictly hygienic and spankingly clean. All of this would (forgive the pun) feed into making Calcutta a different kind of 'food capital' or 'food hub' from what it once used to be. As someone, I forget who exactly, once said, if you change a society's food habits you transform that society itself. This change, if it can be effected, would be a good ambush to face.","reading about the huge variety of international food now hitting calcutta makes me imagine the city as a planet which, having placidly circled around its star for billions of years, is suddenly being peppered by rain-waves of asteroids. it's not true, of course: if there was one place in the subcontinent that was a smorgasbord, or rather a khichuri, or perhaps actually a bhelpuri of cosmopolitan foodings, it was this colonial town, soon after its establishment. besides the massive variety of local food, in its early years the city hosted cuisines from portugal, france, britain, burma, south-east asia and china, while african, middle eastern and afghan food would also not have been unknown here. looking back over the last half-century one realizes that the city was in fact provincialized only after the departure of its international citizens. from the mid-1960s to the late 1990s, at the higher price range there was not much available besides the standard, ho-hum five-star fare. likewise, while the streets retained their great local culinary chutzpah, nothing during those years was particularly exciting or ground-breaking at the lower end of the dining scale either. the city had its cuisine pillars of course, what one could call the calcutta-wajid ali-lucknow cookery, the most authentic chinese food in india, and a small cluster of restaurants working the vein of raj anglo-european cooking. ringed around burrabazar and bhowanipur were also the street foods of north india, marwar and gujarat-bombay, not to mention the south indian joints near the enclave of lake market. growing up as a doubly local-yokeled kid - south cal and non-bong vegetarian - life had in wait a lot of taste surprises for someone like me. i still remember the taste of the first non-amul cheese, in a sandwich at a french-american couple's house on pretoria street, some hard cheese, probably emmental because it had holes, like in the foreign comics, with - i now realize - a thin scrape of dijon mustard; the first taste of proper french red wine in delhi as a teenager; the shock of a proper pizza while visiting america; the first taste of guinness with the tangle of extreme bitter and subtle sweet that could compete with any karela sabzi. across life, one got to learn that, just as it's possible for many people to be at home anywhere, everybody but almost everybody is a provincial, a local-yokel, during their first years, no matter whether those years are spent in a floating market on the mekong or a chateau in mdoc. in this regard, a sudden memory pops up. my mother was a fine cook of gujarati food and many non-gujju friends became devotees of the various, classic snack items she'd make. in the mid-1990s, one such friend was working in dhaka when i travelled to meet her. the loud and repeated request was for me to bring a stack of my mother's much sought after theplas (spiced paratha-type flatbread). i duly took along a box packed with theplas and, since it was ramazan, a few of these were placed alongside the several other items where the iftar feast was laid out. the thepla fan burst into effusive excitement when she saw the discs loaded with methi leaves and all sorts of spices, and immediately grabbed one. our host, a sophisticated, upper-class bangladeshi woman, much travelled and widely exposed to the different foods of the world, also picked up one. as i watched, she took a bite and her head snapped back in shock and revulsion. she quickly put down the offending thing and put distance between herself and the ecstatically mumbling thepla fan. at first i was deeply offended - it was as if my bangladeshi friend had insulted my mom. but then i thought back at all the electrified rejections and ejections i had made of alien tasting food across my life, not least all sorts of supposedly great bengali fish, and i calmed down. like me, my mother, too, couldn't stand any smell of fish, uncooked or cooked. but she would have had equal if not greater revulsion for some of the things i've grown to love, from mutton curry and roast pork to finely sliced carpaccio of raw beef and bresaola. thinking back, what offended me about my bangladeshi friend's reaction was that, in my mind, she was after all a desi and not some bland-palate foreigner, and one who wasn't inexperienced in eating spicy subcontinental vegetable preparations, nor desi breads including, i imagine, rotis, luchis and dhakai parathas. again, another neutralizing memory collides with this one, of when i first went to non-bombay, proper maharashtra in my mid-twenties. it was in pune, one morning, that i asked for a cup of tea at a roadside stall. by now i'd had 'indian-style tea' in many parts of northern and eastern india;

Suffering from back-to-back drought for two years, demonetisation has struck a severe blow.I am sure it will be sometimes before a clearer picture emerges. But all efforts to paint a bright picture for agriculture are now beginning to fall apart. While the serpentine queues in the urban areas show no signs of ending even after a month of demonetisation, the picture in the rural areas remains too bleak. With the bank branches not getting adequate cash, I know of villages where the farmers had to return empty handed even after seven days of queuing up.What makes it worse is the fact, as Prof Ram Kumar of Tata Institute of Social Studies points out, that nearly 81 per cent of the villages do not have access to bank branches.Despite the Ministry of Agricultures claim of a higher sowing of rabi crops as compared with the area sown in previous year, reality checks portray a different picture. The area under wheat sowing was being deliberately compared with the sowings accomplished in 2015, the year of drought. When you compare 17.4 million hectares of wheat sowing achieved by December 4, with the corresponding figures of 21.3 and 20.9 mn hectares in 2013 and 2014 respectively, it reveals the shortfall.While much had been written about the difficulties encountered by the farmers in undertaking sowing operations, they faced severe blow when the market crashed post demonetisation. Even a month after, the mandis in several cities are partially operating.With the demand subdued, prices have fallen across the board Only a day ago, farmers in Paththal town in Chhattisgarh dumped tomatoes on the national highway to express their discontent at the decrease in prices. With trucks failing to arrive this year, the rich tomato pocket of Chhattisgarh saw prices lowering to 50 paise per kg. Again, a few days back, farmers distributed potatoes free-of-cost outside the Vidhan Sabha in Lucknow.Vegetable and fruit growers have been hit the hardest with prices slumping to as low as 45-50 per cent. Cauliflower in Bihar and tomato in Andhra Pradesh were selling at `1 per kg; nearly three lakh tonnes of potato seed in cold storages in Punjab found no buyer; dairy farmers found themselves at the receiving end on failing to buy fodder for cattle. Many such reports have been pouring in from across India. With no government succor, arhtiyas (money lenders) came to farmers rescue at many places, especially after the cooperative banks or societies became non-functional.Considering that 2016-17 witnessed a normal monsoon except in Karnataka and parts of Telengana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, I was expecting some kind of revival in the farm economy.Knowing that the farmers are not being paid a remunerative price for years, they have to depend on the rain gods to bail them out of dire situation. And this year, the rain gods didnt disappoint.

Around six lakh people were affected by floods in Allahabad, reports said.As the floodwater entered thousands of houses trapping the inmates inside, the administration sought help of the IAF personnel to drop food packets and water bottles in the affected areas. In Varanasi, the Lok Sabha constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Ganga was flowing 121 cm above the danger mark and its water has entered many localities in the town. Its tributaries Varuna and Assi were also flowing above danger marks. Boats have been plying in dense localities in the town.Movement of vehicles on the Mirzapur-Allahabad highway came to a halt after floodwater damaged the roads at many places. Teams of National Disaster Response Force have been deployed in the flood-affected districts.Gives birth on boatIn Banda district of Bundelkhand region, a woman gave birth on a boat late on Monday while being taken to hospital. Shankarpurwa, the village which the woman belongs to, was marooned owing to floods.The state government has directed district magistrates to visit the flood-affected areas and monitor the relief and rescue operations.Officials have been asked to coordinate relief efforts with the IAF personnel.The toll in the flood related incidents has gone up to 30. Two people drowned in Ken river after their car was swept away in Banda district on Tuesday, sources said.Vegetable prices skyrocket after floodsEven though the Ganga and its tributariesSone and Punpunhave started showing a receding trend in the last 36 hours, vegetable prices in and around the state capital have skyrocketed, DHNS reports from Patna.The reason is that a large part of the diara areas (riverine belt) and surrounding villages in central Bihar, which grow huge quantity of vegetables, remain largely submerged due to swollen rivers. This has resulted in leafy vegetables going out of stock. The prices of those which are available like ladies finger, brinjal, tomato, parwal, green chillies and coriander have increased by 30 to 50%.The steep hike is primarily because the vegetable-producing areas like Fatuha, Bakhtiyarpur and Raghopur remain submerged due to the overflowing Ganga and its tributaries. Patna is like a saucer. It is surrounded by three rivers with Ganga/Gandak on the north, Sone in the west and Punpun in the south. With all the rivers in spate, most of thevegetable- producing areas are underwater, explained Suresh Kumar, a retailer.","flood hits 15 lakh in uttar pradeshsanjay pandey, lucknow, aug 24, 2016, dhns 0:23 istmonsoon fury: death toll reaches 30; iaf help sought to supply foodaround 15 lakh people reeled under the impact of floods in uttar pradesh, especially the eastern and central districts, including two major towns  varanasi and allahabad.according to reports, as many as 30 people lost their lives in flood-related incidents in different parts of the state in the past few days.in the sangam town of allahabad, the water from the overflowing ganga has entered several localities, forcing the administration to order closure of all schools up to class xii for the next two days. around six lakh people were affected by floods in allahabad, reports said.as the floodwater entered thousands of houses trapping the inmates inside, the administration sought help of the iaf personnel to drop food packets and water bottles in the affected areas. in varanasi, the lok sabha constituency of prime minister narendra modi, the ganga was flowing 121 cm above the danger mark and its water has entered many localities in the town. its tributaries varuna and assi were also flowing above danger marks. boats have been plying in dense localities in the town.movement of vehicles on the mirzapur-allahabad highway came to a halt after floodwater damaged the roads at many places. teams of national disaster response force have been deployed in the flood-affected districts.gives birth on boatin banda district of bundelkhand region, a woman gave birth on a boat late on monday while being taken to hospital. shankarpurwa, the village which the woman belongs to, was marooned owing to floods.the state government has directed district magistrates to visit the flood-affected areas and monitor the relief and rescue operations.officials have been asked to coordinate relief efforts with the iaf personnel.the toll in the flood related incidents has gone up to 30. two people drowned in ken river after their car was swept away in banda district on tuesday, sources said.vegetable prices skyrocket after floodseven though the ganga and its tributariessone and punpunhave started showing a receding trend in the last 36 hours, vegetable prices in and around the state capital have skyrocketed, dhns reports from patna.the reason is that a large part of the diara areas (riverine belt) and surrounding villages in central bihar, which grow huge quantity of vegetables, remain largely submerged due to swollen rivers. this has resulted in leafy vegetables going out of stock. the prices of those which are available like ladies finger, brinjal, tomato, parwal, green chillies and coriander have increased by 30 to 50%.the steep hike is primarily because the vegetable-producing areas like fatuha, bakhtiyarpur and raghopur remain submerged due to the overflowing ganga and its tributaries. patna is like a saucer. it is surrounded by three rivers with ganga/gandak on the north, sone in the west and punpun in the south. with all the rivers in spate, most of thevegetable- producing areas are underwater, explained suresh kumar, a retailer."
5922e1377be9e01fd59ac32b,Extending shelf-life: Israel offers post-harvest management expertise in F&V,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/extending-shelf-life-israel-offers-post-harvest-management-expertise-in-fv/,2016-06-09,,Indian Express,"Edna Pesis (left) and Susan Luria. Edna Pesis (left) and Susan Luria.After drip irrigation-cum-fertigation, tissue culture and protected cultivation of vegetables, fruits and flowers, dissemination of Israeli post-harvest know-how is the latest focus of the Indo-Israel Agricultural Project (IIAP).Value-addition in horticultural crops is not just about processing and selling juices. It is also about technologies to maintain the quality of fresh produce for delivering in that form to consumers in distant locations or to harvest, say, pomegranates in September for selling in the US or Europe during the Christmas and New Year season, points out Susan Lurie, professor emeritus at the Department of Postharvest Science of Fresh Produce in the Agricultural Research Organization of Israels Ministry of Agriculture.Israel, according to her, has lot to offer to India when it comes to preservation of quality  texture, appearance, colour, taste, aroma, and nutritional and health attributes  of fresh farm produce, especially for exports to foreign markets.Most of what we produce  from cherry tomatoes and capsicum to mangoes, bananas, pomegranates, lychees, guavas and papayas  is for selling outside Israel. Unlike us, India is big and more like the US, where they grow in California to sell in New York or Boston. Theres no reason you cannot do the same here, which is where we can help, adds Lurie.Edna Pesis, an expert from the same department that is said to be the worlds largest research centre for post-harvest management, illustrates this through the example of mangoes. Mangoes are susceptible to diseases after harvest and prolonged storage, as a result of psychological changes occurring in the fruits that enable fungal pathogen development.An effective means to address the problem is through hot water brushing treatment  spraying a jet of water at about 52 degrees Celsius for 15-20 seconds on the harvested fruits in packing lines. This is followed by drying and waxing or wrapping the fruits with a layer of organic/synthetic waxing material. Hot water brushing significantly reduces decay from fungal development, while waxing prevents water loss that leads to shrinkage and premature ripening of the fruits. Both together help improve the keeping quality and general appearance of the mangoes in supermarket shelves.These apart, there are also other technologies like modified atmosphere packaging that involves covering the fresh produce with special permeable plastic films to reduce humidity. Fruits and vegetables are naturally respiring products, resulting in the condensation of their vapours into water and lowering shelf life. The mistake many people do is to take the harvested fruits directly to the cold storage. Doing that can cause not only shrinkage, but also makes the fruits prone to scalding and chilling injury, explains Pesis.The two Israeli women scientist-experts are part of a visiting team under the IIAP, a programme currently operational in nine states: Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. We are now extending this to six other states: Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Mizoram and Goa, says Dan Alluf, Counsellor (Science & Agriculture) with Mashav, Israels Agency for International Development Corporation.The IIAP, which is a joint collaboration between Mashav and the Indian governments Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture plus the participating states, is being implemented via centres of excellence.Currently, there are 14 such fully active centres: four in Maharashtra (for citrus, pomegranate, and Alphonso and Kesar mangoes), three in Haryana (vegetables, citrus, pomegranate and mango), two in Gujarat (Kesar mango and vegetables), two in Rajasthan (pomegranate and citrus), two in Punjab (vegetables and citrus) and one in Tamil Nadu (vegetables).The programme began in 2009. Our aim is to have 26 centres of excellence in all the participating states, which would act as the catalyst for showcasing Israeli agricultural technology/know-how and taking these to farmers fields. The new areas we are looking at are post-harvest management, water recycling for agricultural use, agricultural machinery and organic farming, informs Alluf.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now","edna pesis (left) and susan luria. edna pesis (left) and susan luria.after drip irrigation-cum-fertigation, tissue culture and protected cultivation of vegetables, fruits and flowers, dissemination of israeli post-harvest know-how is the latest focus of the indo-israel agricultural project (iiap).value-addition in horticultural crops is not just about processing and selling juices. it is also about technologies to maintain the quality of fresh produce for delivering in that form to consumers in distant locations or to harvest, say, pomegranates in september for selling in the us or europe during the christmas and new year season, points out susan lurie, professor emeritus at the department of postharvest science of fresh produce in the agricultural research organization of israels ministry of agriculture.israel, according to her, has lot to offer to india when it comes to preservation of quality  texture, appearance, colour, taste, aroma, and nutritional and health attributes  of fresh farm produce, especially for exports to foreign markets.most of what we produce  from cherry tomatoes and capsicum to mangoes, bananas, pomegranates, lychees, guavas and papayas  is for selling outside israel. unlike us, india is big and more like the us, where they grow in california to sell in new york or boston. theres no reason you cannot do the same here, which is where we can help, adds lurie.edna pesis, an expert from the same department that is said to be the worlds largest research centre for post-harvest management, illustrates this through the example of mangoes. mangoes are susceptible to diseases after harvest and prolonged storage, as a result of psychological changes occurring in the fruits that enable fungal pathogen development.an effective means to address the problem is through hot water brushing treatment  spraying a jet of water at about 52 degrees celsius for 15-20 seconds on the harvested fruits in packing lines. this is followed by drying and waxing or wrapping the fruits with a layer of organic/synthetic waxing material. hot water brushing significantly reduces decay from fungal development, while waxing prevents water loss that leads to shrinkage and premature ripening of the fruits. both together help improve the keeping quality and general appearance of the mangoes in supermarket shelves.these apart, there are also other technologies like modified atmosphere packaging that involves covering the fresh produce with special permeable plastic films to reduce humidity. fruits and vegetables are naturally respiring products, resulting in the condensation of their vapours into water and lowering shelf life. the mistake many people do is to take the harvested fruits directly to the cold storage. doing that can cause not only shrinkage, but also makes the fruits prone to scalding and chilling injury, explains pesis.the two israeli women scientist-experts are part of a visiting team under the iiap, a programme currently operational in nine states: punjab, haryana, rajasthan, gujarat, maharashtra, karnataka, tamil nadu, bihar and uttar pradesh. we are now extending this to six other states: andhra pradesh, telangana, madhya pradesh, west bengal, mizoram and goa, says dan alluf, counsellor (science & agriculture) with mashav, israels agency for international development corporation.the iiap, which is a joint collaboration between mashav and the indian governments mission for integrated development of horticulture plus the participating states, is being implemented via centres of excellence.currently, there are 14 such fully active centres: four in maharashtra (for citrus, pomegranate, and alphonso and kesar mangoes), three in haryana (vegetables, citrus, pomegranate and mango), two in gujarat (kesar mango and vegetables), two in rajasthan (pomegranate and citrus), two in punjab (vegetables and citrus) and one in tamil nadu (vegetables).the programme began in 2009. our aim is to have 26 centres of excellence in all the participating states, which would act as the catalyst for showcasing israeli agricultural technology/know-how and taking these to farmers fields. the new areas we are looking at are post-harvest management, water recycling for agricultural use, agricultural machinery and organic farming, informs alluf.for all the latest india news, download indian express app now"
5923bb327be9e01fcef057b4,RBI should go for low interest rates,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/537652/rbi-should-go-low-interest.html,2016-03-30,,Deccan Herald,"Upendra Goel Mar 31, 2016, 0:01 ISTOnly growth has the potential to cure our financial ailments, and boost Make In India programme too.Growth can waitseems to be the favourite refrain of RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan. Before the previous NDA government demitted office in 2004, it had been successful in bringing down the interest rates to low levels. The economy and business sentiments were also booming at that time.Later on, inexplicably, interest rates were increased by more than a dozen times during UPA-II, particularly when D Subba Rao was the RBI governor. It is no secret that high interest rates cripple business, especially industry. The good returns on fixed deposits and other savings instruments also encourage the public to put money into savings instead of trying to recycle earnings for some productive work.This way, on one hand you are incentivising people by providing higher returns for keeping the surplus funds dormant, while on the other hand the costly finance provided by financial institutions dampens the spirits of business as well as entrepreneurship.Both the anomalies can be rectified by a simple remedy of reducing the interest rates. The automobiles, housing, realty and so many allied sectors will witness a kick start towards growth immediately. Not for nothing the Central Bank of Japan has introduced a negative interest regime on earnings  if you want to keep money in the savings, you will have to give bank some amount as charges as a punishment for not putting it to some productive use. The European Banks have been practicing it for at least 10-11 years now.Naturally, when the new government took over on the plank of development, the first thing the business expected it to do was to reduce interest rates as one of the initial steps to spur growth. As the demand for softening the interest rates grew louder, the dampener came from Rajan: First, we have to tackle inflation, growth can wait. Now it is the 15th consecutive month the WPI (whole sale price index) is negative and the prices of crude have touched rock bottom. All industrial products and items have been seeing negative inflation. Still no signs of interest rate reduction.Edible itemsThe only thing which remains costly is the edible items. God alone knows how does one tackle inflation of agricultural products by controlling interest rates. One may not buy a car or a house for higher interest rates, but would anybody stop buying potato or tomato even if the interest rates were 100%? Whatever small decrease in interest rates during last one year or so is too little.As the clamour for interest rate reduction continued to grow and the inflation logic did not hold good any more, Rajan came up with another one: The government has to tackle the fiscal deficit first, only then interest rates can be lowered, the growth can wait.Then just a few days ago, he said: If you ask me what is more important, growth or cleaning of banks balance sheets, I would say cleaning of banks balance sheets has to take priority. Grow-th can wait. And his latest masterstroke: We will not devalue our currency for increasing exports, the way China, Japan and Korea did. Growth can wait.Seems growth is the last thing on the RBI governors agenda or perhaps it is not there in his priority list at all. One is at a loss to understand that the government which came to power with such a huge mandate on the plank of development and for bringing acche din, seems to be not bothered about the growth at all. All the gains in the sectors of power, defence, railways, highways etc will be lost if they are not backed with solid reforms in financial sector.Sadly, there have been hardly any positive or thoughtful steps taken by finance ministry in last 21 months. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also has to appreciate that Make in India would not happen by mere rhetoric. The windfall gains because of increase in excise duty on petroleum products, coal block auctions and 3G spectrum auctions are keeping the government coffers full, making it complacent, whereas the dismal performance in direct and indirect tax collections should have rung alarm bells.When the IIP (Industrial Production Index) is shrinking, WPI is negative, sensex is falling, NPAs (non productive assets) are mounting and the banks bad loans are increasing to staggering proportions  no amount of treatment will help.Neither bringing of black laws like Bankruptcy Code 2015, will help. Rajan should have been the one piloting the engine of growth while he was proving to be the one permanently red-flagging the growth. His hawkish approach to the economy has proved to be disastrous. It is to be understood that it is only growth which has the potential to cure our financial ailments, and the momentum thus gained will give boost Make In India programme as well.The juggernaut of growth, which when unleashed, automatically pulls all the parameters of the economy to their desired slots. No stone should be left unturned including reduction in interest rates, to spur gr-owth. Because, development or growth cant wait.

593cc4447be9e00e964d386d,PM Modi’s interview with Arnab Goswami: Full transcript,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/pm-modis-interview-with-arnab-goswami-full-transcript-2879832/,2016-06-28,,Indian Express,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an interview with Times Now has shared his views on a range of issues. Here is the complete transcript of the Prime Ministers interview with Arnab Goswami.ARNAB: Prime Minister Modi thank you very much for this interview. Thank you very muchPM MODI: My greetings to all the peopleARNAB: This is your first one to one interview to a private news channel since you became Prime Minister. And if I am not mistaken, this is the first ever interview by a sitting Prime Minister of India to a private television news channel in the country. So I would first like to thank you and am very grateful for the opportunity.PM MODI: The world of the media has grown so big that everybody has to attach themselves with it.Watch Video: Whats making newsARNAB: I am very grateful and our viewers will be very grateful also Mr Modi because they want to hear your views on a range of subjects. Mr Prime Minister I would like to start by taking you back to 20th May 2014. The results came on May 16th. Four days later, you gave a historic speech in the Central Hall of Parliament and you were speaking to the members of Parliament. You had said four days after the results that an era of responsibility has begun. And that you said that in 2019 before the elections, I will come back to this Parliament, I will come back to the MPs and I will give my report card. Forty percent into your tenure, how much have you achieved of your own targets?PM MODI: When I went for the first time as an MP to the Central Hall, and it was the first time I was seeing the Central Hall. I had not been there before. So I had then said that becoming the Prime Minister was not about the designation of the office but it was about the responsibilities and work of being a PM. I had also said that my government would be committed to the poor. I was completely new in the job. Delhi was new for me. The Delhi environment was new to me. The work of the government of India was also new for me. But despite that, in such a short time, the pace at which the country has moved forward, and its not on one subject. You can pick up any aspect of the governments functioning, and if you make a comparison with the past governments, then you will realize that no issue has been ignored. There has been an effort to bring in something new in every area. There is an effort to bring in change in every area. One big challenge was that I was not experienced about this place, I had not even been an MP. The office was new, the questions were also new. But when I look at the second biggest challenge, we should remember those days when the country was engulfed in disappointment. The everyday news was about whether there would be any electricity production after seven days, whether coal would be supplied or not. This was the situation then. The entire system was engulfed in disappointment. The big challenge was to inject new trust into the system and create confidence among the citizens. It is very difficult to evaluate this from the outside but I have gone through it. But today I can say with a lot of satisfaction that now there is no trace of any disappointment. The intention to do something is visible. And its not in words but in actual achievement. I had said that within a given timeframe, we will open bank accounts for the poor. For something that had not been done for 60 years, setting a timeframe for it was in itself a risk. But because of that a trust was created in the system that it was something doable. So thats the process I started for awakening the confidence. And today you can see that in every sector, the changed circumstances can be seen. While evaluating the performance of this government, never forget that you will have to make that evaluation in comparison with the 10 years of the previous government. Only then will you know where we were and where we are now. We should not be talking about what we are aiming for. For now you will have to assess the present in comparison with the immediate past and in that you will find a bright future.ARNAB: Mr. Modi, I want to start now on the issue of foreign policy. In the area of foreign policy, you have taken great personal interest. The amount of personal interest you have shown in foreign policy, probably none of the previous Prime Ministers showed the same kind of interest. Your approach is pro active. What I find interesting about your foreign policy is that you have balanced different powers and different interests. On the one side, your relationship with US, you made sure that India enters the Missile Control Technology Regime with them. A week before that you also signed the historic Chabahar Port Agreement with Iran. So, you have balanced very diverse forces. My question to you over this is that, is it easy to do that as an Indian Prime Minister? Secondly, on the issue of the NSG, you staked a lot of personal interest, personal push, you lobbied actively. How close are we to getting the NSG seat?PM MODI: Firstly, about foreign policy, you need to know what has strengthened our foreign policy. For 30 years, in our country, the government was unstable. For 30 years, party with a clear mandate wasnt given the opportunity to form the government. The world measures the government of a nation on the basis of its condition in its own country, on how strong their word is in their own country. I am thankful to the people of this country, that after 30 years, they chose a government with absolute majority and this has had an impact on world politics. Countries and world leaders have changed their perspective towards India. This is the biggest benefit. Secondly, the world didnt know me. The world wants to know who the head of the state is. If someone would want to know Modi through the eyes of the media, then he would be disillusioned on which modi is the real Modi. If this happens, the country will be at a loss. Modis personality shouldnt be a hindrance for the world to have faith in india. But for that unless I meet all those leaders and engage them them one to one, unless I speak to them frankly, they wouldnt know about indias head of state, so it was very important for me as I am not from a political family. I never had the opportunity to meet the world leaders earlier.ARNAB: You were an unknown entity in foreign policyPM MODI: More than foreign policy it was foreign relations. Yes, I was new to it. So for me, being pro active was mandatory. Thirdly, we work as a team. Foreign ministry, Prime Ministers officer, commerce ministry, finance ministry, defense minister, everyone works as a team, not as separate pieces. The impact that is now visible, is not just because of Modi, it is because of the team. All teams work in a particular direction. That is why the impact is seen, earlier these teams were splintered. We have seen instances where the party would give a statement, the prime minister would say something else, party leaders would say something else. This disunity has had a negative impact. Thirdly, we also need to understand that earlier the world was bi polar. Foreign policy would be centered around two super powers. India was a little late in realizing that this bi polar situation was for namesake. Now the entire world, in changed circumstances, especially in 21st century, it is more interdependent and inter connected, earlier, the foreign policy was possible between governments, but today it is not possible just between governments. Government relations are important but increasing people to people contact is equally important. Theres been a shift in paradigm. Because I do not have any previous baggage, because Ive had a clean slate, I write everything from beginning and that has a benefit. Today we are building relations with countries across the world. The amount of respect with which I engage saudi arabia, I engage Iran with the same amount of respect. The amount of respect with which I speak to America, I speak to russia with the same amount of respect. So we need to understand this. We also need to understand that we shouldnt consider smaller countries insignificant. I abide by this principle. The small countries of the world are as important as the big nations. We had assumed that the relations with smaller nations would develop under the shadow of the bigger nations. I brought about a change in this. You must have seen that I made a forum for the pacific island nations. We have had two meetings. I went there once and they came here once. These are small countries with a population of about 10 lakh or 20 lakh. But these small island nations are most affected by global warming. When india took up the international solar mission and 122 nations joined it, the island nations benefitted the most out of it. They are 50 in number now. A group of 50 nations, feels secured with this vision of India. If we try to understand this change, then we would realize that in the world, a few days back, I was sitting with the officers of our foreign services, so as we got talking, in a very poetic way I told them that there was a time when we used to sit by the sea and count the waves, but the time has now changed, we are done counting waves, now its time for us to steer ourselves, ride the waves and decide on our direction, destination and speed.ARNAB: That is apparent. You have a very aggressive foreign policy. But my second question was, you put so much effort for NSG membership. My question was, how close are we to NSG membership and were you disappointed that we did not make it at the very end because of Chinas opposition?PM MODI: Look the first thing is that India has been continuously making these efforts, no matter which government was in office. Be it the membership of the UN Security Council or the SCO membership or MTCR membership or NSG membership. Every government has made an effort. Its not that only this government is trying, its in continuity. But its during our tenure that we achieved SCO membership, we also got the MTCR membership. I have full faith that now we have begun a coordinated effort for the NSG membership too. The process has begun on a positive note. Everything has rules and will work accordingly and move forwardARNAB: Is it the problem of mindset with China? There have been 13 engagements at various levels between the Narendra Modi government and the Chinese government. The latest engagement was when you went to Tashkent. You spent some time with the Chinese President Xi Jinping. Yet it was seen that in the case of Masood Azhar, China blocked Indias UN bid to ban him. Now they have stalled Indias NSG bid. Why is China repeatedly blocking us Mr Prime Minister despite your personal proactive measures and your governments outreach?PM MODI: The first thing is that we have an ongoing dialogue with China and it should continue to happen. In foreign policy its not necessary to have similar views to have a conversation. Even when the views are contradictory, talks are the only way forward and problems should be resolved through dialogue. We dont have one problem with China, we have a whole lot of problems pending with China. Slowly and steadily, an effort is on to address these issues through talks and make them less cumbersome. I can say that China has been cooperating with India to search for solutions. On some issues, its a question of principles for them. On some issues, its a question of principles for us. On some issues they differ with us and there are issues on which we differ with them. There are some basic differences. But the most important thing is that we can speak to China eye-to-eye and put forth Indias interests in the most unambiguous manner. We are a government that takes care of Indias interests. We dont compromise on this. Three days ago I met the Chinese President. I told him clearly about Indias interests. They are a different country, we are a different countryARNAB: Do you think you will be able to change their mindset on the issue of NSG membership?PM MODI: See the foreign policy is not about changing mindsets. Foreign policy is about finding the common meeting points. Where do our interests converge and how much? We have to sit and talk with every country. Its our ongoing effortARNAB: This statement that you just made is also apt in the context of America where you gave a speech in the U.S Congress. By the way Mr Prime Minister it was a fantastic speechPM MODI: Thank youARNAB: There was a lot of humour. You were laughing and cracking jokes while you delivered the speech which was very unique. They also appreciated it. Was the speech impromptu?PM MODI: I have a humourous side but these days humour can be a risky thingARNAB: Why do you say that?PM MODI: In this era of 24/7 news channels, anybody can lift a small word and make a big issue out of it. But I will tell you the truth, the reason for the absence of humour in public life is this fear. I am myself scared . Earlier when I used to make speeches, I would make it so humourous but there would never be any issuesARNAB: Have you become more conscious now?PM MODI: I am not conscious. I am in fear, there is no humour left in public life because of this fear. Everyone is scared. I am in fear. My speeches used be humourous. I see it in Parliament, that humour is finished there too. It is a matter of concern. I will quote one proverb.ARNAB: Yes, go ahead.PM MODI: Even if you mention a proverb, they will connect it with something else and begin a conversation. The one who is saying the proverb does not know for what he is speaking.ARNAB: But you should not lose your sense of humour Mr Prime MinisterPM MODI: But it is true that my trip to the United States of America, my speech in their Congress and the respect shown towards India created a lot of hype. Had it not been hyped so much, there would not have been so much criticism on the NSG issue. Government is being criticized not for any mishandling of the NSG issue but because we were so successful over there (in the USA)ARNAB: Did China become conscious of your growing friendship with US?PM MODI: I am talking about whats happening hereARNAB: But when you delivered that speech in context of America, you used a very interesting phrase. You said We have to overcome the hesitations of history. My Hindi is not that good. Like hesitations of history. But my question to you is Mr Prime Minister, how close can we get to America because many Indians believe that America is still supporting Pakistan, giving them military assistance. How close can we get? At what point do we stop before we are seen like an American ally? What is your own world view on that?PM MODI: I would especially like to appeal to my countrys media that we should stop looking at everything in India from the . India is an independent country. It is a country of 125 crore people. Whenever it approaches any country, it will only be concerned about its own interests. It has been our biggest shortcoming and mistake that we have been tagging ourselves with another country and trying to do things. We are an independent country, we have our own policies and future. We have to think about the future of our 125 crore people. There should be no compromise on our interests. We have relations with America in the context of these fundamental pointsARNAB: How close can we get to them?PM MODI: There has been warmth in our relationship. You must have seen the editorials in American newspapers after my visit to that country. One point mentioned in those editorials was that the success of Obamas foreign policy has been the warm relationship with India. This has been saidARNAB: What you are saying Modiji is that we can be close to America but we need not be an ally or seen to be an ally?PM MODI: The first thing is that we no longer live in a bipolar world. The world is interconnected and interdependent. You will have to connect with everybody at the same time. Even if there are two opposing countries, they will have to be friends. Now the times have changedARNAB: Mr Modi, on 8th May 2014, I had the opportunity to interview you, the interview took place in Ahmedabad, I think one last phase of elections was left. We were discussing the issue of Pakistan. You have had an uncompromising approach towards Pakistan. Two days back, Lashkar E Toiba killed 8 CRPF jawans in an attack. In the 8th May interview, you put forth a very interesting phrase, you said Can talks be heard amidst the noise of bombs, guns and pistols? This is how you had phrased it. Do you believe we have been too generous towards Pakistan? Do you believe we have been too generous towards Pakistan?PM MODI: There are two things. One  India has always wanted friendly ties with its neighbours, there can be no debate around it. We want to live in harmony and peace. And I have said it repeatedly, that India has to fight poverty, Pakistan too has to fight poverty, why dont we come together to fight poverty? I said this before elections and during election campaigns. Also I had invited leaders of SAARC nations to my swearing in ceremony and they had attended it as well. So there has been no change in our intent, our thoughts and our current behaviour. Number two  those who have to work from the table, will work from the table and those who have to work at the border, will work at border with full strength. Each one will fulfill the responsibility entrusted to them. And our jawans are fulfilling their responsibilities. Its true that pressure on terrorists has increased, their schemes are proving unsuccessful. The intent with which they move forward are foiled and they have to face major challenges. It is because of this disappointment that such incidents are taking place and our jawans are risking their lives and protecting the country. We are very proud of our JawansARNAB: When your foreign policy is studied, observers analyze whats happening and whats not happening. If you give me the opportunity, I want to do a bit of analyses. There was a terrific pace of engagement with Pakistan between October, November and December. On 30th November, you met Nawaz Sharif on the sidelines (of UN Climate Summit in Paris). Both of you were seated on a sofa, talking to each other. A lot of people were speculating the contents of your conversation. This was on the sidelines of Climate Summit. After that, all of a sudden within seven days there were NSA level talks and Ajit Doval spoke to Nasir Janjua in Bangkok. And again after that you went to Russia via Afghanistan, you made an unexpected visit to Nawaz Sharif in Lahore. It was a personal trip but it still had some level of importance. Eight days later, Pakistani terrorists attacked Pathankot. Can you tell our viewers whether Pakistan was proactively responding in the months of October, November and December? Did the Pathankot terror attack change the situation? Is it true that Pakistan was making a lot of movement in those three months?PM MODI: Look there are different types of forces operating in Pakistan. But the government only engages with a democratically elected system. Our effort for that engagement is continuing. But our supreme objective is peace. Our supreme objective is to protect Indias interests. We keep making effort toward that objective and sometimes our efforts are successful. As far as meetings and talks are concerned, we signalled right from the day I took oath and sent invitations for the oath taking ceremony, that we seek friendly relations but without compromising on our interests. And that is why I have said that my countrys soldiers have full freedom to answer back in whatever manner they have to and they will keep doing thatARNAB: Mr Prime Minister what is the Lakshman Rekha that you would draw when it comes to Pakistan. There is some confusion surrounding this subject. I would like you to give an elaborate reply. In 2014, it was believed that if talks are being held, then they should be held between two countries and not with Hurriyat. It should be between the government of India and the government of Pakistan. The other Lakshman Rekha is that you must act on 26/11. Theres been no forward movement so far. The third thing is about forward movement on the Pathankot attack case. So what is the Lakshman Rekha now and if Pakistan remains within those bounds, so talks can happen at the political level or at any other level?PM MODI: The first thing is that with Pakistan, to whom do we talk to decide about the Lakshman Rekha. Will it be with the elected government or with other actors? That is why India will have to be on alert all the time. India will have to be alert every moment. There can never be any laxity in this. But there is an outcome due to my continuous efforts like my visit to Lahore and my invitation to the Pakistani Prime Minister to come to India. Now I dont have to explain to the world about Indias position. The world is unanimously appreciating Indias position. And the world is seeing that Pakistan is finding it difficult to respond. If we had become an obstacle, then we would have had to explain to the world that we are not that obstacle. Now we dont have to explain to the world. The world knows our intentions. Like on the issue of terrorism, the world never bought Indias theory on terrorism. They would sometime dismiss it by saying that its your law and order problem. Today the world has to accept what India has been saying about terrorism. Indias dialogue on terrorism, the losses India has suffered due to terrorism, the losses suffered by humanity, the world is now acknowledging that. So I believe we have to take this process forwardARNAB: Mr Prime Minister I now want to move to questions on the economy. In the past two years you have started many schemes. If we look at the theme of Jan Dhan Yojna for financial inclusion, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna for crop insurance, Swach Bharat, Skill India, Make In India. If we see the theme running through these schemes, is your social agenda at the core of your personal economic philosophy, social transformation? Is the social agenda at the core of your economic philosophy as the Prime Minister?PM MODI: The first point is our philosophy is to reach the last man in the line. Pandit Deendayal Upadhyays philosophy forms the core of our political, economic and social ideology. And even Mahatma Gandhi used to say that what is there for the last man? So my development parameter is very simple. It is about how the poorest of the poor can benefit from development. The poor is the central focus of my economic agenda. The poor should be strengthened in such a way that they get the willingness to defeat poverty. By helping the poor make ends meet while they remain in poverty is also one of the ways. I am not saying right or wrong but its one of the ways. But today the countrys situation is such that we should make the poor strong so that they become partners in defeating poverty. All these schemes are meant to empower the poor and change the quality of life. The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna is not only about opening bank accounts for the poor. Because of this the poor are feeling that they are becoming a part of the countrys economic system. The bank that he was seeing from afar, now he is able to enter that bank. This brings about a psychological transformation. Looked at in another way, did you ever imagine that 40 thousand crores could be injected into the banking system by contributions from the poor. The poor who never had bank accounts, have deposited 100 rupees, 50 rupees or 200 rupees. It means that poor man saved 100 rupees and the change began in his life. We have taken up construction of toilets. I had gone to Chhattisgarh and had the opportunity to get the blessings of one mother. An adivasi mother heard about the scheme for building toilets. She sold her four goats and built a toilet. That 90 old mother uses a walking stick and goes around the cluster of 30 or 40 houses in the tribal village and has been spreading the message to build toilets. This change is becoming the reason for the change in the quality of life. I have begun the cleanliness campaign. Its estimated an individual spends an average of 7000 rupees for treatment of a disease. The main reason for disease is filth. The poor suffer the most from the filth. If a poor man falls sick, he cannot drive his rickshaw for two days and his children go hungry. So how can we help the poor bring about change in their lives? Now there is a neo-middle class and a middle class in the country. The young have their aspirations. So another aspect of my policies you must have seen are the Start Up India, Stand Up India, Seaport activity, port activity, railways expansion, railway station upgradation. These changes directly appeal to the middle class. The middle class has its aspirations. We have to create jobs? How will job creation happen? Till I invest in the development of infrastructure, there be no job creation. You must have seen that the maximum electricity generation since Independence has occurred this year. The maximum amount of coal mined has been in this year. The maximum length of roads being constructed daily is happening in this year. The fastest loading and unloading of steamers at sea ports is happening now. All these changes are creating opportunities for employment like in Start up India, Stand Up India. For instance in Stand Up India, I have said that every bank should give an economic opportunity to one woman, one dalit or one tribal person to become entrepreneurs. This will create many job opportunities. So this is the basis of my economic philosophy.ARNAB: Mr Prime Minister if I could interrupt you on this. On the one hand is the peoples expectations and on the other is your vision. Many programs that you have mentioned, you cant put a calendar date to it but they dont have an immediate impact. They maybe able to show results in 3, 4, 5 maybe beyond 5 years. Now there are challenges in that. Mr Prime Minister, you are aware more than anyone else that people want immediate results. Now you spoke of job creation. The first thing, as an achievement you have managed to grow the economy at 7.5 per cent when the global economic climate is very bleak. You have spoken about it as well. You have met fiscal deficit targets, FDI inflows have increased but people are saying that job opportunities are not increasing. You have spoken about infrastructure but the current rate of unemployment. Mr Prime Minister, the latest Labour Bureau figures, is it a source of concern for you as the Prime Minister?PM MODI: The first thing is that are 800 million people below the age of 35 in our country. We have to accept that the demand for jobs is very high. But where will they get employment? Investment will come in. It will be used in the infrastructure sector, manufacturing and services sector. Now like the initiative we have taken, we have started the Mudra Yojna. More than three crore people in the country comprise washermen, barbers, milkman, newspaper vendors, cart vendors. We have given them nearly 1.25 lakh crore rupees without any guarantee. Now why have these people taken the money? To expand their work. When he expands his work, if he is currently employing one person, now he has to employ two people. If there were two employed earlier, now there are three. Now just think, when 3 crore of these small businesses have got access to finance, they must have expanded their work. Now all this is not in the Labour Departments registration. Three crore people have expanded their work. We took another small decision. The big malls in the country run 365 days a year but the smaller shops have to close on holidays. We announced in the Budget that even a small shopkeeper can operate his shop till late night and that too on all the seven days of the week. If the malls dont have restrictions then why should the small shopkeepers have restrictions. So now if a shopkeeper operates his shop till late and on all seven days, if he earlier employed one person, now he will have to employ two people. So wont the employment increase?ARNAB: So is your focus on entrepreneurship?PM MODI: Our focus is on all aspects. Now we are saying that by 2022 we want to ensure that everyone has a house. Housing sector has the maximum potential for creating employment. Houses will be built in such huge numbers, how many people will get employment? You must have seen that last year we brought in a textile policy. Under this textile policy, there will be income tax benefits for those who create employment. The more employment one creates, the more tax benefits they will get. For the first time, employment generation and tax has been linked. These are the things that boost employment and our central focus is creating employment for the ordinary citizenARNAB: Mr Prime Minister, questions are also being raised on food inflation which has still not decreased. The expectation was that the food inflation would decline. The people had put their hopes on the Prime Minister that you will bring down prices. This not only has a political impact but also has a social impact. Over the past two weeks, there were reports that in some places the price of Arhar dal had touched 150 rupees and 200 rupees for other pulses. The price of tomatoes was also rising. Is this only seasonal because the food inflation is increasing at 7.5 per cent year on year. Global oil prices have fallen. Do you think this creates perception issues for your government?PM MODI: You cant view inflation as a perception issue. Price rise should be seen as a reality. What is available for a consumer should be seen for what it is. There should never be an attempt to view price rise as a perception issue as a means of escaping the reality of price rise. We will have to accept reality. You see the fast pace at which prices were rising under the previous government, today that speed has decelerated a lot. You can see the statistics, you will find it there. Second, the country has gone through two consecutive years of severe drought. Drought has a direct impact on the price of vegetables, food and pulses because all these things are produced from the soil. Now when there is such a big drought, its not in anybodys hands. The second option in such a situation is imports. The Indian government has imported pulses in huge quantities. Third, it is the joint responsibility of the state and Central governments. It is not exclusively the states responsibility. It is not exclusively the Centres responsibility. It is the joint responsibility of both the state and Central governments. This should not be an issue of blame game that the state government did not do certain things and that the Centre did not do certain things. But it will have to be agreed that it is the joint responsibility of both. That is why the Centre has given rights to the states to make stringent laws. How much stocks to keep or not to keep are decisions which the states can take. All these rights have been given to the states. Some states have performed well, some states are trying. But the Centre and state governments are trying to work together on this. I believe that we have been successful to the extent that the speed with which prices were rising (under UPA), what would have happened if the prices were to rise at that speed. We have been successful in stopping that speedy rise of prices. But as far as pulses are concerned, production in India has been very low. Many farmers who were earlier sowing pulses have started cultivating sugar. That is also an area of concern. We gave special incentives for pulses. We have tried to set up a different MSP for pulses. We have taken steps to procure pulses from farmers with bonus. Our focus is on increasing the production of pulses. We are also focusing on building stocks of pulses by importing from abroad. An all out effort is being made and I believe that nobody doubts the sincerity of this governmentARNAB: Mr Prime Minister what is your view about the controversy around the exit of Raghuram Rajan as the RBI Governor? A lot has been spoken about this. There was commentary that it may effect Indias image, perception as a global economy. Whats your own view of the controversy around the exit of Raghuram Rajan?PM MODI: When my Government was formed in May 2014, you take newspapers from May, June, July 2014 and check television debates during that period. The topic of the television debates would be  Will the new govt let Raghuram Rajan continue? Or Will the new Government oust Raghuram Rajan? And there was more or less consensus that he was appointed by the previous govt and so Modi wont let him complete his tenure and will remove him. You have seen, that he worked his entire tenure. For the time he was appointed by the previous government, he completing his entire term. So all the misconceptions have been dispelled. Secondly, according to my 2 year experience in Govt, those who are creating controversies, are being unjust to Raghuram RajanARNAB: Why so?PM MODI: I will tell you. Those who sayI believe Raghuram Rajans patriotism is no less than any of ours. It will be doing injustice to him if one says that he will serve the country only if he is at a particular post. As much as I know Raghuram Rajan, whatever post he holds, wherever he is, he is someone who will continue to serve the country. He is someone who loves his country. Therefore, its not like the nation wont get Raghuram Rajans services, Raghuram Rajan is not that kind of a person. He is a person who loves the country. Those who speak such language are doing great injustice to him. My experience with him has been good.I appreciate the work he has done. And my good wishes will always be with himARNAB: Prime Minister Modi, theres a question related to this. During your speech at the Executive you used seven words begining with letter S Sevabhaav (service), Santulan (balance), Sanyam (restraint), Samvaad (dialogue), Samanvay (coordination), Sakaratmak (positivity) and Samvedna (sensitivity). I will ask the question in context with Raghuram Rajan because you used these words in the speech at National Executive Meet speech on June 14 in Allahabad. You said, Our party leaders and party workers should use these qualities in their daily dealings and behaviour. Prime Minister, in Raghuram Rajans context, your Rajya Sabha MP has made many comments. Later he made critical remarks against senior bureaucrats. My question is, do you think it is right? When we talk about Sanyam (restraint) and Santulan (balance), is it correct?PM MODI: Whether it is someone from my party or not, I believe that such things are inappropriate. The nation wont benefit from such publicity stunts. One should be more responsible while conducting themselves. Anyone who believes he is bigger than the system is wrong.ARNAB: Thats a very clear message.PM MODI: I have a very clear message. I have no two minds about it.ARNAB: And Mr Prime Minister, if I may say so, between May 8 and now, you are speaking as straight as you did before you took over as Prime Minister. I think that answer takes me to the next subject. Mr Prime Minister, the issue is that of Black Money. In a very interersting way you said, prices should not be looked at from the point of percepetion, equally, Mr Prime Minister it can be said said that an issue like Black Money should not be looked at in terms of perception, but it is perception forming. There are political debates on this. Experts say that the Black Money economy has shrunk, 10-15% economy has shrunk through land dealings and other things. You have passed the Black Money Bill, you have made taxation more transparent, you have started information sharing with other countries, you have taken steps, but Prime Minister Modi, people still expect that a Rs 25 lakh crores will be brought back and put into their bank accounts. How will you address that expectation? The hope that people have taking Black Money, how will you address it?PM MODI: How did the black money issue arise and how did it become such a serious issue? We have to look at the background. It is an established fact in the minds of the common man those who steal money park their money overseas. Its a common perception. Even if I look at it from the common mans perspective, I also wonder where does this money go? This issue was always stalled in the Parliament. When the matter reached the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court ordered Special Investigation Team to look into it, even then the previous government stalled it for three years, from 2011-2014. Its after this that political parties, the media and the common man started believing that theres something wrong. Then the issue of Black Money became an agenda. Even today I can saythat yes, when there is money stashed in foreign accounts, there are some norms of engagement with foreign countries on the issue. But between 2011-2014, these people were given the opportunity to launder money here and thereARNAB: And you also said on 17 February 2015 on this issue, that the then Law Minister is only offering lip servicePM MODI: The result was that people got several chances to launder money. Secondly, after our Government was formed, the first decision taken by our Cabinet was to form a Special Investigation Team to bring back Black Money which was pending despite Supreme Courts 2011 order. This shows our sincerity. From then on, you cant imagine how stringent the laws have been made to bring back Black Money and whoever comes in its fold will know how strict the law is. Thirdly, I attended the G20 Summit. Never was Black Money issue discussed in the G20 forum. It was my first G20 summit, for the first time I met the world leaders. And for the first time in the G20 Summit, one paragraph was on unaccounted money, on black money and 20 countries said that the world should cooperateBlack. The dirty money, black money was also linked to terrorism, an environment of global census was created. We have been signing agreements one after the other with different countries that there will be real time, automatic exchange of information with India. I recently visited Switzerland and there was minimal discussion on the issue. But after I returned, a big delegation from Switzerland visited India, and they held meeting with the Indian Government and we discussedfor several years, we believed that Switzerland is the place where black money is stashed, that country is holding discussions to come to a consensus on Automatic Information Exchange and if we reach consensus it will be a great achievement. Thirdly you mustve seen that Mauritius route came up in almost everything. It was said that money goes out of India and returns through the Mauritius route. This was discussed. Everyone thought that nothing can be done about the Mauritius route.But our Government held a dialogue with the Mauritius Government, made changes to the old treaty. And we successfully made a new treaty to block the money which comes through the Mauritius route and very soon it will be phased out and completed. All these decisions are taken to fight the Black Money menace. This is not a one sided fight. Secondly, the govt is working in a direction to make sure that Black Money isnt generated in India and black Money doesnt go out of India, you can see the results of all this.ARNAB: When the opposition raises the Rs 15 lakh issue.PM MODI: That is something the opposition raises during elections. Let them have some issue to talk aboutARNAB: Mr Prime Minister, there has been no major financial corruption or scam in your tenure in the last two years. Perception is again, what people say is because you keep a very tight control on the reins of Government but the question is there are people, who are wilful defaulters, the economic offenders who take a lot of money from the country or commit economic offences in the country, go overseas and use rules and use lawyers, and they dont come back to India. And people are asking now, is the Narendra Modi Govt determined to take these cases of wilful defaulters and economic offenders to their logical conclusion.PM MODI: Firstly, this question is not in the minds of people. The people of India have confidence that if theres someone who can do this, it is Narendra Modi and he will do it. Citizens of the country have full faith.ARNAB: Does it worry you, that people have misued the law?PM MODI: I take this as an opportunity and I will show them what the law is.ARNAB: Mr. Modi, there have been several corruption cases about the previous government, which have now come out. There is AgustaWestland, many defense scams and defense transactions are now being analyzed seriously. The cases which were quoted in the CAG reports but were ignored are now coming in the forefront. This question is important because this isnt just about financial corruption but these questions have direct implications on the national security of the country. Do you think, when they say that this is a political witch hunt by Narendra Modi Sarkar, do you think all of these cases would have been possible without political patronage?PM MODI: There are many things which are not visible. One cant imagine the difficulty I am experiencing in taking out things from dirt. One who is working there knows the amount of dirt that exists and how certain things have been caught in a web. There are certain powers behind it. The case about Agusta helicopters. I cant deny it and I believe that we have the right to doubt that people behind this are very experienced. They have perfectly practiced the art of doing wrong deeds. They are very experienced and knowledgeable. And one can also smell the fact that such a thing wouldnt have been done without a shield. Now, agencies are probing. Lets see how far the probe goes. But the investigation shouldnt go ahead while people are being targeted, neither does my government target anyone. The sin has been committed, but how much is done, How was it done, who did it, probe agencies will find out in a professional way. Whatever comes out, will be put outARNAB: Prime Minister, talking about your speech in the US Congress, and the humour that you displayed. I felt some of it was impromptu. But the Americans were able to relate to what you said, I dont remember the exact words, you said, I am informed that the working of the US Congress is harmonious. And then there was a pause and people were laughing. Then you said, I am told  You emphasized and said I am told that you are well known for your bipartisanship. Then the applause was more. And then you said, You are not alone. Time and again I have witnessed a similar spirit in the Indian Parliament. You spoke about a serious topic in a interesting manner. You referred to the Upper House. There was a lot of response on that too. Your humour was really appreciated and I think it was a wonderful moment when you were speaking. But, Mr. Prime Minister, when you look back at the parliament, this question comes to many peoples minds, has Prime Minister Narendra Modi being held back from achieving his own objectives because of the non-stop parliamentary logjam. How much has this affected his moving towards his own targets? If you critically analyze this situation, do you feel your government could have been more consultative or do you feel the blame is entirely with the Opposition?PM MODI: I look at it differently. I believe there have been a lot of problems. Whether the fault is ours or theirs, I ll leave it to the people. People will decide. But because of discussions in Parliament  we may not come to a decision, the decision could be opposing our view, nothing wrong in that. But at least there should be a discussion. The sad part is, if somebody is running away from debate or dont let discussions happen, then it is a cause of worry in a democracy. Whether the governments work is accomplished or not, I dont see it as a cause of worry. If not today, it will happen tomorrow. There are certain things which will happen at an administrative level. The big thing is, Parliament is for discussion. Parliament is to show dissent. Parliament is to give an argument for ones opposition, to present an argument when they support.To uphold this basic spirit of Parliament, is the responsibility of every person who values democracy. It is the responsibility of those present in the Parliament and those outside. It is the responsibility of those in power and those not in power. This is a matter of spirit and it should be followed. As far as the government is concerned, on every issue and at every forum, we have tried to hold discussions. I myself have met the opposition leaders and spoken to them. Key members of the government are also in touch. And you must have seen that many issues have been resolved. In the last session, we have passed 12 bills in Rajya Sabha, we passed 10 bills in the Lok Sabha. So the pace has picked up. When people say Opposition, it is unfair to the opposition. There are some parties in the Parliament which are not with the BJP or NDA, but are with the government on key decisions. So, to defame the Opposition by saying that all opposition parties are against us  when some people do this, it is wrong. There is one party which has problems. And the whole world knows that party. Secondly, to say that When you were is Opposition, you did it this way There is a difference between every Opposition party. We have run the government for 60 years and now we are in the Opposition, so we know the nitty-gritties of the government, we know the responsibilities. We cant behave in the way, a new Opposition party behaves. A party which hasnt been in power or hasnt seen anything, could behave in this way. For example, we are in power now, and consider in 2040 we become the Opposition party. So, in 2040 we cant have the same conduct as the one we had in 2009 or 2010.ARNAB: Congress is a very experienced and old partyPM MODI: Thats why I say that, those who have been in power for so many years, shouldnt be doing this. If there is a new party in the Opposition, they have a small demand for their state or if an MP has a demand for his/her constituency and does something like this, then we can understand. Ones who have been in power for very long, shouldnt be doing such thingsARNAB: Prime Minister Modi, do you think the GST bill which has been stuck for over one and half years, it is a path-breaking economic reform. It unifies the country. Recently you met Ms Jayalalithaa after she was sworn in as the Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee has extended her support for GST and Congress allies at the state level are supporting the GST bill. Do you feel optimistic that GST bill will be passed in the next session of the Parliament?PM MODI: First we need to understand, that we look at GST only within the purview of an economic reform because of which the right information doesnt come out. Not having GST straight away means loss for the poor of Uttar Pradesh. Absence of GST straight away means loss for the poor people of Bihar. Not passing the GST would mean loss for the poor people of poor states like Bengal, Orissa and Assam. People who sit in the Rajya Sabha must understand this. GST is beneficial for the poor people of the states represented by them, because those states will economically benefit the most from GST. The money will be used for the welfare of the poor people of those states. This is why be it Mamata Banerjee, be it Nitish Kumar, be it Akhilesh Yadav or Naveen Patnaik, all these states want the GST bill to be passed at the earliest. There is just one group which has made it the issue of prestige. Now the kind of arithmetic which is working out, I hope that this decision is passed in favour of the poor. You will be surprised to what extent has the opposition reached to the level of distortion. In the previous session we introduced an act. Indian government has Rs 40,000 crore rupees from the CAMPA Fund. Rs 40,000 crore. we wanted to give that money to the states. States have to use that money for forestry, for greenery, for planting trees and plants. The bill is meant for that. Had this Rs 40,000 crore reached the states before the monsoons, it would have been used for the forests. A lot of people would have got employment, people who plant trees would have been employed. There would be plantation and due to the rains the plants would start growing within a year. But just because of obstructionism, states have been deprived of the benefit of Rs 40,000 crore. The money was meant for the forests and for the tribals. They blocked it. There was no argument on itARNAB: The reasonyou had triedPM MODI: Made all efforts.ARNAB: You had invited former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi here at the Race Course RoadPM MODI: We held talks at every levelARNAB: Still? The word you used ego issue, why has it become an ego issue? And people would want to know why is the Prime Minister unable to end this?PM MODI: The Prime Minister cannot answer this question. Those creating obstructions can only answer this question. But despite this, I will keep trying. I am ready to convince them in which ever way possible. If I have to convoke someone over a cup of tea at their house, I am even ready for that. I have no problem. My only aim is the welfare of the poor of my country and the poor of states like Uttar Pradesh.ARNAB: You spoke of Uttar Pradesh. Mr Prime Minister, elections will be held in Uttar Pradesh in 6,7,8 months. The focus of entire nation will be on it. You are the MP from Varanasi. But some comments are made by BJP, some say Sangh Parivar, some independent groups, communal colour is added to it and not just from one party but from other parties as well. Mr Prime Minister are you going to be able to keep development as the sole agenda? The main issue in the Uttar Pradesh polls should be that of development, it shouldnt get capsized, the focus shouldnt be elsewhere. Are you confident that communal agenda will not overpower development?PM MODI: Its my conviction, its my commitment. You must have seen during the 2014 elections that I fought elections on the issue of development. The new generation of the country only believes in development. I believe that solution to all problems is in development. Development is also the solution to the tension that people talk about. If we provide employment to people, if we ensure theres food on their plates, if we provide them with facilities and give them education, all the tension will end. And this is why, all those who want good for the nation, I request them to compete towards development and for development. This atmosphere should be created in the country and I think such an environment is being created nowadays.ARNAB: So the hot heads who make extreme comments, is there a necessity to control them? So that there is no politics in the name of religionPM MODI: Firstly, I am of the firm belief that the nation should progress on the issue of development. And it is necessary that the country moves forward on the issue of development. I would like to tell the media not to make heroes out of those people who make such comments.ARNAB: But they keep making such commentsPM MODI: Dont make them heroes, they will stopARNAB: We dont make them heroes, we make them villains.PM MODI: But why do you make them so big? I see such statements by people on TV, whose faces I havent even seen and they end up becoming spokesmen on TVARNAB: Self styled spokesmenPM MODI: I dont know why such people are encouragedARNAB: Mr Prime Minister, lets talk in 2016 of the 2017 elections. After Delhi, then Bihar, then Assam, West Bengal. After that we will talk about Punjab. Before we finish talking about Punjab, we will talk about Uttar Pradesh. Then there is the Gujarat state election. Dont you think that this country is permanently stuck in an electoral cycle? The focus constantly and I want you to reflect on this issue, the focus is on party politics, polarising issues, not on governance. We are a country, if we say, we are constantly in a political campaign mode. Is this a good thing? Should we break away from it? And what is your view on it?PM MODI: See this is not an issue about Narendra Modi or the Prime Minister. And also it is not an issue about a particular party or a particular Government.But before the last Parliament session, the Speaker had called all the parties for a meal. After the agenda meeting everyone was sitting to eat. I had also reached at the same time. While talking casually over food, almost people from all parties said that the central and state elections must be held together. Everyone said it. After that during the farewell function of the Rajya Sabha MPs, people from different parties were talking with each other. One of the leaders said, Modiji do anything but get us out of this cycle of elections.ARNAB: Was that leader from your party?PM MODI: No, he was not from my party. So I said that discussion should happen. What is wrong in that? Then one day I said that this was being talked about. This issue has also been discussed in a Parliamentary committee. This work has also been started by the Election Commission and I think they have also writen a letter on it. Like in the fight against black money, this issue of elections also gets connected to black money. Electoral reforms are necessary if the country has to be rid of black money. It is one of the areas for electoral reforms. I believe that the Prime Minister cannot take a decision on this and nor should he do that. Neither the government can do this.There should be a broad discussion on this and we should not run away from the debate on this continious cycle of elections. The Indian voter today is very mature. He votes in one fashion in the Lok Sabha elections, he votes in a different manner in the State Assembly elections. We have seen this. In 2014, the General Elections conincided with the Odisha Assembly elections. The same electorate gave one judgement for Odisha and another judgement for Delhi. So this countrys voter is very mature and we should trust his maturity. There should be a debate on how costs can be reduced by holding simultaneous elections, how the influence of black money can be curbed, how the five years can be spent in taking the country forward. Today due to the model code of conduct, there is a loss even in those areas where the code is not applicable.When I was in Gujarat, I found that at least 80 to 90 officers were spending two to three months on election duties in other states. This could be happening in every state. So this is an area of concern and some time or the other this question will have to be thought of. I would want the Election Commission to take this debate forward. They should invite all political parties and hold discussions with everybody and whatever comes out of it.ARNAB: Can there be a timebound resolution in this?PM MODI: The Election Commission will have to invite all political parties to discuss this. The process will get derailed if one party were to initiate this.ARNAB: Are you willing to take the lead in building that consensus?PM MODI: Despite being the Prime Minister, I still belong to a political party. The better thing would be for the Election Commission to initiate this. Today the Election Commission is a very prestigious institution in our country. Every political party believes in the Election Commission and it will further empower this institution and that will be better.ARNAB: I think it is an interesting idea of simultaneous elections. Though state parties, regional parties may feel that it will effect them badly. That the national parties like the BJP will gain.PM MODI: Odisha is the best example. Odisha is the best example. In 2014, the BJP had no advantage in the state but the BJP won on the Lok Sabha seats. This shows the difference.ARNAB: Mr Prime Minister how are you keeping your schedule nowadays? I mean you keep a terrifying pace. The number of meetings you hold, people say your officers find it hard to keep up.PM MODI: It is not so, it has been 2 years now and everyone is used to the work. I believe that it is such a big country that one must do as much work as possible. So I keep doing that.ARNAB: Before I come to my last question Mr Prime Minister, one issue that I want to come to is the farmers crisis. As you are well aware, there has been a crisis in this country, you referred to it. In that speech to your MPs, about which I asked you earlier as well, on 20th May in the Central Hall of Parliament you said that this government is not for myself, this government is for the poor, we must do something for them. The farmers crisis Mr Prime Minster is a reality. I am glad that in this interview you have not avoided the reality, youve faced it, youve talked about it. We have linked our entire future to the monsoons. How do we overcome this from becoming an annual crisis in this country?PM MODI: We will have to put stress on water management here. You must have seen that under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayi Yojana, we have put stress on water issues. During these drought days, I met leaders from 11 states separately and sat with them for about 2-3 hours each. The country would have believed that their Prime Minister is working even if I had held a meeting with 11 of them together for around 10 minutes. But I didnt do that. I sat with leaders from different states separately to understand specific problems and what we could do for water in those states. I am happy, whichever party the state government affiliated to, all the governments focused a lot on water issues this summer.We will reap its benefits this monsoon. Using scientific methods for water accumulation and irrigation, collecting water and directing them towards the fields, everyone did that. Micro irrigation is stressed upon. Even for sugarcane farming, farmers are slowly moving towards micro irrigation which earlier happened through flood irrigation. Paddy crops for which large amount of water is used. Today, farmers have started using drip irrigation for it. If we do well in water facilities, then one of the problems is solved. After independence, for the first time, we have brought in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana which can cover maximum number of farmers. The farmer will have to pay only 2%, only 2%, the government will take care of the rest. The farmers will get an assurance. For instance, in Maharashtra, the monsoons are expected in the month of June, the farmers have prepared for everything but havent started with the sowing process. Now if there are no rains till August, so practically his crops have not been damaged, because he did not sow the seeds.But the Pradhan Mantri fasal Beema Yojana even takes this into consideration and benefits the farmer. Another important aspect, once the crops are harvested, theyre cut and kept in the field, assuming it has been a good year for crop growth, with 100% crop production, but it hasnt been loaded on trucks and sent to the market yet. And if it rains, even after 15 days of harvesting, if there is loss, it is covered under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana. Second layer of protection, minimum premium with maximum cover. After independence, for the first time, we have brought in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana. Thirdly, first time we have brought in E-Mandi concept. Farmer in the village, can sell the crops to the best markets in the country through his mobile phone. Farmer would set the price at which the crop would be sold. Earlier, farmers used to take the produce on carts or tractors, used to go to a mandi 20-25kms away, then due to storage issues, even if they had to sell for Rs 10 less than the price, they used to sell it. Now, sitting at home the farmer would know what price to sell the crops at. Next point is about, food processing, value addition. We opened up 100% foreign direct investment in food processing.For example, if a farmer is selling tomatoes and if a company is processing tomato ketchup then my farmers would benefit from it. The companies that make aerated drinks, Coca-Cola, Pepsi etc, I requested them to add 5% natural fruit juice. In regions near Nagpur and Vidarbha where oranges are cultivated, Coca-Cola is going to add 5% of orange juice. If we add 5% natural juice to aerated water, farmers would get their market and their fruits wouldnt go waste. We should have a comprehensive all-out scheme. So much of our land has been damaged. We have brought in Soil Health Card. We have a Soil Health Abhiyan. The farmer will know the fertility of the land through it. Whether a fertilizer needs to be used or not, the farmer will understand. On an average, a farmer with 1 hectare of land will be able to save Rs 15000-20000. So we have brought in scientific methods. You would know that in our country, farmers used to be lathicharged when they would go to buy urea and they had to buy it in black. We got urea 100% neem coated. Earlier, urea used to go to chemical factories, and the government subsidies were stolen in the name of farmers. After neem coating, urea cannot be used for any other purpose except farming.Because of neem coating, there is a qualitative change which helps in healing the damaged land. Due to neem coating a piece of land that used 10 kgs of urea can now manage with 7 kgs of urea. All these initiatives are in the direction of agriculture and the resuARNAB: Do you think that the farmers crisis will be resolved, the question I asked, that it wont be an annual affair, the dependence on monsoons will go down?PM MODI: See agriculture is a state subject. The Indian government has taken initiatives, if the state government are enthusiastic to implement this, which I think they will be. As I told you I met leaders from different states and they worked a lot for water issues. If this works, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana has direct involvement of the central government, it will have great benefits.ARNAB: Mr Prime Minister now I have two questions for you.PM MODI: This has become too long.ARNAB: Ill club these two (questions) together. Youre also enjoying it and I am glad youre speaking Mr Prime Minister because there is so much ground to cover and I think viewers would like to hear your view, sir. Actually there are three, if you allow me. Theyre short questions. First is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, how much is politics playing on your mind? In the sense that every Prime Minister, especially someone who is as forthright as you, looks at the next big challenge. Is 2019 anywhere in your mind?PM MODI: Those who have seen me in Gujarat, and those who have seen me in the last two years, those who see me without any bias, they will know that I am an apolitical Prime Minister. Apart from elections, I dont get involved into politics ever. You can call elections a necessity, a restraint or a responsibility, we have to do it. I attend many functions, go to different areas, you wouldnt have heard any political comment from me. If I go to a government function, I talk about government related topics. If I attend a Railways function I talk about railways, if water then water, if water bodies, then water bodies. My focus is on governance. Country has been at greatest loss because governments were run only for elections. Governments must not run only for elections. The government should be a bona fide attempt of meeting the demands and expectations of the common people. Elections should just be a bi-product. It is a democracy. Winning and losing is a part of it. It shouldnt be hyped. You would have seen recently I urged everyone to pay taxes before 30th September. I even said it on Mann Ki Baat yesterday. Will a person, who is only concerned with winning elections, say that post 30th September youd face problems?ARNAB: This was also a warning in a way.PM MODI: It is a warning. It is definitely a warning. It is a warning. My first warning is to my government officers to not presume citizens as thieves. I have already given this warning. I have handled my officers first. It took me quite some time. You will be shocked to hear that I have given an early retirement to more than 30 people from Income Tax Department on integrity issues. This isnt a small issue. People who werent transferred since 20 years, I got them transferred. So, one, my focus is on my system. Second, I also tell the country, that for the poor of the nation we would have to give out something for the poor in our country. It is my responsibility to give the people an account of every rupee. I will use it at right places. I wont let it get stolen. But if I need to give houses to the poor, we would need revenue. I dont want to increase taxes, I just want taxes to be paid honestly. There is no need to increase the taxes. The country can run without troubling the citizens. I am working towards it. That is why I have given the citizens a chance to pay the taxes till 30th September, whatever it is Rs 10,000 or Rs. 50,000. If they think they want to come into mainstream, they must and shouldnt be worried. After 30th September, the government will have to take steps. I will not worry about the polls. I will take the necessary steps. I want to work for the poor in my country.ARNAB: Mister Prime Minister, do some crystal ball gazing for the next three years. For the next three years, to use the cricketing analogy, how do you find your run rate so far and will you have to score at a higher run rate in the next three years to achieve your targets?PM MODI: See, no matte at what speed I move forward, I am never satisfied. If today I run at a speed of 100, I keep an aim of running at 200. I think that the world that was behind us, has gone ahead. We need to run a lot to match that level. So we do not need to calculate. We just need to give it all in. And I have given myself in completely. Ive been successful is pulling my entire government in. I believe that the country is also committed to move forwardARNAB: Final question to you Mr Prime Minister, what motivates you the most? First of all as I said, will you be able to keep this pace? What motivates you the most and also if you can share with our viewers honestly what is your one greatest source of worry?PM MODI: Firstly, I dont live under the burden of worries. Problems and challenges are there, you cant deny that. But you must challenge the challenges and not let the challenges turn into worries. This is my principle. I challenge the challenges. I like to face the problems. I dont run away from them. Whatever loss I have to face for it, I face it. But I cant leave the country helpless. This responsibility must be taken and I will continue to do so. For all good and bad things, it is my responsibility. I do not regret anything. I believe, people of the country have given me the responsibility and I must fulfill it. Thirdly, when I see the poor in our country, it reminds me of the work that I have to do for them. Day before yesterday, I was in Pune, and met a Shrimaan Chandrakant ji. A retired teacher with a pension of Rs 16000, donates Rs 5000 every month for Swachh Abhiyaan. If a 70 year old retired teacher with children and family at home, without worrying about them, worries about the country, then being the Prime Minister, I should work a thousand times more than Chandrakant ji. This is my inspiration. People of this country who work day and night, they are my inspiration. I look at them and I work even harder.ARNAB: Prime Minister Narendra Modi it has been a privilege. I am grateful for this interview.PM MODI: Thank youARNAB: And thank you on behalf of all our viewers that you spoke frankly. The program is Frankly Speaking and I am thankful to you that you were so frank.PM MODI: I just request you to not create controversies out of this but instead use it for the benefit of the country.ARNAB: Please do not think like that. Thank you very muchPM MODI: Thanks a lot. Thank you very much.ARNAB: Thank you very much.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd","prime minister narendra modi in an interview with times now has shared his views on a range of issues. here is the complete transcript of the prime ministers interview with arnab goswami.arnab: prime minister modi thank you very much for this interview. thank you very muchpm modi: my greetings to all the peoplearnab: this is your first one to one interview to a private news channel since you became prime minister. and if i am not mistaken, this is the first ever interview by a sitting prime minister of india to a private television news channel in the country. so i would first like to thank you and am very grateful for the opportunity.pm modi: the world of the media has grown so big that everybody has to attach themselves with it.watch video: whats making newsarnab: i am very grateful and our viewers will be very grateful also mr modi because they want to hear your views on a range of subjects. mr prime minister i would like to start by taking you back to 20th may 2014. the results came on may 16th. four days later, you gave a historic speech in the central hall of parliament and you were speaking to the members of parliament. you had said four days after the results that an era of responsibility has begun. and that you said that in 2019 before the elections, i will come back to this parliament, i will come back to the mps and i will give my report card. forty percent into your tenure, how much have you achieved of your own targets?pm modi: when i went for the first time as an mp to the central hall, and it was the first time i was seeing the central hall. i had not been there before. so i had then said that becoming the prime minister was not about the designation of the office but it was about the responsibilities and work of being a pm. i had also said that my government would be committed to the poor. i was completely new in the job. delhi was new for me. the delhi environment was new to me. the work of the government of india was also new for me. but despite that, in such a short time, the pace at which the country has moved forward, and its not on one subject. you can pick up any aspect of the governments functioning, and if you make a comparison with the past governments, then you will realize that no issue has been ignored. there has been an effort to bring in something new in every area. there is an effort to bring in change in every area. one big challenge was that i was not experienced about this place, i had not even been an mp. the office was new, the questions were also new. but when i look at the second biggest challenge, we should remember those days when the country was engulfed in disappointment. the everyday news was about whether there would be any electricity production after seven days, whether coal would be supplied or not. this was the situation then. the entire system was engulfed in disappointment. the big challenge was to inject new trust into the system and create confidence among the citizens. it is very difficult to evaluate this from the outside but i have gone through it. but today i can say with a lot of satisfaction that now there is no trace of any disappointment. the intention to do something is visible. and its not in words but in actual achievement. i had said that within a given timeframe, we will open bank accounts for the poor. for something that had not been done for 60 years, setting a timeframe for it was in itself a risk. but because of that a trust was created in the system that it was something doable. so thats the process i started for awakening the confidence. and today you can see that in every sector, the changed circumstances can be seen. while evaluating the performance of this government, never forget that you will have to make that evaluation in comparison with the 10 years of the previous government. only then will you know where we were and where we are now. we should not be talking about what we are aiming for. for now you will have to assess the present in comparison with the immediate past and in that you will find a bright future.arnab: mr. modi, i want to start now on the issue of foreign policy. in the area of foreign policy, you have taken great personal interest. the amount of personal interest you have shown in foreign policy, probably none of the previous prime ministers showed the same kind of interest. your approach is pro active. what i find interesting about your foreign policy is that you have balanced different powers and different interests. on the one side, your relationship with us, you made sure that india enters the missile control technology regime with them. a week before that you also signed the historic chabahar port agreement with iran. so, you have balanced very diverse forces. my question to you over this is that, is it easy to do that as an indian prime minister? secondly, on the issue of the nsg, you staked a lot of personal interest, personal push, you lobbied actively. how close are we to getting the nsg seat?pm modi: firstly, about foreign policy, you need to know what has strengthened our foreign policy. for 30 years, in our country, the government was unstable. for 30 years, party with a clear mandate wasnt given the opportunity to form the government. the world measures the government of a nation on the basis of its condition in its own country, on how strong their word is in their own country. i am thankful to the people of this country, that after 30 years, they chose a government with absolute majority and this has had an impact on world politics. countries and world leaders have changed their perspective towards india. this is the biggest benefit. secondly, the world didnt know me. the world wants to know who the head of the state is. if someone would want to know modi through the eyes of the media, then he would be disillusioned on which modi is the real modi. if this happens, the country will be at a loss. modis personality shouldnt be a hindrance for the world to have faith in india. but for that unless i meet all those leaders and engage them them one to one, unless i speak to them frankly, they wouldnt know about indias head of state, so it was very important for me as i am not from a political family. i never had the opportunity to meet the world leaders earlier.arnab: you were an unknown entity in foreign policypm modi: more than foreign policy it was foreign relations. yes, i was new to it. so for me, being pro active was mandatory. thirdly, we work as a team. foreign ministry, prime ministers officer, commerce ministry, finance ministry, defense minister, everyone works as a team, not as separate pieces. the impact that is now visible, is not just because of modi, it is because of the team. all teams work in a particular direction. that is why the impact is seen, earlier these teams were splintered. we have seen instances where the party would give a statement, the prime minister would say something else, party leaders would say something else. this disunity has had a negative impact. thirdly, we also need to understand that earlier the world was bi polar. foreign policy would be centered around two super powers. india was a little late in realizing that this bi polar situation was for namesake. now the entire world, in changed circumstances, especially in 21st century, it is more interdependent and inter connected, earlier, the foreign policy was possible between governments, but today it is not possible just between governments. government relations are important but increasing people to people contact is equally important. theres been a shift in paradigm. because i do not have any previous baggage, because ive had a clean slate, i write everything from beginning and that has a benefit. today we are building relations with countries across the world. the amount of respect with which i engage saudi arabia, i engage iran with the same amount of respect. the amount of respect with which i speak to america, i speak to russia with the same amount of respect. so we need to understand this. we also need to understand that we shouldnt consider smaller countries insignificant. i abide by this principle. the small countries of the world are as important as the big nations. we had assumed that the relations with smaller nations would develop under the shadow of the bigger nations. i brought about a change in this. you must have seen that i made a forum for the pacific island nations. we have had two meetings. i went there once and they came here once. these are small countries with a population of about 10 lakh or 20 lakh. but these small island nations are most affected by global warming. when india took up the international solar mission and 122 nations joined it, the island nations benefitted the most out of it. they are 50 in number now. a group of 50 nations, feels secured with this vision of india. if we try to understand this change, then we would realize that in the world, a few days back, i was sitting with the officers of our foreign services, so as we got talking, in a very poetic way i told them that there was a time when we used to sit by the sea and count the waves, but the time has now changed, we are done counting waves, now its time for us to steer ourselves, ride the waves and decide on our direction, destination and speed.arnab: that is apparent. you have a very aggressive foreign policy. but my second question was, you put so much effort for nsg membership. my question was, how close are we to nsg membership and were you disappointed that we did not make it at the very end because of chinas opposition?pm modi: look the first thing is that india has been continuously making these efforts, no matter which government was in office. be it the membership of the un security council or the sco membership or mtcr membership or nsg membership. every government has made an effort. its not that only this government is trying, its in continuity. but its during our tenure that we achieved sco membership, we also got the mtcr membership. i have full faith that now we have begun a coordinated effort for the nsg membership too. the process has begun on a positive note. everything has rules and will work accordingly and move forwardarnab: is it the problem of mindset with china? there have been 13 engagements at various levels between the narendra modi government and the chinese government. the latest engagement was when you went to tashkent. you spent some time with the chinese president xi jinping. yet it was seen that in the case of masood azhar, china blocked indias un bid to ban him. now they have stalled indias nsg bid. why is china repeatedly blocking us mr prime minister despite your personal proactive measures and your governments outreach?pm modi: the first thing is that we have an ongoing dialogue with china and it should continue to happen. in foreign policy its not necessary to have similar views to have a conversation. even when the views are contradictory, talks are the only way forward and problems should be resolved through dialogue. we dont have one problem with china, we have a whole lot of problems pending with china. slowly and steadily, an effort is on to address these issues through talks and make them less cumbersome. i can say that china has been cooperating with india to search for solutions. on some issues, its a question of principles for them. on some issues, its a question of principles for us. on some issues they differ with us and there are issues on which we differ with them. there are some basic differences. but the most important thing is that we can speak to china eye-to-eye and put forth indias interests in the most unambiguous manner. we are a government that takes care of indias interests. we dont compromise on this. three days ago i met the chinese president. i told him clearly about indias interests. they are a different country, we are a different countryarnab: do you think you will be able to change their mindset on the issue of nsg membership?pm modi: see the foreign policy is not about changing mindsets. foreign policy is about finding the common meeting points. where do our interests converge and how much? we have to sit and talk with every country. its our ongoing effortarnab: this statement that you just made is also apt in the context of america where you gave a speech in the u.s congress. by the way mr prime minister it was a fantastic speechpm modi: thank youarnab: there was a lot of humour. you were laughing and cracking jokes while you delivered the speech which was very unique. they also appreciated it. was the speech impromptu?pm modi: i have a humourous side but these days humour can be a risky thingarnab: why do you say that?pm modi: in this era of 24/7 news channels, anybody can lift a small word and make a big issue out of it. but i will tell you the truth, the reason for the absence of humour in public life is this fear. i am myself scared . earlier when i used to make speeches, i would make it so humourous but there would never be any issuesarnab: have you become more conscious now?pm modi: i am not conscious. i am in fear, there is no humour left in public life because of this fear. everyone is scared. i am in fear. my speeches used be humourous. i see it in parliament, that humour is finished there too. it is a matter of concern. i will quote one proverb.arnab: yes, go ahead.pm modi: even if you mention a proverb, they will connect it with something else and begin a conversation. the one who is saying the proverb does not know for what he is speaking.arnab: but you should not lose your sense of humour mr prime ministerpm modi: but it is true that my trip to the united states of america, my speech in their congress and the respect shown towards india created a lot of hype. had it not been hyped so much, there would not have been so much criticism on the nsg issue. government is being criticized not for any mishandling of the nsg issue but because we were so successful over there (in the usa)arnab: did china become conscious of your growing friendship with us?pm modi: i am talking about whats happening herearnab: but when you delivered that speech in context of america, you used a very interesting phrase. you said we have to overcome the hesitations of history. my hindi is not that good. like hesitations of history. but my question to you is mr prime minister, how close can we get to america because many indians believe that america is still supporting pakistan, giving them military assistance. how close can we get? at what point do we stop before we are seen like an american ally? what is your own world view on that?pm modi: i would especially like to appeal to my countrys media that we should stop looking at everything in india from the . india is an independent country. it is a country of 125 crore people. whenever it approaches any country, it will only be concerned about its own interests. it has been our biggest shortcoming and mistake that we have been tagging ourselves with another country and trying to do things. we are an independent country, we have our own policies and future. we have to think about the future of our 125 crore people. there should be no compromise on our interests. we have relations with america in the context of these fundamental pointsarnab: how close can we get to them?pm modi: there has been warmth in our relationship. you must have seen the editorials in american newspapers after my visit to that country. one point mentioned in those editorials was that the success of obamas foreign policy has been the warm relationship with india. this has been saidarnab: what you are saying modiji is that we can be close to america but we need not be an ally or seen to be an ally?pm modi: the first thing is that we no longer live in a bipolar world. the world is interconnected and interdependent. you will have to connect with everybody at the same time. even if there are two opposing countries, they will have to be friends. now the times have changedarnab: mr modi, on 8th may 2014, i had the opportunity to interview you, the interview took place in ahmedabad, i think one last phase of elections was left. we were discussing the issue of pakistan. you have had an uncompromising approach towards pakistan. two days back, lashkar e toiba killed 8 crpf jawans in an attack. in the 8th may interview, you put forth a very interesting phrase, you said can talks be heard amidst the noise of bombs, guns and pistols? this is how you had phrased it. do you believe we have been too generous towards pakistan? do you believe we have been too generous towards pakistan?pm modi: there are two things. one  india has always wanted friendly ties with its neighbours, there can be no debate around it. we want to live in harmony and peace. and i have said it repeatedly, that india has to fight poverty, pakistan too has to fight poverty, why dont we come together to fight poverty? i said this before elections and during election campaigns. also i had invited leaders of saarc nations to my swearing in ceremony and they had attended it as well. so there has been no change in our intent, our thoughts and our current behaviour. number two  those who have to work from the table, will work from the table and those who have to work at the border, will work at border with full strength. each one will fulfill the responsibility entrusted to them. and our jawans are fulfilling their responsibilities. its true that pressure on terrorists has increased, their schemes are proving unsuccessful. the intent with which they move forward are foiled and they have to face major challenges. it is because of this disappointment that such incidents are taking place and our jawans are risking their lives and protecting the country. we are very proud of our jawansarnab: when your foreign policy is studied, observers analyze whats happening and whats not happening. if you give me the opportunity, i want to do a bit of analyses. there was a terrific pace of engagement with pakistan between october, november and december. on 30th november, you met nawaz sharif on the sidelines (of un climate summit in paris). both of you were seated on a sofa, talking to each other. a lot of people were speculating the contents of your conversation. this was on the sidelines of climate summit. after that, all of a sudden within seven days there were nsa level talks and ajit doval spoke to nasir janjua in bangkok. and again after that you went to russia via afghanistan, you made an unexpected visit to nawaz sharif in lahore. it was a personal trip but it still had some level of importance. eight days later, pakistani terrorists attacked pathankot. can you tell our viewers whether pakistan was proactively responding in the months of october, november and december? did the pathankot terror attack change the situation? is it true that pakistan was making a lot of movement in those three months?pm modi: look there are different types of forces operating in pakistan. but the government only engages with a democratically elected system. our effort for that engagement is continuing. but our supreme objective is peace. our supreme objective is to protect indias interests. we keep making effort toward that objective and sometimes our efforts are successful. as far as meetings and talks are concerned, we signalled right from the day i took oath and sent invitations for the oath taking ceremony, that we seek friendly relations but without compromising on our interests. and that is why i have said that my countrys soldiers have full freedom to answer back in whatever manner they have to and they will keep doing thatarnab: mr prime minister what is the lakshman rekha that you would draw when it comes to pakistan. there is some confusion surrounding this subject. i would like you to give an elaborate reply. in 2014, it was believed that if talks are being held, then they should be held between two countries and not with hurriyat. it should be between the government of india and the government of pakistan. the other lakshman rekha is that you must act on 26/11. theres been no forward movement so far. the third thing is about forward movement on the pathankot attack case. so what is the lakshman rekha now and if pakistan remains within those bounds, so talks can happen at the political level or at any other level?pm modi: the first thing is that with pakistan, to whom do we talk to decide about the lakshman rekha. will it be with the elected government or with other actors? that is why india will have to be on alert all the time. india will have to be alert every moment. there can never be any laxity in this. but there is an outcome due to my continuous efforts like my visit to lahore and my invitation to the pakistani prime minister to come to india. now i dont have to explain to the world about indias position. the world is unanimously appreciating indias position. and the world is seeing that pakistan is finding it difficult to respond. if we had become an obstacle, then we would have had to explain to the world that we are not that obstacle. now we dont have to explain to the world. the world knows our intentions. like on the issue of terrorism, the world never bought indias theory on terrorism. they would sometime dismiss it by saying that its your law and order problem. today the world has to accept what india has been saying about terrorism. indias dialogue on terrorism, the losses india has suffered due to terrorism, the losses suffered by humanity, the world is now acknowledging that. so i believe we have to take this process forwardarnab: mr prime minister i now want to move to questions on the economy. in the past two years you have started many schemes. if we look at the theme of jan dhan yojna for financial inclusion, pradhan mantri fasal bima yojna for crop insurance, swach bharat, skill india, make in india. if we see the theme running through these schemes, is your social agenda at the core of your personal economic philosophy, social transformation? is the social agenda at the core of your economic philosophy as the prime minister?pm modi: the first point is our philosophy is to reach the last man in the line. pandit deendayal upadhyays philosophy forms the core of our political, economic and social ideology. and even mahatma gandhi used to say that what is there for the last man? so my development parameter is very simple. it is about how the poorest of the poor can benefit from development. the poor is the central focus of my economic agenda. the poor should be strengthened in such a way that they get the willingness to defeat poverty. by helping the poor make ends meet while they remain in poverty is also one of the ways. i am not saying right or wrong but its one of the ways. but today the countrys situation is such that we should make the poor strong so that they become partners in defeating poverty. all these schemes are meant to empower the poor and change the quality of life. the pradhan mantri jan dhan yojna is not only about opening bank accounts for the poor. because of this the poor are feeling that they are becoming a part of the countrys economic system. the bank that he was seeing from afar, now he is able to enter that bank. this brings about a psychological transformation. looked at in another way, did you ever imagine that 40 thousand crores could be injected into the banking system by contributions from the poor. the poor who never had bank accounts, have deposited 100 rupees, 50 rupees or 200 rupees. it means that poor man saved 100 rupees and the change began in his life. we have taken up construction of toilets. i had gone to chhattisgarh and had the opportunity to get the blessings of one mother. an adivasi mother heard about the scheme for building toilets. she sold her four goats and built a toilet. that 90 old mother uses a walking stick and goes around the cluster of 30 or 40 houses in the tribal village and has been spreading the message to build toilets. this change is becoming the reason for the change in the quality of life. i have begun the cleanliness campaign. its estimated an individual spends an average of 7000 rupees for treatment of a disease. the main reason for disease is filth. the poor suffer the most from the filth. if a poor man falls sick, he cannot drive his rickshaw for two days and his children go hungry. so how can we help the poor bring about change in their lives? now there is a neo-middle class and a middle class in the country. the young have their aspirations. so another aspect of my policies you must have seen are the start up india, stand up india, seaport activity, port activity, railways expansion, railway station upgradation. these changes directly appeal to the middle class. the middle class has its aspirations. we have to create jobs? how will job creation happen? till i invest in the development of infrastructure, there be no job creation. you must have seen that the maximum electricity generation since independence has occurred this year. the maximum amount of coal mined has been in this year. the maximum length of roads being constructed daily is happening in this year. the fastest loading and unloading of steamers at sea ports is happening now. all these changes are creating opportunities for employment like in start up india, stand up india. for instance in stand up india, i have said that every bank should give an economic opportunity to one woman, one dalit or one tribal person to become entrepreneurs. this will create many job opportunities. so this is the basis of my economic philosophy.arnab: mr prime minister if i could interrupt you on this. on the one hand is the peoples expectations and on the other is your vision. many programs that you have mentioned, you cant put a calendar date to it but they dont have an immediate impact. they maybe able to show results in 3, 4, 5 maybe beyond 5 years. now there are challenges in that. mr prime minister, you are aware more than anyone else that people want immediate results. now you spoke of job creation. the first thing, as an achievement you have managed to grow the economy at 7.5 per cent when the global economic climate is very bleak. you have spoken about it as well. you have met fiscal deficit targets, fdi inflows have increased but people are saying that job opportunities are not increasing. you have spoken about infrastructure but the current rate of unemployment. mr prime minister, the latest labour bureau figures, is it a source of concern for you as the prime minister?pm modi: the first thing is that are 800 million people below the age of 35 in our country. we have to accept that the demand for jobs is very high. but where will they get employment? investment will come in. it will be used in the infrastructure sector, manufacturing and services sector. now like the initiative we have taken, we have started the mudra yojna. more than three crore people in the country comprise washermen, barbers, milkman, newspaper vendors, cart vendors. we have given them nearly 1.25 lakh crore rupees without any guarantee. now why have these people taken the money? to expand their work. when he expands his work, if he is currently employing one person, now he has to employ two people. if there were two employed earlier, now there are three. now just think, when 3 crore of these small businesses have got access to finance, they must have expanded their work. now all this is not in the labour departments registration. three crore people have expanded their work. we took another small decision. the big malls in the country run 365 days a year but the smaller shops have to close on holidays. we announced in the budget that even a small shopkeeper can operate his shop till late night and that too on all the seven days of the week. if the malls dont have restrictions then why should the small shopkeepers have restrictions. so now if a shopkeeper operates his shop till late and on all seven days, if he earlier employed one person, now he will have to employ two people. so wont the employment increase?arnab: so is your focus on entrepreneurship?pm modi: our focus is on all aspects. now we are saying that by 2022 we want to ensure that everyone has a house. housing sector has the maximum potential for creating employment. houses will be built in such huge numbers, how many people will get employment? you must have seen that last year we brought in a textile policy. under this textile policy, there will be income tax benefits for those who create employment. the more employment one creates, the more tax benefits they will get. for the first time, employment generation and tax has been linked. these are the things that boost employment and our central focus is creating employment for the ordinary citizenarnab: mr prime minister, questions are also being raised on food inflation which has still not decreased. the expectation was that the food inflation would decline. the people had put their hopes on the prime minister that you will bring down prices. this not only has a political impact but also has a social impact. over the past two weeks, there were reports that in some places the price of arhar dal had touched 150 rupees and 200 rupees for other pulses. the price of tomatoes was also rising. is this only seasonal because the food inflation is increasing at 7.5 per cent year on year. global oil prices have fallen. do you think this creates perception issues for your government?pm modi: you cant view inflation as a perception issue. price rise should be seen as a reality. what is available for a consumer should be seen for what it is. there should never be an attempt to view price rise as a perception issue as a means of escaping the reality of price rise. we will have to accept reality. you see the fast pace at which prices were rising under the previous government, today that speed has decelerated a lot. you can see the statistics, you will find it there. second, the country has gone through two consecutive years of severe drought. drought has a direct impact on the price of vegetables, food and pulses because all these things are produced from the soil. now when there is such a big drought, its not in anybodys hands. the second option in such a situation is imports. the indian government has imported pulses in huge quantities. third, it is the joint responsibility of the state and central governments. it is not exclusively the states responsibility. it is not exclusively the centres responsibility. it is the joint responsibility of both the state and central governments. this should not be an issue of blame game that the state government did not do certain things and that the centre did not do certain things. but it will have to be agreed that it is the joint responsibility of both. that is why the centre has given rights to the states to make stringent laws. how much stocks to keep or not to keep are decisions which the states can take. all these rights have been given to the states. some states have performed well, some states are trying. but the centre and state governments are trying to work together on this. i believe that we have been successful to the extent that the speed with which prices were rising (under upa), what would have happened if the prices were to rise at that speed. we have been successful in stopping that speedy rise of prices. but as far as pulses are concerned, production in india has been very low. many farmers who were earlier sowing pulses have started cultivating sugar. that is also an area of concern. we gave special incentives for pulses. we have tried to set up a different msp for pulses. we have taken steps to procure pulses from farmers with bonus. our focus is on increasing the production of pulses. we are also focusing on building stocks of pulses by importing from abroad. an all out effort is being made and i believe that nobody doubts the sincerity of this governmentarnab: mr prime minister what is your view about the controversy around the exit of raghuram rajan as the rbi governor? a lot has been spoken about this. there was commentary that it may effect indias image, perception as a global economy. whats your own view of the controversy around the exit of raghuram rajan?pm modi: when my government was formed in may 2014, you take newspapers from may, june, july 2014 and check television debates during that period. the topic of the television debates would be  will the new govt let raghuram rajan continue? or will the new government oust raghuram rajan? and there was more or less consensus that he was appointed by the previous govt and so modi wont let him complete his tenure and will remove him. you have seen, that he worked his entire tenure. for the time he was appointed by the previous government, he completing his entire term. so all the misconceptions have been dispelled. secondly, according to my 2 year experience in govt, those who are creating controversies, are being unjust to raghuram rajanarnab: why so?pm modi: i will tell you. those who sayi believe raghuram rajans patriotism is no less than any of ours. it will be doing injustice to him if one says that he will serve the country only if he is at a particular post. as much as i know raghuram rajan, whatever post he holds, wherever he is, he is someone who will continue to serve the country. he is someone who loves his country. therefore, its not like the nation wont get raghuram rajans services, raghuram rajan is not that kind of a person. he is a person who loves the country. those who speak such language are doing great injustice to him. my experience with him has been good.i appreciate the work he has done. and my good wishes will always be with himarnab: prime minister modi, theres a question related to this. during your speech at the executive you used seven words begining with letter s sevabhaav (service), santulan (balance), sanyam (restraint), samvaad (dialogue), samanvay (coordination), sakaratmak (positivity) and samvedna (sensitivity). i will ask the question in context with raghuram rajan because you used these words in the speech at national executive meet speech on june 14 in allahabad. you said, our party leaders and party workers should use these qualities in their daily dealings and behaviour. prime minister, in raghuram rajans context, your rajya sabha mp has made many comments. later he made critical remarks against senior bureaucrats. my question is, do you think it is right? when we talk about sanyam (restraint) and santulan (balance), is it correct?pm modi: whether it is someone from my party or not, i believe that such things are inappropriate. the nation wont benefit from such publicity stunts. one should be more responsible while conducting themselves. anyone who believes he is bigger than the system is wrong.arnab: thats a very clear message.pm modi: i have a very clear message. i have no two minds about it.arnab: and mr prime minister, if i may say so, between may 8 and now, you are speaking as straight as you did before you took over as prime minister. i think that answer takes me to the next subject. mr prime minister, the issue is that of black money. in a very interersting way you said, prices should not be looked at from the point of percepetion, equally, mr prime minister it can be said said that an issue like black money should not be looked at in terms of perception, but it is perception forming. there are political debates on this. experts say that the black money economy has shrunk, 10-15% economy has shrunk through land dealings and other things. you have passed the black money bill, you have made taxation more transparent, you have started information sharing with other countries, you have taken steps, but prime minister modi, people still expect that a rs 25 lakh crores will be brought back and put into their bank accounts. how will you address that expectation? the hope that people have taking black money, how will you address it?pm modi: how did the black money issue arise and how did it become such a serious issue? we have to look at the background. it is an established fact in the minds of the common man those who steal money park their money overseas. its a common perception. even if i look at it from the common mans perspective, i also wonder where does this money go? this issue was always stalled in the parliament. when the matter reached the supreme court, the supreme court ordered special investigation team to look into it, even then the previous government stalled it for three years, from 2011-2014. its after this that political parties, the media and the common man started believing that theres something wrong. then the issue of black money became an agenda. even today i can saythat yes, when there is money stashed in foreign accounts, there are some norms of engagement with foreign countries on the issue. but between 2011-2014, these people were given the opportunity to launder money here and therearnab: and you also said on 17 february 2015 on this issue, that the then law minister is only offering lip servicepm modi: the result was that people got several chances to launder money. secondly, after our government was formed, the first decision taken by our cabinet was to form a special investigation team to bring back black money which was pending despite supreme courts 2011 order. this shows our sincerity. from then on, you cant imagine how stringent the laws have been made to bring back black money and whoever comes in its fold will know how strict the law is. thirdly, i attended the g20 summit. never was black money issue discussed in the g20 forum. it was my first g20 summit, for the first time i met the world leaders. and for the first time in the g20 summit, one paragraph was on unaccounted money, on black money and 20 countries said that the world should cooperateblack. the dirty money, black money was also linked to terrorism, an environment of global census was created. we have been signing agreements one after the other with different countries that there will be real time, automatic exchange of information with india. i recently visited switzerland and there was minimal discussion on the issue. but after i returned, a big delegation from switzerland visited india, and they held meeting with the indian government and we discussedfor several years, we believed that switzerland is the place where black money is stashed, that country is holding discussions to come to a consensus on automatic information exchange and if we reach consensus it will be a great achievement. thirdly you mustve seen that mauritius route came up in almost everything. it was said that money goes out of india and returns through the mauritius route. this was discussed. everyone thought that nothing can be done about the mauritius route.but our government held a dialogue with the mauritius government, made changes to the old treaty. and we successfully made a new treaty to block the money which comes through the mauritius route and very soon it will be phased out and completed. all these decisions are taken to fight the black money menace. this is not a one sided fight. secondly, the govt is working in a direction to make sure that black money isnt generated in india and black money doesnt go out of india, you can see the results of all this.arnab: when the opposition raises the rs 15 lakh issue.pm modi: that is something the opposition raises during elections. let them have some issue to talk aboutarnab: mr prime minister, there has been no major financial corruption or scam in your tenure in the last two years. perception is again, what people say is because you keep a very tight control on the reins of government but the question is there are people, who are wilful defaulters, the economic offenders who take a lot of money from the country or commit economic offences in the country, go overseas and use rules and use lawyers, and they dont come back to india. and people are asking now, is the narendra modi govt determined to take these cases of wilful defaulters and economic offenders to their logical conclusion.pm modi: firstly, this question is not in the minds of people. the people of india have confidence that if theres someone who can do this, it is narendra modi and he will do it. citizens of the country have full faith.arnab: does it worry you, that people have misued the law?pm modi: i take this as an opportunity and i will show them what the law is.arnab: mr. modi, there have been several corruption cases about the previous government, which have now come out. there is agustawestland, many defense scams and defense transactions are now being analyzed seriously. the cases which were quoted in the cag reports but were ignored are now coming in the forefront. this question is important because this isnt just about financial corruption but these questions have direct implications on the national security of the country. do you think, when they say that this is a political witch hunt by narendra modi sarkar, do you think all of these cases would have been possible without political patronage?pm modi: there are many things which are not visible. one cant imagine the difficulty i am experiencing in taking out things from dirt. one who is working there knows the amount of dirt that exists and how certain things have been caught in a web. there are certain powers behind it. the case about agusta helicopters. i cant deny it and i believe that we have the right to doubt that people behind this are very experienced. they have perfectly practiced the art of doing wrong deeds. they are very experienced and knowledgeable. and one can also smell the fact that such a thing wouldnt have been done without a shield. now, agencies are probing. lets see how far the probe goes. but the investigation shouldnt go ahead while people are being targeted, neither does my government target anyone. the sin has been committed, but how much is done, how was it done, who did it, probe agencies will find out in a professional way. whatever comes out, will be put outarnab: prime minister, talking about your speech in the us congress, and the humour that you displayed. i felt some of it was impromptu. but the americans were able to relate to what you said, i dont remember the exact words, you said, i am informed that the working of the us congress is harmonious. and then there was a pause and people were laughing. then you said, i am told  you emphasized and said i am told that you are well known for your bipartisanship. then the applause was more. and then you said, you are not alone. time and again i have witnessed a similar spirit in the indian parliament. you spoke about a serious topic in a interesting manner. you referred to the upper house. there was a lot of response on that too. your humour was really appreciated and i think it was a wonderful moment when you were speaking. but, mr. prime minister, when you look back at the parliament, this question comes to many peoples minds, has prime minister narendra modi being held back from achieving his own objectives because of the non-stop parliamentary logjam. how much has this affected his moving towards his own targets? if you critically analyze this situation, do you feel your government could have been more consultative or do you feel the blame is entirely with the opposition?pm modi: i look at it differently. i believe there have been a lot of problems. whether the fault is ours or theirs, i ll leave it to the people. people will decide. but because of discussions in parliament  we may not come to a decision, the decision could be opposing our view, nothing wrong in that. but at least there should be a discussion. the sad part is, if somebody is running away from debate or dont let discussions happen, then it is a cause of worry in a democracy. whether the governments work is accomplished or not, i dont see it as a cause of worry. if not today, it will happen tomorrow. there are certain things which will happen at an administrative level. the big thing is, parliament is for discussion. parliament is to show dissent. parliament is to give an argument for ones opposition, to present an argument when they support.to uphold this basic spirit of parliament, is the responsibility of every person who values democracy. it is the responsibility of those present in the parliament and those outside. it is the responsibility of those in power and those not in power. this is a matter of spirit and it should be followed. as far as the government is concerned, on every issue and at every forum, we have tried to hold discussions. i myself have met the opposition leaders and spoken to them. key members of the government are also in touch. and you must have seen that many issues have been resolved. in the last session, we have passed 12 bills in rajya sabha, we passed 10 bills in the lok sabha. so the pace has picked up. when people say opposition, it is unfair to the opposition. there are some parties in the parliament which are not with the bjp or nda, but are with the government on key decisions. so, to defame the opposition by saying that all opposition parties are against us  when some people do this, it is wrong. there is one party which has problems. and the whole world knows that party. secondly, to say that when you were is opposition, you did it this way there is a difference between every opposition party. we have run the government for 60 years and now we are in the opposition, so we know the nitty-gritties of the government, we know the responsibilities. we cant behave in the way, a new opposition party behaves. a party which hasnt been in power or hasnt seen anything, could behave in this way. for example, we are in power now, and consider in 2040 we become the opposition party. so, in 2040 we cant have the same conduct as the one we had in 2009 or 2010.arnab: congress is a very experienced and old partypm modi: thats why i say that, those who have been in power for so many years, shouldnt be doing this. if there is a new party in the opposition, they have a small demand for their state or if an mp has a demand for his/her constituency and does something like this, then we can understand. ones who have been in power for very long, shouldnt be doing such thingsarnab: prime minister modi, do you think the gst bill which has been stuck for over one and half years, it is a path-breaking economic reform. it unifies the country. recently you met ms jayalalithaa after she was sworn in as the chief minister, mamata banerjee has extended her support for gst and congress allies at the state level are supporting the gst bill. do you feel optimistic that gst bill will be passed in the next session of the parliament?pm modi: first we need to understand, that we look at gst only within the purview of an economic reform because of which the right information doesnt come out. not having gst straight away means loss for the poor of uttar pradesh. absence of gst straight away means loss for the poor people of bihar. not passing the gst would mean loss for the poor people of poor states like bengal, orissa and assam. people who sit in the rajya sabha must understand this. gst is beneficial for the poor people of the states represented by them, because those states will economically benefit the most from gst. the money will be used for the welfare of the poor people of those states. this is why be it mamata banerjee, be it nitish kumar, be it akhilesh yadav or naveen patnaik, all these states want the gst bill to be passed at the earliest. there is just one group which has made it the issue of prestige. now the kind of arithmetic which is working out, i hope that this decision is passed in favour of the poor. you will be surprised to what extent has the opposition reached to the level of distortion. in the previous session we introduced an act. indian government has rs 40,000 crore rupees from the campa fund. rs 40,000 crore. we wanted to give that money to the states. states have to use that money for forestry, for greenery, for planting trees and plants. the bill is meant for that. had this rs 40,000 crore reached the states before the monsoons, it would have been used for the forests. a lot of people would have got employment, people who plant trees would have been employed. there would be plantation and due to the rains the plants would start growing within a year. but just because of obstructionism, states have been deprived of the benefit of rs 40,000 crore. the money was meant for the forests and for the tribals. they blocked it. there was no argument on itarnab: the reasonyou had triedpm modi: made all efforts.arnab: you had invited former prime minister manmohan singh and sonia gandhi here at the race course roadpm modi: we held talks at every levelarnab: still? the word you used ego issue, why has it become an ego issue? and people would want to know why is the prime minister unable to end this?pm modi: the prime minister cannot answer this question. those creating obstructions can only answer this question. but despite this, i will keep trying. i am ready to convince them in which ever way possible. if i have to convoke someone over a cup of tea at their house, i am even ready for that. i have no problem. my only aim is the welfare of the poor of my country and the poor of states like uttar pradesh.arnab: you spoke of uttar pradesh. mr prime minister, elections will be held in uttar pradesh in 6,7,8 months. the focus of entire nation will be on it. you are the mp from varanasi. but some comments are made by bjp, some say sangh parivar, some independent groups, communal colour is added to it and not just from one party but from other parties as well. mr prime minister are you going to be able to keep development as the sole agenda? the main issue in the uttar pradesh polls should be that of development, it shouldnt get capsized, the focus shouldnt be elsewhere. are you confident that communal agenda will not overpower development?pm modi: its my conviction, its my commitment. you must have seen during the 2014 elections that i fought elections on the issue of development. the new generation of the country only believes in development. i believe that solution to all problems is in development. development is also the solution to the tension that people talk about. if we provide employment to people, if we ensure theres food on their plates, if we provide them with facilities and give them education, all the tension will end. and this is why, all those who want good for the nation, i request them to compete towards development and for development. this atmosphere should be created in the country and i think such an environment is being created nowadays.arnab: so the hot heads who make extreme comments, is there a necessity to control them? so that there is no politics in the name of religionpm modi: firstly, i am of the firm belief that the nation should progress on the issue of development. and it is necessary that the country moves forward on the issue of development. i would like to tell the media not to make heroes out of those people who make such comments.arnab: but they keep making such commentspm modi: dont make them heroes, they will stoparnab: we dont make them heroes, we make them villains.pm modi: but why do you make them so big? i see such statements by people on tv, whose faces i havent even seen and they end up becoming spokesmen on tvarnab: self styled spokesmenpm modi: i dont know why such people are encouragedarnab: mr prime minister, lets talk in 2016 of the 2017 elections. after delhi, then bihar, then assam, west bengal. after that we will talk about punjab. before we finish talking about punjab, we will talk about uttar pradesh. then there is the gujarat state election. dont you think that this country is permanently stuck in an electoral cycle? the focus constantly and i want you to reflect on this issue, the focus is on party politics, polarising issues, not on governance. we are a country, if we say, we are constantly in a political campaign mode. is this a good thing? should we break away from it? and what is your view on it?pm modi: see this is not an issue about narendra modi or the prime minister. and also it is not an issue about a particular party or a particular government.but before the last parliament session, the speaker had called all the parties for a meal. after the agenda meeting everyone was sitting to eat. i had also reached at the same time. while talking casually over food, almost people from all parties said that the central and state elections must be held together. everyone said it. after that during the farewell function of the rajya sabha mps, people from different parties were talking with each other. one of the leaders said, modiji do anything but get us out of this cycle of elections.arnab: was that leader from your party?pm modi: no, he was not from my party. so i said that discussion should happen. what is wrong in that? then one day i said that this was being talked about. this issue has also been discussed in a parliamentary committee. this work has also been started by the election commission and i think they have also writen a letter on it. like in the fight against black money, this issue of elections also gets connected to black money. electoral reforms are necessary if the country has to be rid of black money. it is one of the areas for electoral reforms. i believe that the prime minister cannot take a decision on this and nor should he do that. neither the government can do this.there should be a broad discussion on this and we should not run away from the debate on this continious cycle of elections. the indian voter today is very mature. he votes in one fashion in the lok sabha elections, he votes in a different manner in the state assembly elections. we have seen this. in 2014, the general elections conincided with the odisha assembly elections. the same electorate gave one judgement for odisha and another judgement for delhi. so this countrys voter is very mature and we should trust his maturity. there should be a debate on how costs can be reduced by holding simultaneous elections, how the influence of black money can be curbed, how the five years can be spent in taking the country forward. today due to the model code of conduct, there is a loss even in those areas where the code is not applicable.when i was in gujarat, i found that at least 80 to 90 officers were spending two to three months on election duties in other states. this could be happening in every state. so this is an area of concern and some time or the other this question will have to be thought of. i would want the election commission to take this debate forward. they should invite all political parties and hold discussions with everybody and whatever comes out of it.arnab: can there be a timebound resolution in this?pm modi: the election commission will have to invite all political parties to discuss this. the process will get derailed if one party were to initiate this.arnab: are you willing to take the lead in building that consensus?pm modi: despite being the prime minister, i still belong to a political party. the better thing would be for the election commission to initiate this. today the election commission is a very prestigious institution in our country. every political party believes in the election commission and it will further empower this institution and that will be better.arnab: i think it is an interesting idea of simultaneous elections. though state parties, regional parties may feel that it will effect them badly. that the national parties like the bjp will gain.pm modi: odisha is the best example. odisha is the best example. in 2014, the bjp had no advantage in the state but the bjp won on the lok sabha seats. this shows the difference.arnab: mr prime minister how are you keeping your schedule nowadays? i mean you keep a terrifying pace. the number of meetings you hold, people say your officers find it hard to keep up.pm modi: it is not so, it has been 2 years now and everyone is used to the work. i believe that it is such a big country that one must do as much work as possible. so i keep doing that.arnab: before i come to my last question mr prime minister, one issue that i want to come to is the farmers crisis. as you are well aware, there has been a crisis in this country, you referred to it. in that speech to your mps, about which i asked you earlier as well, on 20th may in the central hall of parliament you said that this government is not for myself, this government is for the poor, we must do something for them. the farmers crisis mr prime minster is a reality. i am glad that in this interview you have not avoided the reality, youve faced it, youve talked about it. we have linked our entire future to the monsoons. how do we overcome this from becoming an annual crisis in this country?pm modi: we will have to put stress on water management here. you must have seen that under the pradhan mantri krishi sinchayi yojana, we have put stress on water issues. during these drought days, i met leaders from 11 states separately and sat with them for about 2-3 hours each. the country would have believed that their prime minister is working even if i had held a meeting with 11 of them together for around 10 minutes. but i didnt do that. i sat with leaders from different states separately to understand specific problems and what we could do for water in those states. i am happy, whichever party the state government affiliated to, all the governments focused a lot on water issues this summer.we will reap its benefits this monsoon. using scientific methods for water accumulation and irrigation, collecting water and directing them towards the fields, everyone did that. micro irrigation is stressed upon. even for sugarcane farming, farmers are slowly moving towards micro irrigation which earlier happened through flood irrigation. paddy crops for which large amount of water is used. today, farmers have started using drip irrigation for it. if we do well in water facilities, then one of the problems is solved. after independence, for the first time, we have brought in pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana which can cover maximum number of farmers. the farmer will have to pay only 2%, only 2%, the government will take care of the rest. the farmers will get an assurance. for instance, in maharashtra, the monsoons are expected in the month of june, the farmers have prepared for everything but havent started with the sowing process. now if there are no rains till august, so practically his crops have not been damaged, because he did not sow the seeds.but the pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana even takes this into consideration and benefits the farmer. another important aspect, once the crops are harvested, theyre cut and kept in the field, assuming it has been a good year for crop growth, with 100% crop production, but it hasnt been loaded on trucks and sent to the market yet. and if it rains, even after 15 days of harvesting, if there is loss, it is covered under pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana. second layer of protection, minimum premium with maximum cover. after independence, for the first time, we have brought in pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana. thirdly, first time we have brought in e-mandi concept. farmer in the village, can sell the crops to the best markets in the country through his mobile phone. farmer would set the price at which the crop would be sold. earlier, farmers used to take the produce on carts or tractors, used to go to a mandi 20-25kms away, then due to storage issues, even if they had to sell for rs 10 less than the price, they used to sell it. now, sitting at home the farmer would know what price to sell the crops at. next point is about, food processing, value addition. we opened up 100% foreign direct investment in food processing.for example, if a farmer is selling tomatoes and if a company is processing tomato ketchup then my farmers would benefit from it. the companies that make aerated drinks, coca-cola, pepsi etc, i requested them to add 5% natural fruit juice. in regions near nagpur and vidarbha where oranges are cultivated, coca-cola is going to add 5% of orange juice. if we add 5% natural juice to aerated water, farmers would get their market and their fruits wouldnt go waste. we should have a comprehensive all-out scheme. so much of our land has been damaged. we have brought in soil health card. we have a soil health abhiyan. the farmer will know the fertility of the land through it. whether a fertilizer needs to be used or not, the farmer will understand. on an average, a farmer with 1 hectare of land will be able to save rs 15000-20000. so we have brought in scientific methods. you would know that in our country, farmers used to be lathicharged when they would go to buy urea and they had to buy it in black. we got urea 100% neem coated. earlier, urea used to go to chemical factories, and the government subsidies were stolen in the name of farmers. after neem coating, urea cannot be used for any other purpose except farming.because of neem coating, there is a qualitative change which helps in healing the damaged land. due to neem coating a piece of land that used 10 kgs of urea can now manage with 7 kgs of urea. all these initiatives are in the direction of agriculture and the resuarnab: do you think that the farmers crisis will be resolved, the question i asked, that it wont be an annual affair, the dependence on monsoons will go down?pm modi: see agriculture is a state subject. the indian government has taken initiatives, if the state government are enthusiastic to implement this, which i think they will be. as i told you i met leaders from different states and they worked a lot for water issues. if this works, pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana has direct involvement of the central government, it will have great benefits.arnab: mr prime minister now i have two questions for you.pm modi: this has become too long.arnab: ill club these two (questions) together. youre also enjoying it and i am glad youre speaking mr prime minister because there is so much ground to cover and i think viewers would like to hear your view, sir. actually there are three, if you allow me. theyre short questions. first is that prime minister narendra modi, how much is politics playing on your mind? in the sense that every prime minister, especially someone who is as forthright as you, looks at the next big challenge. is 2019 anywhere in your mind?pm modi: those who have seen me in gujarat, and those who have seen me in the last two years, those who see me without any bias, they will know that i am an apolitical prime minister. apart from elections, i dont get involved into politics ever. you can call elections a necessity, a restraint or a responsibility, we have to do it. i attend many functions, go to different areas, you wouldnt have heard any political comment from me. if i go to a government function, i talk about government related topics. if i attend a railways function i talk about railways, if water then water, if water bodies, then water bodies. my focus is on governance. country has been at greatest loss because governments were run only for elections. governments must not run only for elections. the government should be a bona fide attempt of meeting the demands and expectations of the common people. elections should just be a bi-product. it is a democracy. winning and losing is a part of it. it shouldnt be hyped. you would have seen recently i urged everyone to pay taxes before 30th september. i even said it on mann ki baat yesterday. will a person, who is only concerned with winning elections, say that post 30th september youd face problems?arnab: this was also a warning in a way.pm modi: it is a warning. it is definitely a warning. it is a warning. my first warning is to my government officers to not presume citizens as thieves. i have already given this warning. i have handled my officers first. it took me quite some time. you will be shocked to hear that i have given an early retirement to more than 30 people from income tax department on integrity issues. this isnt a small issue. people who werent transferred since 20 years, i got them transferred. so, one, my focus is on my system. second, i also tell the country, that for the poor of the nation we would have to give out something for the poor in our country. it is my responsibility to give the people an account of every rupee. i will use it at right places. i wont let it get stolen. but if i need to give houses to the poor, we would need revenue. i dont want to increase taxes, i just want taxes to be paid honestly. there is no need to increase the taxes. the country can run without troubling the citizens. i am working towards it. that is why i have given the citizens a chance to pay the taxes till 30th september, whatever it is rs 10,000 or rs. 50,000. if they think they want to come into mainstream, they must and shouldnt be worried. after 30th september, the government will have to take steps. i will not worry about the polls. i will take the necessary steps. i want to work for the poor in my country.arnab: mister prime minister, do some crystal ball gazing for the next three years. for the next three years, to use the cricketing analogy, how do you find your run rate so far and will you have to score at a higher run rate in the next three years to achieve your targets?pm modi: see, no matte at what speed i move forward, i am never satisfied. if today i run at a speed of 100, i keep an aim of running at 200. i think that the world that was behind us, has gone ahead. we need to run a lot to match that level. so we do not need to calculate. we just need to give it all in. and i have given myself in completely. ive been successful is pulling my entire government in. i believe that the country is also committed to move forwardarnab: final question to you mr prime minister, what motivates you the most? first of all as i said, will you be able to keep this pace? what motivates you the most and also if you can share with our viewers honestly what is your one greatest source of worry?pm modi: firstly, i dont live under the burden of worries. problems and challenges are there, you cant deny that. but you must challenge the challenges and not let the challenges turn into worries. this is my principle. i challenge the challenges. i like to face the problems. i dont run away from them. whatever loss i have to face for it, i face it. but i cant leave the country helpless. this responsibility must be taken and i will continue to do so. for all good and bad things, it is my responsibility. i do not regret anything. i believe, people of the country have given me the responsibility and i must fulfill it. thirdly, when i see the poor in our country, it reminds me of the work that i have to do for them. day before yesterday, i was in pune, and met a shrimaan chandrakant ji. a retired teacher with a pension of rs 16000, donates rs 5000 every month for swachh abhiyaan. if a 70 year old retired teacher with children and family at home, without worrying about them, worries about the country, then being the prime minister, i should work a thousand times more than chandrakant ji. this is my inspiration. people of this country who work day and night, they are my inspiration. i look at them and i work even harder.arnab: prime minister narendra modi it has been a privilege. i am grateful for this interview.pm modi: thank youarnab: and thank you on behalf of all our viewers that you spoke frankly. the program is frankly speaking and i am thankful to you that you were so frank.pm modi: i just request you to not create controversies out of this but instead use it for the benefit of the country.arnab: please do not think like that. thank you very muchpm modi: thanks a lot. thank you very much.arnab: thank you very much.for all the latest india news,

(Source: Express Photo by Pramod Adhikari) Former president of JNU Kanhaiya Kumar participate in a programme of AISF at Ravindralaya Auditorium in Lucknow on Sunday. (Source: Express Photo by Pramod Adhikari)Raising the slogan of Jai Bhim-Lal Salaam, former JNU Students Union president Kanhaiya Kumar on Sunday pitched for a rainbow coalition of Ambedkarites and Communists and vowed to apprise people of the Centres anti-people policies in his first speech in poll-bound UP since the sedition case in February.At a programme organised by the All India Students Federation in Lucknows Ravindralaya auditorium, Kumar said there was a fight going on between the followers of Bhimrao Ambedkar and RSS icon M S Golwalkar, adding that Ambedkars followers would emerge victorious.Launching a tirade against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Centre and the RSS, Kanhaiya said they were trying to convert the nation into a Hindu Rashtra and ignoring the poor. Nobody would have thought that the PM will one day become a model to sell the SIM card of a particular company, he added.Modiji, you are not the nation, Sangh is not the Parliament and the Manu Smriti is not the Constitution. We speak against you, Sangh and the Manu Smriti. We believe in the Constitution and Ambedkar. We believe in the nation of Ambedkar, Kanhaiya said, adding that a 65-year-old could not become the leader of a young nation like India and most people do not believe in his personality-centric politics.Referring to the lynching of Mohammed Akhlaq in Dadri over suspicion that he had stored beef, Kumar said that when India is filled with diversity, numerous languages and varied food habits, how can one ask the whole country to eat a particular thing. He said that Modis is the only government which says it will complete its policies in 2022 and not 2019 when its term gets over.Kanhaiya said the government had failed to deliver on many of its promise. He had promised to give employment to 2 crore people in a year, but could not provide anything. We will go to people with these anti-people actions. Be it the police, sedition, or hurling of shoes and tomatoes, nothing will be able to stop us, he added, demanding unemployment allowance for those who are not provided employment.Kanhaiya said the idea that election of a Dalit or a woman chief minister will lead to development of these sections or that an OBC leaders government will lead to the progress of backward castes is also wrong.He said that people need to form a rainbow coalition based on the ideas of thinkers like Ambedkar, Karl Marx, Lenin and Mao Zedong to create a Samatamulak Samaj.Watch what else is making newsCPI leader Dr Girish said that Kanhaiyas second address, slated for Monday in Faizabad, is yet to get required permissions by the district administration. He added that Kumar will address audiences across the state in the coming days and though this is not part of the election campaign, it was a way of enlightening people about the current political situation.Left parties, which have no significant presence in the state, are likely to contest about 200 assembly seats jointly.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App","former president of jnu kanhaiya kumar participate in a programme of aisf at ravindralaya auditorium in lucknow on sunday.

His sales have, however, dropped over the past month since buyers are low on cash. Now, the saplings too are currently threatened for want of farm hands.Read | Demonetisation will hit farmers, informal workers; long-term outlook positiveOur business involves lot of cash rotation. The complications are mounting with every passing day. I have never seen such an uncertain scenario in the past 50 years since I took over my family business and started producing saplings, says Khokh, 70.His problem is he has money, but cant access it. The day Modi made his announcement, Khokh had Rs2.8 lakh in high-value currency which he deposited in a bank. Since then, he has been struggling to withdraw cash for payment to the labourers.He is in a labour intensive business and needs to pay anywhere between 20 and 60 workers daily. These days, I am cash strapped, and there are other expenses to buy fertiliser, pesticides, diesel and equipment which I am unable to do, Khokh laments.Khokhs inconveniences spell bigger trouble for farmers who buy seeds and saplings from him. Coming amid the sowing season for rabi crop, the scarcity of cash is estimated to have delayed sowing in at least one-third of Punjabs 35 lakh hectares of crop land. Khokh says the sowing for vegetables scheduled to start in January could also be in jeopardy.The demonetisation has adversely impacted agricultural activities, admits GS Kalkat, chairman of Punjabs state farmers commission.Khokh could not have agreed more. He is currently preparing saplings of chilly over five acres which should be sufficient to grow the spicy ingredient over 900 acres. He needs money for that purpose but the squeeze in liquidity has put him in a tight spot.He recently sold 1,500 quintals of potato seeds, one-third of which was on credit since farmers did not have the cash to buy. I am sure farmers who come to buy chilly seeds will seek credit again. My business will be finished, Khokh says.Khokh is at one end of the agricultural chain. Sukhwinder Singh of Bhattian in Ludhiana is at the other by being a farmer who usually buys seeds from him.A farmer who plans to grow potato over 10 acres needs a cash investment of around Rs3 lakh. Costs include saplings, festiliser and pesticides. Most of the purchases are in cash, something we hardly have these days, points out Singh.The problem facing Jagdev Singh of Muteon is pressing. He had some cash savings which he spent on his daughters wedding recently. Now no one would give me saplings on credit. Banks are of little help. I do not know how to sow crop this season, he says.Farmers  both growing seeds and crops  are predicting a slump in vegetable produce this coming season. Growing crops will be a challenge. Selling them will be no less a problem. Traders have already lowered the buying price citing cash crunch and farmers will be forced to sell in distress. Traders loss is also farmers loss, Khokh explains.This is Part 5 of our ongoing series on the effect of demonetisation on rural India.

Some vendors picked up tomatoes for free, while cattle feasted on the remaining dump.Apparently, he has come all the way to Hyderabad, because tomato prices came down drastically in Anantapur market, Srinivas, a local commission agent, told the media.The situation is similar in other parts of Rayalaseema that are known for production of tomatoes.Read | My business will be finished: Cash crunch hits farmers in PunjabUttar PradeshThe state government has approached several potato-deficit states, offering them to lift surplus potato from the state at an affordable rate in a bid to help its farmers get a better price.The government move comes amidst prevailing low prices of potato that have added to the plight of farmers. The state government has written to potato-deficit states like Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, telling them they can procure potato from UP, horticulture director SP Joshi said.Joshi also blamed farmers, saying they erred in anticipating the price. Potato was selling for Rs 1,500 per quintal till July-August but most farmers chose to sit on the stock, guessing the price will go up further.
