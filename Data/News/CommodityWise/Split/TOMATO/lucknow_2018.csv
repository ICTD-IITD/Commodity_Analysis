Photo: Indranil Bhoumik/MintNew Delhi: Production of horticulture crops like vegetables and fruits is likely to touch a record 305.4 million tonnes (mt) in 2017-18, about 1.6% higher than the previous year and 8% higher than the previous five years average, the agriculture ministry said in its first advance estimates released on Tuesday.The final estimates for 2016-17 released alongside showed that production of these perishable crops was 300.6 mt, a year-on-year rise of over 5%.Within horticulture, production of vegetables is estimated at 181 mt in 2017-18, about 1% higher than the year before, while that of fruits is estimated at 95 mt, 2% higher than the previous year.Data showed that during the year, area under different perishable crops stood at 24.9 million hectares, about 0.3% higher than the year before. Between 2015-16 and 2017-18, productivity of horticulture crops rose from 11.7 tonnes per hectare to an estimated 12.3 tonnes per hectare.Disaggregated data on estimates of production of specific crops showed onions at 21.4 mt, about 4.5% lower than the year before, and potatoes at 49.3 mt, marginally higher than the 48.6 mt in 2016-17. Production of tomatoes is estimated to rise 7.7% year-on-year in 2017-18 to 22.3 mt, showed the data.The record production during 2017-18 will mark the sixth straight year of horticulture production outstripping that of foodgrains (estimated at 276mt in 2016-17), suggesting a structural change in Indian agriculture where farmers are increasingly growing perishable commercial crops due to a growing market and a quicker cash flow as these crops require less time from sowing to marketing.However, price volatility continues to be a major risk in horticulture, with prices of onions, tomatoes and potatoes plunging below growing costs several times last year. While farmers in Madhya Pradesh were forced to sell onions as low as Rs2 per kg in June last year, in northern India, farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were forced to dump their potato crop for want of buyers around the same time.Retail and wholesale prices of perishables are also at a large variance from each other, implying fragmented markets and poor cold chain facilities. For instance, while tomatoes are currently selling for as low as Rs2-4 per kg in wholesale markets in Andhra Pradesh, they are retailing at Rs35 per kg in Delhi.","within horticulture, production of vegetables is estimated at 181 mt in 2017-18, about 1% higher than the year before, while that of fruits is estimated at 95 mt, 2% higher than the previous year. photo: indranil bhoumik/mintnew delhi: production of horticulture crops like vegetables and fruits is likely to touch a record 305.4 million tonnes (mt) in 2017-18, about 1.6% higher than the previous year and 8% higher than the previous five years average, the agriculture ministry said in its first advance estimates released on tuesday.the final estimates for 2016-17 released alongside showed that production of these perishable crops was 300.6 mt, a year-on-year rise of over 5%.within horticulture, production of vegetables is estimated at 181 mt in 2017-18, about 1% higher than the year before, while that of fruits is estimated at 95 mt, 2% higher than the previous year.data showed that during the year, area under different perishable crops stood at 24.9 million hectares, about 0.3% higher than the year before. between 2015-16 and 2017-18, productivity of horticulture crops rose from 11.7 tonnes per hectare to an estimated 12.3 tonnes per hectare.disaggregated data on estimates of production of specific crops showed onions at 21.4 mt, about 4.5% lower than the year before, and potatoes at 49.3 mt, marginally higher than the 48.6 mt in 2016-17. production of tomatoes is estimated to rise 7.7% year-on-year in 2017-18 to 22.3 mt, showed the data.the record production during 2017-18 will mark the sixth straight year of horticulture production outstripping that of foodgrains (estimated at 276mt in 2016-17), suggesting a structural change in indian agriculture where farmers are increasingly growing perishable commercial crops due to a growing market and a quicker cash flow as these crops require less time from sowing to marketing.however, price volatility continues to be a major risk in horticulture, with prices of onions, tomatoes and potatoes plunging below growing costs several times last year. while farmers in madhya pradesh were forced to sell onions as low as rs2 per kg in june last year, in northern india, farmers from punjab, haryana and uttar pradesh were forced to dump their potato crop for want of buyers around the same time.retail and wholesale prices of perishables are also at a large variance from each other, implying fragmented markets and poor cold chain facilities. for instance, while tomatoes are currently selling for as low as rs2-4 per kg in wholesale markets in andhra pradesh, they are retailing at rs35 per kg in delhi."

5aeb23c49855b7179ad719fd,From Plate to Plough: Left behind on the farm,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/indian-farmers-agricultural-reforms-pm-narendra-modi-bjp-5007918/,2018-01-02,,Indian Express,"Of the 99 major and medium irrigation projects identified for completion by 2019 through the LTIF, not more than 10 have been completed so far. Of the 99 major and medium irrigation projects identified for completion by 2019 through the LTIF, not more than 10 have been completed so far.The year 2017 has been a great one for the BJP, politically. Under the leadership of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, the party has scaled new heights by wresting Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Manipur, retaining Goa and Gujarat, and luring Bihar into its fold. The only minor setback was Punjab, where the Akalis and BJP lost. The party now rules in 19 states, either on its own or as a dominant partner of the NDA. More than two-thirds of Indians live in these states and this is, perhaps, the best opportunity for the Modi government to carry out agriculture reforms in a synchronised manner, at least in these 19 states. Remember, agriculture is a state subject in the Constitution, and this sector has remained somewhat neglected in the reform process since 1991. This is PM Modis moment. If he can reform agriculture, he can not only distinguish the NDAs policies from UPA-type reforms, but also establish himself as a leader of the masses. This will pay handsome dividends in 2019.It is not a secret any more that farmers have suffered during the last three-and-a-half years of the Modi government, first from two successive droughts and then from tumbling agri-prices. In the first four years of the Modi government, agri-GDP is going to register an average annual growth rate of around 2 per cent, which is almost half of what was achieved during the 10 years of UPA rule. So, without lifting its performance, and the incomes of farmers, it will not be feasible to achieve either sabka sath, sabka vikas or doubling farmers incomes by 2022, as has been promised by the prime minister.As one looks back at 2017 with an agri-lens, one finds it a puzzling and painful year for farmers. The monsoon was reasonably good, and so was kharif production. Still, several states saw farmers agitations triggered primarily by very low prices for their produce, be it onions, potatoes, pulses, oilseeds or cotton. The profitability of major kharif crops for major producing states, based on market prices and projected costs estimated by the CACP, has gone down dramatically to less than 5 per cent or negative in kharif 2017 (see graph). This has to be measured against the promise of 50 per cent profit over costs, as mentioned in the BJPs 2014 poll manifesto.The worst, however, happened in Madhya Pradesh, where the farmers agitation became violent and many farmers died in the ensuing police firing. This led to a knee-jerk reaction in policies, from farm loan waivers in many states to a drastic increase in import duties on pulses and edible oils.Earlier, the Union budget for 2017-18 had also announced several measures for farmers. For example, the augmentation of the Long Term Irrigation Fund (LTIF) with NABARD by Rs 20,000 crore taking its total to Rs 40,000 crore; the micro-irrigation fund of Rs 5,000 crore, and the dairy development fund of Rs 8,000 crore, all with NABARD. A model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2017, was also circulated later. But what has been the progress so far? Very little. Of the 99 major and medium irrigation projects identified for completion by 2019 through the LTIF, not more than 10 have been completed so far and that too many without field channels. The micro-irrigation fund has not taken off yet, and the dairy fund was approved just a few days ago. No wonder, with such a lacklustre performance, one cannot expect much improvement in agriculture or farmers incomes.Now, under duress, MP is undergoing a pilot price deficiency payment scheme under which the difference between MSP and modal prices of eight notified commodities is to be paid directly to farmers. The jury is still out on the projects performance but at this stage it is clear that it suppressed market prices further, especially of urad, creating a crisis for urad farmers.In case of trade policy, the government seems to have finally woken up to dovetail it with MSP policy and, accordingly, raised import duties significantly on pulses and edible oils ensuring that the landed prices of these are not below their respective MSPs. Better late than never!What can be done now as one treads into 2018?First, expedite the implementation of major flagship programmes by removing glitches, especially in crop insurance (PMFBY), irrigation (LTIF and micro-irrigation), and the dairy development fund. Second, ensure an effective monitoring and dovetailing of agri-trade and tariff policy with MSP policy through a sub-committee of the Cabinet to take quick decisions. Third, give high priority to agri-marketing reforms to create a seamless movement of agri-produce all over India. Dont hesitate to admit, and correct, the fact that so far e-NAM has not delivered and will not do so unless the basics of agri-marketing from assaying, grading, storage, to dispute settlement are put on track. A major impetus needs to be given to link farmer producer organisations (FPOs) to agri-markets through Operation Veggies TOP (tomatoes, onions and potatoes) on the lines of Operation Flood in milk, linking FPOs to processors and organised retailers, bypassing the mandi system. NABARD has more than 2,000 FPOs and SFAC has created about 700 FPOs. A beginning can be made with them. With experience, this model can be scaled up to other fruit and vegetables.If the Modi government can do this, it can certainly improve farmers economic condition, who in turn will also reward the BJP in 2019.

The Prime Minister likes to boast that it is much easier to do business in India now than it ever was.Indian farmers voted overwhelmingly for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2014 general election that swept him to power. He cannot count on them doing so again, as a crash in commodity prices and surging fuel costs stoke anger in the countryside.Four years ago, Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept Uttar Pradesh, Indias most populous state, winning 73 of 80 seats, as the rural poor  swayed by promises of higher crop prices  deserted the rival Congress party.Now, facing criticism for not improving living standards in the countryside, where 70 percent of Indias 1.3 billion people live, analysts and farm economists said Modi would find it hard to repeat the feat in a general election due by May 2019.While it is risky to predict election outcomes in India, where religion and caste remain important issues  not to mention the influence of fickle regional parties  interviews with some of the states millions of farmers suggest rural angst could cost the government dearly.No doubt, there was a wave for Modi in 2014, but farmers are disenchanted with him now, said sugar cane grower Uday Vir Singh, 53, plonking down on a wicker chair and smoking his hookah. Modi promised to double farmers income but our earning has halved because of his apathy and anti-farmer policies. Nearly half a dozen farmers sitting with Singh on a hand-woven rope cot, and many of others in Kairana  which elected a joint opposition candidate from a small regional party in a key by-election this week  accused Modi and the Uttar Pradesh administration, also run by the BJP, of failing to live up to their promises and overlooking the concerns of villagers.Modi is a very good salesman but we are not going to fall prey to his glib talk again, said 55-year-old Narendra Kalhande, who grows cane on his 2.5 acre farm. Farm Minister Radha Mohan Singh defended the governments record, citing initiatives on irrigation, crop insurance and electronic trading platforms for farmers to sell produce.For farmers, Prime Minister Modis 48 months have been much better than the Congresss rule of 48 years, Singh told Reuters, referring to the main opposition party that dominated Indian politics for most of the years since independence from British colonial rule in 1947.CRISIS IN COUNTRYSIDEHigher inflation and sluggish growth helped Modi trounce Congress, which had long counted the rural poor as its core constituency, in the 2014 election. Small farmers had been hit by rising living costs but benefited little from rising food prices because of the web of middlemen in Indias agricultural markets.Since then the economy has picked up, recording its quickest pace of expansion in nearly two years in the first three months of 2018, helped by higher growth in the farm sector. But lower food prices, weaker farm wages and modest crop procurement rates  the result of a shift in focus from the subsidies favoured by Congress to investment under the pro-business BJP  have hurt most of Indias 263 million farmers, who typically own less than 2 hectares of land.In the past year, Modis popularity has fallen by 12 percentage points among farmers, according to a Mood of the Nation survey published last week by the Lokniti, part of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), a research institute.Next years election would be fought on farmers issues, said Yogendra Yadav, a leading academic-turned-politician. Farmer organisations in some states began a 10-strike on Friday, in which they have said they will stop selling produce to protest a steep drop in the prices of an array of farm goods.Farm Minister Singh said his government had yet to hear from farm leaders but was ready to listen.COMMODITIES CRASHPrices of pulses, a key crop for Indian farmers, have fallen 25-30 percent below state-set support prices, as higher imports and bumper local crops bumped up supplies. While the government announces support prices for more than 20 crops each year to set a benchmark, state agencies actually buy only rice and wheat at the support level.Vegetable prices, especially onions, cabbage and tomatoes have fallen 25 percent from last year, largely because of the lack of refrigerated trucks that could take the perishables to the consuming big cities. Milk prices have also dived by more than 25 percent in the past year as a global glut has brought exports to a near halt.Farmers in Charkhi Dadri, three hours drive west of the capital New Delhi, recently dumped tomatoes onto the road in protest after buyers offered a quarter of a rupee per kilogram for a crop that costs at least 6 rupees ($0.09) a kg to produce.Jai Bhagwan, 54, borrowed 12,000 rupees to grow onions on a plot of about half acre in Jhajjar, an area otherwise famed for pottery. When his crop was ready, Jai Bhagwan could get only 1,200 rupees.I could not even recover my labour cost, said Jai Bhagwan, who was in New Delhi recently to participate in a farmers meet. Prakash Singh, also from Jhajjar, spent 6,000 rupees to grow green chilli, but the crop fetched him barely 200 rupees.Im in debt up to my eyeballs. But I cant sit idle, so Ill have to borrow more to grow something else, Singh said.Ashok Gulati, a farm economist who advised Indias last government, said there were three policy options to support farmers: building state buffer stocks to soak up excess supply, acting to boost exports or building capacity for processing farm commodities into end products such as milled, dehusked pulses or vegetable oils.Most of those measures would require long-term structural changes, however, and analysts predict in the run-up to the election Modi is likely to announce more populist, short-term fixes such as higher guaranteed prices for crops and farm loan waivers.Many farmers complained they are still reeling from disruptions caused by the launch of a new nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July 2017 and a ban on high denomination bank notes in November 2016. Blaming the shock move for exacerbating farmers financial woes, Gulati said: Expectations were high from the government, but the fact is that the plight of farmers is far worse now than what it was four years ago.Modis drive to purge black money from the economy by removing, at a stroke, 86 percent of the cash in circulation, made it difficult for farmers, who survive on cash, to buy inputs like seeds and receive payments for their crops.In Kairana, all 35 farmers Reuters spoke to agreed that abolishing 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes had made things worse.POWER SURGEFarmers in Uttar Pradesh, home to 220 million people, are also angry over a sharp rise in the pump price of diesel and a steep hike in electricity tariffs. Many farmers in the state use diesel to run tractors for ploughing and trolleys for moving their produce to wholesale markets. They depend on electricity to operate irrigation pumps.Diesel prices have shot up by more than 40 percent to record highs and electricity tariffs have surged by more 20 percent in the past two years, said Shri Pal, a farmer from Shamli.Villages account for most of Indias diesel consumption and thats why higher prices pinch farmers the most, but diesel in India is much more expensive than Bhutan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, said Hannan Mollah, a former lawmaker and a senior official of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).Kairana and Shamli lie in the sugar cane belt of Uttar Pradesh, the top sugar state of India, the worlds biggest producer after Brazil. Soaring global output has caused a collapse in sugar prices, leading to losses for mills who now owe nearly 23 billion rupees to cane growers.A BJP spokesman, G.V.L. Narasimha Rao, said the government has streamlined timely payments to cane growers. That has not been enough to satisfy farmers such as Ram Lakhan Singh, a cane grower from Shamli. Most sugar mills have not paid us a single rupee since December and the government has connived with them to deprive us of our rightful dues. Trust me, cane farmers will think twice before voting for the BJP.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App","the prime minister likes to boast that it is much easier to do business

with him now, said sugar cane grower uday vir singh, 53, plonking down on a wicker chair and smoking his hookah. modi promised to double farmers income but our earning has halved because of his apathy and anti-farmer policies. nearly half a dozen farmers sitting with singh on a hand-woven rope cot, and many of others in kairana  which elected a joint opposition candidate from a small regional party in a key by-election this week  accused modi and the uttar pradesh administration, also run by the bjp, of failing to live up to their promises and overlooking the concerns of villagers.modi is a very good salesman but we are not going to fall prey to his glib talk again, said 55-year-old narendra kalhande, who grows cane on his 2.5 acre farm. farm minister radha mohan singh defended the governments record, citing initiatives on irrigation, crop insurance and electronic trading platforms for farmers to sell produce.for farmers, prime minister modis 48 months have been much better than the congresss rule of 48 years, singh told reuters, referring to the main opposition party that dominated indian politics for most of the years since independence from british colonial rule in 1947.crisis in countrysidehigher inflation and sluggish growth helped modi trounce congress, which had long counted the rural poor as its core constituency, in the 2014 election. small farmers had been hit by rising living costs but benefited little from rising food prices because of the web of middlemen in indias agricultural markets.since then the economy has picked up, recording its quickest pace of expansion in nearly two years in the first three months of 2018, helped by higher growth in the farm sector. but lower food prices, weaker farm wages and modest crop procurement rates  the result of a shift in focus from the subsidies favoured by congress to investment under the pro-business bjp  have hurt most of indias 263 million farmers, who typically own less than 2 hectares of land.in the past year, modis popularity has fallen by 12 percentage points among farmers, according to a mood of the nation survey published last week by the lokniti, part of the centre for the study of developing societies (csds), a research institute.next years election would be fought on farmers issues, said yogendra yadav, a leading academic-turned-politician. farmer organisations in some states began a 10-strike on friday, in which they have said they will stop selling produce to protest a steep drop in the prices of an array of farm goods.farm minister singh said his government had yet to hear from farm leaders but was ready to listen.commodities crashprices of pulses, a key crop for indian farmers, have fallen 25-30 percent below state-set support prices, as higher imports and bumper local crops bumped up supplies. while the government announces support prices for more than 20 crops each year to set a benchmark, state agencies actually buy only rice and wheat at the support level.vegetable prices, especially onions, cabbage and tomatoes have fallen 25 percent from last year, largely because of the lack of refrigerated trucks that could take the perishables to the consuming big cities. milk prices have also dived by more than 25 percent in the past year as a global glut has brought exports to a near halt.farmers in charkhi dadri, three hours drive west of the capital new delhi, recently dumped tomatoes onto the road in protest after buyers offered a quarter of a rupee per kilogram for a crop that costs at least 6 rupees ($0.09) a kg to produce.jai bhagwan, 54, borrowed 12,000 rupees to grow onions on a plot of about half acre in jhajjar, an area otherwise famed for pottery. when his crop was ready, jai bhagwan could get only 1,200 rupees.i could not even recover my labour cost, said jai bhagwan, who was in new delhi recently to participate in a farmers meet. prakash singh, also from jhajjar, spent 6,000 rupees to grow green chilli, but the crop fetched him barely 200 rupees.im in debt up to my eyeballs. but i cant sit idle, so ill have to borrow more to grow something else, singh said.ashok gulati, a farm economist who advised indias last government, said there were three policy options to support farmers: building state buffer stocks to soak up excess supply, acting to boost exports or building capacity for processing farm commodities into end products such as milled, dehusked pulses or vegetable oils.most of those measures would require long-term structural changes, however, and analysts predict in the run-up to the election modi is likely to announce more populist, short-term fixes such as higher guaranteed prices for crops and farm loan waivers.many farmers complained they are still reeling from disruptions caused by the launch of a new nationwide goods and services tax (gst) in july 2017 and a ban on high denomination bank notes in november 2016. blaming the shock move for exacerbating farmers financial woes, gulati said: expectations were high from the government, but the fact is that the plight of farmers is far worse now than what it was four years ago.modis drive to purge black money from the economy by removing, at a stroke, 86 percent of the cash in circulation, made it difficult for farmers, who survive on cash, to buy inputs like seeds and receive payments for their crops.in kairana, all 35 farmers reuters spoke to agreed that abolishing 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes had made things worse.power surgefarmers in uttar pradesh, home to 220 million people, are also angry over a sharp rise in the pump price of diesel and a steep hike in electricity tariffs. many farmers in the state use diesel to run tractors for ploughing and trolleys for moving their produce to wholesale markets. they depend on electricity to operate irrigation pumps.diesel prices have shot up by more than 40 percent to record highs and electricity tariffs have surged by more 20 percent in the past two years, said shri pal, a farmer from shamli.villages account for most of indias diesel consumption and thats why higher prices pinch farmers the most, but diesel in india is much more expensive than bhutan, pakistan, bangladesh and sri lanka, said hannan mollah, a former lawmaker and a senior official of the communist party of india (marxist).kairana and shamli lie in the sugar cane belt of uttar pradesh, the top sugar state of india, the worlds biggest producer after brazil. soaring global output has caused a collapse in sugar prices, leading to losses for mills who now owe nearly 23 billion rupees to cane growers.a bjp spokesman, g.v.l. narasimha rao, said the government has streamlined timely payments to cane growers. that has not been enough to satisfy farmers such as ram lakhan singh, a cane grower from shamli. most sugar mills have not paid us a single rupee since december and the government has connived with them to deprive us of our rightful dues. trust me, cane farmers will think twice before voting for the bjp.for all the latest india news, download indian express app"
5b1860c29855b744d639b21e,Farmers are not getting a fair price,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-are-not-getting-a-fair-price/article24070354.ece,2018-06-03,,The Hindu,"Why the drop in rates?Garlic has been the latest casualty of the price crash in the vegetable market after poor returns of tomato and potato crops forced many farmers to abandon their produce owing to a bumper output in recent days. The miseries of financially distressed farmers seem far from over even as they continue to demand waiver of farm loans and remunerative prices for their produce through several platforms across the country.The problem of plenty has hit the farmers badly. While garlic farmers in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, which produce 45% of the countrys garlic, recently fetched as low as Rs. 1 a kg in wholesale prices, the instances of tomato farmers dumping their harvest on the fields earlier this month  be it in Haryana, Tamil Nadu or Uttar Pradesh after prices nosedived  have only highlighted their woes. Tomato production during 2017-18, according to the first advance estimate, is likely to be 7.8% higher than that of the previous year. However, it is 20% higher than the average production of the past five years. Similarly, potato production is estimated to be 1.5% higher than that of the previous year. However, compared with the average production of the past five years, it is 8.7% higher. These figures indicate that farmers are producing more without good returns. Why are vegetable farmers not getting a fair price? Season after season, farmers face price uncertainties mainly owing to fluctuations in demand and supply caused by bumper or poor production, speculation and hoarding by traders.Are traders manipulating prices?In Madhya Pradesh, after garlic prices dropped sharply, the government decided to include it in the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (Price Deficit Payment Scheme) that was introduced in the Kharif 2017 season. Farmers, however, rue that with the conditions associated with the scheme, most of them are unable to gain any benefit. The scheme is aimed at providing price deficit payments to farmers if the market prices are below the minimum support price. Farmer leaders believe the implementation of this scheme in the first season has resulted in little benefit to farmers, with very little to prevent manipulation of prices by traders. The government claims to have disbursed Rs. 1,900 crore in compensation, but a large section of farmers has been excluded from the scheme, says Jai Kisan Andolan national convener Avik Saha. Those left out bore the brunt of a larger price crash because of market manipulation.What is the way forward?The fluctuation in vegetable prices has become a perennial problem and is usually associated with the economics of demand and supply. Farmers, mainly marginal and small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. Being perishable, vegetables are more prone to price fluctuation, hence they require better infrastructure for storage and marketing. Contract farming is an alternative for farmers to reduce financial risks by providing an assured market for their produce at a pre-agreed price. The Centre last week approved the State/UT Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2018. The Act lays stress on protecting the interests of farmers, considering them as weaker of the two parties entering into a contract. The Act is aimed at ensuring the purchase of the entire pre-agreed quantity of one or more of produce, livestock or its product. Although varied forms of contract farming exist in some pockets, a formal system is not widespread. By and large, cultivation of commercial crops such as cotton, sugarcane, tobacco, tea, coffee, rubber and dairy has had some elements of informal contract farming.Experts believe that integration of vegetable and fruit growers with agro-processing units through contract farming could prove beneficial to producers as it takes care of price fluctuations and helps to mitigate production risk.

Three months on, they have some reason to cheer. Wholesale potato prices now range from Rs 9 to Rs 22 a kilogram and are not expected to slide anytime soon. As demand rises, market experts feel prices will rise further, by up to 60%.One reason is that the quantity of potatoes in cold storage is currently 20% less than last year. Officials said that potatoes are currently commanding higher prices than onions and tomatoes. The wholesale price of onions currently ranges between Rs 3.50 and Rs 9 per kilogram, while tomatoes are selling for between Rs 6 and Rs 9 a kilogram.Potato prices have been rising for a fortnight and market officials believe they will climb further. We are seeing wide fluctuations in the wholesale market. Any tightening of supply will raise prices further, says Deepak Patel , secretary of the Ahmedabad Agricultural Produce Market Committee.Market officials met traders who said prices will not rise if demand remains at the same level, Patel said.Ashish Guru, president of the Gujarat Cold Storage Association , says, There are at least one crore 50-kg bags fewer at cold storages in Gujarat compared to 2017. Further, Uttar Pradesh, a major potato producing state, has registered a fall in production. Farmers have not been getting remunerative prices for their produce and have hence moved away potato to more lucrative crops.Guru said the Gujarat government last year gave Rs 40 as subsidy to potato farmers. Only 4.09 crore 50-kg bags have been stored this year. The number was 5.10 crore bags in 2017. Cold storage capacity in the state is 5.75 crore bags.Guru said the drop in potato production this year has brought some relief to farmers at the cost of higher prices for consumers.According to potato traders, farmers in major potato producing states collectively reduced the acreage sown with the tuber last year by 5% to 7%, after two straight years of gluts in the market. The reduced acreage has led to a 10% to 20% fall in potato output.","ahmedabad: this february, farmers in the state were forced to sell potatoes they had put in cold storage for just rs 1 a kg. three months on, they have some reason to cheer. wholesale potato prices now range from rs 9 to rs 22 a kilogram and are not expected to slide anytime soon. as demand rises, market experts feel prices will rise further, by up to 60%.one reason is that the quantity of potatoes in cold storage is currently 20% less than last year. officials said that potatoes are currently commanding higher prices than onions and tomatoes. the wholesale price of onions currently ranges between rs 3.50 and rs 9 per kilogram, while tomatoes are selling for between rs 6 and rs 9 a kilogram.potato prices have been rising for a fortnight and market officials believe they will climb further. we are seeing wide fluctuations in the wholesale market. any tightening of supply will raise prices further, says deepak patel , secretary of the ahmedabad agricultural produce market committee.market officials met traders who said prices will not rise if demand remains at the same level, patel said.ashish guru, president of the gujarat cold storage association , says, there are at least one crore 50-kg bags fewer at cold storages in gujarat compared to 2017. further, uttar pradesh, a major potato producing state, has registered a fall in production. farmers have not been getting remunerative prices for their produce and have hence moved away potato to more lucrative crops.guru said the gujarat government last year gave rs 40 as subsidy to potato farmers. only 4.09 crore 50-kg bags have been stored this year. the number was 5.10 crore bags in 2017. cold storage capacity in the state is 5.75 crore bags.guru said the drop in potato production this year has brought some relief to farmers at the cost of higher prices for consumers.according to potato traders, farmers in major potato producing states collectively reduced the acreage sown with the tuber last year by 5% to 7%, after two straight years of gluts in the market. the reduced acreage has led to a 10% to 20% fall in potato output."

The current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops.Sugarcane farmers in Uttar Pradesh are owed over Rs 8,300 crore for the crop they have supplied to mills this crushing season at the state governments advised price (SAP). Maharashtras cane growers had similar unpaid dues of Rs 2,213 crore as on March 31, that too, against the Centres lower mandated fair and remunerative price (FRP). Yet, cane area in Maharashtra for the coming 2018-19 season from October is nearly 19 per cent up, while there are reports of UP farmers, too, planting more, undeterred by mounting payment arrears. One reason for this could be sugarcanes hardiness and ability to withstand hail, frost, fire, water, nilgai and wild boar, making it practically a default crop in areas where there is assured irrigation. The fact that its green top leaves can meet the fodder requirements of animals during the crushing period from October to April further adds to the attractiveness.But the current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops. We are, indeed, witnessing a disturbing trend now of farmers going back to planting not just cane, but also paddy and wheat. These are safe crops, where there is reasonable guarantee of receiving minimum support price (MSP) through government procurement. Sugarcane farmers, likewise, know that mills will eventually be forced to pay the FRP/SAP, though the monies may come with a few months delay. Theres no such certainty of return or even yields vis--vis other crops. Bt cotton has lost its bite, with the existing hybrids becoming increasingly susceptible to white-fly and pink bollworm attacks. Oilseeds and pulses have been trading below MSPs over the last 2-3 harvesting seasons. Farmers arent making money even in vegetable cultivation: Tomatoes in Kolar (Karnataka), onions in Lasalgaon (Maharashtra) and potatoes in Agra (UP) are currently selling or were just sold at Rs 6-7 per kg.Given these realities, it is not difficult to see why farmers are seeking a flight to safety  from chana to wheat in Madhya Pradesh, tur, soyabean and ginger to sugarcane in Marathwada, cotton and maize to paddy in Punjab. This is more akin to distress migration rather than a response to any profit signals. The policy prescription to address it is simple: The Centre and state governments should desist from hiking MSPs/FRPs/SAPs of paddy, wheat and sugarcane, which will further incentivise the cultivation of these relatively water-intensive crops. Instead, farmers should be ensured of getting MSPs and reasonable returns at least in oilseeds, pulses, tomatoes, onions and potatoes, whether through physical procurement or price deficiency payment transfers directly into their bank accounts.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App","the current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops. the current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops.sugarcane farmers in uttar pradesh are owed over rs 8,300 crore for the crop they have supplied to mills this crushing season at the state governments advised price (sap). maharashtras cane growers had similar unpaid dues of rs 2,213 crore as on march 31, that too, against the centres lower mandated fair and remunerative price (frp). yet, cane area in maharashtra for the coming 2018-19 season from october is nearly 19 per cent up, while there are reports of up farmers, too, planting more, undeterred by mounting payment arrears. one reason for this could be sugarcanes hardiness and ability to withstand hail, frost, fire, water, nilgai and wild boar, making it practically a default crop in areas where there is assured irrigation. the fact that its green top leaves can meet the fodder requirements of animals during the crushing period from october to april further adds to the attractiveness.but the current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops. we are, indeed, witnessing a disturbing trend now of farmers going back to planting not just cane, but also paddy and wheat. these are safe crops, where there is reasonable guarantee of receiving minimum support price (msp) through government procurement. sugarcane farmers, likewise, know that mills will eventually be forced to pay the frp/sap, though the monies may come with a few months delay. theres no such certainty of return or even yields vis--vis other crops. bt cotton has lost its bite, with the existing hybrids becoming increasingly susceptible to white-fly and pink bollworm attacks. oilseeds and pulses have been trading below msps over the last 2-3 harvesting seasons. farmers arent making money even in vegetable cultivation: tomatoes in kolar (karnataka), onions in lasalgaon (maharashtra) and potatoes in agra (up) are currently selling or were just sold at rs 6-7 per kg.given these realities, it is not difficult to see why farmers are seeking a flight to safety  from chana to wheat in madhya pradesh, tur, soyabean and ginger to sugarcane in marathwada, cotton and maize to paddy in punjab. this is more akin to distress migration rather than a response to any profit signals. the policy prescription to address it is simple: the centre and state governments should desist from hiking msps/frps/saps of paddy, wheat and sugarcane, which will further incentivise the cultivation of these relatively water-intensive crops. instead, farmers should be ensured of getting msps and reasonable returns at least in oilseeds, pulses, tomatoes, onions and potatoes, whether through physical procurement or price deficiency payment transfers directly into their bank accounts.for all the latest opinion news, download indian express app"

We have an archival recipe record of nearly 400-500 dishes, which we have served in our restaurant in the last 75 years, says Akash K Kalra, Managing Director, The United Group. Of these, around 150-200 dishes are on the menu all the time. We keep going back to these, bringing it back to our customers, adapting it to suit their palate and new trends, adds Kalra.Despite this emphasis on food, when United Coffee House started, food was not its focal point. It was more of a place to meet and chat  an adda of sorts. As Kalra says, For many, this was a place to walk in on Sundays after listening to the military nand play and watching the fountains at Central Park for a cup of coffee with snacks.Making the right brewEstablished in 1942, it was the brain child of Lala Hans Raj Kalra (Akash Kalras grandfather), the son of a liquor baron who had a flourishing liquor business in Sialkot in Pakistan. The family moved to Delhi and were based in Chandni Chowk.The first foray into hospitality came with the setting up of the Esplanade Restaurant & Bar in 1938-39 to cater to the American GIs who had their barracks at the Red Fort. It proved to be very popular, but since it was meant for the GIs, it wound up with their moving out after the War in the early 40s.Around that time, Hans Raj Kalra heard of an affluent shopping arcade in Lutyens Delhi called Connaught Place, which had been built in the shape of a horse shoe, for luck. What it lacked was a coffee house. He bought the place and opened United Coffee House.In the 40s, the place would be open from 11 am to 8 pm, typically selling street snacks of Old Delhi. Kalra says, Food then was commercial. No one would eat home food outside, so it was only omelette, chana bhatura, tikka...Post-Independence, the hours extended, and by the 60s it became a full-fledged restaurant. The cuisine initially was a mix of the Old Delhi Kayasth food and Frontier Province Pakistani food.The menu expanded, and during their lifetime, the place had served everything from commercial food, bibiyana (homemade) food, Madras club food, Bombay club food, Calcutta club food, Anglo Indian, khansama-cooked memsahib cuisine, to continental food, Asian, Mexican, Lebanese and, of course, Indian.Conceived in the British era, it still holds a fondness for the Old Raj cuisine, especially British club food  cheese balls, cutlets, samosas, chops.On the menuKalra says, We are known for our keema samosa, cheese balls, tomato fish and chicken a la Kiev. These have not been invented by us, but our variation is a huge hit. There are plenty of other staples  chapli kebabs, Railway mutton curry, dak bungalow chicken curry, chicken Maryland, coq au vin, chicken a la princess.Kalra explains, My grandfather had the acumen to get some of the finest cooks of those times to work for us. With their feedback and my grandfathers insight, a dish would be perfected after many trials. For example, a chef from Lucknow might add raw mango and bay leaf to a dak bungalow chicken curry, which made the taste entirely different from the usual one.To commemorate the 75th year, a new menu was unveiled in May. Classic dishes which had not been on the menu for 20-30 years were revamped.Kalra enthusiastically says, Fuyong, chow chows from Asia, buttermilk burgers were on the list. These dishes are being adjusted to suit todays palate. So if a baked salmon was served with boiled vegetables, today we would be doing it with braised bok choi.What works for UCH is that it still retains the old-world charm of the 1950s  the laid-back era of fine dining, huge chandeliers, unhurried knowledgeable waiters, the attention and care to the patrons with a sense of discreet familiarity.","archiving dishes is a big homework. we have an archival recipe record of nearly 400-500 dishes, which we have served in our restaurant in the last 75 years, says akash k kalra, managing director, the united group. of these, around 150-200 dishes are on the menu all the time. we keep going back to these, bringing it back to our customers, adapting it to suit their palate and new trends, adds kalra.despite this emphasis on food, when united coffee house started, food was not its focal point. it was more of a place to meet and chat  an adda of sorts. as kalra says, for many, this was a place to walk in on sundays after listening to the military nand play and watching the fountains at central park for a cup of coffee with snacks.making the right brewestablished in 1942, it was the brain child of lala hans raj kalra (akash kalras grandfather), the son of a liquor baron who had a flourishing liquor business in sialkot in pakistan. the family moved to delhi and were based in chandni chowk.the first foray into hospitality came with the setting up of the esplanade restaurant & bar in 1938-39 to cater to the american gis who had their barracks at the red fort. it proved to be very popular, but since it was meant for the gis, it wound up with their moving out after the war in the early 40s.around that time, hans raj kalra heard of an affluent shopping arcade in lutyens delhi called connaught place, which had been built in the shape of a horse shoe, for luck. what it lacked was a coffee house. he bought the place and opened united coffee house.in the 40s, the place would be open from 11 am to 8 pm, typically selling street snacks of old delhi. kalra says, food then was commercial. no one would eat home food outside, so it was only omelette, chana bhatura, tikka...post-independence, the hours extended, and by the 60s it became a full-fledged restaurant. the cuisine initially was a mix of the old delhi kayasth food and frontier province pakistani food.the menu expanded, and during their lifetime, the place had served everything from commercial food, bibiyana (homemade) food, madras club food, bombay club food, calcutta club food, anglo indian, khansama-cooked memsahib cuisine, to continental food, asian, mexican, lebanese and, of course, indian.conceived in the british era, it still holds a fondness for the old raj cuisine, especially british club food  cheese balls, cutlets, samosas, chops.on the menukalra says, we are known for our keema samosa, cheese balls, tomato fish and chicken a la kiev. these have not been invented by us, but our variation is a huge hit. there are plenty of other staples  chapli kebabs, railway mutton curry, dak bungalow chicken curry, chicken maryland, coq au vin, chicken a la princess.kalra explains, my grandfather had the acumen to get some of the finest cooks of those times to work for us. with their feedback and my grandfathers insight, a dish would be perfected after many trials. for example, a chef from lucknow might add raw mango and bay leaf to a dak bungalow chicken curry, which made the taste entirely different from the usual one.to commemorate the 75th year, a new menu was unveiled in may. classic dishes which had not been on the menu for 20-30 years were revamped.kalra enthusiastically says, fuyong, chow chows from asia, buttermilk burgers were on the list. these dishes are being adjusted to suit todays palate. so if a baked salmon was served with boiled vegetables, today we would be doing it with braised bok choi.what works for uch is that it still retains the old-world charm of the 1950s  the laid-back era of fine dining, huge chandeliers, unhurried knowledgeable waiters, the attention and care to the patrons with a sense of discreet familiarity."

5b2e78bc9855b72640115dac,Farm crisis real but can be tackled,http://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/farm-crisis-real-can-be-tackled-667754.html,2018-05-02,,Deccan Herald,"One of the oldest civilisations, the Indus Valley civilisation, vanished because of persistent drought. This is a stark reminder to policymakers that they will have to tackle persistent drought in parts of the country failing which civilisation could disappear in a couple of centuries. Farm crisis in India is real, particularly in states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which is going to witness yet another drought this year despite good monsoon forecast for the third consecutive year in the rest of the country.This is one side of the coin but Agriculture Secretary S K Pattanayak, a Karnataka cadre IAS officer, argues that all is not bad with Indian agriculture. It has come a long way and this year India is going to have a bumper crop with food grain production touching a record 275 million tonnes, while horticulture, including fruits and vegetables, will produce a record additional 300 million tonnes. Also, the country has had a record bumper harvest of 23.6 million tonnes in pulses, the only source of protein to the vast vegetarian population.But the stark reality is that farming is the livelihood for half of the 1.25 billion people of India. A farmer must get a remunerative price and adequate income. Already next generation of farmers are moving away from farming and this could have a catastrophic effect on who will feed the 125 crore people, which is not a small number. Also, if the Indian economy has to clock a double-digit growth on a sustained basis, the farm sector has to grow by at least 4% annually on a continuous basis, which has not happened so far. This is necessary to ensure poverty is eradicated.For the woes of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu farmers, Pattanayak said they should change their cropping pattern from water-guzzling crops like paddy and sugarcane and switch over to drip irrigation, which will reduce water consumption drastically. It is a crime to cultivate sugarcane in Maharashtra. Sugarcane should be cultivated in flood-prone areas of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and perhaps the Northeast as it could also be flood protected.Punjab should not be cultivating basmati rice. The practice of which has brought down the water table to a dangerous level. Israel, which has a mere 300 mm of average rainfall, did not find water shortage a major problem and its farm yield is one of the highest. India gets bountiful rainfall and perhaps one of the few countries to have monsoon as a season every year.Even in the arid zones of Rajasthan and Karnataka, the average rainfall is around 800 mm, which is more than double that of Israel. All one has to do is harness this through rainwater harvesting so that fresh water does not go unutilised into the sea. The government, therefore, is rightly giving priority to minor irrigation and desilting of all the existing tanks, besides immediately taking up 99 stalled irrigation projects. This has to be done on a war footing.What is needed now is to make agriculture smart, which has not happened so far in India despite the Green Revolution that only ensured there are no more starvation deaths. Farmers income needs to be not only doubled but at least quadrupled from the present level of Rs 20,000 annually. One way could be to provide income support as in the US instead of price support by way of Minimum Support Price (MSP). Because of high MSP for certain crops like food grains, rich farmers grow these crops to take advantage of procurement as only they have a marketable surplus.The top 10% of Indian farmers produce 60-70% of marketable surplus in food grains. The remaining 90% have only 30% of marketable surplus and hence they get very little benefit from the price support system. The resulting depression of prices for poor farmers in the market leads to distress sale of the small quantity they produce.If income support is given instead, market forces will come into play and the farmer can produce any crop that the market demands and not only those that have price support, which leads to excess production and subsequent depression of prices. This will also ensure that crop failures do not hit farmers hard.If farmers income has to rise, the dependence only on agriculture for income has to change and farmers will have to take to animal husbandry, poultry, fisheries, food processing and other agri-related rural industries and so on for augmenting income. This is because farming by its very nature is seasonal and hence there is disguised unemployment even in the best of times.As the Swaminathan Committee has pointed out, market access to poor farmers is a major problem in India. Bumper tomato crop forces a farmer to sell it at Re 1 per kg but in the retail market, it is not available for less than Rs 20. But Re 1 does not cover even the cost of production. A farmer gets Rs 6 per coconut but in the retail market, it is not available for less than Rs 40. Who then gets the benefit? It is neither the farmer nor the consumer but the rich middlemen.So what is the way out? An Amul like cooperative model that brought about the White Revolution has to be replicated for all crops so that farmers get a remunerative price and the food products are marketed better and exported. The wastage of fruit, vegetables and other crops running into thousands of crores can be minimised. This will facilitate setting up of common cold storage for horticulture produce in areas where they are grown.Amul like cooperatives will also ensure crop insurance, better quality seeds, pesticides and other inputs, thereby minimising crop failures and loss of farm income.--(The writer is a senior journalist based in New Delhi)","one of the oldest civilisations, the indus valley civilisation,

5ce5df16e8e3fc56af40fa0a,A tale of two States,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-tale-of-two-states/article25694572.ece,2018-12-08,,The Hindu,"A few farmers sit huddled near a statue of Sardar Patel at Balaguda village in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh pouring out their woes over steaming cups of tea. The statue marks the entry point to the Patidar-dominated village.One of them, Manoj Patidar, who has just returned from the Mandsaur wholesale market, says that the goods and services tax (GST) and rising prices of diesel have made agriculture a loss-making activity. If the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government stays for another five years, we will have to sell our lands, says the tall farmer, his wry smile deepening the lines on his weather-worn face.In another place and State  in Rajasthan  separated by distance as well as priorities, Chhatar Singh Rathore of Tena village in Shergarh tehsil in Jodhpur district has a very different concern.He runs a roadside dhaba on National Highway 114, which connects Jodhpur to Jaisalmer. His main complaint concerns what he believes to be the wilful disregard of Rajput sentiment. Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, who is seeking a second consecutive term in office, he says, has humiliated Rajputs by not backing their opposition to the film Padmaavat , and also marginalising Manvendra Singh, son of former Union Minister Jaswant Singh, who is a Rajput.With not much farming visible in the entire region, caste is the primary marker of social identity, unlike in Madhya Pradesh, where locals display a clear sense of identity as farmers. The contrast between Mandsaur and Shergarh points to the differences between two worlds. While both are rural, one is agrarian and the other is dominated by an array of non-farm activities.On November 30, all eyes were on New Delhi where there was a massive protest by farmers who had gathered from all over the country in the thousands. Opposition leaders such as Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, and CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury spoke. This event came in the wake of another landmark protest held more than a year ago.In the middle of last year, farmers organisations had taken out a rally that touched Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, among other places. The participants also visited Mandsaur, where, a month earlier, five farmers had been killed in police firing. Weighed down by debts, the agitating farmers were demanding loan waivers.As politics heats up in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the Opposition sees farmer anger as having the potential to dent the prospects of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has performed well in most State elections held since it came to power in 2014. The reading is not far off the mark. The BJP scraped through in its stronghold of Gujarat in the 2017 Assembly elections, as a result of urban votes. The Congress, on the other hand, did well in rural Gujarat.However, one was able to get an idea of the situation while travelling through Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan over the last month. In a complex picture, the rural cannot always be conflated with the agrarian.Long list of woesMadhya Pradesh today presents a picture of rural discontent that is cementing an amorphous farmers identity  a sort of occupational consciousness  that the ruling BJP will have to be wary of in the future. But the same does not hold true in Rajasthan, where the rural sector is involved in an array of occupations  from stone mining and animal husbandry to forays into the hospitality sector through highway and city restaurants. There is nothing like a farmers identity across the vast, parched, swathes of Indias largest State by land area.It takes half an hour to reach Pipliya Mandi, the epicentre of last years farm unrest, on the road from Mandsaur to Neemuch town in Madhya Pradesh. Mukesh Patidar, a soyabean farmer in his mid-30s, has come to the mandi (wholesale market) to buy agricultural implements. My village, Chilot Pipliya, which is about 17-18 kilometres from here, saw one farmer become a shaheed (martyr) last year, he says. He adds that soybean farmers are a distressed lot, with a long list of grievances.If the fertilizer DAP (Diammonium Phosphate) cost Rs. 800-900 per 50 kg in 2013-14, it is now priced at Rs. 1,440 for 45 kg, he says. Potash, which was priced at Rs. 450 per 50 kg one-two years ago, now costs Rs. 900 kg, he adds.We use tractors to prepare our fields for the crop. They run on diesel, which has gone up from Rs. 50 a litre to around Rs. 70 a litre, Patidar says. And labour charges have also gone up from Rs. 150-200 to Rs. 300 a day now. Why will they work for less? They are getting grain at Rs. 1-2 a kg.He predicts that the BJP will lose votes in villages around Pipliya Mandi this time. Dilip Patidar, a farm activist who also runs a shop selling various agricultural goods, says the GST has made things difficult for farmers. He says, The GST on pesticide is 28% now. These were taxed at 0-4% earlier. Look at the motor that pumps water to fields. It was taxed at 6% earlier but attracts 12% GST now. The pipe to connect the motor to the fields attracted no tax earlier but attracts 12-18% GST now.All this has made farm inputs dearer. Of the entire area under soyabean cultivation in India, about half is in Madhya Pradesh, the soyabean State of India. The Malwa region, of which Mandsaur is a part, accounts for more than half of M.P.s cultivation of the kharif crop. Fields are prepared by tractor in the summer months. Renting is the norm for small and medium farmers and tractors are rented out for Rs. 700 per hour, up from Rs. 500 because of diesel price hikes. The cost of soyabean seeds, Dilip Patidar says, is Rs. 5,400 per quintal. Labour charges for sowing as well as harvesting have gone up, he adds.Electricity bills too have shot up. While it is possible to run a diesel engine instead of an electric motor to pump water into the fields, with diesel prices going up, it is becoming an expensive proposition now as with diesel becoming more expensive, with costs are Rs. 200 per hour.The soyabean produce is transported to the mandis (wholesale markets) in Pipliya Mandi, Mandsaur and Neemuch. Here again, transportation is more expensive because of the rise in diesel prices. The present minimum support price (MSP) for soyabean is Rs. 3,399 per quintal, but it sells in mandis at Rs. 2,800-3,100 per quintal.In 2013-14, the mandi prices had gone up to Rs. 4,500-5,000 per quintal, says Mukesh Patidar. He blames faulty export-import policies for the fall in prices.Mandi prices keep fluctuating on a demand-and-supply basis, and vary each day. Says a wholesale trader at the Mandsaur Mandi who refuses to be identified, These are like the stock market. It is partly the luck of the farmer and partly his ability to read trends that determine the price he gets for his produce.Look at onions. When prices begin to rise, they import these and the prices fall again, says Dilip Patidar.Indeed, the interests of farmers and consumers are at odds. When the prices of farm produce rise, the commissions of wholesale traders and other intermediaries in the supply chain push up the retail prices of farm produce. When prices fall, food price inflation ceases to be a problem but farmers face losses, rendering agriculture unprofitable as an occupation.For example, at the Ajmer vegetable wholesale market, tomatoes were selling at Rs. 8 a kg. On the previous two days, 1 kg was was selling at Rs. 10 and Rs. 12, respectively. Just 2 km away at the retail market, it was selling at Rs. 20.The dip in farm fortunes is visibly impacting the politics of Madhya Pradesh, a traditional BJP stronghold, with the Congress clawing back in the villages. The troubles of increased documentation, paperwork and bank payments,  seen by many as a part of the formalisation of the sector and cleaning up of the system  have also annoyed farmers.The M.P. government has put in place a subsidy scheme called Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (BBY), under which the government promises to plug the gap between market prices and the minimum support price (MSP). But to avail it, a farmer has to register himself at an authorised office and produce the required documents at the grain and vegetable market when he goes to sell his produce.Says Sunil Solanki, a farmer: Our soyabean crop gets a subsidy of Rs. 500 a quintal. But for this we have to submit a copy of our documents to the mandi merchant, who submits our farmer code numbers to the official market committee and then credits the money to our accounts, a process which takes between 10 and 15 days. The government subsidy under the BBY, he adds, takes two to three months to get credited to a farmers bank account. Unlike farmers elsewhere, farmers in M.P. are not paid in cash as everything is digitised.In other words, say several farmers, they pay in cash for labour, for renting tractors, and to transport the produce, but get paid by bank transfer. The time lag results in a cash crunch. They complain of long queues at markets and banks. Sensing this as an opportunity, Congress leaders have begun to promise cash payments to farmers if voted to power, according to local residents.Economist Utsa Patnaik says that the coming together of farmers across classes  the poor and the rich  was long overdue. She says: There has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. There has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation, and the displaced will be absorbed by industry. The experience of Europe was different. Rather than being absorbed in industry there, the displaced were exported to North America, Australia and South Africa, and they captured the resources there after subduing indigenous people. We dont have that option.She adds: The open trade policies have exposed farmers to the highs and lows of global prices, which they cannot withstand. The meaning of priority sector has also changed under the influence of neoliberal policies, and farmers are unable to access low-interest loans. They have to borrow from private lenders at high interest rates and end up in a debt trap. It is only now that people have begun to notice the farm unrest that was waiting to burst forth.Other sources of incomeFew farmers can be seen at the Ajmer wholesale vegetable market after 11 a.m. They come here at 3 a.m. and leave after selling their produce  in return for cash payments  by 9-10 a.m. The mandi lacks the scale of operations or the frenzied activity of, say, the Surat wholesale market or even Azadpur Mandi in Delhi.The reason is not hard to find. This correspondents journey through Rajasthan, across 2,100 km, covering Jaipur, Tonk, Ajmer, Sawai Madhopur, Nagaur, Pali and Jodhpur districts, showed farm activity present only in the villages close to Tonk.Rasoolpuri village, which has high Gujjar and Meena populations, has farmland where mustard is grown. Here, farmers complain about rising diesel and fertilizer prices and the limited supply of water, which is available only from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. The produce, they say, sells at Rs. 3,200 a quintal, much below the MSP of Rs. 4,200.Farmers at a tea stall just outside the village say they will vote for the Congress as they are fed up of having their concerns brushed aside.But most of rural Rajasthan is a very different world. Villages, even around Jaipur, for miles on end have hardly any farm activity. The better off among villagers have diversified into non-farm activities such as dairy and poultry, while the poor are into animal grazing or work as labourers in construction activities and other sectors.A 40-minute drive on the Jodhpur-Jaisalmer highway leads to the Balesar-Shergarh belt, an arid, sparsely populated area dotted with Rajput-dominated villages. A detour from the highway down a narrow, broken road reveals what substitutes for farming in this region: stone-mining for the construction sector is in full swing on both sides of the road.Meghlasia is a village with Meghwal (Scheduled Caste) and Rajpurohit families. The latter, who describe themselves as gurus of Rajputs, are Brahmins by caste.Stone-mining is a key source of income for the villagers. In addition, they also sow bajra (millet) after the first rains in June-July, but the yield is subject to the vagaries of the monsoon rains.Caste is the markerLike many other Rajputs who have opened restaurants or dhabas because there is not enough water for farming, Chhatar Singh Rathore of the Rajput-dominated Tena village too runs one on the road towards Jodhpur.Says Rathore, Many people in my village run restaurants on the highway. The richer Rajputs also own restaurants in Jodhpur. There are 10 restaurants in the city run by people from my village.He tries to summarise his villages sources of income: Our previous generation saw many people join the Indian Army. You will find many ex-servicemen here. This generation has taken to the restaurant-catering sector in a major way. That apart, many from the village have migrated to Surat to join the cloth industry where they specialise in designing and packing. Some even race horses in Dubai.The Rajput community in the State has gravitated towards the hospitality sector, with heritage hotels and havelis dotting the State. Many are owned by richer Rajput families. They have a traditional feel and visible Rajput markers such as photographs of men in traditional attire holding a sword or rifle. A lot of them try to attract foreign tourists.This non-farm rural world is in sharp contrast to that of M.P., where an occupational identity centred on farming is being forged. In Shergarh tehsil of Jodhpur, caste remains the prominent identity marker, with cultural issues occupying centrestage.Rathore is unhappy with the Rajasthan government for not standing behind Rajputs on the film Padmaavat . He complains that Vasundhara Raje got the entrance to the Raj Mahal Palace in Jaipur sealed to target former royal Diya Kumari, and also humiliated the family of BJP veteran Jaswant Singh.In Tibna village, about 90 km from Jodhpur, water supply poses an acute problem. Sarpanch Bhawani Singh Rathore points to a dry hand pump which is wrapped in a sack cloth. The village has houses placed wide apart, and is populated longitudinally, one house after another for a few kilometres. It has just 300 families, says the sarpanch, of which 150 are Rajput. Other than water, villagers also complain about the lack of school teachers in the local government school. However, despite their various frustrations, they do not think of themselves as aggrieved farmers. Caste remains the key marker of identity and status.You find three types of scenarios, says political analyst and author Sajjan Kumar. The first is Madhya Pradesh, where agriculture is linked to the market, with cash crops such as soyabean and cotton. Here, farming is under stress because of a fall in market prices and the impact of demonetisation. The second is seen in agrarian States such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (excluding western U.P.). Their agriculture is not linked to the market, with mainly food crops such as rice and wheat being produced. An arid State such as Rajasthan presents a third scenario, where agriculture is not central to rural life.He explains the significance of these diverse realities: An occupational identity, where people identify as farmers, is emerging in States of the first kind, such as M.P., Maharashtra and Gujarat. In States such as U.P. and Bihar, while agriculture is central to rural life, caste and religion remain dominant identity markers in the absence of strong market linkages of agriculture. In Rajasthan, in the near absence of agriculture as a key rural vocation, identity markers are still tied to caste.Rathores sentiments lend credence to this hypothesis. I have no problem with [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi. He says we should sell pakodas if we can and I have been doing so at my restaurant, he says. My problem is with Vasundhara Raje. Rajputs will try to ensure a victory for Manvendra Singh at Jhalrapatan. What is a Rajput without self-respect?There has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. There has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation.Utsa Patnaik,Economist","a few farmers sit huddled near a statue of sardar patel at balaguda village in mandsaur, madhya pradesh pouring out their woes over steaming cups of tea. the statue marks the entry point to the patidar-dominated village.one of them, manoj patidar, who has just returned from the mandsaur wholesale market, says that the goods and services tax (gst) and rising prices of diesel have made agriculture a loss-making activity. if the shivraj singh chouhan government stays for another five years, we will have to sell our lands, says the tall farmer, his wry smile deepening the lines on his weather-worn face.in another place and state  in rajasthan  separated by distance as well as priorities, chhatar singh rathore of tena village in shergarh tehsil in jodhpur district has a very different concern.he runs a roadside dhaba on national highway 114, which connects jodhpur to jaisalmer. his main complaint concerns what he believes to be the wilful disregard of rajput sentiment. rajasthan chief minister vasundhara raje, who is seeking a second consecutive term in office, he says, has humiliated rajputs by not backing their opposition to the film padmaavat , and also marginalising manvendra singh, son of former union minister jaswant singh, who is a rajput.with not much farming visible in the entire region, caste is the primary marker of social identity, unlike in madhya pradesh, where locals display a clear sense of identity as farmers. the contrast between mandsaur and shergarh points to the differences between two worlds. while both are rural, one is agrarian and the other is dominated by an array of non-farm activities.on november 30, all eyes were on new delhi where there was a massive protest by farmers who had gathered from all over the country in the thousands. opposition leaders such as congress president rahul gandhi, delhi chief minister arvind kejriwal, and cpi(m) general secretary sitaram yechury spoke. this event came in the wake of another landmark protest held more than a year ago.in the middle of last year, farmers organisations had taken out a rally that touched madhya pradesh, maharashtra, gujarat and rajasthan, among other places. the participants also visited mandsaur, where, a month earlier, five farmers had been killed in police firing. weighed down by debts, the agitating farmers were demanding loan waivers.as politics heats up in the run-up to the 2019 lok sabha election, the opposition sees farmer anger as having the potential to dent the prospects of the ruling bharatiya janata party (bjp), which has performed well in most state elections held since it came to power in 2014. the reading is not far off the mark. the bjp scraped through in its stronghold of gujarat in the 2017 assembly elections, as a result of urban votes. the congress, on the other hand, did well in rural gujarat.however, one was able to get an idea of the situation while travelling through madhya pradesh and rajasthan over the last month. in a complex picture, the rural cannot always be conflated with the agrarian.long list of woesmadhya pradesh today presents a picture of rural discontent that is cementing an amorphous farmers identity  a sort of occupational consciousness  that the ruling bjp will have to be wary of in the future. but the same does not hold true in rajasthan, where the rural sector is involved in an array of occupations  from stone mining and animal husbandry to forays into the hospitality sector through highway and city restaurants. there is nothing like a farmers identity across the vast, parched, swathes of indias largest state by land area.it takes half an hour to reach pipliya mandi, the epicentre of last years farm unrest, on the road from mandsaur to neemuch town in madhya pradesh. mukesh patidar, a soyabean farmer in his mid-30s, has come to the mandi (wholesale market) to buy agricultural implements. my village, chilot pipliya, which is about 17-18 kilometres from here, saw one farmer become a shaheed (martyr) last year, he says. he adds that soybean farmers are a distressed lot, with a long list of grievances.if the fertilizer dap (diammonium phosphate) cost rs. 800-900 per 50 kg in 2013-14, it is now priced at rs. 1,440 for 45 kg, he says. potash, which was priced at rs. 450 per 50 kg one-two years ago, now costs rs. 900 kg, he adds.we use tractors to prepare our fields for the crop. they run on diesel, which has gone up from rs. 50 a litre to around rs. 70 a litre, patidar says. and labour charges have also gone up from rs. 150-200 to rs. 300 a day now. why will they work for less? they are getting grain at rs. 1-2 a kg.he predicts that the bjp will lose votes in villages around pipliya mandi this time. dilip patidar, a farm activist who also runs a shop selling various agricultural goods, says the gst has made things difficult for farmers. he says, the gst on pesticide is 28% now. these were taxed at 0-4% earlier. look at the motor that pumps water to fields. it was taxed at 6% earlier but attracts 12% gst now. the pipe to connect the motor to the fields attracted no tax earlier but attracts 12-18% gst now.all this has made farm inputs dearer. of the entire area under soyabean cultivation in india, about half is in madhya pradesh, the soyabean state of india. the malwa region, of which mandsaur is a part, accounts for more than half of m.p.s cultivation of the kharif crop. fields are prepared by tractor in the summer months. renting is the norm for small and medium farmers and tractors are rented out for rs. 700 per hour, up from rs. 500 because of diesel price hikes. the cost of soyabean seeds, dilip patidar says, is rs. 5,400 per quintal. labour charges for sowing as well as harvesting have gone up, he adds.electricity bills too have shot up. while it is possible to run a diesel engine instead of an electric motor to pump water into the fields, with diesel prices going up, it is becoming an expensive proposition now as with diesel becoming more expensive, with costs are rs. 200 per hour.the soyabean produce is transported to the mandis (wholesale markets) in pipliya mandi, mandsaur and neemuch. here again, transportation is more expensive because of the rise in diesel prices. the present minimum support price (msp) for soyabean is rs. 3,399 per quintal, but it sells in mandis at rs. 2,800-3,100 per quintal.in 2013-14, the mandi prices had gone up to rs. 4,500-5,000 per quintal, says mukesh patidar. he blames faulty export-import policies for the fall in prices.mandi prices keep fluctuating on a demand-and-supply basis, and vary each day. says a wholesale trader at the mandsaur mandi who refuses

Of the 99 major and medium irrigation projects identified for completion by 2019 through the LTIF, not more than 10 have been completed so far.The year 2017 has been a great one for the BJP, politically. Under the leadership of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, the party has scaled new heights by wresting Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Manipur, retaining Goa and Gujarat, and luring Bihar into its fold. The only minor setback was Punjab, where the Akalis and BJP lost. The party now rules in 19 states, either on its own or as a dominant partner of the NDA. More than two-thirds of Indians live in these states and this is, perhaps, the best opportunity for the Modi government to carry out agriculture reforms in a synchronised manner, at least in these 19 states. Remember, agriculture is a state subject in the Constitution, and this sector has remained somewhat neglected in the reform process since 1991. This is PM Modis moment. If he can reform agriculture, he can not only distinguish the NDAs policies from UPA-type reforms, but also establish himself as a leader of the masses. This will pay handsome dividends in 2019.It is not a secret any more that farmers have suffered during the last three-and-a-half years of the Modi government, first from two successive droughts and then from tumbling agri-prices. In the first four years of the Modi government, agri-GDP is going to register an average annual growth rate of around 2 per cent, which is almost half of what was achieved during the 10 years of UPA rule. So, without lifting its performance, and the incomes of farmers, it will not be feasible to achieve either sabka sath, sabka vikas or doubling farmers incomes by 2022, as has been promised by the prime minister.As one looks back at 2017 with an agri-lens, one finds it a puzzling and painful year for farmers. The monsoon was reasonably good, and so was kharif production. Still, several states saw farmers agitations triggered primarily by very low prices for their produce, be it onions, potatoes, pulses, oilseeds or cotton. The profitability of major kharif crops for major producing states, based on market prices and projected costs estimated by the CACP, has gone down dramatically to less than 5 per cent or negative in kharif 2017 (see graph). This has to be measured against the promise of 50 per cent profit over costs, as mentioned in the BJPs 2014 poll manifesto.The worst, however, happened in Madhya Pradesh, where the farmers agitation became violent and many farmers died in the ensuing police firing. This led to a knee-jerk reaction in policies, from farm loan waivers in many states to a drastic increase in import duties on pulses and edible oils.Earlier, the Union budget for 2017-18 had also announced several measures for farmers. For example, the augmentation of the Long Term Irrigation Fund (LTIF) with NABARD by Rs 20,000 crore taking its total to Rs 40,000 crore; the micro-irrigation fund of Rs 5,000 crore, and the dairy development fund of Rs 8,000 crore, all with NABARD. A model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2017, was also circulated later. But what has been the progress so far? Very little. Of the 99 major and medium irrigation projects identified for completion by 2019 through the LTIF, not more than 10 have been completed so far and that too many without field channels. The micro-irrigation fund has not taken off yet, and the dairy fund was approved just a few days ago. No wonder, with such a lacklustre performance, one cannot expect much improvement in agriculture or farmers incomes.Now, under duress, MP is undergoing a pilot price deficiency payment scheme under which the difference between MSP and modal prices of eight notified commodities is to be paid directly to farmers. The jury is still out on the projects performance but at this stage it is clear that it suppressed market prices further, especially of urad, creating a crisis for urad farmers.In case of trade policy, the government seems to have finally woken up to dovetail it with MSP policy and, accordingly, raised import duties significantly on pulses and edible oils ensuring that the landed prices of these are not below their respective MSPs. Better late than never!What can be done now as one treads into 2018?First, expedite the implementation of major flagship programmes by removing glitches, especially in crop insurance (PMFBY), irrigation (LTIF and micro-irrigation), and the dairy development fund. Second, ensure an effective monitoring and dovetailing of agri-trade and tariff policy with MSP policy through a sub-committee of the Cabinet to take quick decisions. Third, give high priority to agri-marketing reforms to create a seamless movement of agri-produce all over India. Dont hesitate to admit, and correct, the fact that so far e-NAM has not delivered and will not do so unless the basics of agri-marketing from assaying, grading, storage, to dispute settlement are put on track. A major impetus needs to be given to link farmer producer organisations (FPOs) to agri-markets through Operation Veggies TOP (tomatoes, onions and potatoes) on the lines of Operation Flood in milk, linking FPOs to processors and organised retailers, bypassing the mandi system. NABARD has more than 2,000 FPOs and SFAC has created about 700 FPOs. A beginning can be made with them. With experience, this model can be scaled up to other fruit and vegetables.If the Modi government can do this, it can certainly improve farmers economic condition, who in turn will also reward the BJP in 2019.

Of the 125 lakh tonnes of wheat procured in the state during the current season so far, 65 lakh tonnes are being stored in the open.In technical terms, it is called covered at plinths (CAP) storage, which is a great cause of concern for the state government. The wheat stored in open is exposed to the vagaries of weather, and has shorter life. But what makes it worse are the piling up stocks of grains.There are 25 lakh tonnes of wheat of the previous season and officials in the Food Corporation of India (FCI), the central body that runs nationwide public distribution system, say the state will have a backlog of wheat of one full season (at least 125 lakh tonnes), hinting at tougher days ahead for the states food and civil supplies department.Besides, some more wheat of the current season is expected to arrive in the mandis.

The Prime Minister likes to boast that it is much easier to do business in India now than it ever was.Indian farmers voted overwhelmingly for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2014 general election that swept him to power. He cannot count on them doing so again, as a crash in commodity prices and surging fuel costs stoke anger in the countryside.Four years ago, Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept Uttar Pradesh, Indias most populous state, winning 73 of 80 seats, as the rural poor  swayed by promises of higher crop prices  deserted the rival Congress party.Now, facing criticism for not improving living standards in the countryside, where 70 percent of Indias 1.3 billion people live, analysts and farm economists said Modi would find it hard to repeat the feat in a general election due by May 2019.While it is risky to predict election outcomes in India, where religion and caste remain important issues  not to mention the influence of fickle regional parties  interviews with some of the states millions of farmers suggest rural angst could cost the government dearly.No doubt, there was a wave for Modi in 2014, but farmers are disenchanted with him now, said sugar cane grower Uday Vir Singh, 53, plonking down on a wicker chair and smoking his hookah. Modi promised to double farmers income but our earning has halved because of his apathy and anti-farmer policies. Nearly half a dozen farmers sitting with Singh on a hand-woven rope cot, and many of others in Kairana  which elected a joint opposition candidate from a small regional party in a key by-election this week  accused Modi and the Uttar Pradesh administration, also run by the BJP, of failing to live up to their promises and overlooking the concerns of villagers.Modi is a very good salesman but we are not going to fall prey to his glib talk again, said 55-year-old Narendra Kalhande, who grows cane on his 2.5 acre farm. Farm Minister Radha Mohan Singh defended the governments record, citing initiatives on irrigation, crop insurance and electronic trading platforms for farmers to sell produce.For farmers, Prime Minister Modis 48 months have been much better than the Congresss rule of 48 years, Singh told Reuters, referring to the main opposition party that dominated Indian politics for most of the years since independence from British colonial rule in 1947.CRISIS IN COUNTRYSIDEHigher inflation and sluggish growth helped Modi trounce Congress, which had long counted the rural poor as its core constituency, in the 2014 election. Small farmers had been hit by rising living costs but benefited little from rising food prices because of the web of middlemen in Indias agricultural markets.Since then the economy has picked up, recording its quickest pace of expansion in nearly two years in the first three months of 2018, helped by higher growth in the farm sector. But lower food prices, weaker farm wages and modest crop procurement rates  the result of a shift in focus from the subsidies favoured by Congress to investment under the pro-business BJP  have hurt most of Indias 263 million farmers, who typically own less than 2 hectares of land.In the past year, Modis popularity has fallen by 12 percentage points among farmers, according to a Mood of the Nation survey published last week by the Lokniti, part of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), a research institute.Next years election would be fought on farmers issues, said Yogendra Yadav, a leading academic-turned-politician. Farmer organisations in some states began a 10-strike on Friday, in which they have said they will stop selling produce to protest a steep drop in the prices of an array of farm goods.Farm Minister Singh said his government had yet to hear from farm leaders but was ready to listen.COMMODITIES CRASHPrices of pulses, a key crop for Indian farmers, have fallen 25-30 percent below state-set support prices, as higher imports and bumper local crops bumped up supplies. While the government announces support prices for more than 20 crops each year to set a benchmark, state agencies actually buy only rice and wheat at the support level.Vegetable prices, especially onions, cabbage and tomatoes have fallen 25 percent from last year, largely because of the lack of refrigerated trucks that could take the perishables to the consuming big cities. Milk prices have also dived by more than 25 percent in the past year as a global glut has brought exports to a near halt.Farmers in Charkhi Dadri, three hours drive west of the capital New Delhi, recently dumped tomatoes onto the road in protest after buyers offered a quarter of a rupee per kilogram for a crop that costs at least 6 rupees ($0.09) a kg to produce.Jai Bhagwan, 54, borrowed 12,000 rupees to grow onions on a plot of about half acre in Jhajjar, an area otherwise famed for pottery. When his crop was ready, Jai Bhagwan could get only 1,200 rupees.I could not even recover my labour cost, said Jai Bhagwan, who was in New Delhi recently to participate in a farmers meet. Prakash Singh, also from Jhajjar, spent 6,000 rupees to grow green chilli, but the crop fetched him barely 200 rupees.Im in debt up to my eyeballs. But I cant sit idle, so Ill have to borrow more to grow something else, Singh said.Ashok Gulati, a farm economist who advised Indias last government, said there were three policy options to support farmers: building state buffer stocks to soak up excess supply, acting to boost exports or building capacity for processing farm commodities into end products such as milled, dehusked pulses or vegetable oils.Most of those measures would require long-term structural changes, however, and analysts predict in the run-up to the election Modi is likely to announce more populist, short-term fixes such as higher guaranteed prices for crops and farm loan waivers.Many farmers complained they are still reeling from disruptions caused by the launch of a new nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July 2017 and a ban on high denomination bank notes in November 2016. Blaming the shock move for exacerbating farmers financial woes, Gulati said: Expectations were high from the government, but the fact is that the plight of farmers is far worse now than what it was four years ago.Modis drive to purge black money from the economy by removing, at a stroke, 86 percent of the cash in circulation, made it difficult for farmers, who survive on cash, to buy inputs like seeds and receive payments for their crops.In Kairana, all 35 farmers Reuters spoke to agreed that abolishing 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes had made things worse.POWER SURGEFarmers in Uttar Pradesh, home to 220 million people, are also angry over a sharp rise in the pump price of diesel and a steep hike in electricity tariffs. Many farmers in the state use diesel to run tractors for ploughing and trolleys for moving their produce to wholesale markets. They depend on electricity to operate irrigation pumps.Diesel prices have shot up by more than 40 percent to record highs and electricity tariffs have surged by more 20 percent in the past two years, said Shri Pal, a farmer from Shamli.Villages account for most of Indias diesel consumption and thats why higher prices pinch farmers the most, but diesel in India is much more expensive than Bhutan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, said Hannan Mollah, a former lawmaker and a senior official of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).Kairana and Shamli lie in the sugar cane belt of Uttar Pradesh, the top sugar state of India, the worlds biggest producer after Brazil. Soaring global output has caused a collapse in sugar prices, leading to losses for mills who now owe nearly 23 billion rupees to cane growers.A BJP spokesman, G.V.L. Narasimha Rao, said the government has streamlined timely payments to cane growers. That has not been enough to satisfy farmers such as Ram Lakhan Singh, a cane grower from Shamli. Most sugar mills have not paid us a single rupee since December and the government has connived with them to deprive us of our rightful dues. Trust me, cane farmers will think twice before voting for the BJP.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App","the prime minister likes to boast that it is much easier to do business

launch of a new nationwide goods and services tax (gst) in july 2017 and a ban on high denomination bank notes in november 2016. blaming the shock move for exacerbating farmers financial woes, gulati said: expectations were high from the government, but the fact is that the plight of farmers is far worse now than what it was four years ago.modis drive to purge black money from the economy by removing, at a stroke, 86 percent of the cash in circulation, made it difficult for farmers, who survive on cash, to buy inputs like seeds and receive payments for their crops.in kairana, all 35 farmers reuters spoke to agreed that abolishing 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes had made things worse.power surgefarmers in uttar pradesh, home to 220 million people, are also angry over a sharp rise in the pump price of diesel and a steep hike in electricity tariffs. many farmers in the state use diesel to run tractors for ploughing and trolleys for moving their produce to wholesale markets. they depend on electricity to operate irrigation pumps.diesel prices have shot up by more than 40 percent to record highs and electricity tariffs have surged by more 20 percent in the past two years, said shri pal, a farmer from shamli.villages account for most of indias diesel consumption and thats why higher prices pinch farmers the most, but diesel in india is much more expensive than bhutan, pakistan, bangladesh and sri lanka, said hannan mollah, a former lawmaker and a senior official of the communist party of india (marxist).kairana and shamli lie in the sugar cane belt of uttar pradesh, the top sugar state of india, the worlds biggest producer after brazil. soaring global output has caused a collapse in sugar prices, leading to losses for mills who now owe nearly 23 billion rupees to cane growers.a bjp spokesman, g.v.l. narasimha rao, said the government has streamlined timely payments to cane growers. that has not been enough to satisfy farmers such as ram lakhan singh, a cane grower from shamli. most sugar mills have not paid us a single rupee since december and the government has connived with them to deprive us of our rightful dues. trust me, cane farmers will think twice before voting for the bjp.for all the latest india news, download indian express app"
5b1860c29855b744d639b21e,Farmers are not getting a fair price,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-are-not-getting-a-fair-price/article24070354.ece,2018-06-03,,The Hindu,"Why the drop in rates?Garlic has been the latest casualty of the price crash in the vegetable market after poor returns of tomato and potato crops forced many farmers to abandon their produce owing to a bumper output in recent days. The miseries of financially distressed farmers seem far from over even as they continue to demand waiver of farm loans and remunerative prices for their produce through several platforms across the country.The problem of plenty has hit the farmers badly. While garlic farmers in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, which produce 45% of the countrys garlic, recently fetched as low as Rs. 1 a kg in wholesale prices, the instances of tomato farmers dumping their harvest on the fields earlier this month  be it in Haryana, Tamil Nadu or Uttar Pradesh after prices nosedived  have only highlighted their woes. Tomato production during 2017-18, according to the first advance estimate, is likely to be 7.8% higher than that of the previous year. However, it is 20% higher than the average production of the past five years. Similarly, potato production is estimated to be 1.5% higher than that of the previous year. However, compared with the average production of the past five years, it is 8.7% higher. These figures indicate that farmers are producing more without good returns. Why are vegetable farmers not getting a fair price? Season after season, farmers face price uncertainties mainly owing to fluctuations in demand and supply caused by bumper or poor production, speculation and hoarding by traders.Are traders manipulating prices?In Madhya Pradesh, after garlic prices dropped sharply, the government decided to include it in the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (Price Deficit Payment Scheme) that was introduced in the Kharif 2017 season. Farmers, however, rue that with the conditions associated with the scheme, most of them are unable to gain any benefit. The scheme is aimed at providing price deficit payments to farmers if the market prices are below the minimum support price. Farmer leaders believe the implementation of this scheme in the first season has resulted in little benefit to farmers, with very little to prevent manipulation of prices by traders. The government claims to have disbursed Rs. 1,900 crore in compensation, but a large section of farmers has been excluded from the scheme, says Jai Kisan Andolan national convener Avik Saha. Those left out bore the brunt of a larger price crash because of market manipulation.What is the way forward?The fluctuation in vegetable prices has become a perennial problem and is usually associated with the economics of demand and supply. Farmers, mainly marginal and small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. Being perishable, vegetables are more prone to price fluctuation, hence they require better infrastructure for storage and marketing. Contract farming is an alternative for farmers to reduce financial risks by providing an assured market for their produce at a pre-agreed price. The Centre last week approved the State/UT Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2018. The Act lays stress on protecting the interests of farmers, considering them as weaker of the two parties entering into a contract. The Act is aimed at ensuring the purchase of the entire pre-agreed quantity of one or more of produce, livestock or its product. Although varied forms of contract farming exist in some pockets, a formal system is not widespread. By and large, cultivation of commercial crops such as cotton, sugarcane, tobacco, tea, coffee, rubber and dairy has had some elements of informal contract farming.Experts believe that integration of vegetable and fruit growers with agro-processing units through contract farming could prove beneficial to producers as it takes care of price fluctuations and helps to mitigate production risk.

Three months on, they have some reason to cheer. Wholesale potato prices now range from Rs 9 to Rs 22 a kilogram and are not expected to slide anytime soon. As demand rises, market experts feel prices will rise further, by up to 60%.One reason is that the quantity of potatoes in cold storage is currently 20% less than last year. Officials said that potatoes are currently commanding higher prices than onions and tomatoes. The wholesale price of onions currently ranges between Rs 3.50 and Rs 9 per kilogram, while tomatoes are selling for between Rs 6 and Rs 9 a kilogram.Potato prices have been rising for a fortnight and market officials believe they will climb further. We are seeing wide fluctuations in the wholesale market. Any tightening of supply will raise prices further, says Deepak Patel , secretary of the Ahmedabad Agricultural Produce Market Committee.Market officials met traders who said prices will not rise if demand remains at the same level, Patel said.Ashish Guru, president of the Gujarat Cold Storage Association , says, There are at least one crore 50-kg bags fewer at cold storages in Gujarat compared to 2017. Further, Uttar Pradesh, a major potato producing state, has registered a fall in production. Farmers have not been getting remunerative prices for their produce and have hence moved away potato to more lucrative crops.Guru said the Gujarat government last year gave Rs 40 as subsidy to potato farmers. Only 4.09 crore 50-kg bags have been stored this year. The number was 5.10 crore bags in 2017. Cold storage capacity in the state is 5.75 crore bags.Guru said the drop in potato production this year has brought some relief to farmers at the cost of higher prices for consumers.According to potato traders, farmers in major potato producing states collectively reduced the acreage sown with the tuber last year by 5% to 7%, after two straight years of gluts in the market. The reduced acreage has led to a 10% to 20% fall in potato output.","ahmedabad: this february, farmers in the state were forced to sell potatoes they had put in cold storage for just rs 1 a kg. three months on, they have some reason to cheer. wholesale potato prices now range from rs 9 to rs 22 a kilogram and are not expected to slide anytime soon. as demand rises, market experts feel prices will rise further, by up to 60%.one reason is that the quantity of potatoes in cold storage is currently 20% less than last year. officials said that potatoes are currently commanding higher prices than onions and tomatoes. the wholesale price of onions currently ranges between rs 3.50 and rs 9 per kilogram, while tomatoes are selling for between rs 6 and rs 9 a kilogram.potato prices have been rising for a fortnight and market officials believe they will climb further. we are seeing wide fluctuations in the wholesale market. any tightening of supply will raise prices further, says deepak patel , secretary of the ahmedabad agricultural produce market committee.market officials met traders who said prices will not rise if demand remains at the same level, patel said.ashish guru, president of the gujarat cold storage association , says, there are at least one crore 50-kg bags fewer at cold storages in gujarat compared to 2017. further, uttar pradesh, a major potato producing state, has registered a fall in production. farmers have not been getting remunerative prices for their produce and have hence moved away potato to more lucrative crops.guru said the gujarat government last year gave rs 40 as subsidy to potato farmers. only 4.09 crore 50-kg bags have been stored this year. the number was 5.10 crore bags in 2017. cold storage capacity in the state is 5.75 crore bags.guru said the drop in potato production this year has brought some relief to farmers at the cost of higher prices for consumers.according to potato traders, farmers in major potato producing states collectively reduced the acreage sown with the tuber last year by 5% to 7%, after two straight years of gluts in the market. the reduced acreage has led to a 10% to 20% fall in potato output."

The current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops.Sugarcane farmers in Uttar Pradesh are owed over Rs 8,300 crore for the crop they have supplied to mills this crushing season at the state governments advised price (SAP). Maharashtras cane growers had similar unpaid dues of Rs 2,213 crore as on March 31, that too, against the Centres lower mandated fair and remunerative price (FRP). Yet, cane area in Maharashtra for the coming 2018-19 season from October is nearly 19 per cent up, while there are reports of UP farmers, too, planting more, undeterred by mounting payment arrears. One reason for this could be sugarcanes hardiness and ability to withstand hail, frost, fire, water, nilgai and wild boar, making it practically a default crop in areas where there is assured irrigation. The fact that its green top leaves can meet the fodder requirements of animals during the crushing period from October to April further adds to the attractiveness.But the current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops. We are, indeed, witnessing a disturbing trend now of farmers going back to planting not just cane, but also paddy and wheat. These are safe crops, where there is reasonable guarantee of receiving minimum support price (MSP) through government procurement. Sugarcane farmers, likewise, know that mills will eventually be forced to pay the FRP/SAP, though the monies may come with a few months delay. Theres no such certainty of return or even yields vis--vis other crops. Bt cotton has lost its bite, with the existing hybrids becoming increasingly susceptible to white-fly and pink bollworm attacks. Oilseeds and pulses have been trading below MSPs over the last 2-3 harvesting seasons. Farmers arent making money even in vegetable cultivation: Tomatoes in Kolar (Karnataka), onions in Lasalgaon (Maharashtra) and potatoes in Agra (UP) are currently selling or were just sold at Rs 6-7 per kg.Given these realities, it is not difficult to see why farmers are seeking a flight to safety  from chana to wheat in Madhya Pradesh, tur, soyabean and ginger to sugarcane in Marathwada, cotton and maize to paddy in Punjab. This is more akin to distress migration rather than a response to any profit signals. The policy prescription to address it is simple: The Centre and state governments should desist from hiking MSPs/FRPs/SAPs of paddy, wheat and sugarcane, which will further incentivise the cultivation of these relatively water-intensive crops. Instead, farmers should be ensured of getting MSPs and reasonable returns at least in oilseeds, pulses, tomatoes, onions and potatoes, whether through physical procurement or price deficiency payment transfers directly into their bank accounts.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App","the current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops. the current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops.sugarcane farmers in uttar pradesh are owed over rs 8,300 crore for the crop they have supplied to mills this crushing season at the state governments advised price (sap). maharashtras cane growers had similar unpaid dues of rs 2,213 crore as on march 31, that too, against the centres lower mandated fair and remunerative price (frp). yet, cane area in maharashtra for the coming 2018-19 season from october is nearly 19 per cent up, while there are reports of up farmers, too, planting more, undeterred by mounting payment arrears. one reason for this could be sugarcanes hardiness and ability to withstand hail, frost, fire, water, nilgai and wild boar, making it practically a default crop in areas where there is assured irrigation. the fact that its green top leaves can meet the fodder requirements of animals during the crushing period from october to april further adds to the attractiveness.but the current rush to grow sugarcane has less to do with its profitability, as much as the falling returns, if not losses, from other crops. we are, indeed, witnessing a disturbing trend now of farmers going back to planting not just cane, but also paddy and wheat. these are safe crops, where there is reasonable guarantee of receiving minimum support price (msp) through government procurement. sugarcane farmers, likewise, know that mills will eventually be forced to pay the frp/sap, though the monies may come with a few months delay. theres no such certainty of return or even yields vis--vis other crops. bt cotton has lost its bite, with the existing hybrids becoming increasingly susceptible to white-fly and pink bollworm attacks. oilseeds and pulses have been trading below msps over the last 2-3 harvesting seasons. farmers arent making money even in vegetable cultivation: tomatoes in kolar (karnataka), onions in lasalgaon (maharashtra) and potatoes in agra (up) are currently selling or were just sold at rs 6-7 per kg.given these realities, it is not difficult to see why farmers are seeking a flight to safety  from chana to wheat in madhya pradesh, tur, soyabean and ginger to sugarcane in marathwada, cotton and maize to paddy in punjab. this is more akin to distress migration rather than a response to any profit signals. the policy prescription to address it is simple: the centre and state governments should desist from hiking msps/frps/saps of paddy, wheat and sugarcane, which will further incentivise the cultivation of these relatively water-intensive crops. instead, farmers should be ensured of getting msps and reasonable returns at least in oilseeds, pulses, tomatoes, onions and potatoes, whether through physical procurement or price deficiency payment transfers directly into their bank accounts.for all the latest opinion news, download indian express app"

We have an archival recipe record of nearly 400-500 dishes, which we have served in our restaurant in the last 75 years, says Akash K Kalra, Managing Director, The United Group. Of these, around 150-200 dishes are on the menu all the time. We keep going back to these, bringing it back to our customers, adapting it to suit their palate and new trends, adds Kalra.Despite this emphasis on food, when United Coffee House started, food was not its focal point. It was more of a place to meet and chat  an adda of sorts. As Kalra says, For many, this was a place to walk in on Sundays after listening to the military nand play and watching the fountains at Central Park for a cup of coffee with snacks.Making the right brewEstablished in 1942, it was the brain child of Lala Hans Raj Kalra (Akash Kalras grandfather), the son of a liquor baron who had a flourishing liquor business in Sialkot in Pakistan. The family moved to Delhi and were based in Chandni Chowk.The first foray into hospitality came with the setting up of the Esplanade Restaurant & Bar in 1938-39 to cater to the American GIs who had their barracks at the Red Fort. It proved to be very popular, but since it was meant for the GIs, it wound up with their moving out after the War in the early 40s.Around that time, Hans Raj Kalra heard of an affluent shopping arcade in Lutyens Delhi called Connaught Place, which had been built in the shape of a horse shoe, for luck. What it lacked was a coffee house. He bought the place and opened United Coffee House.In the 40s, the place would be open from 11 am to 8 pm, typically selling street snacks of Old Delhi. Kalra says, Food then was commercial. No one would eat home food outside, so it was only omelette, chana bhatura, tikka...Post-Independence, the hours extended, and by the 60s it became a full-fledged restaurant. The cuisine initially was a mix of the Old Delhi Kayasth food and Frontier Province Pakistani food.The menu expanded, and during their lifetime, the place had served everything from commercial food, bibiyana (homemade) food, Madras club food, Bombay club food, Calcutta club food, Anglo Indian, khansama-cooked memsahib cuisine, to continental food, Asian, Mexican, Lebanese and, of course, Indian.Conceived in the British era, it still holds a fondness for the Old Raj cuisine, especially British club food  cheese balls, cutlets, samosas, chops.On the menuKalra says, We are known for our keema samosa, cheese balls, tomato fish and chicken a la Kiev. These have not been invented by us, but our variation is a huge hit. There are plenty of other staples  chapli kebabs, Railway mutton curry, dak bungalow chicken curry, chicken Maryland, coq au vin, chicken a la princess.Kalra explains, My grandfather had the acumen to get some of the finest cooks of those times to work for us. With their feedback and my grandfathers insight, a dish would be perfected after many trials. For example, a chef from Lucknow might add raw mango and bay leaf to a dak bungalow chicken curry, which made the taste entirely different from the usual one.To commemorate the 75th year, a new menu was unveiled in May. Classic dishes which had not been on the menu for 20-30 years were revamped.Kalra enthusiastically says, Fuyong, chow chows from Asia, buttermilk burgers were on the list. These dishes are being adjusted to suit todays palate. So if a baked salmon was served with boiled vegetables, today we would be doing it with braised bok choi.What works for UCH is that it still retains the old-world charm of the 1950s  the laid-back era of fine dining, huge chandeliers, unhurried knowledgeable waiters, the attention and care to the patrons with a sense of discreet familiarity.","archiving dishes is a big homework. we have an archival recipe record of nearly 400-500 dishes, which we have served in our restaurant in the last 75 years, says akash k kalra, managing director, the united group. of these, around 150-200 dishes are on the menu all the time. we keep going back to these, bringing it back to our customers, adapting it to suit their palate and new trends, adds kalra.despite this emphasis on food, when united coffee house started, food was not its focal point. it was more of a place to meet and chat  an adda of sorts. as kalra says, for many, this was a place to walk in on sundays after listening to the military nand play and watching the fountains at central park for a cup of coffee with snacks.making the right brewestablished in 1942, it was the brain child of lala hans raj kalra (akash kalras grandfather), the son of a liquor baron who had a flourishing liquor business in sialkot in pakistan. the family moved to delhi and were based in chandni chowk.the first foray into hospitality came with the setting up of the esplanade restaurant & bar in 1938-39 to cater to the american gis who had their barracks at the red fort. it proved to be very popular, but since it was meant for the gis, it wound up with their moving out after the war in the early 40s.around that time, hans raj kalra heard of an affluent shopping arcade in lutyens delhi called connaught place, which had been built in the shape of a horse shoe, for luck. what it lacked was a coffee house. he bought the place and opened united coffee house.in the 40s, the place would be open from 11 am to 8 pm, typically selling street snacks of old delhi. kalra says, food then was commercial. no one would eat home food outside, so it was only omelette, chana bhatura, tikka...post-independence, the hours extended, and by the 60s it became a full-fledged restaurant. the cuisine initially was a mix of the old delhi kayasth food and frontier province pakistani food.the menu expanded, and during their lifetime, the place had served everything from commercial food, bibiyana (homemade) food, madras club food, bombay club food, calcutta club food, anglo indian, khansama-cooked memsahib cuisine, to continental food, asian, mexican, lebanese and, of course, indian.conceived in the british era, it still holds a fondness for the old raj cuisine, especially british club food  cheese balls, cutlets, samosas, chops.on the menukalra says, we are known for our keema samosa, cheese balls, tomato fish and chicken a la kiev. these have not been invented by us, but our variation is a huge hit. there are plenty of other staples  chapli kebabs, railway mutton curry, dak bungalow chicken curry, chicken maryland, coq au vin, chicken a la princess.kalra explains, my grandfather had the acumen to get some of the finest cooks of those times to work for us. with their feedback and my grandfathers insight, a dish would be perfected after many trials. for example, a chef from lucknow might add raw mango and bay leaf to a dak bungalow chicken curry, which made the taste entirely different from the usual one.to commemorate the 75th year, a new menu was unveiled in may. classic dishes which had not been on the menu for 20-30 years were revamped.kalra enthusiastically says, fuyong, chow chows from asia, buttermilk burgers were on the list. these dishes are being adjusted to suit todays palate. so if a baked salmon was served with boiled vegetables, today we would be doing it with braised bok choi.what works for uch is that it still retains the old-world charm of the 1950s  the laid-back era of fine dining, huge chandeliers, unhurried knowledgeable waiters, the attention and care to the patrons with a sense of discreet familiarity."

5b2e78bc9855b72640115dac,Farm crisis real but can be tackled,http://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/farm-crisis-real-can-be-tackled-667754.html,2018-05-02,,Deccan Herald,"One of the oldest civilisations, the Indus Valley civilisation, vanished because of persistent drought. This is a stark reminder to policymakers that they will have to tackle persistent drought in parts of the country failing which civilisation could disappear in a couple of centuries. Farm crisis in India is real, particularly in states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which is going to witness yet another drought this year despite good monsoon forecast for the third consecutive year in the rest of the country.This is one side of the coin but Agriculture Secretary S K Pattanayak, a Karnataka cadre IAS officer, argues that all is not bad with Indian agriculture. It has come a long way and this year India is going to have a bumper crop with food grain production touching a record 275 million tonnes, while horticulture, including fruits and vegetables, will produce a record additional 300 million tonnes. Also, the country has had a record bumper harvest of 23.6 million tonnes in pulses, the only source of protein to the vast vegetarian population.But the stark reality is that farming is the livelihood for half of the 1.25 billion people of India. A farmer must get a remunerative price and adequate income. Already next generation of farmers are moving away from farming and this could have a catastrophic effect on who will feed the 125 crore people, which is not a small number. Also, if the Indian economy has to clock a double-digit growth on a sustained basis, the farm sector has to grow by at least 4% annually on a continuous basis, which has not happened so far. This is necessary to ensure poverty is eradicated.For the woes of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu farmers, Pattanayak said they should change their cropping pattern from water-guzzling crops like paddy and sugarcane and switch over to drip irrigation, which will reduce water consumption drastically. It is a crime to cultivate sugarcane in Maharashtra. Sugarcane should be cultivated in flood-prone areas of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and perhaps the Northeast as it could also be flood protected.Punjab should not be cultivating basmati rice. The practice of which has brought down the water table to a dangerous level. Israel, which has a mere 300 mm of average rainfall, did not find water shortage a major problem and its farm yield is one of the highest. India gets bountiful rainfall and perhaps one of the few countries to have monsoon as a season every year.Even in the arid zones of Rajasthan and Karnataka, the average rainfall is around 800 mm, which is more than double that of Israel. All one has to do is harness this through rainwater harvesting so that fresh water does not go unutilised into the sea. The government, therefore, is rightly giving priority to minor irrigation and desilting of all the existing tanks, besides immediately taking up 99 stalled irrigation projects. This has to be done on a war footing.What is needed now is to make agriculture smart, which has not happened so far in India despite the Green Revolution that only ensured there are no more starvation deaths. Farmers income needs to be not only doubled but at least quadrupled from the present level of Rs 20,000 annually. One way could be to provide income support as in the US instead of price support by way of Minimum Support Price (MSP). Because of high MSP for certain crops like food grains, rich farmers grow these crops to take advantage of procurement as only they have a marketable surplus.The top 10% of Indian farmers produce 60-70% of marketable surplus in food grains. The remaining 90% have only 30% of marketable surplus and hence they get very little benefit from the price support system. The resulting depression of prices for poor farmers in the market leads to distress sale of the small quantity they produce.If income support is given instead, market forces will come into play and the farmer can produce any crop that the market demands and not only those that have price support, which leads to excess production and subsequent depression of prices. This will also ensure that crop failures do not hit farmers hard.If farmers income has to rise, the dependence only on agriculture for income has to change and farmers will have to take to animal husbandry, poultry, fisheries, food processing and other agri-related rural industries and so on for augmenting income. This is because farming by its very nature is seasonal and hence there is disguised unemployment even in the best of times.As the Swaminathan Committee has pointed out, market access to poor farmers is a major problem in India. Bumper tomato crop forces a farmer to sell it at Re 1 per kg but in the retail market, it is not available for less than Rs 20. But Re 1 does not cover even the cost of production. A farmer gets Rs 6 per coconut but in the retail market, it is not available for less than Rs 40. Who then gets the benefit? It is neither the farmer nor the consumer but the rich middlemen.So what is the way out? An Amul like cooperative model that brought about the White Revolution has to be replicated for all crops so that farmers get a remunerative price and the food products are marketed better and exported. The wastage of fruit, vegetables and other crops running into thousands of crores can be minimised. This will facilitate setting up of common cold storage for horticulture produce in areas where they are grown.Amul like cooperatives will also ensure crop insurance, better quality seeds, pesticides and other inputs, thereby minimising crop failures and loss of farm income.--(The writer is a senior journalist based in New Delhi)","one of the oldest civilisations, the indus valley civilisation, vanished because of persistent drought. this is a stark reminder to policymakers that they will have to tackle persistent drought in parts of the country failing which civilisation could disappear in a couple of centuries. farm crisis in india is real, particularly in states like karnataka and tamil nadu, which is going to witness yet another drought this year despite good monsoon forecast for the third consecutive year in the rest of the country.this is one side of the coin but agriculture secretary s k pattanayak, a karnataka cadre ias officer, argues that all is not bad with indian agriculture. it has come a long way and this year india is going to have a bumper crop with food grain production touching a record 275 million tonnes, while horticulture, including fruits and vegetables, will produce a record additional 300 million tonnes. also, the country has had a record bumper harvest of 23.6 million tonnes in pulses, the only source of protein to the vast vegetarian population.but the stark reality is that farming is the livelihood for half of the 1.25 billion people of india. a farmer must get a remunerative price and adequate income. already next generation of farmers are moving away from farming and this could have a catastrophic effect on who will feed the 125 crore people, which is not a small number. also, if the indian economy has to clock a double-digit growth on a sustained basis, the farm sector has to grow by at least 4% annually on a continuous basis, which has not happened so far. this is necessary to ensure poverty is eradicated.for the woes of karnataka and tamil nadu farmers, pattanayak said they should change their cropping pattern from water-guzzling crops like paddy and sugarcane and switch over to drip irrigation, which will reduce water consumption drastically. it is a crime to cultivate sugarcane in maharashtra. sugarcane should be cultivated in flood-prone areas of bihar and uttar pradesh and perhaps the northeast as it could also be flood protected.punjab should not be cultivating basmati rice. the practice of which has brought down the water table to a dangerous level. israel, which has a mere 300 mm of average rainfall, did not find water shortage a major problem and its farm yield is one of the highest. india gets bountiful rainfall and perhaps one of the few countries to have monsoon as a season every year.even in the arid zones of rajasthan and karnataka, the average rainfall is around 800 mm, which is more than double that of israel. all one has to do is harness this through rainwater harvesting so that fresh water does not go unutilised into the sea. the government, therefore, is rightly giving priority to minor irrigation and desilting of all the existing tanks, besides immediately taking up 99 stalled irrigation projects. this has to be done on a war footing.what is needed now is to make agriculture smart, which has not happened so far in india despite the green revolution that only ensured there are no more starvation deaths. farmers income needs to be not only doubled but at least quadrupled from the present level of rs 20,000 annually. one way could be to provide income support as in the us instead of price support by way of minimum support price (msp). because of high msp for certain crops like food grains, rich farmers grow these crops to take

5ce5df16e8e3fc56af40fa0a,A tale of two States,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-tale-of-two-states/article25694572.ece,2018-12-08,,The Hindu,"A few farmers sit huddled near a statue of Sardar Patel at Balaguda village in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh pouring out their woes over steaming cups of tea. The statue marks the entry point to the Patidar-dominated village.One of them, Manoj Patidar, who has just returned from the Mandsaur wholesale market, says that the goods and services tax (GST) and rising prices of diesel have made agriculture a loss-making activity. If the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government stays for another five years, we will have to sell our lands, says the tall farmer, his wry smile deepening the lines on his weather-worn face.In another place and State  in Rajasthan  separated by distance as well as priorities, Chhatar Singh Rathore of Tena village in Shergarh tehsil in Jodhpur district has a very different concern.He runs a roadside dhaba on National Highway 114, which connects Jodhpur to Jaisalmer. His main complaint concerns what he believes to be the wilful disregard of Rajput sentiment. Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, who is seeking a second consecutive term in office, he says, has humiliated Rajputs by not backing their opposition to the film Padmaavat , and also marginalising Manvendra Singh, son of former Union Minister Jaswant Singh, who is a Rajput.With not much farming visible in the entire region, caste is the primary marker of social identity, unlike in Madhya Pradesh, where locals display a clear sense of identity as farmers. The contrast between Mandsaur and Shergarh points to the differences between two worlds. While both are rural, one is agrarian and the other is dominated by an array of non-farm activities.On November 30, all eyes were on New Delhi where there was a massive protest by farmers who had gathered from all over the country in the thousands. Opposition leaders such as Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, and CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury spoke. This event came in the wake of another landmark protest held more than a year ago.In the middle of last year, farmers organisations had taken out a rally that touched Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, among other places. The participants also visited Mandsaur, where, a month earlier, five farmers had been killed in police firing. Weighed down by debts, the agitating farmers were demanding loan waivers.As politics heats up in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the Opposition sees farmer anger as having the potential to dent the prospects of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has performed well in most State elections held since it came to power in 2014. The reading is not far off the mark. The BJP scraped through in its stronghold of Gujarat in the 2017 Assembly elections, as a result of urban votes. The Congress, on the other hand, did well in rural Gujarat.However, one was able to get an idea of the situation while travelling through Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan over the last month. In a complex picture, the rural cannot always be conflated with the agrarian.Long list of woesMadhya Pradesh today presents a picture of rural discontent that is cementing an amorphous farmers identity  a sort of occupational consciousness  that the ruling BJP will have to be wary of in the future. But the same does not hold true in Rajasthan, where the rural sector is involved in an array of occupations  from stone mining and animal husbandry to forays into the hospitality sector through highway and city restaurants. There is nothing like a farmers identity across the vast, parched, swathes of Indias largest State by land area.It takes half an hour to reach Pipliya Mandi, the epicentre of last years farm unrest, on the road from Mandsaur to Neemuch town in Madhya Pradesh. Mukesh Patidar, a soyabean farmer in his mid-30s, has come to the mandi (wholesale market) to buy agricultural implements. My village, Chilot Pipliya, which is about 17-18 kilometres from here, saw one farmer become a shaheed (martyr) last year, he says. He adds that soybean farmers are a distressed lot, with a long list of grievances.If the fertilizer DAP (Diammonium Phosphate) cost Rs. 800-900 per 50 kg in 2013-14, it is now priced at Rs. 1,440 for 45 kg, he says. Potash, which was priced at Rs. 450 per 50 kg one-two years ago, now costs Rs. 900 kg, he adds.We use tractors to prepare our fields for the crop. They run on diesel, which has gone up from Rs. 50 a litre to around Rs. 70 a litre, Patidar says. And labour charges have also gone up from Rs. 150-200 to Rs. 300 a day now. Why will they work for less? They are getting grain at Rs. 1-2 a kg.He predicts that the BJP will lose votes in villages around Pipliya Mandi this time. Dilip Patidar, a farm activist who also runs a shop selling various agricultural goods, says the GST has made things difficult for farmers. He says, The GST on pesticide is 28% now. These were taxed at 0-4% earlier. Look at the motor that pumps water to fields. It was taxed at 6% earlier but attracts 12% GST now. The pipe to connect the motor to the fields attracted no tax earlier but attracts 12-18% GST now.All this has made farm inputs dearer. Of the entire area under soyabean cultivation in India, about half is in Madhya Pradesh, the soyabean State of India. The Malwa region, of which Mandsaur is a part, accounts for more than half of M.P.s cultivation of the kharif crop. Fields are prepared by tractor in the summer months. Renting is the norm for small and medium farmers and tractors are rented out for Rs. 700 per hour, up from Rs. 500 because of diesel price hikes. The cost of soyabean seeds, Dilip Patidar says, is Rs. 5,400 per quintal. Labour charges for sowing as well as harvesting have gone up, he adds.Electricity bills too have shot up. While it is possible to run a diesel engine instead of an electric motor to pump water into the fields, with diesel prices going up, it is becoming an expensive proposition now as with diesel becoming more expensive, with costs are Rs. 200 per hour.The soyabean produce is transported to the mandis (wholesale markets) in Pipliya Mandi, Mandsaur and Neemuch. Here again, transportation is more expensive because of the rise in diesel prices. The present minimum support price (MSP) for soyabean is Rs. 3,399 per quintal, but it sells in mandis at Rs. 2,800-3,100 per quintal.In 2013-14, the mandi prices had gone up to Rs. 4,500-5,000 per quintal, says Mukesh Patidar. He blames faulty export-import policies for the fall in prices.Mandi prices keep fluctuating on a demand-and-supply basis, and vary each day. Says a wholesale trader at the Mandsaur Mandi who refuses to be identified, These are like the stock market. It is partly the luck of the farmer and partly his ability to read trends that determine the price he gets for his produce.Look at onions. When prices begin to rise, they import these and the prices fall again, says Dilip Patidar.Indeed, the interests of farmers and consumers are at odds. When the prices of farm produce rise, the commissions of wholesale traders and other intermediaries in the supply chain push up the retail prices of farm produce. When prices fall, food price inflation ceases to be a problem but farmers face losses, rendering agriculture unprofitable as an occupation.For example, at the Ajmer vegetable wholesale market, tomatoes were selling at Rs. 8 a kg. On the previous two days, 1 kg was was selling at Rs. 10 and Rs. 12, respectively. Just 2 km away at the retail market, it was selling at Rs. 20.The dip in farm fortunes is visibly impacting the politics of Madhya Pradesh, a traditional BJP stronghold, with the Congress clawing back in the villages. The troubles of increased documentation, paperwork and bank payments,  seen by many as a part of the formalisation of the sector and cleaning up of the system  have also annoyed farmers.The M.P. government has put in place a subsidy scheme called Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (BBY), under which the government promises to plug the gap between market prices and the minimum support price (MSP). But to avail it, a farmer has to register himself at an authorised office and produce the required documents at the grain and vegetable market when he goes to sell his produce.Says Sunil Solanki, a farmer: Our soyabean crop gets a subsidy of Rs. 500 a quintal. But for this we have to submit a copy of our documents to the mandi merchant, who submits our farmer code numbers to the official market committee and then credits the money to our accounts, a process which takes between 10 and 15 days. The government subsidy under the BBY, he adds, takes two to three months to get credited to a farmers bank account. Unlike farmers elsewhere, farmers in M.P. are not paid in cash as everything is digitised.In other words, say several farmers, they pay in cash for labour, for renting tractors, and to transport the produce, but get paid by bank transfer. The time lag results in a cash crunch. They complain of long queues at markets and banks. Sensing this as an opportunity, Congress leaders have begun to promise cash payments to farmers if voted to power, according to local residents.Economist Utsa Patnaik says that the coming together of farmers across classes  the poor and the rich  was long overdue. She says: There has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. There has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation, and the displaced will be absorbed by industry. The experience of Europe was different. Rather than being absorbed in industry there, the displaced were exported to North America, Australia and South Africa, and they captured the resources there after subduing indigenous people. We dont have that option.She adds: The open trade policies have exposed farmers to the highs and lows of global prices, which they cannot withstand. The meaning of priority sector has also changed under the influence of neoliberal policies, and farmers are unable to access low-interest loans. They have to borrow from private lenders at high interest rates and end up in a debt trap. It is only now that people have begun to notice the farm unrest that was waiting to burst forth.Other sources of incomeFew farmers can be seen at the Ajmer wholesale vegetable market after 11 a.m. They come here at 3 a.m. and leave after selling their produce  in return for cash payments  by 9-10 a.m. The mandi lacks the scale of operations or the frenzied activity of, say, the Surat wholesale market or even Azadpur Mandi in Delhi.The reason is not hard to find. This correspondents journey through Rajasthan, across 2,100 km, covering Jaipur, Tonk, Ajmer, Sawai Madhopur, Nagaur, Pali and Jodhpur districts, showed farm activity present only in the villages close to Tonk.Rasoolpuri village, which has high Gujjar and Meena populations, has farmland where mustard is grown. Here, farmers complain about rising diesel and fertilizer prices and the limited supply of water, which is available only from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. The produce, they say, sells at Rs. 3,200 a quintal, much below the MSP of Rs. 4,200.Farmers at a tea stall just outside the village say they will vote for the Congress as they are fed up of having their concerns brushed aside.But most of rural Rajasthan is a very different world. Villages, even around Jaipur, for miles on end have hardly any farm activity. The better off among villagers have diversified into non-farm activities such as dairy and poultry, while the poor are into animal grazing or work as labourers in construction activities and other sectors.A 40-minute drive on the Jodhpur-Jaisalmer highway leads to the Balesar-Shergarh belt, an arid, sparsely populated area dotted with Rajput-dominated villages. A detour from the highway down a narrow, broken road reveals what substitutes for farming in this region: stone-mining for the construction sector is in full swing on both sides of the road.Meghlasia is a village with Meghwal (Scheduled Caste) and Rajpurohit families. The latter, who describe themselves as gurus of Rajputs, are Brahmins by caste.Stone-mining is a key source of income for the villagers. In addition, they also sow bajra (millet) after the first rains in June-July, but the yield is subject to the vagaries of the monsoon rains.Caste is the markerLike many other Rajputs who have opened restaurants or dhabas because there is not enough water for farming, Chhatar Singh Rathore of the Rajput-dominated Tena village too runs one on the road towards Jodhpur.Says Rathore, Many people in my village run restaurants on the highway. The richer Rajputs also own restaurants in Jodhpur. There are 10 restaurants in the city run by people from my village.He tries to summarise his villages sources of income: Our previous generation saw many people join the Indian Army. You will find many ex-servicemen here. This generation has taken to the restaurant-catering sector in a major way. That apart, many from the village have migrated to Surat to join the cloth industry where they specialise in designing and packing. Some even race horses in Dubai.The Rajput community in the State has gravitated towards the hospitality sector, with heritage hotels and havelis dotting the State. Many are owned by richer Rajput families. They have a traditional feel and visible Rajput markers such as photographs of men in traditional attire holding a sword or rifle. A lot of them try to attract foreign tourists.This non-farm rural world is in sharp contrast to that of M.P., where an occupational identity centred on farming is being forged. In Shergarh tehsil of Jodhpur, caste remains the prominent identity marker, with cultural issues occupying centrestage.Rathore is unhappy with the Rajasthan government for not standing behind Rajputs on the film Padmaavat . He complains that Vasundhara Raje got the entrance to the Raj Mahal Palace in Jaipur sealed to target former royal Diya Kumari, and also humiliated the family of BJP veteran Jaswant Singh.In Tibna village, about 90 km from Jodhpur, water supply poses an acute problem. Sarpanch Bhawani Singh Rathore points to a dry hand pump which is wrapped in a sack cloth. The village has houses placed wide apart, and is populated longitudinally, one house after another for a few kilometres. It has just 300 families, says the sarpanch, of which 150 are Rajput. Other than water, villagers also complain about the lack of school teachers in the local government school. However, despite their various frustrations, they do not think of themselves as aggrieved farmers. Caste remains the key marker of identity and status.You find three types of scenarios, says political analyst and author Sajjan Kumar. The first is Madhya Pradesh, where agriculture is linked to the market, with cash crops such as soyabean and cotton. Here, farming is under stress because of a fall in market prices and the impact of demonetisation. The second is seen in agrarian States such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (excluding western U.P.). Their agriculture is not linked to the market, with mainly food crops such as rice and wheat being produced. An arid State such as Rajasthan presents a third scenario, where agriculture is not central to rural life.He explains the significance of these diverse realities: An occupational identity, where people identify as farmers, is emerging in States of the first kind, such as M.P., Maharashtra and Gujarat. In States such as U.P. and Bihar, while agriculture is central to rural life, caste and religion remain dominant identity markers in the absence of strong market linkages of agriculture. In Rajasthan, in the near absence of agriculture as a key rural vocation, identity markers are still tied to caste.Rathores sentiments lend credence to this hypothesis. I have no problem with [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi. He says we should sell pakodas if we can and I have been doing so at my restaurant, he says. My problem is with Vasundhara Raje. Rajputs will try to ensure a victory for Manvendra Singh at Jhalrapatan. What is a Rajput without self-respect?There has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. There has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation.Utsa Patnaik,Economist","a few farmers sit huddled near a statue of sardar patel at balaguda village in mandsaur, madhya pradesh pouring out their woes over steaming cups of tea. the statue marks the entry point to the patidar-dominated village.one of them, manoj patidar, who has just returned from the mandsaur wholesale market, says that the goods and services tax (gst) and rising prices of diesel have made agriculture a loss-making activity. if the shivraj singh chouhan government stays for another five years, we will have to sell our lands, says the tall farmer, his wry smile deepening the lines on his weather-worn face.in another place and state  in rajasthan  separated by distance as well as priorities, chhatar singh rathore of tena village in shergarh tehsil in jodhpur district has a very different concern.he runs a roadside dhaba on national highway 114, which connects jodhpur to jaisalmer. his main complaint concerns what he believes to be the wilful disregard of rajput sentiment. rajasthan chief minister vasundhara raje, who is seeking a second consecutive term in office, he says, has humiliated rajputs by not backing their opposition to the film padmaavat , and also marginalising manvendra singh, son of former union minister jaswant singh, who is a rajput.with not much farming visible in the entire region, caste is the primary marker of social identity, unlike in madhya pradesh, where locals display a clear sense of identity as farmers. the contrast between mandsaur and shergarh points to the differences between two worlds. while both are rural, one is agrarian and the other is dominated by an array of non-farm activities.on november 30, all eyes were on new delhi where there was a massive protest by farmers who had gathered from all over the country in the thousands. opposition leaders such as congress president rahul gandhi, delhi chief minister arvind kejriwal, and cpi(m) general secretary sitaram yechury spoke. this event came in the wake of another landmark protest held more than a year ago.in the middle of last year, farmers organisations had taken out a rally that touched madhya pradesh, maharashtra, gujarat and rajasthan, among other places. the participants also visited mandsaur, where, a month earlier, five farmers had been killed in police firing. weighed down by debts, the agitating farmers were demanding loan waivers.as politics heats up in the run-up to the 2019 lok sabha election, the opposition sees farmer anger as having the potential to dent the prospects of the ruling bharatiya janata party (bjp), which has performed well in most state elections held since it came to power in 2014. the reading is not far off the mark. the bjp scraped through in its stronghold of gujarat in the 2017 assembly elections, as a result of urban votes. the congress, on the other hand, did well in rural gujarat.however, one was able to get an idea of the situation while travelling through madhya pradesh and rajasthan over the last month. in a complex picture, the rural cannot always be conflated with the agrarian.long list of woesmadhya pradesh today presents a picture of rural discontent that is cementing an amorphous farmers identity  a sort of occupational consciousness  that the ruling bjp will have to be wary of in the future. but the same does not hold true in rajasthan, where the rural sector is involved in an array of occupations  from stone mining and animal husbandry to forays into the hospitality sector through highway and city restaurants. there is nothing like a farmers identity across the vast, parched, swathes of indias largest state by land area.it takes half an hour to reach pipliya mandi, the epicentre of last years farm unrest, on the road from mandsaur to neemuch town in madhya pradesh. mukesh patidar, a soyabean farmer in his mid-30s, has come to the mandi (wholesale market) to buy agricultural implements. my village, chilot pipliya, which is about 17-18 kilometres from here, saw one farmer become a shaheed (martyr) last year, he says. he adds that soybean farmers are a distressed lot, with a long list of grievances.if the fertilizer dap (diammonium phosphate) cost rs. 800-900 per 50 kg in 2013-14, it is now priced at rs. 1,440 for 45 kg, he says. potash, which was priced at rs. 450 per 50 kg one-two years ago, now costs rs. 900 kg, he adds.we use tractors to prepare our fields for the crop. they run on diesel, which has gone up from rs. 50 a litre to around rs. 70 a litre, patidar says. and labour charges have also gone up from rs. 150-200 to rs. 300 a day now. why will they work for less? they are getting grain at rs. 1-2 a kg.he predicts that the bjp will lose votes in villages around pipliya mandi this time. dilip patidar, a farm activist who also runs a shop selling various agricultural goods, says the gst has made things difficult for farmers. he says, the gst on pesticide is 28% now. these were taxed at 0-4% earlier. look at the motor that pumps water to fields. it was taxed at 6% earlier but attracts 12% gst now. the pipe to connect the motor to the fields attracted no tax earlier but attracts 12-18% gst now.all this has made farm inputs dearer. of the entire area under soyabean cultivation in india, about half is in madhya pradesh, the soyabean state of india. the malwa region, of which mandsaur is a part, accounts for more than half of m.p.s cultivation of the kharif crop. fields are prepared by tractor in the summer months. renting is the norm for small and medium farmers and tractors are rented out for rs. 700 per hour, up from rs. 500 because of diesel price hikes. the cost of soyabean seeds, dilip patidar says, is rs. 5,400 per quintal. labour charges for sowing as well as harvesting have gone up, he adds.electricity bills too have shot up. while it is possible to run a diesel engine instead of an electric motor to pump water into the fields, with diesel prices going up, it is becoming an expensive proposition now as with diesel becoming more expensive, with costs are rs. 200 per hour.the soyabean produce is transported to the mandis (wholesale markets) in pipliya mandi, mandsaur and neemuch. here again, transportation is more expensive because of the rise in diesel prices. the present minimum support price (msp) for soyabean is rs. 3,399 per quintal, but it sells in mandis at rs. 2,800-3,100 per quintal.in 2013-14, the mandi prices had gone up to rs. 4,500-5,000 per quintal, says mukesh patidar. he blames faulty export-import policies for the fall in prices.mandi prices keep fluctuating on a demand-and-supply basis, and vary each day. says a wholesale trader at the mandsaur mandi who refuses to be identified, these are like the stock market. it is partly the luck of the farmer and partly his ability to read trends that determine the price he gets for his produce.look at onions. when prices begin to rise, they import these and the prices fall again, says dilip patidar.indeed, the interests of farmers and consumers are at odds. when the prices of farm produce rise, the commissions of wholesale traders and other intermediaries in the supply chain push up the retail prices of farm produce. when prices fall, food price inflation ceases to be a problem but farmers face losses, rendering agriculture unprofitable as an occupation.for example, at the ajmer vegetable wholesale market, tomatoes were selling at rs. 8 a kg. on the previous two days, 1 kg was was selling at rs. 10 and rs. 12, respectively. just 2 km away at the retail market, it was selling at rs. 20.the dip in farm fortunes is visibly impacting the politics of madhya pradesh, a traditional bjp stronghold, with the congress clawing back in the villages. the troubles of increased documentation, paperwork and bank payments,  seen by many as a part of the formalisation of the sector and cleaning up of the system  have also annoyed farmers.the m.p. government has put in place a subsidy scheme called bhavantar bhugtan yojana (bby), under which the government promises to plug the gap between market prices and the minimum support price (msp). but to avail it, a farmer has to register himself at an authorised office and produce the required documents at the grain and vegetable market when he goes to sell his produce.says sunil solanki, a farmer: our soyabean crop gets a subsidy of rs. 500 a quintal. but for this we have to submit a copy of our documents to the mandi merchant, who submits our farmer code numbers to the official market committee and then credits the money to our accounts, a process which takes between 10 and 15 days. the government subsidy under the bby, he adds, takes two to three months to get credited to a farmers bank account. unlike farmers elsewhere, farmers in m.p. are not paid in cash as everything is digitised.in other words, say several farmers, they pay in cash for labour, for renting tractors, and to transport the produce, but get paid by bank transfer. the time lag results in a cash crunch. they complain of long queues at markets and banks. sensing this as an opportunity, congress leaders have begun to promise cash payments to farmers if voted to power, according to local residents.economist utsa patnaik says that the coming together of farmers across classes  the poor and the rich  was long overdue. she says: there has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. there has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation, and the displaced will be absorbed by industry. the experience of europe was different. rather than being absorbed in industry there, the displaced were exported to north america, australia and south africa, and they captured the resources there after subduing indigenous people. we dont have that option.she adds: the open trade policies have exposed farmers to the highs and lows of global prices, which they cannot withstand. the meaning of priority sector has also changed under the influence of neoliberal policies, and farmers are unable to access low-interest loans. they have to borrow from private lenders at high interest rates and end up in a debt trap. it is only now that people have begun to notice the farm unrest that was waiting to burst forth.other sources of incomefew farmers can be seen at the ajmer wholesale vegetable market after 11 a.m. they come here at 3 a.m. and leave after selling their produce  in return for cash payments  by 9-10 a.m. the mandi lacks the scale of operations or the frenzied activity of, say, the surat wholesale market or even azadpur mandi in delhi.the reason is not hard to find. this correspondents journey through rajasthan, across 2,100 km, covering jaipur, tonk, ajmer, sawai madhopur, nagaur, pali and jodhpur districts, showed farm activity present only in the villages close to tonk.rasoolpuri village, which has high gujjar and meena populations, has farmland where mustard is grown. here, farmers complain about rising diesel and fertilizer prices and the limited supply of water, which is available only from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. the produce, they say, sells at rs. 3,200 a quintal, much below the msp of rs. 4,200.farmers at a tea stall just outside the village say they will vote for the congress as they are fed up of having their concerns brushed aside.but most of rural rajasthan is a very different world. villages, even around jaipur, for miles on end have hardly any farm activity. the better off among villagers have diversified into non-farm activities such as dairy and poultry, while the poor are into animal grazing or work as labourers in construction activities and other sectors.a 40-minute drive on the jodhpur-jaisalmer highway leads to the balesar-shergarh belt, an arid, sparsely populated area dotted with rajput-dominated villages. a detour from the highway down a narrow, broken road reveals what substitutes for farming in this region: stone-mining for the construction sector is in full swing on both sides of the road.meghlasia is a village with meghwal (scheduled caste) and rajpurohit families. the latter, who describe themselves as gurus of rajputs, are brahmins by caste.stone-mining is a
