In distant rural areas, local vegetable prices  both wholesale and retail  have crashed as the oxygen of currency has been suddenly sucked out. Since the whole economy depended on cash, from transport to mandis to purchase prices, this is unsurprising.But in cities, where there is more liquidity, vegetable arrivals in mandis have increased and wholesale prices have dropped but, surprise, retail prices have remained largely unaffected or are only slightly lower.An analysis of arrivals and prices data from 29 big cities from major states and Delhi shows that for a range of common vegetables, arrivals in mandis have actually gone up since November 8 when 500 and 1,000-rupee notes were rendered invalid. There has been an increase in arrivals of vegetables in many cities across India, including Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Patna and Guwahati.Wholesale traders in Delhi say this was driven by the fact that cash payments were still possible in bigger cities, unlike small rural markets. So, in the surrounding areas, there was a move to sell the produce in urban areas.As a result, barring okra (bhindi) and onions, the quantities of common vegetables like cauliflower, potato, tomato, cabbage, gourds, chillies, brinjal and peas reaching daily in wholesale markets of these cities increased by 10-30% between the week preceding November 8 and the fortnight following it. This should have led to falling vegetable prices for urban consumers. But that was not to be.Wholesale traders seem to have bargained with the desperate producers to push down wholesale or purchase prices substantially but did not pass on the full benefit to consumers. In all the big cities, data shows wholesale prices dipping in the post-demonetisation fortnight compared to the week before. In Delhi, for example, cauliflower, brinjal (round) and cabbage wholesale prices fell by over 50% each, peas and potatoes by about 40% and tomatoes by 13%.Onion prices increased by 14%, possibly because it is not as perishable as other vegetables and hence it was being held back. Okra prices increased by 23% for unknown reasons. But at the local sabziwallah, prices are at their usual levels, except for a downward trend in cauliflower, brinjal and cabbage  all dipping by over a third post-demonetisation.Onion prices have increased by 21%, reflecting the rise in wholesale prices. ""This is the rate we are getting at the mandi. The wholesalers are making money, not us,"" said Mangat Ram, a vegetable seller in East Delhi who claimed that his sales had dipped since November 8.","in the finely balanced but lucrative economy of vegetable and fruit trade, demonetisation has had a bizarre effect. in distant rural areas, local vegetable prices  both wholesale and retail  have crashed as the oxygen of currency has been suddenly sucked out. since the whole economy depended on cash, from transport to mandis to purchase prices, this is unsurprising.but in cities, where there is more liquidity, vegetable arrivals in mandis have increased and wholesale prices have dropped but, surprise, retail prices have remained largely unaffected or are only slightly lower.an analysis of arrivals and prices data from 29 big cities from major states and delhi shows that for a range of common vegetables, arrivals in mandis have actually gone up since november 8 when 500 and 1,000-rupee notes were rendered invalid. there has been an increase in arrivals of vegetables in many cities across india, including bengaluru, chennai, kolkata, mumbai, pune, hyderabad, patna and guwahati.wholesale traders in delhi say this was driven by the fact that cash payments were still possible in bigger cities, unlike small rural markets. so, in the surrounding areas, there was a move to sell the produce in urban areas.as a result, barring okra (bhindi) and onions, the quantities of common vegetables like cauliflower, potato, tomato, cabbage, gourds, chillies, brinjal and peas reaching daily in wholesale markets of these cities increased by 10-30% between the week preceding november 8 and the fortnight following it. this should have led to falling vegetable prices for urban consumers. but that was not to be.wholesale traders seem to have bargained with the desperate producers to push down wholesale or purchase prices substantially but did not pass on the full benefit to consumers. in all the big cities, data shows wholesale prices dipping in the post-demonetisation fortnight compared to the week before. in delhi, for example, cauliflower, brinjal (round) and cabbage wholesale prices fell by over 50% each, peas and potatoes by about 40% and tomatoes by 13%.onion prices increased by 14%, possibly because it is not as perishable as other vegetables and hence it was being held back. okra prices increased by 23% for unknown reasons. but at the local sabziwallah, prices are at their usual levels, except for a downward trend in cauliflower, brinjal and cabbage  all dipping by over a third post-demonetisation.onion prices have increased by 21%, reflecting the rise in wholesale prices.

Express Sandeep Mohans latest film Shreelancer narrates the story of a freelancer who grapples with nagging self-doubts about pursuing an artistic life. ExpressIF life throws stones and tomatoes at him, he would collect it and make a comedy about Stones and Tomatoes. Thats Sandeep Mohan for you, an indie filmmaker and the man behind The Great Indian Travelling Cinema initiative. As part of this initiative, his latest film Shreelancer was in Chandigarh recently. Shreelancer narrates the story of a freelancer named Shree,in his mid 20s, as he tries to grapple with nagging self-doubts about pursuing an artistic life.Watch what else is making news:Unlike my earlier films  Love Wrinkle Free & Hola Venky, which were termedcomedies, Shreelancer might be slotted as drama. Also in my previous films, the protagonists were in their mid 30sin Shreelancer, for the first time, I am delving into the mind of a mid-20s freelancer. It is a contemporary story told in an engaging manner, says Mohan, who has developed his own kind of cinema  guerilla style, candid, witty, full of observations and reflections on life and people. Cinema for him is a constant process for exploration, and he hopes he doesnt discover fully what cinema is, because then the charm goes out. I want the mystery and magic to remain forever.With the final mix of Shreelancer over just 10 days back, this is the first screening of the film in Chandigarh. Mohan is also travelling with it to alternative spaces across the country as part of his The Great Indian Travelling Cinema experiment. One of the reasons for screening here was that a few of the cast members are from Chandigarh  Chandan Singh Gill, Karanveer Khullar, Vivek Sharma, Krishan Rathee, Nikhar DanielI also shot a part of the film here. There is something charming and big-hearted about this city, says Mohan.Born in Jabalpur, he moved to Mumbai at the age of 21. Being an independent spirit who prefers to learn by making mistakes rather than be taught by an authoritative figure, independent cinema seemed to be the right choice for Mohan. For someone who consciously stays away from film festival circuit and is allergic to the censor board, he conceptualised The Great Indian Travelling Cinema. A one man experiment, Mohan travels to various cities and screens his film. The idea is to see the film with an audience and learn something, while watching and interacting with them. Since my films fall between mainstream and film festival films, I have to see for myself that there is an audience for my films and travelling cinema screenings help. I soak in the energy, feel motivated, and then go back and write another film exactly the way I want to, reassured that there is an audience. However, he would love to go through the festival route for his films. Ideally one would want a right mix of a limited theatrical release, film fest rounds, travelling cinema screenings and a good online release on bigger platforms. To sell the film in India and for satellite rights etc, you need a censor. So, I might have to take one for Shreelancer. It was for my last film Hola Venky that I refused to take a censor and went around travelling and screening it in 92 cities, he says.Its a space where survival is tough, and Mohan feels one has to be very strong internally and think long term. Indie filmmaking wont make you rich but happier especially if you have creative control and if you go about it a little smartly, then you can even survive well. Money will follow for there are better things to run after in life, he adds. He agrees that with Netflix and Amazons coming in, viewing habits will changeit is good time for filmmakers who budget their films correct and tell a good story. As for demonetisation, I downloaded the Paytm app and ask people to pay through it after My Great Indian Travelling Cinema screenings.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now","sandeep mohans latest film shreelancer narrates the story of a freelancer who grapples with nagging self-doubts about pursuing an artistic life. express sandeep mohans latest film shreelancer narrates the story of a freelancer who grapples with nagging self-doubts about pursuing an artistic life. expressif life throws stones and tomatoes at him, he would collect it and make a comedy about stones and tomatoes. thats sandeep mohan for you, an indie filmmaker and the man behind the great indian travelling cinema initiative. as part of this initiative, his latest film shreelancer was in chandigarh recently. shreelancer narrates the story of a freelancer named shree,in his mid 20s, as he tries to grapple with nagging self-doubts about pursuing an artistic life.watch what else is making news:unlike my earlier films  love wrinkle free & hola venky, which were termedcomedies, shreelancer might be slotted as drama. also in my previous films, the protagonists were in their mid 30sin shreelancer, for the first time, i am delving into the mind of a mid-20s freelancer. it is a contemporary story told in an engaging manner, says mohan, who has developed his own kind of cinema  guerilla style, candid, witty, full of observations and reflections on life and people. cinema for him is a constant process for exploration, and he hopes he doesnt discover fully what cinema is, because then the charm goes out. i want the mystery and magic to remain forever.with the final mix of shreelancer over just 10 days back, this is the first screening of the film in chandigarh. mohan is also travelling with it to alternative spaces across the country as part of his the great indian travelling cinema experiment. one of the reasons for screening here was that a few of the cast members are from chandigarh  chandan singh gill, karanveer khullar, vivek sharma, krishan rathee, nikhar danieli also shot a part of the film here. there is something charming and big-hearted about this city, says mohan.born in jabalpur, he moved to mumbai at the age of 21. being an independent spirit who prefers to learn by making mistakes rather than be taught by an authoritative figure, independent cinema seemed to be the right choice for mohan. for someone who consciously stays away from film festival circuit and is allergic to the censor board, he conceptualised the great indian travelling cinema. a one man experiment, mohan travels to various cities and screens his film. the idea is to see the film with an audience and learn something, while watching and interacting with them. since my films fall between mainstream and film festival films, i have to see for myself that there is an audience for my films and travelling cinema screenings help. i soak in the energy, feel motivated, and then go back and write another film exactly the way i want to, reassured that there is an audience. however, he would love to go through the festival route for his films. ideally one would want a right mix of a limited theatrical release, film fest rounds, travelling cinema screenings and a good online release on bigger platforms. to sell the film in india and for satellite rights etc, you need a censor. so, i might have to take one for shreelancer. it was for my last film hola venky that i refused to take a censor and went around travelling and screening it in 92 cities, he says.its a space where survival is tough, and mohan feels one has to be very strong internally and think long term. indie filmmaking wont make you rich but happier especially if you have creative control and if you go about it a little smartly, then you can even survive well. money will follow for there are better things to run after in life, he adds. he agrees that with netflix and amazons coming in, viewing habits will changeit is good time for filmmakers who budget their films correct and tell a good story. as for demonetisation, i downloaded the paytm app and ask people to pay through it after my great indian travelling cinema screenings.for all the latest india news, download indian express app now"

Mera naam Pablo hai, aapka naam kya hain ? Aap kaise ho ? is stated with a self assurance that makes one think that Agular has spent years in the island city. But the reality is that Agular is a chef in transit. But its a reality that his comrade-in-food, entrepreneur and pastry chef Pooja Dhingra is hoping to change. For the few past weeks, Agular and Dhingra have been working round the clock  to launch the Le15 Caf that will open its doors to patrons today.For Dhingra, this is a dream that she has worked hard to make come true. During the past four years or so, Dhingra has been busy trying to find a suitable spot in South Mumbai to launch a caf, and she almost did. We actually started work on a caf in Breach Candy and then it suddenly fell through and never took off, she says. Pablo was here too. I had called him over to help me.Dhingra met Agular nine years ago, where they both were students at Le Cordon Bleu Paris. She says, He did cuisine and I did pastry. But we never really interacted much. He was working in a caf close to school and that is where all of us went after hours to hang out. Dhingra is clearly admiring of Agulars work ethic, He moved to Paris when he was 18 and worked himself through culinary school. He would do a 10-hour shift and come to school and then study. Then go back to cooking and I would ask him, when do you sleep?So, when Dhingra found the dream location for her caf, right on the street where she wanted it, she promptly dialled Agular to make his way to Mumbai. And he did, Right before I came to Bombay, I used to own two restaurants in Paris. And for some personal reasons, I decided to split from my company. I have been working for close to nine years without taking a vacation, explains the half-Hungarian chef. Right now, I am going through this period in my life where I am going to take some time to enjoy and yet keep working. So coming to India was the perfect opportunity to discover new things.While Dhingra was busy tying up the myriad loose ends that go along with a caf launch  Agular made the long trip to Mumbai. Then they started work on a menu. Between the two, Dhingra and Agular might be able to cook up a storm, but for the cafs offerings, simple has been the motto they have stuck to. She explains, This is an extension of what I have always wanted to do. Dessert is my forte and its what I excel at. But food is something that I was completely clueless about. I had an idea of what I wanted at the caf and that is where Pablo comes in. I wanted a very tight menu. At Le15, we do a few things and we do them well. Theres no point in having a 10-page menu.Agular being agreeable to that thought process, has helped Dhingra develop a far-from predictable menu that has sandwiches, salads, soups and four main courses. For the cafs four-plated desserts; the two named them after French women. For someone who is passionate about chocolate, Dhingras favourite dessert from the menu is a non-cocoa dish that they have dubbed Amlie. You can see her excitement shine through when she describes it while beaming, Its a milk cake, raspberry coulis, pepper crumbs with mint.Agular, chimes in, We arent doing anything to just please people but stuff we like. For example, the burrata  I didnt really want it on my menu because everyone is doing burrata nowadays. But Pooja wanted it so much, that we are doing it. And its become one of the favourite dishes during the tastings. Another dish, the duo is excited about is the crispy parmesan waffle, with tomato sauce and a poached egg and then more parmesan on top.The plan is to keep adding on to the menu as the caf settles into a routine, explains Dhingra, For now, its going to be open from 10.30 am to around 7.30-8 pm for the first few weeks.

Its been a colourful year. Admittedly with social media, its easier to manufacture a trend than track one: all you need is an armful of hashtags.Nevertheless, some trends did stand out this year, and after some earnest scouting, here they are.Put your money where your mouth is: You may not have Ashton Kutchers millions (or his enviable jawline) but you can still invest in a startup. Its an easy route to hipster chic, without the man bun and skinny jeans. More importantly, you have the opportunity to bring fascinating creative projects to life, by investing relatively little money. Bakeys spoons, for example, which are edible spoons made with jowar, rice and wheat flour, raised Rs. 24,92,380 on Ketto.org with 1,571 supporters.Theres Foodstart, which helps restaurants and food trucks raise capital online in small amounts. Barnraiser supporting farmers. And of course, the popular Kickstarter, which has one category just for bacon, along with cook books, vegan, farms, food trucks, restaurants and farmers markets in its food category.Dinner in a box: Meal kits, with pre-measured ingredients, became popular this year. Practically every major Indian city has a company doing these now.Theres iChef in Mumbai, specialising in Malaysian, Burmese and African food. Awesome Chef in Chennai, offering Thai-style peanut noodles, kung pao potatoes and paneer makhani. And Built2Cook in Hyderabad, to name just a few. They enable you to cook quick, easy and exotic dinners for two or four people, and expand your repertoire with confidence.Grow your own food: Cocktail party topics have shifted from bistros in Paris to organic farms in Pollachi. Burnt-out executives are increasingly finding ways to grow their own vegetables. Some quit their jobs and move away from the city for what they describe as a fuller existence, growing rice, digging up potatoes and tending cows. Some buy a couple of acres just outside the city and head there on weekends. An easy, and popular compromise: rooftop and terrace gardening. A tomatos tastier when you grow it on your own.Mesmerised by pancakes: Food videos became big this year, as they got slicker than ever before. Faintly hypnotic and surprisingly relaxing, they easily sliced across geographical and age barriers. Everyone was watching them, though hardly anyone was actually trying the recipes in real life. Among the most popular videos this year were mozzarella stick onion rings, ice cream churro bowls and pizza puff pastry twists, which got a mind-boggling 159,908,933 views.Single origin everything: Coffee, chocolate, vanilla Local artisan produce got better than ever this year, thanks to determined entrepreneurs and an audience that was willing to not just pay for quality, but also educate themselves.Try The Indian Beans Monkey Bitten Coffee, cultivated in the forests of Andhra Pradeshs Araku Valley. Or Blue Tokais roastery, where they simultaneously grind beans, make cappuccinos and hold workshops.Prefer chocolate? Earth Loaf in Mysore, Mason & Co in Auroville and Pascati are creating gourmet, hand-made, organic, locally-sourced, single-origin, bean-to-bar, proudly desi chocolate (phew).Geeking out on coffee: If youre still using capsules, go sit in a corner with your finger on your lips, and think about the impact on the environment. This was the year of responsible handmade coffee. The AeroPress became popular, as did the Moka pot. Need something trendier? Buy and learn how to use the Chemex, vacuum siphon, bee house dripper or filtron cold brewer.A latte a day: Turmeric lattes, coconut lattes, pumpkin lattes... Mornings got a lot more interesting this year. Turmeric lattes, made with almond milk, fresh turmeric and honey, ruled. For the paleo and keto nuts, it was all about bullet-proof coffee made by whipping together coffee, butter and coconut oil. If youre less intense, try a cold brew coffee with coconut, almond or cashew milk.Soup in light bulbs: Unusual platters ruled. We ate cheese on the lid of a wine barrel. Dessert in a flower pot.

58e540f67be9e05a951f68c6,WHOLESALE DESPAIR,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161117/jsp/bihar/story_119658.jsp,2016-11-17,,Telegraph,"Vegetable vendors wait for customersat Anta Ghatin Patna on Wednesday. Picture by Nagendra Kumar Singh Demonetisation has paralysed wholesale markets in the city, be they of grocery  rice, wheat, pulses, spices and suchlike  or fruits. The vegetable wholesale market was also hit in the first two days after the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were banned on November 8, but the demand later recovered. Marufganj market, the citys biggest wholesale market which on an average day notches up sales of not less than Rs 10 crore, is barely doing business worthRs 2.5 crore per day. Lalit Agrawal, a trader from the Marufganj area, said footfall has plummeted by around 75 per cent. The demonetisation has hit business in a big way, Agrawal said. It seems like the will to shop has completely vanished. There are no customers in the market. People are coming with Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, which we are not accepting as it has been scrapped. Very few people have smaller denomination notes or the new Rs 2,000 notes. We are not accepting Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 as we have to deposit those with the banks, and going by the crowd at the banks and ATMs with people lining up for hours its not feasible for us to accept bigger notes. As one travels from market to market, its almost like a chorus  no customers, no money, worries galore. Maharajganj market in Patna City generally sees daily sales of around Rs 2 crore; it is now scraping up just about Rs 25-30 lakh. People are not coming, said Akhilesh, a trader. There is a drop in customers as well as overallsales. The market is usually overcrowded, but nowadays it is silent. Most people now want to meet their basic needs first, and they are saving lower denomination currency notes for emergency situations. Patnas biggest wholesale fruits market, Bazaar Samiti, which generally witnesses huge crowds in the morning, wore a deserted look on Wednesday. The market, which used to have daily sales of more than Rs 10 lakh, has virtually collapsed. Sales at present stand at Rs 1-2 lakh only, said Haji Mohammad Min Alam, president, Patna Food Merchant Association. We accepted Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in the initial two-three days on humanitarian grounds as people come to us from far-flung areas such as Ara, Danapur, Naubatpur, Fatuha. However, we have now stopped accepting the bigger notes and the people are short of lower denomination notes. This has hit the market significantly as people in general are saving the smaller notes for their basic necessities. He added: At times, the situation spirals out of control and there is fear of violence as people insist on paying with Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes as they want to get rid of those. Its not just demand; supply to the markets has been hit as well. Before demonetisation, if 20 trucks used to come daily from other states like Kashmir and Maharashtra, the number now has gone down to five or six, saidRazi Ahmed, another trader. The reason is that we are not beingable to send money to those states. The sellers problem has been further compounded here as they are unable to recover money from retailers, which in turn has made sending money to other states adifficult task. To ensure the fruits dontrot, traders are sending them tocold stores. We dont have hope that the market transactions will revive this month,"" Ahmed added. Another problem we are facing is that the transporters and porters working in the market have also refused to accept the invalid currencies as payments. As a result, several trucks from other states are still stationed here. Another wholesale fruit dealer Wasim said: As fruit markets are cash-oriented markets, scrapping of the bigger notes has brought market activity to a grinding halt. The footfall has fallen by 90 per cent with sales dropping to one-tenth of the usual figures. Unlike malls, transactions here take place in cash. When there is not much cash available, how will people shop? Vegetable markets are the only silver lining. Dinesh, a wholesaler at Anta Ghat, Patnas biggest wholesale market for vegetables, said: During the first two-days, the market witnessed very low turnout of customers as sudden action of the government banning notes left the customers with no choice. Sales had dropped by 50 per cent. The market on a normal day has a daily turnover of around Rs 10-15 lakh. However, as people cannot live without vegetables, they have no choice but to buy them. This necessity brought the customers back to the market. People are paying in smaller notes for buying vegetables. At times, we are also accepting bigger notes if people are buying large quantities just to save the customers from more agony. Prices of vegetables have remained stable. Prices of potato and tomato remain the same as before the demonetisation with potatoes being sold at Rs 20 per kg while tomato ranges between Rs 20-25 per kg, said Another seller, Rajesh Singh, a trader. Onion, which we were earlier selling at Rs 15 per kg, has shot up to Rs 20, but that is due to delay in consignment from Nashik and not due to demonetisation.","vegetable vendors wait for customersat anta ghatin patna on wednesday. picture by nagendra kumar singh demonetisation has paralysed wholesale markets in the city, be they of grocery  rice, wheat, pulses, spices and suchlike  or fruits. the vegetable wholesale market was also hit in the first two days after the rs 500 and rs 1,000 notes were banned on november 8, but the demand later recovered. marufganj market, the citys biggest wholesale market which on an average day notches up sales of not less than rs 10 crore, is barely doing business worthrs 2.5 crore per day. lalit agrawal, a trader from the marufganj area, said footfall has plummeted by around 75 per cent. the demonetisation has hit business in a big way, agrawal said. it seems like the will to shop has completely vanished. there are no customers in the market. people are coming with rs 500 and rs 1,000 notes, which we are not accepting as it has been scrapped. very few people have smaller denomination notes or the new rs 2,000 notes. we are not accepting rs 500 and rs 1,000 as we have to deposit those with the banks, and going by the crowd at the banks and atms with people lining up for hours its not feasible for us to accept bigger notes. as one travels from market to market, its almost like a chorus  no customers, no money, worries galore. maharajganj market in patna city generally sees daily sales of around rs 2 crore; it is now scraping up just about rs 25-30 lakh. people are not coming, said akhilesh, a trader. there is a drop in customers as well as overallsales. the market is usually overcrowded, but nowadays it is silent. most people now want to meet their basic needs first, and they are saving lower denomination currency notes for emergency situations. patnas biggest wholesale fruits market, bazaar samiti, which generally witnesses huge crowds in the morning, wore a deserted look on wednesday. the market, which used to have daily sales of more than rs 10 lakh, has virtually collapsed. sales at present stand at rs 1-2 lakh only, said haji mohammad min alam, president, patna food merchant association. we accepted rs 500 and rs 1,000 notes in the initial two-three days on humanitarian grounds as people come to us from far-flung areas such as ara, danapur, naubatpur, fatuha. however, we have now stopped accepting the bigger notes and the people are short of lower denomination notes. this has hit the market significantly as people in general are saving the smaller notes for their basic necessities. he added: at times, the situation spirals out of control and there is fear of violence as people insist on paying with rs 500 and rs 1,000 notes as they want to get rid of those. its not just demand; supply to the markets has been hit as well. before demonetisation, if 20 trucks used to come daily from other states like kashmir and maharashtra, the number now has gone down to five or six, saidrazi ahmed, another trader. the reason is that we are not beingable to send money to those states. the sellers problem has been further compounded here as they are unable to recover money from retailers, which in turn has made sending money to other states adifficult task. to ensure the fruits dontrot, traders are sending them tocold stores. we dont have hope that the market transactions will revive this month,"" ahmed added. another problem we are facing is that the transporters and porters working in the market have also refused to accept the invalid currencies as payments. as a result, several trucks from other states are still stationed here. another wholesale fruit dealer wasim said: as fruit markets are cash-oriented markets, scrapping of the bigger notes has brought market activity to a grinding halt. the footfall has fallen by 90 per cent with sales dropping to one-tenth of the usual figures. unlike malls, transactions here take place in cash. when there is not much cash available, how will people shop?

Nearly 22 varieties of vegetables and commodities like linseed, tur dal, rice, golden berry along with vegetables are being sold. ""We have set up two other similar organizations in Gondia and Bhandara,"" says Kale. The farmers have also tied up with various hotels and caterers in the city, so whatever remains after three to four hours of selling is sold in bulk to these commercial establishments, adds Kale.So far, the two markets are held on Sundays at Lendra Park in Ramdaspeth and at Ravi Nagar on Thursdays.

""Being a vegetable grower can be very disheartening,"" says Suresh Bhattad, a farmer with 12 acres of land near Nagpur. ""Inspite of bumper production of tomato, I suffered a total loss as I would sell in wholesale market at Rs2 for a kg. After deducting the cost of transportation, I was getting barely 50 paise on one kg, whereas brokers in the market were pocketing huge amounts,"" says Bhattad, who then made an effort to sell it directly by posting messages on WhatsApp. It's been just 25 days since he started getting his produce to the city, which includes bottle gourd, tomato and brinjals. ""People are happy with what we bring but are now asking for a larger variety,"" says Bhattad.Another group of 400 farmers is also selling their produce through a permanent outlet at Lendra Park, Ramdaspeth. ""The biggest advantage of direct selling is that previously during season time I would sell tomatoes for Rs3 per kg. Today I sell them at Rs20 round the year,"" says Sudhakar Kubde, who has a farm near Kalmeshwar where 17 varieties of vegetables are grown. ""My annual income has doubled from Rs1.5 lakh to Rs3.5 lakh in one year,"" says Kubde.""I was curious after receiving a message for buying farm fresh veggies,"" says Dr Kirti Jaiswal, now a regular customer of these farmers. ""The products were amazingly tasty, fresh and had a longer shelf life.

""The fact that this helps the poor farmer to get a fair deal is enough for me to buy from them,"" adds Sonal Barde, a busy entrepreneur.More than the farmer, it is the consumer who should be taking up this movement, feels Vasant Futane a farmer from Warud.

""inspite of bumper production of tomato, i suffered a total loss as i would sell in wholesale market at rs2 for a kg. after deducting the cost of transportation, i was getting barely 50 paise on one kg, whereas brokers in the market were pocketing huge amounts,"" says bhattad, who then made an effort to sell it directly by posting messages on whatsapp. it's been just 25 days since he started getting his produce to the city, which includes bottle gourd, tomato and brinjals. ""people are happy with what we bring but are now asking for a larger variety,"" says bhattad.another group of 400 farmers is also selling their produce through a permanent outlet at lendra park, ramdaspeth. ""the biggest advantage of direct selling is that previously during season time i would sell tomatoes for rs3 per kg. today i sell them at rs20 round the year,"" says sudhakar kubde, who has a farm near kalmeshwar where 17 varieties of vegetables are grown. ""my annual income has doubled from rs1.5 lakh to rs3.5 lakh in one year,"" says kubde.""i was curious after receiving a message for buying farm fresh veggies,"" says dr kirti jaiswal, now a regular customer of these farmers. ""the products were amazingly tasty, fresh and had a longer shelf life. i was surprised to see how politely they would speak to the customers,"" say jaiswal, who convinced her neighbours at mhada colony near bole petrol pump to also buy from these farmers. ""the fact that this helps the poor farmer to get a fair deal is enough for me to buy from them,"" adds sonal barde, a busy entrepreneur.more than the farmer, it is the consumer who should be taking up this movement, feels vasant futane a farmer from warud. ""the direct markets help in forming a relationship between the farmer and the consumer. this way both get sensitive to each other's needs,"" says futane, who doesn't need to bring his produce to the city as he has a large chain of buyers who contact him directly."

Here is the complete transcript of thewith Arnab Goswami.Prime Minister Modi thank you very much for this interview. Thank you very muchMy greetings to all the peopleThis is your first one to one interview to a private news channel since you became Prime Minister. And if I am not mistaken, this is the first ever interview by a sitting Prime Minister of India to a private television news channel in the country. So I would first like to thank you and am very grateful for the opportunity.The world of the media has grown so big that everybody has to attach themselves with it.I am very grateful and our viewers will be very grateful also Mr Modi because they want to hear your views on a range of subjects. Mr Prime Minister I would like to start by taking you back to 20th May 2014. The results came on May 16th. Four days later, you gave a historic speech in the Central Hall of Parliament and you were speaking to the members of Parliament. You had said four days after the results that an era of responsibility has begun. And that you said that in 2019 before the elections, I will come back to this Parliament, I will come back to the MPs and I will give my report card. Forty percent into your tenure, how much have you achieved of your own targets?When I went for the first time as an MP to the Central Hall, and it was the first time I was seeing the Central Hall. I had not been there before. So I had then said that becoming the Prime Minister was not about the designation of the office but it was about the responsibilities and work of being a PM. I had also said that my government would be committed to the poor. I was completely new in the job. Delhi was new for me. The Delhi environment was new to me. The work of the government of India was also new for me. But despite that, in such a short time, the pace at which the country has moved forward, and it's not on one subject. You can pick up any aspect of the government's functioning, and if you make a comparison with the past governments, then you will realize that no issue has been ignored. There has been an effort to bring in something new in every area. There is an effort to bring in change in every area. One big challenge was that I was not experienced about this place, I had not even been an MP. The office was new, the questions were also new. But when I look at the second biggest challenge, we should remember those days when the country was engulfed in disappointment. The everyday news was about whether there would be any electricity production after seven days, whether coal would be supplied or not. This was the situation then. The entire system was engulfed in disappointment. The big challenge was to inject new trust into the system and create confidence among the citizens. It is very difficult to evaluate this from the outside but I have gone through it. But today I can say with a lot of satisfaction that now there is no trace of any disappointment. The intention to do something is visible. And it's not in words but in actual achievement. I had said that within a given timeframe, we will open bank accounts for the poor. For something that had not been done for 60 years, setting a timeframe for it was in itself a risk. But because of that a trust was created in the system that it was something doable. So that's the process I started for awakening the confidence. And today you can see that in every sector, the changed circumstances can be seen. While evaluating the performance of this government, never forget that you will have to make that evaluation in comparison with the 10 years of the previous government. Only then will you know where we were and where we are now. We should not be talking about what we are aiming for. For now you will have to assess the present in comparison with the immediate past and in that you will find a bright futureMr. Modi, I want to start now on the issue of foreign policy. In the area of foreign policy, you have taken great personal interest. The amount of personal interest you have shown in foreign policy, probably none of the previous Prime Ministers showed the same kind of interest. Your approach is pro active. What I find interesting about your foreign policy is that you have balanced different powers and different interests. On the one side, your relationship with US, you made sure that India enters the Missile Control Technology Regime with them. A week before that you also signed the historic Chabahar Port Agreement with Iran. So, you have balanced very diverse forces. My question to you over this is that, is it easy to do that as an Indian Prime Minister? Secondly, on the issue of the NSG, you staked a lot of personal interest, personal push, you lobbied actively. How close are we to getting the NSG seat?Firstly, about foreign policy, you need to know what has strengthened our foreign policy. For 30 years, in our country, the government was unstable. For 30 years, party with a clear mandate wasn't given the opportunity to form the government. The world measures the government of a nation on the basis of its condition in its own country, on how strong their word is in their own country. I am thankful to the people of this country, that after 30 years, they chose a government with absolute majority and this has had an impact on world politics. Countries and world leaders have changed their perspective towards India. This is the biggest benefit. Secondly, the world didn't know me. The world wants to know who the head of the state is. If someone would want to know Modi through the eyes of the media, then he would be disillusioned on which modi is the real Modi. If this happens, the country will be at a loss. Modi's personality shouldn't be a hindrance for the world to have faith in india. But for that unless I meet all those leaders and engage them them one to one, unless I speak to them frankly, they wouldn't know about india's head of state, so it was very important for me as I am not from a political family. I never had the opportunity to meet the world leaders earlier.You were an unknown entity in foreign policyMore than foreign policy it was foreign relations. Yes, I was new to it. So for me, being pro active was mandatory. Thirdly, we work as a team. Foreign ministry, Prime Minister's officer, commerce ministry, finance ministry, defense minister, everyone works as a team, not as separate pieces. The impact that is now visible, is not just because of Modi, it is because of the team. All teams work in a particular direction. That is why the impact is seen, earlier these teams were splintered. We have seen instances where the party would give a statement, the prime minister would say something else, party leaders would say something else. This disunity has had a negative impact. Thirdly, we also need to understand that earlier the world was bi polar. Foreign policy would be centered around two super powers. India was a little late in realizing that this bi polar situation was for namesake. Now the entire world, in changed circumstances, especially in 21st century, it is more interdependent and inter connected, earlier, the foreign policy was possible between governments, but today it is not possible just between governments. Government relations are important but increasing people to people contact is equally important. There's been a shift in paradigm. Because I do not have any previous baggage, because I've had a clean slate, I write everything from beginning and that has a benefit. Today we are building relations with countries across the world. The amount of respect with which I engage saudi arabia, I engage Iran with the same amount of respect. The amount of respect with which I speak to America, I speak to russia with the same amount of respect. So we need to understand this. We also need to understand that we shouldn't consider smaller countries insignificant. I abide by this principle. The small countries of the world are as important as the big nations. We had assumed that the relations with smaller nations would develop under the shadow of the bigger nations. I brought about a change in this. You must have seen that I made a forum for the pacific island nations. We have had two meetings. I went there once and they came here once. These are small countries with a population of about 10 lakh or 20 lakh. But these small island nations are most affected by global warming. When india took up the international solar mission and 122 nations joined it, the island nations benefitted the most out of it. They are 50 in number now. A group of 50 nations, feels secured with this vision of India. If we try to understand this change, then we would realize that in the world, a few days back, I was sitting with the officers of our foreign services, so as we got talking, in a very poetic way I told them that there was a time when we used to sit by the sea and count the waves, but the time has now changed, we are done counting waves, now it's time for us to steer ourselves, ride the waves and decide on our direction, destination and speedThat is apparent. You have a very aggressive foreign policy. But my second question was, you put so much effort for NSG membership. My question was, how close are we to NSG membership and were you disappointed that we did not make it at the very end because of China's opposition?Look the first thing is that India has been continuously making these efforts, no matter which government was in office. Be it the membership of the UN Security Council or the SCO membership or MTCR membership or NSG membership. Every government has made an effort. It's not that only this government is trying, it's in continuity. But it's during our tenure that we achieved SCO membership, we also got the MTCR membership. I have full faith that now we have begun a coordinated effort for the NSG membership too. The process has begun on a positive note. Everything has rules and will work accordingly and move forwardIs it the problem of mindset with China? There have been 13 engagements at various levels between the Narendra Modi government and the Chinese government. The latest engagement was when you went to Tashkent. You spent some time with the Chinese President Xi Jinping. Yet it was seen that in the case of Masood Azhar, China blocked India's UN bid to ban him. Now they have stalled India's NSG bid. Why is China repeatedly blocking us Mr Prime Minister despite your personal proactive measures and your government's outreach?The first thing is that we have an ongoing dialogue with China and it should continue to happen. In foreign policy it's not necessary to have similar views to have a conversation. Even when the views are contradictory, talks are the only way forward and problems should be resolved through dialogue. We don't have one problem with China, we have a whole lot of problems pending with China. Slowly and steadily, an effort is on to address these issues through talks and make them less cumbersome. I can say that China has been cooperating with India to search for solutions. On some issues, it's a question of principles for them. On some issues, it's a question of principles for us. On some issues they differ with us and there are issues on which we differ with them. There are some basic differences. But the most important thing is that we can speak to China eye-to-eye and put forth India's interests in the most unambiguous manner. We are a government that takes care of India's interests. We don't compromise on this. Three days ago I met the Chinese President. I told him clearly about India's interests. They are a different country, we are a different countryDo you think you will be able to change their mindset on the issue of NSG membership?See the foreign policy is not about changing mindsets. Foreign policy is about finding the common meeting points. Where do our interests converge and how much? We have to sit and talk with every country. It's our ongoing effortThis statement that you just made is also apt in the context of America where you gave a speech in the U.S Congress. By the way Mr Prime Minister it was a fantastic speechThank youThere was a lot of humour. You were laughing and cracking jokes while you delivered the speech which was very unique. They also appreciated it. Was the speech impromptu?I have a humourous side but these days humour can be a risky thingWhy do you say that?In this era of 24/7 news channels, anybody can lift a small word and make a big issue out of it. But I will tell you the truth, the reason for the absence of humour in public life is this fear. I am myself scared . Earlier when I used to make speeches, I would make it so humourous but there would never be any issuesHave you become more conscious now?I am not conscious. I am in fear, there is no humour left in public life because of this fear. Everyone is scared. I am in fear. My speeches used be humourous. I see it in Parliament, that humour is finished there too. It is a matter of concern. I will quote one proverb.Yes, go ahead.Even if you mention a proverb, they will connect it with something else and begin a conversation. The one who is saying the proverb does not know for what he is speaking.But you should not lose your sense of humour Mr Prime MinisterBut it is true that my trip to the United States of America, my speech in their Congress and the respect shown towards India created a lot of hype. Had it not been hyped so much, there would not have been so much criticism on the NSG issue. Government is being criticized not for any mishandling of the NSG issue but because we were so successful over there (in the USA)Did China become conscious of your growing friendship with US?I am talking about what's happening hereBut when you delivered that speech in context of America, you used a very interesting phrase. You said 'We have to overcome the hesitations of history'. My Hindi is not that good. Like hesitations of history. But my question to you is Mr Prime Minister, how close can we get to America because many Indians believe that America is still supporting Pakistan, giving them military assistance. How close can we get? At what point do we stop before we are seen like an American ally? What is your own world view on that?I would especially like to appeal to my country's media that we should stop looking at everything in India from the. India is an independent country. It is a country of 125 crore people. Whenever it approaches any country, it will only be concerned about its own interests. It has been our biggest shortcoming and mistake that we have been tagging ourselves with another country and trying to do things. We are an independent country, we have our own policies and future. We have to think about the future of our 125 crore people. There should be no compromise on our interests. We have relations with America in the context of these fundamental pointsHow close can we get to them?There has been warmth in our relationship. You must have seen the editorials in American newspapers after my visit to that country. One point mentioned in those editorials was that the success of Obama's foreign policy has been the warm relationship with India. This has been saidWhat you are saying Modiji is that we can be close to America but we need not be an ally or seen to be an ally?The first thing is that we no longer live in a bipolar world. The world is interconnected and interdependent. You will have to connect with everybody at the same time. Even if there are two opposing countries, they will have to be friends. Now the times have changedMr Modi, on 8th May 2014, I had the opportunity to interview you, the interview took place in Ahmedabad, I think one last phase of elections was left. We were discussing the issue of Pakistan. You have had an uncompromising approach towards Pakistan. Two days back, Lashkar E Toiba killed 8 CRPF jawans in an attack. In the 8th May interview, you put forth a very interesting phrase, you said 'Can talks be heard amidst the noise of bombs, guns and pistols?' This is how you had phrased it. Do you believe we have been too generous towards Pakistan? Do you believe we have been too generous towards Pakistan?There are two things. One - India has always wanted friendly ties with its neighbours, there can be no debate around it. We want to live in harmony and peace. And I have said it repeatedly, that India has to fight poverty, Pakistan too has to fight poverty, why don't we come together to fight poverty? I said this before elections and during election campaigns. Also I had invited leaders of SAARC nations to my swearing in ceremony and they had attended it as well. So there has been no change in our intent, our thoughts and our current behaviour. Number two - those who have to work from the table, will work from the table and those who have to work at the border, will work at border with full strength. Each one will fulfill the responsibility entrusted to them. And our jawans are fulfilling their responsibilities. It's true that pressure on terrorists has increased, their schemes are proving unsuccessful. The intent with which they move forward are foiled and they have to face major challenges. It is because of this disappointment that such incidents are taking place and our jawans are risking their lives and protecting the country. We are very proud of our JawansWhen your foreign policy is studied, observers analyze what's happening and what's not happening. If you give me the opportunity, I want to do a bit of analyses. There was a terrific pace of engagement with Pakistan between October, November and December. On 30th November, you met Nawaz Sharif on the sidelines (of UN Climate Summit in Paris). Both of you were seated on a sofa, talking to each other. A lot of people were speculating the contents of your conversation. This was on the sidelines of Climate Summit. After that, all of a sudden within seven days there were NSA level talks and Ajit Doval spoke to Nasir Janjua in Bangkok. And again after that you went to Russia via Afghanistan, you made an unexpected visit to Nawaz Sharif in Lahore. It was a personal trip but it still had some level of importance. Eight days later, Pakistani terrorists attacked Pathankot. Can you tell our viewers whether Pakistan was proactively responding in the months of October, November and December? Did the Pathankot terror attack change the situation? Is it true that Pakistan was making a lot of movement in those three months?Look there are different types of forces operating in Pakistan. But the government only engages with a democratically elected system. Our effort for that engagement is continuing. But our supreme objective is peace. Our supreme objective is to protect India's interests. We keep making effort toward that objective and sometimes our efforts are successful. As far as meetings and talks are concerned, we signalled right from the day I took oath and sent invitations for the oath taking ceremony, that we seek friendly relations but without compromising on our interests. And that is why I have said that my country's soldiers have full freedom to answer back in whatever manner they have to and they will keep doing thatMr Prime Minister what is the 'Lakshman Rekha' that you would draw when it comes to Pakistan. There is some confusion surrounding this subject. I would like you to give an elaborate reply. In 2014, it was believed that if talks are being held, then they should be held between two countries and not with Hurriyat. It should be between the government of India and the government of Pakistan. The other 'Lakshman Rekha' is that you must act on 26/11. There's been no forward movement so far. The third thing is about forward movement on the Pathankot attack case. So what is the 'Lakshman Rekha' now and if Pakistan remains within those bounds, so talks can happen at the political level or at any other level?The first thing is that with Pakistan, to whom do we talk to decide about the 'Lakshman Rekha'. Will it be with the elected government or with other actors? That is why India will have to be on alert all the time. India will have to be alert every moment. There can never be any laxity in this. But there is an outcome due to my continuous efforts like my visit to Lahore and my invitation to the Pakistani Prime Minister to come to India. Now I don't have to explain to the world about India's position. The world is unanimously appreciating India's position. And the world is seeing that Pakistan is finding it difficult to respond. If we had become an obstacle, then we would have had to explain to the world that we are not that obstacle. Now we don't have to explain to the world. The world knows our intentions. Like on the issue of terrorism, the world never bought India's theory on terrorism. They would sometime dismiss it by saying that it's your law and order problem. Today the world has to accept what India has been saying about terrorism. India's dialogue on terrorism, the losses India has suffered due to terrorism, the losses suffered by humanity, the world is now acknowledging that. So I believe we have to take this process forwardMr Prime Minister I now want to move to questions on the economy. In the past two years you have started many schemes. If we look at the theme of Jan Dhan Yojna for financial inclusion, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna for crop insurance, Swach Bharat, Skill India, Make In India. If we see the theme running through these schemes, is your social agenda at the core of your personal economic philosophy, social transformation? Is the social agenda at the core of your economic philosophy as the Prime Minister?The first point is our philosophy is to reach the last man in the line. Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay's philosophy forms the core of our political, economic and social ideology. And even Mahatma Gandhi used to say that what is there for the last man? So my development parameter is very simple. It is about how the poorest of the poor can benefit from development. The poor is the central focus of my economic agenda. The poor should be strengthened in such a way that they get the willingness to defeat poverty. By helping the poor make ends meet while they remain in poverty is also one of the ways. I am not saying right or wrong but it's one of the ways. But today the country's situation is such that we should make the poor strong so that they become partners in defeating poverty. All these schemes are meant to empower the poor and change the quality of life. The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna is not only about opening bank accounts for the poor. Because of this the poor are feeling that they are becoming a part of the country's economic system. The bank that he was seeing from afar, now he is able to enter that bank. This brings about a psychological transformation. Looked at in another way, did you ever imagine that 40 thousand crores could be injected into the banking system by contributions from the poor. The poor who never had bank accounts, have deposited 100 rupees, 50 rupees or 200 rupees. It means that poor man saved 100 rupees and the change began in his life. We have taken up construction of toilets. I had gone to Chhattisgarh and had the opportunity to get the blessings of one mother. An adivasi mother heard about the scheme for building toilets. She sold her four goats and built a toilet. That 90 old mother uses a walking stick and goes around the cluster of 30 or 40 houses in the tribal village and has been spreading the message to build toilets. This change is becoming the reason for the change in the quality of life. I have begun the cleanliness campaign. It's estimated an individual spends an average of 7000 rupees for treatment of a disease. The main reason for disease is filth. The poor suffer the most from the filth. If a poor man falls sick, he cannot drive his rickshaw for two days and his children go hungry. So how can we help the poor bring about change in their lives? Now there is a neo-middle class and a middle class in the country. The young have their aspirations. So another aspect of my policies you must have seen are the Start Up India, Stand Up India, Seaport activity, port activity, railways expansion, railway station upgradation. These changes directly appeal to the middle class. The middle class has its aspirations. We have to create jobs? How will job creation happen? Till I invest in the development of infrastructure, there be no job creation. You must have seen that the maximum electricity generation since Independence has occurred this year. The maximum amount of coal mined has been in this year. The maximum length of roads being constructed daily is happening in this year. The fastest loading and unloading of steamers at sea ports is happening now. All these changes are creating opportunities for employment like in Start up India, Stand Up India. For instance in Stand Up India, I have said that every bank should give an economic opportunity to one woman, one dalit or one tribal person to become entrepreneurs. This will create many job opportunities. So this is the basis of my economic philosophy.Mr Prime Minister if I could interrupt you on this. On the one hand is the people's expectations and on the other is your vision. Many programs that you have mentioned, you can't put a calendar date to it but they don't have an immediate impact. They maybe able to show results in 3, 4, 5 maybe beyond 5 years. Now there are challenges in that. Mr Prime Minister, you are aware more than anyone else that people want immediate results. Now you spoke of job creation. The first thing, as an achievement you have managed to grow the economy at 7.5 per cent when the global economic climate is very bleak. You have spoken about it as well. You have met fiscal deficit targets, FDI inflows have increased but people are saying that job opportunities are not increasing. You have spoken about infrastructure but the current rate of unemployment. Mr Prime Minister, the latest Labour Bureau figures, is it a source of concern for you as the Prime Minister?The first thing is that are 800 million people below the age of 35 in our country. We have to accept that the demand for jobs is very high. But where will they get employment? Investment will come in. It will be used in the infrastructure sector, manufacturing and services sector. Now like the initiative we have taken, we have started the Mudra Yojna. More than three crore people in the country comprise washermen, barbers, milkman, newspaper vendors, cart vendors. We have given them nearly 1.25 lakh crore rupees without any guarantee. Now why have these people taken the money? To expand their work. When he expands his work, if he is currently employing one person, now he has to employ two people. If there were two employed earlier, now there are three. Now just think, when 3 crore of these small businesses have got access to finance, they must have expanded their work. Now all this is not in the Labour Department's registration. Three crore people have expanded their work. We took another small decision. The big malls in the country run 365 days a year but the smaller shops have to close on holidays. We announced in the Budget that even a small shopkeeper can operate his shop till late night and that too on all the seven days of the week. If the malls don't have restrictions then why should the small shopkeepers have restrictions. So now if a shopkeeper operates his shop till late and on all seven days, if he earlier employed one person, now he will have to employ two people. So won't the employment increase?So is your focus on entrepreneurship?Our focus is on all aspects. Now we are saying that by 2022 we want to ensure that everyone has a house. Housing sector has the maximum potential for creating employment. Houses will be built in such huge numbers, how many people will get employment? You must have seen that last year we brought in a textile policy. Under this textile policy, there will be income tax benefits for those who create employment. The more employment one creates, the more tax benefits they will get. For the first time, employment generation and tax has been linked. These are the things that boost employment and our central focus is creating employment for the ordinary citizenMr Prime Minister, questions are also being raised on food inflation which has still not decreased. The expectation was that the food inflation would decline. The people had put their hopes on the Prime Minister that you will bring down prices. This not only has a political impact but also has a social impact. Over the past two weeks, there were reports that in some places the price of Arhar dal had touched 150 rupees and 200 rupees for other pulses. The price of tomatoes was also rising. Is this only seasonal because the food inflation is increasing at 7.5 per cent year on year. Global oil prices have fallen. Do you think this creates perception issues for your government?You can't view inflation as a perception issue. Price rise should be seen as a reality. What is available for a consumer should be seen for what it is. There should never be an attempt to view price rise as a perception issue as a means of escaping the reality of price rise. We will have to accept reality. You see the fast pace at which prices were rising under the previous government, today that speed has decelerated a lot. You can see the statistics, you will find it there. Second, the country has gone through two consecutive years of severe drought. Drought has a direct impact on the price of vegetables, food and pulses because all these things are produced from the soil. Now when there is such a big drought, it's not in anybody's hands. The second option in such a situation is imports. The Indian government has imported pulses in huge quantities. Third, it is the joint responsibility of the state and Central governments. It is not exclusively the state's responsibility. It is not exclusively the Centre's responsibility. It is the joint responsibility of both the state and Central governments. This should not be an issue of blame game that the state government did not do certain things and that the Centre did not do certain things. But it will have to be agreed that it is the joint responsibility of both. That is why the Centre has given rights to the states to make stringent laws. How much stocks to keep or not to keep are decisions which the states can take. All these rights have been given to the states. Some states have performed well, some states are trying. But the Centre and state governments are trying to work together on this. I believe that we have been successful to the extent that the speed with which prices were rising (under UPA), what would have happened if the prices were to rise at that speed. We have been successful in stopping that speedy rise of prices. But as far as pulses are concerned, production in India has been very low. Many farmers who were earlier sowing pulses have started cultivating sugar. That is also an area of concern. We gave special incentives for pulses. We have tried to set up a different MSP for pulses. We have taken steps to procure pulses from farmers with bonus. Our focus is on increasing the production of pulses. We are also focusing on building stocks of pulses by importing from abroad. An all out effort is being made and I believe that nobody doubts the sincerity of this governmentMr Prime Minister what is your view about the controversy around the exit of Raghuram Rajan as the RBI Governor? A lot has been spoken about this. There was commentary that it may effect India's image, perception as a global economy. What's your own view of the controversy around the exit of Raghuram Rajan?When my Government was formed in May 2014, you take newspapers from May, June, July 2014 and check television debates during that period. The topic of the television debates would be - Will the new govt let Raghuram Rajan continue? Or Will the new Government oust Raghuram Rajan? And there was more or less consensus that he was appointed by the previous govt and so Modi won't let him complete his tenure and will remove him. You have seen, that he worked his entire tenure. For the time he was appointed by the previous government, he completing his entire term. So all the misconceptions have been dispelled. Secondly, according to my 2 year experience in Govt, those who are creating controversies, are being unjust to Raghuram RajanWhy so?I will tell you. Those who say...I believe Raghuram Rajan's patriotism is no less than any of ours. It will be doing injustice to him if one says that he will serve the country only if he is at a particular post. As much as I know Raghuram Rajan, whatever post he holds, wherever he is, he is someone who will continue to serve the country. He is someone who loves his country. Therefore, it's not like the nation won't get Raghuram Rajan's services, Raghuram Rajan is not that kind of a person. He is a person who loves the country. Those who speak such language are doing great injustice to him. My experience with him has been good.I appreciate the work he has done. And my good wishes will always be with himPrime Minister Modi, there's a question related to this. During your speech at the Executive you used seven words begining with letter 'S'-- 'Sevabhaav' (service), 'Santulan' (balance), 'Sanyam' (restraint), 'Samvaad' (dialogue), 'Samanvay' (coordination), 'Sakaratmak' (positivity) and 'Samvedna' (sensitivity). I will ask the question in context with Raghuram Rajan because you used these words in the speech at National Executive Meet speech on June 14 in Allahabad. You said, 'Our party leaders and party workers should use these qualities in their daily dealings and behaviour.' Prime Minister, in Raghuram Rajan's context, your Rajya Sabha MP has made many comments. Later he made critical remarks against senior bureaucrats. My question is, do you think it is right? When we talk about 'Sanyam' (restraint) and 'Santulan' (balance), is it correct?Whether it is someone from my party or not, I believe that such things are inappropriate. The nation won't benefit from such publicity stunts. One should be more responsible while conducting themselves. Anyone who believes he is bigger than the system is wrong.That's a very clear message.I have a very clear message. I have no two minds about it.And Mr Prime Minister, if I may say so, between May 8 and now, you are speaking as straight as you did before you took over as Prime Minister. I think that answer takes me to the next subject. Mr Prime Minister, the issue is that of Black Money. In a very interersting way you said, prices should not be looked at from the point of percepetion, equally, Mr Prime Minister it can be said said that an issue like Black Money should not be looked at in terms of perception, but it is perception forming. There are political debates on this. Experts say that the Black Money economy has shrunk, 10-15% economy has shrunk through land dealings and other things. You have passed the Black Money Bill, you have made taxation more transparent, you have started information sharing with other countries, you have taken steps, but Prime Minister Modi, people still expect that a Rs 25 lakh crores will be brought back and put into their bank accounts. How will you address that expectation? The hope that people have taking Black Money, how will you address it?How did the black money issue arise and how did it become such a serious issue? We have to look at the background. It is an established fact in the minds of the common man those who steal money park their money overseas. It's a common perception. Even if I look at it from the common man's perspective, I also wonder where does this money go? This issue was always stalled in the Parliament. When the matter reached the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court ordered Special Investigation Team to look into it, even then the previous government stalled it for three years, from 2011-2014. It's after this that political parties, the media and the common man started believing that there's something wrong. Then the issue of Black Money became an agenda. Even today I can say...that yes, when there is money stashed in foreign accounts, there are some norms of engagement with foreign countries on the issue. But between 2011-2014, these people were given the opportunity to launder money here and thereAnd you also said on 17 February 2015 on this issue, that the then Law Minister is only offering lip serviceThe result was that people got several chances to launder money. Secondly, after our Government was formed, the first decision taken by our Cabinet was to form a Special Investigation Team to bring back Black Money which was pending despite Supreme Court's 2011 order. This shows our sincerity. From then on, you can't imagine how stringent the laws have been made to bring back Black Money and whoever comes in its fold will know how strict the law is. Thirdly, I attended the G20 Summit. Never was Black Money issue discussed in the G20 forum. It was my first G20 summit, for the first time I met the world leaders. And for the first time in the G20 Summit, one paragraph was on unaccounted money, on black money and 20 countries said that the world should cooperateBlack. The dirty money, black money was also linked to terrorism, an environment of global census was created. We have been signing agreements one after the other with different countries that there will be real time, automatic exchange of information with India. I recently visited Switzerland and there was minimal discussion on the issue. But after I returned, a big delegation from Switzerland visited India, and they held meeting with the Indian Government and we discussed...for several years, we believed that Switzerland is the place where black money is stashed, that country is holding discussions to come to a consensus on Automatic Information Exchange and if we reach consensus it will be a great achievement. Thirdly you must've seen that Mauritius route came up in almost everything. It was said that money goes out of India and returns through the Mauritius route. This was discussed. Everyone thought that nothing can be done about the Mauritius route.But our Government held a dialogue with the Mauritius Government, made changes to the old treaty. And we successfully made a new treaty to block the money which comes through the Mauritius route and very soon it will be phased out and completed. All these decisions are taken to fight the Black Money menace. This is not a one sided fight. Secondly, the govt is working in a direction to make sure that Black Money isn't generated in India and black Money doesn't go out of India, you can see the results of all this.When the opposition raises the Rs 15 lakh issue.That is something the opposition raises during elections. Let them have some issue to talk aboutMr Prime Minister, there has been no major financial corruption or scam in your tenure in the last two years. Perception is again, what people say is because you keep a very tight control on the reins of Government but the question is there are people, who are wilful defaulters, the economic offenders who take a lot of money from the country or commit economic offences in the country, go overseas and use rules and use lawyers, and they don't come back to India. And people are asking now, is the Narendra Modi Govt determined to take these cases of wilful defaulters and economic offenders to their logical conclusion.Firstly, this question is not in the minds of people. The people of India have confidence that if there's someone who can do this, it is Narendra Modi and he will do it. Citizens of the country have full faith.Does it worry you, that people have misued the law?I take this as an opportunity and I will show them what the law is.Mr. Modi, there have been several corruption cases about the previous government, which have now come out. There is AgustaWestland, many defense scams and defense transactions are now being analyzed seriously. The cases which were quoted in the CAG reports but were ignored are now coming in the forefront. This question is important because this isn't just about financial corruption but these questions have direct implications on the national security of the country. Do you think, when they say that this is a political witch hunt by Narendra Modi Sarkar, do you think all of these cases would have been possible without political patronage?There are many things which are not visible. One can't imagine the difficulty I am experiencing in taking out things from dirt. One who is working there knows the amount of dirt that exists and how certain things have been caught in a web. There are certain powers behind it. The case about Agusta helicopters. I can't deny it and I believe that we have the right to doubt that people behind this are very experienced. They have perfectly practiced the art of doing wrong deeds. They are very experienced and knowledgeable. And one can also smell the fact that such a thing wouldn't have been done without a shield. Now, agencies are probing. Let's see how far the probe goes. But the investigation shouldn't go ahead while people are being targeted, neither does my government target anyone. The sin has been committed, but how much is done, How was it done, who did it, probe agencies will find out in a professional way. Whatever comes out, will be put outPrime Minister, talking about your speech in the US Congress, and the humour that you displayed. I felt some of it was impromptu. But the Americans were able to relate to what you said, I don't remember the exact words, you said, I am informed that the working of the US Congress is harmonious. And then there was a pause and people were laughing. Then you said, 'I am told' - You emphasized and said 'I am told that you are well known for your bipartisanship.' Then the applause was more. And then you said, 'You are not alone. Time and again I have witnessed a similar spirit in the Indian Parliament.' You spoke about a serious topic in a interesting manner. You referred to the Upper House. There was a lot of response on that too. Your humour was really appreciated and I think it was a wonderful moment when you were speaking. But, Mr. Prime Minister, when you look back at the parliament, this question comes to many people's minds, has Prime Minister Narendra Modi being held back from achieving his own objectives because of the non-stop parliamentary logjam. How much has this affected his moving towards his own targets? If you critically analyze this situation, do you feel your government could have been more consultative or do you feel the blame is entirely with the Opposition?I look at it differently. I believe there have been a lot of problems. Whether the fault is ours or their's, I 'll leave it to the people. People will decide. But because of discussions in Parliament - we may not come to a decision, the decision could be opposing our view, nothing wrong in that. But at least there should be a discussion. The sad part is, if somebody is running away from debate or don't let discussions happen, then it is a cause of worry in a democracy. Whether the government's work is accomplished or not, I don't see it as a cause of worry. If not today, it will happen tomorrow. There are certain things which will happen at an administrative level. The big thing is, Parliament is for discussion. Parliament is to show dissent. Parliament is to give an argument for one's opposition, to present an argument when they support.To uphold this basic spirit of Parliament, is the responsibility of every person who values democracy. It is the responsibility of those present in the Parliament and those outside. It is the responsibility of those in power and those not in power. This is a matter of spirit and it should be followed. As far as the government is concerned, on every issue and at every forum, we have tried to hold discussions. I myself have met the opposition leaders and spoken to them. Key members of the government are also in touch. And you must have seen that many issues have been resolved. In the last session, we have passed 12 bills in Rajya Sabha, we passed 10 bills in the Lok Sabha. So the pace has picked up. When people say 'Opposition', it is unfair to the opposition. There are some parties in the Parliament which are not with the BJP or NDA, but are with the government on key decisions. So, to defame the Opposition by saying that all opposition parties are against us -- when some people do this, it is wrong. There is one party which has problems. And the whole world knows that party. Secondly, to say that 'When you were is Opposition, you did it this way' There is a difference between every Opposition party. 'We have run the government for 60 years and now we are in the Opposition, so we know the nitty-gritties of the government, we know the responsibilities. We can't behave in the way, a new Opposition party behaves.' A party which hasn't been in power or hasn't seen anything, could behave in this way. For example, we are in power now, and consider in 2040 we become the Opposition party. So, in 2040 we can't have the same conduct as the one we had in 2009 or 2010.Congress is a very experienced and old partyThat's why I say that, those who have been in power for so many years, shouldn't be doing this. If there is a new party in the Opposition, they have a small demand for their state or if an MP has a demand for his/her constituency and does something like this, then we can understand. Ones who have been in power for very long, shouldn't be doing such thingsPrime Minister Modi, do you think the GST bill which has been stuck for over one and half years, it is a path-breaking economic reform. It unifies the country. Recently you met Ms Jayalalithaa after she was sworn in as the Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee has extended her support for GST and Congress allies at the state level are supporting the GST bill. Do you feel optimistic that GST bill will be passed in the next session of the Parliament?First we need to understand, that we look at GST only within the purview of an economic reform because of which the right information doesn't come out. Not having GST straight away means loss for the poor of Uttar Pradesh. Absence of GST straight away means loss for the poor people of Bihar. Not passing the GST would mean loss for the poor people of poor states like Bengal, Orissa and Assam. People who sit in the Rajya Sabha must understand this. GST is beneficial for the poor people of the states represented by them, because those states will economically benefit the most from GST. The money will be used for the welfare of the poor people of those states. This is why be it Mamata Banerjee, be it Nitish Kumar, be it Akhilesh Yadav or Naveen Patnaik, all these states want the GST bill to be passed at the earliest. There is just one group which has made it the issue of prestige. Now the kind of arithmetic which is working out, I hope that this decision is passed in favour of the poor. You will be surprised to what extent has the opposition reached to the level of distortion. In the previous session we introduced an act. Indian government has Rs 40,000 crore rupees from the CAMPA Fund. Rs 40,000 crore. we wanted to give that money to the states. States have to use that money for forestry, for greenery, for planting trees and plants. The bill is meant for that. Had this Rs 40,000 crore reached the states before the monsoons, it would have been used for the forests. A lot of people would have got employment, people who plant trees would have been employed. There would be plantation and due to the rains the plants would start growing within a year. But just because of obstructionism, states have been deprived of the benefit of Rs 40,000 crore. The money was meant for the forests and for the tribals. They blocked it. There was no argument on itThe reason...you had triedMade all efforts.You had invited former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi here at the Race Course RoadWe held talks at every levelStill? The word you used 'ego issue', why has it become an ego issue? And people would want to know why is the Prime Minister unable to end this?The Prime Minister cannot answer this question. Those creating obstructions can only answer this question. But despite this, I will keep trying. I am ready to convince them in which ever way possible. If I have to convoke someone over a cup of tea at their house, I am even ready for that. I have no problem. My only aim is the welfare of the poor of my country and the poor of states like Uttar Pradesh.You spoke of Uttar Pradesh. Mr Prime Minister, elections will be held in Uttar Pradesh in 6,7,8 months. The focus of entire nation will be on it. You are the MP from Varanasi. But some comments are made by BJP, some say Sangh Parivar, some independent groups, communal colour is added to it and not just from one party but from other parties as well. Mr Prime Minister are you going to be able to keep development as the sole agenda? The main issue in the Uttar Pradesh polls should be that of development, it shouldn't get capsized, the focus shouldn't be elsewhere. Are you confident that communal agenda will not overpower development?It's my conviction, it's my commitment. You must have seen during the 2014 elections that I fought elections on the issue of development. The new generation of the country only believes in development. I believe that solution to all problems is in development. Development is also the solution to the tension that people talk about. If we provide employment to people, if we ensure there's food on their plates, if we provide them with facilities and give them education, all the tension will end. And this is why, all those who want good for the nation, I request them to compete towards development and for development. This atmosphere should be created in the country and I think such an environment is being created nowadays.So the hot heads who make extreme comments, is there a necessity to control them? So that there is no politics in the name of religionFirstly, I am of the firm belief that the nation should progress on the issue of development. And it is necessary that the country moves forward on the issue of development. I would like to tell the media not to make heroes out of those people who make such comments.But they keep making such commentsDon't make them heroes, they will stopWe don't make them heroes, we make them villains.But why do you make them so big? I see such statements by people on TV, whose faces I haven't even seen and they end up becoming spokesmen on TVSelf styled spokesmenI don't know why such people are encouragedMr Prime Minister, let's talk in 2016 of the 2017 elections. After Delhi, then Bihar, then Assam, West Bengal. After that we will talk about Punjab. Before we finish talking about Punjab, we will talk about Uttar Pradesh. Then there is the Gujarat state election. Don't you think that this country is permanently stuck in an electoral cycle? The focus constantly and I want you to reflect on this issue, the focus is on party politics, polarising issues, not on governance. We are a country, if we say, we are constantly in a political campaign mode. Is this a good thing? Should we break away from it? And what is your view on it?See this is not an issue about Narendra Modi or the Prime Minister. And also it is not an issue about a particular party or a particular Government.But before the last Parliament session, the Speaker had called all the parties for a meal. After the agenda meeting everyone was sitting to eat. I had also reached at the same time. While talking casually over food, almost people from all parties said that the central and state elections must be held together. Everyone said it. After that during the farewell function of the Rajya Sabha MPs, people from different parties were talking with each other. One of the leaders said, Modiji do anything but get us out of this cycle of electionsWas that leader from your party?No, he was not from my party. So I said that discussion should happen. What is wrong in that? Then one day I said that this was being talked about. This issue has also been discussed in a Parliamentary committee. This work has also been started by the Election Commission and I think they have also writen a letter on it. Like in the fight against black money, this issue of elections also gets connected to black money. Electoral reforms are necessary if the country has to be rid of black money. It is one of the areas for electoral reforms. I believe that the Prime Minister cannot take a decision on this and nor should he do that. Neither the government can do this. There should be a broad discussion on this and we should not run away from the debate on this continious cycle of elections. The Indian voter today is very mature. He votes in one fashion in the Lok Sabha elections, he votes in a different manner in the State Assembly elections. We have seen this. In 2014, the General Elections conincided with the Odisha Assembly elections. The same electorate gave one judgement for Odisha and another judgement for Delhi. So this country's voter is very mature and we should trust his maturity. There should be a debate on how costs can be reduced by holding simultaneous elections, how the influence of black money can be curbed, how the five years can be spent in taking the country forward. Today due to the model code of conduct, there is a loss even in those areas where the code is not applicable. When I was in Gujarat, I found that at least 80 to 90 officers were spending two to three months on election duties in other states. This could be happening in every state. So this is an area of concern and some time or the other this question will have to be thought of. I would want the Election Commission to take this debate forward. They should invite all political parties and hold discussions with everybody and whatever comes out of itCan there be a timebound resolution in this?The Election Commission will have to invite all political parties to discuss this. The process will get derailed if one party were to initiate thisAre you willing to take the lead in building that consensus?Despite being the Prime Minister, I still belong to a political party. The better thing would be for the Election Commission to initiate this. Today the Election Commission is a very prestigious institution in our country. Every political party believes in the Election Commission and it will further empower this institution and that will be betterI think it is an interesting idea of simultaneous elections. Though state parties, regional parties may feel that it will effect them badly. That the national parties like the BJP will gainOdisha is the best example. Odisha is the best example. In 2014, the BJP had no advantage in the state but the BJP won on the Lok Sabha seats. This shows the differenceMr Prime Minister how are you keeping your schedule nowadays? I mean you keep a terrifying pace. The number of meetings you hold, people say your officers find it hard to keep upIt is not so, it has been 2 years now and everyone is used to the work. I believe that it is such a big country that one must do as much work as possible. So I keep doing thatBefore I come to my last question Mr Prime Minister, one issue that I want to come to is the farmers' crisis. As you are well aware, there has been a crisis in this country, you referred to it. In that speech to your MPs, about which I asked you earlier as well, on 20th May in the Central Hall of Parliament you said that 'this government is not for myself, this government is for the poor, we must do something for them.' The farmers' crisis Mr Prime Minster is a reality. I am glad that in this interview you have not avoided the reality, you've faced it, you've talked about it. We have linked our entire future to the monsoons. How do we overcome this from becoming an annual crisis in this country?We will have to put stress on water management here. You must have seen that under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayi Yojana, we have put stress on water issues. During these drought days, I met leaders from 11 states separately and sat with them for about 2-3 hours each. The country would have believed that their Prime Minister is working even if I had held a meeting with 11 of them together for around 10 minutes. But I didn't do that. I sat with leaders from different states separately to understand specific problems and what we could do for water in those states. I am happy, whichever party the state government affiliated to, all the governments focused a lot on water issues this summer. We will reap its benefits this monsoon. Using scientific methods for water accumulation and irrigation, collecting water and directing them towards the fields, everyone did that. Micro irrigation is stressed upon. Even for sugarcane farming, farmers are slowly moving towards micro irrigation which earlier happened through flood irrigation. Paddy crops for which large amount of water is used. Today, farmers have started using drip irrigation for it. If we do well in water facilities, then one of the problems is solved. After independence, for the first time, we have brought in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana which can cover maximum number of farmers. The farmer will have to pay only 2%, only 2%, the government will take care of the rest. The farmers will get an assurance. For instance, in Maharashtra, the monsoons are expected in the month of June, the farmers have prepared for everything but haven't started with the sowing process. Now if there are no rains till August, so practically his crops have not been damaged, because he did not sow the seeds. But the Pradhan Mantri fasal Beema Yojana even takes this into consideration and benefits the farmer. Another important aspect, once the crops are harvested, they're cut and kept in the field, assuming it has been a good year for crop growth, with 100% crop production, but it hasn't been loaded on trucks and sent to the market yet. And if it rains, even after 15 days of harvesting, if there is loss, it is covered under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana. Second layer of protection, minimum premium with maximum cover. After independence, for the first time, we have brought in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana. Thirdly, first time we have brought in E-Mandi concept. Farmer in the village, can sell the crops to the best markets in the country through his mobile phone. Farmer would set the price at which the crop would be sold. Earlier, farmers used to take the produce on carts or tractors, used to go to a mandi 20-25kms away, then due to storage issues, even if they had to sell for Rs 10 less than the price, they used to sell it. Now, sitting at home the farmer would know what price to sell the crops at. Next point is about, food processing, value addition. We opened up 100% foreign direct investment in food processing. For example, if a farmer is selling tomatoes and if a company is processing tomato ketchup then my farmers would benefit from it. The companies that make aerated drinks, Coca-Cola, Pepsi etc, I requested them to add 5% natural fruit juice. In regions near Nagpur and Vidarbha where oranges are cultivated, Coca-Cola is going to add 5% of orange juice. If we add 5% natural juice to aerated water, farmers would get their market and their fruits wouldn't go waste. We should have a comprehensive all-out scheme. So much of our land has been damaged. We have brought in Soil Health Card. We have a Soil Health Abhiyan. The farmer will know the feritility of the land through it. Whether a fertilizer needs to be used or not, the farmer will understand. On an average, a farmer with 1 hectare of land will be able to save Rs 15000-20000. So we have brought in scientific methods. You would know that in our country, farmers used to be lathicharged when they would go to buy urea and they had to buy it in black. We got urea 100% neem coated. Earlier, urea used to go to chemical factories, and the government subsidies were stolen in the name of farmers. After neem coating, urea cannot be used for any other purpose except farming. Because of neem coating, there is a qualitative change which helps in healing the damaged land. Due to neem coating a piece of land that used 10 kgs of urea can now manage with 7 kgs of urea. All these initiatives are in the direction of agriculture and the results will be seen soon.Do you think that the farmers' crisis will be resolved, the question I asked, that it won't be an annual affair, the dependence on monsoons will go down?See agriculture is a state subject. The Indian government has taken initiatives, if the state government are enthusiastic to implement this, which I think they will be. As I told you I met leaders from different states and they worked a lot for water issues. If this works, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana has direct involvement of the central government, it will have great benefits.Mr Prime Minister now I have two questions for you.This has become too long.I'll club these two (questions) together. You're also enjoying it and I am glad you're speaking Mr Prime Minister because there is so much ground to cover and I think viewers would like to hear your view, sir. Actually there are three, if you allow me. They're short questions. First is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, how much is politics playing on your mind? In the sense that every Prime Minister, especially someone who is as forthright as you, looks at the next big challenge. Is 2019 anywhere in your mind?Those who have seen me in Gujarat, and those who have seen me in the last two years, those who see me without any bias, they will know that I am an apolitical Prime Minister. Apart from elections, I don't get involved into politics ever. You can call elections a necessity, a restraint or a responsibility, we have to do it. I attend many functions, go to different areas, you wouldn't have heard any political comment from me. If I go to a government function, I talk about government related topics. If I attend a Railways function I talk about railways, if water then water, if water bodies, then water bodies. My focus is on governance. Country has been at greatest loss because governments were run only for elections. Governments must not run only for elections. The government should be a bona fide attempt of meeting the demands and expectations of the common people. Elections should just be a bi-product. It is a democracy. Winning and losing is a part of it. It shouldn't be hyped. You would have seen recently I urged everyone to pay taxes before 30th September. I even said it on Mann Ki Baat yesterday. Will a person, who is only concerned with winning elections, say that post 30th September you'd face problems?This was also a warning in a way.It is a warning. It is definitely a warning. It is a warning. My first warning is to my government officers to not presume citizens as thieves. I have already given this warning. I have handled my officers first. It took me quite some time. You will be shocked to hear that I have given an early retirement to more than 30 people from Income Tax Department on integrity issues. This isn't a small issue. People who weren't transferred since 20 years, I got them transferred. So, one, my focus is on my system. Second, I also tell the country, that for the poor of the nation we would have to give out something for the poor in our country. It is my responsibility to give the people an account of every rupee. I will use it at right places. I won't let it get stolen. But if I need to give houses to the poor, we would need revenue. I don't want to increase taxes, I just want taxes to be paid honestly. There is no need to increase the taxes. The country can run without troubling the citizens. I am working towards it. That is why I have given the citizens a chance to pay the taxes till 30th September, whatever it is Rs 10,000 or Rs. 50,000. If they think they want to come into mainstream, they must and shouldn't be worried. After 30th September, the government will have to take steps. I will not worry about the polls. I will take the necessary steps. I want to work for the poor in my country.Mister Prime Minister, do some crystal ball gazing for the next three years. For the next three years, to use the cricketing analogy, how do you find your run rate so far and will you have to score at a higher run rate in the next three years to achieve your targets?See, no matte at what speed I move forward, I am never satisfied. If today I run at a speed of 100, I keep an aim of running at 200. I think that the world that was behind us, has gone ahead. We need to run a lot to match that level. So we do not need to calculate. We just need to give it all in. And I have given myself in completely. I've been successful is pulling my entire government in. I believe that the country is also committed to move forwardFinal question to you Mr Prime Minister, what motivates you the most? First of all as I said, will you be able to keep this pace? What motivates you the most and also if you can share with our viewers honestly what is your one greatest source of worry?Firstly, I don't live under the burden of worries. Problems and challenges are there, you can't deny that. But you must challenge the challenges and not let the challenges turn into worries. This is my principle. I challenge the challenges. I like to face the problems. I don't run away from them. Whatever loss I have to face for it, I face it. But I can't leave the country helpless. This responsibility must be taken and I will continue to do so. For all good and bad things, it is my responsibility. I do not regret anything. I believe, people of the country have given me the responsibility and I must fulfill it. Thirdly, when I see the poor in our country, it reminds me of the work that I have to do for them. Day before yesterday, I was in Pune, and met a Shrimaan Chandrakant ji. A retired teacher with a pension of Rs 16000, donates Rs 5000 every month for Swachh Abhiyaan. If a 70 year old retired teacher with children and family at home, without worrying about them, worries about the country, then being the Prime Minister, I should work a thousand times more than Chandrakant ji. This is my inspiration. People of this country who work day and night, they are my inspiration. I look at them and I work even harder.Prime Minister Narendra Modi it has been a privilege. I am grateful for this interview.Thank youAnd thank you on behalf of all our viewers that you spoke frankly. The program is Frankly Speaking and I am thankful to you that you were so frank.I just request you to not create controversies out of this but instead use it for the benefit of the country.Please do not think like that.

have you achieved of your own targets?when i went for the first time as an mp to the central hall, and it was the first time i was seeing the central hall. i had not been there before. so i had then said that becoming the prime minister was not about the designation of the office but it was about the responsibilities and work of being a pm. i had also said that my government would be committed to the poor. i was completely new in the job. delhi was new for me. the delhi environment was new to me. the work of the government of india was also new for me. but despite that, in such a short time, the pace at which the country has moved forward, and it's not on one subject. you can pick up any aspect of the government's functioning, and if you make a comparison with the past governments, then you will realize that no issue has been ignored. there has been an effort to bring in something new in every area. there is an effort to bring in change in every area. one big challenge was that i was not experienced about this place, i had not even been an mp. the office was new, the questions were also new. but when i look at the second biggest challenge, we should remember those days when the country was engulfed in disappointment. the everyday news was about whether there would be any electricity production after seven days, whether coal would be supplied or not. this was the situation then. the entire system was engulfed in disappointment. the big challenge was to inject new trust into the system and create confidence among the citizens. it is very difficult to evaluate this from the outside but i have gone through it. but today i can say with a lot of satisfaction that now there is no trace of any disappointment. the intention to do something is visible. and it's not in words but in actual achievement. i had said that within a given timeframe, we will open bank accounts for the poor. for something that had not been done for 60 years, setting a timeframe for it was in itself a risk. but because of that a trust was created in the system that it was something doable. so that's the process i started for awakening the confidence. and today you can see that in every sector, the changed circumstances can be seen. while evaluating the performance of this government, never forget that you will have to make that evaluation in comparison with the 10 years of the previous government. only then will you know where we were and where we are now. we should not be talking about what we are aiming for. for now you will have to assess the present in comparison with the immediate past and in that you will find a bright futuremr. modi, i want to start now on the issue of foreign policy. in the area of foreign policy, you have taken great personal interest. the amount of personal interest you have shown in foreign policy, probably none of the previous prime ministers showed the same kind of interest. your approach is pro active. what i find interesting about your foreign policy is that you have balanced different powers and different interests. on the one side, your relationship with us, you made sure that india enters the missile control technology regime with them. a week before that you also signed the historic chabahar port agreement with iran. so, you have balanced very diverse forces. my question to you over this is that, is it easy to do that as an indian prime minister? secondly, on the issue of the nsg, you staked a lot of personal interest, personal push, you lobbied actively. how close are we to getting the nsg seat?firstly, about foreign policy, you need to know what has strengthened our foreign policy. for 30 years, in our country, the government was unstable. for 30 years, party with a clear mandate wasn't given the opportunity to form the government. the world measures the government of a nation on the basis of its condition in its own country, on how strong their word is in their own country. i am thankful to the people of this country, that after 30 years, they chose a government with absolute majority and this has had an impact on world politics. countries and world leaders have changed their perspective towards india. this is the biggest benefit. secondly, the world didn't know me. the world wants to know who the head of the state is. if someone would want to know modi through the eyes of the media, then he would be disillusioned on which modi is the real modi. if this happens, the country will be at a loss. modi's personality shouldn't be a hindrance for the world to have faith in india. but for that unless i meet all those leaders and engage them them one to one, unless i speak to them frankly, they wouldn't know about india's head of state, so it was very important for me as i am not from a political family. i never had the opportunity to meet the world leaders earlier.you were an unknown entity in foreign policymore than foreign policy it was foreign relations. yes, i was new to it. so for me, being pro active was mandatory. thirdly, we work as a team. foreign ministry, prime minister's officer, commerce ministry, finance ministry, defense minister, everyone works as a team, not as separate pieces. the impact that is now visible, is not just because of modi, it is because of the team. all teams work in a particular direction. that is why the impact is seen, earlier these teams were splintered. we have seen instances where the party would give a statement, the prime minister would say something else, party leaders would say something else. this disunity has had a negative impact. thirdly, we also need to understand that earlier the world was bi polar. foreign policy would be centered around two super powers. india was a little late in realizing that this bi polar situation was for namesake. now the entire world, in changed circumstances, especially in 21st century, it is more interdependent and inter connected, earlier, the foreign policy was possible between governments, but today it is not possible just between governments. government relations are important but increasing people to people contact is equally important. there's been a shift in paradigm. because i do not have any previous baggage, because i've had a clean slate, i write everything from beginning and that has a benefit. today we are building relations with countries across the world. the amount of respect with which i engage saudi arabia, i engage iran with the same amount of respect. the amount of respect with which i speak to america, i speak to russia with the same amount of respect. so we need to understand this. we also need to understand that we shouldn't consider smaller countries insignificant. i abide by this principle. the small countries of the world are as important as the big nations. we had assumed that the relations with smaller nations would develop under the shadow of the bigger nations. i brought about a change in this. you must have seen that i made a forum for the pacific island nations. we have had two meetings. i went there once and they came here once. these are small countries with a population of about 10 lakh or 20 lakh. but these small island nations are most affected by global warming. when india took up the international solar mission and 122 nations joined it, the island nations benefitted the most out of it. they are 50 in number now. a group of 50 nations, feels secured with this vision of india. if we try to understand this change, then we would realize that in the world, a few days back, i was sitting with the officers of our foreign services, so as we got talking, in a very poetic way i told them that there was a time when we used to sit by the sea and count the waves, but the time has now changed, we are done counting waves, now it's time for us to steer ourselves, ride the waves and decide on our direction, destination and speedthat is apparent. you have a very aggressive foreign policy. but my second question was, you put so much effort for nsg membership. my question was, how close are we to nsg membership and were you disappointed that we did not make it at the very end because of china's opposition?look the first thing is that india has been continuously making these efforts, no matter which government was in office. be it the membership of the un security council or the sco membership or mtcr membership or nsg membership. every government has made an effort. it's not that only this government is trying, it's in continuity. but it's during our tenure that we achieved sco membership, we also got the mtcr membership. i have full faith that now we have begun a coordinated effort for the nsg membership too. the process has begun on a positive note. everything has rules and will work accordingly and move forwardis it the problem of mindset with china? there have been 13 engagements at various levels between the narendra modi government and the chinese government. the latest engagement was when you went to tashkent. you spent some time with the chinese president xi jinping. yet it was seen that in the case of masood azhar, china blocked india's un bid to ban him. now they have stalled india's nsg bid. why is china repeatedly blocking us mr prime minister despite your personal proactive measures and your government's outreach?the first thing is that we have an ongoing dialogue with china and it should continue to happen. in foreign policy it's not necessary to have similar views to have a conversation. even when the views are contradictory, talks are the only way forward and problems should be resolved through dialogue. we don't have one problem with china, we have a whole lot of problems pending with china. slowly and steadily, an effort is on to address these issues through talks and make them less cumbersome. i can say that china has been cooperating with india to search for solutions. on some issues, it's a question of principles for them. on some issues, it's a question of principles for us. on some issues they differ with us and there are issues on which we differ with them. there are some basic differences. but the most important thing is that we can speak to china eye-to-eye and put forth india's interests in the most unambiguous manner. we are a government that takes care of india's interests. we don't compromise on this. three days ago i met the chinese president. i told him clearly about india's interests. they are a different country, we are a different countrydo you think you will be able to change their mindset on the issue of nsg membership?see the foreign policy is not about changing mindsets. foreign policy is about finding the common meeting points. where do our interests converge and how much? we have to sit and talk with every country. it's our ongoing effortthis statement that you just made is also apt in the context of america where you gave a speech in the u.s congress. by the way mr prime minister it was a fantastic speechthank youthere was a lot of humour. you were laughing and cracking jokes while you delivered the speech which was very unique. they also appreciated it. was the speech impromptu?i have a humourous side but these days humour can be a risky thingwhy do you say that?in this era of 24/7 news channels, anybody can lift a small word and make a big issue out of it. but i will tell you the truth, the reason for the absence of humour in public life is this fear. i am myself scared . earlier when i used to make speeches, i would make it so humourous but there would never be any issueshave you become more conscious now?i am not conscious. i am in fear, there is no humour left in public life because of this fear. everyone is scared. i am in fear. my speeches used be humourous. i see it in parliament, that humour is finished there too. it is a matter of concern. i will quote one proverb.yes, go ahead.even if you mention a proverb, they will connect it with something else and begin a conversation. the one who is saying the proverb does not know for what he is speaking.but you should not lose your sense of humour mr prime ministerbut it is true that my trip to the united states of america, my speech in their congress and the respect shown towards india created a lot of hype. had it not been hyped so much, there would not have been so much criticism on the nsg issue. government is being criticized not for any mishandling of the nsg issue but because we were so successful over there (in the usa)did china become conscious of your growing friendship with us?i am talking about what's happening herebut when you delivered that speech in context of america, you used a very interesting phrase. you said 'we have to overcome the hesitations of history'. my hindi is not that good. like hesitations of history. but my question to you is mr prime minister, how close can we get to america because many indians believe that america is still supporting pakistan, giving them military assistance. how close can we get? at what point do we stop before we are seen like an american ally? what is your own world view on that?i would especially like to appeal to my country's media that we should stop looking at everything in india from the. india is an independent country. it is a country of 125 crore people. whenever it approaches any country, it will only be concerned about its own interests. it has been our biggest shortcoming and mistake that we have been tagging ourselves with another country and trying to do things. we are an independent country, we have our own policies and future. we have to think about the future of our 125 crore people. there should be no compromise on our interests. we have relations with america in the context of these fundamental pointshow close can we get to them?there has been warmth in our relationship. you must have seen the editorials in american newspapers after my visit to that country. one point mentioned in those editorials was that the success of obama's foreign policy has been the warm relationship with india. this has been saidwhat you are saying modiji is that we can be close to america but we need not be an ally or seen to be an ally?the first thing is that we no longer live in a bipolar world. the world is interconnected and interdependent. you will have to connect with everybody at the same time. even if there are two opposing countries, they will have to be friends. now the times have changedmr modi, on 8th may 2014, i had the opportunity to interview you, the interview took place in ahmedabad, i think one last phase of elections was left. we were discussing the issue of pakistan. you have had an uncompromising approach towards pakistan. two days back, lashkar e toiba killed 8 crpf jawans in an attack. in the 8th may interview, you put forth a very interesting phrase, you said 'can talks be heard amidst the noise of bombs, guns and pistols?' this is how you had phrased it. do you believe we have been too generous towards pakistan? do you believe we have been too generous towards pakistan?there are two things. one - india has always wanted friendly ties with its neighbours, there can be no debate around it. we want to live in harmony and peace. and i have said it repeatedly, that india has to fight poverty, pakistan too has to fight poverty, why don't we come together to fight poverty? i said this before elections and during election campaigns. also i had invited leaders of saarc nations to my swearing in ceremony and they had attended it as well. so there has been no change in our intent, our thoughts and our current behaviour. number two - those who have to work from the table, will work from the table and those who have to work at the border, will work at border with full strength. each one will fulfill the responsibility entrusted to them. and our jawans are fulfilling their responsibilities. it's true that pressure on terrorists has increased, their schemes are proving unsuccessful. the intent with which they move forward are foiled and they have to face major challenges. it is because of this disappointment that such incidents are taking place and our jawans are risking their lives and protecting the country. we are very proud of our jawanswhen your foreign policy is studied, observers analyze what's happening and what's not happening. if you give me the opportunity, i want to do a bit of analyses. there was a terrific pace of engagement with pakistan between october, november and december. on 30th november, you met nawaz sharif on the sidelines (of un climate summit in paris). both of you were seated on a sofa, talking to each other. a lot of people were speculating the contents of your conversation. this was on the sidelines of climate summit. after that, all of a sudden within seven days there were nsa level talks and ajit doval spoke to nasir janjua in bangkok. and again after that you went to russia via afghanistan, you made an unexpected visit to nawaz sharif in lahore. it was a personal trip but it still had some level of importance. eight days later, pakistani terrorists attacked pathankot. can you tell our viewers whether pakistan was proactively responding in the months of october, november and december? did the pathankot terror attack change the situation? is it true that pakistan was making a lot of movement in those three months?look there are different types of forces operating in pakistan. but the government only engages with a democratically elected system. our effort for that engagement is continuing. but our supreme objective is peace. our supreme objective is to protect india's interests. we keep making effort toward that objective and sometimes our efforts are successful. as far as meetings and talks are concerned, we signalled right from the day i took oath and sent invitations for the oath taking ceremony, that we seek friendly relations but without compromising on our interests. and that is why i have said that my country's soldiers have full freedom to answer back in whatever manner they have to and they will keep doing thatmr prime minister what is the 'lakshman rekha' that you would draw when it comes to pakistan. there is some confusion surrounding this subject. i would like you to give an elaborate reply. in 2014, it was believed that if talks are being held, then they should be held between two countries and not with hurriyat. it should be between the government of india and the government of pakistan. the other 'lakshman rekha' is that you must act on 26/11. there's been no forward movement so far. the third thing is about forward movement on the pathankot attack case. so what is the 'lakshman rekha' now and if pakistan remains within those bounds, so talks can happen at the political level or at any other level?the first thing is that with pakistan, to whom do we talk to decide about the 'lakshman rekha'. will it be with the elected government or with other actors? that is why india will have to be on alert all the time. india will have to be alert every moment. there can never be any laxity in this. but there is an outcome due to my continuous efforts like my visit to lahore and my invitation to the pakistani prime minister to come to india. now i don't have to explain to the world about india's position. the world is unanimously appreciating india's position. and the world is seeing that pakistan is finding it difficult to respond. if we had become an obstacle, then we would have had to explain to the world that we are not that obstacle. now we don't have to explain to the world. the world knows our intentions. like on the issue of terrorism, the world never bought india's theory on terrorism. they would sometime dismiss it by saying that it's your law and order problem. today the world has to accept what india has been saying about terrorism. india's dialogue on terrorism, the losses india has suffered due to terrorism, the losses suffered by humanity, the world is now acknowledging that. so i believe we have to take this process forwardmr prime minister i now want to move to questions on the economy. in the past two years you have started many schemes. if we look at the theme of jan dhan yojna for financial inclusion, pradhan mantri fasal bima yojna for crop insurance, swach bharat, skill india, make in india. if we see the theme running through these schemes, is your social agenda at the core of your personal economic philosophy, social transformation? is the social agenda at the core of your economic philosophy as the prime minister?the first point is our philosophy is to reach the last man in the line. pandit deendayal upadhyay's philosophy forms the core of our political, economic and social ideology. and even mahatma gandhi used to say that what is there for the last man? so my development parameter is very simple. it is about how the poorest of the poor can benefit from development. the poor is the central focus of my economic agenda. the poor should be strengthened in such a way that they get the willingness to defeat poverty. by helping the poor make ends meet while they remain in poverty is also one of the ways. i am not saying right or wrong but it's one of the ways. but today the country's situation is such that we should make the poor strong so that they become partners in defeating poverty. all these schemes are meant to empower the poor and change the quality of life. the pradhan mantri jan dhan yojna is not only about opening bank accounts for the poor. because of this the poor are feeling that they are becoming a part of the country's economic system. the bank that he was seeing from afar, now he is able to enter that bank. this brings about a psychological transformation. looked at in another way, did you ever imagine that 40 thousand crores could be injected into the banking system by contributions from the poor. the poor who never had bank accounts, have deposited 100 rupees, 50 rupees or 200 rupees. it means that poor man saved 100 rupees and the change began in his life. we have taken up construction of toilets. i had gone to chhattisgarh and had the opportunity to get the blessings of one mother. an adivasi mother heard about the scheme for building toilets. she sold her four goats and built a toilet. that 90 old mother uses a walking stick and goes around the cluster of 30 or 40 houses in the tribal village and has been spreading the message to build toilets. this change is becoming the reason for the change in the quality of life. i have begun the cleanliness campaign. it's estimated an individual spends an average of 7000 rupees for treatment of a disease. the main reason for disease is filth. the poor suffer the most from the filth. if a poor man falls sick, he cannot drive his rickshaw for two days and his children go hungry. so how can we help the poor bring about change in their lives? now there is a neo-middle class and a middle class in the country. the young have their aspirations. so another aspect of my policies you must have seen are the start up india, stand up india, seaport activity, port activity, railways expansion, railway station upgradation. these changes directly appeal to the middle class. the middle class has its aspirations. we have to create jobs? how will job creation happen? till i invest in the development of infrastructure, there be no job creation. you must have seen that the maximum electricity generation since independence has occurred this year. the maximum amount of coal mined has been in this year. the maximum length of roads being constructed daily is happening in this year. the fastest loading and unloading of steamers at sea ports is happening now. all these changes are creating opportunities for employment like in start up india, stand up india. for instance in stand up india, i have said that every bank should give an economic opportunity to one woman, one dalit or one tribal person to become entrepreneurs. this will create many job opportunities. so this is the basis of my economic philosophy.mr prime minister if i could interrupt you on this. on the one hand is the people's expectations and on the other is your vision. many programs that you have mentioned, you can't put a calendar date to it but they don't have an immediate impact. they maybe able to show results in 3, 4, 5 maybe beyond 5 years. now there are challenges in that. mr prime minister, you are aware more than anyone else that people want immediate results. now you spoke of job creation. the first thing, as an achievement you have managed to grow the economy at 7.5 per cent when the global economic climate is very bleak. you have spoken about it as well. you have met fiscal deficit targets, fdi inflows have increased but people are saying that job opportunities are not increasing. you have spoken about infrastructure but the current rate of unemployment. mr prime minister, the latest labour bureau figures, is it a source of concern for you as the prime minister?the first thing is that are 800 million people below the age of 35 in our country. we have to accept that the demand for jobs is very high. but where will they get employment? investment will come in. it will be used in the infrastructure sector, manufacturing and services sector. now like the initiative we have taken, we have started the mudra yojna. more than three crore people in the country comprise washermen, barbers, milkman, newspaper vendors, cart vendors. we have given them nearly 1.25 lakh crore rupees without any guarantee. now why have these people taken the money? to expand their work. when he expands his work, if he is currently employing one person, now he has to employ two people. if there were two employed earlier, now there are three. now just think, when 3 crore of these small businesses have got access to finance, they must have expanded their work. now all this is not in the labour department's registration. three crore people have expanded their work. we took another small decision. the big malls in the country run 365 days a year but the smaller shops have to close on holidays. we announced in the budget that even a small shopkeeper can operate his shop till late night and that too on all the seven days of the week. if the malls don't have restrictions then why should the small shopkeepers have restrictions. so now if a shopkeeper operates his shop till late and on all seven days, if he earlier employed one person, now he will have to employ two people. so won't the employment increase?so is your focus on entrepreneurship?our focus is on all aspects. now we are saying that by 2022 we want to ensure that everyone has a house. housing sector has the maximum potential for creating employment. houses will be built in such huge numbers, how many people will get employment? you must have seen that last year we brought in a textile policy. under this textile policy, there will be income tax benefits for those who create employment. the more employment one creates, the more tax benefits they will get. for the first time, employment generation and tax has been linked. these are the things that boost employment and our central focus is creating employment for the ordinary citizenmr prime minister, questions are also being raised on food inflation which has still not decreased. the expectation was that the food inflation would decline. the people had put their hopes on the prime minister that you will bring down prices. this not only has a political impact but also has a social impact. over the past two weeks, there were reports that in some places the price of arhar dal had touched 150 rupees and 200 rupees for other pulses. the price of tomatoes was also rising. is this only seasonal because the food inflation is increasing at 7.5 per cent year on year. global oil prices have fallen. do you think this creates perception issues for your government?you can't view inflation as a perception issue. price rise should be seen as a reality. what is available for a consumer should be seen for what it is. there should never be an attempt to view price rise as a perception issue as a means of escaping the reality of price rise. we will have to accept reality. you see the fast pace at which prices were rising under the previous government, today that speed has decelerated a lot. you can see the statistics, you will find it there. second, the country has gone through two consecutive years of severe drought. drought has a direct impact on the price of vegetables, food and pulses because all these things are produced from the soil. now when there is such a big drought, it's not in anybody's hands. the second option in such a situation is imports. the indian government has imported pulses in huge quantities. third, it is the joint responsibility of the state and central governments. it is not exclusively the state's responsibility. it is not exclusively the centre's responsibility. it is the joint responsibility of both the state and central governments. this should not be an issue of blame game that the state government did not do certain things and that the centre did not do certain things. but it will have to be agreed that it is the joint responsibility of both. that is why the centre has given rights to the states to make stringent laws. how much stocks to keep or not to keep are decisions which the states can take. all these rights have been given to the states. some states have performed well, some states are trying. but the centre and state governments are trying to work together on this. i believe that we have been successful to the extent that the speed with which prices were rising (under upa), what would have happened if the prices were to rise at that speed. we have been successful in stopping that speedy rise of prices. but as far as pulses are concerned, production in india has been very low. many farmers who were earlier sowing pulses have started cultivating sugar. that is also an area of concern. we gave special incentives for pulses. we have tried to set up a different msp for pulses. we have taken steps to procure pulses from farmers with bonus. our focus is on increasing the production of pulses. we are also focusing on building stocks of pulses by importing from abroad. an all out effort is being made and i believe that nobody doubts the sincerity of this governmentmr prime minister what is your view about the controversy around the exit of raghuram rajan as the rbi governor? a lot has been spoken about this. there was commentary that it may effect india's image, perception as a global economy. what's your own view of the controversy around the exit of raghuram rajan?when my government was formed in may 2014, you take newspapers from may, june, july 2014 and check television debates during that period. the topic of the television debates would be - will the new govt let raghuram rajan continue? or will the new government oust raghuram rajan? and there was more or less consensus that he was appointed by the previous govt and so modi won't let him complete his tenure and will remove him. you have seen, that he worked his entire tenure. for the time he was appointed by the previous government, he completing his entire term. so all the misconceptions have been dispelled. secondly, according to my 2 year experience in govt, those who are creating controversies, are being unjust to raghuram rajanwhy so?i will tell you. those who say...i believe raghuram rajan's patriotism is no less than any of ours. it will be doing injustice to him if one says that he will serve the country only if he is at a particular post. as much as i know raghuram rajan, whatever post he holds, wherever he is, he is someone who will continue to serve the country. he is someone who loves his country. therefore, it's not like the nation won't get raghuram rajan's services, raghuram rajan is not that kind of a person. he is a person who loves the country. those who speak such language are doing great injustice to him. my experience with him has been good.i appreciate the work he has done. and my good wishes will always be with himprime minister modi, there's a question related to this. during your speech at the executive you used seven words begining with letter 's'-- 'sevabhaav' (service), 'santulan' (balance), 'sanyam' (restraint), 'samvaad' (dialogue), 'samanvay' (coordination), 'sakaratmak' (positivity) and 'samvedna' (sensitivity). i will ask the question in context with raghuram rajan because you used these words in the speech at national executive meet speech on june 14 in allahabad. you said, 'our party leaders and party workers should use these qualities in their daily dealings and behaviour.' prime minister, in raghuram rajan's context, your rajya sabha mp has made many comments. later he made critical remarks against senior bureaucrats. my question is, do you think it is right? when we talk about 'sanyam' (restraint) and 'santulan' (balance), is it correct?whether it is someone from my party or not, i believe that such things are inappropriate. the nation won't benefit from such publicity stunts. one should be more responsible while conducting themselves. anyone who believes he is bigger than the system is wrong.that's a very clear message.i have a very clear message. i have no two minds about it.and mr prime minister, if i may say so, between may 8 and now, you are speaking as straight as you did before you took over as prime minister. i think that answer takes me to the next subject. mr prime minister, the issue is that of black money. in a very interersting way you said, prices should not be looked at from the point of percepetion, equally, mr prime minister it can be said said that an issue like black money should not be looked at in terms of perception, but it is perception forming. there are political debates on this. experts say that the black money economy has shrunk, 10-15% economy has shrunk through land dealings and other things. you have passed the black money bill, you have made taxation more transparent, you have started information sharing with other countries, you have taken steps, but prime minister modi, people still expect that a rs 25 lakh crores will be brought back and put into their bank accounts. how will you address that expectation? the hope that people have taking black money, how will you address it?how did the black money issue arise and how did it become such a serious issue? we have to look at the background. it is an established fact in the minds of the common man those who steal money park their money overseas. it's a common perception. even if i look at it from the common man's perspective, i also wonder where does this money go? this issue was always stalled in the parliament. when the matter reached the supreme court, the supreme court ordered special investigation team to look into it, even then the previous government stalled it for three years, from 2011-2014. it's after this that political parties, the media and the common man started believing that there's something wrong. then the issue of black money became an agenda. even today i can say...that yes, when there is money stashed in foreign accounts, there are some norms of engagement with foreign countries on the issue. but between 2011-2014, these people were given the opportunity to launder money here and thereand you also said on 17 february 2015 on this issue, that the then law minister is only offering lip servicethe result was that people got several chances to launder money. secondly, after our government was formed, the first decision taken by our cabinet was to form a special investigation team to bring back black money which was pending despite supreme court's 2011 order. this shows our sincerity. from then on, you can't imagine how stringent the laws have been made to bring back black money and whoever comes in its fold will know how strict the law is. thirdly, i attended the g20 summit. never was black money issue discussed in the g20 forum. it was my first g20 summit, for the first time i met the world leaders. and for the first time in the g20 summit, one paragraph was on unaccounted money, on black money and 20 countries said that the world should cooperateblack. the dirty money, black money was also linked to terrorism, an environment of global census was created. we have been signing agreements one after the other with different countries that there will be real time, automatic exchange of information with india. i recently visited switzerland and there was minimal discussion on the issue. but after i returned, a big delegation from switzerland visited india, and they held meeting with the indian government and we discussed...for several years, we believed that switzerland is the place where black money is stashed, that country is holding discussions to come to a consensus on automatic information exchange and if we reach consensus it will be a great achievement. thirdly you must've seen that mauritius route came up in almost everything. it was said that money goes out of india and returns through the mauritius route. this was discussed. everyone thought that nothing can be done about the mauritius route.but our government held a dialogue with the mauritius government, made changes to the old treaty. and we successfully made a new treaty to block the money which comes through the mauritius route and very soon it will be phased out and completed. all these decisions are taken to fight the black money menace. this is not a one sided fight. secondly, the govt is working in a direction to make sure that black money isn't generated in india and black money doesn't go out of india, you can see the results of all this.when the opposition raises the rs 15 lakh issue.that is something the opposition raises during elections. let them have some issue to talk aboutmr prime minister, there has been no major financial corruption or scam in your tenure in the last two years. perception is again, what people say is because you keep a very tight control on the reins of government but the question is there are people, who are wilful defaulters, the economic offenders who take a lot of money from the country or commit economic offences in the country, go overseas and use rules and use lawyers, and they don't come back to india. and people are asking now, is the narendra modi govt determined to take these cases of wilful defaulters and economic offenders to their logical conclusion.firstly, this question is not in the minds of people. the people of india have confidence that if there's someone who can do this, it is narendra modi and he will do it. citizens of the country have full faith.does it worry you, that people have misued the law?i take this as an opportunity and i will show them what the law is.mr. modi, there have been several corruption cases about the previous government, which have now come out. there is agustawestland, many defense scams and defense transactions are now being analyzed seriously. the cases which were quoted in the cag reports but were ignored are now coming in the forefront. this question is important because this isn't just about financial corruption but these questions have direct implications on the national security of the country. do you think, when they say that this is a political witch hunt by narendra modi sarkar, do you think all of these cases would have been possible without political patronage?there are many things which are not visible. one can't imagine the difficulty i am experiencing in taking out things from dirt. one who is working there knows the amount of dirt that exists and how certain things have been caught in a web. there are certain powers behind it. the case about agusta helicopters. i can't deny it and i believe that we have the right to doubt that people behind this are very experienced. they have perfectly practiced the art of doing wrong deeds. they are very experienced and knowledgeable. and one can also smell the fact that such a thing wouldn't have been done without a shield. now, agencies are probing. let's see how far the probe goes. but the investigation shouldn't go ahead while people are being targeted, neither does my government target anyone. the sin has been committed, but how much is done, how was it done, who did it, probe agencies will find out in a professional way. whatever comes out, will be put outprime minister, talking about your speech in the us congress, and the humour that you displayed. i felt some of it was impromptu. but the americans were able to relate to what you said, i don't remember the exact words, you said, i am informed that the working of the us congress is harmonious. and then there was a pause and people were laughing. then you said, 'i am told' - you emphasized and said 'i am told that you are well known for your bipartisanship.' then the applause was more. and then you said, 'you are not alone. time and again i have witnessed a similar spirit in the indian parliament.' you spoke about a serious topic in a interesting manner. you referred to the upper house. there was a lot of response on that too. your humour was really appreciated and i think it was a wonderful moment when you were speaking. but, mr. prime minister, when you look back at the parliament, this question comes to many people's minds, has prime minister narendra modi being held back from achieving his own objectives because of the non-stop parliamentary logjam. how much has this affected his moving towards his own targets? if you critically analyze this situation, do you feel your government could have been more consultative or do you feel the blame is entirely with the opposition?i look at it differently. i believe there have been a lot of problems. whether the fault is ours or their's, i 'll leave it to the people. people will decide. but because of discussions in parliament - we may not come to a decision, the decision could be opposing our view, nothing wrong in that. but at least there should be a discussion. the sad part is, if somebody is running away from debate or don't let discussions happen, then it is a cause of worry in a democracy. whether the government's work is accomplished or not, i don't see it as a cause of worry. if not today, it will happen tomorrow. there are certain things which will happen at an administrative level. the big thing is, parliament is for discussion. parliament is to show dissent. parliament is to give an argument for one's opposition, to present an argument when they support.to uphold this basic spirit of parliament, is the responsibility of every person who values democracy. it is the responsibility of those present in the parliament and those outside. it is the responsibility of those in power and those not in power. this is a matter of spirit and it should be followed. as far as the government is concerned, on every issue and at every forum, we have tried to hold discussions. i myself have met the opposition leaders and spoken to them. key members of the government are also in touch. and you must have seen that many issues have been resolved. in the last session, we have passed 12 bills in rajya sabha, we passed 10 bills in the lok sabha. so the pace has picked up. when people say 'opposition', it is unfair to the opposition. there are some parties in the parliament which are not with the bjp or nda, but are with the government on key decisions. so, to defame the opposition by saying that all opposition parties are against us -- when some people do this, it is wrong. there is one party which has problems. and the whole world knows that party. secondly, to say that 'when you were is opposition, you did it this way' there is a difference between every opposition party. 'we have run the government for 60 years and now we are in the opposition, so we know the nitty-gritties of the government, we know the responsibilities. we can't behave in the way, a new opposition party behaves.' a party which hasn't been in power or hasn't seen anything, could behave in this way. for example, we are in power now, and consider in 2040 we become the opposition party. so, in 2040 we can't have the same conduct as the one we had in 2009 or 2010.congress is a very experienced and old partythat's why i say that, those who have been in power for so many years, shouldn't be doing this. if there is a new party in the opposition, they have a small demand for their state or if an mp has a demand for his/her constituency and does something like this, then we can understand. ones who have been in power for very long, shouldn't be doing such thingsprime minister modi, do you think the gst bill which has been stuck for over one and half years, it is a path-breaking economic reform. it unifies the country. recently you met ms jayalalithaa after she was sworn in as the chief minister, mamata banerjee has extended her support for gst and congress allies at the state level are supporting the gst bill. do you feel optimistic that gst bill will be passed in the next session of the parliament?first we need to understand, that we look at gst only within the purview of an economic reform because of which the right information doesn't come out. not having gst straight away means loss for the poor of uttar pradesh. absence of gst straight away means loss for the poor people of bihar. not passing the gst would mean loss for the poor people of poor states like bengal, orissa and assam. people who sit in the rajya sabha must understand this. gst is beneficial for the poor people of the states represented by them, because those states will economically benefit the most from gst. the money will be used for the welfare of the poor people of those states. this is why be it mamata banerjee, be it nitish kumar, be it akhilesh yadav or naveen patnaik, all these states want the gst bill to be passed at the earliest. there is just one group which has made it the issue of prestige. now the kind of arithmetic which is working out, i hope that this decision is passed in favour of the poor. you will be surprised to what extent has the opposition reached to the level of distortion. in the previous session we introduced an act. indian government has rs 40,000 crore rupees from the campa fund. rs 40,000 crore. we wanted to give that money to the states. states have to use that money for forestry, for greenery, for planting trees and plants. the bill is meant for that. had this rs 40,000 crore reached the states before the monsoons, it would have been used for the forests. a lot of people would have got employment, people who plant trees would have been employed. there would be plantation and due to the rains the plants would start growing within a year. but just because of obstructionism, states have been deprived of the benefit of rs 40,000 crore. the money was meant for the forests and for the tribals. they blocked it. there was no argument on itthe reason...you had triedmade all efforts.you had invited former prime minister manmohan singh and sonia gandhi here at the race course roadwe held talks at every levelstill? the word you used 'ego issue', why has it become an ego issue? and people would want to know why is the prime minister unable to end this?the prime minister cannot answer this question. those creating obstructions can only answer this question. but despite this, i will keep trying. i am ready to convince them in which ever way possible. if i have to convoke someone over a cup of tea at their house, i am even ready for that. i have no problem. my only aim is the welfare of the poor of my country and the poor of states like uttar pradesh.you spoke of uttar pradesh. mr prime minister, elections will be held in uttar pradesh in 6,7,8 months. the focus of entire nation will be on it. you are the mp from varanasi. but some comments are made by bjp, some say sangh parivar, some independent groups, communal colour is added to it and not just from one party but from other parties as well. mr prime minister are you going to be able to keep development as the sole agenda? the main issue in the uttar pradesh polls should be that of development, it shouldn't get capsized, the focus shouldn't be elsewhere. are you confident that communal agenda will not overpower development?it's my conviction, it's my commitment. you must have seen during the 2014 elections that i fought elections on the issue of development. the new generation of the country only believes in development. i believe that solution to all problems is in development. development is also the solution to the tension that people talk about. if we provide employment to people, if we ensure there's food on their plates, if we provide them with facilities and give them education, all the tension will end. and this is why, all those who want good for the nation, i request them to compete towards development and for development. this atmosphere should be created in the country and i think such an environment is being created nowadays.so the hot heads who make extreme comments, is there a necessity to control them? so that there is no politics in the name of religionfirstly, i am of the firm belief that the nation should progress on the issue of development. and it is necessary that the country moves forward on the issue of development. i would like to tell the media not to make heroes out of those people who make such comments.but they keep making such commentsdon't make them heroes, they will stopwe don't make them heroes, we make them villains.but why do you make them so big? i see such statements by people on tv, whose faces i haven't even seen and they end up becoming spokesmen on tvself styled spokesmeni don't know why such people are encouragedmr prime minister, let's talk in 2016 of the 2017 elections. after delhi, then bihar, then assam, west bengal. after that we will talk about punjab. before we finish talking about punjab, we will talk about uttar pradesh. then there is the gujarat state election. don't you think that this country is permanently stuck in an electoral cycle? the focus constantly and i want you to reflect on this issue, the focus is on party politics, polarising issues, not on governance. we are a country, if we say, we are constantly in a political campaign mode. is this a good thing? should we break away from it? and what is your view on it?see this is not an issue about narendra modi or the prime minister. and also it is not an issue about a particular party or a particular government.but before the last parliament session, the speaker had called all the parties for a meal. after the agenda meeting everyone was sitting to eat. i had also reached at the same time. while talking casually over food, almost people from all parties said that the central and state elections must be held together. everyone said it. after that during the farewell function of the rajya sabha mps, people from different parties were talking with each other. one of the leaders said, modiji do anything but get us out of this cycle of electionswas that leader from your party?no, he was not from my party. so i said that discussion should happen. what is wrong in that? then one day i said that this was being talked about. this issue has also been discussed in a parliamentary committee. this work has also been started by the election commission and i think they have also writen a letter on it. like in the fight against black money, this issue of elections also gets connected to black money. electoral reforms are necessary if the country has to be rid of black money. it is one of the areas for electoral reforms. i believe that the prime minister cannot take a decision on this and nor should he do that. neither the government can do this. there should be a broad discussion on this and we should not run away from the debate on this continious cycle of elections. the indian voter today is very mature. he votes in one fashion in the lok sabha elections, he votes in a different manner in the state assembly elections. we have seen this. in 2014, the general elections conincided with the odisha assembly elections. the same electorate gave one judgement for odisha and another judgement for delhi. so this country's voter is very mature and we should trust his maturity. there should be a debate on how costs can be reduced by holding simultaneous elections, how the influence of black money can be curbed, how the five years can be spent in taking the country forward. today due to the model code of conduct, there is a loss even in those areas where the code is not applicable. when i was in gujarat, i found that at least 80 to 90 officers were spending two to three months on election duties in other states. this could be happening in every state. so this is an area of concern and some time or the other this question will have to be thought of. i would want the election commission to take this debate forward. they should invite all political parties and hold discussions with everybody and whatever comes out of itcan there be a timebound resolution in this?the election commission will have to invite all political parties to discuss this. the process will get derailed if one party were to initiate thisare you willing to take the lead in building that consensus?despite being the prime minister, i still belong to a political party. the better thing would be for the election commission to initiate this. today the election commission is a very prestigious institution in our country. every political party believes in the election commission and it will further empower this institution and that will be betteri think it is an interesting idea of simultaneous elections. though state parties, regional parties may feel that it will effect them badly. that the national parties like the bjp will gainodisha is the best example. odisha is the best example. in 2014, the bjp had no advantage in the state but the bjp won on the lok sabha seats. this shows the differencemr prime minister how are you keeping your schedule nowadays? i mean you keep a terrifying pace. the number of meetings you hold, people say your officers find it hard to keep upit is not so, it has been 2 years now and everyone is used to the work. i believe that it is such a big country that one must do as much work as possible. so i keep doing thatbefore i come to my last question mr prime minister, one issue that i want to come to is the farmers' crisis. as you are well aware, there has been a crisis in this country, you referred to it. in that speech to your mps, about which i asked you earlier as well, on 20th may in the central hall of parliament you said that 'this government is not for myself, this government is for the poor, we must do something for them.' the farmers' crisis mr prime minster is a reality. i am glad that in this interview you have not avoided the reality, you've faced it, you've talked about it. we have linked our entire future to the monsoons. how do we overcome this from becoming an annual crisis in this country?we will have to put stress on water management here. you must have seen that under the pradhan mantri krishi sinchayi yojana, we have put stress on water issues. during these drought days, i met leaders from 11 states separately and sat with them for about 2-3 hours each. the country would have believed that their prime minister is working even if i had held a meeting with 11 of them together for around 10 minutes. but i didn't do that. i sat with leaders from different states separately to understand specific problems and what we could do for water in those states. i am happy, whichever party the state government affiliated to, all the governments focused a lot on water issues this summer. we will reap its benefits this monsoon. using scientific methods for water accumulation and irrigation, collecting water and directing them towards the fields, everyone did that. micro irrigation is stressed upon. even for sugarcane farming, farmers are slowly moving towards micro irrigation which earlier happened through flood irrigation. paddy crops for which large amount of water is used. today, farmers have started using drip irrigation for it. if we do well in water facilities, then one of the problems is solved. after independence, for the first time, we have brought in pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana which can cover maximum number of farmers. the farmer will have to pay only 2%, only 2%, the government will take care of the rest. the farmers will get an assurance. for instance, in maharashtra, the monsoons are expected in the month of june, the farmers have prepared for everything but haven't started with the sowing process. now if there are no rains till august, so practically his crops have not been damaged, because he did not sow the seeds. but the pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana even takes this into consideration and benefits the farmer. another important aspect, once the crops are harvested, they're cut and kept in the field, assuming it has been a good year for crop growth, with 100% crop production, but it hasn't been loaded on trucks and sent to the market yet. and if it rains, even after 15 days of harvesting, if there is loss, it is covered under pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana. second layer of protection, minimum premium with maximum cover. after independence, for the first time, we have brought in pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana. thirdly, first time we have brought in e-mandi concept. farmer in the village, can sell the crops to the best markets in the country through his mobile phone. farmer would set the price at which the crop would be sold. earlier, farmers used to take the produce on carts or tractors, used to go to a mandi 20-25kms away, then due to storage issues, even if they had to sell for rs 10 less than the price, they used to sell it. now, sitting at home the farmer would know what price to sell the crops at. next point is about, food processing, value addition. we opened up 100% foreign direct investment in food processing. for example, if a farmer is selling tomatoes and if a company is processing tomato ketchup then my farmers would benefit from it. the companies that make aerated drinks, coca-cola, pepsi etc, i requested them to add 5% natural fruit juice. in regions near nagpur and vidarbha where oranges are cultivated, coca-cola is going to add 5% of orange juice. if we add 5% natural juice to aerated water, farmers would get their market and their fruits wouldn't go waste. we should have a comprehensive all-out scheme. so much of our land has been damaged. we have brought in soil health card. we have a soil health abhiyan. the farmer will know the feritility of the land through it. whether a fertilizer needs to be used or not, the farmer will understand. on an average, a farmer with 1 hectare of land will be able to save rs 15000-20000. so we have brought in scientific methods. you would know that in our country, farmers used to be lathicharged when they would go to buy urea and they had to buy it in black. we got urea 100% neem coated. earlier, urea used to go to chemical factories, and the government subsidies were stolen in the name of farmers. after neem coating, urea cannot be used for any other purpose except farming. because of neem coating, there is a qualitative change which helps in healing the damaged land. due to neem coating a piece of land that used 10 kgs of urea can now manage with 7 kgs of urea. all these initiatives are in the direction of agriculture and the results will be seen soon.do you think that the farmers' crisis will be resolved, the question i asked, that it won't be an annual affair, the dependence on monsoons will go down?see agriculture is a state subject. the indian government has taken initiatives, if the state government are enthusiastic to implement this, which i think they will be. as i told you i met leaders from different states and they worked a lot for water issues. if this works, pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana has direct involvement of the central government, it will have great benefits.mr prime minister now i have two questions for you.this has become too long.i'll club these two (questions) together. you're also enjoying it and i am glad you're speaking mr prime minister because there is so much ground to cover and i think viewers would like to hear your view, sir. actually there are three, if you allow me. they're short questions. first is that prime minister narendra modi, how much is politics playing on your mind? in the sense that every prime minister, especially someone who is as forthright as you, looks at the next big challenge. is 2019 anywhere in your mind?those who have seen me in gujarat, and those who have seen me in the last two years, those who see me without any bias, they will know that i am an apolitical prime minister. apart from elections, i don't get involved into politics ever. you can call elections a necessity, a restraint or a responsibility, we have to do it. i attend many functions, go to different areas, you wouldn't have heard any political comment from me. if i go to a government function, i talk about government related topics. if i attend a railways function i talk about railways, if water then water, if water bodies, then water bodies. my focus is on governance. country has been at greatest loss because governments were run only for elections. governments must not run only for elections. the government should be a bona fide attempt of meeting the demands and expectations of the common people. elections should just be a bi-product. it is a democracy. winning and losing is a part of it. it shouldn't be hyped. you would have seen recently i urged everyone to pay taxes before 30th september. i even said it on mann ki baat yesterday. will a person, who is only concerned with winning elections, say that post 30th september you'd face problems?this was also a warning in a way.it is a warning. it is definitely a warning. it is a warning. my first warning is to my government officers to not presume citizens as thieves. i have already given this warning. i have handled my officers first. it took me quite some time. you will be shocked to hear that i have given an early retirement to more than 30 people from income tax department on integrity issues. this isn't a small issue. people who weren't transferred since 20 years, i got them transferred. so, one, my focus is on my system. second, i also tell the country, that for the poor of the nation we would have to give out something for the poor in our country. it is my responsibility to give the people an account of every rupee. i will use it at right places. i won't let it get stolen. but if i need to give houses to the poor, we would need revenue. i don't want to increase taxes, i just want taxes to be paid honestly. there is no need to increase the taxes. the country can run without troubling the citizens. i am working towards it. that is why i have given the citizens a chance to pay the taxes till 30th september, whatever it is rs 10,000 or rs. 50,000. if they think they want to come into mainstream, they must and shouldn't be worried. after 30th september, the government will have to take steps. i will not worry about the polls. i will take the necessary steps. i want to work for the poor in my country.mister prime minister, do some crystal ball gazing for the next three years. for the next three years, to use the cricketing analogy, how do you find your run rate so far and will you have to score at a higher run rate in the next three years to achieve your targets?see, no matte at what speed i move forward, i am never satisfied. if today i run at a speed of 100, i keep an aim of running at 200. i think that the world that was behind us, has gone ahead. we need to run a lot to match that level. so we do not need to calculate. we just need to give it all in. and i have given myself in completely. i've been successful is pulling my entire government in. i believe that the country is also committed to move forwardfinal question to you mr prime minister, what motivates you the most? first of all as i said, will you be able to keep this pace? what motivates you the most and also if you can share with our viewers honestly what is your one greatest source of worry?firstly, i don't live under the burden of worries. problems and challenges are there, you can't deny that. but you must challenge the challenges and not let the challenges turn into worries. this is my principle. i challenge the challenges. i like to face the problems. i don't run away from them. whatever loss i have to face for it, i face it. but i can't leave the country helpless. this responsibility must be taken and i will continue to do so. for all good and bad things, it is my responsibility. i do not regret anything. i believe, people of the country have given me the responsibility and i must fulfill it. thirdly, when i see the poor in our country, it reminds me of the work that i have to do for them. day before yesterday, i was in pune, and met a shrimaan chandrakant ji. a retired teacher with a pension of rs 16000, donates rs 5000 every month for swachh abhiyaan. if a 70 year old retired teacher with children and family at home, without worrying about them, worries about the country, then being the prime minister, i should work a thousand times more than chandrakant ji. this is my inspiration. people of this country who work day and night, they are my inspiration. i look at them and i work even harder.prime minister narendra modi it has been a privilege. i am grateful for this interview.thank youand thank you on behalf of all our viewers that you spoke frankly. the program is frankly speaking and i am thankful to you that you were so frank.i just request you to not create controversies out of this but instead use it for the benefit of the country.please do not think like that. thank you very muchthanks a lot. thank you very much."

The rains have cooled down the day's heat, but chillies and tomatoes remain red hot to the touch of Goa's aam aadmi, with the summer fallout continuing to affect the prices of these vegetablesYouMore than a week ago, TOI had reported on the prices of vegetables like tomatoes, chillies, beans and coriander, which had doubled in a week.Vendors had attributed it to the exceeding heat in April and May, which led to poor crop produce during this season and the drying up of supplies.Tomato prices had shot to 75-80 in retail stores and vegetable outlets across Goa and still remains out of reach for the consumer.""Most vegetables are sourced from Belagavi. Due to crop crisis in parts of Maharashtra and shortage in Hyderabad, vegetables were directed to these places from Belgavi. With so much pressure on Belagavi to provide for other places, Goa would obviously feel the pinch,"" said a vegetable vendor Dayanand Amonkar.Another vendor, Nizamuddin Khan said that some of the stock is being sourced from Manguluru and Nashik in order to meet Goa's requirement for tomatoes. ""Our agents in Belgavi are feeling the hit and they were forced to look at alternatives,"" he said.

Unable to marry her because his wife was not granting him divorce, he hatched a plot to bump her off.In late 2009, Dedhia, who then lived in Meghchhaya Apartments, Lalbaug, with his parents, wife and son, was led to Hasruddin Malik, a tomato vendor, by a vegetable vendor, Rajnikant Wagh. Malik, in turn, made him meet Nazim Khan, a taxi driver. On October 4, Dedhia, Malik and Khan met at Lalbaug and worked out the particulars of the conspiracy. Malik and Khan were to carry out the killing. The amount offered for the 'supari' was Rs 1 lakh.Early morning on October 27, Dedhia prodded Beena to go on their usual walk. Around 5.30am, Malik and Khan, who were on a motorcycle, with Khan riding pillion, attacked Beena. She was stabbed on the neck, but afraid that she may not succumb to her injury, Dedhia told Khan to finish the job properly. Khan then stabbed Beena twice in the stomach. Jitendra made himself suffer minor injuries and made the crime look like an incident of chain snatching horribly gone wrong. The police initially probed the chain snatching angle, but about a month later received information that the murder was contract killing (after solving the case, the police said that three previous attempts had been made on Beena's life).On December 17, 2009, acting on a tip-off, the crime branch arrested Khan, who used to live in Vijay Nagar, Antop Hill. The police said that during interrogation, he revealed the name of Malik. It was Malik who spilled the beans on the conspiracy.Special public prosecutor Rohini Salian told TOI that the clinching evidence was Dedhia's call data records, which showed that he had contacted the killers half an hour before the attack, telling them about the area of the morning walk. She said what sealed the case was the recovery of the murder weapon, a knife, from the killers, an advance payment of Rs 29,000 made by Dedhia and a photograph of Beena provided by him.The quantum of sentence against the three convicts will be decided by sessions Judge Sanjay Patil after prosecution and defence present arguments on Monday. The maximum sentence under the charge of murder is death while the minimum is life imprisonment. Wagh had been earlier acquitted. The Dedhia couple's son was 11 when the crime was committed.

Although pre-fried, the potato chunks are grilled and heated at the caf, and retain their crunchy cover.We spot a baked vada pav (Rs. 70), and give into temptation, adding an indulgent order of mushroom black pepper petit (Rs. 110), which is a Danish open bread topped with mozzarella.

The aloo stuffing is laden with coriander seeds, garlic and turmeric, and ismasaledaarwithout being overtly spicy. Its a must eat especially with the dry thencha chutney.Latest delicacyOur gut instinct signals we end the meal, but Aimie has a new friend, and we want to try it.

The MIDC has reserved 50 hectares (125 acres) for food processing units at Vinchur.An MIDC official said, ""Around 31 small food processing units have applied for allotment of plots in the range of 0.5 acres to two acres. The investment in these 31 units is estimated at Rs 50.14 crore. The move is expected to generate employment for around 1,000 people.""These units will process frozen foods, mango & other fruit pulps, raisin, onion powder, biscuits, cookies, papad pickles, tomato products, bakery & confectionery products and fruit juices among other items.The state government set up the Godavari Wine Park at Vinchur near Nashik in 2001 in a bid to promote wine industry. Of the total 133 hectares (332 acres) land, the wine park had been developed on 83 hectares (208 acres). As only five wineries became operational in the wine park, the industries had demanded the government to allow food processing units on the remaining 50 hectares (125 acres).During an industrial exhibition in April last year, Nashik-based industrial associations had approached state industries minister Subhash Desai with their demand.

A more recent survey has shown that over 36% of children in the state are stunted. A meeting on Tuesday of NGOs, which health minister Rajendra Singh Rathore also addressed, dwelt on nutrition financing in the state. The one speaker who had much to offer in terms of learning was Suprabha Agarwal, head of the nutrition mission of Maharashtra.Jack Clift of international NGO Results for Development said his studies had shown that there was a 69% shortfall in nutrition financing in the state. Not only is the allocation insufficient, what money is indeed allocated is not entirely utilized. Under the ICDS programme, for instance, figures for 2014-15 showed 41% underutilization of funds in Rajasthan.Suprabha Agarwal, director of the nutrition mission of Maharashtra, said the nutrition mission in her state was not an implementing agency - it was concerned with proper utilization of resources and strengthening the work of field workers. The mission was launched in 2005, and in the first phase, the emphasis was on strengthening ICDS. In the second phase that began from 2010, the need for effective communication was understood; some feedback received from the community was worked into the programme. It was also recognized that malnutrition cannot be 'treated' - it was best to work for prevention, and for that, women in the fertile age range needed to be properly nourished. The programme has now entered its third phase.Agarwal said the mission worked with a slim team of less than 10 experts for the whole state. However, working with grassroots level workers and encouraging them to adopt imaginative ways to resolve problems has shown great results.""We asked communities to contribute, and received Rs200 crore. We told our anganwadi workers that they should hang out baskets in front of their anganwadis and encourage people to contribute whatever they could. A farmer might only put in one tomato and another might deliver two brinjals - all this could go into the meal cooked for children. The response has been phenomenal. We thought we might only gather enough material for the use of the angwanwadi on one day, but we find we are gathering a surplus and have now devised local earthenware-made refrigeration to store vegetables. During the drought, some farmers told us that they could not offer vegetables, and so gave us some grain. We now have a storage problem to deal with!""Agarwal spoke of effective partnerships with corporate firms under the CSR head, and also networking and collections from communities. ""However, even now, we often have to explain the need for our work to other departments of government. That is one challenge, working in coordination with different wings of the government whose functions overlap. And we need our experts to serve longer terms so that there is continuity in our work.

Though it's all in jest, Rakesh knows it's their way of winking at the dark cloud that settled over their family in June last year. A medical test revealed that their obedient son - who had pursued mechanical engineering to join the family's steel manufacturing business - didn't quite see the world the same way they did. ""We had all only heard of night blindness,"" says Rakesh, who was diagnosed with colour blindness. ""It was as if the world blacked out for me,"" says the engineer, who realised he won't be able to gauge the differences in metal at various stages of steel processing and would have to kiss goodbye to his dream.A resident of a small city in North India, Rakesh is now sitting in a family-run medical centre in Chembur where hope has drawn him. Though there is no known cure for colour blindness, he wants to believe in the clinic's claim of reversing fate within months. Here, in a test that asked Rakesh to pick up two matching crayons and draw parallel lines with them, there is a green line next to a red one. Previously, a doctor he approached had compared the retina to a TV with three antennae - red, blue and green. ""If one of them doesn't work, it could damage how you see all shades,"" the doctor had told Rakesh who suffered from red-green colour blindness, the most common variant. He often tries hard to recall if he ever painted skin blue or mixed colours wrong in art class but only ends up confused. Someone up there had messed with his antennae but, to him, the transmission always felt normal.Globally, nature is known to fiddle with the colour palettes of one out of every 12 men and one of 200 women. While describing this genetic condition, doctors are wary of using the word 'blindness' and prefer 'deficiency'. ""It's not that patients cannot see colour at all,"" says opthalmologist Kavindra Rajoria. ""Due to deficient photo-receptors, they are not able to see certain hues and tell the difference between them."" Among the visuals explaining what the world looks like to patients, a local clinic uses a Tom and Jerry screen grab in which both cat and mouse look jaundiced. ""It's like tone-deafness,"" says a colour-blind musician in the international short 'No Such Thing As Color'. ""Colour is an artefact of perceptions. Who's to say what you are seeing is really the colour you say it is?"" he rationalises.Philosophy, however, is a poor comforter for patients in India, who grapple with a bleak future. It isn't until later in life, when they appear for medical tests for government jobs that most Indian men realise they have a problem and many have to abandon dreams of joining the army, navy, aviation or jobs involving chemicals or colours. For 26-year-old Sarvesh, who grew up in Jabalpur and now lives in Mumbai, the verdict came in 2005 when he couldn't pass the medical test for aviation in India. ""Before that, I had been flying in Australia on a pilot's license,"" says the well-built pilot, who was forced to look for new career options on moving back to his home country. ""I don't know why India sees it as an impediment for pilots. There have been no accidents in Australia and in fact, during World War II, colourblind people were used in spy planes as they could see contours better,"" says Sarvesh, who usually boasts a thick skin but recalls not being able to laugh off deliberately-posed questions like: ""Can you get that blue bag for us?""While coping with the invisible condition, desperation takes over. ""Many break down,"" says opthalmologist K K Goyal, recalling a phone call from Kerala at two in the night. ""I am going to commit suicide,"" said a despondent man who had spent nearly Rs 30 lakh on aviation training before the diagnosis clipped his wings. Goyal has also met patients from small villages who have sold their lands for the sake of education.Problems could range from everyday situations such as not being able to see the queen on a carrom board to not being able to read traffic lights. Besides an aspiring cricketer who complained that he could not see the ball, Goyal has also come across an exporter of green tomatoes in Gujarat whose business suffered because of his deficiency. ""If there happened to be a red tomato in a vehicle full of green ones, his eyes would see the entire cart of tomatoes as red,"" says Goyal.Many prefer hiding the deficiency from the world like stutterers, some fear it hurting marriage prospects and others hate the questions. ""People's usual reaction,"" says 28-yearold Pradeep, ""is to point at things like walls and bedsheets and ask what colour they are."" For this Delhi-based power system consultant, the diagnosis in 2009 brought with it genuine confusion. Today, he has learnt to be smarter.

Someone told him that wearing glasses of the colour that poses a problem would help but he has yet to try it.In retrospect, Rakesh, clinging to hope at a Mumbai clinic says he would have studied chartered accountancy if he had discovered his problem earlier.

A survey of the area did not yield any sign of the leaf miner, said the scientist. However, he said that scientists were on the lookout for any isolated case.The pest is reported to have originated in Latin America and spread through infected fruits and packaging materials to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The pest is crossing borders and devastating tomato production in both protected and open fields, said Dhana Raj Boina of the National Institute of Plant Health Management, Hyderabad, in a recent presentation before a group of scientists from Kerala.Given its aggressive nature and crop destruction potential, it has quickly become a key pest of concern everywhere, he said. The pest was detected in October 2014 in Pune, Maharashtra, and was then reported from Karnataka.Director of the Bangalore-based National Bureau of Agricultural Insect Resources Abraham Vergese said that tuta absoluta had mostly been found in tomato in India. About 90 per cent of the cases have been in the particular crop. However, he said, it could also infect crops like brinjal and potato and had been found in these crops though on a smaller scale.His advice to Kerala farmers is not to import saplings since Karnataka has already confirmed presence of the pest.

The Australian weather office said on Tuesday that most of the subcontinent can expect good rainfall this week and that the monsoon would move northwards.Vegetable production has suffered because the absence of pre-monsoon showers prolonged the hot weather and created a water scarcity, particularly in parts of western, northern and central India where rainfall was 60-100% below average.As a result, tomato prices have doubled to Rs 80 per kg in many parts of southern India and Maharashtra but onions are down 21% from last year, while wheat and rice have risen only marginally.Lower production during 2015-16, a drought year, has affected the market sentiment for corn, cotton and pulses like chana, urad and tur. ""Maize prices will remain bullish till October,"" said Rajiv Yadav, vice-president (grains and oilseeds), Noble Agri. The industry has approached the government demanding duty-free import of maize.Traders say they are preparing to import wheat as production may be 10 million tonnes lower than official estimates, but the agriculture ministry officials disagree and stand by their comforting estimate of 94 million tonnes. Sugar prices are also likely to remain firm at Rs 40 per kg due to the big fall in area under sugarcane in Maharashtra. High prices of pulses also have a positive impact as it is likely to encourage much higher sowing by farmers, leading to a better supply situation later on, traders said.Data from the weather office shows the monsoon should have reached Bihar by June 10 and touched eastern UP and northern parts of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh by June 15. But it has so far only reached Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh as it stagnated after striking Kerala and Tamil Nadu a week late.Crop planting is 7% lower than last year, according to government data, but sowing will rapidly accelerate once the monsoon reaches parched northern and western regions. Madan Sabnavis , chief economist at CARE ratings, said the situation was not worrisome as of now but he would worry if the trend continues because farmers may shift from rice to pulses or from pulses to oilseeds.""If it goes into July, definitely there is cause for concern because what happens is that when the monsoon comes in late, there's a tendency for farmers to switch crops ... That's where the danger lies... one has to be on guard in terms of the distribution of the rainfall across geographies as well as distribution across the three crops,"" he said.Certain regions of peninsular India, like coastal Andhra Pradesh, have received rainfall in excess of the norm by 89%.

Here is the complete transcript of thewith Arnab Goswami.Prime Minister Modi thank you very much for this interview. Thank you very muchMy greetings to all the peopleThis is your first one to one interview to a private news channel since you became Prime Minister. And if I am not mistaken, this is the first ever interview by a sitting Prime Minister of India to a private television news channel in the country. So I would first like to thank you and am very grateful for the opportunity.The world of the media has grown so big that everybody has to attach themselves with it.I am very grateful and our viewers will be very grateful also Mr Modi because they want to hear your views on a range of subjects. Mr Prime Minister I would like to start by taking you back to 20th May 2014. The results came on May 16th. Four days later, you gave a historic speech in the Central Hall of Parliament and you were speaking to the members of Parliament. You had said four days after the results that an era of responsibility has begun. And that you said that in 2019 before the elections, I will come back to this Parliament, I will come back to the MPs and I will give my report card. Forty percent into your tenure, how much have you achieved of your own targets?When I went for the first time as an MP to the Central Hall, and it was the first time I was seeing the Central Hall. I had not been there before. So I had then said that becoming the Prime Minister was not about the designation of the office but it was about the responsibilities and work of being a PM. I had also said that my government would be committed to the poor. I was completely new in the job. Delhi was new for me. The Delhi environment was new to me. The work of the government of India was also new for me. But despite that, in such a short time, the pace at which the country has moved forward, and it's not on one subject. You can pick up any aspect of the government's functioning, and if you make a comparison with the past governments, then you will realize that no issue has been ignored. There has been an effort to bring in something new in every area. There is an effort to bring in change in every area. One big challenge was that I was not experienced about this place, I had not even been an MP. The office was new, the questions were also new. But when I look at the second biggest challenge, we should remember those days when the country was engulfed in disappointment. The everyday news was about whether there would be any electricity production after seven days, whether coal would be supplied or not. This was the situation then. The entire system was engulfed in disappointment. The big challenge was to inject new trust into the system and create confidence among the citizens. It is very difficult to evaluate this from the outside but I have gone through it. But today I can say with a lot of satisfaction that now there is no trace of any disappointment. The intention to do something is visible. And it's not in words but in actual achievement. I had said that within a given timeframe, we will open bank accounts for the poor. For something that had not been done for 60 years, setting a timeframe for it was in itself a risk. But because of that a trust was created in the system that it was something doable. So that's the process I started for awakening the confidence. And today you can see that in every sector, the changed circumstances can be seen. While evaluating the performance of this government, never forget that you will have to make that evaluation in comparison with the 10 years of the previous government. Only then will you know where we were and where we are now. We should not be talking about what we are aiming for. For now you will have to assess the present in comparison with the immediate past and in that you will find a bright futureMr. Modi, I want to start now on the issue of foreign policy. In the area of foreign policy, you have taken great personal interest. The amount of personal interest you have shown in foreign policy, probably none of the previous Prime Ministers showed the same kind of interest. Your approach is pro active. What I find interesting about your foreign policy is that you have balanced different powers and different interests. On the one side, your relationship with US, you made sure that India enters the Missile Control Technology Regime with them. A week before that you also signed the historic Chabahar Port Agreement with Iran. So, you have balanced very diverse forces. My question to you over this is that, is it easy to do that as an Indian Prime Minister? Secondly, on the issue of the NSG, you staked a lot of personal interest, personal push, you lobbied actively. How close are we to getting the NSG seat?Firstly, about foreign policy, you need to know what has strengthened our foreign policy. For 30 years, in our country, the government was unstable. For 30 years, party with a clear mandate wasn't given the opportunity to form the government. The world measures the government of a nation on the basis of its condition in its own country, on how strong their word is in their own country. I am thankful to the people of this country, that after 30 years, they chose a government with absolute majority and this has had an impact on world politics. Countries and world leaders have changed their perspective towards India. This is the biggest benefit. Secondly, the world didn't know me. The world wants to know who the head of the state is. If someone would want to know Modi through the eyes of the media, then he would be disillusioned on which modi is the real Modi. If this happens, the country will be at a loss. Modi's personality shouldn't be a hindrance for the world to have faith in india. But for that unless I meet all those leaders and engage them them one to one, unless I speak to them frankly, they wouldn't know about india's head of state, so it was very important for me as I am not from a political family. I never had the opportunity to meet the world leaders earlier.You were an unknown entity in foreign policyMore than foreign policy it was foreign relations. Yes, I was new to it. So for me, being pro active was mandatory. Thirdly, we work as a team. Foreign ministry, Prime Minister's officer, commerce ministry, finance ministry, defense minister, everyone works as a team, not as separate pieces. The impact that is now visible, is not just because of Modi, it is because of the team. All teams work in a particular direction. That is why the impact is seen, earlier these teams were splintered. We have seen instances where the party would give a statement, the prime minister would say something else, party leaders would say something else. This disunity has had a negative impact. Thirdly, we also need to understand that earlier the world was bi polar. Foreign policy would be centered around two super powers. India was a little late in realizing that this bi polar situation was for namesake. Now the entire world, in changed circumstances, especially in 21st century, it is more interdependent and inter connected, earlier, the foreign policy was possible between governments, but today it is not possible just between governments. Government relations are important but increasing people to people contact is equally important. There's been a shift in paradigm. Because I do not have any previous baggage, because I've had a clean slate, I write everything from beginning and that has a benefit. Today we are building relations with countries across the world. The amount of respect with which I engage saudi arabia, I engage Iran with the same amount of respect. The amount of respect with which I speak to America, I speak to russia with the same amount of respect. So we need to understand this. We also need to understand that we shouldn't consider smaller countries insignificant. I abide by this principle. The small countries of the world are as important as the big nations. We had assumed that the relations with smaller nations would develop under the shadow of the bigger nations. I brought about a change in this. You must have seen that I made a forum for the pacific island nations. We have had two meetings. I went there once and they came here once. These are small countries with a population of about 10 lakh or 20 lakh. But these small island nations are most affected by global warming. When india took up the international solar mission and 122 nations joined it, the island nations benefitted the most out of it. They are 50 in number now. A group of 50 nations, feels secured with this vision of India. If we try to understand this change, then we would realize that in the world, a few days back, I was sitting with the officers of our foreign services, so as we got talking, in a very poetic way I told them that there was a time when we used to sit by the sea and count the waves, but the time has now changed, we are done counting waves, now it's time for us to steer ourselves, ride the waves and decide on our direction, destination and speedThat is apparent. You have a very aggressive foreign policy. But my second question was, you put so much effort for NSG membership. My question was, how close are we to NSG membership and were you disappointed that we did not make it at the very end because of China's opposition?Look the first thing is that India has been continuously making these efforts, no matter which government was in office. Be it the membership of the UN Security Council or the SCO membership or MTCR membership or NSG membership. Every government has made an effort. It's not that only this government is trying, it's in continuity. But it's during our tenure that we achieved SCO membership, we also got the MTCR membership. I have full faith that now we have begun a coordinated effort for the NSG membership too. The process has begun on a positive note. Everything has rules and will work accordingly and move forwardIs it the problem of mindset with China? There have been 13 engagements at various levels between the Narendra Modi government and the Chinese government. The latest engagement was when you went to Tashkent. You spent some time with the Chinese President Xi Jinping. Yet it was seen that in the case of Masood Azhar, China blocked India's UN bid to ban him. Now they have stalled India's NSG bid. Why is China repeatedly blocking us Mr Prime Minister despite your personal proactive measures and your government's outreach?The first thing is that we have an ongoing dialogue with China and it should continue to happen. In foreign policy it's not necessary to have similar views to have a conversation. Even when the views are contradictory, talks are the only way forward and problems should be resolved through dialogue. We don't have one problem with China, we have a whole lot of problems pending with China. Slowly and steadily, an effort is on to address these issues through talks and make them less cumbersome. I can say that China has been cooperating with India to search for solutions. On some issues, it's a question of principles for them. On some issues, it's a question of principles for us. On some issues they differ with us and there are issues on which we differ with them. There are some basic differences. But the most important thing is that we can speak to China eye-to-eye and put forth India's interests in the most unambiguous manner. We are a government that takes care of India's interests. We don't compromise on this. Three days ago I met the Chinese President. I told him clearly about India's interests. They are a different country, we are a different countryDo you think you will be able to change their mindset on the issue of NSG membership?See the foreign policy is not about changing mindsets. Foreign policy is about finding the common meeting points. Where do our interests converge and how much? We have to sit and talk with every country. It's our ongoing effortThis statement that you just made is also apt in the context of America where you gave a speech in the U.S Congress. By the way Mr Prime Minister it was a fantastic speechThank youThere was a lot of humour. You were laughing and cracking jokes while you delivered the speech which was very unique. They also appreciated it. Was the speech impromptu?I have a humourous side but these days humour can be a risky thingWhy do you say that?In this era of 24/7 news channels, anybody can lift a small word and make a big issue out of it. But I will tell you the truth, the reason for the absence of humour in public life is this fear. I am myself scared . Earlier when I used to make speeches, I would make it so humourous but there would never be any issuesHave you become more conscious now?I am not conscious. I am in fear, there is no humour left in public life because of this fear. Everyone is scared. I am in fear. My speeches used be humourous. I see it in Parliament, that humour is finished there too. It is a matter of concern. I will quote one proverb.Yes, go ahead.Even if you mention a proverb, they will connect it with something else and begin a conversation. The one who is saying the proverb does not know for what he is speaking.But you should not lose your sense of humour Mr Prime MinisterBut it is true that my trip to the United States of America, my speech in their Congress and the respect shown towards India created a lot of hype. Had it not been hyped so much, there would not have been so much criticism on the NSG issue. Government is being criticized not for any mishandling of the NSG issue but because we were so successful over there (in the USA)Did China become conscious of your growing friendship with US?I am talking about what's happening hereBut when you delivered that speech in context of America, you used a very interesting phrase. You said 'We have to overcome the hesitations of history'. My Hindi is not that good. Like hesitations of history. But my question to you is Mr Prime Minister, how close can we get to America because many Indians believe that America is still supporting Pakistan, giving them military assistance. How close can we get? At what point do we stop before we are seen like an American ally? What is your own world view on that?I would especially like to appeal to my country's media that we should stop looking at everything in India from the. India is an independent country. It is a country of 125 crore people. Whenever it approaches any country, it will only be concerned about its own interests. It has been our biggest shortcoming and mistake that we have been tagging ourselves with another country and trying to do things. We are an independent country, we have our own policies and future. We have to think about the future of our 125 crore people. There should be no compromise on our interests. We have relations with America in the context of these fundamental pointsHow close can we get to them?There has been warmth in our relationship. You must have seen the editorials in American newspapers after my visit to that country. One point mentioned in those editorials was that the success of Obama's foreign policy has been the warm relationship with India. This has been saidWhat you are saying Modiji is that we can be close to America but we need not be an ally or seen to be an ally?The first thing is that we no longer live in a bipolar world. The world is interconnected and interdependent. You will have to connect with everybody at the same time. Even if there are two opposing countries, they will have to be friends. Now the times have changedMr Modi, on 8th May 2014, I had the opportunity to interview you, the interview took place in Ahmedabad, I think one last phase of elections was left. We were discussing the issue of Pakistan. You have had an uncompromising approach towards Pakistan. Two days back, Lashkar E Toiba killed 8 CRPF jawans in an attack. In the 8th May interview, you put forth a very interesting phrase, you said 'Can talks be heard amidst the noise of bombs, guns and pistols?' This is how you had phrased it. Do you believe we have been too generous towards Pakistan? Do you believe we have been too generous towards Pakistan?There are two things. One - India has always wanted friendly ties with its neighbours, there can be no debate around it. We want to live in harmony and peace. And I have said it repeatedly, that India has to fight poverty, Pakistan too has to fight poverty, why don't we come together to fight poverty? I said this before elections and during election campaigns. Also I had invited leaders of SAARC nations to my swearing in ceremony and they had attended it as well. So there has been no change in our intent, our thoughts and our current behaviour. Number two - those who have to work from the table, will work from the table and those who have to work at the border, will work at border with full strength. Each one will fulfill the responsibility entrusted to them. And our jawans are fulfilling their responsibilities. It's true that pressure on terrorists has increased, their schemes are proving unsuccessful. The intent with which they move forward are foiled and they have to face major challenges. It is because of this disappointment that such incidents are taking place and our jawans are risking their lives and protecting the country. We are very proud of our JawansWhen your foreign policy is studied, observers analyze what's happening and what's not happening. If you give me the opportunity, I want to do a bit of analyses. There was a terrific pace of engagement with Pakistan between October, November and December. On 30th November, you met Nawaz Sharif on the sidelines (of UN Climate Summit in Paris). Both of you were seated on a sofa, talking to each other. A lot of people were speculating the contents of your conversation. This was on the sidelines of Climate Summit. After that, all of a sudden within seven days there were NSA level talks and Ajit Doval spoke to Nasir Janjua in Bangkok. And again after that you went to Russia via Afghanistan, you made an unexpected visit to Nawaz Sharif in Lahore. It was a personal trip but it still had some level of importance. Eight days later, Pakistani terrorists attacked Pathankot. Can you tell our viewers whether Pakistan was proactively responding in the months of October, November and December? Did the Pathankot terror attack change the situation? Is it true that Pakistan was making a lot of movement in those three months?Look there are different types of forces operating in Pakistan. But the government only engages with a democratically elected system. Our effort for that engagement is continuing. But our supreme objective is peace. Our supreme objective is to protect India's interests. We keep making effort toward that objective and sometimes our efforts are successful. As far as meetings and talks are concerned, we signalled right from the day I took oath and sent invitations for the oath taking ceremony, that we seek friendly relations but without compromising on our interests. And that is why I have said that my country's soldiers have full freedom to answer back in whatever manner they have to and they will keep doing thatMr Prime Minister what is the 'Lakshman Rekha' that you would draw when it comes to Pakistan. There is some confusion surrounding this subject. I would like you to give an elaborate reply. In 2014, it was believed that if talks are being held, then they should be held between two countries and not with Hurriyat. It should be between the government of India and the government of Pakistan. The other 'Lakshman Rekha' is that you must act on 26/11. There's been no forward movement so far. The third thing is about forward movement on the Pathankot attack case. So what is the 'Lakshman Rekha' now and if Pakistan remains within those bounds, so talks can happen at the political level or at any other level?The first thing is that with Pakistan, to whom do we talk to decide about the 'Lakshman Rekha'. Will it be with the elected government or with other actors? That is why India will have to be on alert all the time. India will have to be alert every moment. There can never be any laxity in this. But there is an outcome due to my continuous efforts like my visit to Lahore and my invitation to the Pakistani Prime Minister to come to India. Now I don't have to explain to the world about India's position. The world is unanimously appreciating India's position. And the world is seeing that Pakistan is finding it difficult to respond. If we had become an obstacle, then we would have had to explain to the world that we are not that obstacle. Now we don't have to explain to the world. The world knows our intentions. Like on the issue of terrorism, the world never bought India's theory on terrorism. They would sometime dismiss it by saying that it's your law and order problem. Today the world has to accept what India has been saying about terrorism. India's dialogue on terrorism, the losses India has suffered due to terrorism, the losses suffered by humanity, the world is now acknowledging that. So I believe we have to take this process forwardMr Prime Minister I now want to move to questions on the economy. In the past two years you have started many schemes. If we look at the theme of Jan Dhan Yojna for financial inclusion, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna for crop insurance, Swach Bharat, Skill India, Make In India. If we see the theme running through these schemes, is your social agenda at the core of your personal economic philosophy, social transformation? Is the social agenda at the core of your economic philosophy as the Prime Minister?The first point is our philosophy is to reach the last man in the line. Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay's philosophy forms the core of our political, economic and social ideology. And even Mahatma Gandhi used to say that what is there for the last man? So my development parameter is very simple. It is about how the poorest of the poor can benefit from development. The poor is the central focus of my economic agenda. The poor should be strengthened in such a way that they get the willingness to defeat poverty. By helping the poor make ends meet while they remain in poverty is also one of the ways. I am not saying right or wrong but it's one of the ways. But today the country's situation is such that we should make the poor strong so that they become partners in defeating poverty. All these schemes are meant to empower the poor and change the quality of life. The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna is not only about opening bank accounts for the poor. Because of this the poor are feeling that they are becoming a part of the country's economic system. The bank that he was seeing from afar, now he is able to enter that bank. This brings about a psychological transformation. Looked at in another way, did you ever imagine that 40 thousand crores could be injected into the banking system by contributions from the poor. The poor who never had bank accounts, have deposited 100 rupees, 50 rupees or 200 rupees. It means that poor man saved 100 rupees and the change began in his life. We have taken up construction of toilets. I had gone to Chhattisgarh and had the opportunity to get the blessings of one mother. An adivasi mother heard about the scheme for building toilets. She sold her four goats and built a toilet. That 90 old mother uses a walking stick and goes around the cluster of 30 or 40 houses in the tribal village and has been spreading the message to build toilets. This change is becoming the reason for the change in the quality of life. I have begun the cleanliness campaign. It's estimated an individual spends an average of 7000 rupees for treatment of a disease. The main reason for disease is filth. The poor suffer the most from the filth. If a poor man falls sick, he cannot drive his rickshaw for two days and his children go hungry. So how can we help the poor bring about change in their lives? Now there is a neo-middle class and a middle class in the country. The young have their aspirations. So another aspect of my policies you must have seen are the Start Up India, Stand Up India, Seaport activity, port activity, railways expansion, railway station upgradation. These changes directly appeal to the middle class. The middle class has its aspirations. We have to create jobs? How will job creation happen? Till I invest in the development of infrastructure, there be no job creation. You must have seen that the maximum electricity generation since Independence has occurred this year. The maximum amount of coal mined has been in this year. The maximum length of roads being constructed daily is happening in this year. The fastest loading and unloading of steamers at sea ports is happening now. All these changes are creating opportunities for employment like in Start up India, Stand Up India. For instance in Stand Up India, I have said that every bank should give an economic opportunity to one woman, one dalit or one tribal person to become entrepreneurs. This will create many job opportunities. So this is the basis of my economic philosophy.Mr Prime Minister if I could interrupt you on this. On the one hand is the people's expectations and on the other is your vision. Many programs that you have mentioned, you can't put a calendar date to it but they don't have an immediate impact. They maybe able to show results in 3, 4, 5 maybe beyond 5 years. Now there are challenges in that. Mr Prime Minister, you are aware more than anyone else that people want immediate results. Now you spoke of job creation. The first thing, as an achievement you have managed to grow the economy at 7.5 per cent when the global economic climate is very bleak. You have spoken about it as well. You have met fiscal deficit targets, FDI inflows have increased but people are saying that job opportunities are not increasing. You have spoken about infrastructure but the current rate of unemployment. Mr Prime Minister, the latest Labour Bureau figures, is it a source of concern for you as the Prime Minister?The first thing is that are 800 million people below the age of 35 in our country. We have to accept that the demand for jobs is very high. But where will they get employment? Investment will come in. It will be used in the infrastructure sector, manufacturing and services sector. Now like the initiative we have taken, we have started the Mudra Yojna. More than three crore people in the country comprise washermen, barbers, milkman, newspaper vendors, cart vendors. We have given them nearly 1.25 lakh crore rupees without any guarantee. Now why have these people taken the money? To expand their work. When he expands his work, if he is currently employing one person, now he has to employ two people. If there were two employed earlier, now there are three. Now just think, when 3 crore of these small businesses have got access to finance, they must have expanded their work. Now all this is not in the Labour Department's registration. Three crore people have expanded their work. We took another small decision. The big malls in the country run 365 days a year but the smaller shops have to close on holidays. We announced in the Budget that even a small shopkeeper can operate his shop till late night and that too on all the seven days of the week. If the malls don't have restrictions then why should the small shopkeepers have restrictions. So now if a shopkeeper operates his shop till late and on all seven days, if he earlier employed one person, now he will have to employ two people. So won't the employment increase?So is your focus on entrepreneurship?Our focus is on all aspects. Now we are saying that by 2022 we want to ensure that everyone has a house. Housing sector has the maximum potential for creating employment. Houses will be built in such huge numbers, how many people will get employment? You must have seen that last year we brought in a textile policy. Under this textile policy, there will be income tax benefits for those who create employment. The more employment one creates, the more tax benefits they will get. For the first time, employment generation and tax has been linked. These are the things that boost employment and our central focus is creating employment for the ordinary citizenMr Prime Minister, questions are also being raised on food inflation which has still not decreased. The expectation was that the food inflation would decline. The people had put their hopes on the Prime Minister that you will bring down prices. This not only has a political impact but also has a social impact. Over the past two weeks, there were reports that in some places the price of Arhar dal had touched 150 rupees and 200 rupees for other pulses. The price of tomatoes was also rising. Is this only seasonal because the food inflation is increasing at 7.5 per cent year on year. Global oil prices have fallen. Do you think this creates perception issues for your government?You can't view inflation as a perception issue. Price rise should be seen as a reality. What is available for a consumer should be seen for what it is. There should never be an attempt to view price rise as a perception issue as a means of escaping the reality of price rise. We will have to accept reality. You see the fast pace at which prices were rising under the previous government, today that speed has decelerated a lot. You can see the statistics, you will find it there. Second, the country has gone through two consecutive years of severe drought. Drought has a direct impact on the price of vegetables, food and pulses because all these things are produced from the soil. Now when there is such a big drought, it's not in anybody's hands. The second option in such a situation is imports. The Indian government has imported pulses in huge quantities. Third, it is the joint responsibility of the state and Central governments. It is not exclusively the state's responsibility. It is not exclusively the Centre's responsibility. It is the joint responsibility of both the state and Central governments. This should not be an issue of blame game that the state government did not do certain things and that the Centre did not do certain things. But it will have to be agreed that it is the joint responsibility of both. That is why the Centre has given rights to the states to make stringent laws. How much stocks to keep or not to keep are decisions which the states can take. All these rights have been given to the states. Some states have performed well, some states are trying. But the Centre and state governments are trying to work together on this. I believe that we have been successful to the extent that the speed with which prices were rising (under UPA), what would have happened if the prices were to rise at that speed. We have been successful in stopping that speedy rise of prices. But as far as pulses are concerned, production in India has been very low. Many farmers who were earlier sowing pulses have started cultivating sugar. That is also an area of concern. We gave special incentives for pulses. We have tried to set up a different MSP for pulses. We have taken steps to procure pulses from farmers with bonus. Our focus is on increasing the production of pulses. We are also focusing on building stocks of pulses by importing from abroad. An all out effort is being made and I believe that nobody doubts the sincerity of this governmentMr Prime Minister what is your view about the controversy around the exit of Raghuram Rajan as the RBI Governor? A lot has been spoken about this. There was commentary that it may effect India's image, perception as a global economy. What's your own view of the controversy around the exit of Raghuram Rajan?When my Government was formed in May 2014, you take newspapers from May, June, July 2014 and check television debates during that period. The topic of the television debates would be - Will the new govt let Raghuram Rajan continue? Or Will the new Government oust Raghuram Rajan? And there was more or less consensus that he was appointed by the previous govt and so Modi won't let him complete his tenure and will remove him. You have seen, that he worked his entire tenure. For the time he was appointed by the previous government, he completing his entire term. So all the misconceptions have been dispelled. Secondly, according to my 2 year experience in Govt, those who are creating controversies, are being unjust to Raghuram RajanWhy so?I will tell you. Those who say...I believe Raghuram Rajan's patriotism is no less than any of ours. It will be doing injustice to him if one says that he will serve the country only if he is at a particular post. As much as I know Raghuram Rajan, whatever post he holds, wherever he is, he is someone who will continue to serve the country. He is someone who loves his country. Therefore, it's not like the nation won't get Raghuram Rajan's services, Raghuram Rajan is not that kind of a person. He is a person who loves the country. Those who speak such language are doing great injustice to him. My experience with him has been good.I appreciate the work he has done. And my good wishes will always be with himPrime Minister Modi, there's a question related to this. During your speech at the Executive you used seven words begining with letter 'S'-- 'Sevabhaav' (service), 'Santulan' (balance), 'Sanyam' (restraint), 'Samvaad' (dialogue), 'Samanvay' (coordination), 'Sakaratmak' (positivity) and 'Samvedna' (sensitivity). I will ask the question in context with Raghuram Rajan because you used these words in the speech at National Executive Meet speech on June 14 in Allahabad. You said, 'Our party leaders and party workers should use these qualities in their daily dealings and behaviour.' Prime Minister, in Raghuram Rajan's context, your Rajya Sabha MP has made many comments. Later he made critical remarks against senior bureaucrats. My question is, do you think it is right? When we talk about 'Sanyam' (restraint) and 'Santulan' (balance), is it correct?Whether it is someone from my party or not, I believe that such things are inappropriate. The nation won't benefit from such publicity stunts. One should be more responsible while conducting themselves. Anyone who believes he is bigger than the system is wrong.That's a very clear message.I have a very clear message. I have no two minds about it.And Mr Prime Minister, if I may say so, between May 8 and now, you are speaking as straight as you did before you took over as Prime Minister. I think that answer takes me to the next subject. Mr Prime Minister, the issue is that of Black Money. In a very interersting way you said, prices should not be looked at from the point of percepetion, equally, Mr Prime Minister it can be said said that an issue like Black Money should not be looked at in terms of perception, but it is perception forming. There are political debates on this. Experts say that the Black Money economy has shrunk, 10-15% economy has shrunk through land dealings and other things. You have passed the Black Money Bill, you have made taxation more transparent, you have started information sharing with other countries, you have taken steps, but Prime Minister Modi, people still expect that a Rs 25 lakh crores will be brought back and put into their bank accounts. How will you address that expectation? The hope that people have taking Black Money, how will you address it?How did the black money issue arise and how did it become such a serious issue? We have to look at the background. It is an established fact in the minds of the common man those who steal money park their money overseas. It's a common perception. Even if I look at it from the common man's perspective, I also wonder where does this money go? This issue was always stalled in the Parliament. When the matter reached the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court ordered Special Investigation Team to look into it, even then the previous government stalled it for three years, from 2011-2014. It's after this that political parties, the media and the common man started believing that there's something wrong. Then the issue of Black Money became an agenda. Even today I can say...that yes, when there is money stashed in foreign accounts, there are some norms of engagement with foreign countries on the issue. But between 2011-2014, these people were given the opportunity to launder money here and thereAnd you also said on 17 February 2015 on this issue, that the then Law Minister is only offering lip serviceThe result was that people got several chances to launder money. Secondly, after our Government was formed, the first decision taken by our Cabinet was to form a Special Investigation Team to bring back Black Money which was pending despite Supreme Court's 2011 order. This shows our sincerity. From then on, you can't imagine how stringent the laws have been made to bring back Black Money and whoever comes in its fold will know how strict the law is. Thirdly, I attended the G20 Summit. Never was Black Money issue discussed in the G20 forum. It was my first G20 summit, for the first time I met the world leaders. And for the first time in the G20 Summit, one paragraph was on unaccounted money, on black money and 20 countries said that the world should cooperateBlack. The dirty money, black money was also linked to terrorism, an environment of global census was created. We have been signing agreements one after the other with different countries that there will be real time, automatic exchange of information with India. I recently visited Switzerland and there was minimal discussion on the issue. But after I returned, a big delegation from Switzerland visited India, and they held meeting with the Indian Government and we discussed...for several years, we believed that Switzerland is the place where black money is stashed, that country is holding discussions to come to a consensus on Automatic Information Exchange and if we reach consensus it will be a great achievement. Thirdly you must've seen that Mauritius route came up in almost everything. It was said that money goes out of India and returns through the Mauritius route. This was discussed. Everyone thought that nothing can be done about the Mauritius route.But our Government held a dialogue with the Mauritius Government, made changes to the old treaty. And we successfully made a new treaty to block the money which comes through the Mauritius route and very soon it will be phased out and completed. All these decisions are taken to fight the Black Money menace. This is not a one sided fight. Secondly, the govt is working in a direction to make sure that Black Money isn't generated in India and black Money doesn't go out of India, you can see the results of all this.When the opposition raises the Rs 15 lakh issue.That is something the opposition raises during elections. Let them have some issue to talk aboutMr Prime Minister, there has been no major financial corruption or scam in your tenure in the last two years. Perception is again, what people say is because you keep a very tight control on the reins of Government but the question is there are people, who are wilful defaulters, the economic offenders who take a lot of money from the country or commit economic offences in the country, go overseas and use rules and use lawyers, and they don't come back to India. And people are asking now, is the Narendra Modi Govt determined to take these cases of wilful defaulters and economic offenders to their logical conclusion.Firstly, this question is not in the minds of people. The people of India have confidence that if there's someone who can do this, it is Narendra Modi and he will do it. Citizens of the country have full faith.Does it worry you, that people have misued the law?I take this as an opportunity and I will show them what the law is.Mr. Modi, there have been several corruption cases about the previous government, which have now come out. There is AgustaWestland, many defense scams and defense transactions are now being analyzed seriously. The cases which were quoted in the CAG reports but were ignored are now coming in the forefront. This question is important because this isn't just about financial corruption but these questions have direct implications on the national security of the country. Do you think, when they say that this is a political witch hunt by Narendra Modi Sarkar, do you think all of these cases would have been possible without political patronage?There are many things which are not visible. One can't imagine the difficulty I am experiencing in taking out things from dirt. One who is working there knows the amount of dirt that exists and how certain things have been caught in a web. There are certain powers behind it. The case about Agusta helicopters. I can't deny it and I believe that we have the right to doubt that people behind this are very experienced. They have perfectly practiced the art of doing wrong deeds. They are very experienced and knowledgeable. And one can also smell the fact that such a thing wouldn't have been done without a shield. Now, agencies are probing. Let's see how far the probe goes. But the investigation shouldn't go ahead while people are being targeted, neither does my government target anyone. The sin has been committed, but how much is done, How was it done, who did it, probe agencies will find out in a professional way. Whatever comes out, will be put outPrime Minister, talking about your speech in the US Congress, and the humour that you displayed. I felt some of it was impromptu. But the Americans were able to relate to what you said, I don't remember the exact words, you said, I am informed that the working of the US Congress is harmonious. And then there was a pause and people were laughing. Then you said, 'I am told' - You emphasized and said 'I am told that you are well known for your bipartisanship.' Then the applause was more. And then you said, 'You are not alone. Time and again I have witnessed a similar spirit in the Indian Parliament.' You spoke about a serious topic in a interesting manner. You referred to the Upper House. There was a lot of response on that too. Your humour was really appreciated and I think it was a wonderful moment when you were speaking. But, Mr. Prime Minister, when you look back at the parliament, this question comes to many people's minds, has Prime Minister Narendra Modi being held back from achieving his own objectives because of the non-stop parliamentary logjam. How much has this affected his moving towards his own targets? If you critically analyze this situation, do you feel your government could have been more consultative or do you feel the blame is entirely with the Opposition?I look at it differently. I believe there have been a lot of problems. Whether the fault is ours or their's, I 'll leave it to the people. People will decide. But because of discussions in Parliament - we may not come to a decision, the decision could be opposing our view, nothing wrong in that. But at least there should be a discussion. The sad part is, if somebody is running away from debate or don't let discussions happen, then it is a cause of worry in a democracy. Whether the government's work is accomplished or not, I don't see it as a cause of worry. If not today, it will happen tomorrow. There are certain things which will happen at an administrative level. The big thing is, Parliament is for discussion. Parliament is to show dissent. Parliament is to give an argument for one's opposition, to present an argument when they support.To uphold this basic spirit of Parliament, is the responsibility of every person who values democracy. It is the responsibility of those present in the Parliament and those outside. It is the responsibility of those in power and those not in power. This is a matter of spirit and it should be followed. As far as the government is concerned, on every issue and at every forum, we have tried to hold discussions. I myself have met the opposition leaders and spoken to them. Key members of the government are also in touch. And you must have seen that many issues have been resolved. In the last session, we have passed 12 bills in Rajya Sabha, we passed 10 bills in the Lok Sabha. So the pace has picked up. When people say 'Opposition', it is unfair to the opposition. There are some parties in the Parliament which are not with the BJP or NDA, but are with the government on key decisions. So, to defame the Opposition by saying that all opposition parties are against us -- when some people do this, it is wrong. There is one party which has problems. And the whole world knows that party. Secondly, to say that 'When you were is Opposition, you did it this way' There is a difference between every Opposition party. 'We have run the government for 60 years and now we are in the Opposition, so we know the nitty-gritties of the government, we know the responsibilities. We can't behave in the way, a new Opposition party behaves.' A party which hasn't been in power or hasn't seen anything, could behave in this way. For example, we are in power now, and consider in 2040 we become the Opposition party. So, in 2040 we can't have the same conduct as the one we had in 2009 or 2010.Congress is a very experienced and old partyThat's why I say that, those who have been in power for so many years, shouldn't be doing this. If there is a new party in the Opposition, they have a small demand for their state or if an MP has a demand for his/her constituency and does something like this, then we can understand. Ones who have been in power for very long, shouldn't be doing such thingsPrime Minister Modi, do you think the GST bill which has been stuck for over one and half years, it is a path-breaking economic reform. It unifies the country. Recently you met Ms Jayalalithaa after she was sworn in as the Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee has extended her support for GST and Congress allies at the state level are supporting the GST bill. Do you feel optimistic that GST bill will be passed in the next session of the Parliament?First we need to understand, that we look at GST only within the purview of an economic reform because of which the right information doesn't come out. Not having GST straight away means loss for the poor of Uttar Pradesh. Absence of GST straight away means loss for the poor people of Bihar. Not passing the GST would mean loss for the poor people of poor states like Bengal, Orissa and Assam. People who sit in the Rajya Sabha must understand this. GST is beneficial for the poor people of the states represented by them, because those states will economically benefit the most from GST. The money will be used for the welfare of the poor people of those states. This is why be it Mamata Banerjee, be it Nitish Kumar, be it Akhilesh Yadav or Naveen Patnaik, all these states want the GST bill to be passed at the earliest. There is just one group which has made it the issue of prestige. Now the kind of arithmetic which is working out, I hope that this decision is passed in favour of the poor. You will be surprised to what extent has the opposition reached to the level of distortion. In the previous session we introduced an act. Indian government has Rs 40,000 crore rupees from the CAMPA Fund. Rs 40,000 crore. we wanted to give that money to the states. States have to use that money for forestry, for greenery, for planting trees and plants. The bill is meant for that. Had this Rs 40,000 crore reached the states before the monsoons, it would have been used for the forests. A lot of people would have got employment, people who plant trees would have been employed. There would be plantation and due to the rains the plants would start growing within a year. But just because of obstructionism, states have been deprived of the benefit of Rs 40,000 crore. The money was meant for the forests and for the tribals. They blocked it. There was no argument on itThe reason...you had triedMade all efforts.You had invited former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi here at the Race Course RoadWe held talks at every levelStill? The word you used 'ego issue', why has it become an ego issue? And people would want to know why is the Prime Minister unable to end this?The Prime Minister cannot answer this question. Those creating obstructions can only answer this question. But despite this, I will keep trying. I am ready to convince them in which ever way possible. If I have to convoke someone over a cup of tea at their house, I am even ready for that. I have no problem. My only aim is the welfare of the poor of my country and the poor of states like Uttar Pradesh.You spoke of Uttar Pradesh. Mr Prime Minister, elections will be held in Uttar Pradesh in 6,7,8 months. The focus of entire nation will be on it. You are the MP from Varanasi. But some comments are made by BJP, some say Sangh Parivar, some independent groups, communal colour is added to it and not just from one party but from other parties as well. Mr Prime Minister are you going to be able to keep development as the sole agenda? The main issue in the Uttar Pradesh polls should be that of development, it shouldn't get capsized, the focus shouldn't be elsewhere. Are you confident that communal agenda will not overpower development?It's my conviction, it's my commitment. You must have seen during the 2014 elections that I fought elections on the issue of development. The new generation of the country only believes in development. I believe that solution to all problems is in development. Development is also the solution to the tension that people talk about. If we provide employment to people, if we ensure there's food on their plates, if we provide them with facilities and give them education, all the tension will end. And this is why, all those who want good for the nation, I request them to compete towards development and for development. This atmosphere should be created in the country and I think such an environment is being created nowadays.So the hot heads who make extreme comments, is there a necessity to control them? So that there is no politics in the name of religionFirstly, I am of the firm belief that the nation should progress on the issue of development. And it is necessary that the country moves forward on the issue of development. I would like to tell the media not to make heroes out of those people who make such comments.But they keep making such commentsDon't make them heroes, they will stopWe don't make them heroes, we make them villains.But why do you make them so big? I see such statements by people on TV, whose faces I haven't even seen and they end up becoming spokesmen on TVSelf styled spokesmenI don't know why such people are encouragedMr Prime Minister, let's talk in 2016 of the 2017 elections. After Delhi, then Bihar, then Assam, West Bengal. After that we will talk about Punjab. Before we finish talking about Punjab, we will talk about Uttar Pradesh. Then there is the Gujarat state election. Don't you think that this country is permanently stuck in an electoral cycle? The focus constantly and I want you to reflect on this issue, the focus is on party politics, polarising issues, not on governance. We are a country, if we say, we are constantly in a political campaign mode. Is this a good thing? Should we break away from it? And what is your view on it?See this is not an issue about Narendra Modi or the Prime Minister. And also it is not an issue about a particular party or a particular Government.But before the last Parliament session, the Speaker had called all the parties for a meal. After the agenda meeting everyone was sitting to eat. I had also reached at the same time. While talking casually over food, almost people from all parties said that the central and state elections must be held together. Everyone said it. After that during the farewell function of the Rajya Sabha MPs, people from different parties were talking with each other. One of the leaders said, Modiji do anything but get us out of this cycle of electionsWas that leader from your party?No, he was not from my party. So I said that discussion should happen. What is wrong in that? Then one day I said that this was being talked about. This issue has also been discussed in a Parliamentary committee. This work has also been started by the Election Commission and I think they have also writen a letter on it. Like in the fight against black money, this issue of elections also gets connected to black money. Electoral reforms are necessary if the country has to be rid of black money. It is one of the areas for electoral reforms. I believe that the Prime Minister cannot take a decision on this and nor should he do that. Neither the government can do this. There should be a broad discussion on this and we should not run away from the debate on this continious cycle of elections. The Indian voter today is very mature. He votes in one fashion in the Lok Sabha elections, he votes in a different manner in the State Assembly elections. We have seen this. In 2014, the General Elections conincided with the Odisha Assembly elections. The same electorate gave one judgement for Odisha and another judgement for Delhi. So this country's voter is very mature and we should trust his maturity. There should be a debate on how costs can be reduced by holding simultaneous elections, how the influence of black money can be curbed, how the five years can be spent in taking the country forward. Today due to the model code of conduct, there is a loss even in those areas where the code is not applicable. When I was in Gujarat, I found that at least 80 to 90 officers were spending two to three months on election duties in other states. This could be happening in every state. So this is an area of concern and some time or the other this question will have to be thought of. I would want the Election Commission to take this debate forward. They should invite all political parties and hold discussions with everybody and whatever comes out of itCan there be a timebound resolution in this?The Election Commission will have to invite all political parties to discuss this. The process will get derailed if one party were to initiate thisAre you willing to take the lead in building that consensus?Despite being the Prime Minister, I still belong to a political party. The better thing would be for the Election Commission to initiate this. Today the Election Commission is a very prestigious institution in our country. Every political party believes in the Election Commission and it will further empower this institution and that will be betterI think it is an interesting idea of simultaneous elections. Though state parties, regional parties may feel that it will effect them badly. That the national parties like the BJP will gainOdisha is the best example. Odisha is the best example. In 2014, the BJP had no advantage in the state but the BJP won on the Lok Sabha seats. This shows the differenceMr Prime Minister how are you keeping your schedule nowadays? I mean you keep a terrifying pace. The number of meetings you hold, people say your officers find it hard to keep upIt is not so, it has been 2 years now and everyone is used to the work. I believe that it is such a big country that one must do as much work as possible. So I keep doing thatBefore I come to my last question Mr Prime Minister, one issue that I want to come to is the farmers' crisis. As you are well aware, there has been a crisis in this country, you referred to it. In that speech to your MPs, about which I asked you earlier as well, on 20th May in the Central Hall of Parliament you said that 'this government is not for myself, this government is for the poor, we must do something for them.' The farmers' crisis Mr Prime Minster is a reality. I am glad that in this interview you have not avoided the reality, you've faced it, you've talked about it. We have linked our entire future to the monsoons. How do we overcome this from becoming an annual crisis in this country?We will have to put stress on water management here. You must have seen that under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayi Yojana, we have put stress on water issues. During these drought days, I met leaders from 11 states separately and sat with them for about 2-3 hours each. The country would have believed that their Prime Minister is working even if I had held a meeting with 11 of them together for around 10 minutes. But I didn't do that. I sat with leaders from different states separately to understand specific problems and what we could do for water in those states. I am happy, whichever party the state government affiliated to, all the governments focused a lot on water issues this summer. We will reap its benefits this monsoon. Using scientific methods for water accumulation and irrigation, collecting water and directing them towards the fields, everyone did that. Micro irrigation is stressed upon. Even for sugarcane farming, farmers are slowly moving towards micro irrigation which earlier happened through flood irrigation. Paddy crops for which large amount of water is used. Today, farmers have started using drip irrigation for it. If we do well in water facilities, then one of the problems is solved. After independence, for the first time, we have brought in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana which can cover maximum number of farmers. The farmer will have to pay only 2%, only 2%, the government will take care of the rest. The farmers will get an assurance. For instance, in Maharashtra, the monsoons are expected in the month of June, the farmers have prepared for everything but haven't started with the sowing process. Now if there are no rains till August, so practically his crops have not been damaged, because he did not sow the seeds. But the Pradhan Mantri fasal Beema Yojana even takes this into consideration and benefits the farmer. Another important aspect, once the crops are harvested, they're cut and kept in the field, assuming it has been a good year for crop growth, with 100% crop production, but it hasn't been loaded on trucks and sent to the market yet. And if it rains, even after 15 days of harvesting, if there is loss, it is covered under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana. Second layer of protection, minimum premium with maximum cover. After independence, for the first time, we have brought in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana. Thirdly, first time we have brought in E-Mandi concept. Farmer in the village, can sell the crops to the best markets in the country through his mobile phone. Farmer would set the price at which the crop would be sold. Earlier, farmers used to take the produce on carts or tractors, used to go to a mandi 20-25kms away, then due to storage issues, even if they had to sell for Rs 10 less than the price, they used to sell it. Now, sitting at home the farmer would know what price to sell the crops at. Next point is about, food processing, value addition. We opened up 100% foreign direct investment in food processing. For example, if a farmer is selling tomatoes and if a company is processing tomato ketchup then my farmers would benefit from it. The companies that make aerated drinks, Coca-Cola, Pepsi etc, I requested them to add 5% natural fruit juice. In regions near Nagpur and Vidarbha where oranges are cultivated, Coca-Cola is going to add 5% of orange juice. If we add 5% natural juice to aerated water, farmers would get their market and their fruits wouldn't go waste. We should have a comprehensive all-out scheme. So much of our land has been damaged. We have brought in Soil Health Card. We have a Soil Health Abhiyan. The farmer will know the feritility of the land through it. Whether a fertilizer needs to be used or not, the farmer will understand. On an average, a farmer with 1 hectare of land will be able to save Rs 15000-20000. So we have brought in scientific methods. You would know that in our country, farmers used to be lathicharged when they would go to buy urea and they had to buy it in black. We got urea 100% neem coated. Earlier, urea used to go to chemical factories, and the government subsidies were stolen in the name of farmers. After neem coating, urea cannot be used for any other purpose except farming. Because of neem coating, there is a qualitative change which helps in healing the damaged land. Due to neem coating a piece of land that used 10 kgs of urea can now manage with 7 kgs of urea. All these initiatives are in the direction of agriculture and the results will be seen soon.Do you think that the farmers' crisis will be resolved, the question I asked, that it won't be an annual affair, the dependence on monsoons will go down?See agriculture is a state subject. The Indian government has taken initiatives, if the state government are enthusiastic to implement this, which I think they will be. As I told you I met leaders from different states and they worked a lot for water issues. If this works, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana has direct involvement of the central government, it will have great benefits.Mr Prime Minister now I have two questions for you.This has become too long.I'll club these two (questions) together. You're also enjoying it and I am glad you're speaking Mr Prime Minister because there is so much ground to cover and I think viewers would like to hear your view, sir. Actually there are three, if you allow me. They're short questions. First is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, how much is politics playing on your mind? In the sense that every Prime Minister, especially someone who is as forthright as you, looks at the next big challenge. Is 2019 anywhere in your mind?Those who have seen me in Gujarat, and those who have seen me in the last two years, those who see me without any bias, they will know that I am an apolitical Prime Minister. Apart from elections, I don't get involved into politics ever. You can call elections a necessity, a restraint or a responsibility, we have to do it. I attend many functions, go to different areas, you wouldn't have heard any political comment from me. If I go to a government function, I talk about government related topics. If I attend a Railways function I talk about railways, if water then water, if water bodies, then water bodies. My focus is on governance. Country has been at greatest loss because governments were run only for elections. Governments must not run only for elections. The government should be a bona fide attempt of meeting the demands and expectations of the common people. Elections should just be a bi-product. It is a democracy. Winning and losing is a part of it. It shouldn't be hyped. You would have seen recently I urged everyone to pay taxes before 30th September. I even said it on Mann Ki Baat yesterday. Will a person, who is only concerned with winning elections, say that post 30th September you'd face problems?This was also a warning in a way.It is a warning. It is definitely a warning. It is a warning. My first warning is to my government officers to not presume citizens as thieves. I have already given this warning. I have handled my officers first. It took me quite some time. You will be shocked to hear that I have given an early retirement to more than 30 people from Income Tax Department on integrity issues. This isn't a small issue. People who weren't transferred since 20 years, I got them transferred. So, one, my focus is on my system. Second, I also tell the country, that for the poor of the nation we would have to give out something for the poor in our country. It is my responsibility to give the people an account of every rupee. I will use it at right places. I won't let it get stolen. But if I need to give houses to the poor, we would need revenue. I don't want to increase taxes, I just want taxes to be paid honestly. There is no need to increase the taxes. The country can run without troubling the citizens. I am working towards it. That is why I have given the citizens a chance to pay the taxes till 30th September, whatever it is Rs 10,000 or Rs. 50,000. If they think they want to come into mainstream, they must and shouldn't be worried. After 30th September, the government will have to take steps. I will not worry about the polls. I will take the necessary steps. I want to work for the poor in my country.Mister Prime Minister, do some crystal ball gazing for the next three years. For the next three years, to use the cricketing analogy, how do you find your run rate so far and will you have to score at a higher run rate in the next three years to achieve your targets?See, no matte at what speed I move forward, I am never satisfied. If today I run at a speed of 100, I keep an aim of running at 200. I think that the world that was behind us, has gone ahead. We need to run a lot to match that level. So we do not need to calculate. We just need to give it all in. And I have given myself in completely. I've been successful is pulling my entire government in. I believe that the country is also committed to move forwardFinal question to you Mr Prime Minister, what motivates you the most? First of all as I said, will you be able to keep this pace? What motivates you the most and also if you can share with our viewers honestly what is your one greatest source of worry?Firstly, I don't live under the burden of worries. Problems and challenges are there, you can't deny that. But you must challenge the challenges and not let the challenges turn into worries. This is my principle. I challenge the challenges. I like to face the problems. I don't run away from them. Whatever loss I have to face for it, I face it. But I can't leave the country helpless. This responsibility must be taken and I will continue to do so. For all good and bad things, it is my responsibility. I do not regret anything. I believe, people of the country have given me the responsibility and I must fulfill it. Thirdly, when I see the poor in our country, it reminds me of the work that I have to do for them. Day before yesterday, I was in Pune, and met a Shrimaan Chandrakant ji. A retired teacher with a pension of Rs 16000, donates Rs 5000 every month for Swachh Abhiyaan. If a 70 year old retired teacher with children and family at home, without worrying about them, worries about the country, then being the Prime Minister, I should work a thousand times more than Chandrakant ji. This is my inspiration. People of this country who work day and night, they are my inspiration. I look at them and I work even harder.Prime Minister Narendra Modi it has been a privilege. I am grateful for this interview.Thank youAnd thank you on behalf of all our viewers that you spoke frankly. The program is Frankly Speaking and I am thankful to you that you were so frank.I just request you to not create controversies out of this but instead use it for the benefit of the country.Please do not think like that. Thank you very muchThanks a lot. Thank you very much.","prime minister's interviewprism of pakistanprime minister narendra modi in an interview with times now has shared his views on a range of issues. here is the complete transcript of thewith arnab goswami.prime minister modi thank you very much for this interview. thank you very muchmy greetings to all the peoplethis is your first one to one interview to a private news channel since you became prime minister. and if i am not mistaken, this is the first ever interview by a sitting prime minister of india to a private television news channel in the country. so i would first like to thank you and am very grateful for the opportunity.the world of the media has grown so big that everybody has to attach themselves with it.i am very grateful and our viewers will be very grateful also mr modi because they want to hear your views on a range of subjects. mr prime minister i would like to start by taking you back to 20th may 2014. the results came on may 16th. four days later, you gave a historic speech in the central hall of parliament and you were speaking to the members of parliament. you had said four days after the results that an era of responsibility has begun. and that you said that in 2019 before the elections, i will come back to this parliament, i will come back to the mps and i will give my report card. forty percent into your tenure, how much have you achieved of your own targets?when i went for the first time as an mp to the central hall, and it was the first time i was seeing the central hall. i had not been there before. so i had then said that becoming the prime minister was not about the designation of the office but it was about the responsibilities and work of being a pm. i had also said that my government would be committed to the poor. i was completely new in the job. delhi was new for me. the delhi environment was new to me. the work of the government of india was also new for me. but despite that, in such a short time, the pace at which the country has moved forward, and it's not on one subject. you can pick up any aspect of the government's functioning, and if you make a comparison with the past governments, then you will realize that no issue has been ignored. there has been an effort to bring in something new in every area. there is an effort to bring in change in every area. one big challenge was that i was not experienced about this place, i had not even been an mp. the office was new, the questions were also new. but when i look at the second biggest challenge, we should remember those days when the country was engulfed in disappointment. the everyday news was about whether there would be any electricity production after seven days, whether coal would be supplied or not. this was the situation then. the entire system was engulfed in disappointment. the big challenge was to inject new trust into the system and create confidence among the citizens. it is very difficult to evaluate this from the outside but i have gone through it. but today i can say with a lot of satisfaction that now there is no trace of any disappointment. the intention to do something is visible. and it's not in words but in actual achievement. i had said that within a given timeframe, we will open bank accounts for the poor. for something that had not been done for 60 years, setting a timeframe for it was in itself a risk. but because of that a trust was created in the system that it was something doable. so that's the process i started for awakening the confidence. and today you can see that in every sector, the changed circumstances can be seen. while evaluating the performance of this government, never forget that you will have to make that evaluation in comparison with the 10 years of the previous government. only then will you know where we were and where we are now. we should not be talking about what we are aiming for. for now you will have to assess the present in comparison with the immediate past and in that you will find a bright futuremr. modi, i want to start now on the issue of foreign policy. in the area of foreign policy, you have taken great personal interest. the amount of personal interest you have shown in foreign policy, probably none of the previous prime ministers showed the same kind of interest. your approach is pro active. what i find interesting about your foreign policy is that you have balanced different powers and different interests. on the one side, your relationship with us, you made sure that india enters the missile control technology regime with them. a week before that you also signed the historic chabahar port agreement with iran. so, you have balanced very diverse forces. my question to you over this is that, is it easy to do that as an indian prime minister? secondly, on the issue of the nsg, you staked a lot of personal interest, personal push, you lobbied actively. how close are we to getting the nsg seat?firstly, about foreign policy, you need to know what has strengthened our foreign policy. for 30 years, in our country, the government was unstable. for 30 years, party with a clear mandate wasn't given the opportunity to form the government. the world measures the government of a nation on the basis of its condition in its own country, on how strong their word is in their own country. i am thankful to the people of this country, that after 30 years, they chose a government with absolute majority and this has had an impact on world politics. countries and world leaders have changed their perspective towards india. this is the biggest benefit. secondly, the world didn't know me. the world wants to know who the head of the state is. if someone would want to know modi through the eyes of the media, then he would be disillusioned on which modi is the real modi. if this happens, the country will be at a loss. modi's personality shouldn't be a hindrance for the world to have faith in india. but for that unless i meet all those leaders and engage them them one to one, unless i speak to them frankly, they wouldn't know about india's head of state, so it was very important for me as i am not from a political family. i never had the opportunity to meet the world leaders earlier.you were an unknown entity in foreign policymore than foreign policy it was foreign relations. yes, i was new to it. so for me, being pro active was mandatory. thirdly, we work as a team. foreign ministry, prime minister's officer, commerce ministry, finance ministry, defense minister, everyone works as a team, not as separate pieces. the impact that is now visible, is not just because of modi, it is because of the team. all teams work in a particular direction. that is why the impact is seen, earlier these teams were splintered. we have seen instances where the party would give a statement, the prime minister would say something else, party leaders would say something else. this disunity has had a negative impact. thirdly, we also need to understand that earlier the world was bi polar. foreign policy would be centered around two super powers. india was a little late in realizing that this bi polar situation was for namesake. now the entire world, in changed circumstances, especially in 21st century, it is more interdependent and inter connected, earlier, the foreign policy was possible between governments, but today it is not possible just between governments. government relations are important but increasing people to people contact is equally important. there's been a shift in paradigm. because i do not have any previous baggage, because i've had a clean slate, i write everything from beginning and that has a benefit. today we are building relations with countries across the world. the amount of respect with which i engage saudi arabia, i engage iran with the same amount of respect. the amount of respect with which i speak to america, i speak to russia with the same amount of respect. so we need to understand this. we also need to understand that we shouldn't consider smaller countries insignificant. i abide by this principle. the small countries of the world are as important as the big nations. we had assumed that the relations with smaller nations would develop under the shadow of the bigger nations. i brought about a change in this. you must have seen that i made a forum for the pacific island nations. we have had two meetings. i went there once and they came here once. these are small countries with a population of about 10 lakh or 20 lakh. but these small island nations are most affected by global warming. when india took up the international solar mission and 122 nations joined it, the island nations benefitted the most out of it. they are 50 in number now. a group of 50 nations, feels secured with this vision of india. if we try to understand this change, then we would realize that in the world, a few days back, i was sitting with the officers of our foreign services, so as we got talking, in a very poetic way i told them that there was a time when we used to sit by the sea and count the waves, but the time has now changed, we are done counting waves, now it's time for us to steer ourselves, ride the waves and decide on our direction, destination and speedthat is apparent. you have a very aggressive foreign policy. but my second question was, you put so much effort for nsg membership. my question was, how close are we to nsg membership and were you disappointed that we did not make it at the very end because of china's opposition?look the first thing is that india has been continuously making these efforts, no matter which government was in office. be it the membership of the un security council or the sco membership or mtcr membership or nsg membership. every government has made an effort. it's not that only this government is trying, it's in continuity. but it's during our tenure that we achieved sco membership, we also got the mtcr membership. i have full faith that now we have begun a coordinated effort for the nsg membership too. the process has begun on a positive note. everything has rules and will work accordingly and move forwardis it the problem of mindset with china? there have been 13 engagements at various levels between the narendra modi government and the chinese government. the latest engagement was when you went to tashkent. you spent some time with the chinese president xi jinping. yet it was seen that in the case of masood azhar, china blocked india's un bid to ban him. now they have stalled india's nsg bid. why is china repeatedly blocking us mr prime minister despite your personal proactive measures and your government's outreach?the first thing is that we have an ongoing dialogue with china and it should continue to happen. in foreign policy it's not necessary to have similar views to have a conversation. even when the views are contradictory, talks are the only way forward and problems should be resolved through dialogue. we don't have one problem with china, we have a whole lot of problems pending with china. slowly and steadily, an effort is on to address these issues through talks and make them less cumbersome. i can say that china has been cooperating with india to search for solutions. on some issues, it's a question of principles for them. on some issues, it's a question of principles for us. on some issues they differ with us and there are issues on which we differ with them. there are some basic differences. but the most important thing is that we can speak to china eye-to-eye and put forth india's interests in the most unambiguous manner. we are a government that takes care of india's interests. we don't compromise on this. three days ago i met the chinese president. i told him clearly about india's interests. they are a different country, we are a different countrydo you think you will be able to change their mindset on the issue of nsg membership?see the foreign policy is not about changing mindsets. foreign policy is about finding the common meeting points. where do our interests converge and how much? we have to sit and talk with every country. it's our ongoing effortthis statement that you just made is also apt in the context of america where you gave a speech in the u.s congress. by the way mr prime minister it was a fantastic speechthank youthere was a lot of humour. you were laughing and cracking jokes while you delivered the speech which was very unique. they also appreciated it. was the speech impromptu?i have a humourous side but these days humour can be a risky thingwhy do you say that?in this era of 24/7 news channels, anybody can lift a small word and make a big issue out of it. but i will tell you the truth, the reason for the absence of humour in public life is this fear. i am myself scared . earlier when i used to make speeches, i would make it so humourous but there would never be any issueshave you become more conscious now?i am not conscious. i am in fear, there is no humour left in public life because of this fear. everyone is scared. i am in fear. my speeches used be humourous. i see it in parliament, that humour is finished there too. it is a matter of concern. i will quote one proverb.yes, go ahead.even if you mention a proverb, they will connect it with something else and begin a conversation. the one who is saying the proverb does not know for what he is speaking.but you should not lose your sense of humour mr prime ministerbut it is true that my trip to the united states of america, my speech in their congress and the respect shown towards india created a lot of hype. had it not been hyped so much, there would not have been so much criticism on the nsg issue. government is being criticized not for any mishandling of the nsg issue but because we were so successful over there (in the usa)did china become conscious of your growing friendship with us?i am talking about what's happening herebut when you delivered that speech in context of america, you used a very interesting phrase. you said 'we have to overcome the hesitations of history'. my hindi is not that good. like hesitations of history. but my question to you is mr prime minister, how close can we get to america because many indians believe that america is still supporting pakistan, giving them military assistance. how close can we get? at what point do we stop before we are seen like an american ally? what is your own world view on that?i would especially like to appeal to my country's media that we should stop looking at everything in india from the. india is an independent country. it is a country of 125 crore people. whenever it approaches any country, it will only be concerned about its own interests. it has been our biggest shortcoming and mistake that we have been tagging ourselves with another country and trying to do things. we are an independent country, we have our own policies and future. we have to think about the future of our 125 crore people. there should be no compromise on our interests. we have relations with america in the context of these fundamental pointshow close can we get to them?there has been warmth in our relationship. you must have seen the editorials in american newspapers after my visit to that country. one point mentioned in those editorials was that the success of obama's foreign policy has been the warm relationship with india. this has been saidwhat you are saying modiji is that we can be close to america but we need not be an ally or seen to be an ally?the first thing is that we no longer live in a bipolar world. the world is interconnected and interdependent. you will have to connect with everybody at the same time. even if there are two opposing countries, they will have to be friends. now the times have changedmr modi, on 8th may 2014, i had the opportunity to interview you, the interview took place in ahmedabad, i think one last phase of elections was left. we were discussing the issue of pakistan. you have had an uncompromising approach towards pakistan. two days back, lashkar e toiba killed 8 crpf jawans in an attack. in the 8th may interview, you put forth a very interesting phrase, you said 'can talks be heard amidst the noise of bombs, guns and pistols?' this is how you had phrased it. do you believe we have been too generous towards pakistan? do you believe we have been too generous towards pakistan?there are two things. one - india has always wanted friendly ties with its neighbours, there can be no debate around it. we want to live in harmony and peace. and i have said it repeatedly, that india has to fight poverty, pakistan too has to fight poverty, why don't we come together to fight poverty? i said this before elections and during election campaigns. also i had invited leaders of saarc nations to my swearing in ceremony and they had attended it as well. so there has been no change in our intent, our thoughts and our current behaviour. number two - those who have to work from the table, will work from the table and those who have to work at the border, will work at border with full strength. each one will fulfill the responsibility entrusted to them. and our jawans are fulfilling their responsibilities. it's true that pressure on terrorists has increased, their schemes are proving unsuccessful. the intent with which they move forward are foiled and they have to face major challenges. it is because of this disappointment that such incidents are taking place and our jawans are risking their lives and protecting the country. we are very proud of our jawanswhen your foreign policy is studied, observers analyze what's happening and what's not happening. if you give me the opportunity, i want to do a bit of analyses. there was a terrific pace of engagement with pakistan between october, november and december. on 30th november, you met nawaz sharif on the sidelines (of un climate summit in paris). both of you were seated on a sofa, talking to each other. a lot of people were speculating the contents of your conversation. this was on the sidelines of climate summit. after that, all of a sudden within seven days there were nsa level talks and ajit doval spoke to nasir janjua in bangkok. and again after that you went to russia via afghanistan, you made an unexpected visit to nawaz sharif in lahore. it was a personal trip but it still had some level of importance. eight days later, pakistani terrorists attacked pathankot. can you tell our viewers whether pakistan was proactively responding in the months of october, november and december? did the pathankot terror attack change the situation? is it true that pakistan was making a lot of movement in those three months?look there are different types of forces operating in pakistan. but the government only engages with a democratically elected system. our effort for that engagement is continuing. but our supreme objective is peace. our supreme objective is to protect india's interests. we keep making effort toward that objective and sometimes our efforts are successful. as far as meetings and talks are concerned, we signalled right from the day i took oath and sent invitations for the oath taking ceremony, that we seek friendly relations but without compromising on our interests. and that is why i have said that my country's soldiers have full freedom to answer back in whatever manner they have to and they will keep doing thatmr prime minister what is the 'lakshman rekha' that you would draw when it comes to pakistan. there is some confusion surrounding this subject. i would like you to give an elaborate reply. in 2014, it was believed that if talks are being held, then they should be held between two countries and not with hurriyat. it should be between the government of india and the government of pakistan. the other 'lakshman rekha' is that you must act on 26/11. there's been no forward movement so far. the third thing is about forward movement on the pathankot attack case. so what is the 'lakshman rekha' now and if pakistan remains within those bounds, so talks can happen at the political level or at any other level?the first thing is that with pakistan, to whom do we talk to decide about the 'lakshman rekha'. will it be with the elected government or with other actors? that is why india will have to be on alert all the time. india will have to be alert every moment. there can never be any laxity in this. but there is an outcome due to my continuous efforts like my visit to lahore and my invitation to the pakistani prime minister to come to india. now i don't have to explain to the world about india's position. the world is unanimously appreciating india's position. and the world is seeing that pakistan is finding it difficult to respond. if we had become an obstacle, then we would have had to explain to the world that we are not that obstacle. now we don't have to explain to the world. the world knows our intentions. like on the issue of terrorism, the world never bought india's theory on terrorism. they would sometime dismiss it by saying that it's your law and order problem. today the world has to accept what india has been saying about terrorism. india's dialogue on terrorism, the losses india has suffered due to terrorism, the losses suffered by humanity, the world is now acknowledging that. so i believe we have to take this process forwardmr prime minister i now want to move to questions on the economy. in the past two years you have started many schemes. if we look at the theme of jan dhan yojna for financial inclusion, pradhan mantri fasal bima yojna for crop insurance, swach bharat, skill india, make in india. if we see the theme running through these schemes, is your social agenda at the core of your personal economic philosophy, social transformation? is the social agenda at the core of your economic philosophy as the prime minister?the first point is our philosophy is to reach the last man in the line. pandit deendayal upadhyay's philosophy forms the core of our political, economic and social ideology. and even mahatma gandhi used to say that what is there for the last man? so my development parameter is very simple. it is about how the poorest of the poor can benefit from development. the poor is the central focus of my economic agenda. the poor should be strengthened in such a way that they get the willingness to defeat poverty. by helping the poor make ends meet while they remain in poverty is also one of the ways. i am not saying right or wrong but it's one of the ways. but today the country's situation is such that we should make the poor strong so that they become partners in defeating poverty. all these schemes are meant to empower the poor and change the quality of life. the pradhan mantri jan dhan yojna is not only about opening bank accounts for the poor. because of this the poor are feeling that they are becoming a part of the country's economic system. the bank that he was seeing from afar, now he is able to enter that bank. this brings about a psychological transformation. looked at in another way, did you ever imagine that 40 thousand crores could be injected into the banking system by contributions from the poor. the poor who never had bank accounts, have deposited 100 rupees, 50 rupees or 200 rupees. it means that poor man saved 100 rupees and the change began in his life. we have taken up construction of toilets. i had gone to chhattisgarh and had the opportunity to get the blessings of one mother. an adivasi mother heard about the scheme for building toilets. she sold her four goats and built a toilet. that 90 old mother uses a walking stick and goes around the cluster of 30 or 40 houses in the tribal village and has been spreading the message to build toilets. this change is becoming the reason for the change in the quality of life. i have begun the cleanliness campaign. it's estimated an individual spends an average of 7000 rupees for treatment of a disease. the main reason for disease is filth. the poor suffer the most from the filth. if a poor man falls sick, he cannot drive his rickshaw for two days and his children go hungry. so how can we help the poor bring about change in their lives? now there is a neo-middle class and a middle class in the country. the young have their aspirations. so another aspect of my policies you must have seen are the start up india, stand up india, seaport activity, port activity, railways expansion, railway station upgradation. these changes directly appeal to the middle class. the middle class has its aspirations. we have to create jobs? how will job creation happen? till i invest in the development of infrastructure, there be no job creation. you must have seen that the maximum electricity generation since independence has occurred this year. the maximum amount of coal mined has been in this year. the maximum length of roads being constructed daily is happening in this year. the fastest loading and unloading of steamers at sea ports is happening now. all these changes are creating opportunities for employment like in start up india, stand up india. for instance in stand up india, i have said that every bank should give an economic opportunity to one woman, one dalit or one tribal person to become entrepreneurs. this will create many job opportunities. so this is the basis of my economic philosophy.mr prime minister if i could interrupt you on this. on the one hand is the people's expectations and on the other is your vision. many programs that you have mentioned, you can't put a calendar date to it but they don't have an immediate impact. they maybe able to show results in 3, 4, 5 maybe beyond 5 years. now there are challenges in that. mr prime minister, you are aware more than anyone else that people want immediate results. now you spoke of job creation. the first thing, as an achievement you have managed to grow the economy at 7.5 per cent when the global economic climate is very bleak. you have spoken about it as well. you have met fiscal deficit targets, fdi inflows have increased but people are saying that job opportunities are not increasing. you have spoken about infrastructure but the current rate of unemployment. mr prime minister, the latest labour bureau figures, is it a source of concern for you as the prime minister?the first thing is that are 800 million people below the age of 35 in our country. we have to accept that the demand for jobs is very high. but where will they get employment? investment will come in. it will be used in the infrastructure sector, manufacturing and services sector. now like the initiative we have taken, we have started the mudra yojna. more than three crore people in the country comprise washermen, barbers, milkman, newspaper vendors, cart vendors. we have given them nearly 1.25 lakh crore rupees without any guarantee. now why have these people taken the money? to expand their work. when he expands his work, if he is currently employing one person, now he has to employ two people. if there were two employed earlier, now there are three. now just think, when 3 crore of these small businesses have got access to finance, they must have expanded their work. now all this is not in the labour department's registration. three crore people have expanded their work. we took another small decision. the big malls in the country run 365 days a year but the smaller shops have to close on holidays. we announced in the budget that even a small shopkeeper can operate his shop till late night and that too on all the seven days of the week. if the malls don't have restrictions then why should the small shopkeepers have restrictions. so now if a shopkeeper operates his shop till late and on all seven days, if he earlier employed one person, now he will have to employ two people. so won't the employment increase?so is your focus on entrepreneurship?our focus is on all aspects. now we are saying that by 2022 we want to ensure that everyone has a house. housing sector has the maximum potential for creating employment. houses will be built in such huge numbers, how many people will get employment? you must have seen that last year we brought in a textile policy. under this textile policy, there will be income tax benefits for those who create employment. the more employment one creates, the more tax benefits they will get. for the first time, employment generation and tax has been linked. these are the things that boost employment and our central focus is creating employment for the ordinary citizenmr prime minister, questions are also being raised on food inflation which has still not decreased. the expectation was that the food inflation would decline. the people had put their hopes on the prime minister that you will bring down prices. this not only has a political impact but also has a social impact. over the past two weeks, there were reports that in some places the price of arhar dal had touched 150 rupees and 200 rupees for other pulses. the price of tomatoes was also rising. is this only seasonal because the food inflation is increasing at 7.5 per cent year on year. global oil prices have fallen. do you think this creates perception issues for your government?you can't view inflation as a perception issue. price rise should be seen as a reality. what is available for a consumer should be seen for what it is. there should never be an attempt to view price rise as a perception issue as a means of escaping the reality of price rise. we will have to accept reality. you see the fast pace at which prices were rising under the previous government, today that speed has decelerated a lot. you can see the statistics, you will find it there. second, the country has gone through two consecutive years of severe drought. drought has a direct impact on the price of vegetables, food and pulses because all these things are produced from the soil. now when there is such a big drought, it's not in anybody's hands. the second option in such a situation is imports. the indian government has imported pulses in huge quantities. third, it is the joint responsibility of the state and central governments. it is not exclusively the state's responsibility. it is not exclusively the centre's responsibility. it is the joint responsibility of both the state and central governments. this should not be an issue of blame game that the state government did not do certain things and that the centre did not do certain things. but it will have to be agreed that it is the joint responsibility of both. that is why the centre has given rights to the states to make stringent laws. how much stocks to keep or not to keep are decisions which the states can take. all these rights have been given to the states. some states have performed well, some states are trying. but the centre and state governments are trying to work together on this. i believe that we have been successful to the extent that the speed with which prices were rising (under upa), what would have happened if the prices were to rise at that speed. we have been successful in stopping that speedy rise of prices. but as far as pulses are concerned, production in india has been very low. many farmers who were earlier sowing pulses have started cultivating sugar. that is also an area of concern. we gave special incentives for pulses. we have tried to set up a different msp for pulses. we have taken steps to procure pulses from farmers with bonus. our focus is on increasing the production of pulses. we are also focusing on building stocks of pulses by importing from abroad. an all out effort is being made and i believe that nobody doubts the sincerity of this governmentmr prime minister what is your view about the controversy around the exit of raghuram rajan as the rbi governor? a lot has been spoken about this. there was commentary that it may effect india's image, perception as a global economy. what's your own view of the controversy around the exit of raghuram rajan?when my government was formed in may 2014, you take newspapers from may, june, july 2014 and check television debates during that period. the topic of the television debates would be - will the new govt let raghuram rajan continue? or will the new government oust raghuram rajan? and there was more or less consensus that he was appointed by the previous govt and so modi won't let him complete his tenure and will remove him. you have seen, that he worked his entire tenure. for the time he was appointed by the previous government, he completing his entire term. so all the misconceptions have been dispelled. secondly, according to my 2 year experience in govt, those who are creating controversies, are being unjust to raghuram rajanwhy so?i will tell you. those who say...i believe raghuram rajan's patriotism is no less than any of ours. it will be doing injustice to him if one says that he will serve the country only if he is at a particular post. as much as i know raghuram rajan, whatever post he holds, wherever he is, he is someone who will continue to serve the country. he is someone who loves his country. therefore, it's not like the nation won't get raghuram rajan's services, raghuram rajan is not that kind of a person. he is a person who loves the country. those who speak such language are doing great injustice to him. my experience with him has been good.i appreciate the work he has done. and my good wishes will always be with himprime minister modi, there's a question related to this. during your speech at the executive you used seven words begining with letter 's'-- 'sevabhaav' (service), 'santulan' (balance), 'sanyam' (restraint), 'samvaad' (dialogue), 'samanvay' (coordination), 'sakaratmak' (positivity) and 'samvedna' (sensitivity). i will ask the question in context with raghuram rajan because you used these words in the speech at national executive meet speech on june 14 in allahabad. you said, 'our party leaders and party workers should use these qualities in their daily dealings and behaviour.' prime minister, in raghuram rajan's context, your rajya sabha mp has made many comments. later he made critical remarks against senior bureaucrats. my question is, do you think it is right? when we talk about 'sanyam' (restraint) and 'santulan' (balance), is it correct?whether it is someone from my party or not, i believe that such things are inappropriate. the nation won't benefit from such publicity stunts. one should be more responsible while conducting themselves. anyone who believes he is bigger than the system is wrong.that's a very clear message.i have a very clear message. i have no two minds about it.and mr prime minister, if i may say so, between may 8 and now, you are speaking as straight as you did before you took over as prime minister. i think that answer takes me to the next subject. mr prime minister, the issue is that of black money. in a very interersting way you said, prices should not be looked at from the point of percepetion, equally, mr prime minister it can be said said that an issue like black money should not be looked at in terms of perception, but it is perception forming. there are political debates on this. experts say that the black money economy has shrunk, 10-15% economy has shrunk through land dealings and other things. you have passed the black money bill, you have made taxation more transparent, you have started information sharing with other countries, you have taken steps, but prime minister modi, people still expect that a rs 25 lakh crores will be brought back and put into their bank accounts. how will you address that expectation? the hope that people have taking black money, how will you address it?how did the black money issue arise and how did it become such a serious issue? we have to look at the background. it is an established fact in the minds of the common man those who steal money park their money overseas. it's a common perception. even if i look at it from the common man's perspective, i also wonder where does this money go? this issue was always stalled in the parliament. when the matter reached the supreme court, the supreme court ordered special investigation team to look into it, even then the previous government stalled it for three years, from 2011-2014. it's after this that political parties, the media and the common man started believing that there's something wrong. then the issue of black money became an agenda. even today i can say...that yes, when there is money stashed in foreign accounts, there are some norms of engagement with foreign countries on the issue. but between 2011-2014, these people were given the opportunity to launder money here and thereand you also said on 17 february 2015 on this issue, that the then law minister is only offering lip servicethe result was that people got several chances to launder money. secondly, after our government was formed, the first decision taken by our cabinet was to form a special investigation team to bring back black money which was pending despite supreme court's 2011 order. this shows our sincerity. from then on, you can't imagine how stringent the laws have been made to bring back black money and whoever comes in its fold will know how strict the law is. thirdly, i attended the g20 summit. never was black money issue discussed in the g20 forum. it was my first g20 summit, for the first time i met the world leaders. and for the first time in the g20 summit, one paragraph was on unaccounted money, on black money and 20 countries said that the world should cooperateblack. the dirty money, black money was also linked to terrorism, an environment of global census was created. we have been signing agreements one after the other with different countries that there will be real time, automatic exchange of information with india. i recently visited switzerland and there was minimal discussion on the issue. but after i returned, a big delegation from switzerland visited india, and they held meeting with the indian government and we discussed...for several years, we believed that switzerland is the place where black money is stashed, that country is holding discussions to come to a consensus on automatic information exchange and if we reach consensus it will be a great achievement. thirdly you must've seen that mauritius route came up in almost everything. it was said that money goes out of india and returns through the mauritius route. this was discussed. everyone thought that nothing can be done about the mauritius route.but our government held a dialogue with the mauritius government, made changes to the old treaty. and we successfully made a new treaty to block the money which comes through the mauritius route and very soon it will be phased out and completed. all these decisions are taken to fight the black money menace. this is not a one sided fight. secondly, the govt is working in a direction to make sure that black money isn't generated in india and black money doesn't go out of india, you can see the results of all this.when the opposition raises the rs 15 lakh issue.that is something the opposition raises during elections. let them have some issue to talk aboutmr prime minister, there has been no major financial corruption or scam in your tenure in the last two years. perception is again, what people say is because you keep a very tight control on the reins of government but the question is there are people, who are wilful defaulters, the economic offenders who take a lot of money from the country or commit economic offences in the country, go overseas and use rules and use lawyers, and they don't come back to india. and people are asking now, is the narendra modi govt determined to take these cases of wilful defaulters and economic offenders to their logical conclusion.firstly, this question is not in the minds of people. the people of india have confidence that if there's someone who can do this, it is narendra modi and he will do it. citizens of the country have full faith.does it worry you, that people have misued the law?i take this as an opportunity and i will show them what the law is.mr. modi, there have been several corruption cases about the previous government, which have now come out. there is agustawestland, many defense scams and defense transactions are now being analyzed seriously. the cases which were quoted in the cag reports but were ignored are now coming in the forefront. this question is important because this isn't just about financial corruption but these questions have direct implications on the national security of the country. do you think, when they say that this is a political witch hunt by narendra modi sarkar, do you think all of these cases would have been possible without political patronage?there are many things which are not visible. one can't imagine the difficulty i am experiencing in taking out things from dirt. one who is working there knows the amount of dirt that exists and how certain things have been caught in a web. there are certain powers behind it. the case about agusta helicopters. i can't deny it and i believe that we have the right to doubt that people behind this are very experienced. they have perfectly practiced the art of doing wrong deeds. they are very experienced and knowledgeable. and one can also smell the fact that such a thing wouldn't have been done without a shield. now, agencies are probing. let's see how far the probe goes. but the investigation shouldn't go ahead while people are being targeted, neither does my government target anyone. the sin has been committed, but how much is done, how was it done, who did it, probe agencies will find out in a professional way. whatever comes out, will be put outprime minister, talking about your speech in the us congress, and the humour that you displayed. i felt some of it was impromptu. but the americans were able to relate to what you said, i don't remember the exact words, you said, i am informed that the working of the us congress is harmonious. and then there was a pause and people were laughing. then you said, 'i am told' - you emphasized and said 'i am told that you are well known for your bipartisanship.' then the applause was more. and then you said, 'you are not alone. time and again i have witnessed a similar spirit in the indian parliament.' you spoke about a serious topic in a interesting manner. you referred to the upper house. there was a lot of response on that too. your humour was really appreciated and i think it was a wonderful moment when you were speaking. but, mr. prime minister, when you look back at the parliament, this question comes to many people's minds, has prime minister narendra modi being held back from achieving his own objectives because of the non-stop parliamentary logjam. how much has this affected his moving towards his own targets? if you critically analyze this situation, do you feel your government could have been more consultative or do you feel the blame is entirely with the opposition?i look at it differently. i believe there have been a lot of problems. whether the fault is ours or their's, i 'll leave it to the people. people will decide. but because of discussions in parliament - we may not come to a decision, the decision could be opposing our view, nothing wrong in that. but at least there should be a discussion. the sad part is, if somebody is running away from debate or don't let discussions happen, then it is a cause of worry in a democracy. whether the government's work is accomplished or not, i don't see it as a cause of worry. if not today, it will happen tomorrow. there are certain things which will happen at an administrative level. the big thing is, parliament is for discussion. parliament is to show dissent. parliament is to give an argument for one's opposition, to present an argument when they support.to uphold this basic spirit of parliament, is the responsibility of every person who values democracy. it is the responsibility of those present in the parliament and those outside. it is the responsibility of those in power and those not in power. this is a matter of spirit and it should be followed. as far as the government is concerned, on every issue and at every forum, we have tried to hold discussions. i myself have met the opposition leaders and spoken to them. key members of the government are also in touch. and you must have seen that many issues have been resolved. in the last session, we have passed 12 bills in rajya sabha, we passed 10 bills in the lok sabha. so the pace has picked up. when people say 'opposition', it is unfair to the opposition. there are some parties in the parliament which are not with the bjp or nda, but are with the government on key decisions. so, to defame the opposition by saying that all opposition parties are against us -- when some people do this, it is wrong. there is one party which has problems. and the whole world knows that party. secondly, to say that 'when you were is opposition, you did it this way' there is a difference between every opposition party. 'we have run the government for 60 years and now we are in the opposition, so we know the nitty-gritties of the government, we know the responsibilities. we can't behave in the way, a new opposition party behaves.' a party which hasn't been in power or hasn't seen anything, could behave in this way. for example, we are in power now, and consider in 2040 we become the opposition party. so, in 2040 we can't have the same conduct as the one we had in 2009 or 2010.congress is a very experienced and old partythat's why i say that, those who have been in power for so many years, shouldn't be doing this. if there is a new party in the opposition, they have a small demand for their state or if an mp has a demand for his/her constituency and does something like this, then we can understand. ones who have been in power for very long, shouldn't be doing such thingsprime minister modi, do you think the gst bill which has been stuck for over one and half years, it is a path-breaking economic reform. it unifies the country. recently you met ms jayalalithaa after she was sworn in as the chief minister, mamata banerjee has extended her support for gst and congress allies at the state level are supporting the gst bill. do you feel optimistic that gst bill will be passed in the next session of the parliament?first we need to understand, that we look at gst only within the purview of an economic reform because of which the right information doesn't come out. not having gst straight away means loss for the poor of uttar pradesh. absence of gst straight away means loss for the poor people of bihar. not passing the gst would mean loss for the poor people of poor states like bengal, orissa and assam. people who sit in the rajya sabha must understand this. gst is beneficial for the poor people of the states represented by them, because those states will economically benefit the most from gst. the money will be used for the welfare of the poor people of those states. this is why be it mamata banerjee, be it nitish kumar, be it akhilesh yadav or naveen patnaik, all these states want the gst bill to be passed at the earliest. there is just one group which has made it the issue of prestige. now the kind of arithmetic which is working out, i hope that this decision is passed in favour of the poor. you will be surprised to what extent has the opposition reached to the level of distortion. in the previous session we introduced an act. indian government has rs 40,000 crore rupees from the campa fund. rs 40,000 crore. we wanted to give that money to the states. states have to use that money for forestry, for greenery, for planting trees and plants. the bill is meant for that. had this rs 40,000 crore reached the states before the monsoons, it would have been used for the forests. a lot of people would have got employment, people who plant trees would have been employed. there would be plantation and due to the rains the plants would start growing within a year. but just because of obstructionism, states have been deprived of the benefit of rs 40,000 crore. the money was meant for the forests and for the tribals. they blocked it. there was no argument on itthe reason...you had triedmade all efforts.you had invited former prime minister manmohan singh and sonia gandhi here at the race course roadwe held talks at every levelstill? the word you used 'ego issue', why has it become an ego issue? and people would want to know why is the prime minister unable to end this?the prime minister cannot answer this question. those creating obstructions can only answer this question. but despite this, i will keep trying. i am ready to convince them in which ever way possible. if i have to convoke someone over a cup of tea at their house, i am even ready for that. i have no problem. my only aim is the welfare of the poor of my country and the poor of states like uttar pradesh.you spoke of uttar pradesh. mr prime minister, elections will be held in uttar pradesh in 6,7,8 months. the focus of entire nation will be on it. you are the mp from varanasi. but some comments are made by bjp, some say sangh parivar, some independent groups, communal colour is added to it and not just from one party but from other parties as well. mr prime minister are you going to be able to keep development as the sole agenda? the main issue in the uttar pradesh polls should be that of development, it shouldn't get capsized, the focus shouldn't be elsewhere. are you confident that communal agenda will not overpower development?it's my conviction, it's my commitment. you must have seen during the 2014 elections that i fought elections on the issue of development. the new generation of the country only believes in development. i believe that solution to all problems is in development. development is also the solution to the tension that people talk about. if we provide employment to people, if we ensure there's food on their plates, if we provide them with facilities and give them education, all the tension will end. and this is why, all those who want good for the nation, i request them to compete towards development and for development. this atmosphere should be created in the country and i think such an environment is being created nowadays.so the hot heads who make extreme comments, is there a necessity to control them? so that there is no politics in the name of religionfirstly, i am of the firm belief that the nation should progress on the issue of development. and it is necessary that the country moves forward on the issue of development. i would like to tell the media not to make heroes out of those people who make such comments.but they keep making such commentsdon't make them heroes, they will stopwe don't make them heroes, we make them villains.but why do you make them so big? i see such statements by people on tv, whose faces i haven't even seen and they end up becoming spokesmen on tvself styled spokesmeni don't know why such people are encouragedmr prime minister, let's talk in 2016 of the 2017 elections. after delhi, then bihar, then assam, west bengal. after that we will talk about punjab. before we finish talking about punjab, we will talk about uttar pradesh. then there is the gujarat state election. don't you think that this country is permanently stuck in an electoral cycle? the focus constantly and i want you to reflect on this issue, the focus is on party politics, polarising issues, not on governance. we are a country, if we say, we are constantly in a political campaign mode. is this a good thing? should we break away from it? and what is your view on it?see this is not an issue about narendra modi or the prime minister. and also it is not an issue about a particular party or a particular government.but before the last parliament session, the speaker had called all the parties for a meal. after the agenda meeting everyone was sitting to eat. i had also reached at the same time. while talking casually over food, almost people from all parties said that the central and state elections must be held together. everyone said it. after that during the farewell function of the rajya sabha mps, people from different parties were talking with each other. one of the leaders said, modiji do anything but get us out of this cycle of electionswas that leader from your party?no, he was not from my party. so i said that discussion should happen. what is wrong in that? then one day i said that this was being talked about. this issue has also been discussed in a parliamentary committee. this work has also been started by the election commission and i think they have also writen a letter on it. like in the fight against black money, this issue of elections also gets connected to black money. electoral reforms are necessary if the country has to be rid of black money. it is one of the areas for electoral reforms. i believe that the prime minister cannot take a decision on this and nor should he do that. neither the government can do this. there should be a broad discussion on this and we should not run away from the debate on this continious cycle of elections. the indian voter today is very mature. he votes in one fashion in the lok sabha elections, he votes in a different manner in the state assembly elections. we have seen this. in 2014, the general elections conincided with the odisha assembly elections. the same electorate gave one judgement for odisha and another judgement for delhi. so this country's voter is very mature and we should trust his maturity. there should be a debate on how costs can be reduced by holding simultaneous elections, how the influence of black money can be curbed, how the five years can be spent in taking the country forward. today due to the model code of conduct, there is a loss even in those areas where the code is not applicable. when i was in gujarat, i found that at least 80 to 90 officers were spending two to three months on election duties in other states. this could be happening in every state. so this is an area of concern and some time or the other this question will have to be thought of. i would want the election commission to take this debate forward. they should invite all political parties and hold discussions with everybody and whatever comes out of itcan there be a timebound resolution in this?the election commission will have to invite all political parties to discuss this. the process will get derailed if one party were to initiate thisare you willing to take the lead in building that consensus?despite being the prime minister, i still belong to a political party. the better thing would be for the election commission to initiate this. today the election commission is a very prestigious institution in our country. every political party believes in the election commission and it will further empower this institution and that will be betteri think it is an interesting idea of simultaneous elections. though state parties, regional parties may feel that it will effect them badly. that the national parties like the bjp will gainodisha is the best example. odisha is the best example. in 2014, the bjp had no advantage in the state but the bjp won on the lok sabha seats. this shows the differencemr prime minister how are you keeping your schedule nowadays? i mean you keep a terrifying pace. the number of meetings you hold, people say your officers find it hard to keep upit is not so, it has been 2 years now and everyone is used to the work. i believe that it is such a big country that one must do as much work as possible. so i keep doing thatbefore i come to my last question mr prime minister, one issue that i want to come to is the farmers' crisis. as you are well aware, there has been a crisis in this country, you referred to it. in that speech to your mps, about which i asked you earlier as well, on 20th may in the central hall of parliament you said that 'this government is not for myself, this government is for the poor, we must do something for them.' the farmers' crisis mr prime minster is a reality. i am glad that in this interview you have not avoided the reality, you've faced it, you've talked about it. we have linked our entire future to the monsoons. how do we overcome this from becoming an annual crisis in this country?we will have to put stress on water management here. you must have seen that under the pradhan mantri krishi sinchayi yojana, we have put stress on water issues. during these drought days, i met leaders from 11 states separately and sat with them for about 2-3 hours each. the country would have believed that their prime minister is working even if i had held a meeting with 11 of them together for around 10 minutes. but i didn't do that. i sat with leaders from different states separately to understand specific problems and what we could do for water in those states. i am happy, whichever party the state government affiliated to, all the governments focused a lot on water issues this summer. we will reap its benefits this monsoon. using scientific methods for water accumulation and irrigation, collecting water and directing them towards the fields, everyone did that. micro irrigation is stressed upon. even for sugarcane farming, farmers are slowly moving towards micro irrigation which earlier happened through flood irrigation. paddy crops for which large amount of water is used. today, farmers have started using drip irrigation for it. if we do well in water facilities, then one of the problems is solved. after independence, for the first time, we have brought in pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana which can cover maximum number of farmers. the farmer will have to pay only 2%, only 2%, the government will take care of the rest. the farmers will get an assurance. for instance, in maharashtra, the monsoons are expected in the month of june, the farmers have prepared for everything but haven't started with the sowing process. now if there are no rains till august, so practically his crops have not been damaged, because he did not sow the seeds. but the pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana even takes this into consideration and benefits the farmer. another important aspect, once the crops are harvested, they're cut and kept in the field, assuming it has been a good year for crop growth, with 100% crop production, but it hasn't been loaded on trucks and sent to the market yet. and if it rains, even after 15 days of harvesting, if there is loss, it is covered under pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana. second layer of protection, minimum premium with maximum cover. after independence, for the first time, we have brought in pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana. thirdly, first time we have brought in e-mandi concept. farmer in the village, can sell the crops to the best markets in the country through his mobile phone. farmer would set the price at which the crop would be sold. earlier, farmers used to take the produce on carts or tractors, used to go to a mandi 20-25kms away, then due to storage issues, even if they had to sell for rs 10 less than the price, they used to sell it. now, sitting at home the farmer would know what price to sell the crops at. next point is about, food processing, value addition. we opened up 100% foreign direct investment in food processing. for example, if a farmer is selling tomatoes and if a company is processing tomato ketchup then my farmers would benefit from it. the companies that make aerated drinks, coca-cola, pepsi etc, i requested them to add 5% natural fruit juice. in regions near nagpur and vidarbha where oranges are cultivated, coca-cola is going to add 5% of orange juice. if we add 5% natural juice to aerated water, farmers would get their market and their fruits wouldn't go waste. we should have a comprehensive all-out scheme. so much of our land has been damaged. we have brought in soil health card. we have a soil health abhiyan. the farmer will know the feritility of the land through it. whether a fertilizer needs to be used or not, the farmer will understand. on an average, a farmer with 1 hectare of land will be able to save rs 15000-20000. so we have brought in scientific methods. you would know that in our country, farmers used to be lathicharged when they would go to buy urea and they had to buy it in black. we got urea 100% neem coated. earlier, urea used to go to chemical factories, and the government subsidies were stolen in the name of farmers. after neem coating, urea cannot be used for any other purpose except farming. because of neem coating, there is a qualitative change which helps in healing the damaged land. due to neem coating a piece of land that used 10 kgs of urea can now manage with 7 kgs of urea. all these initiatives are in the direction of agriculture and the results will be seen soon.do you think that the farmers' crisis will be resolved, the question i asked, that it won't be an annual affair, the dependence on monsoons will go down?see agriculture is a state subject. the indian government has taken initiatives, if the state government are enthusiastic to implement this, which i think they will be. as i told you i met leaders from different states and they worked a lot for water issues. if this works, pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana has direct involvement of the central government, it will have great benefits.mr prime minister now i have two questions for you.this has become too long.i'll club these two (questions) together. you're also enjoying it and i am glad you're speaking mr prime minister because there is so much ground to cover and i think viewers would like to hear your view, sir. actually there are three, if you allow me. they're short questions. first is that prime minister narendra modi, how much is politics playing on your mind? in the sense that every prime minister, especially someone who is as forthright as you, looks at the next big challenge. is 2019 anywhere in your mind?those who have seen me in gujarat, and those who have seen me in the last two years, those who see me without any bias, they will know that i am an apolitical prime minister. apart from elections, i don't get involved into politics ever. you can call elections a necessity, a restraint or a responsibility, we have to do it. i attend many functions, go to different areas, you wouldn't have heard any political comment from me. if i go to a government function, i talk about government related topics. if i attend a railways function i talk about railways, if water then water, if water bodies, then water bodies. my focus is on governance. country has been at greatest loss because governments were run only for elections. governments must not run only for elections. the government should be a bona fide attempt of meeting the demands and expectations of the common people. elections should just be a bi-product. it is a democracy. winning and losing is a part of it. it shouldn't be hyped. you would have seen recently i urged everyone to pay taxes before 30th september. i even said it on mann ki baat yesterday. will a person, who is only concerned with winning elections, say that post 30th september you'd face problems?this was also a warning in a way.it is a warning. it is definitely a warning. it is a warning. my first warning is to my government officers to not presume citizens as thieves. i have already given this warning. i have handled my officers first. it took me quite some time. you will be shocked to hear that i have given an early retirement to more than 30 people from income tax department on integrity issues. this isn't a small issue. people who weren't transferred since 20 years, i got them transferred. so, one, my focus is on my system. second, i also tell the country, that for the poor of the nation we would have to give out something for the poor in our country. it is my responsibility to give the people an account of every rupee. i will use it at right places. i won't let it get stolen. but if i need to give houses to the poor, we would need revenue. i don't want to increase taxes, i just want taxes to be paid honestly. there is no need to increase the taxes. the country can run without troubling the citizens. i am working towards it. that is why i have given the citizens a chance to pay the taxes till 30th september, whatever it is rs 10,000 or rs. 50,000. if they think they want to come into mainstream, they must and shouldn't be worried. after 30th september, the government will have to take steps. i will not worry about the polls. i will take the necessary steps. i want to work for the poor in my country.mister prime minister, do some crystal ball gazing for the next three years. for the next three years, to use the cricketing analogy, how do you find your run rate so far and will you have to score at a higher run rate in the next three years to achieve your targets?see, no matte at what speed i move forward, i am never satisfied. if today i run at a speed of 100, i keep an aim of running at 200. i think that the world that was behind us, has gone ahead. we need to run a lot to match that level. so we do not need to calculate. we just need to give it all in. and i have given myself in completely. i've been successful is pulling my entire government in. i believe that the country is also committed to move forwardfinal question to you mr prime minister, what motivates you the most? first of all as i said, will you be able to keep this pace? what motivates you the most and also if you can share with our viewers honestly what is your one greatest source of worry?firstly, i don't live under the burden of worries. problems and challenges are there, you can't deny that. but you must challenge the challenges and not let the challenges turn into worries. this is my principle. i challenge the challenges. i like to face the problems. i don't run away from them. whatever loss i have to face for it, i face it. but i can't leave the country helpless. this responsibility must be taken and i will continue to do so. for all good and bad things, it is my responsibility. i do not regret anything. i believe, people of the country have given me the responsibility and i must fulfill it. thirdly, when i see the poor in our country, it reminds me of the work that i have to do for them. day before yesterday, i was in pune, and met a shrimaan chandrakant ji. a retired teacher with a pension of rs 16000, donates rs 5000 every month for swachh abhiyaan. if a 70 year old retired teacher with children and family at home, without worrying about them, worries about the country, then being the prime minister, i should work a thousand times more than chandrakant ji. this is my inspiration. people of this country who work day and night, they are my inspiration. i look at them and i work even harder.prime minister narendra modi it has been a privilege. i am grateful for this interview.thank youand thank you on behalf of all our viewers that you spoke frankly. the program is frankly speaking and i am thankful to you that you were so frank.i just request you to not create controversies out of this but instead use it for the benefit of the country.please do not think like that. thank you very muchthanks a lot. thank you very much."

In the 250-km-odd distance that the crop moves from villages near Nashik to your local sabziwala in Mumbai, the cost of one kg of onion goes up by close to 400% yes, from Rs 4/kg which a Lasalgaon farmer earns to Rs 18-20/kg which a consumer pays. That's the extent of commissions extracted by middlemen in the food chain.And it's not just the onion trade that sees such artificial inflation. Potato, tomato, green chilly, okra, you name it and pretty much everything in the market goes through a 50-100% increase in prices as it changes hands from one intermediary to the next (see graphic). The irony is that the farmer is the one who gets the lowest prices.So when the Devendra Fadnavis government decided on June 28 to allow growers to sell their produce straight to retail chains and other direct sellers, that's the rent-seeking system that it tried to dismantle. In one fell swoop, it did away with the monopoly of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Companies (APMCs) in every district which manage the marketyards where auctions are held by wholesalers and commissions earned on every transaction.Direct marketer Mahesh Shelke who runs Krushjeevan Agro, an enterprise in which farmers themselves are investors, says, ""Direct marketing companies and farmer producer organizations like ours have gained immense responsibility with the revised rules. More retailers will approach us to source vegetables in order to avoid paying commission to APMC . We know exactly which grower has how many hectares of farmland, what he grows and the quality and quantity of produce. Farmers will get a better price while retailers and consumers will not be burdened by commission either.""The agro economy still works in a way that leaves farmers at the mercy of local agents who decide which crops to grow and when. In the absence of cold chains and storage facilities, growers have to coordinate with them at harvest time. Demand and supply determine farmgate prices; in case of a bumper crop, the farmer has to strike a deal with the agent before he harvests the produce. Since he usually lacks storage space and as the crop is often highly perishable, like say tomato or okra, the agent fixes a suitable price and day on which the crop is picked and transported to the market. For his efforts he ends up earning an approximately 30-100% commission.The agent next strikes a deal with a local trader or ends up hoarding in the event of a dip in prices. In case of vegetables with a longer shelf life, say onion, potato or green chilly, margins tend to be smaller because risk of loss is lower. However, if it is a more perishable commodity such as tomato or okra, the intermediary has less elbow room to negotiate. But if he has control over supplies of a particular produce or stocks from a particular region, he can demand a higher price.Eventually, a deal is made and the goods reach the APMC where wholesalers earn a commission by arranging an auction for the trader. Retailers pick up the produce and wholesalers earn a fixed fee ranging from 6.5% for potato and onion to 8% for other vegetables and 10% for fruits. Now it is this stage of the food chain that the government has specifically sought to do away with.Henceforth, farmers or their agents or even the traders can sell directly to any agency or seller that they want to without paying commissions. But in case a retailer wishes to use the APMC to buy goods, he would have to pay the commission instead. Now this may in turn get passed on to consumers. Wholesalers and retailers have called a meeting with traders on Saturday to discuss the matter.Subhash Deshmukh, minister for cooperation and marketing said to TOI, ""There is some confusion over payment of tax (commission) but it is between the traders and retailers and not at the government level.

The government is ready to provide more funds to ensure procurement.The decisions came after Wednesday's meeting convened by finance minister Arun Jaitley to deal with the surging prices of some vegetables and food items.""The government has approved import of 3 lakh tonnes green lentil, 2 lakh tonnes yellow peas, 1 lakh tonne red lentil and 20,000 tonnes each of arhar and urad,"" consumer affairs secretary Hem Pandey said.Two teams will soon visit Myanmar and Mozambique, he said, to finalise long-term supply contracts.

Since mid-August this year, every week, the lot between the Vidhan Bhavan and Inox theatre is transformed into a bustling bazaar of more than 30 stalls with farmers selling a staggering range of local and seasonal produce.We joined the throng of people shopping for their weekly veggies, and marveled at the glistening tomatoes, fat sitaphals, fresh cluster beans, and pumpkins the size of Ravanas head, that jostled for space with mounds of lettuce, stacks of asparagus, and luscious-looking purple cabbage.Apart from the usual suspects, there was some wonderful indigenous produce. We found some early green mogri (as the Gujaratis call it), which I had last eaten in Delhi. Winter vegetables, these radish pods are spicy: the purple ones add a nice bite to raitas while the green ones are cooked into a vegetable, usually with brinjals.

While onions are selling for for Rs. 2 - Rs. 6 in the wholesale market and averaging Rs. 12 in retail outlets, a kg of tomatoes is going for a relatively high Rs. 25 a kilo.Based on the trading price last season, farmers changed their crop patterns growing more onions and fewer tomatoes, leading to an imbalance in the supply-demand cycle. This, in turn, has affected prices, say traders.The crash in onion prices is the result of glut in the market. Last year at this time, onions were selling at Rs. 60 to Rs. 80 a kg. However, traders say that the high prices onions fetched last year is the precise reason why this year has seen rates plummet. Its a cycle. Following the high prices for onions last year, the acreage of onions has increased many fold this year across regions in Maharashtra, North Karnataka and Chitradurga. We have also seen a good crop across regions and the market is being flooded with onions, resulting in the crashing prices, said Ravi Kumar, of Bangalore Potato and Onion Traders Association, APMC, Yeshwantpur.Cauvery issueThe Cauvery dispute also played a role in this scenario. Tamil Nadu is one of the major buyers of onions from Karnataka. However, owing to Cauvery dispute, the movement of goods was disrupted, taking away a major market, which has further led to the crash, Mr. Kumar added.The situation is so bad that many farmers in North Karnataka are not even harvesting the crop, for that will only add to their losses. Despite having a good yield, several of them are forced to leave the crop as it is and plough the farmland so that it can become manure for the next season in Hubballi and surrounding districts.With tomatoes, the situation is the exact opposite. Following a period of prices that were as low as Rs. 6 a kg in the wholesale market, tomatoes are now selling at Rs. 25 in the wholesale market and Rs. 30 in the retail market.A senior procurement officer with a prominent retail chain in the city said that following the low prices during the last crop, many farmers in Kolar and Devanahalli belt did not grow them this season. Tomato is a three month crop.Muniswamy Gowda, a farmer in Devanahalli, who has planted tomatoes said that the acreage had reduced by more than 70 per cent for the present crop in his area, and has fetched him a good price.Furthermore, the lack of rain and humidity has brought down the quantity of the crop resulting in climbing rates for the available crop, said N.N.

She says, Theres this whole other conversation where you can say what you eat is how you feel, and what you are.The scale of the undertaking cant be experienced in a single dish, though the Andaman Island Tuna Poke Bowl gives you a fair idea of the complexities involved: from sourcing and transporting fish from the Andamans to substituting traditional rice for red rice, to serving it with lightly fermented carrots. Seven months of intensive research have gone into formulating recipes for everything from soda to bread.The same can be said of the devotion put into sourcing the produce at Kitchen Garden. The crockery has been brought from Vietnam the bread is as a crusty sourdough is airy and moist (the breads are organic). The kitchen turns out only 20 loaves a day, though that is set to expand. Also on the menu is ciabatta bread, though not the flaky croissants that are available at Suzette. This is in keeping with the healthy focus of Kitchen Garden, where even the bread is made from three ingredients: wheat and rye flour, salt and water.Sabaggh says, I started attending bread classes in France in 2012, working on baguettes and everything like croissants for Suzette. And then I did some internships in Paris. This led to a second internship in Paris with a baker who is totally crazy guy, very passionate and working only with sourdough. Its this tutelage that has led to the sourdough that is served at the restaurant.Ratra and Sabaggh are committed to the quality of their product. Sabaggh says, With Kitchen Garden, the idea is to do something more urban, maybe a bit more young. More international, less French. Where we can do something like soba noodles, that we are doing here, or ciabatta breads or twisted hummus or have some edamame, or veggies, which were not exactly, fitting our Suzette concept.That said, there are some things from Suzette that theyre carrying over. The reason why we kept the by Suzette [label] is that we want people to know that this is the same way of making things, always from scratch, using organic products, never using shortcuts to make food, no artificial flavours, no ready-made stuff. We dont have ready-made stuff, I dont like that.Good for your gutThe focus of the food at 212 All Good is that it should be good for your gut. The team has worked on fermentation of vegetables as well as things like kefir, a fermented milk drink made with yeast. Tacos, all-day breakfast, salads are available for a dining experience that is similar to the one you would have at any of the malls other eateries, but with ingredients that are free from preservatives.Both restaurants work with suppliers to bring farm fresh ingredients to their customers. At Kitchen Garden, cherry tomatoes to cheeses are supplied from a farm in Gujarat. The vegetables, grains and meats are brought from farmers in Maharashtra and close by. If it is not possible to get quality ingredients locally, for example Haas avocados, Parmesan cheese, its imported.At 212 All Good, everything is sourced locally, be it cheese, fish or vegetables. Salmon was dropped from the menu as it could not be sourced from the country. Behind the bar, tetrapacks of juice have been banished in favour of freshly squeezed juices and even bitters are being made in-house.If this signals anything, it is that city consumers are looking to eat out, but not at the expense of their health. Sabaggh sums it up, What we discovered also from clients in Mumbai is that people really know what they want, and they like to experiment.Both restaurants offer something for everyone: catering to diets that range from vegan to keto to gluten free.

58f67d9d7be9e031f13b5ca9,The bitter story of Nagpur Orange,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/The-bitter-story-of-Nagpur-Orange/articleshow/54271608.cms,2016-09-11,,The Times Of India,"""Greatest ornament of the garden is a description of orange tree called Cintra (santra) or Coolang. Its fruit is very juicy and of exquisite flavour. There is a floating notion that it was introduced by the Portuguese. Some however, believe that the great superiority of the orange is owing to a system of grafting and budding in which local gardeners of Nagpore are pre-eminently skilful,"" wrote Englishman Major Henry Bevan following his visit to Nagpur in 1818.Brought here by the Bhonsalas -- the erstwhile rulers of the region -- from the North-East in the 19th century, oranges made Nagpur famous. Cut to 2014 when it bagged the geographical indication (GI) tag giving its growers here the sole right to use the words 'Nagpur Orange'. Little has changed after that. Though not as worse as the cotton grower who is often pushed to suicide, the orange farmer is also not spared by the vagaries of nature and uncertain market. Last year, a glut led to rates crashing to Rs4 to5 a kg.If the Alphonso mango grown in Konkan region and grapes of Nashik have an established export market, the Nagpur Santra remains their poor cousin.The orange crop grows twice a year. The fruit available from September to December is Ambiya which has a slightly sour taste. It is followed by the sweeter Mrig crop in January. Normally, farmers go for either of the two varieties. In the last 10 years, large-scale orange cultivation has begun in Rajasthan too, giving Nagpur Orange some competition.The demand for setting up a major processing centre in Vidarbha is an old one. Two years ago, a facility by Citrus India Private Limited started at Nanded in Marathwada region where orange growing is a recent affair. Now, as Patanjali Ayurved plans to make juice out of the oranges grown in Nagpur district and other regions of Vidarbha, there is much hope for the farmers, even though earlier players have failed to successfully market the same product.The first organized attempt was made in the 1960s when farmers came together to form the Nagpur Orange Growers' Association (NOGA) with its plant at Motibagh in north Nagpur. NOGA ran into losses and the government took over it in 1972, bringing it under the Maharashtra Agro-Based Industries Development Corporation (MAIDC).NOGA, with its new plant in Hingna, was once known for its bottles of orange squash and juice. Now, tomato ketchup is its mainstay product. NOGA's line of juices, which are sold in cans, are out of the shelves in shops and are now sold only to institutional buyers like hotels and government agencies. Squash has a small retail market with 50,000 bottles made in a year. There are 3-4 smaller units which hardly have any influence.Sources say NOGA could not compete with juices in tetra packs which took over the market. Cans became old fashioned and NOGA did not have enough funds to invest in a tetra pack unit. The golden days of NOGA ended more than a decade ago. A plant started in Katol in 1998 is also shut.The Nagpur orange has a peculiar feature of leaving a bitter taste in the juice. Limonin in the fibre and seeds brings about this taste. In a commercial unit, the seeds and fibre cannot be removed, or consequently, the bitterness reduced. At least NOGA couldn't and thus lost out to competition. ""The squash which is sweetened with chemicals sells more,"" a source said.""These days, de-bittering units are available, again a major investment,"" said the source. Industry experts say limonin is present in other citrus fruits too and the problem has been addressed long back.The National Citrus Research Centre (NRCC), which has its experimental farms off Amravati Road, was set up in 1985 after a major pest attack in the early 1980s. Now upgraded to a central institute, some say here that it has not come up with a counter to the bitter taste so far. Though a seedless variety has been developed, it is expected to be available for commercial cultivation only after a couple of years.""De-bittering facility is easily available in the market so it should not be a constraint anymore. Like Nanded, a plant can also be set up in Nagpur,"" says Manoj Jawanjal, the director of Mahaorange , a state government marketing agency, and also an orange grower.At present, the majority of units making juices import the fruit contents. Imports are cheaper due to low customs duty. ""In order to protect the local growers, government should impose a higher tax on imports,"" he said.""The orange lobby has not been as strong as grape growers of western Maharashtra. A market for pomegranate and grapes was created by the growers there. Initially, the growers also paid for the losses incurred by traders who exported their produce. Now, there is an established market for these fruits. Those in Western Maharashtra had a political backing. It can happen for oranges too but there has to be support from the government,"" said Jawanjal.""Mahaorange recently exported oranges to Sri Lanka but there is s a long way to go. For getting the advantage of GI tag, an export market has to be established first. At present, the local farmers do not have much awareness about GI and its advantages,"" he said.""It's not juices alone, even orange peel and seeds can get a good price for the farmers,"" says Amitabh Pawde, an engineer-turned-farmer in the orange belt of Narkhed, over 60 km from Nagpur.""The peel can be used for making high-end cosmetics. Orange peel oil is a costly product and, once dried, talcum powder too can be made from it. At present, the raw materials are imported. There are small units which do not make any difference. Any major player in personal care segment, buying the raw material from Vidarbha, can change the dynamics of orange growing here,"" said Pawde.Pawde cited a recent research which says limonin, the bittering element in oranges, can cure kidney stones too.Even as bigger plans may still take some time, farmers say even their day-to-day problems have not been addressed entirely. ""A large number of farmers are close to forest areas and Nilgai (blue bulls) are a major pest destroying the orange trees which are short in height. Subsidy for drip irrigation is also is not available,' says Sanjay Dhote from Katol.","""greatest ornament of the garden is a description of orange tree called cintra (santra) or coolang. its fruit is very juicy and of exquisite flavour. there is a floating notion that it was introduced by the portuguese. some however, believe that the great superiority of the orange is owing to a system of grafting and budding in which local gardeners of nagpore are pre-eminently skilful,"" wrote englishman major henry bevan following his visit to nagpur in 1818.brought here by the bhonsalas -- the erstwhile rulers of the region -- from the north-east in the 19th century, oranges made nagpur famous. cut to 2014 when it bagged the geographical indication (gi) tag giving its growers here the sole right to use the words 'nagpur orange'. little has changed after that. though not as worse as the cotton grower who is often pushed to suicide, the orange farmer is also not spared by the vagaries of nature and uncertain market. last year, a glut led to rates crashing to rs4 to5 a kg.if the alphonso mango grown in konkan region and grapes of nashik have an established export market, the nagpur santra remains their poor cousin.the orange crop grows twice a year. the fruit available from september to december is ambiya which has a slightly sour taste. it is followed by the sweeter mrig crop in january. normally, farmers go for either of the two varieties. in the last 10 years, large-scale orange cultivation has begun in rajasthan too, giving nagpur orange some competition.the demand for setting up a major processing centre in vidarbha is an old one. two years ago, a facility by citrus india private limited started at nanded in marathwada region where orange growing is a recent affair. now, as patanjali ayurved plans to make juice out of the oranges grown in nagpur district and other regions of vidarbha, there is much hope for the farmers, even though earlier players have failed to successfully market the same product.the first organized attempt was made in the 1960s when farmers came together to form the nagpur orange growers' association (noga) with its plant at motibagh in north nagpur. noga ran into losses and the government took over it in 1972, bringing it under the maharashtra agro-based industries development corporation (maidc).noga, with its new plant in hingna, was once known for its bottles of orange squash and juice. now, tomato ketchup is its mainstay product. noga's line of juices, which are sold in cans, are out of the shelves in shops and are now sold only to institutional buyers like hotels and government agencies. squash has a small retail market with 50,000 bottles made in a year. there are 3-4 smaller units which hardly have any influence.sources say noga could not compete with juices in tetra packs which took over the market. cans became old fashioned and noga did not have enough funds to invest in a tetra pack unit. the golden days of noga ended more than a decade ago. a plant started in katol in 1998 is also shut.the nagpur orange has a peculiar feature of leaving a bitter taste in the juice. limonin in the fibre and seeds brings about this taste. in a commercial unit, the seeds and fibre cannot be removed, or consequently, the bitterness reduced. at least noga couldn't and thus lost out to competition.

We've had enough of those, really . Newage eateries are using a host of exciting ingredients from across the world and far-flung corners of our country  from Bulgur wheat to kokum, unagi to chorizo and more -to rustle up lip-smacking delicacies that will leave you surprised, excited and craving for more! Check these out...SRIRACHA, FROM ASIABUFFALO WINGSBODEGA CANTINA Y BARSriracha, a spicy sauce, is definitely one of the biggest food trends in India this year. Sriracha is highly flavoured, and is used extensively in Thai cuisine. For Bodega Cantina's Buffalo wings, they home-make the Sriracha. ""Our Sriracha is inspired by the original and made with different kinds of chilii and vinegars and then fermented for a long time,"" says owner Urvika Kanoi.LAVASH, FROM WEST ASIALAVASH CRACKERSCRAVE FOODWORKSLavash is a kind of flatbread that is widely consumed through the entire region. Though it is commonly believed to be Armenian in origin, food experts also claim that it has Iranian roots.The lavash crackers at Crave Foodworks are a relatively newer take on the soft flatbread, that's crispy and spicy, and can be had with or without dips or sauces. In this restaurant, it is served with classic hummus or labneh.GUNKAN AND NORI, FROM JAPANIKURA GUNKAN MAKIFUJIGunkan maki is a more complex kind of sushi, commonly known as battleship or warship sushi. Ikura, which is salmon roe or the fully ripe egg mass of the fish -just like caviar -is one of the more uncommon soft toppings used to make this sushi. Another uncommon ingredient used is the nori -a Japanese edible seaweed which comes in sheets. If you are all for gastronomic adventures, this one should be on top of your must-check-out list.KOKUM, FROM THE WESTERN GHATSKOKUM RITASPICE KRAFTIf you are a fan of the ubiquitous margarita, but also have a taste for the indigenous, Chef and owner Sambit Banick will recommend to you the Kokum Rita.""To the classic cocktail, we had a very interesting twist -that of the kokum fruit. I get my kokum saar, which is the extract of the Indian fruit from Khamkaar in Mumbai, a very old and well-known shop that stocks all kinds of pickles and spices. It is authentic and we use to it serve our indigenous take on the Margarita,"" says chef Sambit.BULGUR WHEAT, FROM WEST ASIATABBOULEHCALCUTTA STORIESBulgur wheat originated in Bulgaria and is a broken wheat rich in fibre. Bulgur is a common ingredient in Armenian, Assyrian, Kurdish, Syrian, Israeli, Jordanian, Palestinian, Lebanese, Turkish, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean dishes. For Tabbouleh, which is essentially a salad, the wheat is steamed and tossed with three-coloured bell peppers, cucumbers and black and green olives. Now that's what you call a bowl of freshness.CHIA SEEDS, FROM MESOAMERICASUGARFREE FIG AND DATE KULFICAFE PRANAHChia seeds come from a flowering plant of the mint family, which is native to Mexico and Guatemala. Rich in B vitamins, omega 3 fatty acids and loads of other healthy stuff, these seeds are traditionally used in drinks and sherbets. At Cafe Pranah, they use it in the sugarfree fig and date kulfi. ""It is a body coolant and adds a beautiful textural contrast to the richness of the kulfi,"" informs Rahul Arora, chef and owner of the cafe.QUINOA, FROM LATIN AMERICAQUINOA SALADHAKUNA MATATAGradually, but steadily, Kolkata is waking up to the quinoa phenomenon. A gluten free, organically grown seed, it is used in food in the capacity of a grain. The history of this seed goes back to the Inca empire, when it was known as the mother of all food, given its nutrient-rich status. At Hakuna Matata, the quinoa salad also has rocket leaves, grilled veggies, tomato, cucumber and pomegranate yoghurt dressing.PS: Nasa scientists are reportedly looking at quinoa as a plant to be grown in space.DUXELLE FROM FRANCE & MIRIN FROM JAPANSTIR FRIED SCALLIONS WITH MUSHROOM DUXELLE, SPICY MIRIN REDUCTIONSPICE KRAFTAt Spice Kraft, chef and owner Sambit Banick makes it a point to mix and marry cuisines. For their stir-fried scallions and mushroom duxelle, with spicy mirin reduction, the marriage is between classic French duxelles and a spicy Asian sauce. For the duxelle, the mushrooms are chopped and cooked in butter and made into a paste. Then, to add to it a zing of Asian flavour, a reduction of mirin is used. Served on canapes, it's sprinkled with stir-fried scallions.WILD RED RICE, FROM NORTHEAST INDIAWILD RED RICESANTA'S FANTASEAA tribal dish, the wild red rice is big in the northeast food scene. It's unpolished, unlike the white rice we commonly use. ""The unpolished dhenki-chhaat chaal is full of nutrients. It might not look very shiny, but it is much better for our health,"" says Kaushik Ghosh, owner of Santa's Fantasea. In this restaurant, it is served with a gravy that is made from traditional northeastern herbs and the superhot bhut jolokia, or raja mirchi, as it is known in Nagaland.CHORIZO, FROM SPAINCHICKPEA CHORIZOBODEGA CANTINA Y BARA Spanish pork sausage, chorizo is increasingly becoming one of the staples at new-age restaurants in Kolkata. It is spicy, made from coarsely ground pork and seasoned with chili and paprika. It is widely used in Spanish and Mexican cuisine. ""Chorizos are centuries old, but it is relatively new on India's palette. We buy it from a Spanish couple in Bangalore, who make the chorizos themselves, to preserve the authentici ty. The spicy pork goes wonderfully with the flavours of chickpea, and present it as tapas,"" shares Urvika Kanoi, head chef and owner of Bodega Cantina Y Bar.CHIMICHURRI, FROM ARGENTINACHIMICHURRI PRAWNSSMOKE HOUSE DELIThis is an Argentinian sauce, which is used as a dip with fried fish or grills. In Smoke House Deli, they make it from scratch, which is their take on the original chimichurri, and use it as a marinade for prawns.""The prawns are marinated in this sauce for 30 minutes, before being grilled and baked,"" said head chef Fatik Mir. Apart from infusing the prawns with a burst of flavours, the vibrant green chimichurri contrasts with the slight pinkish shade of the prawns.UNAGI, FROM JAPANUNAGI NIGIRIFUJISorry to burst your bubble, but Unagi is not the total state of concentration that Ross of FRIENDS claimed to have mastered. It is actually a freshwater eel that is a very common component of Japanese seafood. If that makes you squeamish, remember that Fuji uses this fish with wasabi, gari, rice and sushi vinegar to make a nigiri, which is also another form of sushi. Not take a look at the plate, doesn't this look like art on a plate?RIBOTIDE, FOOD ADDITIVENACHOS WITH CHEESE SAUCECREAM CENTREThe controversy surrounding MSG, a flavour enhancer widely used in southeast Asian cuisine, came as a huge blow to Chinese restaurants and food manufacturers. But then, as they say, when one door closes, another opens up. So now there are powder flavor enhancers in the market, known as Ribotides. These can be used in a way similar to MSG and are considered safe. It is a Japanese derivative and is used in the cheese sauce of Cream Centre, which is served with their nachos. Though the nachos cheese and mozzarella cheese here are both customized with secret ingredients, at least we know that they use a highly expensive flavour enhancer, which accounts for their huge fan following!COUSCOUS, FROM NORTH AFRICAVEGETABLE TAGINE WITH COUSCOUSTHE FACTORY OUTLETCouscous has been a part of Kolkata's menu for quite some time now. However, with the trend moving from traditional grains such as wheat and rice to uncommon ones such as quinoa and buckwheat, couscous is also getting its share of limelight. A traditional North African dish, it is made of moulds of semolina and flour. A dish in itself, more and more restaurants are deconstructing it to suit Indian palettes. It can be served with broth, veggies or meat. Sometimes it's had just by itself -a bowl of comfort food.

With minor changes to our methods, we have ensured tasty yet healthy food.The canteen is managed by a 10-strong team of police personnel who oversee procurement and preparation, hygiene and day-to-day work.

But going beyond these popular sweets and the culinary versatility of sesame will thrill the cook in you. Sesame indicum , the cultivated type, which originated in India, continues to be an ingredient of significance today.A wonderful ingredient, sesame is extremely versatile, lending itself to both sweet and savoury dishes. Sprinkle it whole on salads, or knead into chapati dough. Make spice mixes to fortify the flavour and health of your meals. One sprinkle Im hooked to is gomasio, a condiment from Japan, in which toasted sesame is ground coarsely with salt. I just combine coarse sea salt and toasted sesame in a bottle and keep it within reach. Its perfect with anything from a simple bowl of brown rice to salads, noodles, steamed vegetables, even khichdi. Another favourite is the Middle Eastern zaatar (a mix of herbs and spices), a condiment popularly combined with olive oil and smeared on flat bread. Zaatar is also used to flavour meat and vegetables dishes, on labneh (a thick hung yogurt cheese) or fried eggs as a garnish. I toast sesame with dried thyme and salt and grind with amchur instead of the sumac that is traditionally used but not easily found in India. It works perfectly on naans, kulchas, and in raitas. I also like to sprinkle it on chunks of paneer or chicken and grill them.Grinding toasted sesame opens up many more options. Although south India is best known for its use of sesame, I discovered, after I married into a Garhwali family, that the cuisine of Uttarakhand uses a lot of ground sesame in its winter dishes. Crushed sesame adds a nutty accent to lobia khichdi. The piquant khatte aloo is made of potatoes tossed in yogurt, toasted sesame and chillies. And then there is addictive til ki chutney in which toasted sesame is ground with toasted cumin, ginger, green chillies, and the juice of the bada nimbu (large wild lemons that come into season in the winter). Another lovely dish is the earthy pinni ka saag that is made from pinni or compressed seed cakes left over from the oil extraction process of sesame. With the oil removed, these become extremely high in protein and dietary fibre. Grind sesame until it gives forth oil and you get tahini or sesame butter, a staple ingredient in Middle Eastern cuisine. Stir it into soups, or dips, or add honey to make a quick spread for toast or dip for fruit. I am endlessly confounded that we have been pressing sesame for oil for millennia but never thought of toasting the seed prior to extracting its oil, something that the rest of Asia has savoured for centuries. Toasted sesame oil is the most magical ingredient. The roasting process intensifies the inherent flavour of sesame and is used more as a condiment or flavouring oil. It quickly grows into being indispensible: drizzle over fried eggs, add to vinaigrettes for a delicious variation, swirl a few drops into soups it pairs well with any flavour but is especially good with Asian, tomato and clear soups.And we already know sesames nutty flavours work wonderfully in sweet dishes; our laddoos and chikkis are testimony to this. But sesame is also popular in sweets around the world. In the Middle East you will find sesame halva; which, unlike Indian halvas, come in large dry blocks from which portions are sliced off. They literally melt into a nutty, sweet toffee and glide down your throat. Addictive! In Asian cuisine, a favourite dessert is the sweet black sesame soup of Cantonese cuisine. Asian supermarkets worldwide usually carry instant mix packets but I have made it at home by boiling crushed black sesame or toasted unhusked sesame with water, sweetened with honey or jaggery. It is a great dessert for children.We should be eating a lot more of this super food, not just saving it for festive occasions.If you hate milk like I do, sesame offers a great substitute with three times the calcium content of milk. Plus, one tablespoon of sesame contains 52 calories, 88 mg calcium, 1.3 mg iron and 32 mg magnesium.

The bunny was born of South African apartheid, a time when blacks and whites werent allowed to dine together. It took the enterprising wiles of an Indian businessman in Durban to invent the bunny chow, a cheap, nourishing take-away dish for poor black customers.

Nestled within each plump, meticulously-braided crescent of pizza dough is a mound of mozzarella and tomatoes; the whole thing is then baked until the crust turns pale gold in colour. The beauty of the calzone is that almost anything can be used as filling  cold cuts, anchovies, capers, eggs, whatever you like. At Yellow Bar All Day, you get a tomato sauce, cheese and olive filling stuffed into a crispy crust.Where: Yellow Bar All Day, Khar, 30151199GyrosTake a warm pocket of pita. Add tender, juicy, delicate slices of pork, beef or chicken shaved fresh from the grill. Splash on tzatziki or Greek yoghurt. Gingerly eye the other available toppings  onion, tomato, fried potato, bacon etc. Add at will. Consume. Smile.Gyros is what happens when one food culture seeps into another. The vertical rotisserie, invented by the Turks, led to the birth of the doner kebab.

Although hot dogs have been around since the 19th century, it was Nathans famous hot dog stand in Coney Island that propelled them to iconic status. Today, of course, hot dog stands are everywhere  at baseball games, at amusement parks, on busy streets, serving juicy pork sausage spiked with garlic and slick with mustard, ketchup and pickle relish, all resting on a cushion of bread. Thats the classic, but wherever you go in North America, youll find different takes: dogs with coleslaw, dogs with chilli sauce, dogs with avocados and refried beans (surprisingly good), even dogs with fries and cheese i.e. a poutine dog if you will. In Mumbai, you get hot dogs everywhere and most come with a sweet relish and caramelised onions such as at Versovas Jam Jar Diner. You get a posh one at AKA that comes served on a black slate, with griddled tomatoes and a parcel of salad on the side. Theres even a festive one available at Desi Deli, of pork and apple sausage, pear and cranberry relish.Where: Jam Jar Diner, Versova, 26368880; AKA, Worli, 24901994; Desi Deli, Bandra, 26408333PoutineThere is only one way to wade into the waters of Quebecois street food and that way is poutine. Poutines kind of a hot mess (the word literally means mess, a gadbad or ghotala ), a nest of slightly thick-cut fries drenched in an avalanche of warm, brown gravy and cheese curds, and naturally, the best way to eat it is to throw away your fork and knife and plunge your fingers into the scrum. Theres nothing quite like it to soak up the alcohol after a debauched night at the club. Try it at Social, where home fries are blanketed by a layer of melted cheese (Classic). The poutine at the Bar Stock Exchange comes crowned by cheese, gravy and a layer of onions.Where: Social, Colaba 22828484, Bar Stock Exchange, Andheri, Kurla, Saki Naka, Colaba, Bandra, 28501214TacoA very long time ago, a canny Mexican discovered that corn flour tortillas tasted pretty awesome when eaten with a pile of meat. But it was much later, in the 1940s, that entrepreneurs discovered that the tortilla, when folded over and fried, lasted longer and tasted better. And thus was born the taco of today  a fellowship of wheat or corn flour shell with a heap of charred meat or seafood, smothered in salsa and topped with finely-chopped onion, cilantro and tomatoes. In short, it tastes sublime. Back in the Bay, youll find tacos at Bombay Blue, Chilis, Jam Jar Diner and Old Wild West, among others.

It was a winter morning in Madrid and I was dragging my frozen way to a cafe, when all at once, I noticed a snake of people loafing outside a stall. Within were two huge kadhais filled with hot oil that was spitting and bubbling, and a harried churrero squeezing choux dough into the angry ooze. But from that volcano emerged the churros, piping hot, honey coloured, star-shaped fingers of sweet, crunchy, crumbly softness.

Two weeks on, his business is being hammered by the ensuing cash crunch.Sales at Somani's aluminium foil maker, Rockdude Impex, have fallen by roughly a quarter in the past week, and the cash shortage that followed the ""demonetisation"" drive has left his supply chain in tatters: his trucks are stranded with no money for fuel, workers won't load goods for free, and distributors can't pay up.Modi's move on Nov. 8 was aimed at cracking down on corruption and flushing out funds stashed away in India's ""black economy"". But the cancellation of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes ($7.3 and $14.7), more than 80 percent of currency in circulation, threatens to push Asia's third-largest economy into a liquidity crisis.Consumer spending makes up 56 percent of India's $2 trillion economy. But with just the small stock of smaller denomination notes available and a struggle to get hold of new bills, consumers are holding back.The government has acknowledged that the disruption would last weeks because of delays in note printing and technical problems with ATM machines, but Modi has made a plea for patience until Dec. 30. The government said it could not have printed new notes or recalibrated cash machines in advance for fear of the move leaking out.Meanwhile, supply chains at small, medium and even larger companies are breaking down, underlining just how much corporate India - not just the shadow economy - relies on hard cash.""The entire supply chain has broken,"" said Somani, who employs 150 people across India from his base outside Mumbai.Problems at Rockdude go from its network of suppliers to its 1,500 distributors and 150 stockists. Its sales team, spread from Delhi to Nagaland in the east and all the way to the south, is rapidly running short of cash to promote a planned new product, even for the rickshaw rides they use to travel.Revenues have frozen, Somani says, but fixed costs continue, including wages. These are paid online, but his staff cannot get access without being given time off to queue at the bank.""We are cutting production,"" he added. ""If this goes on for two more months, then it will hit us very badly.""An executive at a mid-sized hair oil manufacturer, a beauty staple in India, said sales had crumpled as consumers simply stopped buying shampoos and lotions.

Brokerage Ambit Capital says it does not rule out a contraction in the October-December quarter.Corporate operating profits are tipped to fall by as much as 40 percent in the current quarter.People ranging from taxi drivers and street hawkers to big consumer goods firms have seen their earnings plummet by as much as 80 percent in the first week of the swap alone, according to some analysts' estimates.Those relying on informal, cash-based channels are, unsurprisingly, worst hit. Greengrocer Ranveer Singh, who regularly borrows money to run his shop in New Delhi, sold vegetables on credit to regular customers in the first two days after the cash crackdown, but has been forced to shut up shop.""I don't have cash to refill stocks,"" said Singh, who used to make about $15 a day before the crackdown began.""If it remains like this for two more weeks, my family might have to go without food.""But even for more sophisticated firms, paying employees is a major challenge, and not just in the construction and building materials sectors, which still pay contractors in cash.As most Indians do not have bank accounts, most are paid in cash, though reliable statistics are hard to come by.With the government changing rules for currency withdrawals and exchange almost every day, Somani and others are struggling.Chandubhai Kothia, head of chemicals company Shree Ganesh Chemicals in Gujarat, with an annual turnover of 1 billion rupees, said a newly imposed 50,000 rupee cash withdrawal limit per week for some businesses that came in as part of the measures was simply not enough.""The payment of wages to workers and transport are a problem,"" he said.While Modi has promised the cash situation would become normal by year-end, Saumitra Chaudhuri, a former economic adviser to the government, estimates it will take six months to replace the stock of cancelled bills.EARNINGS CRUNCHEDSome analysts are already reviewing their estimate of company earnings for the rest of the year.Brokerage Motilal Oswal warned this week that its forecast of a revival in corporate earnings in the second half of the fiscal year 2016/17 was now in jeopardy, with autos, retail, consumer goods, cement, telecom and non-banking financial companies likely to see downgrades.India's vast services sector, which accounts for two-thirds of GDP, is worst hit.Credit Suisse estimates more than 90 percent of consumer purchases are made in cash as few Indians have bank cards and infrastructure for online transactions is poor.In Gurgaon's Cyber Hub, a corporate leisure centre, several eateries reported a crash in their card swiping machines, compelling them to decline customers who didn't have sufficient smaller denomination bills.In rural areas, where cash is totally dominant, the situation is worse.In the wheat-growing states, sales of seeds and fertiliser have plunged halfway through the sowing season as farmers told Reuters they had run out of cash.As the crunch continues, more are beginning to ask whether the government could have done more to ease the impact.""The Prime Minister to my mind has done an income tax raid in every house in the country,"" said Abhishek Saraf, joint managing director of SquareFoot, a flooring-maker in Mumbai.","a labourer sleeps on baskets of unsold tomatoes at a wholesale market in manchar village in the western state of maharashtra, india.(photo|reuters)mumbai/new delhi: like millions of indians fed up with corruption and counterfeiting, vimal somani cheered prime minister narendra modi's shock move to replace all high-value banknotes. two weeks on, his business is being hammered by the ensuing cash crunch.sales at somani's aluminium foil maker, rockdude impex, have fallen by roughly a quarter in the past week, and the cash shortage that followed the ""demonetisation"" drive has left his supply chain in tatters: his trucks are stranded with no money for fuel, workers won't load goods for free, and distributors can't pay up.modi's move on nov. 8 was aimed at cracking down on corruption and flushing out funds stashed away in india's ""black economy"". but the cancellation of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes ($7.3 and $14.7), more than 80 percent of currency in circulation, threatens to push asia's third-largest economy into a liquidity crisis.consumer spending makes up 56 percent of india's $2 trillion economy. but with just the small stock of smaller denomination notes available and a struggle to get hold of new bills, consumers are holding back.the government has acknowledged that the disruption would last weeks because of delays in note printing and technical problems with atm machines, but modi has made a plea for patience until dec. 30. the government said it could not have printed new notes or recalibrated cash machines in advance for fear of the move leaking out.meanwhile, supply chains at small, medium and even larger companies are breaking down, underlining just how much corporate india -

58fef5217be9e0420db2a12a,Caterpillar cloud on tomatoes,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160616/jsp/nation/story_91510.jsp,2016-06-16,,Telegraph,"UNDER SCANNER New Delhi, June 15: Government scientists have called for nationwide surveillance to look for a caterpillar native to South America that has slipped into at least four Indian states and could threaten the country's tomato growers and the ketchup-and-puree industries. The scientists at the National Bureau of Agricultural Insect Resources (NBAIR), Bangalore, worried about the pest's spread, have also initiated efforts to get wasps and predatory bugs to serve as its natural enemies and design long-lasting sex traps to suppress its population. The pest, Tuta absoluta, emerging from Peru's Andean region, reached Spain in 2006, then spread to France, Italy, and Greece, jumped across the Mediterranean into northern Africa, moved into eastern Africa and the Middle-East before it was spotted in Maharashtra in 2014. Since then, scientists have observed the pest - also called the tomato pinworm or leafminer - on farms across Gujarat, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu where they have caused slight to extreme damage, even in fields where farmers had sprayed pesticides. ""It is unclear why this is so. It is possible the pest is resistant to the specific pesticides that were sprayed, or the pesticides may have killed predators that could have been natural enemies of this pest,"" Chandish Ballal, a senior entomologist at the NBAIR, told The Telegraph. Ballal and her colleagues have called for intensive surveillance efforts to look for this pest in major tomato-growing states such as Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. Although the pest prefers tomatoes, scientists have seen it feed on potatoes and eggplants (brinjals) in other countries. Tomato farmers across the country and the ketchup, sauce, and puree industries may face a serious threat if this pest is not controlled, the NBAIR researchers have warned in a paper published on Sunday in Current Science, a journal published by the Indian Academy of Sciences. The pinworm's rapid spread has caused concern among crop scientists across the world. Last year, plant protection scientists and policy-makers met in Berlin, Germany, and decided to intensify quarantine measures and explore the effectiveness of using natural predators against the pest. ""When the tomato leafminer invades a country, it can cause between 80 and 100 per cent crop losses unless farmers and countries are ready with counter-measures,"" said Rangaswamy Muniappan, an entomologist and director of the integrated pest management innovation laboratory at Virginia Tech in the US. ""The pest can move in multiple ways - the moth itself is tiny and can move only from farm to farm, but commercial transport of tomatoes can take the pest from one part of the country into another, and it probably crosses borders and oceans through tomato exports or nursery seedlings,"" Muniappan said. The NBAIR scientists have spent the past year looking for other insects that might serve as natural enemies against the South American pest. Their studies suggest that two wasps, Tricogramma Presiotum and Trichogramma Achaea , may serve as promising biological predators to curb pinworm populations. Another entomologist, Kesavan Subaharan of the NBAIR, is trying to develop a controlled-release trap based on pheromones - chemicals secreted by female moths of Tuta absoluta that attract the male moths. The traps are intended to lure and capture adult male moths and disrupt the reproductive cycle. ""Pheromone traps are a proven technology when the males are trapped, the females have no one to mate with, they can't lay eggs, the population is suppressed,"" said Subaharan, who leads a team that has developed a technology to keep a pheromone trap active on a farm for up to 45 days. The insect has not been reported from the US yet but the country's government agricultural officials are also concerned. ""Our domestic tomato industry could be severely affected,"" Devaiah Muruvanda, a senior risk manager for the US agriculture department, had said in a media release issued by Virginia Tech last year.

58fefa957be9e0420db2a9df,The ambush on the tongue,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160619/jsp/opinion/story_91990.jsp,2016-06-19,,Telegraph,"Reading about the huge variety of international food now hitting Calcutta makes me imagine the city as a planet which, having placidly circled around its star for billions of years, is suddenly being peppered by rain-waves of asteroids. It's not true, of course: if there was one place in the subcontinent that was a smorgasbord, or rather a khichuri, or perhaps actually a bhelpuri of cosmopolitan foodings, it was this colonial town, soon after its establishment. Besides the massive variety of local food, in its early years the city hosted cuisines from Portugal, France, Britain, Burma, south-east Asia and China, while African, Middle Eastern and Afghan food would also not have been unknown here. Looking back over the last half-century one realizes that the city was in fact provincialized only after the departure of its international citizens. From the mid-1960s to the late 1990s, at the higher price range there was not much available besides the standard, ho-hum five-star fare. Likewise, while the streets retained their great local culinary chutzpah, nothing during those years was particularly exciting or ground-breaking at the lower end of the dining scale either. The city had its cuisine pillars of course, what one could call the Calcutta-Wajid Ali-Lucknow cookery, the most authentic Chinese food in India, and a small cluster of restaurants working the vein of raj Anglo-European cooking. Ringed around Burrabazar and Bhowanipur were also the street foods of north India, Marwar and Gujarat-Bombay, not to mention the South Indian joints near the enclave of Lake Market. Growing up as a doubly local-yokeled kid - south Cal and non-Bong vegetarian - life had in wait a lot of taste surprises for someone like me. I still remember the taste of the first non-Amul cheese, in a sandwich at a French-American couple's house on Pretoria street, some hard cheese, probably Emmental because it had holes, like in the foreign comics, with - I now realize - a thin scrape of Dijon mustard; the first taste of proper French red wine in Delhi as a teenager; the shock of a proper pizza while visiting America; the first taste of Guinness with the tangle of extreme bitter and subtle sweet that could compete with any karela sabzi. Across life, one got to learn that, just as it's possible for many people to be at home anywhere, everybody but almost everybody is a provincial, a local-yokel, during their first years, no matter whether those years are spent in a floating market on the Mekong or a chateau in Mdoc. In this regard, a sudden memory pops up. My mother was a fine cook of Gujarati food and many non-Gujju friends became devotees of the various, classic snack items she'd make. In the mid-1990s, one such friend was working in Dhaka when I travelled to meet her. The loud and repeated request was for me to bring a stack of my mother's much sought after theplas (spiced paratha-type flatbread). I duly took along a box packed with theplas and, since it was Ramazan, a few of these were placed alongside the several other items where the iftar feast was laid out. The thepla fan burst into effusive excitement when she saw the discs loaded with methi leaves and all sorts of spices, and immediately grabbed one. Our host, a sophisticated, upper-class Bangladeshi woman, much travelled and widely exposed to the different foods of the world, also picked up one. As I watched, she took a bite and her head snapped back in shock and revulsion. She quickly put down the offending thing and put distance between herself and the ecstatically mumbling thepla fan. At first I was deeply offended - it was as if my Bangladeshi friend had insulted my mom. But then I thought back at all the electrified rejections and ejections I had made of alien tasting food across my life, not least all sorts of supposedly great Bengali fish, and I calmed down. Like me, my mother, too, couldn't stand any smell of fish, uncooked or cooked. But she would have had equal if not greater revulsion for some of the things I've grown to love, from mutton curry and roast pork to finely sliced carpaccio of raw beef and bresaola. Thinking back, what offended me about my Bangladeshi friend's reaction was that, in my mind, she was after all a desi and not some bland-palate foreigner, and one who wasn't inexperienced in eating spicy subcontinental vegetable preparations, nor desi breads including, I imagine, rotis, luchis and dhakai parathas. Again, another neutralizing memory collides with this one, of when I first went to non-Bombay, proper Maharashtra in my mid-twenties. It was in Pune, one morning, that I asked for a cup of tea at a roadside stall. By now I'd had 'Indian-style tea' in many parts of northern and eastern India; I knew the taste of the thin Bengali chaa in the maatir bhaand, I'd bitten into thick, milky chaay at many Sikh dhabas, I knew well the differently highly sweet and masala loaded chaah in Ahmedabad; I just wasn't prepared for the particular masala they use in Maharashtra (or, at least in Pune) in their roadside tsahaa. Like my future Bangladeshi friend, I almost threw up at the first sip of that stuff and had to really control myself so as not to offend all the slurping Ghaatis around me. It's akin to what a friend, an aficionado of Hindustani classical, said, as he confessed that he couldn't stand Carnatic music, ""Of course you can recognize some of the the same raags as in Hindustani music, the notes are all in the right order, but the spicing is just wrong! I can't bear that!"" I suppose it's about what one is used to, also about what one is expecting to land on one's ear or tongue, and about being unevenly open- and close-minded about different things. For instance, in my rejection of all things piscatory, I remember throwing a fit when I discovered a friend had used (precious) fish sauce in a Thai meal she had lovingly made for my birthday. That was about 20 years ago; now I stock the (readily available) fish sauce in my own cupboard for any visiting culinary artist who wants to use it to cook in my kitchen. Similarly, I've seen other people change their food prejudices, some gradually beginning to like stinky cheese, or the taste of hiing or karela, some having a sudden epiphany about gin, or about the beautiful power of the bhut jolokia chilli. Equally, as time passes, one has witnessed people's tastes (and sometimes world views) shrink, chilli-champions of yore being unable to take even the slightest mirchi-heat, hard-core drinkards of wine rejecting allergy-causing red wine for 'safe' whisky, tomato-phobists actually beginning to use the emperor of fruit-vegetables in their cooking and so on. I think it's great that Calcutta is receiving all these different cuisines, albeit at the moneyed end. I think the ionic exchange between Calcutta the local yokel and world food, and simultaneously between Calcutta the sophisticated food town and the ignorant world, should increase exponentially. In terms of Calcutta as a food-discerning city, I find myself hoping our tastes continue to expand, and not just in some snobbish, money-driven way. It would be great if we were to have different innovative food vans a la so many cities, not just in Europe and America, but all over the globe. It would be extremely desirable (and I know this is a whole different Pandora's box, but it's not unconnected) if we were to avoid the knee-jerk reactions of Bihar (and, previously, Kerala) in following Gujarat into declaring foolish prohibition and decided to really work on changing our drink culture. It would be wonderful to take a leaf out of Bangkok's book and make sure our numerous street food stalls were strictly hygienic and spankingly clean. All of this would (forgive the pun) feed into making Calcutta a different kind of 'food capital' or 'food hub' from what it once used to be. As someone, I forget who exactly, once said, if you change a society's food habits you transform that society itself. This change, if it can be effected, would be a good ambush to face.","reading about the huge variety of international food now hitting calcutta makes me imagine the city as a planet which, having placidly circled around its star for billions of years, is suddenly being peppered by rain-waves of asteroids. it's not true, of course: if there was one place in the subcontinent that was a smorgasbord, or rather a khichuri, or perhaps actually a bhelpuri of cosmopolitan foodings, it was this colonial town, soon after its establishment. besides the massive variety of local food, in its early years the city hosted cuisines from portugal, france, britain, burma, south-east asia and china, while african, middle eastern and afghan food would also not have been unknown here. looking back over the last half-century one realizes that the city was in fact provincialized only after the departure of its international citizens. from the mid-1960s to the late 1990s, at the higher price range there was not much available besides the standard, ho-hum five-star fare. likewise, while the streets retained their great local culinary chutzpah, nothing during those years was particularly exciting or ground-breaking at the lower end of the dining scale either. the city had its cuisine pillars of course, what one could call the calcutta-wajid ali-lucknow cookery, the most authentic chinese food in india, and a small cluster of restaurants working the vein of raj anglo-european cooking. ringed around burrabazar and bhowanipur were also the street foods of north india, marwar and gujarat-bombay, not to mention the south indian joints near the enclave of lake market. growing up as a doubly local-yokeled kid - south cal and non-bong vegetarian - life had in wait a lot of taste surprises for someone like me. i still remember the taste of the first non-amul cheese, in a sandwich at a french-american couple's house on pretoria street, some hard cheese, probably emmental because it had holes, like in the foreign comics, with - i now realize - a thin scrape of dijon mustard;

(File Photo)In a bid to connect with North Indian voters ahead of BMC elections slated next year, ruling BJP has organised a public dinner with a traditional menu at suburban Goregaon on September 2 which will be attended by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. BJP city unit, which has organised the function, said 5,000 invitations have been sent out for the function, to be held in the western suburb.We are elated to announce that our chief minister would be having quality time with the people of North India over Baati-Chokha wherein he would interact with the intellectuals as well as commoners invited from all walks of life, BJP city unit president Ashish Shelar said on Thursday. He said Fadnavis will be first such CM who wanted to connect with commoners over a dinner with their traditional food.While baati consists of wheat and sattu (powdered roasted blackgrams) formed into balls with spices, and then dipped in ghee (clarified butter) chokha is a dip prepared by mashing boiled potatoes, tomatoes and eggplant together with some spices. It is no surprise that the BJP is aggressively trying to woo Uttar Bhartiyas as they form 28 per cent vote share in countrys financial capital. The outreach has another objective with forthcoming Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, due next year.BMC has been ruled by Shiv Sena, which plays its agenda of sons-of-soil vs outsiders, with the BJP as a junior partner for over two decades. On the choice of venue, as Shiv Sena recently held a function to mark its golden jubilee at the same spot, Shelar said, We are organising this programme at same place where one party had recently celebrated its 50 years without connecting with the commoner, but our case it different.

The committee's clearance certifies genetically modified mustard as ""safe for human and animal consumption"". Nitish requested the Prime Minister to intervene in the matter and ensure that attempts towards its commercial release are not taken without prior consultation and the state government's consent. ""I strongly urge you that GM mustard application which has been cleared by a sub-committee to GEAC must be overruled instantaneously,"" he wrote to Modi. ""Further, no decision on GM crops should be taken in haste, as it can harm the interests of the farmers and the people of India at large."" In the missive dispatched on October 6 - a copy of which is with The Telegraph - Nitish has also pointed out that ""interested parties"" were trying to push in an unproven technology and the states must have a decisive say in its use. Narendra Modi ""We strongly feel that as per existing policy, Government of India should consult and seek no objections from the state government before conducting field trials of any GM crop. The states must have a decisive say in the use of the technology and any dubious technology should not be thrust on farmers,"" Nitish wrote. The chief minister's opposition to GM seeds and crops is well known. He had been at the forefront, opposing field trials of transgenic Bt brinjal (brinjal with a gene inserted from bacillus thuringiensis to make it pest-resistant) and genetically modified maize, mustard and other crops. He has documented the Bihar government's opposition to GM crops and expressed dismay that ""the unscientific push for GM mustard"" was continuing despite previous communication in the matter. Nitish said that if transgenic mustard gets final approval it will become the gateway to a host of other GM food crops, including maize, rice, brinjal, wheat and tomato among others. The chief minister's worry stems from the fact that mustard is an important crop for Bihar and its oil is used for cooking, seeds as condiments in dishes, leaves consumed as a winter delicacy and cakes (residue after pressing seeds to extract oil) as animal feed. Its yellow flowers serve as food for honeybees during winter. ""Mustard is an important crop for states like Bihar and we'll not be able to escape the consequences of the technology,"" Nitish said on the use of transgenic mustard. ""When it comes to food crops, the country has to be particularly cautious. Health impact on consumers cannot be ruled out."" So far, the only GM crop granted final approval is Bt Cotton; cultivated in cotton-growing areas of Maharashtra, Gujarat and elsewhere since 2002. Nitish argued that the case of Bt Cotton amply demonstrates that GM is a failed technology, as bollworm, a cotton pest for which it was brought, has developed resistance against the Bt toxin and is wreaking havoc on cotton crops causing heavy losses to thousands of farmers across the country. He also questioned why GM mustard is seeking to promote itself as a hybrid technology when non-GM hybrids are available. ""I had written to the Union minister of environment and forests in January saying that interested parties who failed to win the confidence of farmers (on transgenic crops) are now pushing the technology through public institutions,"" Nitish said. ""There have been conflicting claims on the superiority of GM mustard and there is ample proof provided by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and civil society that the tests were misled to obtain favourable results. This particular GM mustard variety was tested against 40-year old varieties,"" Nitish added. He said GM mustard is similar in yield to latest hybrid varieties of mustard available in public and private sectors. He reiterated that agriculture was a state subject and urged Modi, who has been emphasising on cooperative federalism, to demonstrate by cancelling the nod to GM mustard. GM crops have come under severe opposition from advocacy groups and non-government organisations, who say its risks have not been adequately examined and sufficient testing not possible, as the regulatory authorities and scientific bodies in various countries are too closely tied to private sector industry.

5904e4507be9e04154dfd555,Taste of the Himalayas,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/handle/taste-of-the-himalayas/,2016-02-26,,The Times Of India,"A refreshing route taken by chefs of late, is home-style cooking, frills and fancy-free (read no heavy-duty carved tomato/carrot garnish), and keeping it simple and true to origin. In that context, the promotion of not-so- widely-showcased regional cuisines, like pahari food, as Himachal cuisine is referred to in North India, comes across as a breath of much-needed fresh air in the clutter of other popular cuisines, such as Punjabi (or what passes for it, these days) or Rajasthani cuisine.I was therefore quite enthused about the invite to a Himalayan Pop-Up curated by Miss Shimla Sherry Malhotra,from Marriott Hyderabad which would be hosted at its Indian specialty restaurant Bidri.Yogender Pal, the executive chef at Marriott Hyderabad, is an old guard of the slow and steady cooking techniques of retaining flavours and nutrients, and also hails from the mountain state of Himachal Pradesh. I soon learnt that hobby chef Sherry Malhotra, who also happens to be Miss Simla (2005) , runs a successful catering business in Mumbai, and you would obviously expect something completely out of the ordinary! Enough said, I rest my case, you get the drift.When a couple of us, food bloggers reached Bidri in the afternoon, we were handed out the chef caps and aprons and soon got down to re-creating a recipe Chana Madra, a Himachali recipe, Chickpeas cooked in a light yogurt gravy, along with lotus seeds (makhana) and coconut slices. The recipe uses whisked yogurt, whole garam masala (green cardamom or choti elaichi, cinnamon and cloves) as well as ground elaichi powder, red chilli powder, a pinch of turmeric, jeera powder, salt to taste and a bit of sugar too.Himachali cuisine is light, healthy and flavorful and makes wide use of yogurt, saunf, garam masala, hing, mustard oil, ghee, black lentils, besan, fenugreek and tomatoes, which are grown locally, shares Chef Pal.

I am sitting all toasty and warm in my favorite recliner when the doorbell rings and a friend sashays in, radiating bonhomie and good cheer. I have just come from Surat and look what I have for you, she exults. Diamonds? I breathe hopefully. No silly, she giggles, waving a bejeweled hand towards a box she is carrying. Its ponkh!Ponkh? I squeak.Spoiler alert: for those of you who are hardcore carnivores, there is no meat in this story!What she has got back from her recent soujourn to Surat is a Gujarati delicacy called ponkh which is the local name given to tender jowar seeds or white millets. During a brief period in the winter months, the jowar grain is juicy and very tender and the seeds are just right to be harvested and eaten roasted. It is generally picked from fields and cooked there and then, with parties thrown to celebrate this young edible seed.My friends box reveals a bunch of packets neatly packed together: the green jowar seeds, three types of sev (fried gram flour noodles) and tiny sugar granules also known as sakkar-danna. The three sevs spread out in front of me are variously colored: a yellow one which is mildly spicy, a tomato-flavored red one, and the brown one which is hot and spicy and enticingly called limbu-mari (lime and pepper). The three flavors of the sev and their sharpness offset the slightly bland and sweetish taste of the ponkh. And I guess the sakkar-danas are provided to counteract the smoke-in -the-ears spiciness of the limbu-mari. Ponkh is sometimes eaten raw and sometimes slightly roasted and Gujaratis often wash it down with glasses of chhaas or lassi. My friend informs me that die-hard lovers of this delicacy even attend ponkh picnics in Surat.In Maharashtra, ponkh is known as hurda. As a child, I remember my mother talking about the hurda parties she used to attend on her visits to her hometown of Amalner, Maharashtra. During the season, the local farmers would throw a party in the middle of the fields where the young tender jowar was being roasted and eaten directly when it was still hot and tender. To accompany the hurda, the farmers wives would provide jaggery (gud), shengdana-lassun chutney (groundnut-garlic chutney), dry khobra chutney (dry coconut chutney), wangya chi bhaji (a brinjal preparation)and taak (butter milk).So now I am sitting with this big fat packet of ponkh and after diligently mixing the three sevs and a bit of the sugar granules with the green seeds, I carefully plate it on a salad dish and serve it to the family. Unfortunately, it does not set anyone on fire. The husband grimaces, the foodie wrinkles his nose and I stoically plod through the helping I have served myself. The next day, I decide to spice up the ponkh by serving it as a bhel. I add finely chopped onions, tomatoes, green chillies, coriander leaves, rock salt, a dash of chaat masala, and a few drops of lemon juice. On top, I add the rainbow colored sev, and serve it in the evening as an appetizer before dinner. The foodie son looks at it and exclaims, That thing again!My cook, the Garwahli genius, comes in from the kitchen to see what the fuss is all about. He takes a look at the ponkh offering, tastes it and then saunters off to the kitchen with something suspiciously sounding like Not on my table wafting on the breeze. With sarson ka saag and makke di roti on the menu, the poor ponkh is not getting its day under the sun in our house.Desperate to finish the huge mound of ponkh sitting forlornly in my kitchen, I call a few Gujarati friends and ask if they would want ponkh. Chokkas! Tarat mukaljo! (Of course, send at once) is the ardent response. And now, just as I am sitting back with a contented sigh that the ponkh has finally gone to places where it is being appreciated, my friend calls and asks how I liked the ponkh. Loved it, I squawk and cross my fingers for lying. Great, she chirps happily.

Nashik district accounts for over 40 per cent of the total tomatoes produced in Maharashtra.Kehav Kakad, a farmer from Girnare in Nashik district, received a newly minted Rs 2,000 note on Friday for the 20 quintal of tomatoes he had gone to the Girnare market with. In December last year, Kakad had got Rs 30,400 for the same quantity in the same market.Last year, I received Rs 30,400. Also, the payment was done in notes that I could spend. This year, not only has the price dipped, I am being paid in currency that not many people are willing to take, says Kakad.He is one of the many farmers in Nashik district who have been hit hard by the slump in tomato prices. The overproduction of tomatoes in the country, coupled with the demonetisation effect, has meant that at places such as Girnare, farmers have been forced to sell their produce for as less as Re 1 per kg. The average price for tomatoes in Nashik district for this entire month was a measly Rs 2.76 per kg. Last year during the same period, it was close to Rs 15.5 per kg.Watch What Else is Making NewsNashik district accounts for over 40 per cent of the total tomatoes produced in Maharashtra. Over the past three years, tomato production has seen a major surge across the country, including in Maharashtra. In 2014, APMCs across Maharashtra saw a total of 3.90 lakh tonne tomatoes coming into the market, with Nashik accounting for over 30 per cent at 1.24 lakh tonne. The production has, however, spiked to nearly double at 8.59 lakh tonne this year, with Nashik accounting for 3.82 lakh tonnes.While the increased production has played a role in bringing prices down, farmers say demonetisation is to blame too. Before the move, farmers were on an average getting Rs 5.2 per kg for tomatoes. Post November 8, when the decision was announced, the prices in Nashik dipped to Rs 2.76 per kg.This is the last stage of the tomato crop. It cant survive in winter and farmers are desperate to dispose of their produce. The traders know this and are squeezing farmers, citing the effects of demonetisation. They say you either sell at this price or go home with your produce, says Bhausaheb Shinde, a farmer from Palse in Nashik.Traders claim the oversupply of the crop is deciding the price.There is no manipulation by traders. There is an oversupply in the market. The total produce that came in this month is almost double of what was seen during the same period last year. The overproduction across the country has caused the price drop, says a trader from Girnare, not wishing to be named.However, despite the low prices farmers are being offered, there has not been much fall in retail prices of tomatoes, which continue to be sold at Rs 10-15 per kg across the state.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now","nashik district accounts for over 40 per cent of the total tomatoes produced in maharashtra. nashik district accounts for over 40 per cent of the total tomatoes produced in maharashtra.kehav kakad, a farmer from girnare in nashik district, received a newly minted rs 2,000 note on friday for the 20 quintal of tomatoes he had gone to the girnare market with. in december last year, kakad had got rs 30,400 for the same quantity in the same market.last year, i received rs 30,400. also, the payment was done in notes that i could spend. this year, not only has the price dipped, i am being paid in currency that not many people are willing to take, says kakad.he is one of the many farmers in nashik district who have been hit hard by the slump in tomato prices. the overproduction of tomatoes in the country, coupled with the demonetisation effect, has meant that at places such as girnare, farmers have been forced to sell their produce for as less as re 1 per kg. the average price for tomatoes in nashik district for this entire month was a measly rs 2.76 per kg. last year during the same period, it was close to rs 15.5 per kg.watch what else is making newsnashik district accounts for over 40 per cent of the total tomatoes produced in maharashtra. over the past three years, tomato production has seen a major surge across the country, including in maharashtra. in 2014, apmcs across maharashtra saw a total of 3.90 lakh tonne tomatoes coming into the market, with nashik accounting for over 30 per cent at 1.24 lakh tonne. the production has, however, spiked to nearly double at 8.59 lakh tonne this year, with nashik accounting for 3.82 lakh tonnes.while the increased production has played a role in bringing prices down, farmers say demonetisation is to blame too. before the move, farmers were on an average getting rs 5.2 per kg for tomatoes. post november 8, when the decision was announced, the prices in nashik dipped to rs 2.76 per kg.this is the last stage of the tomato crop. it cant survive in winter and farmers are desperate to dispose of their produce. the traders know this and are squeezing farmers, citing the effects of demonetisation. they say you either sell at this price or go home with your produce, says bhausaheb shinde, a farmer from palse in nashik.traders claim the oversupply of the crop is deciding the price.there is no manipulation by traders. there is an oversupply in the market. the total produce that came in this month is almost double of what was seen during the same period last year. the overproduction across the country has caused the price drop, says a trader from girnare, not wishing to be named.however, despite the low prices farmers are being offered, there has not been much fall in retail prices of tomatoes, which continue to be sold at rs 10-15 per kg across the state.for all the latest india news, download indian express app now"
5909ffc67be9e033b96ea08f,When cash vanishes: A double-whammy,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/demonetisation-currency-ban-pune-farmers-wholesale-market-4379579/,2016-11-17,,Indian Express,"The market yard of the wholesale agricultural produce mandi at Pune wears a deserted look post-demonetisation. (Express Photo: Pavan Khengre) The market yard of the wholesale agricultural produce mandi at Pune wears a deserted look post-demonetisation. (Express Photo: Pavan Khengre)The last one week and more has brought nothing but bad news for Vasant Pimpale. This farmer from Pargaon Tarfe Ale, a village in Pune districts Junnar taluka, has already lost 11 tonnes of green chilli grown on eight out of his 15-acres holding. The loss hasnt been courtesy drought, flood or hail, but because of a disaster totally man-made.Till early this month, I used to dispatch roughly two tonnes of vegetables (including cabbage, cauliflower and brinjal) every day to the Vashi wholesale market in Navi Mumbai. But after November 8, I am unable to send even 800 kg, as the traders have told me that there is no demand, says Pimpale, who has had to endure the loss of his chilli crop, which has turned from green to red, simply for lack of buyers. And hes clear what has been behind his tale of misfortune: the Narendra Modi governments decision to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination currency notes.Watch What Else is Making NewsSince November 8, the day demonetisation happened, prices of green chilli at Vashi have fallen from around Rs 14 to Rs 3 per kg, while similarly dropping from Rs 13 to Rs 4 for cauliflower and from Rs 26 to Rs 12 for brinjal. The market for our produce has all but collapsed, complains Pimpale, who is among the many farmers in rural Maharashtra to have been impacted by the virtual disappearance of cash from the system.The bulk of them have operational bank accounts, but sell their entire produce for cash to traders who are now strapped for currency. With the mandis in Nashik, Lasalgaon, Manchar, Manmad and other produce market towns officially closed and even the terminal market at Vashi registering steep drop in trading volumes, farmers  particularly those growing perishables like vegetables and flowers that cannot remain in or outside fields too long after maturity  are the hardest hit.Shriram Gadve, a farmer from Arvi near Narayangaon and also president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India, estimates that Junnar  the taluka where his village, too, falls  alone has some 40,000 acres under vegetable cultivation. 95 per cent of growers in this belt sell to the Vashi terminal market that is about 160 km away, while the rest dispose of their produce in nearby mandis such as Narayangaon and Manchar. The ones selling at Vashi do it through hundekaris.The hundekaris are essentially local farmers, acting as conduits between growers, organised into groups, and traders sitting at Vashi. They aggregate the growers produce and arrange for its transport against a one per cent commission on the final price. While the traders in Vashi issue pattis (purchase slips) in the name of individual farmers, the entire payment after deducting transport cost and labour charges is made to the hundekaris. The hundekari may receive the payment either in cash or even through bank account transfer. But he pays the farmers belonging to his group entirely in cash.The pattis are sent to farmers a day after sale takes place, while payments happen on a weekly basis. We pay in cash after withdrawing the money from our own account. The farmers selling directly in local markets, too, transact wholly in cash, explains Sachin Gadve, a five-acre farmer from Arvi who is also a hundekari for 60 growers. Since demonetisation, the traders in Vashi have told us to send less quantities, as they are finding to it difficult to offload the produce further to retailers selling to the final consumer, he adds.Its very simple. The household end-buyer has no cash to purchase from the feriwala (hawker/retailer), who, in turn, sources from us. Everybody down the chain to the farmer has naturally been affected, points out Rajendra Shelke, president of the Onion Potato Commission Agents and Traders Union at the Vashi market, which, on an average day, receives 700-800 truckloads of vegetables and 100-115 of onions and potatoes. On Wednesday, these numbers were down to 300 and 40 trucks, respectively. Our whole business is done in cash. Today, we are neither able to sell the produce nor in a position to pay farmers, he notes.The situation is no different in other markets. Daily vegetable arrivals at Punes agriculture produce market committee mandi, which used to be around 200 truckloads, has dropped to 80. In most suburban markets, there has been no trading at all for the last one week. Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaon market committee, has written a letter to the Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, seeking permission for transactions in mandis using the now-withdrawn Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. 90 per cent of the business was, in any case, being done in these so-called high-value notes. If they have permitted petrol pumps to accept these, why cannot the same be allowed for agricultural produce in regulated markets such as ours? he asks.What makes matters worse is that no immediate end to the troubles seems to be in sight, at least for farmers. Hardly a week before demonetisation, Abhay Gadve, a five-acre farmer also from Arvi, had sent a two-tonne consignment of vegetables to Vashi and realised a net value of Rs 25,000 lakh after all the deductions. In my latest patti, all that I got was Rs10,000 for the same quantity. The traders have sent out signals that there could be further reductions, unless cash returns to the system. If I sell at the rate they are quoting, even recovering input costs would be impossible. Theres a lot of cauliflower, cabbage, green chilli, onion, brinjal and coriander at this moment in the Junnar vegetable belt that is ready to be harvested. All this will be lost because of demonetisation. And we are stuck, since bank transfer is also not possible, avers Gadve.But its not just collapse of demand and prices. The cash crunch on account of demonetisation has also affected farmers ahead of plantings for the rabi season. We normally start operations from the first week of November, during which time seeds, fertilisers and other inputs are procured. Since there is no cash, sowing of chana (chickpea), wheat and garlic is likely to be delayed by more than a fortnight. At the current rate, we may not even have plantings at all, fears Deepak Bhise, president of the Junnar Taluka Tomato Growers Association.Pimpale, the farmer from Pargaon Tarfe Ale village who also manages a farm input shop at Narayangaon, informs that he does daily business of Rs 2-3 lakh during this otherwise busy season. Currently, I am hardly doing Rs 25,000-30,000. Farmers dont have the cash, they are not used to paying through swipe cards or cheques, and I am in no position to accept the withdrawn currency notes. If cash isnt injected into the system, we really dont know what to do, he sums up the situation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now","the market yard of the wholesale agricultural produce mandi at pune wears a deserted look post-demonetisation.

he asks.what makes matters worse is that no immediate end to the troubles seems to be in sight, at least for farmers. hardly a week before demonetisation, abhay gadve, a five-acre farmer also from arvi, had sent a two-tonne consignment of vegetables to vashi and realised a net value of rs 25,000 lakh after all the deductions. in my latest patti, all that i got was rs10,000 for the same quantity. the traders have sent out signals that there could be further reductions, unless cash returns to the system. if i sell at the rate they are quoting, even recovering input costs would be impossible. theres a lot of cauliflower, cabbage, green chilli, onion, brinjal and coriander at this moment in the junnar vegetable belt that is ready to be harvested. all this will be lost because of demonetisation. and we are stuck, since bank transfer is also not possible, avers gadve.but its not just collapse of demand and prices. the cash crunch on account of demonetisation has also affected farmers ahead of plantings for the rabi season. we normally start operations from the first week of november, during which time seeds, fertilisers and other inputs are procured. since there is no cash, sowing of chana (chickpea), wheat and garlic is likely to be delayed by more than a fortnight. at the current rate, we may not even have plantings at all, fears deepak bhise, president of the junnar taluka tomato growers association.pimpale, the farmer from pargaon tarfe ale village who also manages a farm input shop at narayangaon, informs that he does daily business of rs 2-3 lakh during this otherwise busy season. currently, i am hardly doing rs 25,000-30,000. farmers dont have the cash, they are not used to paying through swipe cards or cheques, and i am in no position to accept the withdrawn currency notes. if cash isnt injected into the system, we really dont know what to do, he sums up the situation.for all the latest india news, download indian express app now"

(Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje) Crates carrying tomatoes at the Nashik agriculture produce market committee. (Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje)Suryabhan Kusare hasnt come to terms with the method of payments at the Pimpalgaon Baswant APMC (agriculture produce market committee) yard thats barely a fortnight old. Earlier, we were getting hard cash. Now, the traders and commission agents pay us by cheque. The new system, were told, would ensure that buying will go on and our payments are on time. But effectively, it means standing for hours in front of banks, first to deposit these cheques and then withdraw whatever little we are allowed to, says this farmer from Sawargaon village in Niphad taluka of Maharashtras Nashik district.Soon after the Centres November 8 announcement, demonetising all existing Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination currency notes, traders in all of Nashiks 17 wholesale produce mandis ceased operations, citing shortage of cash to pay farmers. On November 20, the district collector convened a meeting of stakeholders, wherein it was decided that farmers would henceforth be paid either by cheque or through electronic bank transfer. The markets have since opened  with most traders opting for payment through cheques.Watch What Else is Making NewsKusare, who had harvested around 100 quintals of late-kharif season onions from his 2.5 acres holding, isnt happy at all with the new arrangement. Only last week, he sold 25 quintals at the Pimpalgaon Baswant market, fetching him Rs 7,500 at Rs 300 per quintal. The trader wrote out a cheque for this amount drawn on ICICI Bank, which Kusare then took to deposit in his account at the Nashik District Central Cooperative Banks Sawargaon branch. Depositing the cheque took me four hours. The bank people told me it would be cleared only in 4-5 days. After five days, I stood in the queue again and, at the end of it, got just a Rs 2,000 note, complains Kusare.Farmer Pandit Gaikar with his cauliflower produce at the Nashik APMC. (Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje) Farmer Pandit Gaikar with his cauliflower produce at the Nashik APMC. (Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje)Pramod Kusare, a fellow-farmer from the same village, has a similar story to narrate. About eight days back, he took 50 crates of tomatoes (each of 20 kg) to Pimpalgaon Baswant and got a cheque of Rs 4,000 for it: I stood for three hours to deposit the cheque and queued up for another two hours after four days to collect a single Rs 2,000 note. I was informed that the banks cash position did not permit me to get more.For farmers like the Kusare, November-December happens to also be the peak planting time for rabi season crops  mainly onions, tomatoes, and wheat. For them, the move from instant cash to receiving cheque payments has translated into productive time in the fields getting diverted to standing for hours in serpentine bank queues.Just as Lasalgaon is for onions, Pimpalgaon Baswant  also in Nashik district  is known as the market that sets the price for tomatoes in the country. With an annual turnover exceeding Rs 1,000 crore, this APMC last year recorded total produce arrivals of over 76 lakh quintals, mostly tomatoes, onions and pomegranate. During the peak season, which is from November through the first week of December, daily tomato arrivals are in the range of 20,000-30,000 crates. Even now, 15,000-20,000 crates are arriving every day, with nearly 100 per cent payments to farmers being done though cheques issued by traders either on the same or following day.Somnath Nimse, one of the 557 traders/commission agents at the Pimpalgaon Baswant APMC, admits that clearing of cheques takes 5-6 days. We were willing to adopt electronic bank transfers, but the internet connectivity here isnt good to enable that, he notes. Tomato prices have crashed post-demonetisation; the average quoted rate, last Friday, at Nashiks primary produce markets was as low as Rs 20 per crate or Rs 1/kg. Its not just farmers. We ourselves are struggling to sell in other (terminal) markets, as the traders there are finding it difficult to arrange funds for making purchases, claims Nimse, who, in the past, has also exported tomatoes to Bangladesh. That trade has completely stopped after November 8. During the peak season, I myself make tomato purchases of Rs 25-30 lakh in cash per day. As against this, the government has specified a weekly cash withdrawal limit of Rs 50,000 for traders, which is a cruel joke, he adds.Traders at Lasalgaon, a market that is synonymous with onions and deals in some 40 lakh quintals of the bulb annually, have also moved almost entirely to cheque payments post-demonetisation. Right now, about 97 per cent of transactions are being done through cheques. We are quite happy having done away with cash payments. Our attempt would be next to go in for direct bank transfer, states Nitin Jain, a commission agent-cum-exporter based in this APMC that is 30 km from Pimpalgaon Baswant.Jagdish Apsunde, a trader and director at the APMC in Nashik  not far from the main city  has already taken the step of electronically transferring money into the accounts of farmers supplying to him. Ive got them to submit their bank account details along with a cancelled cheque to enable me to remit payments directly. This way, farmers are ensured of getting their money the very next day, saving them at least the trouble of having to deposit cheques, observes Apsunde, whose daily peak business in tomatoes and onions runs to over Rs 10 lakh.The Nashik APMC, which handles around 84 lakh quintals of produce annually, was closed for three working days after the demonetisation announcement. Since the meeting with the district collector, the bulk of the 1,300-odd traders here have adopted non-cash means to pay farmers. We are also in the process of getting a public sector bank to open a branch within our mandi premises, which should help farmers, informs KB Shevale, assistant secretary of the APMC.Arun Govindrao Wagh, chairman of the smaller APMC at Sinnar, isnt as enthusiastic about produce trading going cashless. Although we have moved to cheque payments, it doesnt help farmers, as they need cash for purchase of farm inputs and labour payments. How can one expect them to embrace debit or credit cards, leave alone internet banking? he points out.Farmers, on their part, seem resigned to accepting payments now largely through cheque. Pandit Gaikar recently sold 25 crates of cauliflower at the Nashik APMC, for which he received Rs 1,000. The nearest bank is 15 km away from my village. I couldnt possibly have gone all that distance to deposit a cheque for such a paltry amount, and further await payment. My trader was fortunately kind enough to agree and pay me Rs 1,000 in cash, remarks this farmer from Gangavhare near Nashik.Gaikar has harvested just a quarter of his cauliflower crop on one acre and has another two acres of brinjal almost ready to be picked and sold. I dont know what price I am going to get in todays cashless market. Even I get a price, will I be able to lay my hands on cash from the sale? Without cash, how am I going to fill diesel in my tractor and make labour payments for my next crop, within the little planting time available now? asks Gaikar.

Thank you all, lets do business, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin said. (source: PTI) Our two nations have changed the world before; it is time to do it again, together. Thank you all, lets do business, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin said. (source: PTI)Stressing that cyber warfare is a strategic challenge, the visiting Israeli President Reuven Rivlin on Thursday said that his country and its defence industry were ready and committed to strengthening its cooperation with India to make a safer world.Introducing the heads of Israels defence industry, Rivlin said in a speech on Thursday, We did not seek to become experts in the field of defence, but through the struggle for our independence and our liberty, we learned how important it is to be able to defend ourselves, to fight our enemies, to fight terrorism. Today the battlefield is changing. Cyber warfare is no longer science fiction, it is a strategic challenge. In all these areas, Israel, and Israeli industry is ready and committed to strengthening this cooperation to make a safer world. Of course we are very grateful to our Indian partners for the way they work together with us in order to ensure a safe and secure world.He added, There is positive and growing cooperation between our countries in many areas of defence and security. We also face a common challenge in fighting terrorism and radicalism. I am here today to affirm our commitment to the fight against global terrorism. We are here today to carry the great potential of this partnership into reality.Rivlin is in India for an eight-day visit. After holding talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this week, he visited Agra and is scheduled to travel to Karnal, Chandigarh and Mumbai.Regarding cooperation across diverse sectors, he said, Israel wants to play a part in the Four-Colours Revolution that Prime Minister Modi has set as Indias national goal, that brings together the colours of the Indian flag: saffron for solar power, green for agriculture, white for dairy produce and blue for water. In all these issues, Israel  little Israel  is a giant of knowledge and experience, as we have already had to overcome our own challenges. Our advanced solar power systems, irrigation systems, water treatment projects and the average milk production per cow are just a few examples.Todays innovations are almost unimaginable  and we now have companies working to make water out of air. We want to gather all these technologies, all the power of our Israeli innovations, as our motivation today: To make in India!! To make with India!! To be your partners!He said the two sides were cooperating to attain food security. We already have Israeli and Indian experts working together with local farmers to improve Indian produce and the lives of local families. We are very proud of all they are doing. Tomorrow, I will visit Karnal where Indians and Israelis are developing new kinds of cherry tomatoes (which is an Israeli invention). They are already making in India a future together.Our two nations have changed the world before; it is time to do it again, together.

(source: pti)stressing that cyber warfare is a strategic challenge, the visiting israeli president reuven rivlin on thursday said that his country and its defence industry were ready and committed to strengthening its cooperation with india to make a safer world.introducing the heads of israels defence industry, rivlin said in a speech on thursday, we did not seek to become experts in the field of defence, but through the struggle for our independence and our liberty, we learned how important it is to be able to defend ourselves, to fight our enemies, to fight terrorism. today the battlefield is changing. cyber warfare is no longer science fiction, it is a strategic challenge. in all these areas, israel, and israeli industry is ready and committed to strengthening this cooperation to make a safer world. of course we are very grateful to our indian partners for the way they work together with us in order to ensure a safe and secure world.he added, there is positive and growing cooperation between our countries in many areas of defence and security. we also face a common challenge in fighting terrorism and radicalism. i am here today to affirm our commitment to the fight against global terrorism. we are here today to carry the great potential of this partnership into reality.rivlin is in india for an eight-day visit. after holding talks with prime minister narendra modi earlier this week, he visited agra and is scheduled to travel to karnal, chandigarh and mumbai.regarding cooperation across diverse sectors, he said, israel wants to play a part in the four-colours revolution that prime minister modi has set as indias national goal, that brings together the colours of the indian flag: saffron for solar power, green for agriculture, white for dairy produce and blue for water. in all these issues, israel  little israel  is a giant of knowledge and experience, as we have already had to overcome our own challenges. our advanced solar power systems, irrigation systems, water treatment projects and the average milk production per cow are just a few examples.todays innovations are almost unimaginable  and we now have companies working to make water out of air. we want to gather all these technologies, all the power of our israeli innovations, as our motivation today: to make in india!! to make with india!! to be your partners!he said the two sides were cooperating to attain food security. we already have israeli and indian experts working together with local farmers to improve indian produce and the lives of local families. we are very proud of all they are doing. tomorrow, i will visit karnal where indians and israelis are developing new kinds of cherry tomatoes (which is an israeli invention). they are already making in india a future together.our two nations have changed the world before; it is time to do it again, together. thank you all, lets do business, he said to a standing ovation.for all the latest world news, download indian express app now"
590a30a77be9e033b96ebace,Halting desertification,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/581090/halting-desertification.html,2016-11-14,,Deccan Herald,"Sriroop Chaudhuri and Mimi Roy, Nov 15, 2016 23:16 ISTFOOD, CLIMATE, MIGRATION : About 96.4 million hectares land area (29.3% of total landmass) of India is currently under land degradation/desertificatioIn the last couple of decades, land degr-adation/desertification has grown into an appalling menace to sustainable human development, affecting billions around the world including India, leaving the authorities reeling over dire resource depletion/inadequacy. A major reason for it has been a lack of consensus over a precise definition of desertification.As per the United Nations Convention for Combating Desertification (UNCCD), desertification is virtually any form of land degradation in the arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas, resulting from a combination of climatic variations and unplanned human expansion. Desertification, by newer definitions, is no more just about sand dunes and oasis. Today it means the collective damage caused to the worlds dryland ecosystems.In India, combating land degradation/ desertification has emerged as a top environmental priority to the authorities concerned. India is signatory to the UNCCD and intends to achieve land degradation neutral status by 2030. On June 17, 2016, on the occasion of World Day to Combat Desertification, the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC), and Arid Zone Forest Research Institute (AFRI), jointly released desertification maps of the country. These maps, compiled by the Space Application Centre, Isro along with 19 partner instit-utes, for the 2003-05 and 2011-13 periods, have brought up some disturbing facts.It appears that about 96.4 million hectares (Mha) land area (29.3% of total landmass) of the country is currently under land degradation/desertification, as compared to about 94.5 Mha (28.7%) during 2003-05. By far, Rajasthan appears to be the hot-seat of degradation/ desertification in the country followed by Maharashtra, Gujarat, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana. Cumulatively, these nine states account for about 23% of the total land area under degradation/desertification in India.But what bakes the cake really is the state-wise land area under degradation/ desertification. In Jharkhand (68.9%), Rajasthan (62.9%), Delhi (60.6%), Gujarat (52.2%) and Goa (52.1%), over half the land area is under intense threat of land degradation/desertification. To add further to the aggravation, in each on these states/UTs, land degradation/desertification has increased between 2003-05 and 2011-13 period with the worst scenario apparent in Delhi, registering about 11% increase.Desertification/degradation is on steep gradients in the Northeast as well. In Tri-pura, land degradation/desertification increased by about 10.4% between 2003-05 and 2011-13, in Nagaland by 8.7% and Mizoram 4.3%. Overall, in 25 states/UTs, desertification appears to be on the rise.But why the heck we care for desertification of the drylands? Here is what the drylands do: they constitute about 34% of worlds total landmass and are major source of food, especially for the poor. One in three crops cultivated today, including oats, barley, tomatoes, potatoes, cabbage and saffron, originated from drylands. About half the worlds livestock is concentrated in the drylands.Recent UNCCD reports suggest that about 52% of worlds agricultural land area is moderate to severely degraded. About 12 Mha of productive land are turning barren annually resulting from desertification/drought, toppling cha-nces of about 20 mt of food grains which acutely exacerbates global food crises.As added vice, desertified areas are noted for their long-range adversities on climate. For example, reduction in vegetation (frequently associated with desertification) cover elevates atmospheric aerosol/dust levels which affect cloud formation and rainfall patterns, carbon cycle, and biodiversity.Visibility crises in Beijing, a well-known menace these days, is believed to have been caused by springtime dust storms originating in the Gobi Desert. Yellow Dust from China costs the Korean and Japanese economy a huge revenue each year. It is also taken for US air quality deterioration in recent times. In China itself, desertification, leading to recurrent droughts and massive crop-losses, takes a nice bite of the countrys annual GDP. Studies find that desertification can hugely magnify global warming in days ahead.But putting aside the tangible issues regarding food/water shortage, and climate, there are others that do not meet naked eye. One such is forced migration. Desertification is destabilising large communities globally, turning them into migrants and homeless refugees.Environmental migrationAn estimated mob of 60 million will migrate from desertified areas in sub-Saharan Africa to North Africa and/or Europe by 2020. By 2050, about 200 million people will turn up as perman-ently displaced environmental migrants. Governmental reports suggest that such displaced mob and forced migrants often take to radicalisation and extremism, inciting brutal resource-driven conflicts.Environmental migration is largely triggering political instability, terrorist disturbances, and food/water riots across desertified areas, ultimately spilling over to neighbouring lands. So what can we do to halt desertification? Or shall we do anything at all? Monitoring for causes of desertification should be central any action plan. Aberrant climatic shifts is of course the major impaling factor.But other than climate, unleashed human expansion contributes a great deal to desertification:a) Land cover change (due to urban sprawl): deforestation/logging beyond permissible limits; forest fires/encroachment into forest lands; conversion of native croplandsb) Land management protocol: inadequate soil conservation measures (soil erosion); improper crop rotation /shift in cultivation patterns; improper irrigation schemes (water-logging/leaching); indiscriminate use of agro-chemicals (soil salinisation)c) Overexploitation of natural resources (overpopulation/demand): overgrazing; unplanned groundwater extraction; inequitable sharingd) Lack of resources (tools/funds/ trained professionals) to: support innovative dryland agriculture; reclaim water-logged and/or saline soilsThese days, climate change also is a ramified effect of human expansion (urbanisation/carbon emission/freshwater abstraction) only. A disturbing fact about desertification is, it is largely irreversible. So, may be its time we seriously gave in to the UNs recent plea stop deserting the deserts. Other than building up holistic awareness among the common people, a major push should be to establish transnational partnerships to monitor, assess, re-assess and implement stringent actions plans.(The writers are assistant professors and assistant directors, Centre for Environment, O P Jindal Global University, Sonipat, Haryana)","sriroop chaudhuri and mimi roy, nov 15, 2016 23:16 istfood, climate, migration : about 96.4 million hectares land area (29.3% of total landmass) of india is currently under land degradation/desertificatioin the last couple of decades, land degr-adation/desertification has grown into an appalling menace to sustainable human development, affecting billions around the world including india, leaving the authorities reeling over dire resource depletion/inadequacy. a major reason for it has been a lack of consensus over a precise definition of desertification.as per the united nations convention for combating desertification (unccd), desertification is virtually any form of land degradation in the arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas, resulting from a combination of climatic variations and unplanned human expansion. desertification, by newer definitions, is no more just about sand dunes and oasis. today it means the collective damage caused to the worlds dryland ecosystems.in india, combating land degradation/ desertification has emerged as a top environmental priority to the authorities concerned. india is signatory to the unccd and intends to achieve land degradation neutral status by 2030. on june 17, 2016, on the occasion of world day to combat desertification, the ministry of environment, forest & climate change (moef&cc), and arid zone forest research institute (afri), jointly released desertification maps of the country. these maps, compiled by the space application centre, isro along with 19 partner instit-utes, for the 2003-05 and 2011-13 periods, have brought up some disturbing facts.it appears that about 96.4 million hectares (mha) land area (29.3% of total landmass) of the country is currently under land degradation/desertification, as compared to about 94.5 mha (28.7%) during 2003-05. by far, rajasthan appears to be the hot-seat of degradation/ desertification in the country followed by maharashtra, gujarat, jammu & kashmir, karnataka, jharkhand, odisha, madhya pradesh and telangana. cumulatively, these nine states account for about 23% of the total land area under degradation/desertification in india.but what bakes the cake really is the state-wise land area under degradation/ desertification. in jharkhand (68.9%), rajasthan (62.9%), delhi (60.6%), gujarat (52.2%) and goa (52.1%), over half the land area is under intense threat of land degradation/desertification. to add further to the aggravation, in each on these states/uts, land degradation/desertification has increased between 2003-05 and 2011-13 period with the worst scenario apparent in delhi, registering about 11% increase.desertification/degradation is on steep gradients in the northeast as well. in tri-pura, land degradation/desertification increased by about 10.4% between 2003-05 and 2011-13, in nagaland by 8.7% and mizoram 4.3%. overall, in 25 states/uts, desertification appears to be on the rise.but why the heck we care for desertification of the drylands?

(Photo: Reuters ) The Mongolian wrestling coaches, with honey-comb guts and teddy bear chests, stripped to their briefs to protest the referees decision. It was surprising, shocking, heartbreaking and amusing  an undefineable mixed emotion that visited most minds throughout the year. (Photo: Reuters )You can never please the fans: Gary Linekar keeps his word, hosts Match of the Day in undies after his old club Leicester Citys title win. Trolls say, they were shortchanged. #BoxersArentUndies trends.Rainbow now has black too: Finally apartheid ends. Temba Bavuma becomes first black African specialist batsman. Its taken long for South Africas batting line-up, crickets pampered and elitish top order, to get a rainbow hue.Scratch the surface: We do live in the post-truth era. India gets excited about Pranav Dhanawades 1,009 from 327 balls. The rider that mostly went unread: 30 yard boundary, 10-year-old pacers, 25 chances.Mid-career crisis: And you thought Manish Pandey had made it. In January 2016, he scores 104 in 81 balls as India chase down 330 at SCG. Soon it will be January 2017. Pandey still gets chance when stars rest.Sporting rebirth: If you fail as Raju Sharma in India, you can succeed as Raju Rijal in Nepal. Mystery of how within a span of 10 years, an under-15 Mumbai junior player emerged as a under-19 Nepal captain.Negi demonetised: Never trust IPL valuations. How Pawan Negis Rs 8.5 crore cookie crumbled? Mostly on bench during the IPL season, not in Delhis Ranji probables and, now in December, released by Delhi Daredevils.Role reversal: The Ferris wheel went around a circle earlier this year, as Australian journalist Samuel Ferris tried nudging India ODI skipper MS Dhoni on the touchy retirement question. Dhoni called the scribe to sit next to him and asked Do you think I can survive till the 2019 World Cup? You should, yes, sure, the scribe was forced to concede. What goes up, and all that.Defeat to die for: If you thought bad defeats dont hurt coaches, think again. It even turns some towards potential suicide. Makhaya Ntini revealed to have looked for a tomato tree to hang himself after Zimbabwes umpteenth collapse with the bat against India.Final frontier conquered: You dont need the right tech for India to warm up to DRS. You need a captain and coach with the right take on the Decision Review System (DRS) which BCCI snubbed for eight seasons. Fortune favoured the brave as Virat Kohli-Anil Kumbles India won 4-0.Trouble at the top: Openers were a happy headache for Virat Kohli at the start of this year with many batsmen in form. It turned into an actual headache as they contrived to get injured by the end of the 2016. It got so bad that Kohli was forced to open with Parthiv Patel in Mohali while the selectors plucked out Gautam Gambhir from the cold. In all, India used five openers, and six different combinations in just 11 Tests. Not an open and shut case still.No homely feeling: India went into the Mumbai Test against England for the first time without a single player who could call Wankhede home; the first such instance since 1933, when Bombay Gymkhana hosted Indias first-ever Test. No wonder you didnt hear a commentator say he knows it like the back of his hand.More added to the list: Throughout his career, Kiran More was made to regret the dropped catch of Graham Gooch at Lords in 1990. Reprieved on 36, he went on to make 333. Alastair Cook can nurse a regret of his own now: he spilled a difficult one of Karun Nair on 34, and the Indian struck a triple. He has company in Adil Rashid who twice dropped Virat Kohli, who went on to make hundreds of match-changing proportions.Redemption for the royal: Once a figure of ridicule, Ravindra Jadeja silenced detractors in Tests, no less. Not only as a left-arm spinner spinning out England on a blameless pitch in Chennai, but also as a reliable lower-order batsman who batted in a restrained manner when needed. Sir-prise !!!His best delivery: As if being ICC Cricketer of the Year and Test Cricketer of the Year wasnt enough, Ravi Ashwin turned even more adorable becoming daddy to Daughter No 2. I delivered carrom baby #2 on the 21st Ashwins better half Prithi tweeted.Cricket gone to the dogs: England tried relentlessly to stop Pujara and Kohlis onslaught at Vizag. But a pitch-invader was more successful than the visitors. The game was halted when the dog was chased away, only to see it return after a while. A mongrel more dogged than the Poms and their three lions. Move over 007s, our Vizag dog has 700 followers on Twitter.Adding (financial) injury to insult: The Poms came here and literally paid for their defeats. The BCCI made the England team pay their own expenses under the pretext of a court ruling. Interest on the Kohinoor in instalments?Lights, camerapink: Not many expected the Ranji Trophy to get the much needed facelift this season. First, zonal system was scrapped. Then a shiny, pink ball and fully-lit up flood-lights suddenly gave Duleep the leap.You cant see me: Smog had its desolation moment in cricket. With visibility affected, Bengal-Gujarat and Hyderabad-Tripura  played in Delhi, split points. Bengal players had updated from monkey caps this winter to vogmasks.Goose cooked: South Africa are known to trigger captaincy changes in England with Nasser Hussain, Michael Vaughan and Andrew Strauss stepping down after home series defeats against the Proteas. India can lay claim to Alastair Cooks head though.Wheres the star: The great AB de Villiers couldnt bat in Australia. 2016 mustve been really rotten.Reality check: By not playing the Ranji Trophy this term, Harbhajan Singh might have scripted a silent version of farewell to Tests. Ashwin now has Jayant Yadav for company.Too spicy for everyone: Heard of too many cooks spoiling the broth? Well South Africa have kind of dissed that myth. They are yet to lose a Test when both Stephen Cook and Keshav Maharaj have played together.South America is not South Asia: Months before Rio, Indias South Asian games tally: Gold: 188, Silver: 90 silver, Bronze: 30. Post-truth again.Tongas topless man for all seasons: Pita Taufatofua, the Taekwondo athlete, walked carrying Tongas flag, topless, his ripping torso oiled at the Rio opening ceremony. Hes threatening to qualify for Pyeongchangs Winter Olympics in two years time in cross-country skiing. Hell need a few thermals there though.All bases covered: Standing on the Olympic podium, under the US flag, wearing a hijab. Ibtihaj Muhammad, a Muslim girl from Maplewood, picked fencing since that would mean wearing the mask, glove, jacket, pants on sporting arena.One for the upstart: Didnt see it, Cant believe it, sang Marc Antony. Neither did Puerto Ricans imagine it. But Monica Puig won Olympics gold in tennis singles. Strains of Ricky Martins Cup of Life rent the air, this time for his compatriot.China is never too far away: It was PV Sindhu in yellow vs Carolina Marin in red that finals day of womens singles at Rio, the two hues being Chinas predominant playing colours. Shockingly, no Chinese eventually made the podium.Diving into matrimony: The Chinese decided to turn cute this Olympics. He Zi, moments after receiving a silver medal for 3m springboarding, was offered another piece of silverware. An engagement ring this time. Fellow diver and boyfriend Qin Kai went down on his knee to say the magical words. Zis ji followed.None of the above: Indias Entry List for 74kg Freestle Wrestling (Mens): Option A: Narsingh Yadav; Option B: Sushil Kumar; Option C: Parveen Rana; Option D: No one. ANSWER: D for Duh. Dont. Get. Us. Started. On. This. One.Leap into history: Sachin didnt know there was no R in Karma(r)kar two years ago when he first met Dipa, the Tripura gymnast. But everyone agreed there could be an extra U in Pro(u)dunova after Indias sensational 4th place finish in Vault.Phelps schooled: Michael Phelps may have ended the year with a photo shoot that rivalled only the gold adorning the Reddy daughter at her wedding. But Joseph Schooling, literally an autograph-seeking school-boy when Phelps last visited his home Singapore, pipped the American to the 100m fly gold.Breaking down walls: Olympics was all about climbing podiums. Now its climbing walls. The webs sport weaves to welcome Spidermen.Down Under: The Kookaburras had won everything in the lead-up to Rio, before the Dutch ditched them out in quarters. They failed to score against Spain, Belgium and The Netherlands. Come to think of it, India couldve fancied its chances against Aussies, atoning all prior sins in the grand flowing Amazon.Fashioning heartbreaks, German Hockey Style: India beaten with 3 seconds to go; Argentina denied win with a goal 8 seconds from time; and Kiwis stunned with 1 second remaining on the clock.Rising to the occasion: They were boring. Didnt win a game in 90 minutes. Finished third in their group. Dont know if Portugal were good or others that bad at Euros. But then, Ronaldo now has what Messi doesnt  a major international title. 2016s settled the matter.Having England on ice: Icelands dream run, surely, was over. But they had it in them to score a goal more than England in the Round of 16 of Euro 2016. It wound up with Roy Hodgson resigning as England coach.Stay original: The Viking Clap celebration looked good on Iceland. France trying to do an Iceland after their Euro semifinal win over Germany, though, drew a lot of criticism for their lack of creativity.Friendly fire: Sania Mirza and Martina Hingis won the Australian Open, and then made a Grand Slam final at the French, but against each other in mixed doubles. Irony is the partnership would break before the Olympics, the only tournament they arent allowed to pair up together. Not with  nor without you.Everyone loves a winner: World number 1. Wimbledon champ. And Olympic gold. Andy Murrays British identity looks safe by the end of 2016. Until he starts losing and becomes Scottish again.Rivalry for the ages: Indias next Davis Cup captain will be younger than the oldest active player. If theres one thing we know about Leander Paes-Mahesh Bhupathi, it is that never put them in a year-ending list with finality. 20 years down the line, theyll still be at it  whatever the it is; love, hate, intrigue.Show me the money: While the general public reeled under the governments demonetisation drive, Mahesh Bhupathis International Premier Tennis League came and went without much fanfare and organisers of the Pro Wrestling League had to postpone the second edition due to cash crunch. Even Ranji Trophy teams struggled with daily allowances. Nothing la la about these Ligas.On auto pilot: Its Team Principal and managing director is absconding and chairman and co-owner Subrata Roy is out of jail on parole. And yet, Force India left all off the track problems in their slipstream in their best year ever in Formula One. They notched up a fourth-place finish, ahead of Williams and the iconic McLaren.A Lion in winter: Tiger has mellowed with age, injuries and lack of success. He was seen babysitting his teammates kids during the Ryder Cup, ensuring their families were having a good time while Team USA was conquering Europe. Who Woodve thunk!Cubs become LIons: Chicago Cubs recorded a no-hitter (when a team is not able to record a single hit) on April 21. It sat nicely with their moniker Lovable Losers. Seven months later they ended a 108 year curse to be crowned World Series champions. Americas staple of fairytale wins.Paving the way: In combat sports, UFC superstar Conor McGregor of Ireland showed his lightning-fast hands to match that motormouth. But the real story was Stipe Miocic of Cleveland. The Ohio native, a huge underdog, upset Fabricio Werdum in his den in Curitiba, Brazil, in a first-round knockout breaking the states longstanding sports curse. The Cavs followed in the NBA finals.Rest in peace: Circa 2016 proved to be bad for sports revolutionaries. Muhammad Ali, Johan Cruyff, Arnold Palmer and our very own Amal Dutta were taken out.And finally, again: L, E, I, C, E, S, T, E, R. When you think you cant do it, think of these letters of the English alphabet. In that order.

591f62b47be9e025a5d4dbcc,India set to go  on organic diet,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/521019/india-set-go-organic-diet.html,2016-01-03,,Deccan Herald,"Mamta Bhardwaj Jan 04, 2016, DHNS 23:58 ISTOne of the top 10 countries in the world in terms of cultivable land under organic certification, India has an organic food market estimated at around Rs 1,000 crore. According to a study prepared by industry body Assocham and TechSci Research, the Indian organic food market is growing at a strong 25-30 per cent rate, and is set to touch the $1.36 billion-mark by 2020.The study did, however, place constraints in terms of awareness. The level of awareness about organic food products in India is extremely low and is limited to consumers in metro cities, it said. While more growth is expected in future, as the government increases support, leaders in the industry spoke to Deccan Herald about its charecteristic features.Around 15 years back, people werent very particular about what they were eating. Even when we started in 2007, the first few years saw a lot of struggle. However, now, that is seen to be changing. Over the past two years, we have seen good traction, mostly for having been there. Also, consumer interest has improved now, with mounting interest in health, wellness and fitness in India, said N Balasubramanian, Chief Executive Officer, 24 Mantra Organic. 24 Mantra Organic is a leading organic food brand based out of Hyderabad. The company claims a 60 per cent share of the organic market (which does not include tea) in India, and is followed by brands like Pro Nature and Organic Tattva.Overall, organic food consumption in India is at 0.25 per cent and is set to touch two per cent by 2020, said Shailesh Mehta, CEO and Co-Founder of JoyByNature.com, quoting Dr Lorenzo Boni, project manager assistant of Bioagri Coop, an Italy-based non-profit organisation that contributes actively to the promotion and development of organic farming and sustainable development.JoyByNature.com is an online natural and organic products store housing authentic and certified organic, ayurvedic and natural products. Mehta notes that Indians have a natural tendency towards natural, herbal and organic, given that the price differential is not high. With a rich history of nature-based cures and therapies in India, awareness is there. The bigger issue is that of availability and affordability, Mehta said.Foody awarenessVipul Mittal, National Category Head, Fruits and Vegetables at Supermarket Grocery Supplies, which owns and manages BigBasket.com, concurs, saying, Over time, there has been a surge in customer awareness, and we have seen an informed shift towards some organic products.From a company perspective, Mittal said, In the market for categories like kitchen staples and fruits and vegetables, which are like raw materials for cooking, branding never really caught up. Organic provides that much needed differentiation to create a niche.Indian food basics potato, onion and tomato, within the fruits and vegetables category, and rice and wheat flour, within the kitchen staples category have been found to be the most popular products across the industry. It only goes to say that consumers making the shift to organic are in it for the long haul.The reverberating move towards wellness across the healthcare and fitness domains, has improved peoples understanding of the food mechanism in recent years, with food trends like organic food, veganism, fruitarianism, among others, catching up. Moreover, large sections of the educated urban masses have begun to see that the amount of money involved in medical expenditure is significantly higher than active healthcare. While organic food is one of the prominent aids for transforming towards a healthy life, it comes at a price.Cost of honesty bears downFor organic farming, firstly it takes three to four years for the soil to transform and get organic certification, second, the yield remains relatively low due to the lack of yield-boosting supplements in fertiilisers and hybrid seeds, said Balasubramanian, about how it is just the cost of honesty that puts pressure on the cost of production and therefore, prices. Premium pricing margins in the organic foods segment can range from as low as 10 per cent and may go up to 35-40 per cent. The monthly food supplies basket for a family of four costs about Rs 4,000. If the family switches to organic wholly, the price may go up by Rs 1,200-1,400, he said.Globally, 5-7 per cent of the consumer base is believed to have gone fully organic, he adds. Affordability plays a bigger role for those consumers, who Mittal categorises as fence-sitters. These fence-sitters understand some bit about organic, but continue to be concerned about the price. If the pressure from prices can be mitigated, this lot can be converted. Amongst kitchen basics, the premium is found to be lowest for wheat flour, where it is less than 20 per cent. It is higher for pulses, honey and groundnuts, among others, and can range anywhere between 35-40 per cent.At any time competing with non-organic will be difficult, he said, adding, When people realise the benefits of organics, the price doesnt pinch so much. At 24 Mantra Organic, being market leaders, we ensure that premiums are at a minimum, because we want to help people make the switch.Additionally, the segment is harrowed by inconsistency in supply, especially for perishables. Here, Mittal calls for instituitional intervention. Testing and standardisation for organic products is absent. There are process-based and field-based certifications, but no certification for the end product. This becomes a bigger problem for perishables, he said. Price premiums range from 30 per cent to even 300 per cent. By this standard, a shift in consumer behaviour may be far-fetched. Only when accessibility and affordability are resolved, can the larger portion of the consumer base, which does not understand organic, be approached, said Mittal.Organic shines onlineMarket research firm 6Wresearch in its study has said that the online grocery market is set to grow at a CAGR of 62 per cent between 2016-2022. It further placed Bengaluru as the key market for online grocery, followed by Mumbai and Delhi. The important thing to note here is that for non-organic products, online is just another channel of distribution; whereas for organic, eCommerce is more about market creation and customer acquisition, said Mehta.With dedicated organic grocery portals, including Farm2Kitchen, MyGreenKart, GreenNGood, Down2Earth and GrocBay, vying for a share in the organic food market, the bigger online grocers are not far behind. Some 45 per cent of BigBaskets product portfolio is consumed by kitchen staples and fruits and vegetables, and of this, 20 per cent is from the organic range. Organic products contribute up to 10 per cent of the total sales on the website, led by brand like 24 Mantra, Pro Nature and Organic Tattva.Balasubramaniam finds that across brick and mortar, and online stores, at least five per cent of the consumers are buying something organic. If in the next five years, we are able to achieve even a five per cent penetration at a household level, we could be looking at a Rs 30-crore market in India, he said. Ultimately, it is about making organic the first choice of everything, he said.","mamta bhardwaj jan 04, 2016, dhns 23:58 istone of the top 10 countries in the world in terms of cultivable land under

0.25 per cent and is set to touch two per cent by 2020, said shailesh mehta, ceo and co-founder of joybynature.com, quoting dr lorenzo boni, project manager assistant of bioagri coop, an italy-based non-profit organisation that contributes actively to the promotion and development of organic farming and sustainable development.joybynature.com is an online natural and organic products store housing authentic and certified organic, ayurvedic and natural products. mehta notes that indians have a natural tendency towards natural, herbal and organic, given that the price differential is not high. with a rich history of nature-based cures and therapies in india, awareness is there. the bigger issue is that of availability and affordability, mehta said.foody awarenessvipul mittal, national category head, fruits and vegetables at supermarket grocery supplies, which owns and manages bigbasket.com, concurs, saying, over time, there has been a surge in customer awareness, and we have seen an informed shift towards some organic products.from a company perspective, mittal said, in the market for categories like kitchen staples and fruits and vegetables, which are like raw materials for cooking, branding never really caught up. organic provides that much needed differentiation to create a niche.indian food basics potato, onion and tomato, within the fruits and vegetables category, and rice and wheat flour, within the kitchen staples category have been found to be the most popular products across the industry. it only goes to say that consumers making the shift to organic are in it for the long haul.the reverberating move towards wellness across the healthcare and fitness domains, has improved peoples understanding of the food mechanism in recent years, with food trends like organic food, veganism, fruitarianism, among others, catching up. moreover, large sections of the educated urban masses have begun to see that the amount of money involved in medical expenditure is significantly higher than active healthcare. while organic food is one of the prominent aids for transforming towards a healthy life, it comes at a price.cost of honesty bears downfor organic farming, firstly it takes three to four years for the soil to transform and get organic certification, second, the yield remains relatively low due to the lack of yield-boosting supplements in fertiilisers and hybrid seeds, said balasubramanian, about how it is just the cost of honesty that puts pressure on the cost of production and therefore, prices. premium pricing margins in the organic foods segment can range from as low as 10 per cent and may go up to 35-40 per cent. the monthly food supplies basket for a family of four costs about rs 4,000. if the family switches to organic wholly, the price may go up by rs 1,200-1,400, he said.globally, 5-7 per cent of the consumer base is believed to have gone fully organic, he adds. affordability plays a bigger role for those consumers, who mittal categorises as fence-sitters. these fence-sitters understand some bit about organic, but continue to be concerned about the price. if the pressure from prices can be mitigated, this lot can be converted. amongst kitchen basics, the premium is found to be lowest for wheat flour, where it is less than 20 per cent. it is higher for pulses, honey and groundnuts, among others, and can range anywhere between 35-40 per cent.at any time competing with non-organic will be difficult, he said, adding, when people realise the benefits of organics, the price doesnt pinch so much. at 24 mantra organic, being market leaders, we ensure that premiums are at a minimum, because we want to help people make the switch.additionally, the segment is harrowed by inconsistency in supply, especially for perishables. here, mittal calls for instituitional intervention. testing and standardisation for organic products is absent. there are process-based and field-based certifications, but no certification for the end product. this becomes a bigger problem for perishables, he said. price premiums range from 30 per cent to even 300 per cent. by this standard, a shift in consumer behaviour may be far-fetched. only when accessibility and affordability are resolved, can the larger portion of the consumer base, which does not understand organic, be approached, said mittal.organic shines onlinemarket research firm 6wresearch in its study has said that the online grocery market is set to grow at a cagr of 62 per cent between 2016-2022. it further placed bengaluru as the key market for online grocery, followed by mumbai and delhi. the important thing to note here is that for non-organic products, online is just another channel of distribution; whereas for organic, ecommerce is more about market creation and customer acquisition, said mehta.with dedicated organic grocery portals, including farm2kitchen, mygreenkart, greenngood, down2earth and grocbay, vying for a share in the organic food market, the bigger online grocers are not far behind. some 45 per cent of bigbaskets product portfolio is consumed by kitchen staples and fruits and vegetables, and of this, 20 per cent is from the organic range. organic products contribute up to 10 per cent of the total sales on the website, led by brand like 24 mantra, pro nature and organic tattva.balasubramaniam finds that across brick and mortar, and online stores, at least five per cent of the consumers are buying something organic. if in the next five years, we are able to achieve even a five per cent penetration at a household level, we could be looking at a rs 30-crore market in india, he said. ultimately, it is about making organic the first choice of everything, he said."
591fba827be9e025a5d51795,"FM hits back at Rahul, says NDA has brought down inflation",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/560718/fm-hits-back-rahul-says.html,2016-07-28,,Deccan Herald,"New Delhi, Jul 28, 2016, PTI 20:16 ISTHitting back at Rahul Gandhi, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today reeled out statistics in Lok Sabha to assert that the NDA government had brought down inflation and expressed hope that prices of essential commodites will come down further after a ""good"" monsoon.After Gandhi attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and alleged that the government had failed to control prices, particularly of the essential commodities, Jaitley contended that the NDA government had inherited high inflation from the UPA dispensation.""Any form of bluster is not substitute of statistics,"" he told the Congress Vice President while intervening in a debate on price rise and asked him to compare the status of inflation during the UPA government and that prevailing now.Referring to Gandhi's attack on Modi for criticising the then Congress-led government over inflation in February 2014, Jaitley said, ""This is a topic of statistics and not sloganeering. The UPA had left government in a serious state and it is but natural that any contesting candidate before election would say that if I come to power, I will try to bring inflation down. No one should have any objection to that.""Insisting that the Modi government had reduced inflation and kept it under control, the Finance Minister said he expects it to reduce further with a ""good"" monsoon.He acknowledged that high prices of pulses is a concern and said steps are being taken to address this by narrowing the mismatch between demand and supply.Noting that India has the highest production along with highest consumption of pulses, he said while the demand is for 23 million tonnes, the production was 17 million tonnes, leaving a gap of six million tonnes.The output of pulses is expected to go up to 20 million tonnes this crop year, Jaitley said, adding steps are also being taken by the Food Ministry to create a buffer of 20 lakh tonnes of pulses to keep the prices under control.He also criticised Gandhi for asking the Prime Minister to set a date by when the prices will come down, saying issues are settled through policies rather than giving dates.The government is working on policies to encourage farmers to produce more and India is moving towards self sufficiency in pulses produce, he said.""You are talking about a government which left behind double digit inflation and today we have a situation where steps have been taken in each sector to contain inflation. Any form of bluster is not a substitute for statistics. These are backed by hard facts,"" Jaitley said.Jaitley said the monthly statistics shows the pulses inflation is coming down and asked Rahul Gandhi not to look for corruption angle in the rise of prices of pulses, which he said occurred due to rise in costs globally besides two consecutive years of drought.""Even today the corruption scandals that emerge are those of UPAs and not NDA... We have contained inflation despite having two years of drought. Good monsoon helps economy and with good monsoon this year, I expect that the prices of will come down,"" Jaitley said.He said the UPA had left the economy in a dire state, with Consumer Price Index (CPI) and food inflation at double digit, WPI inflation around 6-7 per cent and growth prospects were limited.He cautioned UPA against indulging in ""back of envelop calculations"" regarding economic data stating it will only be ""misleading"".Taking a jibe at Gandhi for quoting market prices of essential commodities, Jaitley said in a lighter vein, ""everybody in this House seems to be claiming to go to market everyday"".He said in 2012-13 and 2013-14, which were the last two years of UPA regime, were marked by increasing prices and inflation data looked grim.The NDA government has brought down inflation and for 18 straight months, the country has witnessed negative WPI inflation, the Finance Minister said.Giving reply to members' concerns on how the government has utilised the gains on account of drop in crude oil prices, Jaitley said the gains have been utilised in three ways -- to help oil PSUs to reduce their losses on account of subsidy, to invest in infrastructure and benefit common people by enabling them to shell out less money in buying petroleum products.He said 42 per cent of the gains due to fall in global crude oil prices is shared with the states with the Centre retaining 58 per cent of the share.""It is because of these policies to shore up public investment that for two years in a row that India has emerged as the fastest growing economy. It is mainly because of public inbvestment and foreign investment that we are growing at a respectable rate, but we are not satisfied as we have greater potential,"" Jaitley said.""When the going is good, economies grow, but it is only when the going is challenging then the real challenge arises,"" he said.Countering Gandhi's remark that the UPA government had waived off farm loans, Jaitley said the NDA government's policies are not one-time and are instead more sustainable towards building rural infrastructure, irrigation facility and sanitation for upliftment of poor.""All these steps taken by the government will propel India to better economy,"" he said.Jaitley said July is the month when, due to seasonal factors, food inflation usually sees an upward trend and after the new crop comes, prices would fall.Terming as ""new economic equation"" Gandhi's remarks that prices of pulses should come down when MSPs are hiked, Jaitley said inflation is a matter of demand-supply mismatch.""This equation I have heard for the first time. The situation is that MSP of pulses is raised but production did not increase and there was two consecutive years of rainfall shortage,"" he said, adding this year rain Gods have been kind enough.He said there is demand for 23 MT of pulses this year while the output is 17 MT. The remaining 6 MT would be procured from Myanmar, Mozambique and Tanzania.The acreage data for the new crop year shows that the output will go up to 20 million tonnes and the government is working towards increasing the buffer stock to 20 lakh tonnes.With regard to sugar prices, Jaitley said the current price is reeling around Rs 33-34/kg and the government is working to lower it by Rs 1-2/ kg to ensure right price to consumers and better returns to farmers.He said sugar price had come down to Rs 22-23/kg and farmers were not able to get their cost back and sugar mills were on the verge of closing down. The total dues of farmers from mills have been brought down from Rs 27,000 crore to Rs 1,800 crore.When prices started going up to Rs 40 per kg, the government brought in export restriction and that cooled prices, the Finance Minister said.As regards onion prices, Jaitley said prices were lower till 3-4 months back and the Centre had to purchase 20,000 tonnes extra produce from farmers.Tomato prices, he assured, will come down after the monsoon season.Jaitley said the UPA government policies had led to a situation where global publications were talking about policy paralysis and exit of 'I' from BRICS grouping.""Private investment was weak, the state of economy was such that banking system's ability to support growth had come down,"" he said, adding that back of envelop calculations not necessarily forms part of good economic policies.Defending the move to hike excise duty on petrol and diesel when global crude oil prices were falling, Jaitley said at a time when global growth was witnessing slowdown and banks had limited capacity to lend, the government had no other option than to garner as much resources as possible to stabilise the economy.When oil prices slumped in the second half of 2014 and 2015, the government hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel nine times to mop up additional revenues that helped it meet ts revenue and fiscal deficit targets. In all, it raised excise duty on petrol by Rs 11.77 a litre and that on diesel by Rs 13.47 a litre.Participating in the debate, Saugata Ray (TMC) said the government's economic policies are based on two parameters-- windfall from crude prices and cess pool.He said the Finance Minister failed to provide a clear roadmap as to how it plans to bring down prices and instead he pinned his hope on good monsoon. He wanted to know why the government acts only after the prices have moved up.He said the Prime Minister, who had been meeting world leaders including US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, did not hold a single meeting on price rise.Hukmdev Narayan Yadav (BJP) said the opposition is frustrated with the government as it is taking several steps to bring back black money and hence they are trying to raise the matter of price rise in the House.B Mahtab (BJD) said both the Congress-led UPA and BJP-led NDA have failed to tame the demon of inflation.""Prise rise is symptom and inflation is disease"", he said, adding unless the government deals with inflation it would not be possible to contain inflation.Mahtab added that the government should deal with the supply side issues to contain inflation which has been adversely affecting the large section of population.Apparently referring to RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, he said the person who has been trying to deal with inflation is now going back to Chicago because someone in the ruling dispensation has asserted that he was not a nationalist.Tariq Anwar (NCP) said before coming to power NDA leaders promised to bring down inflation but have nothing to contain price rise.Describing Jaitley's intervention during the debate as ""disappointing"", Anwar said people have no choice but to bear the burden of rising prices.Taking a dig at Modi's initiative to provide cooking gas to poor, he said, now the people have gas but nothing to cook as essential kitchen items are beyond his reach.He wanted to know why the government always fails to take advance action to deal with rising prices.Jayadev Galla (TDP) suggested that central government should have a separate budget for agriculture sector though it could very well merge railway budget with the general budget.He further said that government should consider including pulses in the ambit of the Food Security Act and increase food subsidy to 10 per cent of the GDP from a little of two per cent presently.BJP member Poonam Mahajan blamed the previous UPA governments for the price rise situation and said whenever Congress was in power inflation has gone up.Taking a swipe at Rahul Gandhi, she wondered how the 'yuvraj' (prince) did not know about the price situation when UPA was in power from 2004-2014.She said one day Rahul is having tea here and another day at Kalavati's home, which she termed as ""political tourism"".Gandhi had visited the home of Kalavati Bandurkar, the Vidarbha farmer widow in 2008, and had also mentioned about her in Parliament.Mahajan described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as 'Loh purush' (Iron Man)' and said the ""sleeping beauty who sleeps here is questioning the 'Iron Man',"" an apparent reference to the Congress Vice President.She said Congress had played politics with the slogan of 'Gharibi Hataao (eradicate poverty)' for a long time.Referring to her home state Maharashtra, she claimed that a large number of farmers committed suicide during the time of Congress governments.Shrirang Appa Barne (Shiv Sena) said the government has not been able to control the price situation even though efforts are being made. The government's priority should be to control price rise, which is affecting poor people the most, he added.Dharmendra Yadav (SP) said farmers have not received any benefit from price rise, adding that there does not seem to be much difference between Congress and BJP governments as under both of them farmers have been weakened.Jayprakash Narayan Yadav (RJD) cautioned that the ""tsunami of price rise"" is a bad signal for the government.Stating that mere use of sophisticated words cannot help in controlling price rise, A P Jithender Reddy (TRS) said lot of people are feeling the pinch. He also urged the government to ""bailout people"" from the clutches of inflation.M Rajamohan Reddy (YSR Cong) urged the government to put in place a comprehensive food pricing and management policy.Kaushalendra Kumar (JD-U), Riti Pathak and Uday Pratap Singh (both BJP) also spoke.","new delhi, jul 28, 2016, pti 20:16 isthitting back at rahul gandhi, finance minister arun jaitley today

Edna Pesis (left) and Susan Luria.After drip irrigation-cum-fertigation, tissue culture and protected cultivation of vegetables, fruits and flowers, dissemination of Israeli post-harvest know-how is the latest focus of the Indo-Israel Agricultural Project (IIAP).Value-addition in horticultural crops is not just about processing and selling juices. It is also about technologies to maintain the quality of fresh produce for delivering in that form to consumers in distant locations or to harvest, say, pomegranates in September for selling in the US or Europe during the Christmas and New Year season, points out Susan Lurie, professor emeritus at the Department of Postharvest Science of Fresh Produce in the Agricultural Research Organization of Israels Ministry of Agriculture.Israel, according to her, has lot to offer to India when it comes to preservation of quality  texture, appearance, colour, taste, aroma, and nutritional and health attributes  of fresh farm produce, especially for exports to foreign markets.Most of what we produce  from cherry tomatoes and capsicum to mangoes, bananas, pomegranates, lychees, guavas and papayas  is for selling outside Israel. Unlike us, India is big and more like the US, where they grow in California to sell in New York or Boston. Theres no reason you cannot do the same here, which is where we can help, adds Lurie.Edna Pesis, an expert from the same department that is said to be the worlds largest research centre for post-harvest management, illustrates this through the example of mangoes. Mangoes are susceptible to diseases after harvest and prolonged storage, as a result of psychological changes occurring in the fruits that enable fungal pathogen development.An effective means to address the problem is through hot water brushing treatment  spraying a jet of water at about 52 degrees Celsius for 15-20 seconds on the harvested fruits in packing lines. This is followed by drying and waxing or wrapping the fruits with a layer of organic/synthetic waxing material. Hot water brushing significantly reduces decay from fungal development, while waxing prevents water loss that leads to shrinkage and premature ripening of the fruits. Both together help improve the keeping quality and general appearance of the mangoes in supermarket shelves.These apart, there are also other technologies like modified atmosphere packaging that involves covering the fresh produce with special permeable plastic films to reduce humidity. Fruits and vegetables are naturally respiring products, resulting in the condensation of their vapours into water and lowering shelf life. The mistake many people do is to take the harvested fruits directly to the cold storage. Doing that can cause not only shrinkage, but also makes the fruits prone to scalding and chilling injury, explains Pesis.The two Israeli women scientist-experts are part of a visiting team under the IIAP, a programme currently operational in nine states: Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. We are now extending this to six other states: Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Mizoram and Goa, says Dan Alluf, Counsellor (Science & Agriculture) with Mashav, Israels Agency for International Development Corporation.The IIAP, which is a joint collaboration between Mashav and the Indian governments Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture plus the participating states, is being implemented via centres of excellence.Currently, there are 14 such fully active centres: four in Maharashtra (for citrus, pomegranate, and Alphonso and Kesar mangoes), three in Haryana (vegetables, citrus, pomegranate and mango), two in Gujarat (Kesar mango and vegetables), two in Rajasthan (pomegranate and citrus), two in Punjab (vegetables and citrus) and one in Tamil Nadu (vegetables).The programme began in 2009.

59235f937be9e01fcef0202a,Farming with waste water a health hazard,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/543694/farming-waste-water-health-hazard.html,2016-04-30,,Deccan Herald,"Farming with waste water a health hazardNivedita Jain, Bengaluru, May 1, 2016, DHNS 1:48 ISTPolluted air and water might be Bengalurus bane, but vegetables grown on farms irrigated with contaminated water have given it a hazardous twist. Interactions with farmers, retailers and consumers indicate that a big chunk of vegetables arriving in markets across the City might show chemical contamination if tested.Puroshottam Gowda, a farmer from Ballari opines that the share of such vegetables could be as high as 75%. Most of the vegetables are grown near Kengeri and surrounding areas. The farmers grow greens, tomato, cabbage and other vegetables using water from a sewage treatment plant. The water is supposed to be purified but at most places, the plants do not work. This is unfortunate.""However, RV Gopi, President, Wholesale Vegetables and Fruits Traders Merchant Association, does not agree. According to him, drainage water was earlier being used by vegetable growers in Kengeri, Gollahalli and Varthur. But now, says he, most of the farmers have stopped vegetable farming there due to encroachment of lakes and rapid urbanisation.Sellers and middlemen at Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Yard, Yeshwantpur admit that the quality of fruits and vegetables has come down because of bad water quality and pollution.Yet, there are many others who deny using dirty water to grow greens. Suresh, a wholesale onion and potato merchant from APMC contends that most of his produce comes from Maharashtra and Chitradurga region. He says the farmers there depend on borewell water and tap water to grow vegetables and not drainage.Hoskote-based farmer Chandra Gowda claims he uses borewell water for vegetable farming. But he has seen a few farmers using water from polluted lakes in his locality.Environmentalists suggest that reducing pollution at water source points and increasing awareness among public on the dangers of consuming food with high heavy metal contamination could be helpful. But consumers say they are helpless. Despite knowing the harmful effects of chemical contamination, they have no choice but to buy the fruits and vegetables from the markets.Says Sheela Kumar, a resident of Hennur: Today, everything from water to air to soil is contaminated. I try washing fruits and vegetables with running water as many times as possible and boil them properly before consuming them. We cannot avoid consuming them. Taking precautionary measures is the best available option.Malini Parmar, a resident of Bellandur and an active member of Kasa Muktha Bellandur, informs that BBMP had conducted a drive in her locality to seize plastics. The Palike personnel confiscated boxes filled with artificial colouring content from vegetable farmers. These were used to add colour to peas.Parmar sees a way out in using organic vegetables. She explains, The best way to avoid consumption of harmful produce is by buying organic produce. Though it is expensive, it is worth as it keeps me and my family healthy. Apart from sewage effluents inside the lake, garbage is also being burnt and dumped there. I see ashes floating atop Bellandur lake due to burning of waste.Malleswaram resident Sampath Kumar agrees that organic vegetables could be an option only if people can afford them. Not everyone can buy organic stuff, he points out.","farming with waste water a health hazardnivedita jain, bengaluru, may 1, 2016, dhns 1:48 istpolluted air and water might be bengalurus bane, but vegetables grown on farms irrigated with contaminated water have given it a hazardous twist. interactions with farmers, retailers and consumers indicate that a big chunk of vegetables arriving in markets across the city might show chemical contamination if tested.puroshottam gowda, a farmer from ballari opines that the share of such vegetables could be as high as 75%. most of the vegetables are grown near kengeri and surrounding areas. the farmers grow greens, tomato, cabbage and other vegetables using water from a sewage treatment plant. the water is supposed to be purified but at most places, the plants do not work. this is unfortunate.""however, rv gopi, president, wholesale vegetables and fruits traders merchant association, does not agree. according to him, drainage water was earlier being used by vegetable growers in kengeri, gollahalli and varthur. but now, says he, most of the farmers have stopped vegetable farming there due to encroachment of lakes and rapid urbanisation.sellers and middlemen at agricultural produce marketing committee (apmc) yard, yeshwantpur admit that the quality of fruits and vegetables has come down because of bad water quality and pollution.yet, there are many others who deny using dirty water to grow greens. suresh, a wholesale onion and potato merchant from apmc contends that most of his produce comes from maharashtra and chitradurga region. he says the farmers there depend on borewell water and tap water to grow vegetables and not drainage.hoskote-based farmer chandra gowda claims he uses borewell water for vegetable farming. but he has seen a few farmers using water from polluted lakes in his locality.environmentalists suggest that reducing pollution at water source points and increasing awareness among public on the dangers of consuming food with high heavy metal contamination could be helpful. but consumers say they are helpless. despite knowing the harmful effects of chemical contamination, they have no choice but to buy the fruits and vegetables from the markets.says sheela kumar, a resident of hennur: today, everything from water to air to soil is contaminated. i try washing fruits and vegetables with running water as many times as possible and boil them properly before consuming them. we cannot avoid consuming them. taking precautionary measures is the best available option.malini parmar, a resident of bellandur and an active member of kasa muktha bellandur, informs that bbmp had conducted a drive in her locality to seize plastics. the palike personnel confiscated boxes filled with artificial colouring content from vegetable farmers. these were used to add colour to peas.parmar sees a way out in using organic vegetables. she explains, the best way to avoid consumption of harmful produce is by buying organic produce. though it is expensive, it is worth as it keeps me and my family healthy. apart from sewage effluents inside the lake, garbage is also being burnt and dumped there. i see ashes floating atop bellandur lake due to burning of waste.malleswaram resident sampath kumar agrees that organic vegetables could be an option only if people can afford them. not everyone can buy organic stuff, he points out."

The Khar police station registered a case against Mumbai-based Poncho Hospitality Pvt. Ltd, which owns and operates a quick service restaurant (QSR) chain under the brand name of Box8. Unknown employees of the company have been booked for offences affecting public health and safety under the Indian Penal Code.The incident occurred on Thursday afternoon during events organised by the India International Model United Nations (IIMUN), a non-political network of students. Nearly 4,000 students from different colleges were part of the seminar at four venues. About 1,000 consumed the lunch, police said.According to statements recorded by the police, the organizers said the food was manufactured and packed in Bandra Kurla Complex. Investigations, however, reveal the food came from Thane, said Police Inspector Dinesh Kadam of Khar police.We have not yet made any arrests. We are following logistics chain of the food unit and looking for lapses. Prima facie it appears the food was spoilt due to a delay but who is responsible has still not been revealed from our investigation, said a senior police officer.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday carried out an inspection of Box8 factory in Thane from where the food parcels, containing rajma, rice and tomato curry, were prepared. We are inspecting how the food was prepared, if any sub-standard procedures were followed.

593cc4447be9e00e964d386d,PM Modi’s interview with Arnab Goswami: Full transcript,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/pm-modis-interview-with-arnab-goswami-full-transcript-2879832/,2016-06-28,,Indian Express,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an interview with Times Now has shared his views on a range of issues. Here is the complete transcript of the Prime Ministers interview with Arnab Goswami.ARNAB: Prime Minister Modi thank you very much for this interview. Thank you very muchPM MODI: My greetings to all the peopleARNAB: This is your first one to one interview to a private news channel since you became Prime Minister. And if I am not mistaken, this is the first ever interview by a sitting Prime Minister of India to a private television news channel in the country. So I would first like to thank you and am very grateful for the opportunity.PM MODI: The world of the media has grown so big that everybody has to attach themselves with it.Watch Video: Whats making newsARNAB: I am very grateful and our viewers will be very grateful also Mr Modi because they want to hear your views on a range of subjects. Mr Prime Minister I would like to start by taking you back to 20th May 2014. The results came on May 16th. Four days later, you gave a historic speech in the Central Hall of Parliament and you were speaking to the members of Parliament. You had said four days after the results that an era of responsibility has begun. And that you said that in 2019 before the elections, I will come back to this Parliament, I will come back to the MPs and I will give my report card. Forty percent into your tenure, how much have you achieved of your own targets?PM MODI: When I went for the first time as an MP to the Central Hall, and it was the first time I was seeing the Central Hall. I had not been there before. So I had then said that becoming the Prime Minister was not about the designation of the office but it was about the responsibilities and work of being a PM. I had also said that my government would be committed to the poor. I was completely new in the job. Delhi was new for me. The Delhi environment was new to me. The work of the government of India was also new for me. But despite that, in such a short time, the pace at which the country has moved forward, and its not on one subject. You can pick up any aspect of the governments functioning, and if you make a comparison with the past governments, then you will realize that no issue has been ignored. There has been an effort to bring in something new in every area. There is an effort to bring in change in every area. One big challenge was that I was not experienced about this place, I had not even been an MP. The office was new, the questions were also new. But when I look at the second biggest challenge, we should remember those days when the country was engulfed in disappointment. The everyday news was about whether there would be any electricity production after seven days, whether coal would be supplied or not. This was the situation then. The entire system was engulfed in disappointment. The big challenge was to inject new trust into the system and create confidence among the citizens. It is very difficult to evaluate this from the outside but I have gone through it. But today I can say with a lot of satisfaction that now there is no trace of any disappointment. The intention to do something is visible. And its not in words but in actual achievement. I had said that within a given timeframe, we will open bank accounts for the poor. For something that had not been done for 60 years, setting a timeframe for it was in itself a risk. But because of that a trust was created in the system that it was something doable. So thats the process I started for awakening the confidence. And today you can see that in every sector, the changed circumstances can be seen. While evaluating the performance of this government, never forget that you will have to make that evaluation in comparison with the 10 years of the previous government. Only then will you know where we were and where we are now. We should not be talking about what we are aiming for. For now you will have to assess the present in comparison with the immediate past and in that you will find a bright future.ARNAB: Mr. Modi, I want to start now on the issue of foreign policy. In the area of foreign policy, you have taken great personal interest. The amount of personal interest you have shown in foreign policy, probably none of the previous Prime Ministers showed the same kind of interest. Your approach is pro active. What I find interesting about your foreign policy is that you have balanced different powers and different interests. On the one side, your relationship with US, you made sure that India enters the Missile Control Technology Regime with them. A week before that you also signed the historic Chabahar Port Agreement with Iran. So, you have balanced very diverse forces. My question to you over this is that, is it easy to do that as an Indian Prime Minister? Secondly, on the issue of the NSG, you staked a lot of personal interest, personal push, you lobbied actively. How close are we to getting the NSG seat?PM MODI: Firstly, about foreign policy, you need to know what has strengthened our foreign policy. For 30 years, in our country, the government was unstable. For 30 years, party with a clear mandate wasnt given the opportunity to form the government. The world measures the government of a nation on the basis of its condition in its own country, on how strong their word is in their own country. I am thankful to the people of this country, that after 30 years, they chose a government with absolute majority and this has had an impact on world politics. Countries and world leaders have changed their perspective towards India. This is the biggest benefit. Secondly, the world didnt know me. The world wants to know who the head of the state is. If someone would want to know Modi through the eyes of the media, then he would be disillusioned on which modi is the real Modi. If this happens, the country will be at a loss. Modis personality shouldnt be a hindrance for the world to have faith in india. But for that unless I meet all those leaders and engage them them one to one, unless I speak to them frankly, they wouldnt know about indias head of state, so it was very important for me as I am not from a political family. I never had the opportunity to meet the world leaders earlier.ARNAB: You were an unknown entity in foreign policyPM MODI: More than foreign policy it was foreign relations. Yes, I was new to it. So for me, being pro active was mandatory. Thirdly, we work as a team. Foreign ministry, Prime Ministers officer, commerce ministry, finance ministry, defense minister, everyone works as a team, not as separate pieces. The impact that is now visible, is not just because of Modi, it is because of the team. All teams work in a particular direction. That is why the impact is seen, earlier these teams were splintered. We have seen instances where the party would give a statement, the prime minister would say something else, party leaders would say something else. This disunity has had a negative impact. Thirdly, we also need to understand that earlier the world was bi polar. Foreign policy would be centered around two super powers. India was a little late in realizing that this bi polar situation was for namesake. Now the entire world, in changed circumstances, especially in 21st century, it is more interdependent and inter connected, earlier, the foreign policy was possible between governments, but today it is not possible just between governments. Government relations are important but increasing people to people contact is equally important. Theres been a shift in paradigm. Because I do not have any previous baggage, because Ive had a clean slate, I write everything from beginning and that has a benefit. Today we are building relations with countries across the world. The amount of respect with which I engage saudi arabia, I engage Iran with the same amount of respect. The amount of respect with which I speak to America, I speak to russia with the same amount of respect. So we need to understand this. We also need to understand that we shouldnt consider smaller countries insignificant. I abide by this principle. The small countries of the world are as important as the big nations. We had assumed that the relations with smaller nations would develop under the shadow of the bigger nations. I brought about a change in this. You must have seen that I made a forum for the pacific island nations. We have had two meetings. I went there once and they came here once. These are small countries with a population of about 10 lakh or 20 lakh. But these small island nations are most affected by global warming. When india took up the international solar mission and 122 nations joined it, the island nations benefitted the most out of it. They are 50 in number now. A group of 50 nations, feels secured with this vision of India. If we try to understand this change, then we would realize that in the world, a few days back, I was sitting with the officers of our foreign services, so as we got talking, in a very poetic way I told them that there was a time when we used to sit by the sea and count the waves, but the time has now changed, we are done counting waves, now its time for us to steer ourselves, ride the waves and decide on our direction, destination and speed.ARNAB: That is apparent. You have a very aggressive foreign policy. But my second question was, you put so much effort for NSG membership. My question was, how close are we to NSG membership and were you disappointed that we did not make it at the very end because of Chinas opposition?PM MODI: Look the first thing is that India has been continuously making these efforts, no matter which government was in office. Be it the membership of the UN Security Council or the SCO membership or MTCR membership or NSG membership. Every government has made an effort. Its not that only this government is trying, its in continuity. But its during our tenure that we achieved SCO membership, we also got the MTCR membership. I have full faith that now we have begun a coordinated effort for the NSG membership too. The process has begun on a positive note. Everything has rules and will work accordingly and move forwardARNAB: Is it the problem of mindset with China? There have been 13 engagements at various levels between the Narendra Modi government and the Chinese government. The latest engagement was when you went to Tashkent. You spent some time with the Chinese President Xi Jinping. Yet it was seen that in the case of Masood Azhar, China blocked Indias UN bid to ban him. Now they have stalled Indias NSG bid. Why is China repeatedly blocking us Mr Prime Minister despite your personal proactive measures and your governments outreach?PM MODI: The first thing is that we have an ongoing dialogue with China and it should continue to happen. In foreign policy its not necessary to have similar views to have a conversation. Even when the views are contradictory, talks are the only way forward and problems should be resolved through dialogue. We dont have one problem with China, we have a whole lot of problems pending with China. Slowly and steadily, an effort is on to address these issues through talks and make them less cumbersome. I can say that China has been cooperating with India to search for solutions. On some issues, its a question of principles for them. On some issues, its a question of principles for us. On some issues they differ with us and there are issues on which we differ with them. There are some basic differences. But the most important thing is that we can speak to China eye-to-eye and put forth Indias interests in the most unambiguous manner. We are a government that takes care of Indias interests. We dont compromise on this. Three days ago I met the Chinese President. I told him clearly about Indias interests. They are a different country, we are a different countryARNAB: Do you think you will be able to change their mindset on the issue of NSG membership?PM MODI: See the foreign policy is not about changing mindsets. Foreign policy is about finding the common meeting points. Where do our interests converge and how much? We have to sit and talk with every country. Its our ongoing effortARNAB: This statement that you just made is also apt in the context of America where you gave a speech in the U.S Congress. By the way Mr Prime Minister it was a fantastic speechPM MODI: Thank youARNAB: There was a lot of humour. You were laughing and cracking jokes while you delivered the speech which was very unique. They also appreciated it. Was the speech impromptu?PM MODI: I have a humourous side but these days humour can be a risky thingARNAB: Why do you say that?PM MODI: In this era of 24/7 news channels, anybody can lift a small word and make a big issue out of it. But I will tell you the truth, the reason for the absence of humour in public life is this fear. I am myself scared . Earlier when I used to make speeches, I would make it so humourous but there would never be any issuesARNAB: Have you become more conscious now?PM MODI: I am not conscious. I am in fear, there is no humour left in public life because of this fear. Everyone is scared. I am in fear. My speeches used be humourous. I see it in Parliament, that humour is finished there too. It is a matter of concern. I will quote one proverb.ARNAB: Yes, go ahead.PM MODI: Even if you mention a proverb, they will connect it with something else and begin a conversation. The one who is saying the proverb does not know for what he is speaking.ARNAB: But you should not lose your sense of humour Mr Prime MinisterPM MODI: But it is true that my trip to the United States of America, my speech in their Congress and the respect shown towards India created a lot of hype. Had it not been hyped so much, there would not have been so much criticism on the NSG issue. Government is being criticized not for any mishandling of the NSG issue but because we were so successful over there (in the USA)ARNAB: Did China become conscious of your growing friendship with US?PM MODI: I am talking about whats happening hereARNAB: But when you delivered that speech in context of America, you used a very interesting phrase. You said We have to overcome the hesitations of history. My Hindi is not that good. Like hesitations of history. But my question to you is Mr Prime Minister, how close can we get to America because many Indians believe that America is still supporting Pakistan, giving them military assistance. How close can we get? At what point do we stop before we are seen like an American ally? What is your own world view on that?PM MODI: I would especially like to appeal to my countrys media that we should stop looking at everything in India from the . India is an independent country. It is a country of 125 crore people. Whenever it approaches any country, it will only be concerned about its own interests. It has been our biggest shortcoming and mistake that we have been tagging ourselves with another country and trying to do things. We are an independent country, we have our own policies and future. We have to think about the future of our 125 crore people. There should be no compromise on our interests. We have relations with America in the context of these fundamental pointsARNAB: How close can we get to them?PM MODI: There has been warmth in our relationship. You must have seen the editorials in American newspapers after my visit to that country. One point mentioned in those editorials was that the success of Obamas foreign policy has been the warm relationship with India. This has been saidARNAB: What you are saying Modiji is that we can be close to America but we need not be an ally or seen to be an ally?PM MODI: The first thing is that we no longer live in a bipolar world. The world is interconnected and interdependent. You will have to connect with everybody at the same time. Even if there are two opposing countries, they will have to be friends. Now the times have changedARNAB: Mr Modi, on 8th May 2014, I had the opportunity to interview you, the interview took place in Ahmedabad, I think one last phase of elections was left. We were discussing the issue of Pakistan. You have had an uncompromising approach towards Pakistan. Two days back, Lashkar E Toiba killed 8 CRPF jawans in an attack. In the 8th May interview, you put forth a very interesting phrase, you said Can talks be heard amidst the noise of bombs, guns and pistols? This is how you had phrased it. Do you believe we have been too generous towards Pakistan? Do you believe we have been too generous towards Pakistan?PM MODI: There are two things. One  India has always wanted friendly ties with its neighbours, there can be no debate around it. We want to live in harmony and peace. And I have said it repeatedly, that India has to fight poverty, Pakistan too has to fight poverty, why dont we come together to fight poverty? I said this before elections and during election campaigns. Also I had invited leaders of SAARC nations to my swearing in ceremony and they had attended it as well. So there has been no change in our intent, our thoughts and our current behaviour. Number two  those who have to work from the table, will work from the table and those who have to work at the border, will work at border with full strength. Each one will fulfill the responsibility entrusted to them. And our jawans are fulfilling their responsibilities. Its true that pressure on terrorists has increased, their schemes are proving unsuccessful. The intent with which they move forward are foiled and they have to face major challenges. It is because of this disappointment that such incidents are taking place and our jawans are risking their lives and protecting the country. We are very proud of our JawansARNAB: When your foreign policy is studied, observers analyze whats happening and whats not happening. If you give me the opportunity, I want to do a bit of analyses. There was a terrific pace of engagement with Pakistan between October, November and December. On 30th November, you met Nawaz Sharif on the sidelines (of UN Climate Summit in Paris). Both of you were seated on a sofa, talking to each other. A lot of people were speculating the contents of your conversation. This was on the sidelines of Climate Summit. After that, all of a sudden within seven days there were NSA level talks and Ajit Doval spoke to Nasir Janjua in Bangkok. And again after that you went to Russia via Afghanistan, you made an unexpected visit to Nawaz Sharif in Lahore. It was a personal trip but it still had some level of importance. Eight days later, Pakistani terrorists attacked Pathankot. Can you tell our viewers whether Pakistan was proactively responding in the months of October, November and December? Did the Pathankot terror attack change the situation? Is it true that Pakistan was making a lot of movement in those three months?PM MODI: Look there are different types of forces operating in Pakistan. But the government only engages with a democratically elected system. Our effort for that engagement is continuing. But our supreme objective is peace. Our supreme objective is to protect Indias interests. We keep making effort toward that objective and sometimes our efforts are successful. As far as meetings and talks are concerned, we signalled right from the day I took oath and sent invitations for the oath taking ceremony, that we seek friendly relations but without compromising on our interests. And that is why I have said that my countrys soldiers have full freedom to answer back in whatever manner they have to and they will keep doing thatARNAB: Mr Prime Minister what is the Lakshman Rekha that you would draw when it comes to Pakistan. There is some confusion surrounding this subject. I would like you to give an elaborate reply. In 2014, it was believed that if talks are being held, then they should be held between two countries and not with Hurriyat. It should be between the government of India and the government of Pakistan. The other Lakshman Rekha is that you must act on 26/11. Theres been no forward movement so far. The third thing is about forward movement on the Pathankot attack case. So what is the Lakshman Rekha now and if Pakistan remains within those bounds, so talks can happen at the political level or at any other level?PM MODI: The first thing is that with Pakistan, to whom do we talk to decide about the Lakshman Rekha. Will it be with the elected government or with other actors? That is why India will have to be on alert all the time. India will have to be alert every moment. There can never be any laxity in this. But there is an outcome due to my continuous efforts like my visit to Lahore and my invitation to the Pakistani Prime Minister to come to India. Now I dont have to explain to the world about Indias position. The world is unanimously appreciating Indias position. And the world is seeing that Pakistan is finding it difficult to respond. If we had become an obstacle, then we would have had to explain to the world that we are not that obstacle. Now we dont have to explain to the world. The world knows our intentions. Like on the issue of terrorism, the world never bought Indias theory on terrorism. They would sometime dismiss it by saying that its your law and order problem. Today the world has to accept what India has been saying about terrorism. Indias dialogue on terrorism, the losses India has suffered due to terrorism, the losses suffered by humanity, the world is now acknowledging that. So I believe we have to take this process forwardARNAB: Mr Prime Minister I now want to move to questions on the economy. In the past two years you have started many schemes. If we look at the theme of Jan Dhan Yojna for financial inclusion, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna for crop insurance, Swach Bharat, Skill India, Make In India. If we see the theme running through these schemes, is your social agenda at the core of your personal economic philosophy, social transformation? Is the social agenda at the core of your economic philosophy as the Prime Minister?PM MODI: The first point is our philosophy is to reach the last man in the line. Pandit Deendayal Upadhyays philosophy forms the core of our political, economic and social ideology. And even Mahatma Gandhi used to say that what is there for the last man? So my development parameter is very simple. It is about how the poorest of the poor can benefit from development. The poor is the central focus of my economic agenda. The poor should be strengthened in such a way that they get the willingness to defeat poverty. By helping the poor make ends meet while they remain in poverty is also one of the ways. I am not saying right or wrong but its one of the ways. But today the countrys situation is such that we should make the poor strong so that they become partners in defeating poverty. All these schemes are meant to empower the poor and change the quality of life. The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna is not only about opening bank accounts for the poor. Because of this the poor are feeling that they are becoming a part of the countrys economic system. The bank that he was seeing from afar, now he is able to enter that bank. This brings about a psychological transformation. Looked at in another way, did you ever imagine that 40 thousand crores could be injected into the banking system by contributions from the poor. The poor who never had bank accounts, have deposited 100 rupees, 50 rupees or 200 rupees. It means that poor man saved 100 rupees and the change began in his life. We have taken up construction of toilets. I had gone to Chhattisgarh and had the opportunity to get the blessings of one mother. An adivasi mother heard about the scheme for building toilets. She sold her four goats and built a toilet. That 90 old mother uses a walking stick and goes around the cluster of 30 or 40 houses in the tribal village and has been spreading the message to build toilets. This change is becoming the reason for the change in the quality of life. I have begun the cleanliness campaign. Its estimated an individual spends an average of 7000 rupees for treatment of a disease. The main reason for disease is filth. The poor suffer the most from the filth. If a poor man falls sick, he cannot drive his rickshaw for two days and his children go hungry. So how can we help the poor bring about change in their lives? Now there is a neo-middle class and a middle class in the country. The young have their aspirations. So another aspect of my policies you must have seen are the Start Up India, Stand Up India, Seaport activity, port activity, railways expansion, railway station upgradation. These changes directly appeal to the middle class. The middle class has its aspirations. We have to create jobs? How will job creation happen? Till I invest in the development of infrastructure, there be no job creation. You must have seen that the maximum electricity generation since Independence has occurred this year. The maximum amount of coal mined has been in this year. The maximum length of roads being constructed daily is happening in this year. The fastest loading and unloading of steamers at sea ports is happening now. All these changes are creating opportunities for employment like in Start up India, Stand Up India. For instance in Stand Up India, I have said that every bank should give an economic opportunity to one woman, one dalit or one tribal person to become entrepreneurs. This will create many job opportunities. So this is the basis of my economic philosophy.ARNAB: Mr Prime Minister if I could interrupt you on this. On the one hand is the peoples expectations and on the other is your vision. Many programs that you have mentioned, you cant put a calendar date to it but they dont have an immediate impact. They maybe able to show results in 3, 4, 5 maybe beyond 5 years. Now there are challenges in that. Mr Prime Minister, you are aware more than anyone else that people want immediate results. Now you spoke of job creation. The first thing, as an achievement you have managed to grow the economy at 7.5 per cent when the global economic climate is very bleak. You have spoken about it as well. You have met fiscal deficit targets, FDI inflows have increased but people are saying that job opportunities are not increasing. You have spoken about infrastructure but the current rate of unemployment. Mr Prime Minister, the latest Labour Bureau figures, is it a source of concern for you as the Prime Minister?PM MODI: The first thing is that are 800 million people below the age of 35 in our country. We have to accept that the demand for jobs is very high. But where will they get employment? Investment will come in. It will be used in the infrastructure sector, manufacturing and services sector. Now like the initiative we have taken, we have started the Mudra Yojna. More than three crore people in the country comprise washermen, barbers, milkman, newspaper vendors, cart vendors. We have given them nearly 1.25 lakh crore rupees without any guarantee. Now why have these people taken the money? To expand their work. When he expands his work, if he is currently employing one person, now he has to employ two people. If there were two employed earlier, now there are three. Now just think, when 3 crore of these small businesses have got access to finance, they must have expanded their work. Now all this is not in the Labour Departments registration. Three crore people have expanded their work. We took another small decision. The big malls in the country run 365 days a year but the smaller shops have to close on holidays. We announced in the Budget that even a small shopkeeper can operate his shop till late night and that too on all the seven days of the week. If the malls dont have restrictions then why should the small shopkeepers have restrictions. So now if a shopkeeper operates his shop till late and on all seven days, if he earlier employed one person, now he will have to employ two people. So wont the employment increase?ARNAB: So is your focus on entrepreneurship?PM MODI: Our focus is on all aspects. Now we are saying that by 2022 we want to ensure that everyone has a house. Housing sector has the maximum potential for creating employment. Houses will be built in such huge numbers, how many people will get employment? You must have seen that last year we brought in a textile policy. Under this textile policy, there will be income tax benefits for those who create employment. The more employment one creates, the more tax benefits they will get. For the first time, employment generation and tax has been linked. These are the things that boost employment and our central focus is creating employment for the ordinary citizenARNAB: Mr Prime Minister, questions are also being raised on food inflation which has still not decreased. The expectation was that the food inflation would decline. The people had put their hopes on the Prime Minister that you will bring down prices. This not only has a political impact but also has a social impact. Over the past two weeks, there were reports that in some places the price of Arhar dal had touched 150 rupees and 200 rupees for other pulses. The price of tomatoes was also rising. Is this only seasonal because the food inflation is increasing at 7.5 per cent year on year. Global oil prices have fallen. Do you think this creates perception issues for your government?PM MODI: You cant view inflation as a perception issue. Price rise should be seen as a reality. What is available for a consumer should be seen for what it is. There should never be an attempt to view price rise as a perception issue as a means of escaping the reality of price rise. We will have to accept reality. You see the fast pace at which prices were rising under the previous government, today that speed has decelerated a lot. You can see the statistics, you will find it there. Second, the country has gone through two consecutive years of severe drought. Drought has a direct impact on the price of vegetables, food and pulses because all these things are produced from the soil. Now when there is such a big drought, its not in anybodys hands. The second option in such a situation is imports. The Indian government has imported pulses in huge quantities. Third, it is the joint responsibility of the state and Central governments. It is not exclusively the states responsibility. It is not exclusively the Centres responsibility. It is the joint responsibility of both the state and Central governments. This should not be an issue of blame game that the state government did not do certain things and that the Centre did not do certain things. But it will have to be agreed that it is the joint responsibility of both. That is why the Centre has given rights to the states to make stringent laws. How much stocks to keep or not to keep are decisions which the states can take. All these rights have been given to the states. Some states have performed well, some states are trying. But the Centre and state governments are trying to work together on this. I believe that we have been successful to the extent that the speed with which prices were rising (under UPA), what would have happened if the prices were to rise at that speed. We have been successful in stopping that speedy rise of prices. But as far as pulses are concerned, production in India has been very low. Many farmers who were earlier sowing pulses have started cultivating sugar. That is also an area of concern. We gave special incentives for pulses. We have tried to set up a different MSP for pulses. We have taken steps to procure pulses from farmers with bonus. Our focus is on increasing the production of pulses. We are also focusing on building stocks of pulses by importing from abroad. An all out effort is being made and I believe that nobody doubts the sincerity of this governmentARNAB: Mr Prime Minister what is your view about the controversy around the exit of Raghuram Rajan as the RBI Governor? A lot has been spoken about this. There was commentary that it may effect Indias image, perception as a global economy. Whats your own view of the controversy around the exit of Raghuram Rajan?PM MODI: When my Government was formed in May 2014, you take newspapers from May, June, July 2014 and check television debates during that period. The topic of the television debates would be  Will the new govt let Raghuram Rajan continue? Or Will the new Government oust Raghuram Rajan? And there was more or less consensus that he was appointed by the previous govt and so Modi wont let him complete his tenure and will remove him. You have seen, that he worked his entire tenure. For the time he was appointed by the previous government, he completing his entire term. So all the misconceptions have been dispelled. Secondly, according to my 2 year experience in Govt, those who are creating controversies, are being unjust to Raghuram RajanARNAB: Why so?PM MODI: I will tell you. Those who sayI believe Raghuram Rajans patriotism is no less than any of ours. It will be doing injustice to him if one says that he will serve the country only if he is at a particular post. As much as I know Raghuram Rajan, whatever post he holds, wherever he is, he is someone who will continue to serve the country. He is someone who loves his country. Therefore, its not like the nation wont get Raghuram Rajans services, Raghuram Rajan is not that kind of a person. He is a person who loves the country. Those who speak such language are doing great injustice to him. My experience with him has been good.I appreciate the work he has done. And my good wishes will always be with himARNAB: Prime Minister Modi, theres a question related to this. During your speech at the Executive you used seven words begining with letter S Sevabhaav (service), Santulan (balance), Sanyam (restraint), Samvaad (dialogue), Samanvay (coordination), Sakaratmak (positivity) and Samvedna (sensitivity). I will ask the question in context with Raghuram Rajan because you used these words in the speech at National Executive Meet speech on June 14 in Allahabad. You said, Our party leaders and party workers should use these qualities in their daily dealings and behaviour. Prime Minister, in Raghuram Rajans context, your Rajya Sabha MP has made many comments. Later he made critical remarks against senior bureaucrats. My question is, do you think it is right? When we talk about Sanyam (restraint) and Santulan (balance), is it correct?PM MODI: Whether it is someone from my party or not, I believe that such things are inappropriate. The nation wont benefit from such publicity stunts. One should be more responsible while conducting themselves. Anyone who believes he is bigger than the system is wrong.ARNAB: Thats a very clear message.PM MODI: I have a very clear message. I have no two minds about it.ARNAB: And Mr Prime Minister, if I may say so, between May 8 and now, you are speaking as straight as you did before you took over as Prime Minister. I think that answer takes me to the next subject. Mr Prime Minister, the issue is that of Black Money. In a very interersting way you said, prices should not be looked at from the point of percepetion, equally, Mr Prime Minister it can be said said that an issue like Black Money should not be looked at in terms of perception, but it is perception forming. There are political debates on this. Experts say that the Black Money economy has shrunk, 10-15% economy has shrunk through land dealings and other things. You have passed the Black Money Bill, you have made taxation more transparent, you have started information sharing with other countries, you have taken steps, but Prime Minister Modi, people still expect that a Rs 25 lakh crores will be brought back and put into their bank accounts. How will you address that expectation? The hope that people have taking Black Money, how will you address it?PM MODI: How did the black money issue arise and how did it become such a serious issue? We have to look at the background. It is an established fact in the minds of the common man those who steal money park their money overseas. Its a common perception. Even if I look at it from the common mans perspective, I also wonder where does this money go? This issue was always stalled in the Parliament. When the matter reached the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court ordered Special Investigation Team to look into it, even then the previous government stalled it for three years, from 2011-2014. Its after this that political parties, the media and the common man started believing that theres something wrong. Then the issue of Black Money became an agenda. Even today I can saythat yes, when there is money stashed in foreign accounts, there are some norms of engagement with foreign countries on the issue. But between 2011-2014, these people were given the opportunity to launder money here and thereARNAB: And you also said on 17 February 2015 on this issue, that the then Law Minister is only offering lip servicePM MODI: The result was that people got several chances to launder money. Secondly, after our Government was formed, the first decision taken by our Cabinet was to form a Special Investigation Team to bring back Black Money which was pending despite Supreme Courts 2011 order. This shows our sincerity. From then on, you cant imagine how stringent the laws have been made to bring back Black Money and whoever comes in its fold will know how strict the law is. Thirdly, I attended the G20 Summit. Never was Black Money issue discussed in the G20 forum. It was my first G20 summit, for the first time I met the world leaders. And for the first time in the G20 Summit, one paragraph was on unaccounted money, on black money and 20 countries said that the world should cooperateBlack. The dirty money, black money was also linked to terrorism, an environment of global census was created. We have been signing agreements one after the other with different countries that there will be real time, automatic exchange of information with India. I recently visited Switzerland and there was minimal discussion on the issue. But after I returned, a big delegation from Switzerland visited India, and they held meeting with the Indian Government and we discussedfor several years, we believed that Switzerland is the place where black money is stashed, that country is holding discussions to come to a consensus on Automatic Information Exchange and if we reach consensus it will be a great achievement. Thirdly you mustve seen that Mauritius route came up in almost everything. It was said that money goes out of India and returns through the Mauritius route. This was discussed. Everyone thought that nothing can be done about the Mauritius route.But our Government held a dialogue with the Mauritius Government, made changes to the old treaty. And we successfully made a new treaty to block the money which comes through the Mauritius route and very soon it will be phased out and completed. All these decisions are taken to fight the Black Money menace. This is not a one sided fight. Secondly, the govt is working in a direction to make sure that Black Money isnt generated in India and black Money doesnt go out of India, you can see the results of all this.ARNAB: When the opposition raises the Rs 15 lakh issue.PM MODI: That is something the opposition raises during elections. Let them have some issue to talk aboutARNAB: Mr Prime Minister, there has been no major financial corruption or scam in your tenure in the last two years. Perception is again, what people say is because you keep a very tight control on the reins of Government but the question is there are people, who are wilful defaulters, the economic offenders who take a lot of money from the country or commit economic offences in the country, go overseas and use rules and use lawyers, and they dont come back to India. And people are asking now, is the Narendra Modi Govt determined to take these cases of wilful defaulters and economic offenders to their logical conclusion.PM MODI: Firstly, this question is not in the minds of people. The people of India have confidence that if theres someone who can do this, it is Narendra Modi and he will do it. Citizens of the country have full faith.ARNAB: Does it worry you, that people have misued the law?PM MODI: I take this as an opportunity and I will show them what the law is.ARNAB: Mr. Modi, there have been several corruption cases about the previous government, which have now come out. There is AgustaWestland, many defense scams and defense transactions are now being analyzed seriously. The cases which were quoted in the CAG reports but were ignored are now coming in the forefront. This question is important because this isnt just about financial corruption but these questions have direct implications on the national security of the country. Do you think, when they say that this is a political witch hunt by Narendra Modi Sarkar, do you think all of these cases would have been possible without political patronage?PM MODI: There are many things which are not visible. One cant imagine the difficulty I am experiencing in taking out things from dirt. One who is working there knows the amount of dirt that exists and how certain things have been caught in a web. There are certain powers behind it. The case about Agusta helicopters. I cant deny it and I believe that we have the right to doubt that people behind this are very experienced. They have perfectly practiced the art of doing wrong deeds. They are very experienced and knowledgeable. And one can also smell the fact that such a thing wouldnt have been done without a shield. Now, agencies are probing. Lets see how far the probe goes. But the investigation shouldnt go ahead while people are being targeted, neither does my government target anyone. The sin has been committed, but how much is done, How was it done, who did it, probe agencies will find out in a professional way. Whatever comes out, will be put outARNAB: Prime Minister, talking about your speech in the US Congress, and the humour that you displayed. I felt some of it was impromptu. But the Americans were able to relate to what you said, I dont remember the exact words, you said, I am informed that the working of the US Congress is harmonious. And then there was a pause and people were laughing. Then you said, I am told  You emphasized and said I am told that you are well known for your bipartisanship. Then the applause was more. And then you said, You are not alone. Time and again I have witnessed a similar spirit in the Indian Parliament. You spoke about a serious topic in a interesting manner. You referred to the Upper House. There was a lot of response on that too. Your humour was really appreciated and I think it was a wonderful moment when you were speaking. But, Mr. Prime Minister, when you look back at the parliament, this question comes to many peoples minds, has Prime Minister Narendra Modi being held back from achieving his own objectives because of the non-stop parliamentary logjam. How much has this affected his moving towards his own targets? If you critically analyze this situation, do you feel your government could have been more consultative or do you feel the blame is entirely with the Opposition?PM MODI: I look at it differently. I believe there have been a lot of problems. Whether the fault is ours or theirs, I ll leave it to the people. People will decide. But because of discussions in Parliament  we may not come to a decision, the decision could be opposing our view, nothing wrong in that. But at least there should be a discussion. The sad part is, if somebody is running away from debate or dont let discussions happen, then it is a cause of worry in a democracy. Whether the governments work is accomplished or not, I dont see it as a cause of worry. If not today, it will happen tomorrow. There are certain things which will happen at an administrative level. The big thing is, Parliament is for discussion. Parliament is to show dissent. Parliament is to give an argument for ones opposition, to present an argument when they support.To uphold this basic spirit of Parliament, is the responsibility of every person who values democracy. It is the responsibility of those present in the Parliament and those outside. It is the responsibility of those in power and those not in power. This is a matter of spirit and it should be followed. As far as the government is concerned, on every issue and at every forum, we have tried to hold discussions. I myself have met the opposition leaders and spoken to them. Key members of the government are also in touch. And you must have seen that many issues have been resolved. In the last session, we have passed 12 bills in Rajya Sabha, we passed 10 bills in the Lok Sabha. So the pace has picked up. When people say Opposition, it is unfair to the opposition. There are some parties in the Parliament which are not with the BJP or NDA, but are with the government on key decisions. So, to defame the Opposition by saying that all opposition parties are against us  when some people do this, it is wrong. There is one party which has problems. And the whole world knows that party. Secondly, to say that When you were is Opposition, you did it this way There is a difference between every Opposition party. We have run the government for 60 years and now we are in the Opposition, so we know the nitty-gritties of the government, we know the responsibilities. We cant behave in the way, a new Opposition party behaves. A party which hasnt been in power or hasnt seen anything, could behave in this way. For example, we are in power now, and consider in 2040 we become the Opposition party. So, in 2040 we cant have the same conduct as the one we had in 2009 or 2010.ARNAB: Congress is a very experienced and old partyPM MODI: Thats why I say that, those who have been in power for so many years, shouldnt be doing this. If there is a new party in the Opposition, they have a small demand for their state or if an MP has a demand for his/her constituency and does something like this, then we can understand. Ones who have been in power for very long, shouldnt be doing such thingsARNAB: Prime Minister Modi, do you think the GST bill which has been stuck for over one and half years, it is a path-breaking economic reform. It unifies the country. Recently you met Ms Jayalalithaa after she was sworn in as the Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee has extended her support for GST and Congress allies at the state level are supporting the GST bill. Do you feel optimistic that GST bill will be passed in the next session of the Parliament?PM MODI: First we need to understand, that we look at GST only within the purview of an economic reform because of which the right information doesnt come out. Not having GST straight away means loss for the poor of Uttar Pradesh. Absence of GST straight away means loss for the poor people of Bihar. Not passing the GST would mean loss for the poor people of poor states like Bengal, Orissa and Assam. People who sit in the Rajya Sabha must understand this. GST is beneficial for the poor people of the states represented by them, because those states will economically benefit the most from GST. The money will be used for the welfare of the poor people of those states. This is why be it Mamata Banerjee, be it Nitish Kumar, be it Akhilesh Yadav or Naveen Patnaik, all these states want the GST bill to be passed at the earliest. There is just one group which has made it the issue of prestige. Now the kind of arithmetic which is working out, I hope that this decision is passed in favour of the poor. You will be surprised to what extent has the opposition reached to the level of distortion. In the previous session we introduced an act. Indian government has Rs 40,000 crore rupees from the CAMPA Fund. Rs 40,000 crore. we wanted to give that money to the states. States have to use that money for forestry, for greenery, for planting trees and plants. The bill is meant for that. Had this Rs 40,000 crore reached the states before the monsoons, it would have been used for the forests. A lot of people would have got employment, people who plant trees would have been employed. There would be plantation and due to the rains the plants would start growing within a year. But just because of obstructionism, states have been deprived of the benefit of Rs 40,000 crore. The money was meant for the forests and for the tribals. They blocked it. There was no argument on itARNAB: The reasonyou had triedPM MODI: Made all efforts.ARNAB: You had invited former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi here at the Race Course RoadPM MODI: We held talks at every levelARNAB: Still? The word you used ego issue, why has it become an ego issue? And people would want to know why is the Prime Minister unable to end this?PM MODI: The Prime Minister cannot answer this question. Those creating obstructions can only answer this question. But despite this, I will keep trying. I am ready to convince them in which ever way possible. If I have to convoke someone over a cup of tea at their house, I am even ready for that. I have no problem. My only aim is the welfare of the poor of my country and the poor of states like Uttar Pradesh.ARNAB: You spoke of Uttar Pradesh. Mr Prime Minister, elections will be held in Uttar Pradesh in 6,7,8 months. The focus of entire nation will be on it. You are the MP from Varanasi. But some comments are made by BJP, some say Sangh Parivar, some independent groups, communal colour is added to it and not just from one party but from other parties as well. Mr Prime Minister are you going to be able to keep development as the sole agenda? The main issue in the Uttar Pradesh polls should be that of development, it shouldnt get capsized, the focus shouldnt be elsewhere. Are you confident that communal agenda will not overpower development?PM MODI: Its my conviction, its my commitment. You must have seen during the 2014 elections that I fought elections on the issue of development. The new generation of the country only believes in development. I believe that solution to all problems is in development. Development is also the solution to the tension that people talk about. If we provide employment to people, if we ensure theres food on their plates, if we provide them with facilities and give them education, all the tension will end. And this is why, all those who want good for the nation, I request them to compete towards development and for development. This atmosphere should be created in the country and I think such an environment is being created nowadays.ARNAB: So the hot heads who make extreme comments, is there a necessity to control them? So that there is no politics in the name of religionPM MODI: Firstly, I am of the firm belief that the nation should progress on the issue of development. And it is necessary that the country moves forward on the issue of development. I would like to tell the media not to make heroes out of those people who make such comments.ARNAB: But they keep making such commentsPM MODI: Dont make them heroes, they will stopARNAB: We dont make them heroes, we make them villains.PM MODI: But why do you make them so big? I see such statements by people on TV, whose faces I havent even seen and they end up becoming spokesmen on TVARNAB: Self styled spokesmenPM MODI: I dont know why such people are encouragedARNAB: Mr Prime Minister, lets talk in 2016 of the 2017 elections. After Delhi, then Bihar, then Assam, West Bengal. After that we will talk about Punjab. Before we finish talking about Punjab, we will talk about Uttar Pradesh. Then there is the Gujarat state election. Dont you think that this country is permanently stuck in an electoral cycle? The focus constantly and I want you to reflect on this issue, the focus is on party politics, polarising issues, not on governance. We are a country, if we say, we are constantly in a political campaign mode. Is this a good thing? Should we break away from it? And what is your view on it?PM MODI: See this is not an issue about Narendra Modi or the Prime Minister. And also it is not an issue about a particular party or a particular Government.But before the last Parliament session, the Speaker had called all the parties for a meal. After the agenda meeting everyone was sitting to eat. I had also reached at the same time. While talking casually over food, almost people from all parties said that the central and state elections must be held together. Everyone said it. After that during the farewell function of the Rajya Sabha MPs, people from different parties were talking with each other. One of the leaders said, Modiji do anything but get us out of this cycle of elections.ARNAB: Was that leader from your party?PM MODI: No, he was not from my party. So I said that discussion should happen. What is wrong in that? Then one day I said that this was being talked about. This issue has also been discussed in a Parliamentary committee. This work has also been started by the Election Commission and I think they have also writen a letter on it. Like in the fight against black money, this issue of elections also gets connected to black money. Electoral reforms are necessary if the country has to be rid of black money. It is one of the areas for electoral reforms. I believe that the Prime Minister cannot take a decision on this and nor should he do that. Neither the government can do this.There should be a broad discussion on this and we should not run away from the debate on this continious cycle of elections. The Indian voter today is very mature. He votes in one fashion in the Lok Sabha elections, he votes in a different manner in the State Assembly elections. We have seen this. In 2014, the General Elections conincided with the Odisha Assembly elections. The same electorate gave one judgement for Odisha and another judgement for Delhi. So this countrys voter is very mature and we should trust his maturity. There should be a debate on how costs can be reduced by holding simultaneous elections, how the influence of black money can be curbed, how the five years can be spent in taking the country forward. Today due to the model code of conduct, there is a loss even in those areas where the code is not applicable.When I was in Gujarat, I found that at least 80 to 90 officers were spending two to three months on election duties in other states. This could be happening in every state. So this is an area of concern and some time or the other this question will have to be thought of. I would want the Election Commission to take this debate forward. They should invite all political parties and hold discussions with everybody and whatever comes out of it.ARNAB: Can there be a timebound resolution in this?PM MODI: The Election Commission will have to invite all political parties to discuss this. The process will get derailed if one party were to initiate this.ARNAB: Are you willing to take the lead in building that consensus?PM MODI: Despite being the Prime Minister, I still belong to a political party. The better thing would be for the Election Commission to initiate this. Today the Election Commission is a very prestigious institution in our country. Every political party believes in the Election Commission and it will further empower this institution and that will be better.ARNAB: I think it is an interesting idea of simultaneous elections. Though state parties, regional parties may feel that it will effect them badly. That the national parties like the BJP will gain.PM MODI: Odisha is the best example. Odisha is the best example. In 2014, the BJP had no advantage in the state but the BJP won on the Lok Sabha seats. This shows the difference.ARNAB: Mr Prime Minister how are you keeping your schedule nowadays? I mean you keep a terrifying pace. The number of meetings you hold, people say your officers find it hard to keep up.PM MODI: It is not so, it has been 2 years now and everyone is used to the work. I believe that it is such a big country that one must do as much work as possible. So I keep doing that.ARNAB: Before I come to my last question Mr Prime Minister, one issue that I want to come to is the farmers crisis. As you are well aware, there has been a crisis in this country, you referred to it. In that speech to your MPs, about which I asked you earlier as well, on 20th May in the Central Hall of Parliament you said that this government is not for myself, this government is for the poor, we must do something for them. The farmers crisis Mr Prime Minster is a reality. I am glad that in this interview you have not avoided the reality, youve faced it, youve talked about it. We have linked our entire future to the monsoons. How do we overcome this from becoming an annual crisis in this country?PM MODI: We will have to put stress on water management here. You must have seen that under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayi Yojana, we have put stress on water issues. During these drought days, I met leaders from 11 states separately and sat with them for about 2-3 hours each. The country would have believed that their Prime Minister is working even if I had held a meeting with 11 of them together for around 10 minutes. But I didnt do that. I sat with leaders from different states separately to understand specific problems and what we could do for water in those states. I am happy, whichever party the state government affiliated to, all the governments focused a lot on water issues this summer.We will reap its benefits this monsoon. Using scientific methods for water accumulation and irrigation, collecting water and directing them towards the fields, everyone did that. Micro irrigation is stressed upon. Even for sugarcane farming, farmers are slowly moving towards micro irrigation which earlier happened through flood irrigation. Paddy crops for which large amount of water is used. Today, farmers have started using drip irrigation for it. If we do well in water facilities, then one of the problems is solved. After independence, for the first time, we have brought in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana which can cover maximum number of farmers. The farmer will have to pay only 2%, only 2%, the government will take care of the rest. The farmers will get an assurance. For instance, in Maharashtra, the monsoons are expected in the month of June, the farmers have prepared for everything but havent started with the sowing process. Now if there are no rains till August, so practically his crops have not been damaged, because he did not sow the seeds.But the Pradhan Mantri fasal Beema Yojana even takes this into consideration and benefits the farmer. Another important aspect, once the crops are harvested, theyre cut and kept in the field, assuming it has been a good year for crop growth, with 100% crop production, but it hasnt been loaded on trucks and sent to the market yet. And if it rains, even after 15 days of harvesting, if there is loss, it is covered under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana. Second layer of protection, minimum premium with maximum cover. After independence, for the first time, we have brought in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana. Thirdly, first time we have brought in E-Mandi concept. Farmer in the village, can sell the crops to the best markets in the country through his mobile phone. Farmer would set the price at which the crop would be sold. Earlier, farmers used to take the produce on carts or tractors, used to go to a mandi 20-25kms away, then due to storage issues, even if they had to sell for Rs 10 less than the price, they used to sell it. Now, sitting at home the farmer would know what price to sell the crops at. Next point is about, food processing, value addition. We opened up 100% foreign direct investment in food processing.For example, if a farmer is selling tomatoes and if a company is processing tomato ketchup then my farmers would benefit from it. The companies that make aerated drinks, Coca-Cola, Pepsi etc, I requested them to add 5% natural fruit juice. In regions near Nagpur and Vidarbha where oranges are cultivated, Coca-Cola is going to add 5% of orange juice. If we add 5% natural juice to aerated water, farmers would get their market and their fruits wouldnt go waste. We should have a comprehensive all-out scheme. So much of our land has been damaged. We have brought in Soil Health Card. We have a Soil Health Abhiyan. The farmer will know the fertility of the land through it. Whether a fertilizer needs to be used or not, the farmer will understand. On an average, a farmer with 1 hectare of land will be able to save Rs 15000-20000. So we have brought in scientific methods. You would know that in our country, farmers used to be lathicharged when they would go to buy urea and they had to buy it in black. We got urea 100% neem coated. Earlier, urea used to go to chemical factories, and the government subsidies were stolen in the name of farmers. After neem coating, urea cannot be used for any other purpose except farming.Because of neem coating, there is a qualitative change which helps in healing the damaged land. Due to neem coating a piece of land that used 10 kgs of urea can now manage with 7 kgs of urea. All these initiatives are in the direction of agriculture and the resuARNAB: Do you think that the farmers crisis will be resolved, the question I asked, that it wont be an annual affair, the dependence on monsoons will go down?PM MODI: See agriculture is a state subject. The Indian government has taken initiatives, if the state government are enthusiastic to implement this, which I think they will be. As I told you I met leaders from different states and they worked a lot for water issues. If this works, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana has direct involvement of the central government, it will have great benefits.ARNAB: Mr Prime Minister now I have two questions for you.PM MODI: This has become too long.ARNAB: Ill club these two (questions) together. Youre also enjoying it and I am glad youre speaking Mr Prime Minister because there is so much ground to cover and I think viewers would like to hear your view, sir. Actually there are three, if you allow me. Theyre short questions. First is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, how much is politics playing on your mind? In the sense that every Prime Minister, especially someone who is as forthright as you, looks at the next big challenge. Is 2019 anywhere in your mind?PM MODI: Those who have seen me in Gujarat, and those who have seen me in the last two years, those who see me without any bias, they will know that I am an apolitical Prime Minister. Apart from elections, I dont get involved into politics ever. You can call elections a necessity, a restraint or a responsibility, we have to do it. I attend many functions, go to different areas, you wouldnt have heard any political comment from me. If I go to a government function, I talk about government related topics. If I attend a Railways function I talk about railways, if water then water, if water bodies, then water bodies. My focus is on governance. Country has been at greatest loss because governments were run only for elections. Governments must not run only for elections. The government should be a bona fide attempt of meeting the demands and expectations of the common people. Elections should just be a bi-product. It is a democracy. Winning and losing is a part of it. It shouldnt be hyped. You would have seen recently I urged everyone to pay taxes before 30th September. I even said it on Mann Ki Baat yesterday. Will a person, who is only concerned with winning elections, say that post 30th September youd face problems?ARNAB: This was also a warning in a way.PM MODI: It is a warning. It is definitely a warning. It is a warning. My first warning is to my government officers to not presume citizens as thieves. I have already given this warning. I have handled my officers first. It took me quite some time. You will be shocked to hear that I have given an early retirement to more than 30 people from Income Tax Department on integrity issues. This isnt a small issue. People who werent transferred since 20 years, I got them transferred. So, one, my focus is on my system. Second, I also tell the country, that for the poor of the nation we would have to give out something for the poor in our country. It is my responsibility to give the people an account of every rupee. I will use it at right places. I wont let it get stolen. But if I need to give houses to the poor, we would need revenue. I dont want to increase taxes, I just want taxes to be paid honestly. There is no need to increase the taxes. The country can run without troubling the citizens. I am working towards it. That is why I have given the citizens a chance to pay the taxes till 30th September, whatever it is Rs 10,000 or Rs. 50,000. If they think they want to come into mainstream, they must and shouldnt be worried. After 30th September, the government will have to take steps. I will not worry about the polls. I will take the necessary steps. I want to work for the poor in my country.ARNAB: Mister Prime Minister, do some crystal ball gazing for the next three years. For the next three years, to use the cricketing analogy, how do you find your run rate so far and will you have to score at a higher run rate in the next three years to achieve your targets?PM MODI: See, no matte at what speed I move forward, I am never satisfied. If today I run at a speed of 100, I keep an aim of running at 200. I think that the world that was behind us, has gone ahead. We need to run a lot to match that level. So we do not need to calculate. We just need to give it all in. And I have given myself in completely. Ive been successful is pulling my entire government in. I believe that the country is also committed to move forwardARNAB: Final question to you Mr Prime Minister, what motivates you the most? First of all as I said, will you be able to keep this pace? What motivates you the most and also if you can share with our viewers honestly what is your one greatest source of worry?PM MODI: Firstly, I dont live under the burden of worries. Problems and challenges are there, you cant deny that. But you must challenge the challenges and not let the challenges turn into worries. This is my principle. I challenge the challenges. I like to face the problems. I dont run away from them. Whatever loss I have to face for it, I face it. But I cant leave the country helpless. This responsibility must be taken and I will continue to do so. For all good and bad things, it is my responsibility. I do not regret anything. I believe, people of the country have given me the responsibility and I must fulfill it. Thirdly, when I see the poor in our country, it reminds me of the work that I have to do for them. Day before yesterday, I was in Pune, and met a Shrimaan Chandrakant ji. A retired teacher with a pension of Rs 16000, donates Rs 5000 every month for Swachh Abhiyaan. If a 70 year old retired teacher with children and family at home, without worrying about them, worries about the country, then being the Prime Minister, I should work a thousand times more than Chandrakant ji. This is my inspiration. People of this country who work day and night, they are my inspiration. I look at them and I work even harder.ARNAB: Prime Minister Narendra Modi it has been a privilege. I am grateful for this interview.PM MODI: Thank youARNAB: And thank you on behalf of all our viewers that you spoke frankly. The program is Frankly Speaking and I am thankful to you that you were so frank.PM MODI: I just request you to not create controversies out of this but instead use it for the benefit of the country.ARNAB: Please do not think like that. Thank you very muchPM MODI: Thanks a lot. Thank you very much.ARNAB: Thank you very much.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd","prime minister narendra modi in an interview with times now has shared his views on a range of issues. here is the complete transcript of the prime ministers interview with arnab goswami.arnab: prime minister modi thank you very much for this interview. thank you very muchpm modi: my greetings to all the peoplearnab: this is your first one to one interview to a private news channel since you became prime minister. and if i am not mistaken, this is the first ever interview by a sitting prime minister of india to a private television news channel in the country. so i would first like to thank you and am very grateful for the opportunity.pm modi: the world of the media has grown so big that everybody has to attach themselves with it.watch video: whats making newsarnab: i am very grateful and our viewers will be very grateful also mr modi because they want to hear your views on a range of subjects. mr prime minister i would like to start by taking you back to 20th may 2014. the results came on may 16th. four days later, you gave a historic speech in the central hall of parliament and you were speaking to the members of parliament. you had said four days after the results that an era of responsibility has begun. and that you said that in 2019 before the elections, i will come back to this parliament, i will come back to the mps and i will give my report card. forty percent into your tenure, how much have you achieved of your own targets?pm modi: when i went for the first time as an mp to the central hall, and it was the first time i was seeing the central hall. i had not been there before. so i had then said that becoming the prime minister was not about the designation of the office but it was about the responsibilities and work of being a pm. i had also said that my government would be committed to the poor. i was completely new in the job. delhi was new for me. the delhi environment was new to me. the work of the government of india was also new for me. but despite that, in such a short time, the pace at which the country has moved forward, and its not on one subject. you can pick up any aspect of the governments functioning, and if you make a comparison with the past governments, then you will realize that no issue has been ignored. there has been an effort to bring in something new in every area. there is an effort to bring in change in every area. one big challenge was that i was not experienced about this place, i had not even been an mp. the office was new, the questions were also new. but when i look at the second biggest challenge, we should remember those days when the country was engulfed in disappointment. the everyday news was about whether there would be any electricity production after seven days, whether coal would be supplied or not. this was the situation then. the entire system was engulfed in disappointment. the big challenge was to inject new trust into the system and create confidence among the citizens. it is very difficult to evaluate this from the outside but i have gone through it. but today i can say with a lot of satisfaction that now there is no trace of any disappointment. the intention to do something is visible. and its not in words but in actual achievement. i had said that within a given timeframe, we will open bank accounts for the poor. for something that had not been done for 60 years, setting a timeframe for it was in itself a risk. but because of that a trust was created in the system that it was something doable. so thats the process i started for awakening the confidence. and today you can see that in every sector, the changed circumstances can be seen. while evaluating the performance of this government, never forget that you will have to make that evaluation in comparison with the 10 years of the previous government. only then will you know where we were and where we are now. we should not be talking about what we are aiming for. for now you will have to assess the present in comparison with the immediate past and in that you will find a bright future.arnab: mr. modi, i want to start now on the issue of foreign policy. in the area of foreign policy, you have taken great personal interest. the amount of personal interest you have shown in foreign policy, probably none of the previous prime ministers showed the same kind of interest. your approach is pro active. what i find interesting about your foreign policy is that you have balanced different powers and different interests. on the one side, your relationship with us, you made sure that india enters the missile control technology regime with them. a week before that you also signed the historic chabahar port agreement with iran. so, you have balanced very diverse forces. my question to you over this is that, is it easy to do that as an indian prime minister? secondly, on the issue of the nsg, you staked a lot of personal interest, personal push, you lobbied actively. how close are we to getting the nsg seat?pm modi: firstly, about foreign policy, you need to know what has strengthened our foreign policy. for 30 years, in our country, the government was unstable. for 30 years, party with a clear mandate wasnt given the opportunity to form the government. the world measures the government of a nation on the basis of its condition in its own country, on how strong their word is in their own country. i am thankful to the people of this country, that after 30 years, they chose a government with absolute majority and this has had an impact on world politics. countries and world leaders have changed their perspective towards india. this is the biggest benefit. secondly, the world didnt know me. the world wants to know who the head of the state is. if someone would want to know modi through the eyes of the media, then he would be disillusioned on which modi is the real modi. if this happens, the country will be at a loss. modis personality shouldnt be a hindrance for the world to have faith in india. but for that unless i meet all those leaders and engage them them one to one, unless i speak to them frankly, they wouldnt know about indias head of state, so it was very important for me as i am not from a political family. i never had the opportunity to meet the world leaders earlier.arnab: you were an unknown entity in foreign policypm modi: more than foreign policy it was foreign relations. yes, i was new to it. so for me, being pro active was mandatory. thirdly, we work as a team. foreign ministry, prime ministers officer, commerce ministry, finance ministry, defense minister, everyone works as a team, not as separate pieces. the impact that is now visible, is not just because of modi, it is because of the team. all teams work in a particular direction. that is why the impact is seen, earlier these teams were splintered. we have seen instances where the party would give a statement, the prime minister would say something else, party leaders would say something else. this disunity has had a negative impact. thirdly, we also need to understand that earlier the world was bi polar. foreign policy would be centered around two super powers. india was a little late in realizing that this bi polar situation was for namesake. now the entire world, in changed circumstances, especially in 21st century, it is more interdependent and inter connected, earlier, the foreign policy was possible between governments, but today it is not possible just between governments. government relations are important but increasing people to people contact is equally important. theres been a shift in paradigm. because i do not have any previous baggage, because ive had a clean slate, i write everything from beginning and that has a benefit. today we are building relations with countries across the world. the amount of respect with which i engage saudi arabia, i engage iran with the same amount of respect. the amount of respect with which i speak to america, i speak to russia with the same amount of respect. so we need to understand this. we also need to understand that we shouldnt consider smaller countries insignificant. i abide by this principle. the small countries of the world are as important as the big nations. we had assumed that the relations with smaller nations would develop under the shadow of the bigger nations. i brought about a change in this. you must have seen that i made a forum for the pacific island nations. we have had two meetings. i went there once and they came here once. these are small countries with a population of about 10 lakh or 20 lakh. but these small island nations are most affected by global warming. when india took up the international solar mission and 122 nations joined it, the island nations benefitted the most out of it. they are 50 in number now. a group of 50 nations, feels secured with this vision of india. if we try to understand this change, then we would realize that in the world, a few days back, i was sitting with the officers of our foreign services, so as we got talking, in a very poetic way i told them that there was a time when we used to sit by the sea and count the waves, but the time has now changed, we are done counting waves, now its time for us to steer ourselves, ride the waves and decide on our direction, destination and speed.arnab: that is apparent. you have a very aggressive foreign policy. but my second question was, you put so much effort for nsg membership. my question was, how close are we to nsg membership and were you disappointed that we did not make it at the very end because of chinas opposition?pm modi: look the first thing is that india has been continuously making these efforts, no matter which government was in office. be it the membership of the un security council or the sco membership or mtcr membership or nsg membership. every government has made an effort. its not that only this government is trying, its in continuity. but its during our tenure that we achieved sco membership, we also got the mtcr membership. i have full faith that now we have begun a coordinated effort for the nsg membership too. the process has begun on a positive note. everything has rules and will work accordingly and move forwardarnab: is it the problem of mindset with china? there have been 13 engagements at various levels between the narendra modi government and the chinese government. the latest engagement was when you went to tashkent. you spent some time with the chinese president xi jinping. yet it was seen that in the case of masood azhar, china blocked indias un bid to ban him. now they have stalled indias nsg bid. why is china repeatedly blocking us mr prime minister despite your personal proactive measures and your governments outreach?pm modi: the first thing is that we have an ongoing dialogue with china and it should continue to happen. in foreign policy its not necessary to have similar views to have a conversation. even when the views are contradictory, talks are the only way forward and problems should be resolved through dialogue. we dont have one problem with china, we have a whole lot of problems pending with china. slowly and steadily, an effort is on to address these issues through talks and make them less cumbersome. i can say that china has been cooperating with india to search for solutions. on some issues, its a question of principles for them. on some issues, its a question of principles for us. on some issues they differ with us and there are issues on which we differ with them. there are some basic differences. but the most important thing is that we can speak to china eye-to-eye and put forth indias interests in the most unambiguous manner. we are a government that takes care of indias interests. we dont compromise on this. three days ago i met the chinese president. i told him clearly about indias interests. they are a different country, we are a different countryarnab: do you think you will be able to change their mindset on the issue of nsg membership?pm modi: see the foreign policy is not about changing mindsets. foreign policy is about finding the common meeting points. where do our interests converge and how much? we have to sit and talk with every country. its our ongoing effortarnab: this statement that you just made is also apt in the context of america where you gave a speech in the u.s congress. by the way mr prime minister it was a fantastic speechpm modi: thank youarnab: there was a lot of humour. you were laughing and cracking jokes while you delivered the speech which was very unique. they also appreciated it. was the speech impromptu?pm modi: i have a humourous side but these days humour can be a risky thingarnab: why do you say that?pm modi: in this era of 24/7 news channels, anybody can lift a small word and make a big issue out of it. but i will tell you the truth, the reason for the absence of humour in public life is this fear. i am myself scared . earlier when i used to make speeches, i would make it so humourous but there would never be any issuesarnab: have you become more conscious now?pm modi: i am not conscious. i am in fear, there is no humour left in public life because of this fear. everyone is scared. i am in fear. my speeches used be humourous. i see it in parliament, that humour is finished there too. it is a matter of concern. i will quote one proverb.arnab: yes, go ahead.pm modi: even if you mention a proverb, they will connect it with something else and begin a conversation. the one who is saying the proverb does not know for what he is speaking.arnab: but you should not lose your sense of humour mr prime ministerpm modi: but it is true that my trip to the united states of america, my speech in their congress and the respect shown towards india created a lot of hype. had it not been hyped so much, there would not have been so much criticism on the nsg issue. government is being criticized not for any mishandling of the nsg issue but because we were so successful over there (in the usa)arnab: did china become conscious of your growing friendship with us?pm modi: i am talking about whats happening herearnab: but when you delivered that speech in context of america, you used a very interesting phrase. you said we have to overcome the hesitations of history. my hindi is not that good. like hesitations of history. but my question to you is mr prime minister, how close can we get to america because many indians believe that america is still supporting pakistan, giving them military assistance. how close can we get? at what point do we stop before we are seen like an american ally? what is your own world view on that?pm modi: i would especially like to appeal to my countrys media that we should stop looking at everything in india from the . india is an independent country. it is a country of 125 crore people. whenever it approaches any country, it will only be concerned about its own interests. it has been our biggest shortcoming and mistake that we have been tagging ourselves with another country and trying to do things. we are an independent country, we have our own policies and future. we have to think about the future of our 125 crore people. there should be no compromise on our interests. we have relations with america in the context of these fundamental pointsarnab: how close can we get to them?pm modi: there has been warmth in our relationship. you must have seen the editorials in american newspapers after my visit to that country. one point mentioned in those editorials was that the success of obamas foreign policy has been the warm relationship with india. this has been saidarnab: what you are saying modiji is that we can be close to america but we need not be an ally or seen to be an ally?pm modi: the first thing is that we no longer live in a bipolar world. the world is interconnected and interdependent. you will have to connect with everybody at the same time. even if there are two opposing countries, they will have to be friends. now the times have changedarnab: mr modi, on 8th may 2014, i had the opportunity to interview you, the interview took place in ahmedabad, i think one last phase of elections was left. we were discussing the issue of pakistan. you have had an uncompromising approach towards pakistan. two days back, lashkar e toiba killed 8 crpf jawans in an attack. in the 8th may interview, you put forth a very interesting phrase, you said can talks be heard amidst the noise of bombs, guns and pistols? this is how you had phrased it. do you believe we have been too generous towards pakistan? do you believe we have been too generous towards pakistan?pm modi: there are two things. one  india has always wanted friendly ties with its neighbours, there can be no debate around it. we want to live in harmony and peace. and i have said it repeatedly, that india has to fight poverty, pakistan too has to fight poverty, why dont we come together to fight poverty? i said this before elections and during election campaigns. also i had invited leaders of saarc nations to my swearing in ceremony and they had attended it as well. so there has been no change in our intent, our thoughts and our current behaviour. number two  those who have to work from the table, will work from the table and those who have to work at the border, will work at border with full strength. each one will fulfill the responsibility entrusted to them. and our jawans are fulfilling their responsibilities. its true that pressure on terrorists has increased, their schemes are proving unsuccessful. the intent with which they move forward are foiled and they have to face major challenges. it is because of this disappointment that such incidents are taking place and our jawans are risking their lives and protecting the country. we are very proud of our jawansarnab: when your foreign policy is studied, observers analyze whats happening and whats not happening. if you give me the opportunity, i want to do a bit of analyses. there was a terrific pace of engagement with pakistan between october, november and december. on 30th november, you met nawaz sharif on the sidelines (of un climate summit in paris). both of you were seated on a sofa, talking to each other. a lot of people were speculating the contents of your conversation. this was on the sidelines of climate summit. after that, all of a sudden within seven days there were nsa level talks and ajit doval spoke to nasir janjua in bangkok. and again after that you went to russia via afghanistan, you made an unexpected visit to nawaz sharif in lahore. it was a personal trip but it still had some level of importance. eight days later, pakistani terrorists attacked pathankot. can you tell our viewers whether pakistan was proactively responding in the months of october, november and december? did the pathankot terror attack change the situation? is it true that pakistan was making a lot of movement in those three months?pm modi: look there are different types of forces operating in pakistan. but the government only engages with a democratically elected system. our effort for that engagement is continuing. but our supreme objective is peace. our supreme objective is to protect indias interests. we keep making effort toward that objective and sometimes our efforts are successful. as far as meetings and talks are concerned, we signalled right from the day i took oath and sent invitations for the oath taking ceremony, that we seek friendly relations but without compromising on our interests. and that is why i have said that my countrys soldiers have full freedom to answer back in whatever manner they have to and they will keep doing thatarnab: mr prime minister what is the lakshman rekha that you would draw when it comes to pakistan. there is some confusion surrounding this subject. i would like you to give an elaborate reply. in 2014, it was believed that if talks are being held, then they should be held between two countries and not with hurriyat. it should be between the government of india and the government of pakistan. the other lakshman rekha is that you must act on 26/11. theres been no forward movement so far. the third thing is about forward movement on the pathankot attack case. so what is the lakshman rekha now and if pakistan remains within those bounds, so talks can happen at the political level or at any other level?pm modi: the first thing is that with pakistan, to whom do we talk to decide about the lakshman rekha. will it be with the elected government or with other actors? that is why india will have to be on alert all the time. india will have to be alert every moment. there can never be any laxity in this. but there is an outcome due to my continuous efforts like my visit to lahore and my invitation to the pakistani prime minister to come to india. now i dont have to explain to the world about indias position. the world is unanimously appreciating indias position. and the world is seeing that pakistan is finding it difficult to respond. if we had become an obstacle, then we would have had to explain to the world that we are not that obstacle. now we dont have to explain to the world. the world knows our intentions. like on the issue of terrorism, the world never bought indias theory on terrorism. they would sometime dismiss it by saying that its your law and order problem. today the world has to accept what india has been saying about terrorism. indias dialogue on terrorism, the losses india has suffered due to terrorism, the losses suffered by humanity, the world is now acknowledging that. so i believe we have to take this process forwardarnab: mr prime minister i now want to move to questions on the economy. in the past two years you have started many schemes. if we look at the theme of jan dhan yojna for financial inclusion, pradhan mantri fasal bima yojna for crop insurance, swach bharat, skill india, make in india. if we see the theme running through these schemes, is your social agenda at the core of your personal economic philosophy, social transformation? is the social agenda at the core of your economic philosophy as the prime minister?pm modi: the first point is our philosophy is to reach the last man in the line. pandit deendayal upadhyays philosophy forms the core of our political, economic and social ideology. and even mahatma gandhi used to say that what is there for the last man? so my development parameter is very simple. it is about how the poorest of the poor can benefit from development. the poor is the central focus of my economic agenda. the poor should be strengthened in such a way that they get the willingness to defeat poverty. by helping the poor make ends meet while they remain in poverty is also one of the ways. i am not saying right or wrong but its one of the ways. but today the countrys situation is such that we should make the poor strong so that they become partners in defeating poverty. all these schemes are meant to empower the poor and change the quality of life. the pradhan mantri jan dhan yojna is not only about opening bank accounts for the poor. because of this the poor are feeling that they are becoming a part of the countrys economic system. the bank that he was seeing from afar, now he is able to enter that bank. this brings about a psychological transformation. looked at in another way, did you ever imagine that 40 thousand crores could be injected into the banking system by contributions from the poor. the poor who never had bank accounts, have deposited 100 rupees, 50 rupees or 200 rupees. it means that poor man saved 100 rupees and the change began in his life. we have taken up construction of toilets. i had gone to chhattisgarh and had the opportunity to get the blessings of one mother. an adivasi mother heard about the scheme for building toilets. she sold her four goats and built a toilet. that 90 old mother uses a walking stick and goes around the cluster of 30 or 40 houses in the tribal village and has been spreading the message to build toilets. this change is becoming the reason for the change in the quality of life. i have begun the cleanliness campaign. its estimated an individual spends an average of 7000 rupees for treatment of a disease. the main reason for disease is filth. the poor suffer the most from the filth. if a poor man falls sick, he cannot drive his rickshaw for two days and his children go hungry. so how can we help the poor bring about change in their lives? now there is a neo-middle class and a middle class in the country. the young have their aspirations. so another aspect of my policies you must have seen are the start up india, stand up india, seaport activity, port activity, railways expansion, railway station upgradation. these changes directly appeal to the middle class. the middle class has its aspirations. we have to create jobs? how will job creation happen? till i invest in the development of infrastructure, there be no job creation. you must have seen that the maximum electricity generation since independence has occurred this year. the maximum amount of coal mined has been in this year. the maximum length of roads being constructed daily is happening in this year. the fastest loading and unloading of steamers at sea ports is happening now. all these changes are creating opportunities for employment like in start up india, stand up india. for instance in stand up india, i have said that every bank should give an economic opportunity to one woman, one dalit or one tribal person to become entrepreneurs. this will create many job opportunities. so this is the basis of my economic philosophy.arnab: mr prime minister if i could interrupt you on this. on the one hand is the peoples expectations and on the other is your vision. many programs that you have mentioned, you cant put a calendar date to it but they dont have an immediate impact. they maybe able to show results in 3, 4, 5 maybe beyond 5 years. now there are challenges in that. mr prime minister, you are aware more than anyone else that people want immediate results. now you spoke of job creation. the first thing, as an achievement you have managed to grow the economy at 7.5 per cent when the global economic climate is very bleak. you have spoken about it as well. you have met fiscal deficit targets, fdi inflows have increased but people are saying that job opportunities are not increasing. you have spoken about infrastructure but the current rate of unemployment. mr prime minister, the latest labour bureau figures, is it a source of concern for you as the prime minister?pm modi: the first thing is that are 800 million people below the age of 35 in our country. we have to accept that the demand for jobs is very high. but where will they get employment? investment will come in. it will be used in the infrastructure sector, manufacturing and services sector. now like the initiative we have taken, we have started the mudra yojna. more than three crore people in the country comprise washermen, barbers, milkman, newspaper vendors, cart vendors. we have given them nearly 1.25 lakh crore rupees without any guarantee. now why have these people taken the money? to expand their work. when he expands his work, if he is currently employing one person, now he has to employ two people. if there were two employed earlier, now there are three. now just think, when 3 crore of these small businesses have got access to finance, they must have expanded their work. now all this is not in the labour departments registration. three crore people have expanded their work. we took another small decision. the big malls in the country run 365 days a year but the smaller shops have to close on holidays. we announced in the budget that even a small shopkeeper can operate his shop till late night and that too on all the seven days of the week. if the malls dont have restrictions then why should the small shopkeepers have restrictions. so now if a shopkeeper operates his shop till late and on all seven days, if he earlier employed one person, now he will have to employ two people. so wont the employment increase?arnab: so is your focus on entrepreneurship?pm modi: our focus is on all aspects. now we are saying that by 2022 we want to ensure that everyone has a house. housing sector has the maximum potential for creating employment. houses will be built in such huge numbers, how many people will get employment? you must have seen that last year we brought in a textile policy. under this textile policy, there will be income tax benefits for those who create employment. the more employment one creates, the more tax benefits they will get. for the first time, employment generation and tax has been linked. these are the things that boost employment and our central focus is creating employment for the ordinary citizenarnab: mr prime minister, questions are also being raised on food inflation which has still not decreased. the expectation was that the food inflation would decline. the people had put their hopes on the prime minister that you will bring down prices. this not only has a political impact but also has a social impact. over the past two weeks, there were reports that in some places the price of arhar dal had touched 150 rupees and 200 rupees for other pulses. the price of tomatoes was also rising. is this only seasonal because the food inflation is increasing at 7.5 per cent year on year. global oil prices have fallen. do you think this creates perception issues for your government?pm modi: you cant view inflation as a perception issue. price rise should be seen as a reality. what is available for a consumer should be seen for what it is. there should never be an attempt to view price rise as a perception issue as a means of escaping the reality of price rise. we will have to accept reality. you see the fast pace at which prices were rising under the previous government, today that speed has decelerated a lot. you can see the statistics, you will find it there. second, the country has gone through two consecutive years of severe drought. drought has a direct impact on the price of vegetables, food and pulses because all these things are produced from the soil. now when there is such a big drought, its not in anybodys hands. the second option in such a situation is imports. the indian government has imported pulses in huge quantities. third, it is the joint responsibility of the state and central governments. it is not exclusively the states responsibility. it is not exclusively the centres responsibility. it is the joint responsibility of both the state and central governments. this should not be an issue of blame game that the state government did not do certain things and that the centre did not do certain things. but it will have to be agreed that it is the joint responsibility of both. that is why the centre has given rights to the states to make stringent laws. how much stocks to keep or not to keep are decisions which the states can take. all these rights have been given to the states. some states have performed well, some states are trying. but the centre and state governments are trying to work together on this. i believe that we have been successful to the extent that the speed with which prices were rising (under upa), what would have happened if the prices were to rise at that speed. we have been successful in stopping that speedy rise of prices. but as far as pulses are concerned, production in india has been very low. many farmers who were earlier sowing pulses have started cultivating sugar. that is also an area of concern. we gave special incentives for pulses. we have tried to set up a different msp for pulses. we have taken steps to procure pulses from farmers with bonus. our focus is on increasing the production of pulses. we are also focusing on building stocks of pulses by importing from abroad. an all out effort is being made and i believe that nobody doubts the sincerity of this governmentarnab: mr prime minister what is your view about the controversy around the exit of raghuram rajan as the rbi governor? a lot has been spoken about this. there was commentary that it may effect indias image, perception as a global economy. whats your own view of the controversy around the exit of raghuram rajan?pm modi: when my government was formed in may 2014, you take newspapers from may, june, july 2014 and check television debates during that period. the topic of the television debates would be  will the new govt let raghuram rajan continue? or will the new government oust raghuram rajan? and there was more or less consensus that he was appointed by the previous govt and so modi wont let him complete his tenure and will remove him. you have seen, that he worked his entire tenure. for the time he was appointed by the previous government, he completing his entire term. so all the misconceptions have been dispelled. secondly, according to my 2 year experience in govt, those who are creating controversies, are being unjust to raghuram rajanarnab: why so?pm modi: i will tell you. those who sayi believe raghuram rajans patriotism is no less than any of ours. it will be doing injustice to him if one says that he will serve the country only if he is at a particular post. as much as i know raghuram rajan, whatever post he holds, wherever he is, he is someone who will continue to serve the country. he is someone who loves his country. therefore, its not like the nation wont get raghuram rajans services, raghuram rajan is not that kind of a person. he is a person who loves the country. those who speak such language are doing great injustice to him. my experience with him has been good.i appreciate the work he has done. and my good wishes will always be with himarnab: prime minister modi, theres a question related to this. during your speech at the executive you used seven words begining with letter s sevabhaav (service), santulan (balance), sanyam (restraint), samvaad (dialogue), samanvay (coordination), sakaratmak (positivity) and samvedna (sensitivity). i will ask the question in context with raghuram rajan because you used these words in the speech at national executive meet speech on june 14 in allahabad. you said, our party leaders and party workers should use these qualities in their daily dealings and behaviour. prime minister, in raghuram rajans context, your rajya sabha mp has made many comments. later he made critical remarks against senior bureaucrats. my question is, do you think it is right? when we talk about sanyam (restraint) and santulan (balance), is it correct?pm modi: whether it is someone from my party or not, i believe that such things are inappropriate. the nation wont benefit from such publicity stunts. one should be more responsible while conducting themselves. anyone who believes he is bigger than the system is wrong.arnab: thats a very clear message.pm modi: i have a very clear message. i have no two minds about it.arnab: and mr prime minister, if i may say so, between may 8 and now, you are speaking as straight as you did before you took over as prime minister. i think that answer takes me to the next subject. mr prime minister, the issue is that of black money. in a very interersting way you said, prices should not be looked at from the point of percepetion, equally, mr prime minister it can be said said that an issue like black money should not be looked at in terms of perception, but it is perception forming. there are political debates on this. experts say that the black money economy has shrunk, 10-15% economy has shrunk through land dealings and other things. you have passed the black money bill, you have made taxation more transparent, you have started information sharing with other countries, you have taken steps, but prime minister modi, people still expect that a rs 25 lakh crores will be brought back and put into their bank accounts. how will you address that expectation? the hope that people have taking black money, how will you address it?pm modi: how did the black money issue arise and how did it become such a serious issue? we have to look at the background. it is an established fact in the minds of the common man those who steal money park their money overseas. its a common perception. even if i look at it from the common mans perspective, i also wonder where does this money go? this issue was always stalled in the parliament. when the matter reached the supreme court, the supreme court ordered special investigation team to look into it, even then the previous government stalled it for three years, from 2011-2014. its after this that political parties, the media and the common man started believing that theres something wrong. then the issue of black money became an agenda. even today i can saythat yes, when there is money stashed in foreign accounts, there are some norms of engagement with foreign countries on the issue. but between 2011-2014, these people were given the opportunity to launder money here and therearnab: and you also said on 17 february 2015 on this issue, that the then law minister is only offering lip servicepm modi: the result was that people got several chances to launder money. secondly, after our government was formed, the first decision taken by our cabinet was to form a special investigation team to bring back black money which was pending despite supreme courts 2011 order. this shows our sincerity. from then on, you cant imagine how stringent the laws have been made to bring back black money and whoever comes in its fold will know how strict the law is. thirdly, i attended the g20 summit. never was black money issue discussed in the g20 forum. it was my first g20 summit, for the first time i met the world leaders. and for the first time in the g20 summit, one paragraph was on unaccounted money, on black money and 20 countries said that the world should cooperateblack. the dirty money, black money was also linked to terrorism, an environment of global census was created. we have been signing agreements one after the other with different countries that there will be real time, automatic exchange of information with india. i recently visited switzerland and there was minimal discussion on the issue. but after i returned, a big delegation from switzerland visited india, and they held meeting with the indian government and we discussedfor several years, we believed that switzerland is the place where black money is stashed, that country is holding discussions to come to a consensus on automatic information exchange and if we reach consensus it will be a great achievement. thirdly you mustve seen that mauritius route came up in almost everything. it was said that money goes out of india and returns through the mauritius route. this was discussed. everyone thought that nothing can be done about the mauritius route.but our government held a dialogue with the mauritius government, made changes to the old treaty. and we successfully made a new treaty to block the money which comes through the mauritius route and very soon it will be phased out and completed. all these decisions are taken to fight the black money menace. this is not a one sided fight. secondly, the govt is working in a direction to make sure that black money isnt generated in india and black money doesnt go out of india, you can see the results of all this.arnab: when the opposition raises the rs 15 lakh issue.pm modi: that is something the opposition raises during elections. let them have some issue to talk aboutarnab: mr prime minister, there has been no major financial corruption or scam in your tenure in the last two years. perception is again, what people say is because you keep a very tight control on the reins of government but the question is there are people, who are wilful defaulters, the economic offenders who take a lot of money from the country or commit economic offences in the country, go overseas and use rules and use lawyers, and they dont come back to india. and people are asking now, is the narendra modi govt determined to take these cases of wilful defaulters and economic offenders to their logical conclusion.pm modi: firstly, this question is not in the minds of people. the people of india have confidence that if theres someone who can do this, it is narendra modi and he will do it. citizens of the country have full faith.arnab: does it worry you, that people have misued the law?pm modi: i take this as an opportunity and i will show them what the law is.arnab: mr. modi, there have been several corruption cases about the previous government, which have now come out. there is agustawestland, many defense scams and defense transactions are now being analyzed seriously. the cases which were quoted in the cag reports but were ignored are now coming in the forefront. this question is important because this isnt just about financial corruption but these questions have direct implications on the national security of the country. do you think, when they say that this is a political witch hunt by narendra modi sarkar, do you think all of these cases would have been possible without political patronage?pm modi: there are many things which are not visible. one cant imagine the difficulty i am experiencing in taking out things from dirt. one who is working there knows the amount of dirt that exists and how certain things have been caught in a web. there are certain powers behind it. the case about agusta helicopters. i cant deny it and i believe that we have the right to doubt that people behind this are very experienced. they have perfectly practiced the art of doing wrong deeds. they are very experienced and knowledgeable. and one can also smell the fact that such a thing wouldnt have been done without a shield. now, agencies are probing. lets see how far the probe goes. but the investigation shouldnt go ahead while people are being targeted, neither does my government target anyone. the sin has been committed, but how much is done, how was it done, who did it, probe agencies will find out in a professional way. whatever comes out, will be put outarnab: prime minister, talking about your speech in the us congress, and the humour that you displayed. i felt some of it was impromptu. but the americans were able to relate to what you said, i dont remember the exact words, you said, i am informed that the working of the us congress is harmonious. and then there was a pause and people were laughing. then you said, i am told  you emphasized and said i am told that you are well known for your bipartisanship. then the applause was more. and then you said, you are not alone. time and again i have witnessed a similar spirit in the indian parliament. you spoke about a serious topic in a interesting manner. you referred to the upper house. there was a lot of response on that too. your humour was really appreciated and i think it was a wonderful moment when you were speaking. but, mr. prime minister, when you look back at the parliament, this question comes to many peoples minds, has prime minister narendra modi being held back from achieving his own objectives because of the non-stop parliamentary logjam. how much has this affected his moving towards his own targets? if you critically analyze this situation, do you feel your government could have been more consultative or do you feel the blame is entirely with the opposition?pm modi: i look at it differently. i believe there have been a lot of problems. whether the fault is ours or theirs, i ll leave it to the people. people will decide. but because of discussions in parliament  we may not come to a decision, the decision could be opposing our view, nothing wrong in that. but at least there should be a discussion. the sad part is, if somebody is running away from debate or dont let discussions happen, then it is a cause of worry in a democracy. whether the governments work is accomplished or not, i dont see it as a cause of worry. if not today, it will happen tomorrow. there are certain things which will happen at an administrative level. the big thing is, parliament is for discussion. parliament is to show dissent. parliament is to give an argument for ones opposition, to present an argument when they support.to uphold this basic spirit of parliament, is the responsibility of every person who values democracy. it is the responsibility of those present in the parliament and those outside. it is the responsibility of those in power and those not in power. this is a matter of spirit and it should be followed. as far as the government is concerned, on every issue and at every forum, we have tried to hold discussions. i myself have met the opposition leaders and spoken to them. key members of the government are also in touch. and you must have seen that many issues have been resolved. in the last session, we have passed 12 bills in rajya sabha, we passed 10 bills in the lok sabha. so the pace has picked up. when people say opposition, it is unfair to the opposition. there are some parties in the parliament which are not with the bjp or nda, but are with the government on key decisions. so, to defame the opposition by saying that all opposition parties are against us  when some people do this, it is wrong. there is one party which has problems. and the whole world knows that party. secondly, to say that when you were is opposition, you did it this way there is a difference between every opposition party. we have run the government for 60 years and now we are in the opposition, so we know the nitty-gritties of the government, we know the responsibilities. we cant behave in the way, a new opposition party behaves. a party which hasnt been in power or hasnt seen anything, could behave in this way. for example, we are in power now, and consider in 2040 we become the opposition party. so, in 2040 we cant have the same conduct as the one we had in 2009 or 2010.arnab: congress is a very experienced and old partypm modi: thats why i say that, those who have been in power for so many years, shouldnt be doing this. if there is a new party in the opposition, they have a small demand for their state or if an mp has a demand for his/her constituency and does something like this, then we can understand. ones who have been in power for very long, shouldnt be doing such thingsarnab: prime minister modi, do you think the gst bill which has been stuck for over one and half years, it is a path-breaking economic reform. it unifies the country. recently you met ms jayalalithaa after she was sworn in as the chief minister, mamata banerjee has extended her support for gst and congress allies at the state level are supporting the gst bill. do you feel optimistic that gst bill will be passed in the next session of the parliament?pm modi: first we need to understand, that we look at gst only within the purview of an economic reform because of which the right information doesnt come out. not having gst straight away means loss for the poor of uttar pradesh. absence of gst straight away means loss for the poor people of bihar. not passing the gst would mean loss for the poor people of poor states like bengal, orissa and assam. people who sit in the rajya sabha must understand this. gst is beneficial for the poor people of the states represented by them, because those states will economically benefit the most from gst. the money will be used for the welfare of the poor people of those states. this is why be it mamata banerjee, be it nitish kumar, be it akhilesh yadav or naveen patnaik, all these states want the gst bill to be passed at the earliest. there is just one group which has made it the issue of prestige. now the kind of arithmetic which is working out, i hope that this decision is passed in favour of the poor. you will be surprised to what extent has the opposition reached to the level of distortion. in the previous session we introduced an act. indian government has rs 40,000 crore rupees from the campa fund. rs 40,000 crore. we wanted to give that money to the states. states have to use that money for forestry, for greenery, for planting trees and plants. the bill is meant for that. had this rs 40,000 crore reached the states before the monsoons, it would have been used for the forests. a lot of people would have got employment, people who plant trees would have been employed. there would be plantation and due to the rains the plants would start growing within a year. but just because of obstructionism, states have been deprived of the benefit of rs 40,000 crore. the money was meant for the forests and for the tribals. they blocked it. there was no argument on itarnab: the reasonyou had triedpm modi: made all efforts.arnab: you had invited former prime minister manmohan singh and sonia gandhi here at the race course roadpm modi: we held talks at every levelarnab: still? the word you used ego issue, why has it become an ego issue? and people would want to know why is the prime minister unable to end this?pm modi: the prime minister cannot answer this question. those creating obstructions can only answer this question. but despite this, i will keep trying. i am ready to convince them in which ever way possible. if i have to convoke someone over a cup of tea at their house, i am even ready for that. i have no problem. my only aim is the welfare of the poor of my country and the poor of states like uttar pradesh.arnab: you spoke of uttar pradesh. mr prime minister, elections will be held in uttar pradesh in 6,7,8 months. the focus of entire nation will be on it. you are the mp from varanasi. but some comments are made by bjp, some say sangh parivar, some independent groups, communal colour is added to it and not just from one party but from other parties as well. mr prime minister are you going to be able to keep development as the sole agenda? the main issue in the uttar pradesh polls should be that of development, it shouldnt get capsized, the focus shouldnt be elsewhere. are you confident that communal agenda will not overpower development?pm modi: its my conviction, its my commitment. you must have seen during the 2014 elections that i fought elections on the issue of development. the new generation of the country only believes in development. i believe that solution to all problems is in development. development is also the solution to the tension that people talk about. if we provide employment to people, if we ensure theres food on their plates, if we provide them with facilities and give them education, all the tension will end. and this is why, all those who want good for the nation, i request them to compete towards development and for development. this atmosphere should be created in the country and i think such an environment is being created nowadays.arnab: so the hot heads who make extreme comments, is there a necessity to control them? so that there is no politics in the name of religionpm modi: firstly, i am of the firm belief that the nation should progress on the issue of development. and it is necessary that the country moves forward on the issue of development. i would like to tell the media not to make heroes out of those people who make such comments.arnab: but they keep making such commentspm modi: dont make them heroes, they will stoparnab: we dont make them heroes, we make them villains.pm modi: but why do you make them so big? i see such statements by people on tv, whose faces i havent even seen and they end up becoming spokesmen on tvarnab: self styled spokesmenpm modi: i dont know why such people are encouragedarnab: mr prime minister, lets talk in 2016 of the 2017 elections. after delhi, then bihar, then assam, west bengal. after that we will talk about punjab. before we finish talking about punjab, we will talk about uttar pradesh. then there is the gujarat state election. dont you think that this country is permanently stuck in an electoral cycle? the focus constantly and i want you to reflect on this issue, the focus is on party politics, polarising issues, not on governance. we are a country, if we say, we are constantly in a political campaign mode. is this a good thing? should we break away from it? and what is your view on it?pm modi: see this is not an issue about narendra modi or the prime minister. and also it is not an issue about a particular party or a particular government.but before the last parliament session, the speaker had called all the parties for a meal. after the agenda meeting everyone was sitting to eat. i had also reached at the same time. while talking casually over food, almost people from all parties said that the central and state elections must be held together. everyone said it. after that during the farewell function of the rajya sabha mps, people from different parties were talking with each other. one of the leaders said, modiji do anything but get us out of this cycle of elections.arnab: was that leader from your party?pm modi: no, he was not from my party. so i said that discussion should happen. what is wrong in that? then one day i said that this was being talked about. this issue has also been discussed in a parliamentary committee. this work has also been started by the election commission and i think they have also writen a letter on it. like in the fight against black money, this issue of elections also gets connected to black money. electoral reforms are necessary if the country has to be rid of black money. it is one of the areas for electoral reforms. i believe that the prime minister cannot take a decision on this and nor should he do that. neither the government can do this.there should be a broad discussion on this and we should not run away from the debate on this continious cycle of elections. the indian voter today is very mature. he votes in one fashion in the lok sabha elections, he votes in a different manner in the state assembly elections. we have seen this. in 2014, the general elections conincided with the odisha assembly elections. the same electorate gave one judgement for odisha and another judgement for delhi. so this countrys voter is very mature and we should trust his maturity. there should be a debate on how costs can be reduced by holding simultaneous elections, how the influence of black money can be curbed, how the five years can be spent in taking the country forward. today due to the model code of conduct, there is a loss even in those areas where the code is not applicable.when i was in gujarat, i found that at least 80 to 90 officers were spending two to three months on election duties in other states. this could be happening in every state. so this is an area of concern and some time or the other this question will have to be thought of. i would want the election commission to take this debate forward. they should invite all political parties and hold discussions with everybody and whatever comes out of it.arnab: can there be a timebound resolution in this?pm modi: the election commission will have to invite all political parties to discuss this. the process will get derailed if one party were to initiate this.arnab: are you willing to take the lead in building that consensus?pm modi: despite being the prime minister, i still belong to a political party. the better thing would be for the election commission to initiate this. today the election commission is a very prestigious institution in our country. every political party believes in the election commission and it will further empower this institution and that will be better.arnab: i think it is an interesting idea of simultaneous elections. though state parties, regional parties may feel that it will effect them badly. that the national parties like the bjp will gain.pm modi: odisha is the best example. odisha is the best example. in 2014, the bjp had no advantage in the state but the bjp won on the lok sabha seats. this shows the difference.arnab: mr prime minister how are you keeping your schedule nowadays? i mean you keep a terrifying pace. the number of meetings you hold, people say your officers find it hard to keep up.pm modi: it is not so, it has been 2 years now and everyone is used to the work. i believe that it is such a big country that one must do as much work as possible. so i keep doing that.arnab: before i come to my last question mr prime minister, one issue that i want to come to is the farmers crisis. as you are well aware, there has been a crisis in this country, you referred to it. in that speech to your mps, about which i asked you earlier as well, on 20th may in the central hall of parliament you said that this government is not for myself, this government is for the poor, we must do something for them. the farmers crisis mr prime minster is a reality. i am glad that in this interview you have not avoided the reality, youve faced it, youve talked about it. we have linked our entire future to the monsoons. how do we overcome this from becoming an annual crisis in this country?pm modi: we will have to put stress on water management here. you must have seen that under the pradhan mantri krishi sinchayi yojana, we have put stress on water issues. during these drought days, i met leaders from 11 states separately and sat with them for about 2-3 hours each. the country would have believed that their prime minister is working even if i had held a meeting with 11 of them together for around 10 minutes. but i didnt do that. i sat with leaders from different states separately to understand specific problems and what we could do for water in those states. i am happy, whichever party the state government affiliated to, all the governments focused a lot on water issues this summer.we will reap its benefits this monsoon. using scientific methods for water accumulation and irrigation, collecting water and directing them towards the fields, everyone did that. micro irrigation is stressed upon. even for sugarcane farming, farmers are slowly moving towards micro irrigation which earlier happened through flood irrigation. paddy crops for which large amount of water is used. today, farmers have started using drip irrigation for it. if we do well in water facilities, then one of the problems is solved. after independence, for the first time, we have brought in pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana which can cover maximum number of farmers. the farmer will have to pay only 2%, only 2%, the government will take care of the rest. the farmers will get an assurance. for instance, in maharashtra, the monsoons are expected in the month of june, the farmers have prepared for everything but havent started with the sowing process. now if there are no rains till august, so practically his crops have not been damaged, because he did not sow the seeds.but the pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana even takes this into consideration and benefits the farmer. another important aspect, once the crops are harvested, theyre cut and kept in the field, assuming it has been a good year for crop growth, with 100% crop production, but it hasnt been loaded on trucks and sent to the market yet. and if it rains, even after 15 days of harvesting, if there is loss, it is covered under pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana. second layer of protection, minimum premium with maximum cover. after independence, for the first time, we have brought in pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana. thirdly, first time we have brought in e-mandi concept. farmer in the village, can sell the crops to the best markets in the country through his mobile phone. farmer would set the price at which the crop would be sold. earlier, farmers used to take the produce on carts or tractors, used to go to a mandi 20-25kms away, then due to storage issues, even if they had to sell for rs 10 less than the price, they used to sell it. now, sitting at home the farmer would know what price to sell the crops at. next point is about, food processing, value addition. we opened up 100% foreign direct investment in food processing.for example, if a farmer is selling tomatoes and if a company is processing tomato ketchup then my farmers would benefit from it. the companies that make aerated drinks, coca-cola, pepsi etc, i requested them to add 5% natural fruit juice. in regions near nagpur and vidarbha where oranges are cultivated, coca-cola is going to add 5% of orange juice. if we add 5% natural juice to aerated water, farmers would get their market and their fruits wouldnt go waste. we should have a comprehensive all-out scheme. so much of our land has been damaged. we have brought in soil health card. we have a soil health abhiyan. the farmer will know the fertility of the land through it. whether a fertilizer needs to be used or not, the farmer will understand. on an average, a farmer with 1 hectare of land will be able to save rs 15000-20000. so we have brought in scientific methods. you would know that in our country, farmers used to be lathicharged when they would go to buy urea and they had to buy it in black. we got urea 100% neem coated. earlier, urea used to go to chemical factories, and the government subsidies were stolen in the name of farmers. after neem coating, urea cannot be used for any other purpose except farming.because of neem coating, there is a qualitative change which helps in healing the damaged land. due to neem coating a piece of land that used 10 kgs of urea can now manage with 7 kgs of urea. all these initiatives are in the direction of agriculture and the resuarnab: do you think that the farmers crisis will be resolved, the question i asked, that it wont be an annual affair, the dependence on monsoons will go down?pm modi: see agriculture is a state subject. the indian government has taken initiatives, if the state government are enthusiastic to implement this, which i think they will be. as i told you i met leaders from different states and they worked a lot for water issues. if this works, pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana has direct involvement of the central government, it will have great benefits.arnab: mr prime minister now i have two questions for you.pm modi: this has become too long.arnab: ill club these two (questions) together. youre also enjoying it and i am glad youre speaking mr prime minister because there is so much ground to cover and i think viewers would like to hear your view, sir. actually there are three, if you allow me. theyre short questions. first is that prime minister narendra modi, how much is politics playing on your mind? in the sense that every prime minister, especially someone who is as forthright as you, looks at the next big challenge. is 2019 anywhere in your mind?pm modi: those who have seen me in gujarat, and those who have seen me in the last two years, those who see me without any bias, they will know that i am an apolitical prime minister. apart from elections, i dont get involved into politics ever. you can call elections a necessity, a restraint or a responsibility, we have to do it. i attend many functions, go to different areas, you wouldnt have heard any political comment from me. if i go to a government function, i talk about government related topics. if i attend a railways function i talk about railways, if water then water, if water bodies, then water bodies. my focus is on governance. country has been at greatest loss because governments were run only for elections. governments must not run only for elections. the government should be a bona fide attempt of meeting the demands and expectations of the common people. elections should just be a bi-product. it is a democracy. winning and losing is a part of it. it shouldnt be hyped. you would have seen recently i urged everyone to pay taxes before 30th september. i even said it on mann ki baat yesterday. will a person, who is only concerned with winning elections, say that post 30th september youd face problems?arnab: this was also a warning in a way.pm modi: it is a warning. it is definitely a warning. it is a warning. my first warning is to my government officers to not presume citizens as thieves. i have already given this warning. i have handled my officers first. it took me quite some time. you will be shocked to hear that i have given an early retirement to more than 30 people from income tax department on integrity issues. this isnt a small issue. people who werent transferred since 20 years, i got them transferred. so, one, my focus is on my system. second, i also tell the country, that for the poor of the nation we would have to give out something for the poor in our country. it is my responsibility to give the people an account of every rupee. i will use it at right places. i wont let it get stolen. but if i need to give houses to the poor, we would need revenue. i dont want to increase taxes, i just want taxes to be paid honestly. there is no need to increase the taxes. the country can run without troubling the citizens. i am working towards it. that is why i have given the citizens a chance to pay the taxes till 30th september, whatever it is rs 10,000 or rs. 50,000. if they think they want to come into mainstream, they must and shouldnt be worried. after 30th september, the government will have to take steps. i will not worry about the polls. i will take the necessary steps. i want to work for the poor in my country.arnab: mister prime minister, do some crystal ball gazing for the next three years. for the next three years, to use the cricketing analogy, how do you find your run rate so far and will you have to score at a higher run rate in the next three years to achieve your targets?pm modi: see, no matte at what speed i move forward, i am never satisfied. if today i run at a speed of 100, i keep an aim of running at 200. i think that the world that was behind us, has gone ahead. we need to run a lot to match that level. so we do not need to calculate. we just need to give it all in. and i have given myself in completely. ive been successful is pulling my entire government in. i believe that the country is also committed to move forwardarnab: final question to you mr prime minister, what motivates you the most? first of all as i said, will you be able to keep this pace? what motivates you the most and also if you can share with our viewers honestly what is your one greatest source of worry?pm modi: firstly, i dont live under the burden of worries. problems and challenges are there, you cant deny that. but you must challenge the challenges and not let the challenges turn into worries. this is my principle. i challenge the challenges. i like to face the problems. i dont run away from them. whatever loss i have to face for it, i face it. but i cant leave the country helpless. this responsibility must be taken and i will continue to do so. for all good and bad things, it is my responsibility. i do not regret anything. i believe, people of the country have given me the responsibility and i must fulfill it. thirdly, when i see the poor in our country, it reminds me of the work that i have to do for them. day before yesterday, i was in pune, and met a shrimaan chandrakant ji. a retired teacher with a pension of rs 16000, donates rs 5000 every month for swachh abhiyaan. if a 70 year old retired teacher with children and family at home, without worrying about them, worries about the country, then being the prime minister, i should work a thousand times more than chandrakant ji. this is my inspiration. people of this country who work day and night, they are my inspiration. i look at them and i work even harder.arnab: prime minister narendra modi it has been a privilege. i am grateful for this interview.pm modi: thank youarnab: and thank you on behalf of all our viewers that you spoke frankly. the program is frankly speaking and i am thankful to you that you were so frank.pm modi: i just request you to not create controversies out of this but instead use it for the benefit of the country.arnab: please do not think like that. thank you very muchpm modi: thanks a lot. thank you very much.arnab: thank you very much.for all the latest india news,

Some vendors picked up tomatoes for free, while cattle feasted on the remaining dump.Apparently, he has come all the way to Hyderabad, because tomato prices came down drastically in Anantapur market, Srinivas, a local commission agent, told the media.The situation is similar in other parts of Rayalaseema that are known for production of tomatoes.Read | My business will be finished: Cash crunch hits farmers in PunjabUttar PradeshThe state government has approached several potato-deficit states, offering them to lift surplus potato from the state at an affordable rate in a bid to help its farmers get a better price.The government move comes amidst prevailing low prices of potato that have added to the plight of farmers. The state government has written to potato-deficit states like Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, telling them they can procure potato from UP, horticulture director SP Joshi said.Joshi also blamed farmers, saying they erred in anticipating the price. Potato was selling for Rs 1,500 per quintal till July-August but most farmers chose to sit on the stock, guessing the price will go up further. That did not happen and a new crop of potato from within and outside the state also arrived, compounding the price situation, he explained.

In April, the government procured onions for Rs 6 per kilogram after prices fell to 25 paise per kg in Neemuch.Lalaram Bhatt, a farmer, was in tears after hearing about the price crash.

I promise you I will give you the India which you desired. If someone faces problem, I also feel the pain. I understand their problem but this is only for 50 days, Modi had said in rallies in Gujarat and Goa, referring to the long queues at ATMs and the acute scarcity of cash in cities and towns.With the deadline set by the PM having expired, HT revisited persons and places we had serialised earlier  from Budgam in Kashmir to Guruvayoor in Kerala  to do a reality check on whether Modi has delivered on his pledge to ease the situation for his countrymen. The feedback was mixed:Satleja, SunderbansA mother of two, Pampa Mistry is much happier now. For the most part of November and early December, she had been worried about her husband, Ramesh, who returned late in the night despite the danger posed by lurking Royal Bengal tigers.As a business correspondent of the State Bank of India and the only source of currency for residents of the remote island with no bank branches or ATMs, Ramesh had to put in long hours in the wake of the November 8 demonetisation announcement.As long queues formed outside his office and tempers rose over non-availability of cash, Ramesh struggled and had to stay back in office till late.Read | 50 days of demonetisation: ATM queues shorter but ripples to remain in JanuaryThings have got better now and he is returning home before sunset, much to the delight of his wife.Earlier I used to get only Rs 20,000 a day from the SBI Gosaba branch for distribution among the villagers, that too mostly in denominations of Rs 2,000. But now I get Rs 50,000 every day and all in denominations of Rs 50. The villagers are happy and I am relieved, Ramesh says.I can go home early now, he adds.Yavatmal, MaharashtraKalawati Bandurkar, the widow of a farmer who committed suicide and found herself in the headlines after Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi visited her, is still in distress.Today some guests are coming to my house with a marriage proposal for my youngest daughter, Sonia, but I cant offer them anything more than a cup of tea. There is no money at home, she says.Kalawati has been struggling since November 8 to lay her hands on cash. Following Gandhis visit, an NGO extended financial help and opened a fixed deposit in her name at a bank. Kalawati is entitled to Rs 14,000 as monthly interest, but has been finding it difficult to withdraw money from the nearest bank some 25 km away.She visited the Central Bank of India in Maregaon two days ago and had to return with just Rs 6,000 after a four-hour wait.Read | 1000 raids in 50 days: Taxman monitoring deposits of Rs 2 lakh and aboveResidents of the region notorious for farm distress and farmer suicides have similar complaints, alleging that the situation at banks has not improved.Shrihari Dhoke from Chanoda says non-availability of cash is derailing his plans for Rabi crop despite a good Kharif harvest. As every link in this chain is almost entirely settled in cash, the absence of currency in the system has affected the overall post-harvest activity, he pointed out.Lanura, KashmirUnlike the rest of the country, the Valley never witnessed queues outside ATMs. Locals attributed the phenomenon to months of unrest that left people impoverished. No money meant no queues, they said in the days following the demonetisation announcement.Though declared the states first cashless village, Lanura, about 25km from Srinagar, epitomises the challenges faced by the administration, post-demonetisation.Read | Note ban not enough: Corruption in India is like water, it finds a wayLanura is cashless in the sense it is facility-less. People are poor and earn very little, there is not even one ATM here, there is electricity for only a few hours in a day, and infrastructure is in shambles, said Aashiq Hussain, a government employee. And do you think we can do e-transactions when the mobile internet network is so weak in the village? he added.Consequently, the local grocer, chemist, tailor and gas cylinder seller are all using cash in their daily transactions.Khokh, PunjabNek Singh, who sells seeds and saplings  from potatoes to tomatoes, chillies and onions has not had a change of heart.Few weeks ago, the owner of the sprawling nursery had been critical of note-bandi. Weeks later, he still insists demonetisation is ruinous for farmers.Even now there is no money in the banksWe have to wait for days to get meagre cash, which is not sufficient to meet expenses for our family and agricultural needs, he said.He pointed out that vegetable growers have suffered immensely. Potato prices have crashed to Rs 2.5 a kilogram, carrot to Rs 2 and cauliflower to just Rs 1 a kilogram. Traders have no money and farmers are begging before commission agents in mandis to buy their produce at whatever price and commission agents are fleecing them, he pointed out.Punjab farmer Nek Singh complains that vegetable growers like him have been hit by demonetisation as the value of their yield has fallen. (Bharat Bhushan/HT Photo)Singh has had a bumper potato crop but that brings him no cheer. The potatoes that I have grown over 40 acres will accrue me a loss of at least Rs 8 lakh. Is there a plan with the government to compensate the farmers? he asked angrily.His potatoes are ripe and ready for harvest but he has been unable to muster courage to start extracting the vegetables. Other potato farmers have lost Rs 20,000 rupees per acre. Imagine what my loss would be, he muttered.Guruvayoor, KeralaEven the six-odd ATMs in the immediate vicinity of the famous Guruvayoor Sri Krishna temple with a bank balance of Rs 1,500 crore and 500 kg gold reserves had run out of cash following demonetisation.But now, things have improved and the machines are again spewing out cash.Read | Farmers hit as vegetable prices crash down after demonetisationThe makers of equally famous Guruvayoor papad are also upbeat. Business is picking up once again, though one manufacturer said sales were still down. As against the normal sale of 1,000 kg a month, I now sell 500 kg, he said.Though the papad maker has survived, two of his staff were not as lucky. They were laid off and are currently unemployed.Bastar, ChhattisgarhThough dirt poor, the tribals of the region dreaded the demonetisation effect. Everyone in the region expected a fresh wave of extortion by Maoists seeking to replenish their coffers depleted by the banning of high-value currency.The fear still persists though the extortion hasnt begun yet. They know very well there is no money with the common villagers just now because villagers are not getting enough cash from selling their paddy crop. Hence they are waiting for tendupatta (tendu leaves) season, pointed out Sunil Baghel.Read | Demonetisation could take away 400,000 jobs;e-com to be worst hitIn tendupatta season, the villagers will get cash from the contractors and then I believe they (Maoists) will ask for Rs 100 per villager.

He also said that it would bail out the crisis-ridden farm sector of Vidarbha that is infamous for farmer suicides.The company plans to develop a modern food park by building a Rs 1000-crore plant, and manufacture juice made from the famous Nagpuri orange. This would be the first time that orange juice made from local fruit would be packaged as a brand, the yoga guru said.Union minister Gadkari, who has been instrumental in getting Ramdev to invest in food parks and allied business in the region, claimed that the yoga gurus company Patanjali would be a boon for the farmers of the region and it would usher in modernization of the Nagpur city.According to him, tribals from Gadchiroli, Gondia and Chandrapur who make a living collecting forest produces, like medicinal plants and herbs would benefit hugely from this initiative.Farmers will be trained by Patanjali workers to grow orange, aloe vera, tomato and herbs according to the specification of the company and given a purchase guarantee.

Patanjali has assured to fulfill all these norms, the chief minister said. The plant is expected to link nearly 50,000 farmers suppliers, create direct employment for over 10,000 people and eventually provide indirect employment to lakhs of families.Regarding the land deal, senior Congress leader Muttemwar had said that as against the running rate of Rs 60-lakh per acre, Patanjali has been charged only Rs 25-lakh an acre. He said that this deal was against all norms and hence should be probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) as the state-run MIHAN had acquired land from farmers and was giving it on a platter to Patanjali as a special favour.Muttemwar alleged that the deal was nothing but the BJP government was repaying a favour to Ramdev who had campaigned wholeheartedly for the party during the 2014 general elections.","yoga guru ramdev has claimed that the employment generated by his mega food park, launched on saturday, would bail out debt-ridden farmers in vidarbha.the announcement was made at the launch of the park in multi-model international cargo hub and airport, nagpur (mihan) in presence of the chief minister devendra fadnavis, the union minister for transport and shipping, nitin gadkari and a huge gathering of farmers.read: ramdevs company to set up food park in nagpurpatanjali to set up orange juice plant in nagpurthe proposed food park, spread over 230-acre of land would provide direct employment to 10,000 people, said ramdev. we are fighting to make our country economically independent and freedom from multi-national companies by promoting indigenous and natural products, he claimed. he also said that it would bail out the crisis-ridden farm sector of vidarbha that is infamous for farmer suicides.the company plans to develop a modern food park by building a rs 1000-crore plant, and manufacture juice made from the famous nagpuri orange. this would be the first time that orange juice made from local fruit would be packaged as a brand, the yoga guru said.union minister gadkari, who has been instrumental in getting ramdev to invest in food parks and allied business in the region, claimed that the yoga gurus company patanjali would be a boon for the farmers of the region and it would usher in modernization of the nagpur city.according to him, tribals from gadchiroli, gondia and chandrapur who make a living collecting forest produces, like medicinal plants and herbs would benefit hugely from this initiative.farmers will be trained by patanjali workers to grow orange, aloe vera, tomato and herbs according to the specification of the company and given a purchase guarantee. a team of scientists and other experts are also working on the project that is expected to change the farm economy of the region.speaking on the occasion, the chief minister, fadnavis dismissed the allegations levelled by the former union minister, vilas muttemwar that the government has given the plot of land to patanjali at less than half of the cost that other investors have paid at mihan.the process involved at giving the land to patanjali was transparent. we had floated tenders thrice and patanjali ayurveda was found to be the right choice in the bidding as per the central vigilance commission norms, fadnavis said.the government wanted a commitment to procure raw materials to the tune of at least rs 100 crore per annum from the farmers and members of tribal community within the surrounding area.it also laid a condition that the bidder should commit to train minimum 2,000 farmers per year across maharashtra to improve productivity, quality and market intelligence to get them ready for agro business development in consultation with agriculture department. patanjali has assured to fulfill all these norms, the chief minister said. the plant is expected to link nearly 50,000 farmers suppliers, create direct employment for over 10,000 people and eventually provide indirect employment to lakhs of families.regarding the land deal, senior congress leader muttemwar had said that as against the running rate of rs 60-lakh per acre, patanjali has been charged only rs 25-lakh an acre. he said that this deal was against all norms and hence should be probed by the central bureau of investigation (cbi) as the state-run mihan had acquired land from farmers and was giving it on a platter to patanjali as a special favour.muttemwar alleged that the deal was nothing but the bjp government was repaying a favour to ramdev who had campaigned wholeheartedly for the party during the 2014 general elections."

He gets up at dawn to supervise the harvesting of his tomato crop, spread over 45 acre of lush green field. Some days are more hectic when tomatoes are loaded onto a truck bound for Azadpur mandi in Delhi or Attari border in Amritsar.The climate in Nimar is favorable for growing tomatoes- both the desi and hybrid varieties. Besides catering to the domestic market, we export tomatoes to Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal by road, Mourya told HT.The hybrid variety of tomato is in great demand in Pakistan where they use it for making meat curries while the small desi variety is much sought after in Nepal, he said.Like Mourya, many farmers in Khargone and Ratlam districts export tomatoes to Pakistan. The trade takes place through export agencies in Amritsar via the Attari-Wagah border. While business was good in 2015, this year, exports have plunged as Pakistan has harvested good tomato crop due to an unusually warm winter.During the peak season in October-November, 50-60 trucks, each with a capacity of 15 tonne, pass through the border every day. Tomatoes are mainly sourced from Nashik in Maharashtra and MP, Sanjiv Puri, an Amritsar-based custom house agent, told HT over the phone.Cold climate is not suitable for tomato crop, especially in areas where there is frost and snowfall so the yield is poor in Pakistan, said Krishnapal Singh, Shivpal Mouryas younger brother. Few people know that tomato prices have crashed in the domestic market not only due to arrival of fresh crop but also because of oversupply as exports to Pakistan through the Wagah border are almost negligible this season, he said.State agriculture director ML Meena said, Areas under tomato cultivation in the state has gone up due to the growing demand in the domestic as well as overseas markets.Tomatoes grown in Khargone, Ratlam and other parts of the state are superior in quality, he said.Shortages of tomatoes in Pakistan give handsome returns to growers in MP, farmers said. We get more than double the price in Pakistan compared to the domestic prices but then the transportation costs are higher, said Anoopchand, a farmer who exported tomatoes worth Rs 1.10 crore in 2015.Exports to Bangladesh will pick up in March and we also export to Nepal where the small-sized desi varieties are in demand as they use whole tomatoes in their recipes, he said.The tomato crop, which takes three to four months to mature, is grown twice a year- in July-October period and in November-February.Hybrid versus desiTomatoes grown in Khargone, Ratlam and other parts of the state are superior in qualityFor hybrid tomato, two different varieties of tomato plants are combined to produce a variety with beneficial traits from both the parents.
