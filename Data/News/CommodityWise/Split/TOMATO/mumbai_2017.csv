A lot of problems in the agriculture sector are due to floods and droughts caused by climate change, Swaminathan said, adding focus should also be on providing convenient loans to women farmers to encourage participation.Right to Food campaigner Dipa Sinha dubbed the Budget a continuation of disappointments, especially for women and child welfare. There is focus on maternity benefit, which is good, but the funds allocated for it will not be sufficient for its universal applicability, she said. She was surprised that the finance minister chose to give malnutrition a pass, particularly after it was sharply brought to focus recently with several tragic deaths in Maharashtra.","bengaluru: feb 2, 2017, dhnsthe budget has failed to focus on the farm activities on the fringes of urban areas, an important strategy in taming food inflation, renowned agricultural scientist ms swaminathan has said.reform is needed in peri-urban agriculture since it can solve problems in containing the prices of tomato and onion, swaminathan told dh, pointing out that the crucial farm strategy has been conspicuously missing from the attention of successive finance ministers.the agricultural scientist said jaitley has also failed to consider the impact of climate change on farming. a lot of problems in the agriculture sector are due to floods and droughts caused by climate change, swaminathan said, adding focus should also be on providing convenient loans to women farmers to encourage participation.right to food campaigner dipa sinha dubbed the budget a continuation of disappointments, especially for women and child welfare. there is focus on maternity benefit, which is good, but the funds allocated for it will not be sufficient for its universal applicability, she said. she was surprised that the finance minister chose to give malnutrition a pass, particularly after it was sharply brought to focus recently with several tragic deaths in maharashtra."

Students are given lectures thrice a week on how to maintain the garden by urban farming groups like Start Upcycling Now (SUN) and iKheti, which helped the school to set up the garden.The project started in July 2016 after Father Gregory, the schools manager, roped in 240 students of Class 8 and explained the idea. Fascinated by the idea of having their own garden, the students immediately swung into action. Each class is divided into four sections and each division was assigned four gardens each.In a concrete jungle like Mumbai, a terrace garden awakens a sense of environmental consciousness and becomes a forum for knowledge. It also provides a variety of organic and fresh vegetables right at your doorstep, said Father Gregory.He added that a special period has been dedicated for the students to do the gardening work, which includes watering the plants, planting new vegetables, adding soil and compost or removing saplings, everything is done in the Work Experience period once a week.To execute the project, students created soil beds using clay bricks. A plastic sheet was spread on the brick base to prevent water from seeping through. Later, seven inch thick soil layer is spread on the plastic and is mixed with mulch comprising shredded cardboard and dry leaves. This helps soil to retain moisture even on the hot days.We should not just teach students phrases, but also make them apply those in real life. This is their real education. Now, they are so involved in it that they even utilise their recess time nurturing the plants, said Gracy Solomon, principal, OLPS.StudentspeakCommenting on the initiative, Razeen Sayyed, 13, said, We (each division) get 30 minutes with our respective gardens during which we must ensure that everything is fine with the crop. If everything is okay, and we are left with some time, we make self-irrigation bottles.The terrace garden produces brinjals, tomatoes, ladies fingers (okra), lemon grass, lemons and carom seeds (ajwain), which is appreciated not only by their treachers but also the monkeys who visit the garden in search of fresh vegetables.Monkeys eat our entire tomato crop. So to keep them at bay, we installed a scare crow, said Aaradhya Patil, 13.On each patch of garden, there are boards with information on the plants and their uses. For example, pentas plant is used as a popular medicine in malaria and lime to relieve asthma.Kids should understand how the plants are grown from scratch and that even a day of not watering can take away all their hard work, said Priyanka Shah, founder, iKheti, adding In this way, they also learn to respect food and become sensitive towards the environment.Organic fertilisersThe compost that they use in the garden comes from the waste created in the school campus. The school has eight drums in a set of four for each division where they dump organic waste, which is later used as fertiliser.Students do all the legwork they can for the environment. Aerobic composting is something that you just have to dump it and almost everything else is taken care of the microorganisms. The students of the school make sure that no waste goes out to the dump yard from the school, said Natasha DCosta, SUN founder.After the crop comes to fruition, the saplings are handed over to the students. Sanket Gauri, a student of Class VIII, said, We showed it to our parents and friends, and now even they want to be a part of it.

File photo: C. VenkatachalapathyWith the start of a new year, affordable prices are something that many consumers would look for. For a week now, mixed prices are prevailing in the vegetable markets, as traders say that the price of few vegetables have shot up, while the cost of a few have dropped, and these rates are here to stay for at least another week.The last week of 2016 saw the price of some vegetables such as onions, beans and broad beans (avarakkai) shoot up due to various reasons, according to A. Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam.The rates of beans and avarakkai have increased in the last two days. This is primarily because the quality of vegetables is good but the supply is less. Many consumers are purchasing the two vegetables and this has hiked the prices. These vegetables are supplied from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, he said.From costing Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 earlier, the rate of one kilo of beans has doubled toRs. 30 now, while the price of avarakkai has gone up from Rs. 15 to Rs. 25.All is not well with onions too. Mr. Balu said the onions supplied from Andhra Pradesh that were of medium size and even smaller used to be sold for Rs. 5 or Rs. 6 in Vellore.Now, the supply from AP has stopped, and onions from parts of Maharashtra such as Pune and Ahmednagar have started to arrive. Those procuring the stock have to pay Rs. 5 per kilo on commission and toll. So, onions are sold at Rs. 15 to Rs. 20 to fetch profit, he said.He added that it would take at least a week for the price of onions supplied from Maharashtra to stabilise.Drumsticks rate has also gone up as the mist affected flowering and yield. It was sold for Rs. 80.The rate of peas, which are usually priced high, could come as a surprise. The price dropped from Rs. 80 to Rs. 25 to Rs. 30 last week, he said.While small onions (a kilo) costs Rs. 20, tomatoes are priced at Rs. 5 to Rs. 8. Potatoes cost Rs. 12 to Rs. 14, while ladys finger is priced at Rs. 25 to Rs. 30. The local thorny variety of brinjal is priced at Rs. 30 a kilo, while carrot is sold for Rs. 10.The rates of other vegetables are  cabbage  Rs. 6 to Rs. 8, ginger  Rs. 20 to Rs. 40, snake gourd  Rs. 12, bitter gourd  Rs. 15 to Rs. 20, pumpkin  Rs. 10, green chillies  Rs. 20 to Rs. 30, and coriander (a bunch)  Rs. 25 to Rs. 30.Coconut was sold for Rs. 5 to Rs. 8 (local), while those from Pollachi cost Rs. 10 to Rs. 20.The same rates will continue for a week, Mr. Balu said.","traders in vellore say the quality of some of the vegetables is good but their supply is insufficient. file photo: c. venkatachalapathywith the start of a new year, affordable prices are something that many consumers would look for. for a week now, mixed prices are prevailing in the vegetable markets, as traders say that the price of few vegetables have shot up, while the cost of a few have dropped, and these rates are here to stay for at least another week.the last week of 2016 saw the price of some vegetables such as onions, beans and broad beans (avarakkai) shoot up due to various reasons, according to a. balu, president of vellore town nethaji market kaikari vyabarigal sangam.the rates of beans and avarakkai have increased in the last two days. this is primarily because the quality of vegetables is good but the supply is less. many consumers are purchasing the two vegetables and this has hiked the prices. these vegetables are supplied from andhra pradesh and karnataka, he said.from costing rs. 10 to rs. 15 earlier, the rate of one kilo of beans has doubled tors. 30 now, while the price of avarakkai has gone up from rs. 15 to rs. 25.all is not well with onions too. mr. balu said the onions supplied from andhra pradesh that were of medium size and even smaller used to be sold for rs. 5 or rs. 6 in vellore.now, the supply from ap has stopped, and onions from parts of maharashtra such as pune and ahmednagar have started to arrive. those procuring the stock have to pay rs. 5 per kilo on commission and toll. so, onions are sold at rs. 15 to rs. 20 to fetch profit, he said.he added that it would take at least a week for the price of onions supplied from maharashtra to stabilise.drumsticks rate has also gone up as the mist affected flowering and yield. it was sold for rs. 80.the rate of peas, which are usually priced high, could come as a surprise. the price dropped from rs. 80 to rs. 25 to rs. 30 last week, he said.while small onions (a kilo) costs rs. 20, tomatoes are priced at rs. 5 to rs. 8. potatoes cost rs. 12 to rs. 14, while ladys finger is priced at rs. 25 to rs. 30. the local thorny variety of brinjal is priced at rs. 30 a kilo, while carrot is sold for rs. 10.the rates of other vegetables are  cabbage  rs. 6 to rs. 8, ginger  rs. 20 to rs. 40, snake gourd  rs. 12, bitter gourd  rs. 15 to rs. 20, pumpkin  rs. 10, green chillies  rs. 20 to rs. 30, and coriander (a bunch)  rs. 25 to rs. 30.coconut was sold for rs. 5 to rs. 8 (local), while those from pollachi cost rs. 10 to rs. 20.the same rates will continue for a week, mr. balu said."

Several tropes from the Vijay films are replicated here  the precocious childhood, the early initiation into the world of crime, the abiding influence of the Mother figure, the bonding within the community of crooks, the loyalty for the mentor and the eventual breaking away and establishment of ones own power centre. And, of course, the wordplay in dialogue after dialogue. My favourite is the mother saying that she doesnt want to give her son to acquire udhar ka nazariya (borrowed point of view) but to have his own chaukas nazar (a sharp insight).Yet theres more to the film. If Vijay addressed the angst of the day and the prevalent cynicism against the system, Raees, though lot less intense and brooding and more brassy and overstated, is also rooted in a specific point in time and a place. Raees is the Vijay of Gujarat (thankfully more than the song and dance, operatic, folksy Gujarat of Sanjay Leela Bhansali) where business is so paramount that even prohibition leads to its inevitable illicit trade offshoots, where bootlegging is a strong commercial force thriving on political nexus.

A messiah lost to the people, the state and nation.RaeesDirector: Rahul DholakiaStarring: Shah Rukh Khan, Mahirah Khan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub, Atul Kulkarni, Sheeba Chaddha, Narendra Jha, Loveleen MishraRun Time: 144 mins","on the big screen vijay pal singh (amitabh bachchan) is hauling up seth dhanraj puri (prem chopra) for putting profiteering above the safety of his mine workers. an equivalent of this popular scene from yash chopras kala patthar (1979) is playing out simultaneously in a car in the drive-in theatre with don raees (shah rukh khan) ordering a mill owner to give the neighbourhood workers their rightful wages. its a scene that puts in a nutshell one of the many things that rahul dholakia is trying to do with srk in raees making him play a version of the angry young man of the 70s and the 80s.quite like big bs vijay, raees is anti-establishment, an outlaw and also a robin hood figure; a vigilante who is the voice of the voiceless, the underdog and the marginal. several tropes from the vijay films are replicated here  the precocious childhood, the early initiation into the world of crime, the abiding influence of the mother figure, the bonding within the community of crooks, the loyalty for the mentor and the eventual breaking away and establishment of ones own power centre. and, of course, the wordplay in dialogue after dialogue. my favourite is the mother saying that she doesnt want to give her son to acquire udhar ka nazariya (borrowed point of view) but to have his own chaukas nazar (a sharp insight).yet theres more to the film. if vijay addressed the angst of the day and the prevalent cynicism against the system, raees, though lot less intense and brooding and more brassy and overstated, is also rooted in a specific point in time and a place. raees is the vijay of gujarat (thankfully more than the song and dance, operatic, folksy gujarat of sanjay leela bhansali) where business is so paramount that even prohibition leads to its inevitable illicit trade offshoots, where bootlegging is a strong commercial force thriving on political nexus. the subversive streak is visible right from the start when the voiceover says pabandi bagawat ki shuruaat hoti hai (imposing restrictions leads to rebellion). where there is a will there has to be a way. so you have alcohol-shot tomatoes on sale and liquor consumed in teacups.along with all of this dholakia also channels the early dark avatars of srk  in baazigar and darr . but what is most interesting is how dholakia sets up raees within a religious context. in chak de india srks kabir khan recited his own prayer, nasrun minal lahe wah fatahun kareeb (god give me strength to win). my name is khan s rizwan batted for islam in a post 9/11 world. in raees , srk makes a dramatic entry in a muharram procession.srk and dholakia dare rather than play safe. the character, ostensibly based on the life of criminal abdul latif, walks on the razors edge. its a complicated portrayal. some would complain of a whitewash regarding the alleged dawood and mumbai blast linkages. the film begins with a person who puts business above religion and doesnt intend to harm others. betrayals lead him on to cross over to the dark side. more severe transgressions  like encouraging rioting and violence  follow. yet he is also the masiha (messiah) who feeds the needy and affected.neither hindu, nor muslim should die of hunger, says raees. he is a parallel government to the community.yet raees is not a superman, hes a man who uses the system as much as he is used. who kills yet cries at his failure to provide housing to his community. raees is more of a shakespearean tragic hero, so is his fall.the moral compass remains intact. and the characters transgressions are not denied. there is no escaping the guilt either. mohalla bachate bachate shehar jala diya (in trying to save the neighbourhood i set the town afire, he says. the crime has to be followed by punishment, the order restored. begunahon ko maar kar jannat naseeb nahin hogi (you wont be able to find heaven by killing the innocent).raeess adversary, a cop jaideep ambalal majmudar (nawazuddin siddiqui), gets equal play. its a cat and mouse game between equals. in fact, with his poker-faced jokes, sharp lines and michael jackson entry, siddiqui gets to play to the gallery more than srk himself and remains one up on him throughout.there are some nice touches. like majmudar snooping on the love chat between raees and his wife and then smilingly hooking off. he is human after all.the supporting cast shines but one wishes there was more of sheeba chaddha and loveleen mishra.if it is gujarat can gandhi be far behind? early on in the film there is a lovely scene of raees stealing a pair of spectacles from the gandhi statue because he cant afford to buy a frame for himself. a doctor asks him to put the glasses back on the statue and gives him another pair, a pair that eventually comes to stand for entirely the opposite of gandhis vision of non-violence. a messiah lost to the people, the state and nation.raeesdirector: rahul dholakiastarring: shah rukh khan, mahirah khan, nawazuddin siddiqui, mohammed zeeshan ayyub, atul kulkarni, sheeba chaddha, narendra jha, loveleen mishrarun time: 144 mins"

For Mumbai's minuscule peace loving Zoroastrian community comprising 50,000 odd Parsis and Iranis, Navroze is celebrated with a lot of fervour.The numerous Parsi baugs dotted along the city come alive with the cheerful greetings of 'Navroze Mubarak' after which the faithful make a trip to the neighbourhood agiary or atash behram  most of them in south Mumbai  to pray and offer sandalwood to the holy fire that burns inside. The agiaries have been scrupulously cleaned in the days leading to Navroze and decorated with beautiful divas and fresh flowers. Some Zoroastrians have jasans  thanksgiving prayers performed by priests  at home while some make a trip to the Iranshah at Udwada  the holiest place of worship for Zoroastrians.Houses are spruced up, the most expensive China and fancy linen is brought out, colourful intricate rangoli is made at the entrance and colourful bead and glass torans are hung across thresholds.

The rising temperature has been affecting the flowering process of vegetables and has brought the state's production down by 50% this season, said sources from Vegetable Growers Association of India The situation is particularly worrisome in Pune, Nashik, Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur that are known to be major vegetable growing areas.Shriram Gadhave, president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India, told TOI that vegetables that are in the flowering stage have been adversely affected by the recent heatwave and the ongoing temperature conditions in parts of Maharashtra. ""The yield of all vegetables has dipped by 50% due to the current weather conditions. The high heat burns the flowers that are meant to fruit later,"" said Gadhave.He added that leafy greens, beans, tomatoes, cauliflower, pointed gourd and cucumbers, among others, have been affected. Narendra Pawar , who heads a farmer producer company with 2,500 vegetable growers from Pune, Satara and Ahmednagar, said that major vegetable growing districts -Nashik and Pune - have been most-affected. ""Water shortage and increasing temperature prevent the vegetable flowers from fruiting, resulting in a 30% to 40% drop in production and supply into markets across Maharashtra. The heat has not only been turning the leaves of vegetable black but is also hampering the growth of plants,"" he said.According to Gadhave, the high temperature conditions seem to be more conspicuous this year and the major vegetable growing belt in west Maharashtra has been affected the most. ""Though the area cultivating vegetables in Maharashtra is huge, production has not been up to the mark this season due to the sudden spike in mercury during the latter half of March and in April.

In spite of heavy rains and a spurt in farm productivity, the scourge of suicides continues to spread. The highest number of suicides was in Beed (23), hometown of rural minister Pankaja Munde, followed by Nanded (22), Osmanabad (19), Aurangabad (18), Jalna (14), Parbhani and Hingoli (8 each) and Latur (5). Of the 117 cases, financial aid was provided to 46 families of the deceased. But 13 were denied relief and 58 proposals are still being processed.Head of a state-level task force on farmer welfare, Kishore Tiwari, said while the government had taken various measures, the results were not visible. ""We'll have to redraft our strategy to halt farmer suicides,"" Tiwari said. ""We will have to provide remunerative prices for agriculture produce, along with market intervention.

""Farmers come there to auction their produce to sellers from Koyambedu. Sellers in turn sell it to other wholesale dealers in Chennai in bulk boxes like 200, 100 and 50. These dealers in turn distribute to warehouses or retail shops, who in sell it to the customer. On average the produce changes hands six times and becomes that much more expensive for customers and farmers, who have to pay a commission to truck loaders,"" said Rajamohan.With E-Vegetailing middlemen are eliminated and farmers can get the full market price for their products.""We have to pay a 10% commission to truckers who pick up our goods. Going online has helped our goods fetch better prices at zero commission,"" Palaniswamy said.Another differentiater is the startup's revenue model.""We don't charge the farmers, we charge only the customers. So farmers are happy to get onboard our platform. Once customers get a sample of our quality of service, they keep coming back to us,"" said Rajamohan.

It now employs 35 people and has 30 procurement centres.With 20 years of experience in the logistics sector and handing airline cargo, Rajamohan feels that while e-commerce may be a boat everyone is trying to sail on, the difference he brings to the business is his innovations in logistics and professionalism.A proprietary ownership company since the date of its inception, E-Vegetailing was incorporated in July 2016.Last month, The Chennai Angels invested `1.1 crore in the startup, which hopes to use the capital to build its farmer network, increase procurement points and enhance logistics. ""A key issue here is the unorganised nature of how farm produce is brought to stores from farmers, wholesale merchants and dealers. As India moves to a more formal economy, there is great potential in investing in a company like this.

""farmers come there to auction their produce to sellers from koyambedu. sellers in turn sell it to other wholesale dealers in chennai in bulk boxes like 200, 100 and 50. these dealers in turn distribute to warehouses or retail shops, who in sell it to the customer. on average the produce changes hands six times and becomes that much more expensive for customers and farmers, who have to pay a commission to truck loaders,"" said rajamohan.with e-vegetailing middlemen are eliminated and farmers can get the full market price for their products.""we have to pay a 10% commission to truckers who pick up our goods. going online has helped our goods fetch better prices at zero commission,"" palaniswamy said.another differentiater is the startup's revenue model.""we don't charge the farmers, we charge only the customers. so farmers are happy to get onboard our platform. once customers get a sample of our quality of service, they keep coming back to us,"" said rajamohan. e-vegetailing currently has partnered with more than 7,000 farmers across five states - tamil nadu, kerala, andhra pradesh, karnataka and maharashtra - for procurement and distribution. when the company started, it h ad three employees and a handful of pick-up points for vegetables. it now employs 35 people and has 30 procurement centres.with 20 years of experience in the logistics sector and handing airline cargo, rajamohan feels that while e-commerce may be a boat everyone is trying to sail on, the difference he brings to the business is his innovations in logistics and professionalism.a proprietary ownership company since the date of its inception, e-vegetailing was incorporated in july 2016.last month, the chennai angels invested `1.1 crore in the startup, which hopes to use the capital to build its farmer network, increase procurement points and enhance logistics. ""a key issue here is the unorganised nature of how farm produce is brought to stores from farmers, wholesale merchants and dealers. as india moves to a more formal economy, there is great potential in investing in a company like this. e-vegetailing helps both customers and farmers (there is a lot of wastage, when produce changes multiple hands before reaching the end consumer) but this startup employs the right technology and logistics solutions for door-to-door delivery of vegetables,"" aspire systems ceo and co-founder gowri shankar subramanian said.(this series captures the startup ecosystem in the state)"

As the government will not be in a position to announce a waiver at least for a few months, it has swung into action to ensure the indebted farmers are not hassled in getting a loan for seeds, fertilisers and pesticides essential for sowing, which will begin in first week of June, immediately after monsoon sets in. The government is thinking of purchasing seeds and fertilisers and distribute them with the help of NGOs and social organisations.The Opposition has been batting for a loan waiver for farmers similar to the one given in Uttar Pradesh. The Congress, NCP and four smaller parties boycotted proceedings of the Assemblys budget session for three weeks to push the demand. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had declared that his government, too, was in favour of the waiver, but at an appropriate time. He said his government was studying the UP model of a waiver. He also said that rather than a waiver, the thrust would be on sustainable development of agriculture.To reduce expenditure on farm labourers, the government is mulling funding them from the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS). We have not been able to fully utilise the central funds allocated under NREGS, but on the other hand, the cost of farm labourers is unbearable for farmers. By funding farm labour, we can extend a great relief to the farmers helping them to reduce cost of production. Similarly, on other fronts, too, we are tapping the possibilities to extend the benefits to the farmers, said an official from the agriculture department.The cooperation department is planning to restructure the loans given to the farmers to enable them to get fresh loans for the kharip season. The government is also considering health, education and housing schemes in the package so that the socio-economic burden is reduced.It will be a package of various schemes by 3 to 4 departments to ensure farmers are heavily subsidised to bring farming to the level of affordability. Right from testing of the soil health, sufficient supply of water, power supply at subsidised rates to effective marketing of the agriculture products, we are planning to do everything that will minimise the gap between the production cost and the rate in the market, Subhash Deshmukh, cooperation minister, told HT.The government is also tapping the idea of bring about 22 crops in the list of produce with minimum support price. It will bear the cost of difference between the market price and the MSP, particularly for crops such as tomato, onion and grapes, whose rates have fallen this year. Our aim is to bring cost of production to zero for about 1.07 lakh farmers who hold less than 5 acres of land. Instead of giving them money, the government will purchase the things required to cultivate and distribute with the help various organisations working in the sector, the officer said.According to rough estimates, the schemes will cost around Rs10,000 crore if implemented. But the estimates are primary, and depends on the feasibility of the all schemes being tapped. The schemes could be implemented if the government wins over the demand of the loan waiver, which is expected to cost Rs30,500 crore. But it succumbed to pressure for the waiver. It will have to cut short the schemes, another official from the cooperation department said.Read: Sangharsh Yatra: Waive loan before farmers lose patience, say Maharashtra opposition leadersMaharashtra Opposition intensifies attacks on govt, kicks off second Sangharsh Yatra for farm loan waiver","under tremendous pressure from the opposition to approve a loan waiver for farmers, especially after a similar announcement in uttar pradesh, the state government has begun to package multiple schemes to reduce the cost of production of the crops and also ensure assured price for the crops.at least three government departments, including agriculture, cooperation and revenue, are working together to package various schemes. as the government will not be in a position to announce a waiver at least for a few months, it has swung into action to ensure the indebted farmers are not hassled in getting a loan for seeds, fertilisers and pesticides essential for sowing, which will begin in first week of june, immediately after monsoon sets in. the government is thinking of purchasing seeds and fertilisers and distribute them with the help of ngos and social organisations.the opposition has been batting for a loan waiver for farmers similar to the one given in uttar pradesh. the congress, ncp and four smaller parties boycotted proceedings of the assemblys budget session for three weeks to push the demand. chief minister devendra fadnavis had declared that his government, too, was in favour of the waiver, but at an appropriate time. he said his government was studying the up model of a waiver. he also said that rather than a waiver, the thrust would be on sustainable development of agriculture.to reduce expenditure on farm labourers, the government is mulling funding them from the national rural employment guarantee scheme (nregs). we have not been able to fully utilise the central funds allocated under nregs, but on the other hand, the cost of farm labourers is unbearable for farmers. by funding farm labour, we can extend a great relief to the farmers helping them to reduce cost of production. similarly, on other fronts, too, we are tapping the possibilities to extend the benefits to the farmers, said an official from the agriculture department.the cooperation department is planning to restructure the loans given to the farmers to enable them to get fresh loans for the kharip season. the government is also considering health, education and housing schemes in the package so that the socio-economic burden is reduced.it will be a package of various schemes by 3 to 4 departments to ensure farmers are heavily subsidised to bring farming to the level of affordability. right from testing of the soil health, sufficient supply of water, power supply at subsidised rates to effective marketing of the agriculture products, we are planning to do everything that will minimise the gap between the production cost and the rate in the market, subhash deshmukh, cooperation minister, told ht.the government is also tapping the idea of bring about 22 crops in the list of produce with minimum support price. it will bear the cost of difference between the market price and the msp, particularly for crops such as tomato, onion and grapes, whose rates have fallen this year. our aim is to bring cost of production to zero for about 1.07 lakh farmers who hold less than 5 acres of land. instead of giving them money, the government will purchase the things required to cultivate and distribute with the help various organisations working in the sector, the officer said.according to rough estimates, the schemes will cost around rs10,000 crore if implemented. but the estimates are primary, and depends on the feasibility of the all schemes being tapped. the schemes could be implemented if the government wins over the demand of the loan waiver, which is expected to cost rs30,500 crore. but it succumbed to pressure for the waiver. it will have to cut short the schemes, another official from the cooperation department said.read: sangharsh yatra: waive loan before farmers lose patience, say maharashtra opposition leadersmaharashtra opposition intensifies attacks on govt, kicks off second sangharsh yatra for farm loan waiver"

So, notebandias demonetisation is called colloquiallycouldnt have come at a worse time. With money sucked out of the market, there was a tomato glut, and prices crashed by 80%.A 15-kg crate of tomatoes traded this year between Rs 30 and Rs 50 (instead of Rs 700 at its peak), said Kumar. I had no reason to spend on transportation and bring it to the market or wait for the price to pick up. So, I uprooted all my tomato plants in late November to minimise the loss. This is the worst we have seen in my experience.Kolar is the biggest vegetable-growing region in Karnataka, and houses Asias second-largest tomato market. In November, the ruling price of tomatoes in the Kolar market was Rs 3-5 per kg, or 85% lesser than the same time in 2015.Kumars case is echoed across India.

While the prices of tomatoes (hybrid variety) fell by 55-85%, the supply was double and even triple the previous year in parts of India, such as Ahmedabad, Kolkata and Hyderabad, according to data from the National Horticulture Board.In Chennai, for instance, the maximum price a farmer could get per quintal of tomatoes in November 2016 was Rs 760, compared to Rs 4,900 in November 2015, a drop of 85%. The supply to the city was 2,910 metric tonne, an increase of 40% from 2015.In Hyderabad, prices dropped 60% but supply increased 337% in November.Onions were traded anywhere between Rs 650 and Rs 1,500 per quintal in November 2016, compared to Rs 3,027 to Rs 5,600 in 2015.At the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Nashik, Maharashtra, Indias largest wholesale onion market, onions were sold at between Rs 5 and Rs 7 a kilogram.In the seven cities we analysed data for, supply was 196,400 metric tonne in November 2016, against 186,175 metric tonne in November 2015.The situation worsened in December, as prices fell by another 20-50%, and peas traded at a 10-year low in the Delhi market, according to officials from the horticulture department.Enough rains ensured a good harvest but low pricesThe monsoon rains would subside during September to November, and it would result in lesser yield, indicating lesser supply and higher prices, Bellur Krishna, managing director of the state-owned Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society, told IndiaSpend. This year, the rainfall was good in the vegetable-growing regions of Karnataka.This led to good harvest but the prices are also down due to the cash crisis triggered by demonetisation, he said.Kolar, Belagavi, Haveri and Chitradurga, the top vegetable-growing regions in Karnataka, received normal rainfall during the south-west monsoon in 2016.Karnataka declared a drought in 22 districts and some additional talukas in October 2016; the state received Rs 1,782 crore from the central government, IndiaSpend reported on January 10, 2016.The impact of demonetisation could only be to the extent of 20% of the price fall, said Krishna.Demonetisation is expected to hurt agriculture and informal-sector workers, IndiaSpend had reported on November 15, 2016.Around 9.4 million hectares, or 10% of Indias cropped area, is under vegetable cultivation, of which 50% is given to potato, onion and tomato, according to Horticulture Board data.Most of the transactions in fruits and vegetables are in cash, Brajendra Singh, director, National Horticulture Board, told IndiaSpend.

The price of tomatoes had gone up to Rs 50 a kg over the last two years. This year, the climate was favourable and resulted in bumper crops.

Well, a Mumbai start-up may have just hit upon something to save those rotten tomatoes.Science for Society (S4S), a start-up by Matunga-based Institute of Chemical Technology (ICT), has developed a novel packaging technology  ProVegie  that will increase the shelf life of tomatoes by a month.Tomatoes, which are the largest growing commodity globally, including India, usually have a life of five to seven days. The countrys daily consumption of tomatoes is 40,000 tonnes, and post-harvest losses are anywhere between 20% and 40% every year due to poor handling, storage and transportation methods.Developed countries store tomatoes in cold storage that extends their shelf life to 20 days, says Vaibhav Tidke, chief executive officer of S4S. This storage method, however, wont work for Indian farmers since its expensive, and there is no constant electricity supply in villages.A survey of 50 vendors in the city found that unlike onions and potatoes, grocers dont store tomatoes since transportation over large distances damages them, leading to wastage. We want this to change. We want this category of vegetable to move to that of onions and potatoes, so a grocer can also stock them, said Tidke.For the last six months, the S4S team is building a mobile-operated machine that can treat and pack 10,000kg tomatoes per day. It will first treat tomatoes and then package them.ProVegie combines fundamental knowledge of how tomatoes respire and allows this respiration through specially designed packaging to create a self-stable product that will ease storage, transport and logistics, said professor Bhaskar Thorat, who heads the chemical engineering department at ICT, and served as an advisor to S4S.This new packing technology will retain the key nutrients, taste and aroma of tomatoes to serve consumer demands. ProVegie, which will be ready by May this year, is likely to be installed in Nashik, Pune or Aurangabad.According to the model developed by S4S, farmers will sell tomatoes to the start-up and can then take back the processed tomatoes, which can be stored for almost a month and sold in the market. At present, the team is creating a value chain, tying up with grocers, retailers, and companies manufacturing tomato sauces.The S4S team has decided against applying for a patent, instead opting for trade secret intellectual property route. ProVegie is designed to be remotely operated from any place with a mobile phone that will be configured with the SIM card in the machine. This is to ensure that the machine is not opened, said Tidke. So, the operators job will only be to load the tomatoes and see the packaged product.","ever had to throw out the last few squishy tomatoes in your veggie crisper because they went bad too soon? well, a mumbai start-up may have just hit upon something to save those rotten tomatoes.science for society (s4s), a start-up by matunga-based institute of chemical technology (ict), has developed a novel packaging technology  provegie  that will increase the shelf life of tomatoes by a month.tomatoes, which are the largest growing commodity globally, including india, usually have a life of five to seven days. the countrys daily consumption of tomatoes is 40,000 tonnes, and post-harvest losses are anywhere between 20% and 40% every year due to poor handling, storage and transportation methods.developed countries store tomatoes in cold storage that extends their shelf life to 20 days, says vaibhav tidke, chief executive officer of s4s. this storage method, however, wont work for indian farmers since its expensive, and there is no constant electricity supply in villages.a survey of 50 vendors in the city found that unlike onions and potatoes, grocers dont store tomatoes since transportation over large distances damages them, leading to wastage. we want this to change. we want this category of vegetable to move to that of onions and potatoes, so a grocer can also stock them, said tidke.for the last six months, the s4s team is building a mobile-operated machine that can treat and pack 10,000kg tomatoes per day. it will first treat tomatoes and then package them.provegie combines fundamental knowledge of how tomatoes respire and allows this respiration through specially designed packaging to create a self-stable product that will ease storage, transport and logistics, said professor bhaskar thorat, who heads the chemical engineering department at ict, and served as an advisor to s4s.this new packing technology will retain the key nutrients, taste and aroma of tomatoes to serve consumer demands. provegie, which will be ready by may this year, is likely to be installed in nashik, pune or aurangabad.according to the model developed by s4s, farmers will sell tomatoes to the start-up and can then take back the processed tomatoes, which can be stored for almost a month and sold in the market. at present, the team is creating a value chain, tying up with grocers, retailers, and companies manufacturing tomato sauces.the s4s team has decided against applying for a patent, instead opting for trade secret intellectual property route. provegie is designed to be remotely operated from any place with a mobile phone that will be configured with the sim card in the machine. this is to ensure that the machine is not opened, said tidke. so, the operators job will only be to load the tomatoes and see the packaged product."

Two days ago, I spotted them on a different plant (Ashoka tree) in Maharashtra. We need to have more studies to find out their prevalence and their counter measures, NBAIR scientist Sunil Joshi, who led the team, told DH.One of the insects Kilifia acuminata was found on an ornamental fern in Bengaluru, but may threaten mango trees in future, as seen in Egypt. India ranks first among the worlds mango-producing countries, accounting for about 50% of mango production.Southern states like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala have a large area under mango cultivation, and the pest can easily spread from Kerala to other states if left unchecked.Reported from 35 countries around the world, it is also a threat to litchi, jamun, guava, pear, lemon and coffee plants.Another insect called Protopulvinaria longivalvata was found on a pepper climber grown in a kitchen garden. The scientists describe it as a serious pest as the vine was killed by the insects.Joshi and his colleagues reported in the journal Current Science that they collected this insect in large numbers from Vittal, Karnataka which is near the major pepper-growing area of Kasargod in Kerala.The insect can easily spread to such areas in Kerala and become a serious pest, they said.The third species Trijuba oculata was also reported from Bengaluru and Mandya. It could be a threat to custard apple trees and grapevines in Karnataka and Maharashtra.The fourth species Pulvinaria urbicola, Joshi said, was a notoriously destructive one that can be a big threat to potato, tomato, brinjal, bell pepper and capsicum.

It is the problem of plenty troubling the Chhota Udepur tomato farmers.It is the problem of plenty troubling the Chhota Udepur tomato farmers. Many tomato farmers have been forced to discard their crops, as there are no takers. And in the wholesale market, the price of one mound or 25 kg tomato has plummeted to Rs 20 which was Rs 500 last year during the same period.Shantilal Tadvi, 52, had hoped that the harvest of his tomato fields located in the Panej village of Bodeli taluka of Chhota Udepur district would bring cheer to the family this year. However, currently, his harvest of plump, heavy tomatoes is packed in 130 cartons, awaiting a pick up to Ankleshwar and southern Gujarat, where he has been traditionally supplying the fruit. Tadvi is expecting to make at least Rs 100 per maund but is unsure if his best quality crop will fetch the price. The ongoing wholesale rates for tomatoes are as low as Rs 20 per maund.Watch what else is making newsTadvi, like many other farmers in the district, is in distress. Last year, he says, the price for the tomatoes was as much as Rs 500 per maund. I have close to 133 maunds of the first round of harvest. The field will be ready for the second round of harvest soon. At the current wholesale price, I do not know how will I be able to sustain my family of six for the coming months.Many farmers in the district have simply discarded their crops for lack of takers. Through the approximately 15-kilometre stretch of the Bodeli-Naswadi road, lush green fields with red, mature tomatoes hanging in neat clusters wear a deserted look  in many cases the cherry red tomatoes fallen around the fields bear a testimony to the disinterest and helplessness with which farmers have abandoned the crops. This stretch has been a tomato belt for three states  Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.Another farmer Virpal Parmar says many farmers have been forced to throw away their crops to grazing cattle. Farmers are giving away tractors full of tomato vines to the grazers as they know that the crop will fetch no price in the wholesale market. Only those tomato growers, who have been able to produce heavy, large sized fruits will stand a chance of their produce being picked up this year as compared to the small, tart varieties. Most families are in deep distress, says Parmar.The sudden decision to demonetise the currency in November has had a cascading effect on the functioning of the APMC markets and the business of wholesalers, who are unwilling to deal in big numbers, says Parmar.A grazier, Valu Dhana, from Jasdan in Rajkot, has arrived in Chhota Udepur with a large cattle herd. Dhana says he has been fetching several kilograms of tomatoes from nearby villages to feed his cattle for the last one week. As the tomato harvest season came to a close, farmers started telling me to take away their discarded yields of ripe tomatoes as they have no value this year. I have brought in several tractors full for the last 10 days and the cattle are feeding on the tomatoes, says Dhana.Tadvi adds that the farmers are forced to do away with the crop as the cost of picking the fruit is costlier than its market value currently. Each labour has to be paid Rs 60 per day for plucking the ripe tomatoes. If the price is lower than Re 1 per kg in the wholesale market, it makes more sense to discard the crop than to waste money on harvesting it, says Tadvi.However, Chhota Udepur APMC Chairman Atul Patel says that the sharp decline in the prices is due to a bumper crop this year, and not demonetisation. There is a bumper crop this year and that is the only reason why the prices have fallen low. The farmers are discarding the crop right now because we do not have facility for cold storage and it is one of those harvests that is extremely perishable.

The prison agricultural production across 29 prisons in the state has grown leaps and bounds and stands at almost Rs 4 crore in 2016 as compared to Rs 2.54 crore two years ago. The profits from production has also increased by 15-20 per cent. Across the 588 hectares of agricultural land held by the prisons department, the last year saw new technologies, more suitable crops and implementation of schemes in coordination with government departments, the agriculture university and NGOs. Every year, over 800 prisoners are engaged in agricultural activities and avail remissions based on the number of days they work on a farm.Sanjay Phadtare, Technical Officer, Agriculture, Prisons (Maharashtra), said, Farming is the most sought-after activity among prisoners. It gives them remissions. Besides, they are not working within four walls. Remissions and exemptions are given to those that are serving life imprisonment and depending on the number of days he works in the field and his conduct, he will avail remissions. The more he works, the less days he spends in the jail.The prisoners receive wages anywhere between Rs 40 and Rs 55 per day. Last year, a total of Rs 83.29 lakh in wages were paid to prisoners engaged in farming, steep rise compared to previous years.B K Upadhyay, Additional DG and IG, Prisons (Maharashtra), said, We have about 800 hectares of land available, of which over 500 are agricultural land, 57 per cent of which is under irrigation and rest are rain-fed. While the farming programme was started as a rehabilitation activity, it has gained a lot of momentum with a variety of produces, plantation and allied activities being undertaken by us.From the traditional cereal cultivation like rice and wheat, most prisons have now started producing fenugreek, spinach, Rajgira, tomato, potato, onion, ginger and pumpkin.In Punes Yerawada jail, a large area is dedicated to banana tissue culture and mushroom production, besides citrus plantation in Morshi prison and even mulberry plantation in Visapur jail. Sandalwood plantation is also being undertaken in a few prisons including Yerawada and Nashik.Bamboo, mango, teak, jamun and been are also being planted in the available forest area. Also undertaken on a large scale are goat farming, poultry, horticulture, dairy and fisheries.From 2014-2016, we received a funding of about Rs 1.44 crore from the government and we have been using it to enhance technology and increase wages, said Phadtare.The department, apart from improving the quality of seeds and fertilisers, has invested in drip irrigation, over 20 tractors, farm equipment, electric motors and pumps, new crops and seed production, new irrigation methods and even organic farming such as vermi-compost and also biogas plants. A soil analysis was also undertaken with the help of fertilisers that resulted in enhanced production.Earlier, the rates of the produce from our farms were low. Now, we go by the APMC rates. Therefore, the produce gets proper rates. While some of the produce is consumed in jails, the rest is sold in the market. While we have supervisors within the prison, we get help and training from agricultural departments, nearby institutes and even local farmers to improve the skills of prisoners, added Phadtare.According to the department, more funds have been sought from the government.

5922c3ea7be9e01fe6dfa84b,Doubling our farm incomes,http://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/2017/mar/25/doubling-our-farm-incomes-1585549.html,2017-03-25,,The New Indian Express,"Last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the governments goal of doubling the farmers income by 2022. Simple math tells us that this would require the farmers income to rise by around 12 per cent per year on average, over the next five years. This is in nominal terms, i.e. not adjusted for inflation. Its an audacious goal if you consider the fact that agriculture growth (in real terms) has never averaged more than five per cent over any continuous five-year period, in recent history. Thats because of two reasons.Firstly, agricultural productivity cannot rise steeply year after year, and secondly the area under cultivation cannot expand rapidly and continuously. Modest increase is possible, but not exponential. Besides, prices may remain stable, denying any nominal rupee gains. In addition to all this are the risks associated with agriculture, which are monsoon failure, pest attacks, spurious seeds, adverse weather shocks, etc., all of which contribute to making the goal truly audacious.But if you read the Prime Ministers goal carefully, you will notice that it is to double the farmers income, not agricultural production per se. Hence it is possible that the farmer may have some non-agricultural sources of income. Indeed, the services sector activities in rural areas have been increasing substantially, providing livelihoods to many. But more importantly, what if we increased the share of the overall national income pie that accrues to the farmer? It is this approach that holds the greatest promise of increasing incomes to the farmer.There are two aspects to the incomes associated with the food and cash crop economies. First, in case of fruits and vegetables, the difference between what the city dweller pays for the tomatoes, and what the farmer actually receives is huge. City folk pay four times the cost, attributable to reasons like transport, losses, entry taxes and fat margins for middlemen. If some of these inefficiencies are removed, a larger share can go to the farmer. The dismantling of the provisions of the Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act in many states is ensuring the reduction of this gap. So also is the establishment of electronic national agriculture market. Any mechanism to connect buyers and sellers directly can benefit the farmer, as long as he retains some bargaining power.The other aspect of increasing income share to farmers, is through value added agriculture, namely agro-processing. This has immense potential. The groundnut may fetch only forty rupees a kilo to the farmer, but when it becomes masala coated peanuts in a fancy packaging, it fetches four hundred rupees a kilo. The same is true for oranges and orange juice, or bananas and banana chips. There is almost an infinite range of agro-processing products possible, which can retain freshness, flavour and taste of produce, through a combination of technologies like nitrogen or vacuum packing, or freeze-drying.Some of the products that have become very popular in a short time are wet idli mix, instant upma and noodles, fresh juices including pomegranate and lychees, jowar chips and so on. All of these products require investment, working capital, marketing, advertising and efficient distribution. The growth of conventional consumer food companies is an indication of the great potential. But the trick is to ensure that farmers garner a proportionate share of the increase in and income that comes from agro-processing.This is where the farmer producer organisations (FPOs) come in. These are hybrid organisations combining features of a shareholder-owned company and cooperatives. The FPO structure was formally introduced under Company Law, to enable farmers to become shareholders. This ensures they have clout and bargaining power when dealing with consumers, small or big (such as organised retail supermarket chains). If a farmer sells groundnuts to a buyer, then no sales tax, VAT or now GST is applicable. But if an FPO sells salted peanut packets then all kinds of taxes become applicable. This defeats the economic viability since profit margins are slim and overheads can be large, especially when the scale is small. It is here that policy intervention is needed to ensure healthy growth of FPOs around the country.Not all crops and agri-products are amenable to be produced within an FPO structure. The success of FPOs depends also on them holding their own against FMCG companies, assessing consumer tastes and preferences, ensuring quality and offering competitive pricing. But because the demand is so large, those FPOs that manage these challenges well are bound to increase the incomes of their shareholders, i.e. farmers, immensely.For far too long the farm sector was neglected or has suffered from muddled policies and inefficient implementation. By making the goal of doubling farmers income in five years, the PM has brought the right focus to the problem. In addition, well need investment in irrigation, better water management (another of the PMs slogan, more crop per drop), dismantling APMC-like shackles, more seamless connect between buyer and seller and proactive policies for FPOs to flourish.A good monsoon last year ensured that agriculture growth would be close to nine percent in the second half this fiscal. Some states like Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are reporting even higher, double-digit growth rates. Sub sectors like horticulture, dairy, livestock, show promise of high growth in incomes. While conventional policy push should continue and strengthen, we also need a push to ensure the profits from agroprocessing go predominantly to the farmer.

5922eea37be9e01fc7f5c05a,Non-veg fare? Only if you are a foreigner,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/non-veg-fare-only-if-you-are-a-foreigner/articleshow/58571263.cms,2017-05-08,,The Times Of India,"If you are not a foreigner , you will not be served non-vegetarian food at private hospitals in Ahmedabad. Hospitals, in general, are not known for serving appetizing meals . However, patients here face a different sort of problem, revealed a Mirror Check. Hospitals here force you to follow vegetarianism, especially if you are Indian. They either flatly refuse to serve non-vegetarian food to Indians, or ask you to shift to the international ward to get the fare of your choice. These same hospitals have no such restrictions for foreigners admitted there. In their defence, the hospitals claim that they serve vegetarian food to Indian patients 'to respect the sentiments of the majority', but make an exception for foreign patients 'as they aren't used to vegetarian food'.UN-FARE PRACTICE AT HOSPITALSMirror visited eight hospitals to check the ground reality. Of these, Sterling, Columbia Asia, Zydus, and SAL -- serve vegetarian fare to patients and their relatives. They also do not allow people to eat non-vegetarian food on the premises, even if it has been brought from home. Of the four remaining hospitals, CIMS and HCG serve non-vegetarian fare but only to foreign patients. They do not cook the food on the premises. Instead, they order it from eateries. At Apollo hospital, non-vegetarian food is prepared on the premises and served freely to foreign patients. Indians are served non-vegetarian food only if there is a ""medical requirement"". Non-vegetarian food is prepared and served to both Indian and foreign patients at Krishna Shalby, provided the Indian patients shift to the international wing of the hospital. None of these hospitals have issued or put up any official notification in this regard.Taking objection to the unfair treatment, bank officer J K Nair (49), whose wife was recently hospitalised, says, ""This is discrimination, plain and simple. We cannot be treated as second-grade people in our own country for something as rudimentary as our food choices. If hospitals think it is okay for a foreign patient to consume non-vegetarian food, what ground do they have to deny us the same option?"" Mohammed Jamaluddin (52), an engineer whose nephew has been hospitalised for the past 10 days, says, ""The hospital may not want to cook non-vegetarian food in its kitchen but they should at least allow us to bring it from home. We respect other people's feelings. We can eat it in a secluded corner or in our room with our relatives.I have been to hospitals in Mumbai and they do not have any such restrictions. No one should be deprived of the basic freedom to eat what they want."" Businessman Abbas Manji Pir Bhai also pointed out that such discrimination existed only here. ""My daughter was admitted to a hospital in Delhi for afew weeks. They offered non-vegetarian fare to all patients, whether Indian or foreign,"" says the 67-year-old. Satbir Singh (24), an engineer, believes food goes a long way in curing a patient as much as medicines do. ""Being a non-vegetarian, I know that chicken soup would make me feel much better than tomato soup would. So long as I am having it in my private space, it should not be a problem for anybody.""Meanwhile, hospitals claim they do not offer non-vegetarian fare to Indian patients out of respect. Dr Nikhil Lala, centre head of Sterling says, ""I see no need for our hospital to provide non-vegetarian food as it is not a medical need. We ensure that the patient's protein requirement is fulfilled through vegetarian food."" Bhanupratap Hada, operation head of Zydus confirms, ""We do not serve non-vegetarian food in our hospitals. We have our own kitchen and patients are not allowed food from outside."" SAL Hospital refused to issue an official statement, but clarifies that it serves only vegetarian food.Apollo hospital states, ""A variety of specialised meals, including non-vegetarian fare, are provided to our patients on the advice of our doctors and dieticians. We have separate kitchen and storage facilities for cooking vegetarian and non-vegetarian food items."" Dr Bharat Gadhvi, regional director of HCG Gujarat, admits that Indians and foreigners were offered separate fares at the hospital. ""We get nonvegetarian food from outside for international patients only. For the rest of the patients and their relatives everything is strictly vegetarian.""'80PER CENT PATIENTS ARE VEGETARIANS'On allowing non-vegetarian food only to foreigners, Dr Anish Chandarana, executive director of CIMS hospital clarifies, ""It is hard for international patients to sustain a vegetarian diet as they are not used to it. Hence, we get it for them from hotels. The reason why hospitals have adopted a vegetarian- only policy for Indians is because 80 per cent of patients tend to be vegetarian and they may have a very strong emotional reaction to people who eat non-vegetarian food around them."" Explaining why Indian patients have to be shifted to another wing if they want to have non-vegetarian fare, Shanay Vikram Shah, director of Shalby hospitals says, ""We have a separate kitchen on the top floor for non-vegetarian food. The international wing is located on the floor below it and all the patients there are provided non-vegetarian food. If there are any Indian patients who need non-vegetarian fare, they can have it after shifting to the international wing.""DIFFERENT CITIES, DIFFERENT POLICIESInterestingly, some hospitals which have branches in Ahmedabad as well as other cities have policies that differ according to the city it is in. For example, Columbia Asia of Ahmedabad allows only vegetarian but their Bangalore branch has no restrictions upon non-vegetarian food. Gaurav Anand, general manager of Columbia Asia, confirms they allow ""only vegetarian"" food in the hospital. However, Pratyush Srivastava, general manager of Columbia Asia Hospital at Whitefield in Bangalore says, ""We serve non-vegetarian food to patients and their kin. We do not allow outside food in the hospital.The food served here is prepared in our kitchen as per guidelines from the dietician."" A hospital has every right to institute rules, but then it should be implemented without discrimination, avers designer Reuben Vaz (23). ""If their policy is pro-vegetarian, then it should be the same for everyone. If the Indians are not being provided non-vegetarian food, then foreigners should not be provided the same. It is not like foreigners have never had vegetarian food in their entire lives. It shouldn't be a problem for them to survive on it for a few days. People should not be divided based on their food choices,"" he says.","if you are not a foreigner , you will not be served non-vegetarian food at private hospitals in ahmedabad. hospitals, in general, are not known for serving appetizing meals . however, patients here face a different sort of problem, revealed a mirror check. hospitals here force you to follow vegetarianism, especially if you are indian. they either flatly refuse to serve non-vegetarian food to indians, or ask you to shift to the international ward to get the fare of your choice. these same hospitals have no such restrictions for foreigners admitted there. in their defence, the hospitals claim that they serve vegetarian food to indian patients 'to respect the sentiments of the majority', but make an exception for foreign patients 'as they aren't used to vegetarian food'.un-fare practice at hospitalsmirror visited eight hospitals to check the ground reality. of these, sterling, columbia asia, zydus, and sal -- serve vegetarian fare to patients and their relatives. they also do not allow people to eat non-vegetarian food on the premises, even if it has been brought from home. of the four remaining hospitals, cims and hcg serve non-vegetarian fare but only to foreign patients. they do not cook the food on the premises. instead, they order it from eateries. at apollo hospital, non-vegetarian food is prepared on the premises and served freely to foreign patients. indians are served non-vegetarian food only if there is a ""medical requirement"". non-vegetarian food is prepared and served to both indian and foreign patients at krishna shalby, provided the indian patients shift to the international wing of the hospital. none of these hospitals have issued or put up any official notification in this regard.taking objection to the unfair treatment, bank officer j k nair (49), whose wife was recently hospitalised, says, ""this is discrimination, plain and simple. we cannot be treated as second-grade people in our own country for something as rudimentary as our food choices. if hospitals think it is okay for a foreign patient to consume non-vegetarian food, what ground do they have to deny us the same option?"" mohammed jamaluddin (52), an engineer whose nephew has been hospitalised for the past 10 days, says, ""the hospital may not want to cook non-vegetarian food in its kitchen but they should at least allow us to bring it from home. we respect other people's feelings. we can eat it in a secluded corner or in our room with our relatives.i have been to hospitals in mumbai and they do not have any such restrictions. no one should be deprived of the basic freedom to eat what they want."" businessman abbas manji pir bhai also pointed out that such discrimination existed only here.

5922f6277be9e01fc7f5c813,Villagers around Koradi eat and breathe fly ash,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/villagers-around-koradi-eat-and-breathe-fly-ash/articleshow/58387105.cms,2017-04-27,,The Times Of India,"Driving a motorcycle is a risky business in Suradevi, a village 3km away from the Thermal Power Station at Koradi (KTPS). With the wind comes clouds of fly-ash in the village, blurring the vision.The effects of pollution starts from a radius of at least 10km from the plant  from the hems of Nagpur city  but it intensifies as you cross villages and move towards the plant. The damage is not just restricted to health but also crops and drinking water.Last week, TOI reported about environmentalists questioning the all-is-well air quality monitoring data of Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and Mahagenco, that runs KTPS. While both agencies boast of low emissions of total particulate matter (TPM)  a total of hazardous particles suspended in air  scores of villagers living around the plant are suffering since years. And the three new units, which were dedicated to the nation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 14, have only added to their woes.""We are virtually forced to breathe, eat and drink fly ash. The vegetables that are growing in the fields are covered with it. If we keep papads to dry or a bucket of water outside, they get coated with a layer of ash,"" says Rekha Kautare , a Suradevi resident.The fly-ash-coated vegetables grown at Koradi are consumed by Nagpurians too as they are sold in the city. ""There is a steady flow of vegetables throughout the year from villages around Koradi. They are washed at source point itself as the people will not buy such vegetables. They also have less shelf life,"" said Suresh Jawande, a vegetable wholesaler at Cotton Market.Till a few years ago, the villagers here would grow a variety of leafy vegetables, tomatoes and other greens. ""Since last year, we have stopped growing them because the quality and quantity was not good. Many times, our crops wilt due to high deposition of fly-ash. If our yield in normal conditions should have been 75%, now it is only 30-35%,"" says Ramesh Kawde, a farmer of the same village.In 2012, TOI had visited Lonkhairi and nearby villages where crops were damaged by fly-ash. A joint survey was done by Mahagenco and agriculture department officials. The report submitted by them stated that the damage had occurred but talks of compensation allegedly remains on paper.That time, villagers growing oranges had said that they will chop down the trees if fly-ash problem was not solved.Today, many have done it in surrounding villages. ""Some villagers had orange orchards. The fly-ash used to get heavily deposited on the flowers and the fruits wouldn't grow. Yields went down by half and therefore, they decided to chop down the trees,"" says Gunvanta Raut, former sarpanch of Ghogali village, located 5-6km from KTPS.Sanjay Bhoyar, professor of soil science at Dr Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth (PKV), who has done a PhD on use of fly-ash in agriculture, says that fly-ash deposition is extremely harmful for the crops. ""It gets deposited on hydrathodes of leaves affecting the transpiration process and thus, hampering photosynthesis,"" he told TOI.Bhoyar further says that if the electro-static precipitators (ESPs) function properly, then the emissions should go down by 99.99%. ""If ESPs are not functioning properly, then Mahagenco authorities should take immediate remedial steps,"" he added.Bhoyar rued that even though Mahagenco's predecessor MSEB had been told that use of wet fly-ash was good for agriculture, no steps had been taken by the authorities.Crop damage can be seen but the bigger damage is to the health, which is not fully visible right now. ""My mother-in-law is suffering from asthma since last few years and my son repeatedly suffers from cough and cold. Five months ago, an old woman in our village died of an asthma attack,"" says Kautare.Respiratory problems and other health ailments have been haunting the villagers since last many years. TOI visited five villages within 10km of KTPS where residents complained of health problems due to air pollution. Surprisingly, none of these most-affected villages are chosen for air quality monitoring by MPCB or Mahagenco. The list of villages where monitoring was done was provided to TOI by MPCB.Dr Gyaneshwar Dhanole , a medical practitioner in Mahadula, another village close to KTPS, concurs with the villagers. ""Respiratory ailments are common in the area. Those who fall prey to them are unable to recuperate completely. While in other places kids get viral fever mostly when season changes. However, here they suffer from it all the year round,"" he says.Even a village like Bailwada, which is some 10km from the plant, suffers from KTPS pollution. ""Our crop yield has reduced by 20% due to fly-ash. Asthma is a common problem. Every morning, we find our utensils, vehicles, in fact everything, covered with a thick layer of dry ash,"" says resident Rishi Dakhore.While Mahagenco claims that it holds health camps in the affected villages, residents said that the company had held an eye check-up camp. ""They have never held a camp for overall health,"" was the common refrain of residents of the villages TOI visited.Dr Sanjay Jaiswal, deputy director of health (Nagpur), says that no health camps are held. ""We have primary health centres (PHCs) in villages where people can go for treatment,"" he adds. However, most villagers prefer to go to private hospitals in Koradi and Nagpur as ""PHCs do not give prompt service.""In an earlier clarification sent to TOI, Mahagenco had denied ill-effects of air pollution on the ground that there was no such data with the PHCs. Since no camps were held, there is no data too.If crop damage and air pollution was not enough, KTPS is also polluting drinking water in many villages. ""Mahagenco releases water through a canal near our village. Sometimes oil flows with water and pollutes our groundwater. When we complain, the officials just take perfunctory steps to solve the problem,"" says Maharoti Bhange from Ghogli.A TOI photographer attempted to drink the well water but was unable to do so because of the atrocious taste.Bhoyar says, ""If the ESPs don't work properly, mercury is emitted, which oxidizes and converts into mercury oxide. When it gets dissolves in water and enters the food chain through fish, it is very dangerous for the nervous system of humans.""Frequent flooding, especially during monsoons is another curse of the plant for Ghogli villagers. ""Water from Totladoh collects in a pond near our village which is then transported to the plant through a canal. This canal is not de-silted regularly which results in flooding,"" says sarpanch of the village Gajanan Wankhede.Even though Mahagenco admitted to the problem after complaints made by Wankhede, the company has not taken up rehabilitation work under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). This is evident from an internal communication between two chief engineers through a letter on October 30, 2015. ""The buildings in the village should be shifted as per the directions of sub-divisional officer (SDO) under CSR,"" the letter states.""Our records on CSR activities run into voluminous pages and cannot be provided over mail or phone,"" a KTPS official told TOI.Meanwhile, Nagpur city is also feeling the effects pollution. When activist Ankita Shah recently shared TOI's story about KTPS pollution on the social media, Nagpurians complained that the pollution has reached city's northern areas. ""A friend complains that he has his office at Nelson Square, and if windows are left open for half-an-hour, he gets asthma attack,"" commented Deepanshu Khirwadkar.Madhurita Dhar, a resident of Mankapur, says, ""Residents living on higher floors are constantly exposed to dry ash. If we don't do dusting every day, a thick layer gets deposited on everything.""Based on TOI's reports, Shah has filed a complained with the PMO which has asked the member secretary of the pollution control board to file an action taken report within 15 days, which is before April 30. Some environmentalists see this as a meaningless exercise.""The pollution control board's figures were shockingly lower than the norms, which is well-nigh impossible,"" said Kaustav Chatterjee, member of an NGO which works in the green sector. ""The MPCB cannot be expected to conduct an enquiry on itself.""","driving a motorcycle is a risky business in suradevi, a village 3km away from the thermal power station at koradi (ktps). with the wind comes clouds of fly-ash in the village, blurring the vision.the effects of pollution starts from a radius of at least 10km from the plant  from the hems of nagpur city  but it intensifies as you cross villages and move towards the plant. the damage is not just restricted to health but also crops and drinking water.last week, toi reported about environmentalists questioning the all-is-well air quality monitoring data of maharashtra pollution control board (mpcb) and mahagenco, that runs ktps. while both agencies boast of low emissions of total particulate matter (tpm)  a total of hazardous particles suspended in air  scores of villagers living around the plant are suffering since years. and the three new units, which were dedicated to the nation by prime minister narendra modi on april 14, have only added to their woes.""we are virtually forced to breathe, eat and drink fly ash. the vegetables that are growing in the fields are covered with it. if we keep papads to dry or a bucket of water outside, they get coated with a layer of ash,"" says rekha kautare , a suradevi resident.the fly-ash-coated vegetables grown at koradi are consumed by nagpurians too as they are sold in the city.

""respiratory ailments are common in the area. those who fall prey to them are unable to recuperate completely. while in other places kids get viral fever mostly when season changes. however, here they suffer from it all the year round,"" he says.even a village like bailwada, which is some 10km from the plant, suffers from ktps pollution. ""our crop yield has reduced by 20% due to fly-ash. asthma is a common problem. every morning, we find our utensils, vehicles, in fact everything, covered with a thick layer of dry ash,"" says resident rishi dakhore.while mahagenco claims that it holds health camps in the affected villages, residents said that the company had held an eye check-up camp. ""they have never held a camp for overall health,"" was the common refrain of residents of the villages toi visited.dr sanjay jaiswal, deputy director of health (nagpur), says that no health camps are held. ""we have primary health centres (phcs) in villages where people can go for treatment,"" he adds. however, most villagers prefer to go to private hospitals in koradi and nagpur as ""phcs do not give prompt service.""in an earlier clarification sent to toi, mahagenco had denied ill-effects of air pollution on the ground that there was no such data with the phcs. since no camps were held, there is no data too.if crop damage and air pollution was not enough, ktps is also polluting drinking water in many villages. ""mahagenco releases water through a canal near our village. sometimes oil flows with water and pollutes our groundwater. when we complain, the officials just take perfunctory steps to solve the problem,"" says maharoti bhange from ghogli.a toi photographer attempted to drink the well water but was unable to do so because of the atrocious taste.bhoyar says, ""if the esps don't work properly, mercury is emitted, which oxidizes and converts into mercury oxide. when it gets dissolves in water and enters the food chain through fish, it is very dangerous for the nervous system of humans.""frequent flooding, especially during monsoons is another curse of the plant for ghogli villagers. ""water from totladoh collects in a pond near our village which is then transported to the plant through a canal. this canal is not de-silted regularly which results in flooding,"" says sarpanch of the village gajanan wankhede.even though mahagenco admitted to the problem after complaints made by wankhede, the company has not taken up rehabilitation work under corporate social responsibility (csr). this is evident from an internal communication between two chief engineers through a letter on october 30, 2015. ""the buildings in the village should be shifted as per the directions of sub-divisional officer (sdo) under csr,"" the letter states.""our records on csr activities run into voluminous pages and cannot be provided over mail or phone,"" a ktps official told toi.meanwhile, nagpur city is also feeling the effects pollution. when activist ankita shah recently shared toi's story about ktps pollution on the social media, nagpurians complained that the pollution has reached city's northern areas. ""a friend complains that he has his office at nelson square, and if windows are left open for half-an-hour, he gets asthma attack,"" commented deepanshu khirwadkar.madhurita dhar, a resident of mankapur, says, ""residents living on higher floors are constantly exposed to dry ash. if we don't do dusting every day, a thick layer gets deposited on everything.""based on toi's reports, shah has filed a complained with the pmo which has asked the member secretary of the pollution control board to file an action taken report within 15 days, which is before april 30. some environmentalists see this as a meaningless exercise.""the pollution control board's figures were shockingly lower than the norms, which is well-nigh impossible,"" said kaustav chatterjee, member of an ngo which works in the green sector. ""the mpcb cannot be expected to conduct an enquiry on itself."""

As per the recently published State Focus paper of Nabard, the entire produce which goes as waste has the potential for setting up of fruits and vegetable processing units.The major produce of the state, which is known as the fruit bowl of India, includes grapes, mangoes, pomegranates etc. The regions of Pune, Nashik, Satara Kolhapur, Sangli, etc are known for their extensive vegetable cultivation.

Nabards report says that about 70 per cent of fruits and 60 per cent of vegetables are consumed fresh in the state and hardly 1.2 per cent of fruits and vegetables are processed.Shriram Gadhve, president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India (VGAI), said the wastage of fruits and vegetables starts right from the field gate and continues till the retail market. Gadhve said that the lack of knowledge at the farmers end and the untrained market labours compound the wastage. Losses in transit are also encountered which often goes unaccounted for, he said. At the farmers end, Gadhve said, the lack of proper pricing hinders the adoption of proper handling techniques while at the market the labours employed are not trained properly in handling techniques.The usual practice for fruits and vegetable growers is to hire a vehicle to take their produce to the market from where it is unloaded and sold. Traders often cite lower prices to compensate for lower grade or wastage in the consignment. Gadhve said losses are more in case of soft vegetables like tomatoes and green leafy vegetables. The lack of storage or air-conditioned vans also contributed to the losses, he said.Gadhve said they had started awareness campaigns at the farmers end to educate them about proper handling and packing techniques.

Bhise, who normally plants five acres of tomatoes, has only planted three acres of the crop this year.

593adf067be9e01228650609,Devendra Fadnavis sees 'political hand' behind farmers' strike in Maharashtra,http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/devendra-fadnavis-sees-political-hand-behind-farmers-strike-in-maharashtra/story-5eAMkiyS2Bo6YtEveYEvsM.html,2017-06-07,,Hindustan Times,"As the farmers strike continued on the sixth day, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday alleged there were political motives behind the protests.Fadnavis said he had information that political workers and not farmers were involved in the recent violent incidents such as shutting the agricultural markets and blocking supply of essential commodities to cities across Maharashtra.As the farmers outfits are planning to intensify their agitation, the state government issued prohibitory orders in Pune, Nashik and Kolhapur districts  where protests are most intense  to ban the assembly of five or more people.Mumbai, however, remains unaffected.Farmers outfits in Maharashtra have been protesting since June 1, demanding a farm loan waiver and protection from falling prices of agricultural commodities.On Saturday, Fadnavis declared a Rs30,000 crore farm loan waiver for 31 lakh farmers, to come into effect from October 31. But a section of farmers outfits is not happy and want loans of all 1.34 crore farmers in the state to be written off. The demand is supported by Opposition parties and the BJPs main ally, the Shiv Sena. Significantly, two influential farmers outfits, the late Sharad Joshi-founded Shetkari Sanghatana and MP Raju Shetti-led Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, have decided to jump into the agitation. Shetti is an ally of the BJP. A 21-member core committee of prominent farmers leaders in the state has been formed, which will be meeting on June 8 in Nashik to decide on a future course of the agitation.Anticipating trouble and in the backdrop of the violence in neighbouring MP on a same issue, the state governments orders that prohibit five or more people from assembling at a spot will remain in effect till June 16 in Pune, June 17 in Kolhapur and June 19 in Nashik.In Mumbai, the vegetable markets received regular supply and prices stablised on Tuesday. The rates of tomato dipped to Rs40 a dozen, while cauliflower was priced at Rs 60 a kilogram.

It is better if they resort to a peaceful way of protest,"" Hazare told reporters.The Gandhian's appeal for peaceful protest came against the backdrop of farmers' agitation turning violent in some parts of the state with incidents of stone pelting and vandalising of vehicles carrying milk and vegetables to Mumbai being reported on Wednesday night.Appealing to farmers to shun violence, Hazare said he was ready to join discussions between the farmers' leaders and Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis if he was asked to.Yesterday, Fadnavis expressed willingness to hold talks with the agitating farmers.""'Satyagraha' is a birthright of all. The government should not use police force when there is a peaceful agitation,"" he said.The septuagenarian alleged that farmers have resorted to protests due to ""anti-farmer"" policies of the government.""Farmers must get an assurance on price of their agricultural produce based on expenses incurred by them on production. This demand has always been neglected by all the past governments,"" the anti-graft crusader said.A non-political movement of farmers is necessary to pressurise the whole political system to meet the demands of farmers, he said.""If farmers' leaders wish so, I am ready to initiate a dialogue with farmers and the government,"" Hazare said.However, farmers in Nashik district hit back at Hazare over his appeal for peaceful protests.Speaking to a regional television channel, Ramesh Chougule, a farmer from Nashik said, ""When farmers were committing suicides, Anna never uttered a word for the families of those farmers. ""Therefore, now when they are protesting for their rights, he should not interfere. What is wrong in asking for our rights of getting better returns for our produce.""Ravindra Bhasme, another farmer from Satana tehsil in Nashik said, ""I am a part of farmers' group and we produce leafy vegetables and fruit vegetables to supply to Mumbai.""We have decided not to harvest it and support the strike. We will not send our vegetables to Mumbai so that the government will feel the heat.""He also said that the social activist had been selective when it came to farmers' issues. ""Hazare should have been with us from the beginning,"" he added.Farmers from many parts of the state including Nashik, Pune and Ahmednagar districts have joined the stir, which entered the second day today.The agitation is mainly spearheaded by farmers' activists though parties like the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna, led by Raju Shetti, an ally of the ruling BJP, have extended moral support to the stir.

Bas, mag kaay tension? says the wiry lady, sitting ramrod straight with a sparkle in her eyes on an easy couch at their flat, wearing one of her favourite green saris as mediapersons troop in and out of the drawing room of the Jadhav house.The Jadhavs are part of a strictly middle-class neighbourhood off Paud Road in Pune  theres a girni (flour mill) around the corner, the clean pathway leading upto the four-storey apartment (where Jadhavs own two adjoining flats on one floor) is lined with trees and two wheelers alike.

We never talk about cricket a day before his matches, and hes also very relaxed.Nothing fazes him, says sister Sucheta. Our father always had leadership qualities and has a confident personality. Every single person in the family is capable of handling biggest problems and weve always faced challenges headlong.

He never liked studies much, and he was always good at cricket. The good thing was though he would disappear for hours on end to play, he would always tell us where he was going. No sneaking away, no secrets, says eldest sister Charusheela.A 80m long rectangular pebble strewn playground  with a neat joggers walkway around it in the adjoining Lokmanya Nagar was where Kedar started his cricket. Its called the Jeet ground, though the original three-storey Jeet building facing the ground after which the tiny maidan took its name was razed down for redevelopment.

593bec567be9e04956d79822,A bumper farm crisis,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-bumper-farm-crisis/article18470885.ece,2017-05-17,,The Hindu,"Farmers in some States are regretting their abundant yields this year as the prices of agricultural commodities have crashed. Chilli farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, tomato growers in Karnataka, and toor dal cultivators in Maharashtra are at the centre of a severe crisis that has witnessed prices fall by more than half in a matter of just weeks. Some speculate that high commodity prices last year caused farmers to respond by boosting production, which in turn led to the present price crash.Whether it is the wholesale mandi s where farmers sell their agricultural produce, or retail outlets where consumers buy them, price fluctuations are common. But whether such fluctuations can be explained as being due to mindless crop cultivation, as some speculate, is not as certain. For one, in the consumer market, commodity speculators usually dampen price fluctuations by managing supply according to consumer demand. For instance, when the supply of grains is abundant, speculators do not flood the market with all their stock but instead hoard the grains and sell them later when supply turns scarce. Thus, even if farmers engage in mindless grain production, speculators usually save the day for consumers by preventing steep rises and falls in grain prices.Price fluctuationsSecond, in the wholesale market, speculators can save farmers from similar price fluctuations by paying a competitive price for their produce even when there is abundant supply. Grain traders, to return to our previous example, who want to hoard supply expecting higher grain prices in the future would be willing to pay a better price to farmers today. This comes not out of compassion for farmers, but purely out of competition with other grain traders. When farmers are free to sell their produce to any trader they want, it is traders paying the best price who get hold of it. Farmers can also expect a more predictable price for their produce each season, reflecting stable consumer prices, thus preventing mindless cultivation.Such competition though is precisely what is missing from the Indian agricultural scene where the supply chain is broken. Red tape, including limits on stocking agricultural products, has prevented the growth of a robust market for commodity speculation. The result is lack of investment in infrastructure like that of cold storage; about 40% of agricultural produce in India is wasted because of it. This, in turn, has led to price fluctuations that have affected both the farmer and the consumer. Wholesale agricultural prices are determined by trader cartels that block competitive bidding. This significantly reduces the price farmers can get for their products, while boosting the profits of some privileged traders. By some estimates, farmers receive only 20-25% of what the final consumer pays for his product. Thus, a free market in agriculture can be the best antidote to the crisis facing Indian farmers.","farmers in some states are regretting their abundant yields this year as the prices of agricultural commodities have crashed. chilli farmers in andhra pradesh and telangana, tomato growers in karnataka, and toor dal cultivators in maharashtra are at the centre of a severe crisis that has witnessed prices fall by more than half in a matter of just weeks. some speculate that high commodity prices last year caused farmers to respond by boosting production, which in turn led to the present price crash.whether it is the wholesale mandi s where farmers sell their agricultural produce, or retail outlets where consumers buy them, price fluctuations are common. but whether such fluctuations can be explained as being due to mindless crop cultivation, as some speculate, is not as certain. for one, in the consumer market, commodity speculators usually dampen price fluctuations by managing supply according to consumer demand. for instance, when the supply of grains is abundant, speculators do not flood the market with all their stock but instead hoard the grains and sell them later when supply turns scarce. thus, even if farmers engage in mindless grain production, speculators usually save the day for consumers by preventing steep rises and falls in grain prices.price fluctuationssecond, in the wholesale market, speculators can save farmers from similar price fluctuations by paying a competitive price for their produce even when there is abundant supply. grain traders, to return to our previous example, who want to hoard supply expecting higher grain prices in the future would be willing to pay a better price to farmers today. this comes not out of compassion for farmers, but purely out of competition with other grain traders. when farmers are free to sell their produce to any trader they want, it is traders paying the best price who get hold of it. farmers can also expect a more predictable price for their produce each season, reflecting stable consumer prices, thus preventing mindless cultivation.such competition though is precisely what is missing from the indian agricultural scene where the supply chain is broken. red tape, including limits on stocking agricultural products, has prevented the growth of a robust market for commodity speculation. the result is lack of investment in infrastructure like that of cold storage; about 40% of agricultural produce in india is wasted because of it. this, in turn, has led to price fluctuations that have affected both the farmer and the consumer. wholesale agricultural prices are determined by trader cartels that block competitive bidding. this significantly reduces the price farmers can get for their products, while boosting the profits of some privileged traders. by some estimates, farmers receive only 20-25% of what the final consumer pays for his product. thus, a free market in agriculture can be the best antidote to the crisis facing indian farmers."

Farmers are demanding loan waivers and remunerative prices for all crops, many of them encouraged by Uttar Pradeshs decision to write off loans given to small farmers. The governments of Maharashtra and Punjab, where the protests are spreading, have rightly resisted because loan waivers only offer relief that is usually exhausted in two farming seasons.The cardinal malaise lies in successive governments treating agriculture as a source of votes and not an engine of growth. That kept the rural-urban wage gap wide at 45%, almost four times that of China, and shrunk the share of farming in GDP to under 14%, although more than half of Indias 1.25 billion people still depend on it.To be sure, India is reforming parts of its economy. But not farming. If farmers are to escape poverty, farming needs to become more like manufacturing: Teched up operations, free as far as possible from imponderables, churning out quality produce that fetch the right price.For this, things need to change. The old, labour-intensive methods must give way to technology for efficiency and higher yield; Pricing and subsidy mechanism must be overhauled; and, most importantly, India must look at fewer people farming.For far too long, farming has been at the mercy of nature, especially the June-September monsoon rain. The use of technology is patchy, and only one-tenth of every rupee the government spends on rural areas goes to improving productivity  which is why farmers in India grow 46% less rice an acre than their Chinese counterparts.Our farm subsidy policy encourages the production of only low-value staples, such as rice and wheat, and the output of fruits and vegetables  that more Indians are eating and farmers producing  is not covered by the governments minimum support price. Much of the farm distress sweeping India now stemmed from a glut of potatoes, onion and tomatoes.Worse, the monopoly of traders over local agricultural markets is perpetuated by law, which bars farmers from selling directly to consumers. This kills any chance of farmers getting a fair price, lining the pockets of commission agents instead.In the past, a single season of dry spell was enough to send the economy into recession. Now failed monsoons trigger localised distress. Thats an improvement. Still, far too many farm households remain too poor.

A shortage of cash because of demonetisation. Despite Rs 3.5 lakh crore  enough to build 545 Tehri-sized dams  invested over six decades to 2011, more than half of all farms depend on rains. These are the three factors agitating Indians who depend on farming  90 million families, or 54.6% of Indias 1.2 billion people.As anger sweeps rural Madhya Pradesh after the death of six farmers in police firing, farm protests roil rural Maharashtra -- wholesale markets are shut, produce is being dumped on streets -- and governments of the debt-ridden states struggle to respond to demands for loan waivers, an IndiaSpend analysis and reportage from rural Maharashtra explores why farmers are both angry and desperate.The primary reason farming is unviable in India is that farms are now among the worlds smallest (the global average land-holding size is 5.5 hectares)  too many people are dependent on shrinking farms.Since 1951, the per capita availability of land has declined by 70%, from 0.5 hectares to 0.15 hectares in 2011, and is likely to decline further, according to ministry of agriculture data.Such small and marginal land-holdings, as they are called, now constitute 85% of the number of operational farms in the country, according this 2015-16 report on the state of Indian agriculture.It is hard to use modern machinery on small farms, the owners of which are often too poor to afford farm equipment. Manual labour increases costs, but labour too has been in short supply, as workers migrate to cities. Further, their size and output limits access to loans and institutional credit.Those are the larger issues. Here are the three reasons for the current turmoil, gleaned by IndiaSpends analysts and reporters:1. After back-to-back droughts, a good harvest, but incomes fallAs 2017 rolled in, the news from Indias farms appeared good.After droughts in 2014 and 2015, a good monsoon in 2016 reversed two years of rural economic decline. Indias agricultural growth contracted 0.2% in 2014-15 and grew no more than 1.2% in 2015-16, because of the back-to-back droughts. In 2016-17, the agricultural economy grew 4.1%.Across many states growing pulses, such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Gujarat, markets were flooded with produce, especially tur (pigeon pea), which witnessed the highest growth among all pulses, an important source of protein for a majority of Indians. India is the worlds largest pulses producer.However, an influx of pulses from Myanmar, Tanzania, Mozambique and Malawigrowing 20% over two financial quarters, from September 2016 to March 2017, the Business Standard reported on March 3, 2017caused the price of Indian tur to plunge.From Rs 11,000 per quintal (from December 2015), the price of tur fell 63% to Rs 3,800-4,000 per quintal  20% below the minimum support price (MSP)the price at which government buys farm produceof Rs 5,050 per quintal (including a bonus of Rs 425) since December 2016 as Indiaspend reported on April 12, 2017.The table above explains how production of pulses rose 29%, from 17.15 million tonnes in 2014-15 to 22.14 million tonnes in 2016-17. Tur production increased 50%, from 2.81 million tonnes to 4.23 million tonnes, over the same period.The MSP for tur should be increased to Rs 6,000 per quintal in 2017 and Rs 7,000 per quintal in 2018, a government committee headed by chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian recommended in September 2016.As on March 2017, the minimum support price for tur was Rs 5,050 per quintal, nearly 20% (18%) lower than the prices recommended by the committee on pulses.As these prices crashed, farmers found it harder to find money to store their produce and prepare for the next season because demonetisationthe withdrawal of 86% of Indias currency, by value, on November 2016 left them starved of cash.2. How demonetisation  and government red tape  left farmers short of cashOn May 18, at around noon, 30-year-old Prashant Lande waited under a harsh summer sun to sell 800 quintals of tur at the Amravati agricultural produce market committee (APMC), 664 km east of Indias financial capital, Mumbai.From Kinhala village in Amravati districts Ashti taluka, in Maharashtras eastern region of Vidharbha, Lande said he refuses to sell his 800 quintals of tur to the government procurement centre, although the state buys tur at a higher rate.At the market, Lande could sell his tur at Rs 3,800 to Rs 4,000 per quintal, while the government buying centre offered Rs 5,050 per quintal.We dont sell to the government centre because the process of selling takes one month  from standing in line for the token to the sale to finally when the payment reaches the account, said Lande. Our fellow farmers who have sold their produce at the procurement centre on March 22, are yet to receive their payments and it is nearly June!It does not help that the effects of demonetisation continue to to be felt across the rural economy.Right after demonetisation, tomato farmers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, and onion farmers in Maharashtra and Gujarat, were the worst hit as prices fell by 60-85%, IndiaSpend reported on January 18, 2017.With little respite more than six months later, the experiment has aggravated the circumstances leading to the current farmers strike.By now we should have begun preparing our fields for the monsoons, but because of demonetisation and the unavailability of cash, we are still struggling to find money for sowing, said Lande.At such a time, farmers like Lande turn to credit.Up to 57% of farm families in Maharashtra are indebted; the figure for India is 52%, according to the National Sample Survey Organisations 2013 situation assessment survey of farm households, the latest available data.This indebtedness has widespread consequences. More farmers committed suicide in Maharashtra (4,291) in 2015 than any other state, rising 7% from 4,004 in 2014, followed by Karnataka (1,569) and Telangana (1,400), as IndiaSpend previously reported in January 2017.Now, after Uttar Pradeshs new government waived Rs 30,792 crore of farm loans, pressure is building on the governments of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to do the same. Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has been reluctant to do so, but with his governments coalition partner, the Shiv Sena, and other parties preparing for a political agitation, he may find it hard to exercise fiscal prudence.3. In an era of climate change, 52% of Indian farmers without irrigationThe basic problem across most of rural India is that despite the spread of irrigationa sector plagued by unfinished projects and corruption52% of Indias farms still depend on the vagaries of rain, which is becoming increasingly uncertain in an era of climate change.Extreme rainfall events in central India, the core of the monsoon system, are increasing and moderate rainfall is decreasing  as a part of complex changes in local and world weather  according to a clutch of Indian and global studies, as IndiaSpend reported on April 15, 2015.The droughts of 2014 and 2015 in rural Maharashtra were mitigated by the plentiful rains of 2016, but many parts of the state also endured floods. Uncertain weather affects the ability of government extension systems to provide accurate advice to farmers.The government encouraged us to grow more tur in the kharif (July to October) season, since these crops consume less water and are in high demand, said Lande, the Vidarbha farmer. We would not have faced so much loss over the last three years, had there been a proper system of canals.Despite six decades of irrigation, less than 50% (or 66 million hectares of Indias net-cultivated area of 140 million hectares) as irrigated, according to the 2015-16 State of Agriculture report. Groundwater provides water for two-thirds of Indias irrigated land, but those levels are falling from overuse.From the first five year plan (1951-56) to the eleventh (2006 to 2011), the central government has spent a total of Rs 3.51 lakh crore, as we said, on major irrigation and flood control projects characterised by time and cost overruns, shows this 12th Five Year Plan (2012-2017) report.On July 1, 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY)or the Prime Ministers Farmers Irrigation Programmewith a budget of Rs. 50,000 crores over five years (2015-16 to 2019). The motto of the PMKSY is Har Khet Ko Pani (water to every field) and More crop per drop.In 2015-16, less than a third (Rs 312 crore) of Rs 1,000 crores set aside for micro-irrigation was released, reveals this government report. Of this, upto April 2016, no more than Rs 48.3 crore, or less than 5%, was actually spent, according this micro-irrigation financial progress monitoring report. The government set Rs 1,763 as the 2016-17 micro-irrigation target, but no data on results have been released.The micro-irrigation programme covers an area of 6,51,220 hectares, or 0.46% of net cultivated area.(Salve is an analyst with IndiaSpend.

short of cashon may 18, at around noon, 30-year-old prashant lande waited under a harsh summer sun to sell 800 quintals of tur at the amravati agricultural produce market committee (apmc), 664 km east of indias financial capital, mumbai.from kinhala village in amravati districts ashti taluka, in maharashtras eastern region of vidharbha, lande said he refuses to sell his 800 quintals of tur to the government procurement centre, although the state buys tur at a higher rate.at the market, lande could sell his tur at rs 3,800 to rs 4,000 per quintal, while the government buying centre offered rs 5,050 per quintal.we dont sell to the government centre because the process of selling takes one month  from standing in line for the token to the sale to finally when the payment reaches the account, said lande. our fellow farmers who have sold their produce at the procurement centre on march 22, are yet to receive their payments and it is nearly june!it does not help that the effects of demonetisation continue to to be felt across the rural economy.right after demonetisation, tomato farmers in karnataka and tamil nadu, and onion farmers in maharashtra and gujarat, were the worst hit as prices fell by 60-85%, indiaspend reported on january 18, 2017.with little respite more than six months later, the experiment has aggravated the circumstances leading to the current farmers strike.by now we should have begun preparing our fields for the monsoons, but because of demonetisation and the unavailability of cash, we are still struggling to find money for sowing, said lande.at such a time, farmers like lande turn to credit.up to 57% of farm families in maharashtra are indebted; the figure for india is 52%, according to the national sample survey organisations 2013 situation assessment survey of farm households, the latest available data.this indebtedness has widespread consequences. more farmers committed suicide in maharashtra (4,291) in 2015 than any other state, rising 7% from 4,004 in 2014, followed by karnataka (1,569) and telangana (1,400), as indiaspend previously reported in january 2017.now, after uttar pradeshs new government waived rs 30,792 crore of farm loans, pressure is building on the governments of maharashtra, madhya pradesh, tamil nadu and karnataka to do the same. maharashtra chief minister devendra fadnavis has been reluctant to do so, but with his governments coalition partner, the shiv sena, and other parties preparing for a political agitation, he may find it hard to exercise fiscal prudence.3. in an era of climate change, 52% of indian farmers without irrigationthe basic problem across most of rural india is that despite the spread of irrigationa sector plagued by unfinished projects and corruption52% of indias farms still depend on the vagaries of rain, which is becoming increasingly uncertain in an era of climate change.extreme rainfall events in central india, the core of the monsoon system, are increasing and moderate rainfall is decreasing  as a part of complex changes in local and world weather  according to a clutch of indian and global studies, as indiaspend reported on april 15, 2015.the droughts of 2014 and 2015 in rural maharashtra were mitigated by the plentiful rains of 2016, but many parts of the state also endured floods. uncertain weather affects the ability of government extension systems to provide accurate advice to farmers.the government encouraged us to grow more tur in the kharif (july to october) season, since these crops consume less water and are in high demand, said lande, the vidarbha farmer. we would not have faced so much loss over the last three years, had there been a proper system of canals.despite six decades of irrigation, less than 50% (or 66 million hectares of indias net-cultivated area of 140 million hectares) as irrigated, according to the 2015-16 state of agriculture report. groundwater provides water for two-thirds of indias irrigated land, but those levels are falling from overuse.from the first five year plan (1951-56) to the eleventh (2006 to 2011), the central government has spent a total of rs 3.51 lakh crore, as we said, on major irrigation and flood control projects characterised by time and cost overruns, shows this 12th five year plan (2012-2017) report.on july 1, 2015, prime minister narendra modi launched the pradhan mantri krishi sinchayee yojana (pmksy)or the prime ministers farmers irrigation programmewith a budget of rs. 50,000 crores over five years (2015-16 to 2019). the motto of the pmksy is har khet ko pani (water to every field) and more crop per drop.in 2015-16, less than a third (rs 312 crore) of rs 1,000 crores set aside for micro-irrigation was released, reveals this government report. of this, upto april 2016, no more than rs 48.3 crore, or less than 5%, was actually spent, according this micro-irrigation financial progress monitoring report. the government set rs 1,763 as the 2016-17 micro-irrigation target, but no data on results have been released.the micro-irrigation programme covers an area of 6,51,220 hectares, or 0.46% of net cultivated area.(salve is an analyst with indiaspend. saldanha is

But as soon as the sun sets, and the food is served, everyone is smiling and chatty. Eyes suddenly light up with gratitude and glee. You can hear some banter on one table and a child screaming with joy on the other.However, even if you arent fasting, rest assured that the lip-smacking food found in the hidden pockets of this area, abuzz with restaurants dishing out their signature preparations, will make your mouth water. Heres a glimpse of what to expect on your Iftar trail.Shami Kebab and Chicken HakimiNoor Mohammadi, Bhendi BazaarBhendi Bazaar is a busy nightspot through the year. Its especially busy during Ramzan. And the largest crowd is usually gathered at Noor Mohammadi, waiting to break their fast with falooda, fruits and some lip-smacking Shami Kebab (Rs 20). Made with minced chicken, chana dal and spices, the kebab is hand-pound to a texture so soft that it is hard to lift them without having them fall apart. Another specialty here is the Chicken Hakimi (Rs 500), essentially tandoori chicken soaked in a thin liquid concoction of buttermilk, chaat masala and butter.Bheja, Kaleji or Gurda MasalaBa-Barkat, Nagdevi StreetHere, your choice of meat, bheja (lamb brain), kaleji (lamb heart) or gurda (lamb kidney; Rs 180), is pound with some oil, tomatoes, onions, chillies and lemon juice to form a dish that has the consistency of egg bhurjee.Bhel Bara HandiSurti, Bohri MohallaLocated a stones throw away from Tawakkal Tandoori Chicken, Surti is famous for its Bara Handi, and sees huge crowds during Ramzan. The dish acquires its name from the 12 vessels that traditionally have different types of pulse-based gravies, each containing a different cut of mutton or tenderloin. The one served at Surti, however, is a banquet of seven gravies. While each of the gravies can be had by itself, a dish called the Bhel (Rs 150), which combines all the different gravies, is also served here. The ensuing gravy is a union of mutton, dal and garam masalas.Aab GoshtCafe Nizari, Bhendi BazarDunk some pillowy and slightly sour pav (Rs 7) into a bowlful of rich fiery mutton stew (Rs 70) primarily prepared with gram lentil, tomatoes and onions.Baida RotiMastan Talao, Nagdevi StreetA meal in itself, the Baida Roti (Rs 100) found at Nagdevi Street, is an Iftar must-have. A thick layer of minced keema or chicken is sandwiched between two hot and fluffy flour-based rotis that are coated with egg.Chicken TandooriTawakkal Tandoori Chicken, Nagdevi StreetThe Chicken Tandoori (Rs 110) served at the buzzy stall located on Nagpada Street is another local legend. Juicy and tender pieces are coated with a marination of your choice. The three varieties of tandoori are chicken malai (marinated in creamy yoghurt, ginger, garlic and chilli), hariyali (coated with a paste of coriander, mint leaves, ginger, garlic and lemon juice) and the regular chicken tikka masala.Reshmi Special MalpuaBadri Mithai, Nagdevi StreetWatching Reshmi Special Malpua (Rs160) being made is almost hypnotic. Batches of dough, prepared with maida, sugar, saffron, milk, cardamom, semolina, etc., are dipped in a vessel of hot oil and fried till the outsides of the dough turn golden brown and crisp.

593c73a37be9e00dabcb4ef3,Between mouthfuls of shawarma and baklava,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/between-mouthfuls-of-shawarma-and-baklava/article18263231.ece,2017-04-28,,The Hindu,"Chef Mohanad Alshamali, grew up inHoms, Syria. Being a homebound person by nature, I spent a lot of time in the kitchen helping my mother. Our food needs a lot of whisking, and she would ask me to stir the curries. She taught me how to make kibbeh, a mixture of finely ground lamb or beef, bulgur, onion, mint and Middle Eastern spices, which we would stuff in fish or lamb and fry, says Alshamali. The 35-year-old chef in the midst of launching a modern Middle Eastern cuisine eatery at the Renaissance Downtown Hotel, Dubai is in Mumbai to helm the ongoing Arabesque food festival at the J.W. Marriott Juhu.When we meet Alshamali, the Lotus Caf is pleasantly enveloped with the pleasing fragrance of zaatar and cinnamon. Middle Eastern food is similar to Indian food as most of the ingredients are similar, shares the chef. The food that Alshamali is dishing up for Arabesque is more home-style making it an authentic Arabic experience on a platter.On the menu is an authentic shawarma station. Alshamali is serving shawarmas with a special red chilli paste he has brought all the way from Syria. From the grill section, we try chicken in harissa sauce, prawns in a green souk sauce made from coriander and chillies. While the ingredients are easily identifiable, they create a completely unique zing on our palates. We quite enjoy the mild chicken cooked in yogurt with saffron.Past the grill section, which also has crunchy baby corns, green chillies and baby aubergines,we take a dollop of kabsa, rice with minced meat and meatball in tomato sauce made with pomegranate molasses, kokum and sumac, which gives the dish a berry-like sourness.The chef, whose earlier stint has been at Qbara, a modern Middle Eastern restaurant that made it to Worlds 50 Best Restaurants this year. He says, My first job in Dubai was in Atmosphere, the highest restaurant in the world housed in Burj Khalifa, where we served authentic French cuisine.He breaks down Arabic cuisine to the basics. Tahina is made from roasted sesame and harissa, a sauce made from Magrebi red chili, Moroccan spices and garlic, are the most commonly used. We also make a fine green zouk sauce which has coriander, green chillies, caraway seeds and lemon juice. We use pomegranate molasses and cumin too in our curries, he adds, sharing a childhood memory of his mother pickling vegetables for winter months. She would put the olives in brine solution for two months before we could eat it, he smiles.Our order of the shawarma is here, and we roll the pita bread that is stuffed with grilled chicken, the Syrian red chilli paste, lemon juice, onions. We dunk it in sour cream and the sweet and tangy red chilli paste pleasantly surprises us.

To start with, they seem to be concentrated in the relatively more prosperous agriculture belts  the stretch from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune to Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur in Western Maharashtra and Neemuch, Mandsaur and Ratlam in MPs Malwa region. Farmers here grow a range of commercial crops. They are also largely from progressive agricultural communities such as Marathas and Patidars.

But with a little care, you can remedy the situation. Firstly, moisturise as much as possible. Whether you are sitting in your car or in your office, always keep lotion handy. As for the men, while strong hands might be appealing, callused ones certainly arent. So use a hand cream too but just dont borrow one from your partner. Sonia Sharma, Spa Manager at Taj Salon, Vivanta by Taj - President, Mumbai, advises purchasing formulas meant for men as their skin tends to be thicker. While doing the dishes, use gloves to avoid contact with harsh detergents. Swap harsh soaps for gentle hand washes with pH levels between 5.5 to 5.7.Dr. Neena Chopra, director, Beauty and Technical, Just Herbs (an e-store for organic and ayurvedic luxury skincare) has simple advice.

Also, a hand mask once a week delivers an intensive dose of hydration to your skin. Dr. Renita Rajan, a consultant cosmetic dermatologist, offers a quick home-care facial for the hands. Lather up a gentle cleanser and add some brown sugar to the mix. Use the concoction to gently scrub the skin until the sugar dissolves. It will exfoliate your skin without being unduly harsh.Of course, never forget sunscreen, even for your hands. Dr. Neeraj Tulara, specialist internal medicine at Dr. L H Hiranandani Hospital, Powai says, Just like the rest of your skin, your hands are vulnerable to damage from the sun, including dark spots that can make them look older.

Whilst selecting your moisturiser, check the labels for key ingredients such as hyaluronic acid, niacinamide and dimethicone, besides urea, glycerine and shea butter as these will replenish the moisture that the environment takes out from your skin by pulling the water from the inner layers of your skin to the surface. Aloe vera, vitamin E oil, mango butters, also work well to soften and heal your hands. Dr.Chiranjiv Chhabra, director and consultant dermatologist at Skin Alive, recommends using a product with retinol at night since it has great anti-ageing benefits and stimulates collagen production.If you want to go beyond homecare, Dr. Apratim Goel, cosmetic dermatologist and laser surgeon, Cutis Skin Studio, Mumbai, suggests trying out the new Helios-II fractional laser, which works wonders on shrivelled hands and removes age spots and tanning.

593d6bb67be9e00dabcc0630,Glut ruins farmers trapped in ‘cobweb phenomenon’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/glut-ruins-farmers-trapped-in-cobweb-phenomenon/article18405819.ece,2017-05-08,,The Hindu,"Dashed hopesCrash in the prices of grapes has pushed the farmers of Maharashtra into deep despair.Special ArrangementIf it is tomatoes in Karnataka, it is red chillies in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, and tur and grapes in Maharashtra. An abundance of the produce has led to a crash in prices, dashing the hopes of farmers.While farmers in Kolar, Karnataka, dumped tomatoes on the road after the prices collapsed to a new low of Rs. 2 per kg last week from Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 a month ago, violent protests broke out in parts of Telangana after a good yield of the commodity in the two Telugu-speaking States brought down the prices from a high of Rs. 10,000 per quintal last year to a measly Rs. 2,500 this year.In Maharashtra, the demand for tur, which rode a wave of high prices last year, plummeted after its production went up from 4.44 lakh tonnes in 2015-16 to 20.35 lakh tonnes in 2016-17. So was the case of grapes after a crash in their prices plunged the vineyard owners across the State into despair.While most farmers complain about the poor remuneration for their produce in comparison to the prices that prevailed in the previous season, agricultural economists have traced the reasons for the glut and the resultant price crash to the cobweb phenomenon.After the prices of a particular agricultural commodity shoot through the roof during a season of scarcity, farmers resort to boosting the production on the premise of the pre-existing demand and prices, leading to a problem of plenty, reasoned Dr. R.S. Deshpande, former Director of the Institute of Social and Economic Change (ISEC), Bengaluru, explaining the cobweb phenomenon.Most of the agricultural products that have now suffered a price crash due to their abundance had yielded a rich dividend in the previous season.Chilli woesA long duration crop, consuming up to eight months for harvesting, red chilli cultivation was expanded in both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh this year after the commodity commanded a good price last year.However, in the absence of minimum support price for the crop, categorised as commercial, the market dynamics of demand-supply kept the price low from the beginning of arrivals in the market this season from April first week. As the top quality red chilli yielded a price of even Rs. 13,000 per quintal last year, the farming community had hopes of good returns this year too, a senior Telangana Agriculture Department official told The Hindu . But, it was not to be. The Centre has, however, announced a market intervention plan to procure 33,700 tonnes out of the 7 lakh tonnes produced in Telangana with a support price of Rs. 5,000 per quintal and assistance of another Rs. 1,250 per quintal for other expenses.The crash in the prices of grapes not only soured the expectations of the vineyard owners in Maharashtra, but also claimed the lives of at least two farmers.Few takers for grapesThe suicide of 36-year-old Manik Randive and 25-year-old Chetan Vasal, both from Nashik, has been attributed to the poor price their grapes fetched.Despite a robust grape production, there were few takers as the prices had collapsed. According to Shriram Gadhave, president, Vegetable Growers Association of India, wine manufacturers are contending their stocks are full. The average input cost per acre of grape was Rs. 3 lakh. Yet farmers were selling their produce at barely Rs. 2 lakh, he said.According to him, in April last year, more than 95% of the grape harvest was plucked by wholesalers and wine-makers from farmers gardens.Farmers even received a decent rate of Rs. 40-42 per kg. This year, barely 75% of the picking had been completed while the average rate was a paltry Rs. 8 a kg.Dent in tur pricesTur dal, which hit the headlines last year with its skyrocketing prices, has suffered a dent in its demand this year after large scale production. In Maharashtra, production of tur went up from 4.4 lakh tonnes last year to 20.35 lakh tonnes during 2016-17, bringing down the prices by a huge margin.The total purchase by the government through its agencies at a Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs. 5,050 per quintal was only around 4 lakh tonnes while another five lakh tonnes had been sold at rates lesser than the MSP through the Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMC). Several lakh tonnes remain unsold.But, even during the season of scarcity, rarely do farmers benefit. For instance, even though a consumer paid almost Rs. 220 for a kg of tur dal last year, the farm gate price was just Rs. 45 to Rs. 50, said Dr. Deshpande. Does it take Rs. 170 to convert whole tur to edible tur dal, he wondered.Echoing Dr. Deshpandes views on the cobweb phenomenon, Mr. Srinivas, a progressive farmer from T. Narsipura near Mysuru, said he gave up tomato cultivation this year as many farmers began growing the vegetable on a large scale in the region after it realised a good price.( With inputs f romLaiqh A

despair.special arrangementif it is tomatoes in karnataka, it is red chillies in andhra pradesh and telangana, and tur and grapes in maharashtra. an abundance of the produce has led to a crash in prices, dashing the hopes of farmers.while farmers in kolar, karnataka, dumped tomatoes on the road after the prices collapsed to a new low of rs. 2 per kg last week from rs. 10 to rs. 15 a month ago, violent protests broke out in parts of telangana after a good yield of the commodity in the two telugu-speaking states brought down the prices from a high of rs. 10,000 per quintal last year to a measly rs. 2,500 this year.in maharashtra, the demand for tur, which rode a wave of high prices last year, plummeted after its production went up from 4.44 lakh tonnes in 2015-16 to 20.35 lakh tonnes in 2016-17. so was the case of grapes after a crash in their prices plunged the vineyard owners across the state into despair.while most farmers complain about the poor remuneration for their produce in comparison to the prices that prevailed in the previous season, agricultural economists have traced the reasons for the glut and the resultant price crash to the cobweb phenomenon.after the prices of a particular agricultural commodity shoot through the roof during a season of scarcity, farmers resort to boosting the production on the premise of the pre-existing demand and prices, leading to a problem of plenty, reasoned dr. r.s. deshpande, former director of the institute of social and economic change (isec), bengaluru, explaining the cobweb phenomenon.most of the agricultural products that have now suffered a price crash due to their abundance had yielded a rich dividend in the previous season.chilli woesa long duration crop, consuming up to eight months for harvesting, red chilli cultivation was expanded in both telangana and andhra pradesh this year after the commodity commanded a good price last year.however, in the absence of minimum support price for the crop, categorised as commercial, the market dynamics of demand-supply kept the price low from the beginning of arrivals in the market this season from april first week. as the top quality red chilli yielded a price of even rs. 13,000 per quintal last year, the farming community had hopes of good returns this year too, a senior telangana agriculture department official told the hindu . but, it was not to be. the centre has, however, announced a market intervention plan to procure 33,700 tonnes out of the 7 lakh tonnes produced in telangana with a support price of rs. 5,000 per quintal and assistance of another rs. 1,250 per quintal for other expenses.the crash in the prices of grapes not only soured the expectations of the vineyard owners in maharashtra, but also claimed the lives of at least two farmers.few takers for grapesthe suicide of 36-year-old manik randive and 25-year-old chetan vasal, both from nashik, has been attributed to the poor price their grapes fetched.despite a robust grape production, there were few takers as the prices had collapsed. according to shriram gadhave, president, vegetable growers association of india, wine manufacturers are contending their stocks are full.

As food and drink establishments proliferate in certain locations, like Lower Parel and Bandra Kurla Complex, there are vast swathes of the city where residents live, but without the kind of dining or drinking options that locals crave.As Pooja Kanodia, who is the restaurateur with her husband, Pankaj, says with a laugh, My neighbourhood is very large, it stretches from Cuffe Parade all the way to Lower Parel. Canto, is a new all-day dining restaurant and bar at Opera House, occupying the spot that was formerly Karma. The Kanodias all-day restaurant and bar is targeting those people that dont want to drive to another part of the city for a night out, and is counting on the fact that there are enough people that would rather visit some place closer, that serves both quality food and drinks, and who want to visit often.Canto, lives up on both counts, with a menu that has been put-together by consultant chef Gracian DSouza, and a bar that features signature tipples by Mukesh Khatri of Bar Solutions. The interiors, by Shweta Kaushik, are transportive, allowing you to imagine a swish Milanese clubhouse, with velvet sofas, lots of green tones and arched windows that let you look out to the street. Says Kaushik of the interiors, They wanted a very vintage vibe, and no distressed finishings at all. A mirrored bar area, with black stone helps set off all the colour, and makes a mean spezie negroni, their twist on the classic cocktail, which comes with citrus infused gin, sweet masala vermouth and Campari bitters.A consideration made during the design process was the ample number of power outlets for those that want to work out of the restaurant, while sampling the eaterys all-day menu. Says Pooja, Weve tried to maintain a very warm and inviting feel. The worry, with an eatery that wants to be everythinga caf, bar, restaurant and hang outis that it ends up falling short on all counts. At Canto, that doesnt seem to be a problem, though its still early days when it comes to how customers see the all-day space, after all it opened in May 2.The food, is of the moment though, and Pooja describes it as being, global fusion. What that translates into on the menu is dishes like the ragda bao and sambar risotto. During the course of our interview though, we sampled less fusion fare, including a highly recommended lamb meatballs, which thankfully, had more of the promised tomato and less of the coconut flavour in its sauce. Also on the menu are au current favourites like the cheesy eggs Kejriwal.Even though a majority of the restaurants in the area are all vegetarian, serving up comfort food, at Canto the menu includes non-vegetarian fare, as the Kanodias wanted the eatery to be inclusive and welcoming to all.Canto, Opera House, Charni Road; 30151537; 12 noon to 1.30 a.m.","the neighbourhood bar, as a concept is due for a resurgence in mumbai. as food and drink establishments proliferate in certain locations, like lower parel and bandra kurla complex, there are vast swathes of the city where residents live, but without the kind of dining or drinking options that locals crave.as pooja kanodia, who is the restaurateur with her husband, pankaj, says with a laugh, my neighbourhood is very large, it stretches from cuffe parade all the way to lower parel. canto, is a new all-day dining restaurant and bar at opera house, occupying the spot that was formerly karma. the kanodias all-day restaurant and bar is targeting those people that dont want to drive to another part of the city for a night out, and is counting on the fact that there are enough people that would rather visit some place closer, that serves both quality food and drinks, and who want to visit often.canto, lives up on both counts, with a menu that has been put-together by consultant chef gracian dsouza, and a bar that features signature tipples by mukesh khatri of bar solutions. the interiors, by shweta kaushik, are transportive, allowing you to imagine a swish milanese clubhouse, with velvet sofas, lots of green tones and arched windows that let you look out to the street. says kaushik of the interiors, they wanted a very vintage vibe, and no distressed finishings at all. a mirrored bar area, with black stone helps set off all the colour, and makes a mean spezie negroni, their twist on the classic cocktail, which comes with citrus infused gin, sweet masala vermouth and campari bitters.a consideration made during the design process was the ample number of power outlets for those that want to work out of the restaurant, while sampling the eaterys all-day menu. says pooja, weve tried to maintain a very warm and inviting feel. the worry, with an eatery that wants to be everythinga caf, bar, restaurant and hang outis that it ends up falling short on all counts. at canto, that doesnt seem to be a problem, though its still early days when it comes to how customers see the all-day space, after all it opened in may 2.the food, is of the moment though, and pooja describes it as being, global fusion. what that translates into on the menu is dishes like the ragda bao and sambar risotto. during the course of our interview though, we sampled less fusion fare, including a highly recommended lamb meatballs, which thankfully, had more of the promised tomato and less of the coconut flavour in its sauce. also on the menu are au current favourites like the cheesy eggs kejriwal.even though a majority of the restaurants in the area are all vegetarian, serving up comfort food, at canto the menu includes non-vegetarian fare, as the kanodias wanted the eatery to be inclusive and welcoming to all.canto, opera house, charni road; 30151537; 12 noon to 1.30 a.m."
5a00cc4d9855b76bf13a48ee,Address it fast,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/626785/address-fast.html,2017-08-06,,Deccan Herald,"Address it fastSudhirendar Sharma, Aug 8 2017, 9:26 ISTFrom being thrown on the streets in Mandsaur to being protected by the police in Mumbai in the past few weeks, tomato has turned out to be the truly red-faced farm commodity in last few weeks.Tomato has joined onion and pulses as the latest victim of price fluctuations that has left farmers and consumers fuming. While farmers were forced to sell tomato at less than Rs 5 per kg, consumers are compelled to buy it at Rs 100 per kg.Price distortions of farm commodities are a continuing phenomenon, as farmers lack control over pricing their own produce. More shocking is the fact that at the receiving end are 30% of rural households who cultivate 82% of arable land in the country.With most landholdings being less than one hectare, the capacity of small holders to bear loss on their produce is anything but suicidal. One farmer suicide every 40 minutes in the country reflects a systemic failure.The crisis amplifies when a previous year high price for a particular crop entices farmers to expand cultivation of the said crop in the following year. Farmers in Andhra Pradesh were shocked when tomatoes fetched Rs 551 per quintal in June this year compared to Rs 3,015 per quintal during the same month last year.Neither was there a drop in consumption of tomatoes nor was there an unexpected glut in the market. And, yet price plummeted like never before. Despite fertilisers and power subsidies, cost of cultivation has been on the increase each year. With farmers not making profit on their small produce (on an average farmers keep 25% produce for home consumption), about 52% of agricultural households are in debt.Average household debt is Rs 47,000. This is unlikely to change as annual income of median farmers is merely Rs 20,000 or just Rs 1,666 per month as per Economic Survey of 2016. That the middlemen and traders are milking large share of the profit is no breaking news. Shocking is the fact that in addition to farmers and consumers bearing the brunt, the state too is at the receiving end of price distortions.Having purchased 8.76 lakh tonnes of onion at a support price of Rs 8 per kg during last five weeks, the Madhya Pradesh State Cooperative Marketing Federation is now forced to sell the same at Rs 2 per kg via the public distribution system.Price distortions have caught the government by surprise too. To avoid onion stocks from rotting over, the Madhya Pradesh State Civil Supplies Corporation could fetch only Rs 2-3 per kg in the open market.One reason for the glut in onion had to do with the Federation purchasing it at a high price which encouraged the farmers from Maharashtra and Gujarat to unload their produce in Madhya Pradesh. However, the cumulative loss to the exchequer in this transaction alone is worth Rs 900 crore.What is true for tomato and onion is equally true for other commodities including pulses. Having stocked two million tonnes of pulses during last two years, crash in market price of pulses has left the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (Nafed) high and dry.All this lends credence to the argument that farmers get no more than 25% of the price that consumers pay, and the minimum support price in the best of circumstances benefits only 6% farmers.Under such conditions, does the governments stated objective of doubling farmers income by 2022 hold any ground? Far from taking the price distortion issue head on, the Niti Aayog instead contends that without additional income from non-farm sources, farmers will not be able to cross income of Rs 18,000 per month even after the doubling efforts.The condition demands a mix of soft and hard options to pull farmers out from the current distress. The soft options include liberalisation of contract farming, direct purchase by processors and bulk buyers, direct sale by farmers to end users etc.The hard options include shifting of the workforce to non-agricultural occupations, an inclusion of supplementary sources of income, modernisation of farming and marketing practices, reforms in land lease and better price realisation.It is clear that none of the options proposed by the Niti Aayog can rid agriculture from prevailing price distortions. If farmers are not assured of remunerative prices for their produce, their interest in farming will wane further.Allow exportsA recent World Bank supported study on Price Distortions in Indian Agriculture by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) suggests a ban on export bans on agriculture commodities to help farmers.The report draws reference to lost opportunity on account of export restrictions on wheat during 2007-2011 subsequent to the lifting of the trade ban wheat exports had touched a high of $5 billion in 2012.The question that begs an answer is whether or not exports directly benefit farmers? Exports do contribute to overall agriculture economics, but do not constitute direct benefit to farmers who are often at the mercy of the unending chain of middlemen.Since farmers income is unlikely to be doubled under the business-as-usual scenario, farmers would need direct cash incentives, in addition to input subsidies, to stay in the business of farming.Improving input efficiency (fertiliser and water) will help farmers make choice of crops to be grown. Crop advisories based on price trends of last few years, transit storage facilities at cluster level, and promotion of cooperative farming can enhance bargaining power of farmers.(Sharma writes on development issues)","address it fastsudhirendar sharma, aug 8 2017, 9:26 istfrom being thrown on the streets in mandsaur to being protected by the police in mumbai in the past few weeks, tomato has turned out to be the truly red-faced farm commodity in last few weeks.tomato has joined onion and pulses as the latest victim of price fluctuations that has left farmers and consumers fuming. while farmers were forced to sell tomato at less than rs 5 per kg, consumers are compelled to buy it at rs 100 per kg.price distortions of farm commodities are a continuing phenomenon, as farmers lack control over pricing their own produce. more shocking is the fact that at the receiving end are 30% of rural households who cultivate 82% of arable land in the country.with most landholdings being less than one hectare, the capacity of small holders to bear loss on their produce is anything but suicidal. one farmer suicide every 40 minutes in the country reflects a systemic failure.the crisis amplifies when a previous year high price for a particular crop entices farmers to expand cultivation of the said crop in the following year. farmers in andhra pradesh were shocked when tomatoes fetched rs 551 per quintal in june this year compared to rs 3,015 per quintal during the same month last year.neither was there a drop in consumption of tomatoes nor was there an unexpected glut in the market. and, yet price plummeted like never before. despite fertilisers and power subsidies, cost of cultivation has been on the increase each year. with farmers not making profit on their small produce (on an average farmers keep 25% produce for home consumption), about 52% of agricultural households are in debt.average household debt is rs 47,000. this is unlikely to change as annual income of median farmers is merely rs 20,000 or just rs 1,666 per month as per economic survey of 2016. that the middlemen and traders are milking large share of the profit is no breaking news. shocking is the fact that in addition to farmers and consumers bearing the brunt, the state too is at the receiving end of price distortions.having purchased 8.76 lakh tonnes of onion at a support price of rs 8 per kg during last five weeks, the madhya pradesh state cooperative marketing federation is now forced to sell the same at rs 2 per kg via the public distribution system.price distortions have caught the government by surprise too. to avoid onion stocks from rotting over, the madhya pradesh state civil supplies corporation could fetch only rs 2-3 per kg in the open market.one reason for the glut in onion had to do with the federation purchasing it at a high price which encouraged the farmers from maharashtra and gujarat to unload their produce in madhya pradesh. however, the cumulative loss to the exchequer in this transaction alone is worth rs 900 crore.what is true for tomato and onion is equally true for other commodities including pulses. having stocked two million tonnes of pulses during last two years, crash in market price of pulses has left the national agricultural cooperative marketing federation (nafed) high and dry.all this lends credence to the argument that farmers get no more than 25% of the price that consumers pay, and the minimum support price in the best of circumstances benefits only 6% farmers.under such conditions, does the governments stated objective of doubling farmers income by 2022 hold any ground?

Deepak Joshi At the APMC market in Kalyan on Saturday. Deepak JoshiThere has been a split in the ranks of farmers over the decision to withdraw their agitation after a meeting with Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis late on Friday night.A large chunk of farmers criticised the delegation which met the CM and claimed that the strike will continue. The backlash against leaders who were part of the delegation which announced the withdrawal of the strike has been so strong that many of them were forced to make a clarification that the strike has not been called off yet.If farmers think I have made a mistake, then I seek forgiveness from them. If they feel that the strike should continue then I am with them, said Jayaji Suryavanshi, member of the Kisan Kranti Morcha.Suryavanshi seemed to have drawn the maximum ire from farmers who burned his effigies. Visuals of the chief minister speaking into his ears during the marathon four-hour meeting on Friday created a perception that he had struck a deal with the government.This is a decision taken by children of farmers and not by politicians. We have told the state government that if it does not stay true to its promise in the next four months, we will not allow the government to function, Suryavanshi had said soon after the core committee meeting with the CM in which the withdrawal had been announced. However, the backlash the decision received seems to have made many leaders including Suryavanshi rethink their position.Many local farmers were unhappy that the committee decided to take a decision without taking into confidence farmers from across the state.The committee should have heard what the government had to say and then come back and shared the details with farmers. They, however, announced the withdrawal of the strike without any concrete assurances from the state or taking people into confidence. For us they are not a core committee but a chor (thieves) committee and we will continue with the agitation, Bhausaheb Shinde, a farmer from Puntamba in Ahmednagar district, which had become the epicentre of the agitation, said.The Maharashtra Kisan Sabha has also criticised the decision to end the strike.The CM has spun a web around farmers. He has not given any clear assurance. If others want, they can withdraw from the agitation but the Maharashtra Kisan Sabha will continue with its agitation till we receive loan waiver for farmers, said a leader of the Maharashtra Kisan Sabha.Ajit Navale, general secretary of the Kisan Sabha, said, The chief minister did not give a clear answer to any of our demands. The new October 31 deadline that has been declared is a farce the 4-person committee will only announce its findings that day. No concrete decision regarding the waiver of loans or implementation of the Swaminathan report has been taken.Fadnavis has said that the commission shall look into waiving of loans of farmers who have smaller lands. What about Vidarbha or Marathwada, where most farmers have 10 to 15 acres of land, said Navale.The Baliraja Shetkari Sanghatna also criticised the withdrawal and claimed that the government was attempting to create a rift between farmers.I was first invited to a meeting with the CM but was detained by the Pune rural police at Dehu Road police station. I was allowed to go only after the announcement of the strike being called off. This is an attempt to create a rift between farmers, Sanjay Patil Ghanekar, leader of the Baliraja Shetkari Sanghatna, said.Meanwhile, farmers in Nashik held a meeting on Saturday and decided to continue with their agitation including a state-wide bandh on June 5. The farmers meeting also heckled senior BJP leaders including Dindori MP Harishchandra Chavan and BJP MLAs from Nashik Balasaheb Sanap and Devyani Pharande when they tried to attend the meeting, forcing them to leave.In spite of the strike being called off, protests continued in areas like Dindori where women farmers blocked traffic on Kalwan Dindori road. In Saigaon near Yeola in Nashik district, onion and milk were thrown on the road. Similar agitations took place in Jalgaon and Parbhani as well.The decision to call off the strike seems to have had no impact on prices of vegetables which have kept on shooting up in cities like Mumbai. The wholesale price of capsicum jumped from Rs 60 on Friday to Rs 100 on Saturday. Carrot prices increased from Rs 40 to Rs 80, tomato from Rs 30 to Rs 80, brinjal Rs 40 to Rs 80. The price of a bundle of coriander jumped from Rs 100 to Rs 150.Vashi APMC saw nearly 175 vehicles coming into the market. However, the bulk of them were from outside the state.The prices are still high. The decision to take the strike back was taken only late on Friday. The market will remain shut on Sunday. We need to see how farmers react on Monday to the strike call that has been given. Only then will we get a clear picture on when prices can stabilise, Naresh Kor, a trader from Vashi APMC said.Lok Sabha MP Raju Shetti said the people who negotiated with the government were novices and he would hold a meeting of all farmer leaders and groups in Nashik next week to chart out the course of action. The Shiv Sena also criticised the state government and claimed that the state, rather than trying to find a solution, had tried to create a rift between farmers.Rather than trying to sort out the problem, the government seems to have tried to create a rift between farmers.

The vast history of gardens and landscape design in India has been compiled into an enthralling exhibition, Tracing Narratives, to be exhibited in Chennai from today, hosted by the Chennai Architecture Foundation as part of Landscape Week.We were beginning to ask ourselves, what the idea of Indian gardens is. We typically ended up discussing the gardens associated with temples, palaces or Mughal and colonial gardens. But for a vast subcontinent like India, these cannot be the only expressions of gardens over time, explains Aniket Bhagwat, a leading landscape architect based in Ahmedabad.As part of Landscape Environment Advancement Foundation (LEAF), which was founded by his father, late Prof Prabhakar B Bhagwat in 2003, they set up a million garden initiative, asking people to send in names of places they felt constitute a garden. This brought up places that we normally dont consider as gardens. For example, a place in the middle of the desert in Kutch, Kala Dungar, where a priest feeds wolves, an ancient crater that had become a lake around which there are many gardens and temples, Aniket recalls.This expanded their idea of what a garden meant. They then began questioning why landscape architecture, instead of being celebrated, is being disregarded. We concluded that its perhaps a fault in our genesis. The genesis of landscape architecture as a profession is the idea of the garden. Theres a huge embedded relationship gardens have in our culture. Because of our over-intellectualising things and assuming that we know our genesis, we have actually forgotten our basis, and fractured it, he rues.LEAF dissected and researched on gardens in India over two years, the result of which is a monograph called Tracing Narratives and a travelling exhibition of the same name. Dedicated to two landscape architects of India  Prabhakar B Bhagwat, Indias first landscape architect, and Mohammad Shaheer, who was involved in restoration of Humayuns garden, Agra  Tracing Narratives eloquently documents the idea of gardens and landscapes in India. Through over a 100 panels, it redefines the whole idea of what a garden is  a not just typical conventional park with trees and shrubs, but also waters structures that dot rivers and tanks, like Abhaneri stepwell in Rajasthan, gardens attached to temples, cemetery gardens, step wells, folklore, etc.The exhibition takes you through literature, paintings, cinema, documents and photographs, with interesting nuggets of information  for instance, did you know that tomatoes were introduced in India from England by the Agri-Horticultural Society of India, in 1857? From works of literature where gardens formed prevalent backdrops, it goes to 19th Century paintings of colonial gardens, the use of landscapes in old and contemporary cinema. Important botanists, horticulturists, writers, foresters and their contributions have also been acknowledged. The voices of various gardens are given a platform  the ancient Mughal gardens in Himalayan backdrops, projects by landscape architects, like the rehabilitation of an old quarry into a forest teeming with over 40 species of birds and trees, intricately illustrated with photographs and illustrations.Weve done this to educate ourselves first. It became an exhibition as a matter of chance, Aniket says, adding that it seems to be bringing the discussion about landscapes to the fore. Exhibitions can have a strange way of affecting the mind. They dont always affect you immediately. A residual idea stays in your mind and keeps niggling at you for a long time, he remarks.

Already hit by plunging prices for the crops he grows in his five-acre family farm in Maharashtras Pimpalgaon Dukre village of Nasik district, he is now staring at abject penury.The state government is set to acquire 50,000 acres of land for the Rs 46,000-crore Mumbai-Nagpur super communication highway to bring development to the backward regions of Vidarbha and Marathwada, but Waghchowre fears it will spell doom for him and his family.The proposed eight-lane highway would eat up four acres of his land holding. We survive and get by because of our land. You take this away from us and we are left with nothing. Not even hope, rues Waghchowre.Watch | Why are Indias farmers seething with anger?Sharing his apprehension are 3,700 farmers in Nasik alone who have registered their objections after receiving the government notification for acquisition of their land. Incidentally, 84% of the land earmarked for the highway project is agricultural.Already caught in the spiral of high input costs and diminishing returns, the highway project is another reason for disquiet among local farmers. The recent farmers protests in north Maharashtra were triggered by the governments land acquisition policies among others.Not just this expressway, but all big-ticket projects cheat farmers, said Ulka Mahajan, an anti-land acquisition activist who had led the protests against the Mahamumbai Special Economic Zone in Raigad. Many farmers agree that road projects such as the Mumbai-Nasik highway will essentially leave them by the wayside.Their list of grievances against the government is long. Top among them is the administrations alleged lack of transparency in land acquisition. Farmers say no social impact assessment was done and the issue of compensation to landless labourers was ignored.They are also not impressed with the price  four times the current market rate  that the government is offering selectively. Our land is irrigated and we can grow crops the whole year round. I dont think you can put a price on that in Maharashtra, said Dhanaji Waghchowre, Shantarams brother.Farming has mostly ceased to be profitable, pushing more and more farmers into a deadly debt trap. According to estimates, 1,129 farmers committed suicide between January and May this year. Majority of these suicides are from Vidarbha and Marathwada, where farmers practice dryland farming. And many of those who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods dont want to give up their lands because theres no viable alternative. The three Waghchowre brothers are among them.As far as Shantaram remembers, the last time he made a killing was in September 2013. Then, he had got Rs 5,000 for a quintal of onions. Belonging to the vegetable belt of Nasik, Shantaram made a cool Rs 2.5 lakh by selling his 50 quintals onions to the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC).Prices have gone downhill since, and so has his financial well-being. 2013 was the best thing to have happenedThis year the price is down to Rs 350 a quintal. I wont even recover my input costs, he said.Farmers spill milk on the road during a demonstration protest over various demands in Nasik. (PTI FILE PHOTO)With onions bringing him tears, he has scaled down his ambitions. A farmer lives on hope. I wont plant onions across my five acres but half an acre is my gamble. Something might pay off, he said. Nearly 40 quintals of unsold onions lie covered under a tarpaulin outside his mud and thatched house adjacent to his field.Onions, however, are just one of Shantarams many problems. Novembers demonetisation hit the family hard and curtailed their access to cash. Then ready-to-harvest tomatoes were lost in a hailstorm in May, resulting in a loss of Rs 40,000. The family thereafter also lost one of its bullocks and the tilling of land in the new sowing season suffered a setback.The Waghchowres are the typical small Maharashtra farmer with three brothers and their families living off the five-acre field. But what separates them from the rest is their irrigated land, courtesy a well and a pipeline that brings water from the Kadwa river nearby. Not every Maharashtria farmer is as lucky, with only 18% of land tilled in the state being irrigated.Report card This is what a Maharashtra farmer got from his farm this year,SS a reason for his anguish Soil quality No soil health card yet from the government Water source: Irrigated by a well and a direct pipeline from the river nearbyNote: This year has been good but in the past, they have faced problems in getting payments on time This is what a Maharashtra farmer got from his farm this year,SS a reason for his anguishIrrigated by a well and a direct pipeline from the river nearbyThis year has been good but in the past, they have faced problems in getting payments on timeShantaram and his two brothers feel that though life isnt exactly good, it could have been much worse without the land. Besides onions, they grow tomatoes, brinjals and sugarcane. Their field is normally lush green even at the height of summer. But that does not necessarily translate into a windfall as there are too many imponderables plaguing the farm sector, including unseasonal rains, pest attacks and price fluctuations.Shrinking profits and heightened unpredictability have put the family in a quandary. The money the brothers make is just enough to feed the family of 10, but inadequate to service their debts.

(PTI Photo, File) Nagpur: Farmers throwing vegetables on a road during a protest as part of the Maharashtra bandh over various demands in Nagpur, Maharashtra on Monday. (PTI Photo, File)A HUNDRED years after Mahatma Gandhi led a movement of indigo growers against their oppressor landlords in Bihars Champaran district, farmers of Maharashtra launched an unprecedented strike early this month. But unlike the Champaran Satyagraha, this was a movement led by farmers themselves. It started with farmers from Puntamba, a sleepy village in Ahmednagar district, deciding at a Gram Sabha meeting in April to stop supply of all produce to cities from June 1. That resolution was subsequently adopted by farmers in villages across Maharashtra, culminating in a stunningly successful strike lasting almost 11 days.The striking farmers not only shut down wholesale produce markets and blocked highways to prevent delivery trucks from reaching urban centres, but also even dumped milk and vegetables on the streets. The Maharashtra government was, then, forced to constitute a Cabinet subcommittee of five ministers to hold consultations on the main demands that included a complete waiver of institutional farm loans and remunerative crop prices based on theM S Swaminathan reports formula of 50 per cent returns over cost. These demands were accepted in principle, following which the strike was called off. The collective might of farmers had clearly triumphed over the all-powerful state.The Maharashtra farmers agitation was remarkable for not only its seeming spontaneity and absence of any towering leader, but also it happening in an above-normal rainfall and bumper agricultural harvest year. Such protests one would have normally expected in the event of losses from drought, especially of the kind seen in 2014-15 and 2015-16.But as the accompanying table shows, the Maharashtra government infused around Rs 20,939 crore during the two consecutive drought years through time-honoured relief measures such as crop loss compensation, insurance claims and labour payments under MGNREGA. In addition, rescheduling of crop loans and reduced interest on these  plus the state governments ambitious Jalyukta Shivar programme of water and soil conservation in 25,000 drought-prone villages  turned out to be significant interventions.The trigger for the current farmers agitation has not been any natural calamity-driven distress, which was, on the whole, deftly handled by the state government. Instead, it has primarily been prices.A bumper crop resulting from good rains had ignited hopes among farmers of setting-off their losses from previous years. But what they encountered was a price crash across crops  from cereals and pulses to vegetables and fruits.Take pulses, where the Centre, in a bid to promote their cultivation to bridge domestic shortages, raised the minimum support price for tur (pigeon-pea) from Rs 4,625 to Rs 5,050 per quintal. Farmers obliged by increasing production, but the government failed to honour its promise. Far from getting the promised rate, farmers had to dump tur for as low as Rs 3,000 per quintal. Even during peak summer, they realised hardly Rs 5 per kg for tomatoes, onions and other vegetables.In short, farmers suffered more with record production on the back of good rains than when there was crop failure from drought.A second trigger for the stir was the crop loan waiver announcement by a newly-elected government in Uttar Pradesh, which took place around the same time prices were crashing. Farmer organisations admit that waiving loans cannot be a real solution, but say that it will have a soothing effect in the present context. At the least, it will bring many farmers back into the formal credit system. Also, if there can be a farm loan waiver in UP, then why not in Maharashtra?What is clear from the above is that the risk of price fluctuation in agricultural commodities isnt covered by any of the existing government relief mechanisms. The need of the hour is a framework that insulates farmers from the shocks of not just natural calamities, but also market price crashes. And loan waiver cannot provide any sustainable solution.That said, the Maharashtra farmers agitation  and the state government having to eventually concede to an unconditional loan waiver  is a game-changer, simply for showing how even an otherwise unorganised class can successfully express and negotiate demands. Organised labour unions, not to speak of industry associations like FICCI and CII, are known for constantly engaging in promoting and protecting the interests of their members. Farmers have had no such arrangements for collective lobbying. In this case, though, ordinary farmers under the most lugubrious conditions stood firm on their demands, resisting attempts to divide and weaken their ranks.The following elements may have contributed to the invisible glue of emotional unity among Maharashtras farmers: * Insensitive statements against farmers by some responsible public figures even amidst tumbling crop prices. Similar statements from top bankers (and also the financial regulator) against loan waivers and the possible adverse impact on repayment culture would only have further fuelled resentment among farmers.* The photos/videos of farmers ploughing back their onion and tomato crops because of not being able to afford the additional cost of harvesting. These images went viral on social media and were exchanged by farmers with one another. n Drying up of credit post-demonetisation from cooperatives, the lifeline of farmers in Maharashtra. They were, then, compelled to approach commercial banks and moneylenders for credit on far less favourable terms.* A spike in suicides, including in northern Maharashtra, the countrys top onion and grape producer. The latter belt has been the epicentre of the strike. The losses to its farmers have been more, as they grow a host of cash crops entailing higher investment and also exhibiting greater sensitivity to price crashes. These farmers are generally more well-off, educated and combative. They, not surprisingly, provided the leadership for the movement.* A sustained public debate on farm debt waiver in the last two years, amidst talk of loan write-offs for big corporates. The Oppositions Sangharsh Yatra and also a ruling coalition partners Atmakalesh Yatra marches in support of loan waiver would only have created the perfect pitch for the farmers strike.These elements established a common chord of angst amongst lakhs of farmers, culminating in a state-wide agitation. This is a classic example of collective behaviour driven by group dynamics that leads people to engage in unthinkable acts under unusual circumstances, as was propounded by the American social scientist Robert E Park. And nobody could have imagined that the success of Maharashtras farmer strike would pave the way for similar demands elsewhere, including in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App","nagpur: farmers throwing vegetables on a road during a protest as part of the maharashtra bandh over various demands in nagpur, maharashtra on monday.

into the formal credit system. also, if there can be a farm loan waiver in up, then why not in maharashtra?what is clear from the above is that the risk of price fluctuation in agricultural commodities isnt covered by any of the existing government relief mechanisms. the need of the hour is a framework that insulates farmers from the shocks of not just natural calamities, but also market price crashes. and loan waiver cannot provide any sustainable solution.that said, the maharashtra farmers agitation  and the state government having to eventually concede to an unconditional loan waiver  is a game-changer, simply for showing how even an otherwise unorganised class can successfully express and negotiate demands. organised labour unions, not to speak of industry associations like ficci and cii, are known for constantly engaging in promoting and protecting the interests of their members. farmers have had no such arrangements for collective lobbying. in this case, though, ordinary farmers under the most lugubrious conditions stood firm on their demands, resisting attempts to divide and weaken their ranks.the following elements may have contributed to the invisible glue of emotional unity among maharashtras farmers: * insensitive statements against farmers by some responsible public figures even amidst tumbling crop prices. similar statements from top bankers (and also the financial regulator) against loan waivers and the possible adverse impact on repayment culture would only have further fuelled resentment among farmers.* the photos/videos of farmers ploughing back their onion and tomato crops because of not being able to afford the additional cost of harvesting. these images went viral on social media and were exchanged by farmers with one another. n drying up of credit post-demonetisation from cooperatives, the lifeline of farmers in maharashtra. they were, then, compelled to approach commercial banks and moneylenders for credit on far less favourable terms.* a spike in suicides, including in northern maharashtra, the countrys top onion and grape producer. the latter belt has been the epicentre of the strike. the losses to its farmers have been more, as they grow a host of cash crops entailing higher investment and also exhibiting greater sensitivity to price crashes. these farmers are generally more well-off, educated and combative. they, not surprisingly, provided the leadership for the movement.* a sustained public debate on farm debt waiver in the last two years, amidst talk of loan write-offs for big corporates. the oppositions sangharsh yatra and also a ruling coalition partners atmakalesh yatra marches in support of loan waiver would only have created the perfect pitch for the farmers strike.these elements established a common chord of angst amongst lakhs of farmers, culminating in a state-wide agitation. this is a classic example of collective behaviour driven by group dynamics that leads people to engage in unthinkable acts under unusual circumstances, as was propounded by the american social scientist robert e park. and nobody could have imagined that the success of maharashtras farmer strike would pave the way for similar demands elsewhere, including in madhya pradesh and rajasthan.for all the latest india news, download indian express app"

The current prices of tomatoes have already soared to Rs 70-80 per kg in retail markets and would remain so for at least next two months.According to wholesalers, the prices have increased due to a heavy reduction in supply of tomatoes from neighbouring states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Haryana after the rain.Tomato prices shooting up is a normal occurrence during the monsoon months, from June to September. This is because the stock spoils easily during the rain. Right now, we are getting our supply only from Himachal Pradesh, said Rajendra Sharma, president of Azadpur Mandi.The shelf life of tomatoes is not more than four days. Not all retailers have an access to cold storage. So, they tend to recover the losses by selling at a higher price, Sharma said.According to wholesalers, the situation will remain the same until fresh stocks arrive in the markets by August-end.On Thursday, the wholesale prices of tomatoes at the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) market at Gazipur were between Rs 30 and 40.The soaring prices of vegetables have affected the sales of vendors in local markets.Till May-June, the retail price of tomatoes was Rs 40 per kg. As soon as the pre-monsoon showers hit the city, the prices climbed to Rs 60 per kg and finally soared to Rs 80 per kg by the end of the month. Due to a spike in prices, people do not buy more than half a kilogram of tomato at a time, said Abdullah, a vendor at Malviya Nagar vegetable market.Even coriander leaves and green chilies, which came complimentary with vegetables, are now being sold with a price tag of over Rs 10-15 for 100 grams. The increase in the vegetable prices has forced many to exclude these from their shopping list.Except for onions and potatoes, prices of all vegetables have increased by Rs 5-10 in the market. I used to buy vegetables for Rs 200 twice a week, but now the same quantity of vegetables cost anything between Rs 300 and Rs 350, said Aarti Malik, a resident of Geetanjali.","htreporters@hindustantimes.comthe price of tomatoes, which remains a staple in almost every indian kitchen, is likely to get dearer in the coming days. the current prices of tomatoes have already soared to rs 70-80 per kg in retail markets and would remain so for at least next two months.according to wholesalers, the prices have increased due to a heavy reduction in supply of tomatoes from neighbouring states like uttar pradesh, maharashtra and haryana after the rain.tomato prices shooting up is a normal occurrence during the monsoon months, from june to september. this is because the stock spoils easily during the rain. right now, we are getting our supply only from himachal pradesh, said rajendra sharma, president of azadpur mandi.the shelf life of tomatoes is not more than four days. not all retailers have an access to cold storage. so, they tend to recover the losses by selling at a higher price, sharma said.according to wholesalers, the situation will remain the same until fresh stocks arrive in the markets by august-end.on thursday, the wholesale prices of tomatoes at the agriculture produce marketing committee (apmc) market at gazipur were between rs 30 and 40.the soaring prices of vegetables have affected the sales of vendors in local markets.till may-june, the retail price of tomatoes was rs 40 per kg. as soon as the pre-monsoon showers hit the city, the prices climbed to rs 60 per kg and finally soared to rs 80 per kg by the end of the month. due to a spike in prices, people do not buy more than half a kilogram of tomato at a time, said abdullah, a vendor at malviya nagar vegetable market.even coriander leaves and green chilies, which came complimentary with vegetables, are now being sold with a price tag of over rs 10-15 for 100 grams. the increase in the vegetable prices has forced many to exclude these from their shopping list.except for onions and potatoes, prices of all vegetables have increased by rs 5-10 in the market. i used to buy vegetables for rs 200 twice a week, but now the same quantity of vegetables cost anything between rs 300 and rs 350, said aarti malik, a resident of geetanjali."

""I had planned an elaborate menu with salad since I had guests coming over the next day. But I was shocked to find peas selling at Rs 250 a kilo and turai at Rs 100! I could have easily bought 100 gm of cashew in that money,"" she exclaims.With the farmers of the state protesting the non-waiver of their loans (especially after crop failure), the agitation has led to a massive rise in the prices of vegetables and milk. Though the situation is improving, raising hopes of the rates returning to normal, the last few days have been nothing short of a nightmare for Mumbaikars. Radha Joshi, a chemistry lecturer, says, ""Not only have the prices skyrocketed, the vegetables also don't seem fresh. I understand the plight of the farmers, but this has definitely affected vendors and consumers. The government has to act fast.""The city is feeling the pinch in their pockets with the rates of regular vegetables like brinjal and cabbage doubling up. Matunga resident Astha Shrivatsav, a marketing manager, says, ""I paid Rs 70 for a kilo of cabbage, and Rs 64 for ivy gourd yesterday. I spent Rs 400 overall on veggies that would last me just three days."" Thane-based Minnat Mehrotra, an economist, explains, ""The rates of vegetables have been fluctuating in recent months. A few weeks ago, onions were selling at Rs 100 per kilo because of drought conditions in Andhra Pradesh. And now, the prices of all vegetables have gone up by at least 40 per cent because of the farmers' strike. There was no constant supply from the wholesale market and vendors had to rely on middlemen. I returned empty-handed from market over the weekend as I felt like I was buying gold, not vegetables.""Ever since the prices have risen, Dhivya Kumar, a second-year commerce student, is in an unusual dilemma. She says, ""I'm on a salad diet, but in the last three days, I haven't been able to afford lettuce or broccoli. The cabbages and carrots that I found in the Bandra market were almost rotten."" The month of Ramzan is on and Kurla-based homemaker Masooma Noorani rues, ""We alternate between veg and non-veg dishes to break the fast. We make bhajiyas out of brinjal, capsicum, potatoes, green chilies and even karela. But since vegetables are costing a bomb, we've been having chicken kebabs and other non-veg dishes regularly over the past few days.""Ever since e-commerce took the country by storm, people have been turning to shopping portals to order anything and everything  from clothes and electronics to cosmetics and vegetables. But if you are thinking you'd get veggies at nominal prices online now, here's some news  many online grocery stores have run out of vegetables. In fact, some portals have shut down the 'vegetable' category in their drop-down menu altogether! Vyasakh Mukundan, a civil engineer, rues, ""I checked several online stores for veggies like French beans, but they were out of stock. Tomatoes and bhindi were selling at Rs 20 less than what is available in the market. But when I ordered online, I got a message from the store a few hours later, saying they wouldn't be able to deliver it to me that day.""Among those who dig the well before they are thirsty is Deepali Chabra, an investment banker. She bought enough vegetables to last a week. ""I was worried that the supply to the markets would stop if the agitation intensifies. So, I bought a lot of vegetables and picked up several cartons of milk, too. However, I don't have enough storage space in my fridge,"" she says.Radha Venkatesh, a homemaker, did the same. But she follows certain steps to prolong the shelf life of the veggies. She says, ""I rely on my grandmother's trick to keep veggies fresher for longer. For instance, I store tomatoes in a bowl lined with newspaper. Ditto with palak and other green leafy vegetables. Wrap the leaves in paper, but consume them before four days. I blanch vegetables like brinjal, capsicum and cucumber in hot water and freeze them. Always remember to store onions in the dark corner of your kitchen.

He adds, ""I think I'll save more money that way!""The hospitality sector is one industry that comes directly under fire with the soaring of vegetables prices. Though restaurants haven't cut corners till now, owners aren't sure for how long they'll be able to manage if the prices don't return to normal.

Iceberg lettuce is Rs 300 a kilo. Broccolis' regular rates of Rs 160 a kilo has shot up to Rs 300. Kothmir was Rs 20-30 a bundle, but now, it is Rs 100.""Not to forget, a bundle of mint leaves (pudina) now costs a whopping Rs 50. He adds, ""The rate of palak has tripled; it's now selling at Rs 30. Tomatoes are Rs 48 a kilo in wholesale market, but we sell it at Rs 60. That's because there's a wastage of at least 30 per cent when we transport them to our shop. We have no choice but to increase our price accordingly, as we need to earn, too."" Sadly, those who sell vegetables on carts have shut shop altogether. Vilas Shetye says he hasn't set shop at Cuffe Parade in the last two days. ""I couldn't afford to buy from the wholesale market. Others who sell veggies on carts inside complexes only have produce that is more than two days old. But we are hopeful that the situation will improve in the next two days,"" he says optimistically.","raphic designer nandita shenoy was in for a rude shock when she went to buy vegetables from the dadar market last friday.

In several parts of the state, protesting farmers destroyed stocks of vegetables and milk headed towards cities and clashed with police as the chief minister ruled out a blanket loan waiver.Wholesale prices of certain produce increased by Rs 5-10 on Thursday as only 430 trucks arrived in the Navi Mumbai APMC, compared to the usual 500.""Retail prices did not increase on the first day of the strike.

""While 30-40% vegetable supplies for Mumbai come from other states, prices of items coming from outside Maharashtra remained constant. Supplies of capsicum and tomato were less than the daily requirement which pushed their prices up. Friday will be decisive,"" said Balasaheb Badade, a trader.On Thursday, hundreds of agitating farmers in western and north Maharashtra and Marathwada region poured milk and dumped vegetables on roads to denounce government's inaction. Meanwhile, the agitation's co-ordinating body said the strike will intensify after chief minister Devendra Fadnavis rejected two of their main demands in a press conference in Mumbai. The CM ruled out a blanket loan waiver and said the state government will have to study whether implementation of the Swaminathan committee report will benefit the state. The Swaminathan committee report suggested support pricing for all agricultural produce in the state. ""A complete loan waiver is not possible for the state. If we had to give a loan waiver to all farmers in the state we would require Rs 1 lakh crore which is not even the revenue of the state per year,"" said Fadnavis. The state's annual revenue is between Rs 85,000-90,000 crore.""There are 31 lakh farmers across the state, who are outside the banking credit system and we are working on a scheme to make them creditworthy again. That itself works out to Rs 30,500 crore. We will have to look into their pending loans for which a committee has been formed,"" said Fadnavis.He slammed farmers who stopped trucks on Thursday and threw the produce on the roads. ""How can these people, who are holding other farmers to ransom, call themselves farmers? A strike has to be voluntary. You can't force anyone to be a part of your group,"" said Fadnavis. The CM said the government has called people leading the protest for talks. He also warned milk co-operatives who are not accepting milk from farmers. ""We will dissolve their board and appoint a government administrator, if these instances continue,"" he said.Finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said in Pune, ""The scenes of farmers resorting to strike are as heartbreaking as mothers shunning their duties towards children. It is definitely not a matter of pride for us that farmers are taking to the streets.""Several instances of stone pelting, burning and damaging of vehicles were reported across the state and police fired in the air to disperse agitators.

They have also cited less buying by retailers during rainy season as another reason for supply shortage in local markets.In retail markets , increase in average prices is ranging between Rs 10 and Rs 15 per kg. So far, the worst hit has been tomato which has seen a decline in supply and a sharp rise in prices. During the past fortnight, tomato price has increased by around Rs 15 per kg.

The dominant arm of the elite was, of course, the Congress, which was in power from 1947 until 2014 except only for 13 years (1977-1980, 1989-91 and 1996-2004).The present news trend, and expert opinions, are very confusing. You have a marked improvement in agricultural growth, and you have farmer riots in two large states  Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. You have an economy that has been slowing since June 2016, and inflation now at historical lows, and you have economic experts stating that the RBI/MPC decisions have been valid because the wise MPC is looking beyond the temporary decline in inflation to 2 per cent brought about by demonetisation.One of the major objectives of demonetisation was to diminish the role of cash (read black money) transactions. However, if the expert headlines are to be believed, the volume of digital transactions is contracting. What we are witnessing in India is a historic transformation  one that occurs rarely in most countries. It has never occurred in India before, never. But it is happening now. It is a changing of the guard  more appropriately, a changing of the elites.The single most critical factor in Indian politics, from its independence in 1947 until the birth of the Modi administration in 2014, was that the same elite ruled the country. Regardless of political affiliation, this elite had broadly the same political and economic philosophy, characterised by Western-style social liberalism and Fabian economic socialism. In addition, traditionally, the elite was heavily anti-American.The dominant arm of the elite was,The dominant arm of the elite was, of course, the Congress, which was in power from 1947 until 2014 except only for 13 years (1977-1980, 1989-91 and 1996-2004). And except for five years (1991-1996), a Gandhi family leader was the PM or in charge (as was the case during the 2004-2014 period when Manmohan Singh was the PM, but Sonia Gandhi was in control).The influential English-language press shares the basic Congress worldview. Thus, they could not possibly believe that Modi, an unabashed Hindu leader, would win in 2014. There was a parallel belief that the BJP could not possibly win in the largest state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) in 2017. Of course, the rise of a new cosmology represented by Modi wasnt an overnight phenomenon, as things were gradually changing. Starting with Narasimha Rao, India began to distance itself from heavy state involvement in economic activities. Economic reforms (especially for industry) were introduced in 1991, tax reforms in 1997, and the beginning of disinvestment in 1998. With the signing of the nuclear deal with US President George Bush in 2008, the first major step towards the American camp was taken by India.As time went on, however, it became increasingly clear that the old elite had failed to notice and respect that India had changed from the illiterate and feudal order prevalent at the time the Nehru dynasty assumed control. There are complex factors feeding into each other to explain the publics increasing mistrust in the old elite, but it can safely be pointed out that the educational level of average Indians has risen; the old elite mismanaged the economy  and power corrupted the old elite.The Indian people are asking more questions and demanding greater accountability from dynastic political leaders. But the old elite  politicians, corporates, left-intellectuals, academics  cannot be expected to give up their privileges so easily. They will try to derail the transformation and object at every turn: If that means fake analysis, they will do so. If that means intellectual gymnastics, they will do so. The key point is that they must do so.This is a long drawn-out battle, and a healthy battle. This is what checks and balances are all about. Should the new elite emerge without being questioned? No. Can the new elite just be allowed to roll over the old elite? Definitely not. Will the old elite use all its instruments, and cash in all the old I-owe-you(s) in order to influence the debate, even with fake news and even flakier analysis, if need be? You bet. This is one movie India has never seen before. Sit back, learn, comprehend and enjoy.The battle is joined from all sides. Even from within the BJP. The new elite wants to rewrite history. That is its privilege. But do they have to distort history as much as they claim the Congress did? And do they have to ban documentaries, just like Indira Gandhi did with the banning of Louis Malles nine-hour documentary Phantom India? Or, the later banning of The Satanic Verses?It is important that history be re-written  all new-born elites have done that since time immemorial. But why write history in as distorted a manner as the previous 70 years  by obliterating any mention of Nehru? And will you next sink as low as previous historians who find that the actions of General Rawat (defending parading an innocent as a human shield) and General Dyer (who oversaw the Jallianwala Bagh massacre) are comparable? Invoke Savarkar if you will, but also mention that he was not opposed to cow slaughter. And remember your Hindu Vedic ancestors, who not only did not infringe on the diets of others, but also ate beef.In my previous article (Just why are farmers rioting, IE, June 10), I documented that because of good weather, agricultural growth in 2016-17 was much better than the previous two years (4.9 per cent in 2016-17 vs an average of 0.5 per cent in 2014-15 and 2015-16). Farmer incomes had improved  so, riots now and not before? Some experts pointed out that flower sellers had suffered because of demonetisation  true; some others pointed out that vegetable sellers had suffered, especially those cultivating potatoes, onions and tomatoes. And many, indirectly or directly, attributed all of the price decline to the disruptive policy of demonetisation.The same experts are silent on what happened to fruit prices, also a perishable crop and subject to bad demonetisation  fruit prices (wholesale and consumer) are up 5 per cent y-o-y. And they are silent on sugar, rice and wheat farmers  their prices are up 10-15 per cent. How many vegetable farmers in India? Less than 4 million. How many rice, sugar and wheat farmers  close to 90 million.Now, demonetisation. This is aNow, demonetisation. This is a parallel to the farmers-are-justified-in-rioting-with-record-crop-output flake news. And that is that demonetisation was a comprehensive failure because its simplest goal  reduce cash transactions  has not been achieved. The evidence offered by several experts  RBI data on cash and non-cash transactions since November 2016.There is a basic flaw in this lazy approach to ideological analysis. The experts only process data from November onwards, and are not willing (because of the results?) to look at the change in non-cash transactions over the last three years. They compare April to March 2017, find the volume of transactions lower, and conclude that demonetisation was a failure. The old elite could not possibly do a worse job!The accompanying table documents RBI data on all non-cash transactions (by volume) since 2014. For each year, the data reported is an average for the months January-April. Card usage is only for POS transactions (as emphasised by the RBI in its weekly releases). You be the judge. Total non-cash transactions increased by 53 per cent over last year, January-April. And non-cash transactions induced by demonetisation  debit and credit cards (POS), prepaid and mobile  are up 173 per cent. Your sixth-grade daughter will tell you this is doubling every eight months.

PTI Photo Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan consoles family members of a deceased farmer, killed in the recent police firing, at village Lodh in Mandsaur district. PTI PhotoThe farmers protests in Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Maharashtra indicate that all is not well on the economic front, especially agriculture. If such unrest could happen in MP, which claims to have registered the fastest agri-GDP growth at 9.7 per cent per year during 2005-06 to 2014-15, then no state is likely to be immune from it.MP has been a showcase for the performance of BJP-ruled states in agriculture. But it now appears that agriculture could be Prime Minister Narendra Modis Achilles heel. The governments poor performance in the sector at the all-India level  testified to by a growth rate of less than 2 per cent per annum during 2014/15 to 2016/17  has to be addressed quickly, and in a sustained manner. Otherwise, the neglect of agriculture may cost the PM heavily in 2019.What has really gone wrong with agriculture during the Modi era? And how can it be fixed? We focus here on prices and farm loans, although agriculture suffers from a number of problems.The current protest in MP seems to have been triggered by the crash in onion prices, but it also drew strength from the news of loan waivers in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Maharashtra. The seeds of competitive loan waivers were sown by the PM himself  at a rally during the election to the UP assembly, he announced that farmer loans will be waived in the very first meeting of the new UP cabinet, if the BJP were to be voted to power in the state. The new UP Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath, followed the PMs advice diligently.Farmers in other states have been watching, and the loan waiver could lead to a demand for similar waivers in other states  Haryana, Punjab, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. We wont be surprised if loan waivers cost state treasuries Rs 2,00,000 crore in the months to come, taking state-level deficits closer to 4 per cent of their GDP.What is it that the farmers are demanding? Simply remunerative prices for their farm produce. The BJP had promised in its 2014 election manifesto that if voted to office, the party will ensure 50 per cent margin to farmers over their costs. Where does the Modi government stand on that promise after three years in office, compared to the last three years of the Manmohan Singh government?Graphics by Sarfaraz Graphics by SarfarazWe dug out official data of net margins (the MSP minus cost C2) from the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices reports of the last six years (see Graph 1). The bitter truth is that net margins in most agricultural commodities  paddy, maize, cotton, gram, sugarcane  have actually declined during the Modi regime. Moreover, if one looks at just 2016-17 data, there were negative margins on several commodities: Jowar (-18 per cent), ragi (-20 per cent), sesamum (-14 per cent), sunflower (-13 per cent), groundnut (-4 per cent), moong (-7 per cent) and urad (-4 per cent). With a glut in tur production, market prices fell way below the MSP and the real losses were even higher. Potatoes, onions and tomatoes seem to have met the same fate.No wonder there is widespread unrest amongst farmers. They suffered back-to-back droughts in the first two years of the Modi government, and now, in the third year, despite good rains and bumper harvests, they are suffering due to the collapse in prices. Loan waivers are not a solution: They are band-aids and give temporary breathing space to policymakers.The best way to handle prices is to get the markets right. Remember, prices are determined by the forces of demand and supply, and cost enters through the supply curve. Factoring in only the costs plus pricing without considering the demand side can lead to even greater distortions, and therefore needs to be avoided.But how does one get markets right? Take the case of tur; India had a bumper harvest of tur in the last season. But the government banned its exports, private entities were not allowed to hold stocks and trading in futures had also been banned. No wonder, with bumper harvest on the one hand, and strangulated markets on the other, prices crashed, tumbling way below the MSP, creating misery for farmers and causing unrest.The solution is simple: Abolish all export bans, private stocking limits and restrictions on futures trading in all agri-commodities. This is all the more desirable in commodities whose imports are open at low or zero duties. If this is not done, the government will be forced to buy all commodities whose prices nosedive. This is neither an efficient, nor a feasible policy option.For perishables like onions, potatoes and tomatoes, we need more and better storage facilities, linkages with processing firms, contract farming, opening land lease markets, etc. We need to develop efficient, equitable value chains  like the AMUL model in dairy.But there is one problem on the agri-credit front that needs to be addressed urgently. Farmers need cash immediately after harvests to pay their debts from formal and informal sources. Warehouse receipt systems and giving the farmers advances against their stocks is the way to go.The biggest failure of the RBI and NABARD has been on the financial inclusion front: Even in 2013  the latest information we have  of the total outstanding debt of rural households, 44 per cent came from informal sources (Graph 2). Interest rates in the informal sector hover anywhere from 15-30 per cent.Thus, instead of interest subvention schemes, the government needs to focus on financial inclusion if it wants to address farmers problems on a sustainable basis.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App","madhya pradesh chief minister shivraj singh chouhan consoles family members of a deceased farmer, killed in the recent police firing, at village lodh in mandsaur district. pti photo madhya pradesh chief minister shivraj singh chouhan consoles family members of a deceased farmer, killed in the recent police firing, at village lodh in mandsaur district. pti photothe farmers protests in madhya pradesh (mp) and maharashtra indicate that all is not well on the economic front, especially agriculture. if such unrest could happen in mp, which claims to have registered the fastest agri-gdp growth at 9.7 per cent per year during 2005-06 to 2014-15, then no state is likely to be immune from it.mp has been a showcase for the performance of bjp-ruled states in agriculture. but it now appears that agriculture could be prime minister narendra modis achilles heel. the governments poor performance in the sector at the all-india level  testified to by a growth rate of less than 2 per cent per annum during 2014/15 to 2016/17  has to be addressed quickly, and in a sustained manner. otherwise, the neglect of agriculture may cost the pm heavily in 2019.what has really gone wrong with agriculture during the modi era?

simply remunerative prices for their farm produce. the bjp had promised in its 2014 election manifesto that if voted to office, the party will ensure 50 per cent margin to farmers over their costs. where does the modi government stand on that promise after three years in office, compared to the last three years of the manmohan singh government?graphics by sarfaraz graphics by sarfarazwe dug out official data of net margins (the msp minus cost c2) from the commission for agricultural costs and prices reports of the last six years (see graph 1). the bitter truth is that net margins in most agricultural commodities  paddy, maize, cotton, gram, sugarcane  have actually declined during the modi regime. moreover, if one looks at just 2016-17 data, there were negative margins on several commodities: jowar (-18 per cent), ragi (-20 per cent), sesamum (-14 per cent), sunflower (-13 per cent), groundnut (-4 per cent), moong (-7 per cent) and urad (-4 per cent). with a glut in tur production, market prices fell way below the msp and the real losses were even higher. potatoes, onions and tomatoes seem to have met the same fate.no wonder there is widespread unrest amongst farmers. they suffered back-to-back droughts in the first two years of the modi government, and now, in the third year, despite good rains and bumper harvests, they are suffering due to the collapse in prices. loan waivers are not a solution: they are band-aids and give temporary breathing space to policymakers.the best way to handle prices is to get the markets right. remember, prices are determined by the forces of demand and supply, and cost enters through the supply curve. factoring in only the costs plus pricing without considering the demand side can lead to even greater distortions, and therefore needs to be avoided.but how does one get markets right? take the case of tur; india had a bumper harvest of tur in the last season. but the government banned its exports, private entities were not allowed to hold stocks and trading in futures had also been banned. no wonder, with bumper harvest on the one hand, and strangulated markets on the other, prices crashed, tumbling way below the msp, creating misery for farmers and causing unrest.the solution is simple: abolish all export bans, private stocking limits and restrictions on futures trading in all agri-commodities. this is all the more desirable in commodities whose imports are open at low or zero duties. if this is not done, the government will be forced to buy all commodities whose prices nosedive. this is neither an efficient, nor a feasible policy option.for perishables like onions, potatoes and tomatoes, we need more and better storage facilities, linkages with processing firms, contract farming, opening land lease markets, etc. we need to develop efficient, equitable value chains  like the amul model in dairy.but there is one problem on the agri-credit front that needs to be addressed urgently. farmers need cash immediately after harvests to pay their debts from formal and informal sources. warehouse receipt systems and giving the farmers advances against their stocks is the way to go.the biggest failure of the rbi and nabard has been on the financial inclusion front: even in 2013  the latest information we have  of the total outstanding debt of rural households, 44 per cent came from informal sources (graph 2). interest rates in the informal sector hover anywhere from 15-30 per cent.thus, instead of interest subvention schemes, the government needs to focus on financial inclusion if it wants to address farmers problems on a sustainable basis.for all the latest opinion news, download indian express app"
5a0531b79855b76bf13c00ff,The crops of wrath,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-crops-of-wrath-demonetisation-4699598/,2017-06-12,,Indian Express,"Demonetisation may not have hit agriculture production but it is the cause for the current unrest Demonetisation may not have hit agriculture production but it is the cause for the current unrestWhen demonetisation happened, many, including this writer, thought the decision, taken at the start of rabi plantings in November, would significantly impact farm production. We were proved wrong. Good monsoon rains, after successive drought years, besides the timely onset of winter conducive to germination, turned out to be strong motivations for farmers to sow, even if this entailed begging or borrowing. They successfully weathered the DeMo storm by simply replacing cash with deferred payments, for labour, purchase of seed, fertiliser and pesticides. Informal credit networks and social capital ensured that, at the end of the day, we had a bumper crop.Where demonetisation did have an impact, however, was in the prices received during harvest: Potatoes in Farrukhabad, Uttar Pradesh, fetched below Rs 350 per quintal this February, compared to Rs 600 or more last year. Moreover, while prices in 2016 had crossed Rs 1,100/quintal by mid-May, they are stuck even now at Rs 350-400. The same goes for rabi onions in Lasalgaon, Maharashtra, that traded at an average of Rs 450 per quintal in May, as against Rs 750-800 and Rs 1,200 in the same month of the preceding two years. Farmers, likewise, sold tomatoes at Kolar, Karnataka, in early May for Rs 300-400 per quintal, down from Rs 1,500-1,600 a year ago.When was the last time we saw all three  potatoes, onions and tomatoes  wholesaling at less than Rs 5/kg, and even retail prices within Rs 20/kg? And this, in peak summer! The above fire sales  the evocative term used by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its latest bimonthly monetary policy review statement  has been repeated across a range of other crops too: Garlic and methi (fenugreek) seed prices at Mandsaur  the district in Madhya Pradeshs Malwa region thats become synonymous with the ongoing farmer unrest  averaged Rs 3,400 and Rs 3,100-3,200 per quintal in April, whereas these ruled at over Rs 4,100 and Rs 4,700-4,800 respectively during the same time last year. Farmers in Nashik, which has also witnessed large-scale street action, along with the rest of Western Maharashtra, had to dump Sonaka grapes at about Rs 12 per kg in March, having sold the same green seedless variety for Rs 45 or so last year.Even more illustrative is the story of soyabean, a kharif crop that, at harvest time in November, quoted at Rs 2,800-2,900 in Indore  that price has barely moved since then, even as sowing for the new season has commenced. A similar fate has befallen arhar/tur (pigeon-pea), which realised Rs 4,300-4,500 in January-February at Gulbarga, Karnataka.That rate, already below the governments minimum support price of Rs 5,050, has fallen further to Rs 3,700-3,800 levels now. Given a choice, will any farmer plant soyabean or arhar in this kharif season?The idea behind throwing these numbers is to emphasise a fact that should be obvious: Whats going on isnt an ordinary fire sale limited to one or two commodities. This is not an isolated sugar or egg price crash, affecting only the cane grower in Muzaffarnagar and Sangli, or the layer poultry farmer of Namakkal. It is about a generalised fall in prices across agricultural commodities. Weve entered deflation territory in farm produce, whose proximate trigger clearly has been demonetisation.How? Well, much of the produce trading in India is cash-based and financed through a chain of mandi intermediaries, processors, input dealers and retailers. While difficult to establish, anecdotal reports suggest that this traditional agro-commercial capital was dealt a body blow by demonetisation. The collateral damage from it has been a haemorrhaging of liquidity from the markets. With the trade, which used to previously buy and stock up whenever prices fell, no longer active  it neither has the cash, nor the confidence now  the produce markets are suddenly without an important source of liquidity. True, this speculative capital was also a source of inflation, wherein, say, a 10 per cent production shortfall led to prices zooming 200 per cent. But today, its the opposite: A 10 per cent output increase engenders a 200 per cent price collapse.One does not know how long it would take for formal finance, banks, commodity trading houses or organised retail, to fill the void left by traditional agro-commercial capital whose transactions were largely in cash. Till that happens and liquidity truly returns, the ultimate sufferer is the farmer, evidence of which is visible in mandi prices and restive hinterlands.But even assuming demonetisations effects to be transitory, there is another elephant in the room in the form of inflation targeting. The finance ministry and the RBI, in February, 2015, signed a monetary policy framework agreement, obliging the latter to achieve an annual consumer price index (CPI) inflation target of 4 per cent, subject to a plus/minus 2 per cent band. While such inflation targeting may have been adopted by some 29 other countries, the Indian case is unique because of the sheer weight of food and non-alcoholic beverages in its CPI. At 45.86 per cent, this is way above the corresponding combined share of these items in the official CPIs of the United Kingdom (10.3 per cent), Canada (16.41 per cent) or New Zealand (18.84 per cent).Given the high weightage of agricultural products in its CPI, the success of inflation targeting in India is predicated on what happens to food prices. And since inflation at the retail and not just the wholesale level is whats being targeted, it inherently incentivises policy actions that depress farm prices (fire sales may, after all, not be all that bad a thing for the five wise men and one woman constituting the RBIs monetary policy committee). That could also explain why our policymakers today are naturally predisposed towards imposing controls on stockholding, domestic movement and export of farm goods, alongside allowing duty-free imports, at the slightest hint of a price increase  while doing nothing when produce realisations hit rock bottom.Inflation eventually isnt just a matter of the prices of goods and services going up or down. It is also about whose prices are rising and whose are falling  in other words, winners and losers. In the current deflationary environment, the farmers are the clear losers.harish.damodaran@expressindia.comFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App","demonetisation may not have hit agriculture production but it is the cause for the current unrest demonetisation may not have hit agriculture production but it is the cause for the current unrestwhen demonetisation happened, many, including this writer, thought the decision, taken at the start of rabi plantings in november, would significantly impact farm production. we were proved wrong. good monsoon rains, after successive drought years, besides the timely onset of winter conducive to germination, turned out to be strong motivations for farmers to sow, even if this entailed begging or borrowing. they successfully weathered the demo storm by simply replacing cash with deferred payments, for labour, purchase of seed, fertiliser and pesticides. informal credit networks and social capital ensured that, at the end of the day, we had a bumper crop.where demonetisation did have an impact, however, was in the prices received during harvest: potatoes in farrukhabad, uttar pradesh, fetched below rs 350 per quintal this february, compared to rs 600 or more last year. moreover, while prices in 2016 had crossed rs 1,100/quintal by mid-may, they are stuck even now at rs 350-400. the same goes for rabi onions in lasalgaon, maharashtra, that traded at an average of rs 450 per quintal in may, as against rs 750-800 and rs 1,200 in the same month of the preceding two years. farmers, likewise, sold tomatoes at kolar, karnataka, in early may for rs 300-400 per quintal, down from rs 1,500-1,600 a year ago.when was the last time we saw all three  potatoes, onions and tomatoes  wholesaling at less than rs 5/kg, and even retail prices within rs 20/kg?

Apart from the natural calamity of drought, there were man-made calamities, and this column is about how the two have brought about the explosive situation in the country.Farmers agitations are spreading across many states. It is the culmination of the acute distress in the farm sector that many observers have written and spoken about in the last two years. Two years of drought in many states was the main cause. The governments cannot be blamed for the occurrence of drought, but governments are solely responsible for the mismanagement of the consequences of drought. Apart from the natural calamity of drought, there were man-made calamities, and this column is about how the two have brought about the explosive situation in the country.The bulk of farmers in India have no choice but to do farming. Land is the only asset they have, farming is the only skill they possess, and unless they grow food many of them will face starvation. Agriculture, despite its declining share in total output (GDP), is also the largest employer. In Indias economy, the agriculture sector has primacy.The Price of NeglectUnfortunately, the NDA government lost sight of this basic truth. The agriculture portfolio is the Cinderella of this government. The Minister of Agriculture, unchanged since May 2014, is a political lightweight with little clout within the government. (How many of you can name Mr Sharad Pawars successor?). The minister has been neither seen nor heard by most people. The only memorable statement on agriculture that I can recall was when he repeated the Prime Ministers promise to double farmers income in 6 years and when asked if they had meant real income or nominal income, there was deafening silence.On the other hand, the government erred grievously on the issue of minimum support prices (MSP). In its manifesto and in the election campaign, the BJP had unequivocally promised that it would implement the M S Swaminathan Committees recommendation that MSP should be cost plus 50 per cent. In government, the BJP not only reneged on its promise, it dealt a body blow to farmers by denying them even a reasonable increase in MSP in its first three years. The numbers speak for themselves:The ostensible reason for denying a fair MSP was that higher MSP fueled inflation, which is partly true, but to lean in favour of inflation control against the interest of Indias farmer-producers was the height of folly. Some inflation is inevitable, and the government and the RBI must use other instruments to moderate inflation rather than reduce the farming community to penury.Errors galoreThe second grave error was demonetisation. Mr Harish Damodaran has convincingly demonstrated how demonetisation has crippled the post-harvest agricultural economy (see The Crops of Wrath, Indian Express, June 12, 2017). Agricultural products are bought and sold largely in cash. Demonetisation dried up liquidity and prices have crashed. According to Mr Damodaran, never before have prices of tomato, potato and onion crashed at the same time. Same is the situation with soyabean, arhar, garlic, methi (fenugreek) and grapes. Saying that farmers have resorted to fire sales, Mr Damodarans conclusion is, We have entered deflation territory in farm produce, whose proximate trigger clearly has been demonetisation.The third error was when the Prime Minister announced, on behalf of the yet-to-be-elected Uttar Pradesh government, that all farm loans in UP will be waived if the BJP formed the government. More likely, it was just an election promise in a state that the BJP perhaps did not expect to win, but it was an unequivocal promise that has returned to haunt the BJP in several states. Farm loan waivers are neither intrinsically good nor bad. As Dr M S Swaminathan said a few days ago, Loan waivers, though temporarily necessary, do not provide for a secure long term credit system (emphasis supplied). When farmers do not get a fair and reasonable price and are unable to repay their loans, they demand a loan waiver. The holder of the highest political office promised a total loan waiver, why blame the farmers for demanding that the promise be implemented?In February 2008, the fiscal situation was excellent, growth had found a new momentum, and a one-time loan forgiveness to small and medium farmers was justified. The central government was confident it could fund the waiver and so it went ahead and announced it. In 2017, however, every prudent norm was turned on its head. The Prime Minister promised a loan waiver on behalf of an yet-to-be-elected state government, no one seems to have examined the capacity of UP to bear the burden, and no one seems to have factored the fallout in other states. Having mounted a tiger, the BJP does not know how to dismount it. Meanwhile, the tiger is galloping through Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Gujarat.Jobless youth angryThe last straw was jobless growth. Young men can find no work on farms or off farms. Micro, small and medium businesses are not offering new jobs. Tier 2, 3 and 4 towns are full of jobless youth and their anger has turned against the central government. The BJP will not admit its mistakes. Nor will any BJP leader tell the Prime Minister that mistakes were made. Will the Prime Minister pull a rabbit out of the hat?

5a05df4f9855b76bf13c1831,Agitation on  say farmers  call State-wide bandh,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/agitation-on-say-farmers-call-state-wide-bandh/article18720782.ece,2017-06-05,,The Hindu,"A core committee of the Kisan Kranti Morcha, the umbrella body for agitating farmers in the State, called for a State-wide bandh on Monday as part of the ongoing farmers strike. The decision was taken at a meeting of the Morcha in Nashik on Sunday, which also said the agitation will continue till their demands for loan waivers and minimum support price are met by the government. The bandh will exclude Mumbai.In a meeting with Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday, a section of farmer leaders unilaterally announced that the strike had been called off. However, farmers in Nashik, Ahmednagar, Solapur and Western Maharashtra continued with agitation, which intensified on Sunday.At the core commitee meeting at Nashik on Sunday, farmers leaders reiterated that the strike will not be called off based on promises made by Mr Fadnavis. We want the promises to be implemented. The CM has been making these promises repeatedly for months now, Ajit Nawale, state secretary, Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha (ABKS), said.Besides an immediate waiving off of all farm loans, the Morcha has demanded that all cases against protesting farmers be withdrawn unconditionally. The committee will meet again on June 7 in Mumbai, and has organised a State-wide conference in Nashik a day later. The conference is expected to be attended by farmers leaders, where a final decision on the mode of protest will be taken. Mr. Nawale will be holding a self-introspection rally in Puntamba in Ahmednagar district, the village where the strike originated, over the alleged betrayal by the section of farmer leaders that called off the strike.Though the government had planned on keeping Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMC) on Sunday, most of them remained closed and reported a drop of nearly 60% in vehicles arriving with produce. There were protests in Nashik, Ahmednagar, Kolhapur, Aurangabad and parts of Vidarbha. theFarmer leader Jayaji Suryavanshi, accused of brokering a deal with Mr. Fadnavis and calling the strike off, faced the wrath of protesters who pelted tomatoes on his residence in Aurangabad.Meanwhile, State Revenue Minister Chandrakant Patil accused NCP chief and former Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar of doing little for farmers when his party was in power. Why is Sharad Pawar showing so much concern for farmers? His party failed to give them a minimum support price (MSP) during its 15-year rule.

5a05e6e49855b76bf13c1c20,Fault lines in the fields,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/fault-lines-in-the-fields/article18952749.ece,2017-06-10,,The Hindu,"Abhishek Patidar, 19, had just passed his Class 11 exam this year with dreams of becoming a doctor. His family owns a piece of land  about 27 bighas  in Barkheda Path, a village 22 km north of Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh where they grow soybean, methi (fenugreek) and chana (gram). On June 6, Abhishek went to Mandsaur along with hundreds of others from his village to protest against the falling crop prices that were pushing his family to the brink of desperation. Tragically, he became one of the victims of police firing, taking three bullets on a day when farmer protests across the western belt stretching from Madhya Pradesh to Maharashtra reached a frenzied pitch. He was too young but was keen to join the protest. We grow everything in our 27-bigha land but in the last three years, prices have plunged and ruined us, says Abhisheks father, Dinesh Patidar, 55, tears rolling down his eyes.Price pinch in MalwaBarkheda Path is typical of the villages in this region. With an approximate population of 3,500, 95% of the population is engaged in farming in landholdings that are less than a hectare per family. Abhisheks family members narrate their tale of loss. The last three years have crushed our backbone because prices have plunged, forcing us to sell our produce at rates where we dont even recover our investment, says Dinesh, adding, todays market price for soybean is Rs. 2,500-2,700 per quintal while our cost to produce one quintal is above Rs. 3,000. Not only soybean, prices of onion, gram, methi , vegetables, milk have bottomed while input costs have soared for seeds, fertilizers, labour and transport, he says.Madhya Pradesh consistently boasts of double-digit growth in agriculture  averaging 13.9% during 2010-15  and like many other States, had a bumper harvest following a good monsoon in 2016. Yet as per the National Crime Records Bureau statistics, as many as 1,982 farmers committed suicide in the State in 2016-17. A combination of factors  falling procurement prices because of a glut of produce in the market, a cash crunch due to last years demonetisation policy and the predominance of smaller landholdings which are expensive to maintain  have led to a simmering anger. Like their counterparts in many parts of Maharashtra, farmers in Mandsaur launched an agitation demanding remunerative prices for their onion, soybean and pulses. As thousands of farmers poured onto the streets, stopping traffic, attacking trucks and confronting police, things turned violent and five farmers were killed as a result of police firing and a curfew was imposed across five districts.Farmers from the Mandsaur-Neemuch stretch in the Malwa region, aside from growing soybean and chana, also grow a range of spices and medicinal plants like methi , dhaniya (coriander), jeera (cumin) and ajwain (carom seeds). Yet, farmers in the region claim that prices for these cash crops have been falling for the past few years. We never sold methi below Rs. 4,000 per quintal during the Manmohan Singhs government. But ever since Modi became PM, methi prices have collapsed, says Dinesh, showing methi gunny bags stored in his house.In addition to low prices, what has aggravated the situation is the Central governments demonetisation move late last year that has adversely hit the rural and agrarian economy.  Notebandi has almost finished us in the rural areas. Even after selling our produce, we dont get money in our hands before at least two-three weeks and sometimes even a month, says Lalchand Mali, a farmer from Barkheda Panth.Interestingly, not many farmers in the region are seeking loan waiver as is being claimed in the media. Most of them want better and remunerative prices that cover their costs and provide them income for survival. Believe me, no true farmer would want loan waiver. If the government provides better prices, we will repay our debt. The problem is the government never provides better prices, adds Lalchand, who owns a two-hectare plot in the village.The Maharashtra stirIn the town of Niphad in Maharashtras Nashik district, the main vegetable market, located in a large yard opposite the tehsil office, lies deserted. In a series of godowns that lie adjacent to the yard there is a pink gleam as sunlight filters through to large sacks of onions that are waiting to be transported. In Vittal Sanaps godown, which is nearly packed to capacity with produce, a large truck with a tarpaulin cover has been parked inside for three days even as workers go about their usual task of loading onions into bright red sacks.We had an order for onions to go to Madras (Chennai) a few days back but the truck was accosted on the road before it could get to Nashik and all the onions were dumped on the road, says Sanap. Onions that are left at the mercy of the elements lose their value almost immediately, so for now Sanap is just waiting for things to tide over. The hartal (strike) will have to end soon because there are many farmers who have no choice but to sell their goods even if prices are bad.Onions and other vegetables from godowns like Sanaps go to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) market in Nashik from where they are taken to other cities in Maharashtra like Mumbai and Pune as well as to other States in the south like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, and even Sri Lanka. The APMC market in Nashik is appropriately mammoth  on either side of a dusty road are two large open halls, each the size of a large bus terminus with tall pillars running right through. On June 8, a day after the one-week strike called by farmers in the region officially ended, a small group of women have set up shop to sell vegetables like cabbage, chillies, tomatoes and cucumber. They take up barely a quarter of one hall but as produce is brought in by farmers in smaller trucks, there are murmurs of anger outside with some arguments breaking out as the produce is passed inside. These women are not from Maharashtra, you can tell from their earrings that they are from Rajasthan. These are just small local farmers who want to break the strike, says one of the men. Still, even these small traces of activity raise the suspicion that divisions are beginning to form in what was till now a unified movement in the district.United in adversityAs the major commercial supplier in this region, Nashik may have become the epicentre of the farmers movement but it all started in a village called Puntamba in Ahmednagar district three months ago on April 3, when the villages gram panchayat passed a resolution warning of a Shetkari Sampa (Strike of the Ryots) from June 1. Their charter of demands addressed to Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis included ensuring crop procurement prices at least 50% above production costs, a complete waiver of farm loans, 100% subsidy on drip/sprinkler irrigation systems, and a minimum milk purchase price of Rs. 50.Farmers across the region may find a specific resonance in one or the other of these demands but what seems to have really helped the movement spread from Puntamba across the Nashik-Ahmednagar-Pune stretch of Maharashtra is the language in which the idea of the strike was communicated. Farmers face many hardships but this was the first time Ive seen farmers actually willing to go on strike to and risk everything to see that they are given some recognition, says Abhijit Dige, who owns an eight-acre farm about 60 km from Nashik. Politicians dont know what farmers go through, its not like other businesses. Devendra Fadnavis should come and work in the field for 14 hours a day, work at night in the cold to tend to onion crops, and then maybe hell understand, he says.That same sentiment is echoed by Deepak Rane who has a one-acre farm just off Niphad where he grows cauliflower. The strike should not stop because people dont realise what we go through. I am not able to recover the cost that I bear to treat my crops with chemicals and fertilizers. I work from 6 in the morning; what is it all for? he says.People from all walks of life face hardships but have you ever considered why it is only farmer suicides you have heard of? asks Dinesh Nikam, another trader in Nashik who has refused to take orders for onions and other vegetables because he says he stands in solidarity with the farmers.The illusion of prosperityWhen farm distress was first reported in Maharashtra, it focussed mainly on the prices of tur and arhar dal and the difficulties faced by farmers in the drought-prone Marathwada and Amaravati regions. After two years of consecutive drought, a good monsoon in 2016 brought in a bountiful harvest and the markets were simply swamped with produce. Record harvests were offset by a steep fall in procurement prices for both crops.The plight of those farmers is often referenced by prominent leaders of the movement in Nashik and Ahmednagar though it has to be noted that this region is substantially different. The stretch from Ahmednagar to Nashik, and down to Kolhapur and Sangli where the movement spread is a fairly contiguous belt that is home to relatively more prosperous farmers. The majority of farmers in the region over the past two decades have moved from cultivation of crops like bajra (pearl millet) and jowar (sorghum) to cash crops like grapes and onions. Many have invested in dairy farming (Puntamba, for instance, is home to many dairy farmers).Vegetables, then, are actually only a small part of the produce from this region and while the enduring visual images of the strike may be of vegetables like cauliflower and cabbage being dumped on the road, there are many places where people show us pictures shot on cell phones of roads lined with pomegranates, which is the most recent entry to the crop market here.In Italy, for instance, a village about 10 km from Niphad that was the one of the centres of the agitation, Swarupananda Bhorgade says that about 80% of the village of 5,000-odd farmers is involved in grape farming, sometimes done in rotation with onions. I have been growing grapes for the last 20 years and till about seven or eight years ago I used to sell it for about Rs. 50 a kilo, says Bhorgade. So it was only natural that I planted grapes on every inch of my 15 acres. Now it costs me about Rs. 15 to harvest a kilo of grapes and all I can get on the market is Rs. 9 to Rs. 18 a kilo, he says.Bhorgade attributes this to a number of factors, the most important of which is climate  storms would come unseasonably and the crops would be destroyed. Or there would be hailstorms. This past year, the weather was regular and the crop was good for once but there is no price. You have to take into account how much we have spent on growing these crops and how we will recover it. It costs a lot to invest in crops like grapes and pomegranates, he says, adding that farmers from the region initially tried to rope in their counterparts from Amaravati who grew tur dal but their situation was completely different. They have larger landholdings and their crop is rain-fed. They dont have to spend on irrigation and other chemicals and fertilizer like we do.On June 3, a faction of farmer leaders decided to call off the strike after Mr. Fadnavis announced a partial loan waiver for small and marginal farmers that would come into effect on October 31. In a large meeting on June 8 in Nashik that included about 3,000 farmers and 150 representatives of farmer associations from across the State, that compromise was rejected. The people who met the Chief Minister did so late at night without anybody knowing and the agreement was not along the lines of what we were originally demanding, said Raju Shetti, president of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana that has taken a major role in advancing the agenda. If the government did not accede to the demand to waive all loans immediately and bump up procurement prices, the meeting decided that the strike would move to a new phase of hartals across district and collectors offices from June 12 and rail rokos  in some areas. As of June 8, the meeting concluded that farmers should be allowed to take their produce to the market in order to meet their minimum needs. Look for Puntamba on that day (June 12), says one of the farmers who attended the meeting. The first rail roko will be there, where it all started.","abhishek patidar, 19, had just passed his class 11 exam this year with dreams of becoming a doctor. his family owns a piece of land  about 27

5a05ee649855b76bf13c2017,The best of times  the worst of times,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-best-of-times-the-worst-of-times/article19034516.ece,2017-06-14,,The Hindu,"The ongoing farmers agitation has taken on a shockingly violent form. Discussion has revolved around an apparent paradox: why are farmers rioting after a bumper crop? But any student of economics knows that prices fall after bumper harvests, which is good for consumers but terrible for farmers. This is why the government needs to step in to buy from farmers at a minimum support price, while subsidising consumers so that they get affordable food. This is what we have done over the last fifty years after setting up the Food Corporation of India (FCI) in 1965.If this system has been in place for so long, why are we still lurching from crisis to crisis? For long, we have said that the solution is to get people off farming. While there is no doubt we need to create more jobs in manufacturing, we must not forget that even in the year 2050, according to the latest projections, there will still be 800 million people living in rural India. And just one look at the state of Indian cities makes it clear that endlessly moving people from villages to cities could actually deepen the urban imbroglio. So solutions have to be found for agriculture  and fast.Use and abuse of soil, waterThe problem with Indian agriculture is that we are still stuck with the so-called Green Revolution of the 1970s. I use the prefix so-called for a specific reason. Yes, there was a dramatic rise in food production. And India no longer needs to beg for food in the world market. But this was primarily a rice and wheat revolution. It completely neglected two-thirds of Indian agriculture and crops grown and eaten by the poorest people of our country  pulses and millets. There is also nothing green about this revolution because, over the years, it has caused a deep crisis of sustainability, economic and ecological. Large-scale use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides has had an extremely adverse impact on our soil and water. Deep drilling by tubewells to grow these water-intensive crops has happened without any reference whatsoever to Indias unique hydrogeology, where nearly two-thirds of our land is underlain by hard rock formations which have very low rates of natural recharge.This has meant that there is now a serious water crisis, with both water tables and water quality falling rapidly. We have arsenic, fluoride, mercury, even uranium in our drinking water, creating serious health issues. What is worse, to get the same increase in production, farmers have had to apply more and more fertilisers and pesticides over time. This dramatically raises costs of cultivation, without a proportionate increase in production. More than 3,00,000 farmers have committed suicide over the last two decades, which has absolutely no precedent in Indian history.Sustainable agricultureSo what can we do to address these twin tragedies of suicides and violence by farmers? First, we need to transition to a more ecologically resilient agriculture. This becomes even more urgent in the context of climate change. Large-scale evidence now exists that non-chemical agriculture has become a profitable alternative. As farmers reduce their dependence on synthetic fertilisers and pesticides, they slowly emerge from the ecological vicious cycle and are also able to dramatically reduce their costs of cultivation, without compromising on production. The biggest votary of non-chemical farming is the Prime Minister himself. He has also launched the Soil Health Card Scheme, which potentially enables farmers to more carefully manage input regimes. The government must announce a comprehensive package to give a green direction to the nature of subsidies in the sector.Second, we must radically reform the management of both surface and groundwater to ensure that the water in our irrigation commands reaches the farmers for whom it is meant and groundwater is managed sustainably in a way that ensures that no one is deprived of their right to water for life. There is positive movement in both these directions within government except for some hesitation in going ahead with a new model groundwater Bill drafted by the Ministry of Water Resources. This landmark Bill seeks to replace archaic British Common Law from the 19th century, which has provided legal legitimacy to the over-extraction of groundwater that underpins the current agrarian crisis. The new law needs urgent adoption and advocacy with the States by the Government of India.On diversificationThird, we require continued diversification to other forms of livelihood, such as livestock and fisheries, among the fastest-growing segments of the rural economy, which could be hurt by recent policy changes. We must also shift focus away from water-intensive rice and wheat. This means radical changes in the way we grow these crops (seed, water and input regimes) but also much greater encouragement to millets and pulses, which are nutritionally far superior alternatives in a country beset with the diabetes epidemic. The key change required here is aggressive and extensive procurement of these crops by the government. FCI procurement focusses only on rice and wheat although this year we saw some initial steps in the direction of procurement of pulses. This is a welcome move but needs to go much further. The best way would be to include millets and pulses in the massive anganwadi and mid-day meal programmes.Fourth, investments in agro-processing infrastructure are urgently required that would enable farmers to move up the value chain. We cannot continue to have them dumping their vegetables and milk on the road. They should be processed before they are sold and farmers must get their due share in the value chain.Fifth, we need to ensure access to credit and crop insurance, especially to our 85% small and marginal farmers. This is why I am strongly opposed to farm loan waivers as they destroy the integrity of the banking system and potentially undermine the extraordinary anti-poverty initiative led by Self-Help Groups (SHGs) of women across the country. So many of these extremely poor women, with more than 97% loan recovery ratios, have helped the banking system survive in remote rural India. All this great work of providing an alternative to the usurious moneylender-traders is threatened by loan waivers.Finally, we need strong Farmer Producer Organisations, to overcome massive handicaps faced by isolated farmers and enable them to really benefit from market participation.Demonetisation crunchWhile many cumulative factors have taken a toll on farmers over decades, more proximate factors explain the outbreak of extreme violence. Speaking to farmers and traders, it appears that demonetisation squeezed so much liquidity out of the system that traders did not have requisite cash to buy the farmers produce. Farmers also feel that persisting with imports, even after clear signs of a bumper harvest, further depressed prices. Having lived in remote rural Madhya Pradesh for the last three decades, I do not recall a crash in prices as dramatic as this years, that too in the peak of summer. In Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka, prices of tuar, gram, soybean, grapes, potatoes, onions, tomatoes, milk, garlic, cumin, coriander and fenugreek are at historical lows. And when this happens in crops with high costs of cultivation and inadequate government support, the impact is catastrophic, leading to what the Reserve Bank of India has called fire sales. Which has also created apprehensions about kharif sowing. No wonder the farmers are upset.Violence shows no way forward. But this is a juncture agrarian policy reform in India cannot afford to ignore. Only a comprehensive policy response can ensure that farmers distress becomes a thing of the past.Mihir Shah, a member of the erstwhile Planning Commission, has lived in remote rural Madhya Pradesh for the last three decades, working on issues of water and livelihood security","the ongoing farmers agitation has taken on a shockingly violent form. discussion has revolved around an apparent paradox: why are farmers rioting after a bumper crop? but any student of economics knows that prices fall after bumper harvests, which is good for consumers but terrible for farmers. this is why the government needs to step in to buy from farmers at a minimum support price, while subsidising consumers so that they get affordable food. this is what we have done over the last fifty years after setting up the food corporation of india (fci) in 1965.if this system has been in place for so long, why are we still lurching from crisis to crisis? for long, we have said that the solution is to get people off farming. while there is no doubt we need to create more jobs in manufacturing, we must not forget that even in the year 2050, according to the latest projections, there will still be 800 million people living in rural india. and just one look at the state of indian cities makes it clear that endlessly moving people from villages to cities could actually deepen the urban imbroglio. so solutions have to be found for agriculture  and fast.use and abuse of soil, waterthe problem with indian agriculture is that we are still stuck with the so-called green revolution of the 1970s. i use the prefix so-called for a specific reason. yes, there was a dramatic rise in food production. and india no longer needs to beg for food in the world market. but this was primarily a rice and wheat revolution. it completely neglected two-thirds of indian agriculture and crops grown and eaten by the poorest people of our country  pulses and millets. there is also nothing green about this revolution because, over the years, it has caused a deep crisis of sustainability, economic and ecological. large-scale use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides has had an extremely adverse impact

5a060e0f9855b76bf13c343c,Why you don’t feel the record-low inflation,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/why-you-dont-feel-the-record-low-inflation/article19100813.ece,2017-06-19,,The Hindu,"It is not just RBIs forecasters who are likely to be scratching their heads after the release of Indias latest retail inflation numbers for May 2017. Aam aadmi is quite bewildered too. The data shows that the inflation rate, measured by the Consumer Price Index (Combined  new series) was 2.2% for May 2017, slipping from a 3% reading for April which everyone thought was the rock-bottom. The food component of the index actually deflated by 1.1%.A CPI inflation rate below 2.5% is a once-in-a-blue-moon occurrence in India. Looking back at the history of the CPI  Industrial Workers (the older avatar of the index which has a longer history), we find that India has registered CPI inflation of less than 2.5% only in 12 months in 20 years.But if retail inflation is at a stand-still, how come most of us dont feel it? Shouldnt this be boosting our purchasing power and visibly fattening our wallets?There are three reasons why your personal experience with price rise may not gel with the official reading.Where you liveIf you live in Jammu & Kashmir, Puducherry or Sikkim, the inflation rates in your household budget may bear no resemblance to the headline inflation number.This is because the All-India CPI Combined is compiled by collecting town and village-level data on the prices of goods and services across States and then aggregating them.Now, all States and Union Territories do not get equal weighting in the total. The weights are decided by the consumption expenditure within each State relative to the all-India consumption basket. While the State of Maharashtra gets a 13.2% weight in the all-India CPI (Combined), J&K weighs in with just 0.94%, Puducherry with 0.17% and Sikkim with 0.05%.In effect, price trends at Maharashtra carry nearly 260 times the influence that Sikkim carries in deciding the final CPI number. Runaway inflation in Indias less populous low-spend States and Union Territories is unlikely to show up in the form of a big swing in the overall index. But even small blips in the States of Maharashtra (13.1% weight), UP (12.4%) and Tamil Nadu (7.3%) can swing the headline number.This is why, in May 2017, CPI inflation at J&K (6.3%), Delhi (5.1%) and Himachal Pradesh (4.7%) ruled at many times the all-India reading of 2.2%.Consumption basketDoes 45.8% of your monthly household budget go towards food and groceries? Would house rent makeup just 10.1%? Do you fritter away 2.4% on tobacco and intoxicants? If not, the inflation in your household is likely to be very different from the official inflation rate.In order to arrive at a CPI General Index that is representative of both India and Bharat, the statistics office assigns different weights to the different products and services. These weights are derived from the actual spending patterns of rural and urban households as captured by the NSSOs ground-level survey of expenditure patterns across India. The latest such survey was the 68th round conducted over 2011-12. (See graphic).Because the majority of Indian households belong to lower-income strata, the CPI General Index thus carries a far higher weight to products than services.Services often witness higher price rise than products in the Indian context. But in practise, more affluent households will tend to spend a far lower proportion of their income on food and essentials and make a higher allocation to non-essentials and services.One-offsThe official CPI print captures the point-to-point change in the index in the latest month, compared to the same month last year. This makes the number susceptible to distortions from one-off factors both in the base month and in the current one.The CPI inflation rate for May 2017 has, for instance, been suppressed by the base effect. As we know, a bountiful monsoon this year has led to a bumper production of pulses, oilseeds and horticultural crops. This has triggered a rout in agri-commodities ranging from tur and urad dal to potatoes, onions and tomatoes, prompting farmers to protest. Agri-market watchers also add that the note ban and GST impact on the agri-supply chain have led to poor offtake and offloading of stock, thus adding to this downward spiral.But a fall in retail food prices at this time of the year is quite a one-off situation. Every year, food prices usually soar in the months of April-May as they represent the pre-monsoon months when food crops are in short supply. In May last year, for instance, two consecutive poor monsoon years had fuelled a sharp flare-up in the prices of pulses, oilseeds, vegetables and spices. In May 2016, therefore the item-wise breakdown of CPI showed the prices of pulses up 33% (year-on-year), vegetables higher by 10% and spices rising 9%.But in May 2017, the respective CPI index for vegetables was down by 13%, that for pulses had plunged 15% and fruits and oils were up by just 1-2% compared to the same time last year.If we ignore the monthly numbers and focus on three-year trends instead, we find that price levels have continued to creep up steadily. Between May 2014 and now, the CPI Combined has risen at an annual 4.5%.Food prices in this span have climbed 4.1%. In the preceding three-year span from 2011 to 2014, the CPI Combined had soared 9.6% and the CPI Food Index 10.9%.In short, yes, inflation has moderated of late, but for most middle class folk, it is likely to be higher than 2.2%. To get a real feel of your personal inflation rate, you should check out CPI trends in your State of residence, and in the products and services that make up the lions share of your budget.If we focus on three-year trends, we find that price levels have gone up steadily","it is not just rbis forecasters who are likely to be scratching their heads after the release of indias latest retail inflation numbers for may 2017. aam aadmi is quite bewildered too. the data shows that the inflation rate, measured by the consumer price index (combined  new series) was 2.2% for may 2017, slipping from a 3% reading for april which everyone thought was the rock-bottom. the food component of the index actually deflated by 1.1%.a cpi inflation rate below 2.5% is a once-in-a-blue-moon occurrence in india. looking back at the history of the cpi  industrial workers (the older avatar of the index which has a longer history), we find that india has registered cpi inflation of less than 2.5% only in 12 months in 20 years.but if retail inflation is at a stand-still, how come most of us dont feel it? shouldnt this be boosting our purchasing power and visibly fattening our wallets?there are three reasons why your personal experience with price rise may not gel with the official reading.where you liveif you live in jammu & kashmir, puducherry or sikkim, the inflation rates in your household budget may bear no resemblance to the headline inflation number.this is because the all-india cpi combined is compiled by collecting town and village-level data on the prices of goods and services across states and then aggregating them.now, all states and union territories do not get equal weighting in the total. the weights are decided by the consumption expenditure within each state relative to the all-india consumption basket. while the state of maharashtra gets a 13.2% weight in the all-india cpi (combined), j&k weighs in with just 0.94%, puducherry with 0.17% and sikkim with 0.05%.in effect, price trends at maharashtra carry nearly 260 times the influence that sikkim carries in deciding the final cpi number. runaway inflation in indias less populous low-spend states and union territories is unlikely to show up in the form of a big swing in the overall index. but even small blips in the states of maharashtra (13.1% weight), up (12.4%) and tamil nadu (7.3%) can swing the headline number.this is why, in may 2017, cpi inflation at j&k (6.3%), delhi (5.1%) and himachal pradesh (4.7%) ruled at many times the all-india reading of 2.2%.consumption basketdoes 45.8% of your monthly household budget go towards food and groceries? would house rent makeup just 10.1%? do you fritter away 2.4% on tobacco and intoxicants? if not, the inflation in your household is likely to be very different from the official inflation rate.in order to arrive at a cpi general index that is representative of both india and bharat, the statistics office assigns different weights to the different products and services. these weights are derived from the actual spending patterns of rural and urban households as captured by the nssos ground-level survey of expenditure patterns across india. the latest such survey was the 68th round conducted over 2011-12.

The avocado, once happily married to onion, tomato, cilantro and lemon juice, in the humble guacamole, is the latest to get upwardly mobile. It has found its way from the first course in swanky eateries to the last. You can have it smashed, pulped, frozen, charred, tossed in a salad or blended into a shake.Hip millennials have raised its demand to the point where the avocado has become hot rather than humble, and its price point in India is comparable to anywhere in the world.In Mumbai to showcase the versatility of this ingredient is Australian chef Scott Pickett. In two varied techniques, Pickett shows that the avocado can be made to obey any instruction. It can excite your palate and fuel taste buds when simply charred and served with olive oil and salt or sugar. Conversely, it can cool you off at the end of a meal when whipped into a chocolate mousse and served with berries and cherries. Says Pickett, When you use it to make ice cream, you are replacing milk-based fat content with avocado.With great power comes talkThe avocados status as a superfood has made it a talking point over the last year, and not just in Australia alone.As Pickett observes, With the world being so much closer, thanks to social media and the Internet, superfoods that are popular become a simultaneous trend the world over.This is why, there are at least two avocado-themed restaurants worth mention. Amsterdam has locals and tourists mad for The Avocado Show, while Brooklyn, New York, has the Avocaderia. Both restaurants serve up avocado halves in place of burger buns in their burger, while the former even pairs it with hummus and toast, in a nod to the popular smashed avocado on toast. Theres avocado in side dishes as well  trussed up with truffles and oils, served with salmon and caviar, and even married into a burrata.Much as Pickett loves avocado, he isnt keen on forcing it into every bite you take at any of his four Melbourne restaurants.Reining in the fad, he says, I think there is a place for everything. It can definitely be part of a meal, but Im not sure if I would like everything avocado.Experimental muchSpeaking of how chefs and foodies are playing with their food in Australias foodie state of Victoria, where Pickett is from, he says that the lack of an established culinary history (like India has) means that the treatment of ingredients is always under scrutiny.Whos to say what ready means when it comes to avocado? We are actively developing ways to cook and use the fruit at different stages of readiness. If its firm, charring works great, and served as a side with the main meal.A ripple set off in Australia last year made waves all the way to the front pages of western media when Australian columnist Bernard Salt wrote that millennials were unable to afford homes because they were spending $20 on avocado on toast. The furore this generated across oceans simply had more people lining up to see what the fuss was all about. Smashed avocado gained street cred in kitchens everywhere. Now, the time is right, feels Pickett, to take the interest into creating dishes beyond his beloved smashed avocado on toast.Trend mentalityHe wouldnt go as far as the avo-latte though, which is a regular latte served in the skin of an avocado. It was created as a joke in Melbourne before cafs around the world sincerely followed suit. They missed the joke, grins Pickett. Doctors in the UK  where sales of the fruit shot up over the last year  have even coined a new condition called avo hand for the injury sustained from cutting avocados.While the most popular variety of avocado sold is called Hass  named after the American postal worker Rudolph Hass  the latest variety that everyones excited about is the Teeny Tiny Avocado, developed by Trader Joes. Its lime-sized, ripens faster than your regular avocado, and is a perfect single serving. However, it hasnt made its way to your local grocerToo much of anythingAs for that fat content some people worry about, says Pickett, too much of anything is bad. And that is why the avocado too must be only one of the many things you eat. Its health benefits also outweigh the perceived negatives.

The 25-year-old chef heads operations at Le Cirque Signature, at the Leela Mumbai and has created a special food and wine trail thats been inspired by his hometown, Lucca in Tuscany near Florence. The menu includes several family recipes. On Sundays, after mass, my mother would buy fresh seafood and make gamberoni, baked prawns in orange lemon base, Severini cheerfully shares with us.For the chef, Tuscany is the fragrance of rosemary and thyme. And, pecorini reminds me of home, which I havent been in six years, and beef, he grins. Native Tuscans eat simple food, vegetables grown in their backyard, herbs collected from mountains and fresh catch from the sea. They rarely use eggs in their food and their bread is baked without salt. Thats because our cuisine is very powerful. The only challenge I face here is the [in]consistent availability of ingredients. I usually create menus depending on whats available. So many laws change overnight, I cant keep up, he quips, telling us about the one time his vegetables got caught in customs. They were stale by the time I got my hands on them. I sent them back! he exclaims.After a hearty chat, he leaves us to try the food, starting our journey with two types of bruschetta delloste (Rs 1,050). One is a raw tomato, and the other a herby porcini on a pillowy polenta with has a crisp coating. The tomato needs seasoning but the porcini is juicy and gets the taste buds going. The cacciucco alla viareggina (Rs 1050), a seafood soup, has clams, oysters, prawn and chunks of fish in a thick broth which we wash down with a watery Merlot Dazante from the region.In a chat with us, Severini had expressed his concern about creating vegetarian dishes but it feels like needless worry when we taste the gnudi senesi (Rs 1,250). The no-frills dish is a ricotta spinach gnocchi on a bed of tomato puree that woos the palate with every bite. This is how we eat it at home, Severini quips. Next up is tordelli lucchesi rewind (Rs 1,650), is lamb ravioli with a lamb ragout. We savour this with a sangiovese cabernet sauvignon, Castello Banfi.The sommelier for the evening, Margaux Pavoncello, tells us about French grapes that were planted in Tuscan region, giving the wine a distinct character, acquired from the terra. The weather and soil play a very important part in the flavour, she explains, as we sip the medium bodied wine.For our mains, the vegetarians dish is fagotto Florentino (Rs 1,150). The name gets the Florentino title owing to the spinach stuffed in a filo pastry shell with mushrooms. The second dish is the recipe that Severini has borrowed from his mother, the gamberoni arrosto (Rs 2,150) in which succulent prawns sit on orange and lemon mayonnaise base, which gives the dish a much-needed citrusy lift. We wish there was more of this sauce though. A Sangiovese Cabernet Merlot matches the dish, and is a whole bodied, woody experience. While the food shouts Italian yet none of the dishes are clichd presentations. There is barely any use of basil, and its a pleasant change to eat robust Italian dishes.Severini joins us for the dessert course which is cantucci e vin santo (Rs 750). For the custard, I break a Tuscan cigar, which is second best after a Cuban roll, and add it in the food smoking gun, he explains. What looks like slices of bread are cookies kneaded with dryfruits. The server pours the custard, which comes in a thick sauce consistency, over it. The burnt flavour lingers in our mouth, gently offering sweet solace from the cookie in every bite.

Israel also assisted India during two wars with Pakistan in 1965 and 1971.India reciprocated during the six-day war in 1967 by providing Israel with spare parts for French-made Mystere and Ouragan aircraft as well as AX-13 tanks (also French-made).The highlight of the partnership was Israel's supply of artillery shells during the Kargil war in 1999 when India faced a shortage.In the late 1990s, a crucial defence deal was the Indian purchase of Barak 1, an air-defence missile, bought specifically for its capability to intercept US-made Harpoon missiles deployed by Pakistan.India's imports of unarmed aerial vehicles (UAVs) have almost all been from Israel. Of 176 UAVs purchased from Israel, 108 are Searcher UAVs and 68 are Heron UAVs.In April 2017, India and Israel signed a $2 billion deal for an advanced medium-range surface-to-air missile system, which will provide the Indian army the capability to shoot down aircraft, missiles and drones at ranges of up to 70 km.In September 2016, tests were conducted of the jointly developed Long Range Surface-to-Air Missile with a range of 70 km, intended to equip three guided-missile destroyers of the Indian Navy.India successfully tested the Israeli-made SPYDER quick-reaction surface-to-air missile in May this year. The Indian Air Force (IAF) is planning to deploy this system on its western border.India and Israel also closely cooperate on counter-terrorism issues through a joint working group on counter-terrorism.Diplomacy: Several ministerial and high-level official visits to Israel preceded Modi's tour. These included visits by then Home Minister L.K. Advani in 2000, former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam in 2008, Home Minister Rajnath Singh in 2014, President Pranab Mukherjee in 2015 and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj in 2016.Three Indian naval ships, destroyer INS Mumbai, frigate INS Trishul and tanker INS Aditya, made a goodwill visit at the Haifa port in May 2017 to mark 25 years of full diplomatic relations between the two countries.Agriculture: An Indo-Israel agriculture action plan for 2015-18 is operational, and 15 of the proposed 26 centres of excellence in agriculture are being developed in India with Israel's help to showcase the latest technology to Indian farmers.Phase-I (2010-12) and phase-II (2012-15) of the agreement are complete, according to a reply to the Lok Sabha.India has benefited from Israeli technologies in horticulture mechanisation, protected cultivation, orchard and canopy management, nursery management, micro-irrigation and post-harvest management, particularly in Haryana and Maharashtra.Every year, more than 20,000 farmers visit the Agricultural Centre of Excellence at Gharaunda in Karnal, Haryana, where a nursery produces hybrid seedlings -- including tomatoes, cherry-tomato, colored capsicum, cucumbers, eggplant and chilli pepper-grown in small, individual cells, ready to be transplanted into containers or a field.There was a five-to 10-fold increase in crop yields with an accompanying 65 per cent reduction in use of water and noticeable decrease in the use of pesticides and fertilisers, according to a December 2014 report on the Indo-Israel Agriculture Project.Water Management: On June 28, 2017, the Union cabinet approved a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Israel on the National Campaign for Water Conservation in India.Technologically-adept Israel has developed water-management technologies, located as it is in a semi-arid region with limited sources of fresh drinking water.India and Israel had earlier signed an MoU on water resources management and development cooperation in November 2016.Trade: Israel was India's 38th-largest trading partner, with trade of $5.02 billion (Rs 33,634 crore) in 2016-17, down 18 per cent over 2012-13. The trade balance stood in India's favour at $1.10 billion (Rs 7,370 crore) in 2016-17.Mineral fuels and oils are India's leading export to Israel, worth $1.01 billion in 2016-17.India's major imports from Israel in 2016-17 included natural or cultured pearls and precious stones, worth $1.11 billion.Trade in diamonds accounts for nearly 54 per cent of the bilateral trade. Nearly 40 diamond dealers from India have opened offices at the Israeli diamond exchange in Ramat-Gan. Some of these dealers have been active in Israel for nearly 30-40 years.The Israeli government has proposed measures such as ""offering export insurance, liberalising the aviation sector and granting longer-term visas"".

I have been working at Chap Chay, The Raintree Hotel, for about six months now.I have been exposed to different varieties of food since my childhood. I have always understood and loved different cuisines and flavours. My brother and the chefs I have worked with in the last 12 years have inspired me.

From Mumbai I learnt Japanese cuisine, a couple of Thai dishes from Bengaluru, from Chennai I learnt a lot of Chinese dishes and from Kolkata I picked up a couple of Cantonese dishes. So every place has made me a better chef and has taught me a lot. My specialities however are my Japanese, Chinese and Thai food.Each cuisine stands apart in terms of authentic flavouring. For example, we use a lot of tangy flavours in Shanghai food and in Cantonese and Chinese dishes we use very little spice. But we adjust the flavours as per the taste of the customers. In Chennai, people prefer more spices and tanginess, so even the authentic Chinese flavours have to be changed.I think my best and also my favourite dishes are dimsums. I also did a dimsum festival at the hotel recently. I love experimenting with dimsums and create new flavours. Broccoli and cheese dimsums, scallop and prawn dimsums, pork bun dimsum, beef dimsums are some of my most favourite varieties. I try out different varieties because nowadays people look for new and unique flavours.I have received a lot of appreciation for my broccoli and cheese dimsums.

(Express/Narendra Vaskar) With kharif sowing already at the half-way mark, farmers say the fresh loan may just come too late. (Express/Narendra Vaskar)Even as the Maharashtra government extended the countrys biggest ever loan waiver package to cover an even greater number of farmers by including all overdue crop loans disbursed since 2009, farmers across the state are reporting their inability to access fresh credit.Amid doubts over conditions imposed for eligibility for the loan waiver, and with the cooperative banking network in deep crisis, farmers have been unable to access any institutional credit more than a fortnight after Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis announced that a fresh line of credit worth Rs 10,000 would be made available immediately to all eligible farmers. And with sowing for the kharif season already at the half-way mark, farmers in regions that have witnessed acute agrarian distress over the past three to four years say the fresh loan of Rs 10,000 may just come too late.Nivrutti Gangurde of Kotamgaon village in Nashiks Niphad taluka had earlier in the year taken a loan of Rs 2 lakh for his daughters wedding. Unable to raise a fresh crop loan as he was unable to clear previous dues, he had to borrow informally from somebody in the village, at higher rates of interest, for the kharif season. I have been overdue since 2014  none of the banks was ready to sanction any loan. In order to meet the operational expenses for my acre of tomato I had to borrow around Rs 2 lakh from a moneylender this year, he says.For Maharashtras farmers now, there is water but no liquidity In Tuljapur talukas Salgara Devti village in Osmanabad district, farmer and postwoman Archana Bhosale says everyone is being turned away from the local bank. Similarly, in Nandurghat village of Beed, local journalist and farmer Amol Jadhav says those visiting the Maharashtra Gramin Bank branch have been told instructions regarding fresh credit havent arrived yet.Across the state, lead bank managers for agricultural loans say the fresh loan of Rs 10,000 promised by the government cannot be extended in the current circumstances where eligibility criteria have been repeatedly tweaked since the announcement and with no master circular from the Reserve Bank of India to all banks on writing off crop loan accounts that are non-performing assets (NPAs) or bad loans.The government and the RBI will have to clearly state which NPAs are to be written off, only then can fresh credit be offered. And banks have seen next to zero recovery ever since the loan waiver demand began to pick up. With nobody making payments on old loans and with no detailed intimation from the government on how to proceed, local banks actually cannot offer fresh loans to anyone, though there are requests every day, says the lead bank manager in one of Marathwadas districts. The Maharashtra Gramin Bank, a regional rural bank, is the only one to have issued a circular to its branches on the loan waiver and fresh credit, but sources say disbursals have remained very low despite demand.The Gramin Bank services 17 districts, including all of Marathwada where the district central cooperative banks are mostly weak or defunct. Chief Manager for Credit and Refinance K D Joshi says a circular was issued as per the directives of the state government to all 408 branches, but concedes that there is confusion regarding eligibility. The criteria are changing daily. Now all loans disbursed since 2009 that are overdue as of June 30, 2016 are eligible, but the government has not issued a circular about this. Until there is a firm eligibility criterion, some confusion will remain, he told The Indian Express.Other bankers say farmers are also a confused lot, some hoping to have multiple loans in multiple banks written off, others simply unaware of the conditions to be fulfilled before the mortgage record can be wiped clean from their 7/12 land extracts. Meanwhile, the distressed district central cooperative banks inability to service customers has added to the slow pace of farmers accessing fresh credit. The Nashik District Central Cooperative Bank (NDCCB) had, by the end of June last year, disbursed over Rs 1,200 crore in crop loans. Once known for its robust financial health, the bank has this year disbursed only Rs 61.41 crore  six per cent of its set target of Rs 1101.05 crore  till now. Chairman Narendra Darade blames the continuing impact of demonetisation for the situation. We do not have cash with us. How are we to disburse money to farmers, he asks.The confusion and consequent glitches in extending fresh credit to farmers eligible for the waiver comes after an already slow crop loan season for Maharashtras banks. By the end of June 2016, of the Rs 37,677.03 crore target for kharif loans, banks had disbursed Rs 20,889.20 crore  a healthy 55 per cent of the target. However, by the middle of June this year, of the targeted Rs 40,547.20 crore, only Rs 9,249.22 crore had been disbursed  barely 23 per cent of the target. On expected lines, district central cooperative banks that disburse around 40 per cent of crop loans have been the worst performers. They have disbursed Rs 5225.94 crore, or 40 per cent of their target of Rs 13108.38 crore. At the end of June 2016, these banks had disbursed Rs 10,451.77 crore of their targeted Rs 13,113.57 crore  80 per cent of the target.Simultaneously, sowing has continued despite the crisis in institutional credit. With healthy water levels in dams and local water bodies, nearly 40 per cent of the kharif sowing is now complete, with over 56 lakh hectares of farm land already sown in anticipation of the promised normal monsoon. At this time last year, only about 13 lakh hectares of farmland had been sown. Villagers say many have turned to private moneylenders in the absence of farm loans from banks. Worse, in some parts of Marathwada, villages actually completed sowing, enthused by the June rainfall, and a dry spell since the end of June has many worried about the likelihood of having to undertake a second sowing, called dubaar perni, a chronic and crippling additional cost for farmers in rainfed and non-irrigated parts.In Dhamangaon village of Ashti taluka, a drought-prone region, for example, a plentiful monsoon in 2016 has ensured theres plenty of water for drinking. But it hasnt rained since the end of June. If it doesnt rain in a week or 10 days, we will have to go in for a second sowing, says deputy sarpanch Dr Syed Bashir. Dhamangaons farmers have sown urad, moong, bajra and cotton and are now concerned about the young crops health at a crucial growth stage.With the weather office predicting a relatively dry July, farmers in Ashti expect they may have to sow a second time. If the promised fresh loans are disbursed now, the money will at least be handy for that, says Dr Syed. If it comes much later, whats the use?Minister of State for Agriculture Sadashiv Khot admitted to receiving complaints about non-disbursal of crop loans from various districts of the state. I will be meeting the chief minister on Friday and ask him to look into the matter. I will also be requesting the district guardian ministers to take weekly meetings with the lead banks and follow up about loan disbursal, he said.

Even as the State got its share of rains, price of the vegetable continues to skyrocket.Sources said, tomato is priced at `70 to `80 a kg in the open market which is almost three times the cost of the vegetable that was being sold at `25 a kg a month ago.The unprecedented price rise has been attributed to supply crunch. While the Capital city requires 100 tonnes of tomato daily, it is now getting half of it. Apart from the locally grown crops, the State depends mostly on Karnataka for the vegetable.According to traders, the red vegetable was priced at `100 a kilo at the Unit-IV market on Thursday. The price, however, came down to `70 on Friday though in some areas it is being sold at `80 a kg.Secretary of Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said the price fluctuation in the market depends on the demand and supply. The supply has been very less from the tomato producing States, he said.Blaming the State Government for the situation, he said, farmers in Keonjhar and Angul region were forced to sell tomatoes at throwaway price during summer. The Government could have purchased the vegetable from the farmers at a reasonable price and stored it for the season. Unfortunately, despite repeated demands, it has failed to set up required number of cold storages, he pointed out.The traders alleged that the retail price is high compared to the wholesale price as the Government has failed to control it. The retail price is 20 to 30 per cent high than the wholesale price, Panda said claiming it should be 5 to 10 per cent depending on the commodity.

5a071f3e9855b76bf13c7dc3,Is inflation falling or steadily rising?,http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2017/jul/24/is-inflation-falling-or-steadily-rising-1632615.html,2017-07-24,,The New Indian Express,"MUMBAI: Retail inflation at 18-year low in June sounds alarming and strengthens the case for rate cuts. But look closely. Inflation isnt falling. Its going up.The misconception is because inflation is widely misread.Its a measure of how much more we pay than last year to achieve the same level of well-being.Inflation is measured every month, but DOES NOT reflect sequential change  the price difference of this month over the previous month  but for say June, 2016 to June, 2017.When the data comes out, its invariably compared with previous month leading to divergent views than that of the RBIs. Retail inflation in May was 2.18 per cent and Junes 1.54 per cent makes you believe its in a free-fall mode.But, if you see month-on-month data, prices are going up. From Januarys 130.3 points, general inflation index in June printed at 132.1 points. Ditto with food inflation, partly explaining why monthly budgets have no respite from falling inflation.Inflation also reflects a change in the base price, not accurate prices. Tomatoes retailed at Rs 3,000 per quintal in Bengaluru both during June 2016 and 2017, but in reality, prices rose, which economists blame on seasonal gyrations. Vegetable prices remain sticky every monsoon. Thats nothing new, says Dr Sowmya Kanti Ghosh, Chief Economic Advisor, SBI Economic Research.Food and fuel account for 57 per cent of the CPI basket, but its direct influence on monetary policy is limited and thats why the RBI seems unperturbed. Low inflation breeds weak economic activity and a rate cut can boost spending and investment, which is why the Ministry of Finance has been pushing hard for cuts.The dominant view is that the RBI is moving too independently, and isnt seeing what everyone else is experiencing. Because inflation is incorrectly compared to previous months data, the clamour for rate cuts is growing, but the Central bank takes a logical view, reasons Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist, Care Ratings.Critics are also pontificating about RBIs error-prone inflation projections, conveniently overlooking the inflation target itself. Strictly speaking, the RBIs Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has to maintain annual inflation of four per cent, with a plus/minus of two per cent. The MPC pegged inflation at 2-3.5 per cent for April-September.It means, Junes 1.54 per cent is well below RBIs lowest band of 2 per cent, but if you take the first quarter (April-June), theres no breach. In fact, the RBI and MPC scored quite a success, smoothly gliding down to the 2-4 target (from 7-8 per cent in 2014) in record time, but holding it here is a challenge.Interestingly, the inflation targeting mechanism was proposed by none other than the RBI Governor Urjit Patel himself. As Deputy Governor in 2014, he chaired the MPC Framework Committee, whose recommendations  including MPC creation and replacing WPI with CPI  were duly adopted in 2015 and 2016.Importantly, three of the Patel Committee members namely Patel himself, Prof Chetan Ghate, and RBI Executive Director M D Patra  are now part of the six-member MPC and to misinterpret and underestimate the collective wisdom is jumping the gun too soon. This isnt to say the MPC is fool-proof. Even with a clear target, suitable instruments and insulation from outside pressures, it cannot possibly foresee all contingencies (demonetisation, GST). Eventually, its decision depends on judgment and discretion.Now the rate cutting part. As eminent cartoonist R K Laxman once poignantly noted, for every ill, the only cure is for the RBI to cut rates. Since January 2015, policy rates are sliced to the bone by 175 bps, yet private investment is poor. How effective will a 25 bps cut next month is anybodys guess. RBI Deputy Governor Viral Acharya, whos plumbing the banks punctured balance sheets, last week made his views clear: cleaning up bad loans as a priority over rates.What does the rest of the MPC think? We will know soon.Inflation challengesIf the MPC fails its inflation target of four per cent (+/- 2 per cent) for three successive quarters, it will have to issue a public statement, signed by each member, stating the reason(s) for failure, remedial actions proposed and the likely period of time over which inflation will return to the centre of the inflation target zone.","mumbai: retail inflation at 18-year low in june sounds alarming and strengthens the case for rate cuts. but look closely. inflation isnt falling. its going up.the misconception is because inflation is widely misread.its a measure of how much more we pay than last year to achieve the same level of well-being.inflation is measured every month, but does not reflect sequential change  the price difference of this month over the previous month  but for say june, 2016 to june, 2017.when the data comes out, its invariably compared with previous month leading to divergent views than that of the rbis. retail inflation in may was 2.18 per cent and junes 1.54 per cent makes you believe its in a free-fall mode.but, if you see month-on-month data, prices are going up. from januarys 130.3 points, general inflation index in june printed at 132.1 points. ditto with food inflation, partly explaining why monthly budgets have no respite from falling inflation.inflation also reflects a change in the base price, not accurate prices. tomatoes retailed at rs 3,000 per quintal in bengaluru both during june 2016 and 2017, but in reality, prices rose, which economists blame on seasonal gyrations. vegetable prices remain sticky every monsoon. thats nothing new, says dr sowmya kanti ghosh, chief economic advisor, sbi economic research.food and fuel account for 57 per cent of the cpi basket, but its direct influence on monetary policy is limited and thats why the rbi seems unperturbed. low inflation breeds weak economic activity and a rate cut can boost spending and investment, which is why the ministry of finance has been pushing hard for cuts.the dominant view is that the rbi is moving too independently, and isnt seeing what everyone else is experiencing. because inflation is incorrectly compared to previous months data, the clamour for rate cuts is growing, but the central bank takes a logical view, reasons madan sabnavis, chief economist, care ratings.critics are also pontificating about rbis error-prone inflation projections, conveniently overlooking the inflation target itself. strictly speaking, the rbis monetary policy committee (mpc) has to maintain annual inflation of four per cent, with a plus/minus of two per cent. the mpc pegged inflation at 2-3.5 per cent for april-september.it means, junes 1.54 per cent is well below rbis lowest band of 2 per cent, but if you take the first quarter (april-june), theres no breach. in fact, the rbi and mpc scored quite a success, smoothly gliding down to the 2-4 target (from 7-8 per cent in 2014) in record time, but holding it here is a challenge.interestingly, the inflation targeting mechanism was proposed by none other than the rbi governor urjit patel himself. as deputy governor in 2014, he chaired the mpc framework committee, whose recommendations  including mpc creation and replacing wpi with cpi  were duly adopted in 2015 and 2016.importantly, three of the patel committee members namely patel himself, prof chetan ghate, and rbi executive director m d patra  are now part of the six-member mpc and to misinterpret and underestimate the collective wisdom is jumping the gun too soon. this isnt to say the mpc is fool-proof. even with a clear target, suitable instruments and insulation from outside pressures, it cannot possibly foresee all contingencies (demonetisation, gst). eventually, its decision depends on judgment and discretion.now the rate cutting part. as eminent cartoonist r k laxman once poignantly noted, for every ill, the only cure is for the rbi to cut rates. since january 2015, policy rates are sliced to the bone by 175 bps, yet private investment is poor. how effective will a 25 bps cut next month is anybodys guess. rbi deputy governor viral acharya, whos plumbing the banks punctured balance sheets, last week made his views clear: cleaning up bad loans as a priority over rates.what does the rest of the mpc think? we will know soon.inflation challengesif the mpc fails its inflation target of four per cent (+/- 2 per cent) for three successive quarters, it will have to issue a public statement, signed by each member, stating the reason(s) for failure, remedial actions proposed and the likely period of time over which inflation will return to the centre of the inflation target zone."

It started in October when Delhi-based queer rights activist Sharma tied up with Chez Jerome, an expert in French and Indian cuisines. The French chef later stepped down and handed the reins of control to Sharma and his Italian partner Roberto.For Sharma running the cafe comes with a responsibility. ""I have to make sure that this cafe is not specifically for gay men because they already have many spaces in the city where they can hang out. They are dominating queer spaces all around the city,"" he said.With a small dance floor under an open sky and seating for around 30 people, the cafe usually opens in the evening. The menu, inspired by French, Greek and Italian cuisines, could compete with any eatery in the city.On offer are a variety of salads, omelettes, pastas as well as thin crust pizzas with traditional toppings and dips. Specialties of the house include Greek chicken potato salad, a delicate mix of potatoes, onions, tomatoes and chicken salami, Parisian salad dressed with fresh lettuce and fresh parmesan and freshly baked breads.But it's not all about food.

The ruling side hit back, saying the present miserable condition of the farmers was due to the Congress partys rule of 60 years.The BJP members said it was the Modi government which had initiated a slew of programmes for the welfare of farmers over the last three years.Initiating the discussion on the farmers distress leading to rise in the incidents of thier suicide, Digvijay Singh (Cong) accused the government of being insensitive to plight of the agriculturists.He referred to the police firing on a violent agitation by farmers in Madhya Pradesh recently and said the agriculturists faced bullets on the centenary of Champaran agitation in which Mahatma Gandhi had raised his voice against British exploitation.He termed the imposition of import-export duties on foodgrains as one of the biggest scams.He said despite the bumper crop, import duty on wheat was reduced initially to 10 per cent from 25 per cent and then to zero in December, impacting farmers adversely as imported wheat was avaiable at cheaper prices.Foodgrain imports, which stood at Rs 134 crore in 2014-15, have risen to Rs 9,009 crore now, he said.Singh alleged that it was the wrong import-export policies which had led to imports of Rs 1,40,268 crore in 2015-16 as against Rs 56,000 crore in 2011-12.Quoting agriculture scientist MS Swaminathan to say that import of agricultural commodities was like outsourcing farmers skill to outside, he said there was a need for fixing import-export levies by the Commerce Ministry in consultation with Agriculture Ministry.Expressing concern over 42 per cent rise in incidents of suicide in 2014-15 in the country, Singh said agriculture has been reduced to loss-making proposition despite it contributing about 17 per cent to the GDP.He also alleged that there was corruption in Food Corporation of India (FCI) and National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED).The Congress leader alleged that after demonetisation, it was restrictions on cattle sale that had hit the farmers.He quoted Savarkar as saying that he was against ban on cow slaughter.Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Singh said that others in the Cabinet were helpless as it was PM who decided everything.He alleged that the crop insurance policy was nothing but a way to benefit industrialists.Minister of State for Agriculture Parshottam Rupala, who spoke in the capacity of a BJP member, said it was the Congress partys rule of 60 years which had resulted in the miserable condition of the farmers.There should be a discussion on the policies of previous governments and what all they did for farm sector, he said.He said the Modi government had taken a number of steps for the betterment of the farmers.Listing out the schemes, he said Rs 50,000 crore has been allocated for PM Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY) and 22 schemes under the project have already seen the light of the day.Under the programme, plans for irrigation at district level have been formulated, Rupala said.Ram Gopal Yadav of Samajwadi Party said the farmers have been affected because of import of agri products, which he alleged was being allowed because of ulterior motives while farmers are being deprived of remunerative prices.The prices of many agri-items have fallen below the minium support prices and, in some crops, it is not enough to meet even the transportation cost, he said.Citing the example of tomato prices that have risen sharply to about Rs 100 per kg, he said the prices are low when crops are harvested, but these rise after farmers sell their produce in the market.He said the futures market was also responsible for the farmers plight.Yadav said the agri growth has largely been below 4 per cent in last 25-30 years and that the farmers economic condition would not improve unless there is a sustainable growth in the sector.Yadav said the government has put tractors and pump sets in higher tax rate under the new GST regime and demanded that these items should be exempted from GST.Food processing in the country is in such a bad shape that every year fruits and vegetables worth Rs 50,000 crore to Rs 60,000 crore rot in the country, he said.Food processing percentage in India is barely 4 per cent as compared to 80 per cent in nations like Brazil, he added.He wanted to know under what circumstances private companies were roped in crop insurance scheme which was handled by the government companies earlier.He also wondered as to why the government could not use technology so that Indian apples could also last more unlike those imported from the US.Prasanna Acharya (BJD) sought to know from the government why farmers are committing suicide and are protesting on streets if the agriculture growth was high.He said farmers are not getting returns for their produce and are being cheated, not by Monsoon but by the government. Demonetisation has further aggravated their woes, he added.While the new crop insurance policy is better than the previous ones, it is benefitting private insurers more, he said.He said the Centre and states should take steps to fulfill three main demands of farmers  price, pension and prestige.Munquad Ali (BSP) said farmers situation is very bad in the country and that there has been a rise in farmers suicides in the last three years.Why it is happening? Why the government is not finding solution farmers problems? .I request the government not to give false promises. Please work for the welfare of farmers, he said.Praful Patel of NCP pitched for modern farm technologies like genetically modified crops to boost farm income,.It is unfortunate.

We need to take benefit of it, he said.Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh has always focused on indigenous (technologies) but there is a need to use modern technology to improve farmers income, he said and suggested the minister to keep open mind on the issue of technology.Patel also spoke about shortcomings in the new crop insurance scheme and suggested the government to keep a watch on private insurers who are implementing it.Vijaysai Reddy (YSRCP) said the government needs to introspect why 12,000 farmers are committing suicides every year despite the government coming out with new schemes.He demanded that the loan waiver announced in some states need to be implemented in letter and spirite, claims under new crop insurance scheme should be settled in 15 days, better credit facility and creation of special agri-zones for farmers for better realisation.R S Bharathi (DMK) attacked the Prime Minister for not meeting the protesting Tamil Nadu farmers in Delhi and demanded a special session of Parliament to discuss the farmers issue and a special law to address their woes.Rajani Patil (Cong) said, I dont think the number (of farmers suicides will come down if the government does not take steps.She attacked Modi for not visiting affected farmers in Maharashtra, saying the prime minister has time to travel around the globe but no time for farmers in the state.Turning to Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh, she said the farmers situation is very serious. We dont want to hear about schemes in your reply. Tell me what relief you can give to our farmers. We want full loan waiver.Prabhat Jha (BJP) rejected allegation that the government was insensitive towards farmers plight and said maximum decisions had been taken over the last three years in the interest of farmers.He listed a slew of measures underaken like raising minimum support price for agriculture produce like wheat, rice, pulses and oilseeds.He said it was due to initiatives of the government that there was a record production of foodgrains in the country in 2016-17 at 271.98 million tonne (MT) including 108.8 MT rice and 96.64 MT of wheat besides 22.14 MT of pulses and 33.60 MT of oilseeds.On police firing during farmers agitation in Madhya Pradesh recently, Jha asked the opposition not to link such incidents to politics.He reminded the Congress that 24 farmers had been killed in firing in Madhya Pradesh in 1998 when Digvijay Singh was the Chief Minister and said nobody linked it to politics.D Raja of CPI said the whole country is witnessing suffering of farmers and asked the central government to consider debt waiver which has been done by various states.Farmers committing suicides should be unacceptable to us, Raja said and questioned why various commission reports on agriculture were not being implemented by the government.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App","senior congress leader digvijaya singh.

According to an official, traders from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are purchasing the product in Karnataka.In May, tomato cultivators in Kolar were dumping their crop by the roadside as prices had crashed to as low as Rs. 2 a kg in the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) yard. This month, however, the tide has turned. Rates have doubled and, in some cases, increased four times since June. Kolar district is one of the biggest producers of tomato in Karnataka.The reason for this change in narrative is a massive loss of the crop in some of the major tomato growing States in the country.Huge damage to crops, particularly in Nashik in Maharashtra, is the main reason for increase in demand from Kolar. Plus, damage to crop due to diseases and pests in non-traditional areas such as Mandya has added to the scarcity, said M.S. Raju, Deputy Director, Horticulture Department.According to A. Vishwanath, an APMC official, traders from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are purchasing the product in Karnataka. Another APMC source said that there has been interest even from Punjab. On June 4, a quintal was being sold at the APMC for a minimum of Rs. 314 and a maximum of Rs. 1,400 depending on quality and variety. On July 4, the price range was from Rs. 667 to Rs. 5,334 a quintal. On Wednesday morning, the average rate was around Rs. 5,000.In the retail market, consumers were paying Rs. 10 per kg a month ago. Now, they have to shell out as much as Rs. 50.Search for alternativesA reduction in supply from other States and districts combined with the produce from Kolar being shipped out of Karnataka has led to a scarcity and a steep hike in prices in the local market.This has led to experimenting with other local products.

Retail price of tomatoes has risen sharply across 17 major cities and breached the Rs 90 per kg mark. There are signs that household budgets are going to be under more stress as wholesale price of onions at Lasalgaon, Maharashtra, last week hit a 19-month high at Rs 1,300 a quintal. The price of these two items serves as a barometer and recent trends are worrisome.Price spikes are not uncommon. What makes the current situation unusual is that it comes at a time of normal monsoon and soon after farmers were gutted on account of a post-demonetisation collapse in prices. A cycle where farmers and consumers are stressed by turn is a sign of fundamental problems. At the same time a birds eye view shows that fruits and vegetables are where farmers are putting more effort on the heels of changing consumption patterns. Consequently, despite two of the last four years having deficient rainfall, production has risen steadily. Even area under cultivation increased and reached 24.92 million hectares last year.Despite positive trends, if neither farmers nor consumers are satisfied, it is on account of factors under the control of policy makers and some beyond them. Sharp swings in climatic patterns have increased in the recent past, which makes agriculture a riskier proposition. Centre and states worsen this situation with an uncertain policy environment. The cumulative impact is that farmers get garbled price signals, which leads to oscillation between glut and shortage. Fixing this problem has to start with governments letting price become the primary signal for sowing, then keeping the economic environment stable for farmers.A stable environment has to be complemented with two other steps. A start has been made by linking 455 markets of 13 states through an online marketplace, with more states expected to follow. This is an important step in breaking the hold of wholesale cartels. But it needs follow up in the form of superior infrastructure. Harvest and post-harvest losses in vegetables are estimated to be upto 12.44% of production. India needs to urgently enhance its cold storage infrastructure by providing private sector with better investment incentives.

According to retailers, this is perhaps the first time that tomato prices have crossed the Rs. 100 mark, according to retailers. The higher quality tomatoes from Bangalore cost a bit more at Rs. 120 a kg in Mumbai, they said.Every monsoon, prices would go up to around Rs. 80 due to shortage, but this time it is worse. There is an acute shortage in the market, Harishchandra Gupta, a vegetable vendor in the western suburbs, said.Sources said the sudden shortage in tomatoes is a direct fallout of the state-wide protest by farmers last month. They said rampaging mobs of farmers demanding loan waivers had destroyed truckloads of tomatoes across the State. This, sources said, had forced a large number of marginal tomato farmers to destroy their standing crop as they feared the protest could continue.Small farmers were scared. The off-take from their fields had stopped. Fearing more loss, they preferred to uproot the standing crop much before the harvest and plant other crops. This has lead to a supply problem, which is expected to continue till August, a tomato trader said.In just two days, prices have gone up from Rs. 80 per kg to Rs. 100 per kg.

Surprisingly, prices at the comparatively upmarket Godrej Natures Basket was lower at Rs. 67 per kg. Analysts said this is because such stores have long term supply contracts with growers.Tomato prices touched Rs. 80 in Mira-Bhayandar and Vasai-Virar, evoking strong reactions from homemakers.

(Above and three-column image below) Pictures show the Sardar wholesale agricultural market, in Surat, Gujarat.R.V. MoorthyR_V_MoorthyIt is past noon and the Sardar wholesale agricultural market in Surat is bustling with activity. Trucks drive in every minute and so do lorries smaller in size. Farmers arrive in these with loads of agricultural produce to sell. The place has multiple rows of platforms interspersed with streets and parking spots. Each platform is dedicated to different kinds of produce: onion, fruits, vegetables, etc. Things move with clockwork precision. Daily-wage labourers offload the sacks of farm produce from trucks, dumping them in huge heaps on the floor of the platforms. A different set of merchants buys this grain and transports it from here, to be sold in towns nearby. The merchants registered here who act as conduits for the sale take a 6% commission on the produce sold. The rest goes to the farmer, and is delivered in cash on the second or fourth day.This correspondent  who accompanied the ongoing yatra of farmers organisations from Madhya Pradesh to Delhi through parts of Maharashtra and Gujarat  took a detour to talk to people at this wholesale market to make sense of agricultural marketing operations.Ebb and flow of pricesThe place is a market seeing daily fluctuations of prices, based on demand and supply. If a greater quantity of a crop comes to the market on a given day and fewer merchants land up to buy it, the price falls. If more merchants come and there is dearth of a commodity, the price rises. Farmers benefit from a higher price and return disappointed if the prices are low. The prices fluctuate even within a day. To sell for a good price is like being lucky in a draw of lots.Rakesh Bhambre and Sunil Sonone, who have driven down in a rented truck from Daswel village of the Baglan taluka in Nashik district of Maharashtra, have had a hectic day. They arrived here at 2 a.m. Through the morning, they have sold their onions, which were harvested in April, and have managed to get a price of Rs. 6-7 per kg, which is not bad. They will now head back to their village in a bit. The merchant will send them the money for their produce in cash two days from now, which another truck coming from their village will deliver to them.The two Nashik farmers say they engage only in farming and have no side work to do. Their annual calendar is hectic. In June/July and October, they sow sugar cane, which requires a lot of water and takes close to nine months to be ready. This year isnt a good one for sugar cane, they fear, as it isnt raining yet. They sow onion in August and also in November. They have brought the harvest of their November crop of onion here, they say. The advantage with onion is that it can also be stored for four-five months.They also sow tomato in June and July, and the crop takes two months to be ready.The agricultural process requires a variety of expenses. They need to buy seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and machines on hire for harvesting. They have to pay the bills for power consumed while watering their fields. They also need to hire labour for various operations, from preparing the fields, taking care of the crop to loading the produce on to trucks. Labour charges range from Rs. 70-100 a day.These expenses  varying for different crops  are facilitated both by the money they get by selling their previous produce in the market and by borrowing from cooperative banks, nationalised banks and regional rural banks at an interest of around 7%. Sometimes, they have to borrow from private merchants too, at a higher rate of interest on a monthly basis. Most farmers are under debt of a few lakhs, and sometimes borrow from one lender to pay another. A good crop and remunerative prices  a matter of chance  can lead to better incomes. A slump in prices of a crop or erratic monsoon can lead to loss.The variegated world of farmersThis year, farmers in Nimaad region of Madhya Pradesh and in adjoining parts of Maharashtra  like Nashik and Ahmednagar  are still awaiting rains. If it does not rain for another week, they say, their crops will be damaged. Villages, of course, have farmers of varying means. The richer ones have more land  perhaps 20 acres  and can try three or four kinds of crops in their fields. If one fails, they believe the other will not. The smaller farmers find it harder to get by.The truck in which Bhambre and Sonone brought their produce to Surat has been hired from a bigger farmer of their village, who owns trucks and hires them out.These two farmers  each owning 7-8 acres of land  however spend the year in farming, both with their family labour and hired daily wagers. The poorest in villages own no land of their own, and work on the fields of others.The wealthier farmers have also diversified into related occupations and other businesses as an additional cushion, as farming is not very lucrative and yields and prices are unpredictable. The poorest in the agricultural world either work others fields or do additional work as rickshaw pullers, construction workers, etc., sometimes becoming poor migrants. Hours before reaching the Surat market, this correspondent visited Koribhartna village near Surat, where daily wagers were working the fields of a richer farmer where okra was being grown. Dinesh, a daily-wage labourer of the village with no land of his own, said he works through the year at a daily wage of Rs. 100. He gets one or the other agricultural work through the year, he says, but adds that the money he earns is not enough for maintaining his family well.Pandane village in Nashik district is situated close to a dam from where it gets what villagers complain is sand-laced water. Pradip Shivaji Chitte, whose joint family has 7.5-acres of land, of which he works on just 2.5, has opened a small shop dealing in seeds, fertilisers and pesticides. He rented this shop two months ago in a bid to diversify beyond farming. I invested Rs. 1 lakh in this; some of my friends also contributed, he says. But till now, I am just being able to break even. Chitte says he is under Rs. 16-lakh debt and practises grape farming in the village. In our village, half the farming is grape farming; the rest is of all other crops, he says.Just preparing the fields for the crops entails a labour charge of Rs. 20,000 per acre, he claims. The fields are prepared from September and the harvest comes only by January, before which the crop requires a lot of care. The total expense, including labour, fertilisers and pesticides, comes to Rs. 1.6-1.7 lakh per acre. The selling of the produce begins from January and it sells at about Rs. 18-25 per kg. If one subtracts the expense borne from the selling price per acre, the profit is Rs. 45,000-50,000. This is the annual income for growing grapes per acre. Chitte says bigger farmers aiming at exports prepare their fields a month earlier  they also get higher prices when they sell their produce, he adds.Farmers in the Nimaad region of Madhya Pradesh also grow hybrid crops like Bt cotton.The same is the case in neighbouring districts of Maharashtra like Nashik. Jagdish Patidar, who came to Barwani for a day from Maheshwar in Madhya Pradesh to take part in the ongoing rally of farmers organisations, says he too grows Bt cotton, which requires more supply of water and higher input costs. What they look for is higher prices for their produce.Bt cotton costs more but is high yield and therefore more lucrative for farmers. When a new variety that is advertised as high yield comes, farmers will take to it for profits, says Lakhwinder Singh, an agriculture expert at Punjabi University, Patiala. Many farmers also took to it as it was advertised as resistant to bollworm, a pest that affected cotton. However, Singh cautions, the pest resistance is only for three-four years.Agitations and farmers yatraThe ongoing farmers agitations are demanding state support for making farming more lucrative. They demand that the M.S. Swaminathan Committees recommendation  that the government-announced minimum support price (MSP) should be 1.5-times the cost of production  be implemented. They are also demanding farm loan waiver, as many farmers are under large debt. However, a loan waiver does not ease the burden of loans taken from private parties.Till July 14, a Kisan Mukti Yatra involving several farmers organisations has been moving through Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, addressing villagers and articulating these demands. The participants argue that while input costs for farming have been rising, the rise in MSP has been sluggish.Swaraj Abhiyan leader and academic Yogendra Yadav, Narmada Bachao Andolan leader Medha Patkar, Maharashtra farmer leader Raju Shetti, the All India Kisan Sabha, Kisan Sangharsh Morcha, Bhartiya Kisan Union of Punjab, and other organisations are taking part in the yatra, which will converge on Jantar Mantar in Delhi on July 18. It began in Madhya Pradesh, with the farmers leaders being detained for a few hours by the police, and passed through Indore, Barwani  visiting village Barda, which is in the submergence zone of the Sardar Sarovar dam  Nashik, Vyara and Surat in Gujarat, Bhilwara and Jaipur in Rajasthan, among other places. There are regular halts to interact with people, with crowds varying from a few hundred to a few thousand turning up.The yatra comes close on the heels of the deaths of six farmers in police action in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, and a strike by Maharashtra farmers early in June, when they decided to let their farm produce and milk perish but not sell it in the absence of lucrative prices. The strike was broken in 48 hours after talks with the Maharashtra government, which made a few announcements: loan waivers for small and debt-ridden farmers; a Bill to criminalise buying produce at rates below the MSP; the setting up of a State Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices on the lines of the Centre to look into MSP issues. The State government also offered to subsidise farmers power bills, hike milk prices and set up cold storage chains for preserving the produce.Making farming sustainableThe journey shows one thing  that farming, which sustains more than half of Indias population even if many of them also do other things on the side for supplementary income, is not a lucrative proposition. Farmlands have become smaller over generations and, except for large farmers, many do not find it rewarding but find themselves ill-trained for other occupations, says Patidar, the farmer from Maheshwar. Farmers, however, do have an emotional attachment to farming.Their fortunes depend on many things: rains, prevailing prices, and how indebted they become. Lakhwinder Singh says that the answer to the agrarian unease is either subsidies on input costs or higher prices. He says farmers need to spend not just on farming but also on services like education and health. Unless their expenses go down or incomes go up, discontent is expected, he adds. Everything from health and education to seeds that were public services once are private services now. Farmers get into this loop of rising costs of living, he explains.In Punjab, the government purchases all wheat and rice crops at the MSP. This, being scientifically calculated, can enable farmers to have some incomes that make agriculture meaningful. But the same procurement guarantee applies neither to all crops nor to all States, which makes farming less lucrative as an occupation, says Lakhwinder Singh.Farmers in Madhya Pradesh say that government procurement centres are opened late, often a month and a half after a crop is ready. But farmers cannot store it all in their fields near their homes. They try to sell their crop soon after harvest to merchants, and often get prices below the MSP. If government centres were to start as soon as the harvest came, we would get better prices, says Patidar.The troubles dont end here. Patidar says not all the produce is bought by these centres; it may be rejected on grounds of quality. Suraj, a young farmer from Naraula village in Barwani district, says that there is much paperwork in these centres to ascertain the quantity of land on which the crop was sown, the yield, and to verify that the produce indeed belongs to the farmer who brought it.Unless there is a procurement guarantee and the farmer can count on the government to purchase his produce, the MSP has little meaning on the ground, says former Maharashtra State Planning Commission member and economist H.M. Desarda. Lakhwinder Singh adds that if the government undertakes to purchase all major crops at the MSP, farmers will be better off.But will this not push prices of farm produce bought by consumers upward? Lakhwinder Singh disagrees. He says the large number of middlemen in the supply chain do not anyway let vegetable and grain prices reflect the prices at which farmers are selling them. The long-term answer to farmers indebtedness, he adds, is a rise in their incomes.It may become a heated debate politically, but an answer to non-remunerative farming may take longer to come.Unless there is a procurement guarantee and the farmer can count on the government to purchase his produce, the MSP has little meaning on the ground,H.M. DesardaFormer Maharashtra State Planning Commission member and economist","under the onion skin:the journey shows one thing  that farming, which sustains more than half of indias population even if many of them also do other things on the side for supplementary income, is not a lucrative proposition. (above and three-column image below) pictures show the sardar wholesale agricultural market, in surat, gujarat.r.v. moorthyr_v_moorthyit is past noon and the sardar wholesale agricultural market in surat is bustling with activity. trucks drive in every minute and so do lorries smaller in size. farmers arrive in these with loads of agricultural produce to sell. the place has multiple rows of platforms interspersed with streets and parking spots. each platform is dedicated to different kinds of produce: onion, fruits, vegetables, etc. things move with clockwork precision. daily-wage labourers offload the sacks of farm produce from trucks, dumping them in huge heaps on the floor of the platforms. a different set of merchants buys this grain and transports it from here, to be sold in towns nearby. the merchants registered here who act as conduits for the sale take a 6% commission on the produce sold. the rest goes to the farmer, and is delivered in cash on the second or fourth day.this correspondent  who accompanied the ongoing yatra of farmers organisations from madhya pradesh to delhi through parts of maharashtra and gujarat  took a detour to talk to people at this wholesale market to make sense of agricultural marketing operations.ebb and flow of pricesthe place is a market seeing daily fluctuations of prices, based on demand and supply. if a greater quantity of a crop comes to the market on a given day and fewer merchants land up to buy it, the price falls. if more merchants come and there is dearth of a commodity, the price rises. farmers benefit from a higher price and return disappointed if the prices are low. the prices fluctuate even within a day. to sell for a good price is like being lucky in a draw of lots.rakesh bhambre and sunil sonone, who have driven down in a rented truck from daswel village of the baglan taluka in nashik district of maharashtra, have had a hectic day. they arrived here at 2 a.m. through the morning, they have sold their onions, which were harvested in april, and have managed to get a price of rs. 6-7 per kg, which is not bad. they will now head back to their village in a bit. the merchant will send them the money for their produce in cash two days from now, which another truck coming from their village will deliver to them.the two nashik farmers say they engage only in farming and have no side work to do. their annual calendar is hectic. in june/july and october, they sow sugar cane, which requires a lot of water and takes close to nine months to be ready. this year isnt a good one for sugar cane,

Today, thanks to less production and greater demand, the average rate is Rs 80 a kilo and even an unprecedented Rs 100 is not unheard of.""While there are tomato varieties of lower quality which cost around Rs 80 in the local markets, the best ones are being sold even at Rs 110 per kg,"" says S Siraj Ahmed, a vegetable merchant in Russell Market.The reasons for the spike in prices are not hard to find at the Agricultural Produce and Marketing Committee (APMC) premises at Kolar headquarters, Asia's second largest tomato market. Traders and APMC officials at the yard and farmers in the surrounding villages agree that a combination of a dip in tomato production this season and a sudden rise in the demand for Kolar tomatoes from other states has led to rocketing prices.Kolar APMC secretary T S Ravi Kumar said tomato production in the region had gradually gone down in the past few months due to various reasons  less rain, low pricing and increased temperatures which decreases the yield. ""The supply we receive at the APMC during this season has gone down by 50% compared with last year. At this juncture, the demand for stocks has also gone up from some of the north Indian states where the production has come to a standstill due to flooding and other reasons.

The skies open up and he pulls a plastic sheet over his head, wondering if he will be working at a petrol pump by this time next year. This isn't a story of urbanisation but of a murder convict being given a shot at reintegration into society.Harilal (name changed) is among a bunch of 24 convicts who have been farming at Thane's open prison . If a proposal made by the prison authorities is accepted by the state government, eight of them could be working as attendants at a petrol pump and car washing centre to be set up in the open prison premises. Prison authorities have written to government-owned oil companies for information about requirements for setting up fuel dispensing units. The open prison at Thane, spread across 20 acres, began operating three years ago. It is the only open prison in Mumbai metropolitan region where convicts can work with no boundary walls. The selection process and eligibility criteria are carefully laid down to choose only the best cases fit for transfer to an open prison. For instance, a committee looks at a con vict's behaviour inside the prison and whether at least a third of his sentence has be en completed. For every ye ar spent in the open prison, the convict get a remission of 13 months in his sentence. But if he is caught fleeing, he would be sent back to the prison and lose his privileges.At Thane's open prison, the largely grey-haired bunch of convicts cultivate land under the watchful eye of an instructor and prison guards.The produce is sold to other prisons. Between April 2016 and March 2017, the Thane facility earned a revenue of Rs 13.4 lakh from the sale of farm produce. ""The group of convicts is involved in every stage of production--from sowing to reaping. We have a tractor and 18 cattle. All kinds of vegetables are grown: tomatoes, brinjals, lady's finger and leafy vegetables like spinach. But during monsoon, we only grow rice,"" the instructor told TOI. After the day's work is over, the convicts return to their barracks within the prison.There are some patches of land that are not under cultivation. It is on one such patch that the authorities plan to instal two fuel units and operate a petrol pump. ""Motorists riding on the stretch from Thane central jail to Rabodi could re fuel their vehicles here. The cash collection will be handled by prison guards. Two convicts would operate a fuel-dispensing unit each and six others would work at an adjacent car wash centre--if things go as per plan,"" said Nitin Vayachal, superintendent, Thane prison. This would be the first time the convicts would interact with the public while still in incarceration; so far their interaction was limited to jail staff.""Open prisons are a good innovation to decongest prisons and facilitate rehabilitation process while the prisoner is still serving a sentence.A step further is open colonies where the prisoner stays in quarters with his family , goes out to farm and sells the produce on his own. He has to be back by a particular time, else it would be regarded as an escape.Prisons in Sangli, Jaipur, etc, have open colonies,"" said Dr Vijay Raghavan, professor, Centre for Criminology and Justice, TISS. Open prisons are only available for prisoners who have been awarded a life sentence or a very long term. ""As to whether society would accept a convict working in their midst, it would depend on the nature of offence committed.Where a murder was a result of circumstances such as land dispute or family dispute and the convict admits he did it in the heat of the moment, it won't attract the same stigma as a case of rape would,"" added Dr Raghavan.The main objective of the penal system being reformation, it is praiseworthy that Thane prison has a plan to ease the shift for convicts after a life of incarceration. The big challenge of the justice system is to prevent an individual from sliding back into a life of crime after a jail term. Criminal recidivism is as high as 60% even in developed countries.Teaching new skills is one way to stem the tide.","mumbai: harilal bends double to clear a patch of weed before he can start sowing. the skies open up and he pulls a plastic sheet over his head, wondering if he will be working at a petrol pump by this time next year. this isn't a story of urbanisation but of a murder convict being given a shot at reintegration into society.harilal (name changed) is among a bunch of 24 convicts who have been farming at thane's open prison . if a proposal made by the prison authorities is accepted by the state government, eight of them could be working as attendants at a petrol pump and car washing centre to be set up in the open prison premises. prison authorities have written to government-owned oil companies for information about requirements for setting up fuel dispensing units. the open prison at thane, spread across 20 acres, began operating three years ago. it is the only open prison in mumbai metropolitan region where convicts can work with no boundary walls. the selection process and eligibility criteria are carefully laid down to choose only the best cases fit for transfer to an open prison. for instance, a committee looks at a con vict's behaviour inside the prison and whether at least a third of his sentence has be en completed. for every ye ar spent in the open prison, the convict get a remission of 13 months in his sentence. but if he is caught fleeing, he would be sent back to the prison and lose his privileges.at thane's open prison, the largely grey-haired bunch of convicts cultivate land under the watchful eye of an instructor and prison guards.the produce is sold to other prisons. between april 2016 and march 2017, the thane facility earned a revenue of rs 13.4 lakh from the sale of farm produce. ""the group of convicts is involved in every stage of production--from sowing to reaping. we have a tractor and 18 cattle. all kinds of vegetables are grown: tomatoes, brinjals, lady's finger and leafy vegetables like spinach. but during monsoon, we only grow rice,"" the instructor told toi. after the day's work is over, the convicts return to their barracks within the prison.there are some patches of land that are not under cultivation. it is on one such patch that the authorities plan to instal two fuel units and operate a petrol pump. ""motorists riding on the stretch from thane central jail to rabodi could re fuel their vehicles here. the cash collection will be handled by prison guards. two convicts would operate a fuel-dispensing unit each and six others would work at an adjacent car wash centre--if things go as per plan,"" said nitin vayachal, superintendent, thane prison. this would be the first time the convicts would interact with the public while still in incarceration; so far their interaction was limited to jail staff.""open prisons are a good innovation to decongest prisons and facilitate rehabilitation process while the prisoner is still serving a sentence.a step further is open colonies where the prisoner stays in quarters with his family , goes out to farm and sells the produce on his own. he has to be back by a particular time, else it would be regarded as an escape.prisons in sangli, jaipur, etc, have open colonies,"" said dr vijay raghavan, professor, centre for criminology and justice, tiss. open prisons are only available for prisoners who have been awarded a life sentence or a very long term. ""as to whether society would accept a convict working in their midst, it would depend on the nature of offence committed.where a murder was a result of circumstances such as land dispute or family dispute and the convict admits he did it in the heat of the moment, it won't attract the same stigma as a case of rape would,"" added dr raghavan.the main objective of the penal system being reformation, it is praiseworthy that thane prison has a plan to ease the shift for convicts after a life of incarceration. the big challenge of the justice system is to prevent an individual from sliding back into a life of crime after a jail term. criminal recidivism is as high as 60% even in developed countries.teaching new skills is one way to stem the tide."

With onions selling at `40 per kg, the consumers are now feeling the pinch after prices of different vegetables soared between `40 and `100 per kg.In such a scenario, officials of the Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare (FS&CW) department have once again linked the price rise to the problem of limited supply at the source point in Nashik in Maharashtra. There are no reports of hoarding of onions by local wholesalers. We are monitoring the situation. If needed, onions will be sold through Government fair price shops, Sundargarh Civil Supplies Officer (CSO) A Barik said.

The current price spiral is remarkable for its suddenness.First, it was tomatoes and now it is onions, whose prices are soaring, much to the discomfort of consumers and policymakers. The current price spiral is remarkable for its suddenness. Only two months ago  that too, during peak summer  tomatoes were retailing at an all-India average of Rs 15 per kg. That rate has quadrupled since, even scaling Rs 100 briefly in some places. Even more striking is that onion, till as late as July 21, was selling below Rs 7 per kg at Lasalgaon in Maharashtra. But today it is quoting at over twice that level in the countrys biggest market for the bulb. The second point to note about the price flare-up now is that it follows a protracted period of low rates for producers. Leaving out the last 10 days or so, onions have been trading in Lasalgaon at below Rs 10/kg since February 2016. Tomato growers were similarly battling Rs 5-6/kg prices from November right through mid-June; they have hardly benefitted from present wholesale prices of Rs 40-plus.There are two reasons for prices going up. The first is the monsoon. Rainfall this time, although normal on the whole, hasnt been as good and well-distributed as in 2016. While Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and even the Marathwada and Vidarbha regions of Maharashtra are facing drought-like conditions, Gujarat and Rajasthan have borne the fury of floods. This has led to delayed plantings or even necessitated re-sowing of the kharif crop in many areas. The immediate impact is being felt in onions and tomatoes, but the effects on other crops  maize, jowar, groundnut, soyabean, cotton  cannot be ruled out. The second explanation may have to do with un-remunerative realisations, post-demonetisation, in most crops until recently. There is evidence, at least in tomatoes, of farmers cutting back on production as a result. The price of that is now being paid by consumers.Going by past record, the Centres most likely response to rising prices would be to impose restrictions on exports (not allowing shipments below a minimum price) and holding of stocks by traders/processors, alongside allowing duty-free imports or even contracting these through government agencies. We saw this in 2014, 2015 and even 2016 in respect of onions, potatoes, pulses and sugar. While being sensitive to the interests of consumers may be a good thing  and also in consonance with the Reserve Bank of Indias inflation-targeting goals  this clearly cannot be at the expense of producers. Like its predecessors, the Narendra Modi government has shown little commitment to the principles of free trade and liberalisation when it comes to agriculture.

5a0df42e9855b76bf13d2bde,Kolkata style rolls now in Hyderabad,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2017/aug/04/kolkata-style-rolls-now-in-hyderabad-1638504.html,2017-08-04,,The New Indian Express,"HYDERABAD: Every place has its favourite set of street foods, like the stuffed paratha from Delhi or Vada Pav from Mumbai. Kolkata is known for its trademark roll, a sumptuous snack where chicken or mutton pieces sauted with onions and masala are rolled inside a layered and flaky paratha, and served wrapped in thin paper. The snack was conceived by a small restaurant named Nizams near Hogg Market, Kolkata about eighty years ago, arguably as food to be consumed on the go.Initially it was known as kathi roll, because kebabs inside the rolls were charcoal grilled on wooden sticks or kathi. However, over the decades, as the snack became increasingly popular and roll centres mushroomed all over the city, partially cooked meat finished on a tawa started mostly being used instead of kebabs. A large variety of rolls have evolved in the last couple of decades with eggs added to the paratha, and a vegetarian version using potato or paneer as stuffing. The trend of using tomato or chilli sauces in the filling have also become common, much to the dismay of a puritan like me. One of the reasons of popularity of this street food is that it can serve as a utility lunch, evening snack or dinner. You can customise your roll by adding more layers to it, starting from a simple chicken roll and scaling up to the double egg double chicken version.It is fascinating to see a Kolkata style roll being prepared right in front of you. Freshly rolled out layered and flaky paratha is fried in oil on a tawa. For an egg roll, egg is added on the paratha while frying. The filling is prepared separately with meat, onion, optionally veggies like capsicum or cucumber, and a masala  for the last one many shops have their own proprietary versions. Then the paratha is deftly rolled with this filling, and sauces, lime, chopped chillies and dry masala added as per customer specification.In Hyderabad, the Kolkata style rolls have been popularised by Roll Call, that started as a kiosk selling rolls in Madhapur from 2002. They now have roll centres all over the city. Jayeeta Majumdar Singhee, one of the partners at Roll Call mentioned that apart from the authentic rolls from Kolkata, they have also introduced spicy versions like Chicken and Paneer 65 rolls for the local Hyderabadi palate. Overall, they have around 30 variants of rolls with versions like cheese rolls, seekh kebab rolls and reshmi kebab rolls and the rolls are also easy on the pockets priced at `50-100 range. Roll Durbar in Gachibowli, Amantran in Domalguda and Kolkata House in Kondapur are some other places to enjoy Kolkata style rolls.","hyderabad: every place has its favourite set of street foods, like the stuffed paratha from delhi or vada pav from mumbai. kolkata is known for its trademark roll, a sumptuous snack where chicken or mutton pieces sauted with onions and masala are rolled inside a layered and flaky paratha, and served wrapped in thin paper. the snack was conceived by a small restaurant named nizams near hogg market, kolkata about eighty years ago, arguably as food to be consumed on the go.initially it was known as kathi roll, because kebabs inside the rolls were charcoal grilled on wooden sticks or kathi. however, over the decades, as the snack became increasingly popular and roll centres mushroomed all over the city, partially cooked meat finished on a tawa started mostly being used instead of kebabs. a large variety of rolls have evolved in the last couple of decades with eggs added to the paratha, and a vegetarian version using potato or paneer as stuffing. the trend of using tomato or chilli sauces in the filling have also become common, much to the dismay of a puritan like me. one of the reasons of popularity of this street food is that it can serve as a utility lunch, evening snack or dinner. you can customise your roll by adding more layers to it, starting from a simple chicken roll and scaling up to the double egg double chicken version.it is fascinating to see a kolkata style roll being prepared right in front of you. freshly rolled out layered and flaky paratha is fried in oil on a tawa. for an egg roll, egg is added on the paratha while frying. the filling is prepared separately with meat, onion, optionally veggies like capsicum or cucumber, and a masala  for the last one many shops have their own proprietary versions. then the paratha is deftly rolled with this filling, and sauces, lime, chopped chillies and dry masala added as per customer specification.in hyderabad, the kolkata style rolls have been popularised by roll call, that started as a kiosk selling rolls in madhapur from 2002. they now have roll centres all over the city. jayeeta majumdar singhee, one of the partners at roll call mentioned that apart from the authentic rolls from kolkata, they have also introduced spicy versions like chicken and paneer 65 rolls for the local hyderabadi palate. overall, they have around 30 variants of rolls with versions like cheese rolls, seekh kebab rolls and reshmi kebab rolls and the rolls are also easy on the pockets priced at `50-100 range. roll durbar in gachibowli, amantran in domalguda and kolkata house in kondapur are some other places to enjoy kolkata style rolls."

Gomathi of Periyar Nagar in Erode. Dependence on non-vegetarian food has increased in the past one month from weekly once to thrice. We have to work on cost cutting measures for a balanced budget, she says.From tomatoes and small onions to even the fresh greens, prices of most vegetables are up across the region. It is the result of a combination of factors, say farmers, traders, and officials. Failure of monsoon last year and demonetisation had an impact on sowing, they say.Dharmapuri, Salem, Namakkal, Coimbatore and the Nilgiris are among the main horticulture crop growing centres in the State.Over 3,500 hectares are under tomato crop in the blocks of Mecheri, Kaadayampatti, Omalur, Pethanayakkanpalayam, Attur in Salem district. Small onion is raised in more than 4,000 hectares in Namakkal district and about 700 hectares in the Kolathur, Vazhappadi and Gangavalli blocks in Salem district.Repeated failure of monsoon resulted in standing crops withering in many parts, leading to fall in the arrival in the uzhavar santhais and open markets, say officials in Salem and Namakkal.Three kg of tomato was priced at Rs. 10 in May and now it is Rs. 60 - Rs. 64 a kg. During the peak season period, the uzhavar santhais used to receive about seven tonnes of tomatoes every day. Currently, about five tonnes of tomatoes reach the market.Following the commencement of small onion harvesting season in Salem District, there has been reasonable increase in the arrival of onion stock from the villages. The price of small onion which stood at more than Rs. 100 per kg last month, has come down. The price of good quality small onion stood at Rs. 84 and the second quality onion at Rs. 80 at the Salem Uzhavar Santhai on Sunday. The prices of tomatoes and small onions are expected to stabilise in the Salem wholesale markets once arrivals start from the nearby cultivation pockets.The shortage of rainfall and demonetisation seem to have played into the cropping area in Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts. Bathalahalli is the largest wholesale market that attracts traders from across the State and sends vegetables to Kerala too. The general fall in production of vegetables in Thally, Denkanikottai, Hosur and Rayakottai  whose farmers are the largest suppliers of cabbage, tomatoes, beans, carrots, beets, is one of the reasons for the price rise. The supply has fallen, but the demand has increased, say traders.President of Traders Association of Bathalahalli market Raja Reddy says the number of trucks loading vegetables is between 80 to 100 tonne on any day and it has remained almost the same, subject to availability of vegetables. The price of most vegetables range from Rs. 50 to Rs. 60 per kg. Beans has been going at Rs. 50 per kg for the last 6 months, he says. This year, tomato cultivation fell significantly. Its price at the market is Rs. 70 per kg, he adds. Normally, June- August witness a rise in tomato prices largely coinciding with the fall in the vegetables production in other growing regions of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.The 70-day crop was hit right when demonetisation came. Farmers, who were already mid-way into the crop and awaiting harvest, were hit. To cut down on costs, the area of cultivation was also reduced, says a Rayakottai-based farmer.In the Nilgiris, though the prices of vegetables such as potatoes and tomatoes remains extremely high, English vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, beans and beetroot, which are produced in large quantities in the Nilgiris, have not seen a steep hike in prices.According to Raja Mohammed, a wholesale vegetable supplier, the wholesale rate of broccoli currently is Rs. 130 per kg., while carrots are sold for anywhere between Rs. 35-40 per kg. depending on the quality and freshness of the produce. Beetroot is also selling for between Rs. 28 to Rs. 35 per kg., which is the usual price that these vegetables are sold for during this season.The price of English vegetables increase only during the wedding season, when they are purchased in large quantities for feasts, he says. Though the prices of vegetables such as tomatoes and potatoes are still high, there has not been a major demand for cheaper alternatives, said other vegetable sellers in the Ooty Municipal Market.(With inputs from Syed Muthahar Saqaf in Salem, P.V.

5a0ec2689855b76bf13d3f6f,From the grape wine,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/from-the-grape-wine/article19432345.ece,2017-08-05,,The Hindu,"The swish of a flamenco dancers dress, the flick of a matadors cape, the splatter of tomatoes at Tomatina  Spain is awash in 50 shades of red. Its no wonder then that its most popular wine is a ruby red from Rioja (pronounced ree-oh-hah), usually made with Tempranillo grapes.While in India, we have been familiar with the Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah (Shiraz) varieties for a while thanks to our homegrown wine industry, but Tempranillo is still a fairly new grape to us. Federico Lleonart, global wine ambassador for Pernod Ricard Winemakers was in India recently for the launch of Campo Viejo, one of the premire Rioja brands in the world, which recently dbuted in India. We spoke to him to help demystify the Tempranillo.The regionRioja is by far the most traditional, prestigious, and famous wine region in Spain. It has a DOCA appellation (qualified designation of origin), the highest regulation of quality and geographical origin for Spains products. Its largely a red wine region; but a small amount of white wine is made here too, mostly from the Viura grape, the white counterpart to the Tempranillo. As with many regions in Europe, wine production in Rioja started in the Roman times, so the region has more than 2,000 years of winemaking history, says Lleonart. Rioja rose to fame in the mid-19th century when the French producers arrived to seek an alternate wine-growing region after a severe blight destroyed the Bordeaux vineyards. Located in northern Spain, Rioja is a diverse region with three very different sub-regions. Theres the Rioja Alta, which is at a higher elevation and is known for its old-world style of wine. The Rioja Alavesa in the northwest and the smallest sub-region, which produces full-bodied wines with high acidity. Finally, the Rioja Baja, is influenced by a Mediterranean climate, leading to deeply coloured wines with a high alcohol content.The grapeRiojas signature grape is the Tempranillo. Its a very versatile grape that can produce a young, fruity wine as well as a Grand Reserva wine that has been aged for five years, says Lleonart. The range of flavours that you can get out of Tempranillo is very hard to get from other varieties. Tempranillo grapes smell like red fruits such as cherries, plums, and raspberries. Because of its versatility, it pairs well with different types of foods from meat and poultry to seafood and cheese.The brandCampo Viejo started in 1959 when three winegrowers from the region got together with the idea of producing high-quality Rioja wine. We are not the oldest or the largest winery in the region, but we are certainly the number one Rioja brand in the world. Campo Viejo exports to more than 60 countries, says Lleonart.The current winery was built in 2001 and is located just outside Logroo, the capital of Rioja. Our winery was certified as carbon-neutral five years ago. We use sustainable practices and also teach them to the winegrowers who work with us; sustainability is the only way to move forward, declares Lleonart.The winesWhile Campo Viejo has a large portfolio, it makes its debut in India with two wine variants, one red and one white, and both of them fall in the category of vin joven or young wine that isnt aged much, if at all. Campo Viejo Tempranillo is a red wine made with 100% Tempranillo grapes. Its a very fruit-forward wine, very smooth and easy to drink. Theres a smell of red fruits, a touch of liquorice, and because the wine is aged for four months in American oak barrels, theres also a hint of vanilla and coconut, explains Lleonart.It tastes fruity and fresh with low tannin. The drinkability of this wine is the key to its success in India; its a wine that will appeal to most consumers, elaborates Lleonart. The second wine is Campo Viejo Blanco, a white wine made with a blend of Tempranillo blanco and Viura grapes, that is not aged. This wine is super-new; we launched it only last year in the UK and later in Sweden, and now its in India. It is mainly made with Viura grapes but also has Tempranillo blanco, a white mutation of Tempranillo that appeared back in the 80s, says Lleonart.For a young market, and given the Indian penchant for wines that are sweeter and lighter, debuting with two fresh, fruit-forward wines seems like the right strategy for Campo Viejo. India has a great market potential and Campo Viejo is growing well around the world, so it made sense to expand into India, concludes Lleonart.Campo Viejo wines are priced at Rs. 2,000 in Mumbai.","the swish of a flamenco dancers dress, the flick of a matadors cape, the splatter of tomatoes at tomatina  spain is awash in 50 shades of red. its no wonder then that its most popular wine is a ruby red from rioja (pronounced ree-oh-hah), usually made with tempranillo grapes.while in india, we have been familiar with the cabernet sauvignon and syrah (shiraz) varieties for a while thanks to our homegrown wine industry, but tempranillo is still a fairly new grape to us. federico lleonart, global wine ambassador for pernod ricard winemakers was in india recently for the launch of campo viejo, one of the premire rioja brands in the world, which recently dbuted in india. we spoke to him to help demystify the tempranillo.the regionrioja is by far the most traditional, prestigious, and famous wine region in spain. it has a doca appellation (qualified designation of origin), the highest regulation of quality and geographical origin for spains products. its largely a red wine region; but a small amount of white wine is made here too, mostly from the viura grape, the white counterpart to the tempranillo. as with many regions in europe, wine production in rioja started in the roman times, so the region has more than 2,000 years of winemaking history, says lleonart. rioja rose to fame in the mid-19th century when the french producers arrived to seek an alternate wine-growing region after a severe blight destroyed the bordeaux vineyards. located in northern spain, rioja is a diverse region with three very different sub-regions. theres the rioja alta, which is at a higher elevation and is known for its old-world style of wine. the rioja alavesa in the northwest and the smallest sub-region, which produces full-bodied wines with high acidity. finally, the rioja baja, is influenced by a mediterranean climate, leading to deeply coloured wines with a high alcohol content.the graperiojas signature grape is the tempranillo. its a very versatile grape that can produce a young, fruity wine as well as a grand reserva wine that has been aged for five years, says lleonart. the range of flavours that you can get out of tempranillo is very hard to get from other varieties. tempranillo grapes smell like red fruits such as cherries, plums, and raspberries. because of its versatility, it pairs well with different types of foods from meat and poultry to seafood and cheese.the brandcampo viejo started in 1959 when three winegrowers from the region got together with the idea of producing high-quality rioja wine. we are not the oldest or the largest winery in the region, but we are certainly the number one rioja brand in the world. campo viejo exports to more than 60 countries, says lleonart.the current winery was built in 2001 and is located just outside logroo, the capital of rioja. our winery was certified as carbon-neutral five years ago. we use sustainable practices and also teach them to the winegrowers who work with us; sustainability is the only way to move forward, declares lleonart.the wineswhile campo viejo has a large portfolio, it makes its debut in india with two wine variants, one red and one white, and both of them fall in the category of vin joven or young wine that isnt aged much, if at all. campo viejo tempranillo is a red wine made with 100% tempranillo grapes. its a very fruit-forward wine, very smooth and easy to drink. theres a smell of red fruits, a touch of liquorice, and because the wine is aged for four months in american oak barrels, theres also a hint of vanilla and coconut, explains lleonart.it tastes fruity and fresh with low tannin. the drinkability of this wine is the key to its success in india; its a wine that will appeal to most consumers, elaborates lleonart. the second wine is campo viejo blanco, a white wine made with a blend of tempranillo blanco and viura grapes, that is not aged. this wine is super-new; we launched it only last year in the uk and later in sweden, and now its in india. it is mainly made with viura grapes but also has tempranillo blanco, a white mutation of tempranillo that appeared back in the 80s, says lleonart.for a young market, and given the indian penchant for wines that are sweeter and lighter, debuting with two fresh, fruit-forward wines seems like the right strategy for campo viejo. india has a great market potential and campo viejo is growing well around the world, so it made sense to expand into india, concludes lleonart.campo viejo wines are priced at rs. 2,000 in mumbai."

The situation is almost the same in both wholesale and retail. The best quality of onions, which was available at about Rs14-Rs15 per kg in retail markets of the city's posh areas, has now touched the Rs50 mark. However, in certain markets like Vastrapur and Vejalpur, onion was available at Rs40, which was still three times higher than its prices a fortnight ago.Explaining the shortage of onions, officials said that against the requirement of about 8-10 truckloads of onions each day, the city was getting only one or two truckloads. Each truck carries about 10 tonnes of onions.Officials said that the prices of onion at the end of July was around Rs6 to Rs7 per kg in the wholesale market, and it has increased to Rs27.50 per kg. Interestingly during the same period last year, the prices of onions ranged between Rs6 to Rs8 per kg.Deepak Patel, secretary of APMC , Ahmedabad, said, ""Last year, many farmers in Maharashtra and even Gujarat did not get adequate prices against their onion crops, and hence they didn't go for onion farming this year. This has led to a shortage of the vegetable.""Patel said it was difficult to make any prediction about the next season, but prices will most likely continue to rise. ""In Shravan, people refrain from using garlic and onion in Gujarat, but once Shravan is over, there will be a spike in demand accompanied by increase in prices,"" Patel said, adding, ""We expect onion prices to stabilize by last week of October or the first week of November, when the new crop arrives.""An office-bearer of APMC, Ahmedabad said that it was not just onion prices, but all vegetable prices have increased. Brinjals, according to quality, cost between Rs40 and Rs100 per kg in wholesale. At this time last year, tomatoes cost about one-fifth of what they cost now. Officials said vegetables in the retail market usually cost double or more than those in the wholesale market.APMC officials said that a good sign was that in the last couple of days prices had stabilized to a certain extent.

Israel also assisted India during two wars with Pakistan in 1965 and 1971.India reciprocated during the six-day war in 1967 by providing Israel with spare parts for French-made Mystere and Ouragan aircraft as well as AX-13 tanks (also French-made).The highlight of the partnership was Israel's supply of artillery shells during the Kargil war in 1999 when India faced a shortage.In the late 1990s, a crucial defence deal was the Indian purchase of Barak 1, an air-defence missile, bought specifically for its capability to intercept US-made Harpoon missiles deployed by Pakistan.India's imports of unarmed aerial vehicles (UAVs) have almost all been from Israel. Of 176 UAVs purchased from Israel, 108 are Searcher UAVs and 68 are Heron UAVs.In April 2017, India and Israel signed a $2 billion deal for an advanced medium-range surface-to-air missile system, which will provide the Indian army the capability to shoot down aircraft, missiles and drones at ranges of up to 70 km.In September 2016, tests were conducted of the jointly developed Long Range Surface-to-Air Missile with a range of 70 km, intended to equip three guided-missile destroyers of the Indian Navy.India successfully tested the Israeli-made SPYDER quick-reaction surface-to-air missile in May this year. The Indian Air Force (IAF) is planning to deploy this system on its western border.India and Israel also closely cooperate on counter-terrorism issues through a joint working group on counter-terrorism.Several ministerial and high-level official visits to Israel preceded Modi's tour.

5a0f51649855b76bf13d7e3f,are vegetable prices soaring?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/are-vegetable-prices-soaring/article19527329.ece,2017-08-20,,The Hindu,"What happened in July?July saw a rise in inflation at the wholesale level to 1.88% from 0.9% in June, with the spiralling tomato prices, along with other food items, contributing significantly to this rise. Tomatoes saw a sharp inflation of over 209.5% in July against contraction of 29.4% in June, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. Brinjal registered a rise in inflation to 21.1% in July, from Junes contraction of 3.1%. The prices of tomato, onion and potato have increased in recent months owing to disparity between demand and supply on account of a drop in production because of unfavourable weather, a rise in transport costs, seasonality and supply chain constraints.Why is supply low?While the rise in the retail prices of tomato is being associated with low supply from key growing States, including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka following heavy rain in a few regions that damaged the crop and hindered transport as well, onion prices have seen a rise on account of low supply from the southern States.The fluctuation in vegetable prices, which is commonly referred to as seasonal, is associated with the economics of demand and supply. The Centre maintains that seasonal fluctuations in market arrivals have hit supplies. The other reasons for the fall in supply are adverse weather conditions and imperfections in marketing channels. However, the clash of interests between the consumer, the producer and the middlemen is a key factor that policy-makers must urgently address.Where is the problem?For years, the consumer, the producer (farmer) and the middleman have had a clash of interest when it comes to agricultural commodities. While the consumer wants to buy a commodity at the lowest price, the producer (farmer) desires to sell the produce at the maximum price. The middleman, on the other hand, wants to maximise profits. Striking a balance among these stakeholders could possibly address the issue of price fluctuation to some extent. Vegetable producers, especially small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. As vegetables find their way to the market, the cost of packaging, grading, transporting and fees, besides the margins of the middlemen, are some of the elements that determine the final price the consumer has to bear.Will better storage help?Agricultural commodities with a short shelf-life are prone to price fluctuation and hence require better infrastructure for marketing.Economists like Prof. M.S. Sidhu at Punjab Agricultural University believe that improved transport and upgraded storage infrastructure will keep a check on price volatility. Indias cold storage capacity at present is nearly 3.5 crore tonnes, which is short by 30-40 lakh tonnes, and it needs to be increased. Besides, cold storages need to be upgraded, equipping them to store fruit and vegetables at right temperatures so that they stay fresh.Also, the high cost of transport needs to be addressed. In the case of perishable vegetables, the government could consider promoting low-cost refrigerated trucks and weigh the option of freight subsidy.According to an estimate, there are 7,000-8,000 refrigerated trucks plying in India, mostly transporting pharmaceuticals and dairy products. Transport of perishable vegetables in refrigerated trucks could be one of the options that would help in better supply and availability of the produce.What about the supply chain?The mismanagement in the supply chain is another reason for the huge gap in prices that growers sell perishable agricultural commodities for and what the consumer pays. Creation of co-operative groups and societies are probably an alternative that could assist in minimising the marketing channel. They can work in tandem across the States and supply vegetables from surplus regions to places where the produce is in demand.Most farmers in India have small landholdings. Nearly 85% farmers are small, who have less than 2 hectares. Cultivation has become unviable for these small farmers, but through cooperative groups and societies even a small quantity of crop produced by the farmer can be marketed. This will stabilise prices and benefit consumers.VIKAS VASUDEVA","what happened in july?july saw a rise in inflation at the wholesale level to 1.88% from 0.9% in june, with the spiralling tomato prices, along with other food items, contributing significantly to this rise. tomatoes saw a sharp inflation of over 209.5% in july against contraction of 29.4% in june, according to data from the centre for monitoring indian economy. brinjal registered a rise in inflation to 21.1% in july, from junes contraction of 3.1%. the prices of tomato, onion and potato have increased in recent months owing to disparity between demand and supply on account of a drop in production because of unfavourable weather, a rise in transport costs, seasonality and supply chain constraints.why is supply low?while the rise in the retail prices of tomato is being associated with low supply from key growing states, including maharashtra, madhya pradesh, uttar pradesh, himachal pradesh and karnataka following heavy rain in a few regions that damaged the crop and hindered transport as well, onion prices have seen a rise on account of low supply from the southern states.the fluctuation in vegetable prices, which is commonly referred to as seasonal, is associated with the economics of demand and supply. the centre maintains that seasonal fluctuations in market arrivals have hit supplies. the other reasons for the fall in supply are adverse weather conditions and imperfections in marketing channels. however, the clash of interests between the consumer, the producer and the middlemen is a key factor that policy-makers must urgently address.where is the problem?for years, the consumer, the producer (farmer) and the middleman have had a clash of interest when it comes to agricultural commodities. while the consumer wants to buy a commodity at the lowest price, the producer (farmer) desires to sell the produce at the maximum price. the middleman, on the other hand, wants to maximise profits. striking a balance among these stakeholders could possibly address the issue of price fluctuation to some extent. vegetable producers, especially small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. as vegetables find their way to the market, the cost of packaging, grading, transporting and fees, besides the margins of the middlemen, are some of the elements that determine the final price the consumer has to bear.will better storage help?agricultural commodities with a short shelf-life are prone to price fluctuation and hence require better infrastructure for marketing.economists like prof. m.s. sidhu at punjab agricultural university believe that improved transport and upgraded storage infrastructure will keep a check on price volatility. indias cold storage capacity at present is nearly 3.5 crore tonnes, which is short by 30-40 lakh tonnes, and it needs to be increased. besides, cold storages need to be upgraded, equipping them to store fruit and vegetables at right temperatures so that they stay fresh.also, the high cost of transport needs to be addressed. in the case of perishable vegetables, the government could consider promoting low-cost refrigerated trucks and weigh the option of freight subsidy.according to an estimate, there are 7,000-8,000 refrigerated trucks plying in india, mostly transporting pharmaceuticals and dairy products. transport of perishable vegetables in refrigerated trucks could be one of the options that would help in better supply and availability of the produce.what about the supply chain?the mismanagement in the supply chain is another reason for the huge gap in prices that growers sell perishable agricultural commodities for and what the consumer pays. creation of co-operative groups and societies are probably an alternative that could assist in minimising the marketing channel. they can work in tandem across the states and supply vegetables from surplus regions to places where the produce is in demand.most farmers in india have small landholdings. nearly 85% farmers are small, who have less than 2 hectares. cultivation has become unviable for these small farmers, but through cooperative groups and societies even a small quantity of crop produced by the farmer can be marketed. this will stabilise prices and benefit consumers.vikas vasudeva"

Some of this amount will have to be raised by the charity.Cini aims to cover 1,01,000 tribal households in four states -- Jharkhand, Odisha, Maharashtra and Gujarat -- and make them lakhpatis by 2020 by trebling their income from farming and animal husbandry to Rs 1.2 lakh per annum.In these four states, Cini covers seven blocks in five districts of Jharkhand (East Singhbhum, Hazaribag, Deoghar, Dhumka and Khunti); two blocks in one district of Odisha (Keonjhar); eight blocks in three districts of Gujarat (Mahisagar, Sabarkhantha and Dahod); and two blocks in two districts of Maharashtra (Nadurbar and Dhule).These four states are home to over 65 per cent of the nation's tribal population, Neelam said when asked why only these four states have been covered under its project.""Nearly half-way into the project, we've already created 15,000 lakhpati kisans across these four states,"" he said, adding the number of households that got lifted out of poverty through the high-value agriculture and piggery under the initiative stands at 41,313 now.Neelam said the livelihood enhancement initiative is aimed at trebling their income to Rs 1.2 lakh a year and is based on a four-pronged strategy - high value farming; livestock (primarily piggery and goats); non-timber forest produce like lac and horticulture.The initiative seeks to invest Rs 65,000 into each household of which the Tata Trusts will invest Rs 20,000 each and the rest will come through other agencies, including government grants but arranged through/by the Trusts.He sounded very confident of meeting the overall target of creating over 1.1 lakh lakhpati farmers (by 2020) as the traction in terms of adoption of their methods has been gaining better momentum.""Having already sown the seeds of change among a large number of farmers, who have become the brand ambassadors of the project, our work has become much easier now.""Total households engaged in agriculture stands at 45,740, who do at least two seasons now, while the total additional area brought under irrigation is about 4,973 acres, he said, adding total market-linked vegetable production clusters created stands at 53.While on a recent visit to the tribal-dominated Jharkhand, where Cini seeks to cover over 30,000 households, Cini state manager P Sirshendu said the success of the scheme has so far been beyond their expectation.He said in FY17 alone, more than 27,310 tribal households, spanning 429 villages and consisting of over 2020 self-help groups (SHGs), have benefited from the project.This agency has visited five villages in the Khunti district and met with dozens of farmers who do soilless farming of tomatoes and some other green vegetables.In a village in Khunti, there already are seven lakhpati farmers - all women-- who earn more Rs 1 lakh from farming and piggery. They said before they joined Cini initiatives, their lives were miserable and fully depended on the mercy of rain gods and middlemen.In another village, which is Christian-dominated and whose residents are into cultivation of lac - a natural adhesive used in industries - farmers said their lives have changed very radically after joining the Cini project.At another village, a farmer-turned-entrepreneur runs a hi-tech polyhouse nursery to grow soilless veg saplings.The farmer said he has invested Rs 7 lakh in setting up the nursery of which Rs 1 lakh was his contribution and the rest funded by the project with a condition that first he has to meet the demand from nearby villages only. He said within two years, he has recovered his investment.Cini also involves irrigation (drip and mulching), setting up solar pumps for irrigation, education and sports, especially hockey which includes a world-class hockey training academy at Jamshedpur.The academy has set a target of selecting at least 4-5 kids from the region to play in the Hockey Junior World Cup to be held in 2020.Its education initiative has resulted in dropout rate at Cini schools falling to 2-5 per cent against the state average of 12 per cent, while attendance has shot up to over 80 per cent.","mumbai: the tata trusts, the largest public charity that owns over 66 per cent in the tata group, has earmarked around rs 500 crore towards livelihood enhancement of the tribals in four states over the next five years under its flagship scheme cini.under cini, or collectives for integrated livelihood initiatives, the trusts has already spent rs 25 crore of the rs 119 crore budgeted for the project in the first phase, ganesh neelam, executive director of cini, told pti in mumbai.the project was launched under the personal initiative of chairman ratan tata in april 2015.neelam, who also heads the north and central zones of the trusts, said the organisation, as a whole, will be investing close to rs 500 crore over the next five years to fund more such projects. some of this amount will have to be raised by the charity.cini aims to cover 1,01,000 tribal households in four states -- jharkhand, odisha, maharashtra and gujarat -- and make them lakhpatis by 2020 by trebling their income from farming and animal husbandry to rs 1.2 lakh per annum.in these four states, cini covers seven blocks in five districts of jharkhand (east singhbhum, hazaribag, deoghar, dhumka and khunti);

So it's a wonderful symbiosis,"" Polman tells TOI, in an exclusive interview, amid a hectic schedule that included visits to consumers in some of Mumbai's slum areas, business review meetings and a town hall for Leverites at the FMCG major's head office based in the western suburbs.While Polman appears to be satisfied with HUL's performance, nagging competition from new players like Patanjali Ayurved has forced the FMCG giant to become more reactive. It hurriedly launched a full range of Ayush in nine months  from conceptualisation stage to national launch  in an attempt to stop Patanjali in its tracks.Couldn't HUL have been more proactive? ""If Ford knew what the car would do to a horse buggy, he would have introduced it earlier,"" says Polman, exhibiting a rather nonchalant demeanour. ""It's not important to be first, it's important to be right. All I see is making it big. Our business has doubled. We clearly saw priorities and we had opportunities in tea, ice cream, food, personal care and home care. We have had a great run to create another Hindustan Unilever. We are not dissatisfied the way the business went. Ayush has good potential in India.""There couldn't be a better endorsement for the newly launched Ayush toothpaste. Polman is a new convert and has taken back tubes of Ayush toothpaste which he sampled while in Mumbai. To that extent, Polman chuckles, he's already taking the brand ""global"". ""But we need to build the brand (Ayush) here where there is so much potential. If we see the success here, I have no doubt other countries will pick up on that. Pureit (an Indian innovation in water purifier) is a big brand in China and it's getting into other countries as well,"" says Polman.Local innovations certainly excite Polman who believes those days where consumer trends could be picked up from US and Europe to predict what would happen in markets like India, are gone.""Innovation can come from anywhere and usually from developing markets because people are more entrepreneurial here. There's also a younger population outside Europe and US. In China, the internet is far advanced than in the US. In India, Ayurveda is taking off and is an enormous opportunity. These markets are much quicker to leap frog to the best and often premium products. Here, hair care is moving towards premium more than developed markets,"" he says.On Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP), Polman says it's on track. ""If you look at our business (Unilever global), the hard numbers our share price and our returns to shareholders have been three times in this period of nine years. So our USLP is well on track and delivering on the stretched targets that we have set for ourselves. We have over half of our materials that are now sourced sustainably, 100% of tomatoes in India and about 45% of our tea is sourced sustainably, all of our factories are zero waste and we are moving quite rapidly to green energy. I think for many of these aspects because we had set ambitious goals, we have made a difference.""However, Polman, who came close to becoming a priest before he plunged into the depths of the business world, claims he is no oracle of Delphi. But some of his predictions have been bang on. When he took over as CEO of the Anglo-Dutch multinational in 2009, the developed markets were reeling under a recession. He then said 75% of Unilever's growth would come from market development, 75% will come from personal care and that developing and emerging (D&E) markets would contribute 75% to Unilever's turnover by 2020. Of these, Polman has managed to get the first two predictions right. But D&E markets are still at 60% of Unilever's turnover.""The reality is, actually more of our growth has come from the emerging markets because Europe and US have not performed that well. I was hoping we would have 75% of our business in emerging market in ten years - so I still have about 2-3 years to go on that. But we are at 60% despite having done M&A activity in developed markets (Alberto Culver, Dollar Shave club, Seventh Generation). We made these acquisitions to increase our footprint in Europe and US. If you take those acquisitions out, we would be higher than 60% (D&E percentage of total),"" he says.With weakening currency and other economic factors, emerging markets began to feel the pressure and slowed down. But the goal remains the same. ""Since 80% of the population is going to live outside of Europe and US, the bulk of the growth will come from the D&E markets. We will have the bulk of our business in D&E. When I started, D&E was 45% and now it's at 60%. You will see urbanisation continuing to be a driver in developing markets. So if we do our jobs well, we will definitely have 75% of our business in ten years in D&E,"" says Polman.Altruism comes naturally to Polman. In a world where CEO salaries are only going northwards, Polman's has remained unchanged. He believes leaders shouldn't work for money.""The moment I came into the company, I made it clear to my board that despite Unilever results, I don't want to get paid more. The reality is since I joined the company 9 years ago, I have the same salary. I get paid enough and have a great lifestyle. Salary for me is not a driver. Contrary to what people think that CEOs work harder if they get paid more is a load of baloney. All CEOs when they become CEOs already have enough money to retire. So we are volunteers,"" says Polman, who turned 61 this year and talks about his retirement have already begun.Will his successor continue with the same strategy? Polman, who had succeeded Patrick Cescau, who first talked about 'brand imprint', is not worried about USLP (Unilever Sustainable Living Plan), which he says, is by now ingrained in the DNA of Unilever. ""From the moment I joined this company, I had to think about succession. We have a much stronger bench and team leaders. We have people here like Sanjiv (Sanjiv Mehta, MD & CEO, HUL) who have incredibly challenging assignments. We have a cadre of people who could step into my job any time and continue to do successful things,"" he says.He, however, holds on to his strong views and rejects business models meant merely for ""a few billionaires"". This year, Polman successfully staved off a surprise $143-billion bid by US food company Kraft Heinz , controlled by billionaire Warren Buffet and private equity firm 3G Capital, to acquire Unilever.He believes business can actively make a positive contribution to society. ""Unfortunately, we have too many businesses only staying around now for shorter terms. The average length of a publicly traded company in the US is 17 years. It used to be 60 years,"" says Polman. The reason, according to him, is because they are just narrowly focused on shareholder and have totally forgotten what it is all about.""I would hope, as I move on, that people would say that Unilever is a model that shows business can be run differently. That it doesn't have to be to the benefit of a few, that its value and values is to the benefit of the billions and not billionaires, that you can have business play a key role in creating a sustainable and more equitable world, that business can play a key role in alleviating poverty,"" says Polman, who personally went to the White House to convince them to be part of the Paris climate deal.""We didn't succeed but I would have felt worse had we not tried,"" he says.","mumbai: paul polman , the global ceo of euro 52.7 billion unilever belongs to a rare breed of leaders who believes in inclusive capitalism . the two are inseparable for him. he talks about sustainability and growing the business with equal zeal. seven years ago, when he visited india and set a target of doubling the business while halving the environment footprint, it was considered audacious. ask him for a scorecard and he is happy to share the numbers. unilever's indian subsidiary, hindustan unilever hul ) has doubled its business during this period, while also delivering on some of the goals on inclusion, which are more long term and moving.but polman, a dutchman who previously worked with nestle and procter & gamble, believes there's enough to be done. the rs 35,000-crore maker of dove soaps and surf excel detergent , in which unilever holds 67%, looks for an encore.""i am prudently confident of the opportunity to double our business in india in the next 7 years. what we have done in the past 7-8 years is created the same business of what we have created in the previous 100-plus years. now we are going to do that again. we think the country gives us that opportunity and, actually, we are part of creating that opportunity. so it's a wonderful symbiosis,"" polman tells toi, in an exclusive interview, amid a hectic schedule that included visits to consumers in some of mumbai's slum areas, business review meetings and a town hall for leverites at the fmcg major's head office based in the western suburbs.while polman appears to be satisfied with hul's performance, nagging competition from new players like patanjali ayurved has forced the fmcg giant to become more reactive. it hurriedly launched a full range of ayush in nine months  from conceptualisation stage to national launch  in an attempt to stop patanjali in its tracks.couldn't hul have been more proactive?

5a1483029855b76bf13e50f3,Just right for the day,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170926/jsp/opinion/story_174961.jsp,2017-09-26,,Telegraph,"The first thing you eat and drink in the morning is hugely important. The beverage and food provides fuel to a body that has, usually, not ingested anything for a good few hours. The quality and quantity, the taste and the 'rightness' of the first meal also go a long way towards shaping the start of your day and possibly the whole day itself. Furthermore, that first intake also fits in with a whole cluster of morning rituals that define who you are, ethnically, culturally, socially and class-wise. Or, horror of horrors, it doesn't actually gel with your usual habits and needs, creating its own misregistration between you and the day. Or, then again, the change of morning alimentation could provide a delicious challenge to an intrepid, unprejudiced and curious traveller. In my family of three, breakfast didn't actually exist. My parents would drink tea in the morning ( desi style, CTC, milk and sugar), while listening to the radio and reading the newspaper. Watching them, I used to think the crackling pages were actually their morning nashta, though they would also snack on some non-oily, non-spicy chevdo and some biscuits. The real meal would only come in the shape of an early lunch around 11 am. They could afford to stick to this very Gujju routine because my father ran his own business and my mother taught in a college where she never had early classes. On the other hand, I had to be given fodder before school and so strategies were developed, involving fruits, Bournvita, Ovaltine, Cadbury's Hot Chocolate and toast. My Madrasi friend who lived down the road came to school having quaffed lovely home-made idli, vada and dosai, which I thought was hugely unfair. At some point, eggs and I were introduced to each other by my mother, but outside our strictly vegetarian home. By and by, I discovered the illicit, taboo-joy of meat, which meant bacon or sausages along with the eggs. There was an epiphanic moment at age 15, on the first day of my first trip to the West. Travelling with my father on a strict budget, we found ourselves in a small hotel in Paris, confronting the all-important free breakfast that came with the price of the room. I sipped on magical hot chocolate, the likes of which I'd never tasted before, and simultaneously discovered this flaky, buttery, airy thing called a croissant and the French jams that go with it. At that age I knew a tiny bit about French painting and sculpture but this breakfast was the first time I encountered Gallic culture viscerally, haptically, through touch, smell and taste, and I was left flabbergasted - no wonder they painted so brilliantly after such a breakfast. Later, I came across the comment of the great film-maker, Jean Renoir: ""the quality of the day's shooting depends on the taste of the first cup of coffee in the morning."" By this time I'd graduated through my first encounter with the French petit djeuner and had had close dealings with all sorts of different breakfasts. There was the ghastly 'dead omelette' and banana at boarding school, variations on the same theme on the Indian railways, and, in contrast, the winter joys of stuffed paranthas, achar and dahi in roadside dhabas in north India. Filming in rural Bengal, you realized that 'breakfast' was as alien a concept here as in a middle-class Gujju household, often consisting of lal chaa accompanied by chirey or dry muri with green chillies and mustard oil. Travelling in Rajasthan, the tea came with dry rotis and pickles. South India was a heaven of different kinds of home-made dosai, upmas and utthapams. In Maharashtra, the sweet Gujju tea was tweaked just that little bit with spices that made it undrinkable for someone like me, but the pohey were a revelation. In various parts of the country, people with a little bit of money were also able to bombard their stomachs, first thing in the morning, with deep fried samosas, filluries and bhajiyas. Upon travelling, all sorts of categorizations would attack the mind that was just waking up. Breakfasts were cold or hot, heavy or light, centred around sweet tastes or savoury, expansively vegetarian, with a small non-veg presence or a truckload of meat with some tiny vegetable alibis on the side; there were summer breakfasts in hot countries and then summer ones in cold countries; winter breakfasts in the tropics and winter breakfasts with icicles hanging from the window. The one hugely unhealthy thing that became a constant for far too many of us was the coupling of a cup of tea or coffee with a cigarette; this would be first thing we would touch in the morning before space was created, biologically and mentally, for any solid food. At some point in a wintry Paris very different from the one I first visited, working on finishing the post-production of a film, I was introduced to the 'French working man's breakfast', which added a shot or two of cognac to the already formidable coffee and cigarette combination. In contrast to the gut-scouring sparseness of this lunacy were the examples of extreme morning excess. At a certain young age in America, it seemed to me and my pals a fun idea to put away a stack of pancakes, two kinds of egg, sausages, bacon and hash browns plus coffee and juice, all in one eating frenzy in some diner. Across the Atlantic, the 'Full English' was no less bruising: eggs, mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, all the aforementioned pig variations plus black pudding (for those who don't know: a delicious, dark biscuit of dried beef blood). As a change from this, one thankfully came across one standard Middle Eastern breakfast which consisted of olives, hummus, various other pastes, roasted and raw vegetables, salad and pita bread. Speaking of a 'Full English', I recently found myself watching a documentary titled Secrets of the Royal Kitchen, where one got to see two kinds of breakfast being made in the British royal kitchens. One was a 'normal' breakfast for Her Maj, elaborately eviscerated discs of brioche were lightly fried to make cages for poached eggs, which were then served with sausages. The other was a reconstruction of the wedding brekker made for the union of Charles and Diana in 1981, a meal eaten by the royals and a hundred and twenty of their closest friends. Starring on the menu were quenelles of brill with a lobster sauce and a breast of chicken stuffed with a lamb mousse, coated with brioche breadcrumbs, a minted cream sauce and samphire. Somewhere else in the film it says Queen Elizabeth never travels without crates and crates of her own English bottled water. No matter where in the world, the royal tea is always made with this same water. Watching this food porn I felt no twitch of lust for all the expensive, elaborate food that was being made and displayed. One of the things that put me off was when they said no garlic at all was allowed into the royal kitchens. As one grows older the realization hits the gut: eating some things in the morning makes you happy while eating other things, no matter how delicious, can destroy your day; if you eat healthily most of the time you can indulge occasionally; a croissant is a confection of genius but it is essentially a very small, fluffy lachha parantha that's been rolled up; muesli, fruits and raw nuts are not just a fad; garlic is one of the healthiest things you can eat raw in the morning. Another realization also lands, perhaps only partly true, but I'll venture it anyway: you can mess with a person's eating habits for lunch and dinner far more easily than you can with their breakfast. Just as the first language you learn, your mother tongue, is said to be stored in a different part of the brain from all the subsequent languages you pick up, I suspect the construction and taste of one's basic breakfast is also stored in a special place. This is perhaps why I find myself craving a sada dosa or a plate of luchi-alu while looking at artisanal brioche being carved into twee little medallions.","the first thing you eat and drink in the morning is hugely important. the beverage and food provides fuel to a body that has, usually, not ingested anything for a good few hours. the quality and quantity, the taste and the 'rightness' of the first meal also go a long way towards shaping the start of your day and possibly the whole day itself. furthermore, that first intake also fits in with a whole cluster of morning rituals that define who you are, ethnically, culturally, socially and class-wise. or, horror of horrors, it doesn't actually gel with your usual habits and needs, creating its own misregistration between you and the day. or, then again, the change of morning alimentation could provide a delicious challenge to an intrepid, unprejudiced and curious traveller. in my family of three, breakfast didn't actually exist. my parents would drink tea in the morning ( desi style, ctc, milk and sugar), while listening to the radio and reading the newspaper. watching them, i used to think the crackling pages were actually their morning nashta, though they would also snack on some non-oily, non-spicy chevdo and some biscuits. the real meal would only come in the shape of an early lunch around 11 am. they could afford to stick to this very gujju routine because my father ran his own business and my mother taught in a college where she never had early classes. on the other hand, i had to be given fodder before school and so strategies were developed, involving fruits, bournvita, ovaltine, cadbury's hot chocolate and toast. my madrasi friend who lived down the road came to school having quaffed lovely home-made idli, vada and dosai, which i thought was hugely unfair. at some point, eggs and i were introduced to each other by my mother, but outside our strictly vegetarian home. by and by, i discovered the illicit, taboo-joy of meat, which meant bacon or sausages along with the eggs. there was an epiphanic moment at age 15, on the first day of my first trip to the west. travelling with my father on a strict budget, we found ourselves in a small hotel in paris, confronting the all-important free breakfast that came with the price of the room. i sipped on magical hot chocolate, the likes of which i'd never tasted before, and simultaneously discovered this flaky, buttery, airy thing called a croissant and the french jams that go with it. at that age i knew a tiny bit about french painting and sculpture but this breakfast was the first time i encountered gallic culture viscerally, haptically, through touch, smell and taste, and i was left flabbergasted - no wonder they painted so brilliantly after such a breakfast. later, i came across the comment of the great film-maker, jean renoir: ""the quality of the day's shooting depends on the taste of the first cup of coffee in the morning."" by this time i'd graduated through my first encounter with the french petit djeuner and had had close dealings with all sorts of different breakfasts. there was the ghastly 'dead omelette' and banana at boarding school, variations on the same theme on the indian railways, and, in contrast, the winter joys of stuffed paranthas, achar and dahi in roadside dhabas in north india. filming in rural bengal, you realized that 'breakfast' was as alien a concept here as in a middle-class gujju household, often consisting of lal chaa accompanied by chirey or dry muri with green chillies and mustard oil. travelling in rajasthan, the tea came with dry rotis and pickles. south india was a heaven of different kinds of home-made dosai, upmas and utthapams. in maharashtra, the sweet gujju tea was tweaked just that little bit with spices that made it undrinkable for someone like me, but the pohey were a revelation. in various parts of the country, people with a little bit of money were also able to bombard their stomachs, first thing in the morning, with deep fried samosas, filluries and bhajiyas. upon travelling, all sorts of categorizations would attack the mind that was just waking up. breakfasts were cold or hot, heavy or light, centred around sweet tastes or savoury, expansively vegetarian, with a small non-veg presence or a truckload of meat with some tiny vegetable alibis on the side; there were summer breakfasts in hot countries and then summer ones in cold countries; winter breakfasts in the tropics and winter breakfasts with icicles hanging from the window. the one hugely unhealthy thing that became a constant for far too many of us was the coupling of a cup of tea or coffee with a cigarette; this would be first thing we would touch in the morning before space was created, biologically and mentally, for any solid food. at some point in a wintry paris very different from the one i first visited, working on finishing the post-production of a film, i was introduced to the 'french working man's breakfast', which added a shot or two of cognac to the already formidable coffee and cigarette combination. in contrast to the gut-scouring sparseness of this lunacy were the examples of extreme morning excess. at a certain young age in america, it seemed to me and my pals a fun idea to put away a stack of pancakes, two kinds of egg, sausages, bacon and hash browns plus coffee and juice, all in one eating frenzy in some diner. across the atlantic, the 'full english' was no less bruising: eggs, mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, all the aforementioned pig variations plus black pudding (for those who don't know: a delicious, dark biscuit of dried beef blood). as a change from this, one thankfully came across one standard middle eastern breakfast which consisted of olives, hummus, various other pastes, roasted and raw vegetables, salad and pita bread. speaking of a 'full english', i recently found myself watching a documentary titled secrets of the royal kitchen, where one got to see two kinds of breakfast being made in the british royal kitchens. one was a 'normal' breakfast for her maj, elaborately eviscerated discs of brioche were lightly fried to make cages for poached eggs, which were then served with sausages. the other was a reconstruction of the wedding brekker made for the union of charles and diana in 1981, a meal eaten by the royals and a hundred and twenty of their closest friends. starring on the menu were quenelles of brill with a lobster sauce and a breast of chicken stuffed with a lamb mousse, coated with brioche breadcrumbs, a minted cream sauce and samphire. somewhere else in the film it says queen elizabeth never travels without crates and crates of her own english bottled water. no matter where in the world, the royal tea is always made with this same water. watching this food porn i felt no twitch of lust for all the expensive, elaborate food that was being made and displayed. one of the things that put me off was when they said no garlic at all was allowed into the royal kitchens. as one grows older the realization hits the gut: eating some things in the morning makes you happy while eating other things, no matter how delicious, can destroy your day; if you eat healthily most of the time you can indulge occasionally; a croissant is a confection of genius but it is essentially a very small, fluffy lachha parantha that's been rolled up; muesli, fruits and raw nuts are not just a fad; garlic is one of the healthiest things you can eat raw in the morning. another realization also lands, perhaps only partly true, but i'll venture it anyway: you can mess with a person's eating habits for lunch and dinner far more easily than you can with their breakfast. just as the first language you learn, your mother tongue, is said to be stored in a different part of the brain from all the subsequent languages you pick up, i suspect the construction and taste of one's basic breakfast is also stored in a special place. this is perhaps why i find myself craving a sada dosa or a plate of luchi-alu while looking at artisanal brioche being carved into twee little medallions."

Even those not knowing the language are sure that I am singing from my heart, he explains settling down for a quick lunch at The Parks Fire restaurant. When I sing in other languages, I do it phonetically but am unable to put my soul behind it. This gets translated to the audience as they know kuch toh fake kar raha hai, he quips.After a quick look at the menu, Raghu asks for Caesar salad with lots of lettuce, kothamalli pestro, baby mozzarella and cherry tomatoes while agreeing to try Andhra quinoa and beetroot, suggested by the staff. Back to the point, he observes, Before singing, I always explain the lyrics. The language barrier is only for the first few minutes then it takes a back seat as audience feel assured with our passionate singing. The other day I sang for 150 people with just my guitar and other accompaniments. Yet, I made people sing Kannada songs.He maintains lyrics are the prime reason for his bands success in India and abroad as the songs have philosophical and positive messages. I dont do it deliberately as they are already embedded in the poems on which I compose music. He explains with examples. In Gudugudiya Sedi Nodo, poet Santa Shishunala Sharif asks how does one feel after smoking hookah in which materialistic pursuits are burnt in a chillum called faith. Youngsters realising the poems gravity remark, That is really deep. Similarly, the song Lokada Kaalaji Maaduthinanthi, by the same poet says, dont worry and be happy in life. Relatable, the audience connect to it. He feels even if two out of 10 are drawn to know about these poets and their writings, he feels happy. Today, as soon as we release a new song, my hardcore fans immediately want to know the meaning.Colourful attireThe colourful and printed lungis and dhotis of band members also make Raghu Dixit Project stand out. It is a take off from what I learnt in Bharatanatyam. Its aharya abhinaya relates to costumes and make-up. I incorporated these dresses to highlight who we are. I wear bells on my feet as it is rhythmic. Moreover, the dress gives us a unique look which is unlike other groups who perform in jeans and T shirts.The Caesar salad is laid out. It is fresh and light, he remarks. Not very fussy about food, he prefers Southern cuisines like Manglorean and Chettinad. I like rasam, sambar, idli, dosa, bisi bele bath, yengai and puliyodharai. In fact, curd rice can carry me anywhere in the world. What about Andhra food? As it is spicy, I dont eat it regularly but do so when suffering from severe cold. Believe me, one meal and it simply vanishes, he jests.Describing himself a decent cook, the singer reveals he learnt the art during his bachelor days. I would call up my mother in Mysore and ask for recipes and directions. Hit and trial and pots of luck made me learn this art which though similar to singing is much tougher. Elucidating, he explains: Both need ones heart and soul and they have to be done for joy and not for commercial gains. The two help in building lasting human relationships. On our tours, fans invite us to share lunch and dinner with them. Once desperate to have rasam in New York, I posted a request on the Facebook. I instantly received 30 invitations!Surprisingly, Raghu doesnt follow a strict diet. I eat everything vegetarian, including street food, like gol gappe, chaat, dahi bhalle, vada pav and misil pav. Perceiving my surprise, he explains, The throat should get used to everything to make it immune to ill-effects. Now he is speaking like a microbiologist. For the uninitiated, Raghu is a post graduate in Microbiology and worked for years in Belgium before moving to singing. Trying the Andhra quinoa and beetroot, he reveals, I learned Bharatanatyam for 18 years and once wanted to be a professional dancer. It was a challenge by a friend to do something macho like singing and playing guitar instead of dancing that made me turn to music. I learnt to sing 500 Miles Away From Home with a guitar in two weeks flat much to the friends surprise. Then I realised what a beautiful thing it is to play an instrument and sing. I became aware I had a voice and it is nice to sing. Felt like breaking barriers and do whatever I wanted to.Appetising journeyStill stage performances, cutting albums and composing for films like Chef , was a distant dream. Working in Belgium, Raghus landlord asked him to lend his recordings. I gave him a CD of songs I had written and sung in India which he sent to Radio 21 . It was well received and I was flooded by calls and mails asking for more . That set me thinking. If I could impress people who did not understand a word of what I am singing, then things could be better. Ten days later he quit and returned to India. I had been collaborating with my friend Bhaskar and had no band. So I quickly put together one. Named Antragani, we played in front of an audience of 40000. What an experience! relates Raghu.The group was later disbanded and he formed Raghu Dixit Project which cut albums, Raghu Dixit Project and Jag Changa. The project is a novel initiative as it is an open house for people to join to collaborate and continue till they wish to. It is a fluid arrangement and outfit and is working well, he reveals.With filmmakers opting for independent musicians to score for movies, Raghu got his chance. Besides Kannada and Tamil, he composed music for Mujhse Fraaandship Karoge and Bewakoofiyaan . His latest is Saif Ali Khan-starrer Chef for which he composed and also sang songs with Shugal Laga Le becoming quite popular. Initially, director Raja Menon asked me to compose one song which I disagreed as I wanted to compose the entire score. He gave me the script and I produced scratches which he liked immensely. Describing composing for movies challenging, Raghu says, Film music is bound by its storyline, characters and situations unlike independent music. The upshot is you can reach a wider audience. The group also appeared in the film. Calling it fun, he says, Raja asked us to fly to Mumbai to perform Shugal Laga Le. Saif was absolutely cool during shooting and the scenes and song were shot much to Rajas satisfaction.One assumes Chefs popular appeal will ensure more filmy collaborations.

5a14e3fa9855b76bf13e8ceb,Wilderness on a,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/wilderness-on-a/article19904074.ece,2017-10-23,,The Hindu,"Every time Prateek Sadhu, executive chef at Mumbai-based restaurant Masque, pays the mountains a visit, he returns with close to a 100 kg of sea buckthorn, a modest Himalayan shrub with numerous medicinal benefits. Typically used by locals to construct fences, he converts the plant  also known as the Leh berry  into flavourful concoctions like citrusy-creamy sea buckthorn with black pepper mousse. Since Masques launch in 2016, exotic culinary delights  with seasonal foraged veggies like fiddleheads, wild cherries and tree tomatoes  have become top favourites among food enthusiasts. When you have such amazing produce, ideas come easily. The focus of Masque is to scale up the farm-to-table concept in India, and with people open to experimenting, the concept has caught on. Initially, our audience was restricted to Mumbai, but now travellers from across the globe recognise us as a dining destination, says Aditi Dugar, CEO, Masque.Inspired by Rene Redzepis (of Copenhagens Noma) foraging exploits, food lovers across Indias culinary landscape are bringing wild produce such as mud crabs and ghingharoo berries to city kitchens, and the trend is here to stay. According to Mumbai-based food writer, Vikram Doctor, the monsoon serves as the perfect season to forage, especially for tribal and farming communities. As they cant fish or farm, foraged food comes to the rescue of many communities who face a food crisis during this season, he says.For Pooja Pangtey and Teiskhem (Tei) Lynrah  the folks that started Mumbai-based pop-up restaurant, Meraki, last year  the art of foraging allows them to present unsuspecting Mumbaikars with a glimpse into the culturally rich kitchens of the Northeast. The knowledge handed down from our village folk has kept us connected with our culture, says Pangtey, who has introduced dishes with timila (wild figs) and kafal (red bayberries). In typical community-style dining, every edition of Merakis pop-ups follows a storytelling format where dishes like Wa khapa (Garo ginger pork) are presented coupled with a brief anecdote about their ingredients. When you read a book, you imagine what the author is trying to say. We wanted to create a similar experience, and were happy to see a change in the way locals think about what they grow, forage or eat, and what the city folk think about this type of food. Perceptions like people from the Northeast just eat a lot of meat are also changing, says Pangtey.Culture popForaging in India is anything but a new-age phenomenon, explains Doctor. We have a very long tradition of using foraged foods, and even today, women from tribal communities harbour most of the available knowledge on such edibles. Urmila Pawar, a Dalit writer from Konkan, writes about how women in her community would look for oysters on the coast; a treat they relish, he says. Foraging has also remained an integral part of religious rituals across the country. In the Angalaamman legend in Tamil Nadu, the goddess cooks a dish fromAgathileaves and chicken blood. Apparently, this dish is still prepared in certain temples as an offering to the deity, he adds.Beyond kitchensThe potent exercise of foraging isnt simply restricted to the kitchen. Kush Sethi, who heads digital communications for the Delhi Walk Festival, conducts foraging walks (between September and February). Venues include Lodhi Garden to discover edible plants  like wild amaranth and common mallow  that have been labelled weeds. Sethis motivation stems from his interest in studying weeds in an urban landscape, free from interventions like fertilisation and irrigation. Labelling a plant as a weed renders it useless and encourages people to litter in such spaces. But if someone promotes a particular plant as medicinal, the whole perception changes, says Sethi.Mumbai-based travel company, Kipepeo, also incorporates foraging walks in all its community-based tour itineraries. The idea stemmed from a conversation the founder, Piran Elavia, had with a tourist; and what followed was the creation of a product that puts the emphasis on local cuisine of the Northeast. I was surprised by the kind of vegetarian food people there forage and consume. They boil produce like the stinging nettle and flowers of the Nakima plant with rice, herbs, and some even add meat, says Elavia, who conducts foraging walks every six months.Fresh experimentsThe flavour these wild edibles lend to dishes and their presentation is what makes foraging a much-loved activity for chefs. Dugar, for instance, talks about their experiments at Masque with chestnuts. We foraged them along with the thorny shell and now have a range of dishes, like the chestnut brle served inside a chestnuts shell, chestnut and cacicovallo cheese (from Andhra Pradesh) and wild wood sorrel, explains Dugar. This foraging philosophy often finds its way to their bar as well. The bartender will try to use the same ingredients the kitchen is working with. For instance, while getting the sea buckthorn back in a carton, a lot of the juice had settled at the bottom. The bartender sieved it with a muslin cloth and infused gin-based drinks with it.Pangtey, who interacts with botanists who connect her with locals, explains how being well versed with local traditions is important, especially when exhibiting facets of a lesser known culture. In Uttarakhand, for example, there are close to 230 varieties of kidney beans. A lot of this produce is consumed by the families who grow them.Tracing the tightropeForaging, as enriching and lucrative as it sounds, presents its practitioners an equal share of challenges. The biggest being the short shelf life of the edibles.Countering this uncertainty, the people at Masque avoid getting a standard menu printed. The menu is often planned according to ingredients that reach the kitchen table. While there is a wishlist and its disappointing if we are not able to get that produce, we love the uncertainty that comes with foraging, says Dugar. For Sethi, explaining a seemingly unknown concept like foraging to commoners in order to get permissions to conduct walks, is the biggest hurdle. But weve got our secrets to deal with it! he says.Meanwhile, food historian and critic, Odette Mascarenhas says foraging demands a fair share of responsible execution. Our new-generation palate has been more open to exploration, and chefs are catering to that. But the preparations authenticity must remain intact, she insists. Though everything is subject to experiment, being the traditionalist that she prides herself to be, for her its imperative that something of the past is retained.You can reach Masque at022-2499 1010, Meraki at meraki.bombay@gmail.com,Kush Sethi, www.delhiwalkfestival.com and Kipepeo, www.facebook.com/kipepeo.india/When you have such amazing produce,ideas come easily.

5a14fe979855b76bf13e9b4b,"Fiscal recipe for growth: cut taxes, push up public spend",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/637237/fiscal-recipe-growth-cut-taxes.html,2017-10-10,,Deccan Herald,"Fiscal recipe for growth: cut taxes, push up public spendBy Ajit Ranade, Oct 10 2017, 23:59 ISTThe most important thing is to acknowledge the economic slowdown. For the past six quarters, the growth rate has steadily gone down from 9.2% to 5.7%. Investment as a share of GDP has been declining for five years. Job creation may not be just at a standstill, but sliding backwards. To some extent, this can all be viewed as the price to pay for the structural transformation of the economy. The price is paid in terms of political capital. Long-term measures have been undertaken, which have short-term costs, and can prove costly in electoral terms, too.A unified tax structure, direct linkage of farmers to buyers, attack on black money, determined effort to widen the tax net, financial inclusion, the move toward a less-cash economy are all steps toward a stronger and more efficient economic system in the longer term. But the government might be guilty of completely neglecting the here and now in pursuit of the long-term vision. After all, some of the jobs lost now are lost forever.Meals not served in restaurants during demonetisation wont come back in the future.When prices of perishables like tomatoes crash to Rs 3 a kilo, that is not compensated by better prices in the future. Many daily wage labourers who didnt find a job lost that livelihood, even if temporarily. Statistics confirm that all four basic drivers of growth (and spending) are sputtering: consumer spending, foreigner spending (that is, our exports), investment spending, and now even government spending.Economic revival is as much about psychology as about macroeconomic policy. Rising consumer and business confidence feeds off itself, and can lead to a virtuous cycle. The government and its spokespersons have as much responsibility to restore and enhance that confidence as to actually implement growth-enhancing policies. It helps to have credible promises and action plans, not just platitudes that all will be ok, this pain is only short-term.In times like these, it helps to refer to the eminent modern guru of economic policy, John Maynard Keynes. He understood that investors and consumers are as much moved by psychology as by economic incentives. Indians by nature are optimistic, as revealed by many global surveys, but that is not helping in the current times. The 80-year old wisdom of Keynesian economics still holds, despite many attempts to malign or discredit it. It is also no use being alarmist on Indias already high fiscal deficit ratio. Indias debt to GDP ratio is middling, and eminently sustainable. The pause in fiscal restraint fits in well with the new conventional wisdom put forth by worthies like the IMF in the wake of the European debt crisis.There is, of course, a price to pay for fiscal loosening. That price could be in terms of higher taxes in the future (to pay for new debt), or higher inflation. Both of these are acceptable costs. The unborn generation will bear a lower per-capita burden of taxes because of our demography. We can afford a slightly higher inflation rate, given that it has undershot even the RBIs target band.Finally, it is unfair to pin all our hopes on monetary loosening, and ignore the fiscal possibilities altogether. We need a well thought-out, well designed and implemented fiscal push now, not later.Revival packageSo, here is a list of fiscal options recommended as a much-needed timely fiscal package. First, recapitalisation of public sector banks. Burdened by NPAs, they are simply not in a position to extend new loans. This has caused credit growth to fall to the lowest in decades. The incremental credit-to-deposit ratio is deeply negative. Of course, we need not give the banks a blank cheque, so to speak. The recapitalisation could be tied to conditions and milestones, such as a time-bound resolution of top 10 NPAs, or speedy decisions on haircuts on stressed loans.The second area of fiscal priority is lower taxes. The corporate sector awaits the lower rate of 25%. More importantly, the excessive excise taxation on petrol and diesel must be reversed. Granted, it is in the domain of state taxes and that it lies outside the ambit of the GST council, but we need urgent relief on petro taxes. These are indirect taxes; they hurt the poor more than the rich, are regressive, do not give GST offset credit, and feed into generalised inflation through higher logistics and energy costs. Theres no point in filling the coffers of the governments and oil companies, and denying the benefits to the citizen.The third area is affordable housing. That will need a subsidy, mostly in land cost and interest subvention. The land should be acquired by governments (thats where thesubsidy comes in), and housing loan interest rate can be reduced. The state of Kerala has a successful pilot which can be emulated. Maharashtra is also implementing a large project, which includes rental housing, too.The fourth priority is a wage subsidy, especially for labour-intensive sectors like textiles (weaving, spinning, garment-making), construction and tourism. The state of Odisha has successfully innovated a scheme for garment makers which can be emulated. The NREGA can be extended to the textile sector. Wage subsidy and national accreditation should be given to apprentices, too, because most of the skilling is actually done as on the job training.A fifth priority is exporters. The issue of delay in GST refund has already been flagged. An expansion of the MEIS and SEIS schemes could be looked into. The fate of manufacturing and the export sector are interlinked.The sixth priority is farm incomes. Raising the MSP is a much-politicised issue. But there are crops outside the ambit of MSP. The government must examine ways of providing floor price support, although this helps only farmers with surplus to sell. There are many other specific measures to address the immediate need to rev up the economy. A fiscal push, in terms of lower taxes and higher government spending is an imperative.(The writer is an economist and senior fellow, Takshashila Institution)(The Billion Press)","fiscal recipe for growth: cut taxes, push up public spendby ajit ranade, oct 10 2017, 23:59 istthe most important thing is to acknowledge the economic slowdown. for the past six quarters, the growth rate has steadily gone down from 9.2% to 5.7%. investment as a share of gdp has been declining for five years. job creation may not be just at a standstill, but sliding backwards. to some extent, this can all be viewed as the price to pay for the structural transformation of the economy. the price is paid in terms of political capital. long-term measures have been undertaken, which have short-term costs, and can prove costly in electoral terms, too.a unified tax structure, direct linkage of farmers to buyers, attack on black money, determined effort to widen the tax net, financial inclusion, the move toward a less-cash economy are all steps toward a stronger and more efficient economic system in the longer term. but the government might be guilty of completely neglecting the here and now in pursuit of the long-term vision. after all, some of the jobs lost now are lost forever.meals not served in restaurants during demonetisation wont come back in the future.when prices of perishables like tomatoes crash to rs 3 a kilo, that is not compensated by better prices in the future. many daily wage labourers who didnt find a job lost that livelihood, even if temporarily. statistics confirm that all four basic drivers of growth (and spending) are sputtering: consumer spending, foreigner spending (that is, our exports), investment spending, and now even government spending.economic revival is as much about psychology as about macroeconomic policy. rising consumer and business confidence feeds off itself, and can lead to a virtuous cycle. the government and its spokespersons have as much responsibility to restore and enhance that confidence as to actually implement growth-enhancing policies. it helps to have credible promises and action plans, not just platitudes that all will be ok, this pain is only short-term.in times like these, it helps to refer to the eminent modern guru of economic policy, john maynard keynes. he understood that investors and consumers are as much moved by psychology as by economic incentives. indians by nature are optimistic, as revealed by many global surveys, but that is not helping in the current times. the 80-year old wisdom of keynesian economics still holds, despite many attempts to malign or discredit it. it is also no use being alarmist on indias already high fiscal deficit ratio. indias debt to gdp ratio is middling, and eminently sustainable. the pause in fiscal restraint fits in well with the new conventional wisdom put forth by worthies like the imf in the wake of the european debt crisis.there is, of course, a price to pay for fiscal loosening. that price could be in terms of higher taxes in the future (to pay for new debt), or higher inflation. both of these are acceptable costs. the unborn generation will bear a lower per-capita burden of taxes because of our demography. we can afford a slightly higher inflation rate, given that it has undershot even the rbis target band.finally, it is unfair to pin all our hopes on monetary loosening, and ignore the fiscal possibilities altogether. we need a well thought-out, well designed and implemented fiscal push now, not later.revival packageso, here is a list of fiscal options recommended as a much-needed timely fiscal package. first, recapitalisation of public sector banks. burdened by npas, they are simply not in a position to extend new loans. this has caused credit growth to fall to the lowest in decades. the incremental credit-to-deposit ratio is deeply negative. of course, we need not give the banks a blank cheque, so to speak. the recapitalisation could be tied to conditions and milestones, such as a time-bound resolution of top 10 npas, or speedy decisions on haircuts on stressed loans.the second area of fiscal priority is lower taxes. the corporate sector awaits the lower rate of 25%. more importantly, the excessive excise taxation on petrol and diesel must be reversed. granted, it is in the domain of state taxes and that it lies outside the ambit of the gst council, but we need urgent relief on petro taxes. these are indirect taxes;

5a15411b9855b76bf13ec9c4,Doctor on board Tejas Express recalls journey: ‘It was the biggest test of my 34-yr experience’,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/doctor-on-board-tejas-express-recalls-journey-it-was-the-biggest-test-of-my-34-yr-experience-4897396/,2017-10-19,,Indian Express,"Sanjay Nimbalkar and his daughter, Pranjal. Narendra Vaskar Sanjay Nimbalkar and his daughter, Pranjal. Narendra VaskarSANJAY NIMBALKAR (57), a general physician for 34 years, claimed that his skills and experience were tested the most during the nine-hour travel in the Karmali-Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) Tejas Express on Sunday. His biggest challenge was to calm down passengers on board the train, in which 24 passengers had to be admitted to the Life Care hospital in Chiplun after they complained of food poisoning.Nimbalkar, who was travelling in the chair car compartment on Sunday, along with his wife and daughter, recalled the journey when two of the co-passengers complained of nausea and stomach pain. We had just finished with our tomato soup at 12.30 pm when someone came calling out to check if there was any doctor in the train. When my daughter and I told them that we were medical practitioners, we were told about two passengers who complained of stomach pain and nausea. By the time we attended to them, the situation had become intense, said Nimbalkar, who runs his clinic in CBD Belapur in Navi Mumbai.The doctor recalled that when they began attending to the ill passengers, other passengers were already in a state of confusion and panic. While many suggested to halt the train at that given spot, a few even reached to pull the chain in the train, he said. We had just left Ratnagiri railway station when the incident happened. The next halt was at Chiplun railway station, at least two hours away. After giving the required medication to a few passengers who complained of nausea, we realised nothing was going to work on them till they get the required medical care in a hospital. So, we tried our best to convince the passengers that the train needs to run till we reach a specific halt, added Nimbalkar.The father-daughter doctor duo added that they did not have their stethoscopes or other accessories with them as they were returning from a four-day holiday in Goa. By checking the pulse of ill passengers and through analysing their symptoms, Nimbalkar said, they tried to identify the problem and spread a word of caution to others. We saw the relatives of passengers were surrounding those who were ill, suffocating them further. This was followed by switching off the air-conditioner in the coach as many complained of the vomit smell that had spread across coaches. We asked them not to surround the ill passengers and allow them to breath freely, said Nimbalkar. While a few of those taken to the hospital blamed the food served in the train, which they claimed was smelly, the Nimbalkars claimed they were satisfied with the quality of food that was served to them.After the train halted at Chiplun station for two hours, we resumed the journey at 2.30 pm. I had my lunch at around 4.30 pm without having any issue with the quality of food served. Many other passengers too had their lunch, said Nimbalkar. I am not a judge to say whether there was any problem in the food.

Forty of the 294 passengers, travelling to the city from Karmali in Goa on Sunday, were rushed to the Life Care hospital in Chiplun after the train was stopped there. Twenty-four of them had to be admitted to the hospital. But on Monday morning, all of them were discharged and transport arranged to send them to Mumbai, said railway officials.According to senior railway officials, the committee spoke to passengers, the AC mechanic, the train conductor and ticket examiners to find out the reason for the passengers throwing up as the initial suspicion was on the food served on the train. Food on Tejas not reason for passengers taking ill: RailwaysIt emerged that two groups of tourists were travelling in the affected coach, one from Himachal Pradesh and the other from Kolkata. Two children travelling with the group from Himachal Pradesh first vomited in the coach. The smell and sight caused uneasiness among the other passengers and then two more children threw up. Then two more children vomited, triggering a vomiting spree in the compartment, railway officials said.The IRCTC has served a showcause notice to catering contractor J K Ghosh. The area officer of the IRCTC at Madgaon and the onboard manager too were placed under suspension. The inquiry on them is still under way. The caterer has been supplying food in the premium train for three months.A committee comprising the senior divisional commercial manager of the CR, additional chief medical superintendent, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and additional general manager, IRCTC (Western zone), was formed to inquire into the episode. Feedback about the quality of food was taken from passengers, almost all of whom said the food served was satisfactory. Food samples were found to be within their expiry dates, said a statement from the railways.Of the 294 passengers onboard the Tejas Express, 230 were served breakfast consisting of omelette, cutlet, tea, coffee and juice at 9.30 am followed by tomato soup at 12.30 pm. Passengers reported not feeling well from 12.30 pm onwards.The railways statement quotes the tour manager of the group from Kolkata, Kajal Chakravarti, who said there was no problem with the food quality. As many as six passengers of the 16 from the group from Himachal Pradesh and six others from the group of 23 travelling from Kolkata fell ill on the train. Food poisoning could have been caused by food eaten days in advance or by bacterial infection, which can develop days later. This may have triggered the first two cases of vomiting. The uneasiness and smell caused the other passengers to throw up, said a member of the committee.It is true that food poisoning could be caused by bacterial growth after consumption of stale food over a period of days. The same is referred to as gestation and the poisoning may be triggered after consumption of other meals. However, as many as 40 passengers feeling nauseous due to the air-conditioning in the coach is something which should be checked, said Manish Deliwala, a general physician based out of Chembur.The Food and Drug Administration of Maharashtra said they were not sent any food samples from the meals served on the train for testing.

The agriculture ministry thinks so and is hunting for commercially viable proposals in 12 pre-identified areas.The Narendra Modi governments Startup India scheme, which has a Rs10,000 crore war chest managed by the Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi), is seeking to incubate farm-solution startups through a contest called Agriculture Grand Challenge.I urge young entrepreneurs to participate in our newly launched Agriculture Grand Challenge and join forces to make agrarian sector technologically sound and commercially viable, farm minister Radha Mohan Singh said. The idea is to enable entrepreneurship and innovation, he said.A handful of startups for the rural economy are already a part of the growing ecosystem. India has more than 19,000 startups, led by consumer Internet and financial services apps, according to the Economic Survey 2015-16.From 220 in 2014, the number of startups funded in the first 10 months of 2017 stood at 482, according to data from Tracxn.As of December 2015, eight Indian startups belonged to the so-called Unicorn category, a club of ventures valued at $1 billion or more. Yet, fewer than 10% of these cater to the farm or social sector, according to Tracxn.A government document, which Hindustan Times has reviewed, states that private-sector startups could offer viable interventions in an array of areas, notably linking farmers to markets and offering extension services. It seeks to rev up an emerging niche area thats being dubbed as farming as a service, or FAAS.Proposals are being invited for simplified, sensor-based quick testing of soil samples as well as real-time assaying and grading of food commodities in electronically linked eNAM markets. The government has linked 470 mandis electronically but many of them lack crucial infrastructure: food labs to test samples being brought to these markets. The prospective app should preferably enable sample tests under two minutes to promote online trade.The government is interested in apps to connect food processors with agripreneurs and growers, an official said. To help price discovery, the ministry is looking at price forecast apps for pulses, oilseeds, potato, onion and tomato at the time of sowing since these crop are vulnerable to price volatility.According to the document, the success of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Indias main farm insurance scheme, depends on accurate yield estimates at village and farm levels for which it wants to incubate digital technologies.Another priority area is custom hiring of farm machinery and cheaper disposal of crop residue that has become a major reason for pollution in the national capital from neighbouring states during winters.Under the programme, commercially viable ideas will be incubated at the governments expense for three months. The last date for applications is January 15, 2018.Given the high penetration of Internet-enabled mobile phones, this is a good idea that can drive down cultivation costs, said Ashok Duggal, one of the promoters of VentureIndia Labs.A crop of startups aimed at harnessing the rural economy has made inroads already. AgroStar, a Pune-based mobile-commerce firm, directly sells farm inputs to farmers in Maharashtra and has raised more than $4 million.

This is precisely what the worldwide tour Bhairav Se Bhairavi Tak being undertaken by renowned vocalists, Pandit Rajan and Sajan Mishra, which commenced from Varanasi recently, signifies. We were seized of the ongoing violence and terrorism world over, which only harms humanity without serving any purpose. Wondering what to do, we decided to propagate peace and brotherhood through our music, explains Rajan Mishra as we settle down for a quiet lunch at Shangri-Las Eros Hotels Tamra restaurant. Agreeing Sajan Mishra, adds, music has tremendous power to move human hearts.We ask for green tea to be followed by som tam, the Thai papaya salad. The staff suggests tomato and bocconcini sandwich to which they readily agree. As in music where we keep exploring ragas, we also experiment with food too, quips Sajan Mishra.Power of musicOne wonders as to how music can help? The entire planet and nature is enveloped in music. Our voice is sound or swara and the heart and pulse beats are layas. Nobody is beyond music as it strikes a chord with all living beings instantly. In fact, the whole cosmic energy moves in rhythm. We have formed rapport through music with even those who do not know our language. In Paris, the audience approached us for autographs with tears rolling down their eyes. Such is the power of melody, relates Rajan Mishra.Sajan Mishra cites the example of their concert at Maastricht, Holland, where audience did not clap. Wondering what went wrong, we were later informed by them that they did not want to disturb the harmony created by the music. That is one of the best compliments we have been paid ever.Has singing given them tranquillity? Besides name and fame, it has given a spiritual dimension to our life making us at peace. Be it riyaaz or concert, we remember Goddess Saraswati and our forefathers and seek their blessings and start. Closing our eyes we are lost and sing to our satisfaction ensuring the audience follows and they do. Recently at Delhi Universitys Shivaji College, we sang for three hours without any student leaving the hall.Driving home the point, Sajan Mishra recalls that once they rushed from a Ganesh Utsav recital at Pune to Mumbai to catch a flight to Malaga in Spain for another show. We did not sleep a wink. Reaching the venue, we splashed water and changed into fresh clothes. We were bone tired yet on the stage with tanpura and tabla as accompaniments, we felt no fatigue and gave a memorable performance.So will this whirlwind tour involve long concerts encompassing all ragas from Bhairav to Bhairavi. Sajan Mishra expounds: We are talking about the whole spectrum and bouquet of ragas and not necessarily from early morning to evening. In lots of places, there are issues concerning audience, auditorium, timings, or security and so keeping those in mind we have worked out various permutations and combinations to bring fore the flavour of ragas. In Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Delhi and Bengaluru, we are doing two concerts, morning and evening just as in Houston. In London we will start at 1 p.m. Adding Rajan Mishra says, Bhairav is an important raga which is sung at dawn just when sun rays start dissipating darkness, has mircotones of Rishabh and Dhaiwat being used. There are several types of Bhairav like Lalit, Ahir, Bairagi and Nat. Bhairavi, a ragini of Bhairav, uses many surs and shudh surs and brings down curtain on a performance. His short demo of the two have heads turning around in awe and admiration.With sandwich and salad being laid, we take a break. Tasting them, the two approve much to the delight of the staff. Bahut achha hai, remarks Rajan Mishra, who loves food and is eager to taste all things new. I like almost all regional cuisines, be it Gujarati, Rajasthani, Uttar Pradesh, Punjabi or South Indian. My favourites include dal-chawal, khichdi, khandvi, undhiyu, rohu fish, bhaat-jhol, dosa, idli, paniharam and appam. Food like music is a labour of love and brings happiness, satisfaction and peace to one making as well as eating. Sajan Mishra, prefers food from UP, Rajasthan and Punjab. They are rich in taste. These regions offer great variety like dal bati choorma, kachhi methi ki and sangria ki subzis, different parathas and dahi.When asked if he cooks, Rajan Mishra replies promptly: Mujhe toh nimbu bhi katna nahi ata. He quietly lets it slip in that Sajan Mishra is a fabulous cook reputed for his dal and chicken preparations. I never had formal training and dont depend on recipes. Having observed my mother and chachi, I started out when we had to fend on our own in Delhi many years ago. Recalling what I had observed, my first attempt yielded delicious dal and gobhi subzi. The bhindi I did not realise had to be washed before being cut. It didnt get cooked despite several helpings of ghee and oil. Our friend sarod player, Ashok Roy and his wife, dropped in. They enjoyed dal and gobhi and quietly ate the bhindi without any comment, quips Sajan Mishra.Such is his love for food that at Vlodrop, Holland, during a tour organised by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, on finding the food placid, Sajan Mishra, decided to use some tadka in the dal and vegetables. I purchased ginger, garlic, chillies and other condiments and decided to use the electric kettle. About to start, Maharishis nephew Girish dropped in unexpectedly. Getting the fragrance, he remarked, Can we also have some of this, and I said join the party. Once, Ritesh, my nephew, requested for kadhi, which I had never made before. With everything ready, I used the curd in the fridge and later the whole place was filled with a strong aroma of strawberry. Investigating I found myself staring at the red kadhi as I had used strawberry curd. Quietly, I dumped it far away. No wonder, they say, raag rasoi pagdi kabhi kabhi bandh jaye (music, food and pagdi sometimes turns to be excellent), he chuckles loudly.On a serious note, Rajan Mishra, is appalled with the burden of studies on children these days. In our time, we studied, played, indulged in pranks and also bunked to watch movies. They couldnt be serious. We had been caught and punished too. Our gurus, grandfather, Bade Ram Das Ji Mishra, father, Hanuman Prasad Mishra and uncle, Gopal Prasad Mishra insisted that sports is required to keep fit and healthy. They insisted on complete concentration, singing with heart and soul instead of treating it as a drill. That helped us to do well in studies too. While Rajan Mishra has a masters degree in sociology, Sajan Mishra graduated from Banaras Hindu University.With great masters at constant attendance, it must have been advantageous. Yes, we were helped by nature and nurture but they never favoured us. The taalim was without fear or favour. They instructed us to listen to other great masters and imbibe their qualities. So we learnt the grasp on sur from Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, while Ustad Vilayat Khan, sitar maestro taught us that the tempo of laya and taan should always synchronise, replies Rajan Mishra.New generation singersTalking about the new generation of singers, Rajan Mishra says, They are extraordinarily talented. All they need is stay away from diversions like mobile, television, internet and computer. Forgetting about updating Facebook, they need to concentrate on studies and music. Rajan Mishra loves to teach while Sajan Mishra fills in his absence. Main unko workout karata hoon, bhai sahib daud lagwate hain (I give workout while brother makes them run), he jests making Rajan Mishra smile.With the brothers declining desserts, one wonders if is a precautionary measure? No, we love khoye ki mithai, sandesh, Banarasi jalebi and sohan halwa, replies Rajan Mishra, and as for precaution, you will be surprised we eat everything. Finding me surprised, he says, Eating is closely related to psychology. The moment you think gol gappa pani will affect the throat, it will. We eat everything bindaas  chutni, aachar, papad, chaat, bhel puri, dahi bhalla, pav bhaji, sev puri, ice creams and drink chilled water. It has never affected our voice. Sajan Mishra adds, Riyaaz cleans up everything.

5aeb244e9855b7179ad71a46,Fields of despair,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/indian-farmers-rural-economy-bjp-fields-of-despair-4973039/,2017-12-08,,Indian Express,"Rural India has lagged behind the cities since the 1991 economic reforms. (Express Photo: Gurmeet Singh) Rural India has lagged behind the cities since the 1991 economic reforms. (Express Photo: Gurmeet Singh)Bharat vs India, a phrase coined by Charan Singh to describe the conflict between villages and cities, remains relevant. This is evident from the Kisan Sansad (farmers parliament) that met in Delhi last month. More than 40,000 peasants belonging to 180 farmers organisations came together to form the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC).Rural India has lagged behind the cities since the 1991 economic reforms. According to the National Sample Survey, the average Monthly Per Capita Expenditure (MPCE) in 1993-94 was Rs 281 in rural India and Rs 458 in urban India. It rose to Rs 772 (up 174 per cent) and Rs 1,472 (up 221 per cent) for rural and urban India respectively in 2007-08, which means that the gap between rural and urban jumped from 63 to 91 percentage points. The gap diminished somewhat between 2007-08 and 2011-12, with rural MPCE reaching Rs 1,430 (up 85 per cent) as an average and the urban rising to 2,630 (up 79 per cent), but it remained more than 20 percentage points higher than what it was in 1993-94 at 84 percentage points.This is partly due to the slow growth of agriculture over the last decade. Between the years 2005-06 and 2011-12, the average annual growth rate of industry at constant 2004-05 prices has been 7.5 per cent, while services grew at an ever-quicker pace, 9.95 per cent. However, agriculture lagged behind at 3.8 per cent. In the following three years, 2012-2015, the average agricultural GDP growth rate was 1.7 per cent. In 2014-15, the growth rate of agriculture was negative at  0.2 per cent. It was only 1.1 per cent in 2015-16 and, thanks to a good monsoon, about 4 per cent in 2016-17, the growth rate the five-year plan considered as necessary to ensure food security.Different factors are responsible for these changes. First, the size of holdings has shrunk over the years: The average land owned by peasants fell from 0.725 ha to 0.592 ha between 2002-03 and 2012-13. As a result, the proportion of those owning less than one ha increased from 79.7 per cent to 82.8 per cent. Since a farm household needs at least 1 hectare of land to make ends meet, over half of the farmers are in debt: The average loan amount for a farm household in India today is Rs 47,000. Second, irrigation has stagnated with less than half of Indian farmland irrigated, partly because of the groundwater crisis: Water tables fell by 65 per cent in 10 years. Third, peasants suffer from one obsession of the government: The price of food. To neutralise any risk of inflation on that front, the growth rate of rural wages has been limited  in 2015, it was the lowest in 10 years (and lower than the inflation rate). That was related to the squeezing of the MGNREGA programme, which was blamed for rising rural wages. But more than wages, food prices were targeted. To spare urban consumers, they were kept low and the government even precipitated food prices deflation by allowing imports. Soyabean is a case in point, when this year market was flooded with cheap soyabean oil imports. Though the government can impose duty up to 45 per cent, but it kept the rate at 12.5 per cent.In 2017 summer, farmers across India started agitating for better prices. They wanted the M.S. Swaminathan Commission report, which recommended minimum support prices, to be implemented. Maharashtra farmers demanded better prices for onions and other pulses; in Himachal Pradesh, it was for tomatoes; in Punjab and Haryana, it was potatoes and maize; in Rajasthan, garlic; in Gujarat, groundnuts; in Madhya Pradesh, soyabean; in Andhra, Telangana and Karnataka, chilli and so on. In June, when Maharashtra farmers, who were on strike, took out a march to Mumbai, the BJP government agreed to a Rs 30,000-crore loan waiver. The protest spread to Madhya Pradesh, where five people were killed in Mandsaur district in police firing. Farmers mobilised also because of demonetisation, which badly affected rural India.Though the agitation fit the traditional pattern of kisan politics, the mobilisations, unlike in the previous decades, achieved little. Loans were waived for peasants, mainly in Maharashtra and UP. However, this measure didnt help much. The procedure to receive reimbursement is bureaucratic and the amount waived is sometimes minimal (Rs 10 to Rs 500). Besides, only a third of the small and marginal farmers have access to institutional credit: Banks do not lend money to the poor. The others turn to money lenders, who do not waive loans. Besides, loan waiver is only a temporary relief.Why did the peasant mobilisations achieve so little? The reason could be the urban consumer bias of the BJP, the new political hegemon. The party has turned its back to the Gandhian dimension of Deendayal Upadhyayas Jana Sangh and is focussed on urban development, as evident from the smart cities flagship programme. It sees industrialisation as the best way to modernise India and create jobs. More urban dwellers supported the party than villagers in the 2014 election  by 10 percentage points, according to the CSDS-Lokniti survey. The urban bias of the government was obvious in its attempt to amend the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2015 in favour of industrialists. When the Opposition forced the government to backtrack, Prime Minister Modi invited the states to reform and the BJP-ruled states were the first to change the law.Budget cuts have reduced the spending on the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana and the Integrated Watershed Management Programme and Accelerated Irrigation Benefits and Flood Management Programme. In this context, it isnt surprising that 40 per cent of Indian farmers do not like to farm any more. Hence the demand among young Patels, Marathas, Jats and Kapus for reservations in the (urban) public sector.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App","rural india has lagged behind the cities since the 1991 economic reforms.

5aeb75099855b73f522c9b80,"To get best spots, hawkers pay up to Rs 20,000/month to ‘seths’",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/to-get-best-spots-hawkers-pay-up-to-rs-20000/month-to-seths/articleshow/61732320.cms,2017-11-21,,The Times Of India,"MUMBAI: Whether you're a businessman buying a 2,000 sqft flat or a hawker renting 20 sqft of space illegally, nothing matters more in this city than location. Profits can vary drastically depending on where a hawker is located while fruits and vegetables sell fast in largely vegetarian localities, items like 'Chinese bhel' are a big hit around schools and colleges. And in a business district like Fort, mobile cases and earphones are always in demand.In an effort to deconstruct the world of street peddling, TOI interacted with several hawkers from across the city. Most of them admitted to paying a premium to squat illegally on a prime spot. On Bandra's Linking Road , for instance, which boasts department stores, fast-food chains and hordes of pedestrians, hawkers are willing to pay as much as Rs 20,000 per month.This money isn't used to bribe a BMC official despite the fact that the hawker is squatting on a public footpath. Instead, explains a local politician, it finds its way into the hands of local 'seths' and 'sahabs' with political connections, who have ""captured"" this location illegally and are now sub-letting it for a fee. The more the footfall in an area, the more those controlling the space demand. If a hawker is unwilling to pay, the space is immediately given to the next person in line.Irfan Chand (name changed), who sells maxi dresses, found this out two years ago when the BMC evicted him from his original spot outside Jogeshwari railway station. ""I started searching for another space, and I found this spot at Andheri , but I was told that it belongs to someone already,"" says Chand. ""I now have to pay him Rs200 every day for doing my business here.""Hawkers dot the footpaths outside railway stations because commuters have to walk to and fro, providing them with a captive clientele. BMC officials have been trying to clear these areas to reduce congestion but have found it to be an uphill task. ""The lakhs of people who travel by local trains prefer picking up fruits and vegetables on their way home instead of heading to a market,"" says a BMC official. ""This makes our job even more difficult as people patronize these hawkers."" On the other hand, hawkers complain that the BMC's eviction drives negatively impact their business.Some, however, do brisk business anyway, making as much as Rs50,000 a day. Dharmen Gupta sells imported fruit outside Santacruz railway station and earns Rs40,000 per day though he claims his profit is only Rs2,000-4,000. He explains that this is because fruits are perishable and so if they don't sell, he has to offload them on another fruit seller at the wholesale price.Food items often sell in places where there are many schools, colleges and restaurants. These lanes often become unofficial 'khau gallis'. Bandra corporator Asif Zakaria says that the KFC lane, off Bandra's Linking Road, has seen a huge spurt in the number of hawkers selling fast food even though cooking on the road is strictly prohibited. But hawkers are willing to break the law because of the spiking demand. Babloo Raja, who sits outside Dadar's St Paul's High School, remembers selling 'Chinese bhel' for Rs5 just five years ago. Now, a plate is Rs15.The price of goods and their quality also varies in different locations. At Kurla market, for instance, tomatoes sell for Rs55-60 a kg but they can't match the quality of those sold at Andheri's Lokhandwala market for Rs70. And in residential localities, hawkers have loyal customers. ""Ours is a family business. Therefore most of our customers are old- timers from the locality, says Jeetendra Tripathi, who sells fruits at Vile Parle market.(This is Part 2 of a series on hawking in Mumbai. Tomorrow: In Part 3, we tell you about the 'protection' involved in the business and the money which exchanges hands)","mumbai: whether you're a businessman buying a 2,000 sqft flat or a hawker renting 20 sqft of space illegally, nothing matters more in this city than location. profits can vary drastically depending on where a hawker is located while fruits and vegetables sell fast in largely vegetarian localities, items like 'chinese bhel' are a big hit around schools and colleges. and in a business district like fort, mobile cases and earphones are always in demand.in an effort to deconstruct the world of street peddling, toi interacted with several hawkers from across the city. most of them admitted to paying a premium to squat illegally on a prime spot. on bandra's linking road , for instance, which boasts department stores, fast-food chains and hordes of pedestrians, hawkers are willing to pay as much as rs 20,000 per month.this money isn't used to bribe a bmc official despite the fact that the hawker is squatting on a public footpath. instead, explains a local politician, it finds its way into the hands of local 'seths' and 'sahabs' with political connections, who have ""captured"" this location illegally and are now sub-letting it for a fee. the more the footfall in an area, the more those controlling the space demand. if a hawker is unwilling to pay, the space is immediately given to the next person in line.irfan chand (name changed), who sells maxi dresses, found this out two years ago when the bmc evicted him from his original spot outside jogeshwari railway station. ""i started searching for another space, and i found this spot at andheri , but i was told that it belongs to someone already,"" says chand. ""i now have to pay him rs200 every day for doing my business here.""hawkers dot the footpaths outside railway stations because commuters have to walk to and fro, providing them with a captive clientele. bmc officials have been trying to clear these areas to reduce congestion but have found it to be an uphill task. ""the lakhs of people who travel by local trains prefer picking up fruits and vegetables on their way home instead of heading to a market,"" says a bmc official. ""this makes our job even more difficult as people patronize these hawkers."" on the other hand, hawkers complain that the bmc's eviction drives negatively impact their business.some, however, do brisk business anyway, making as much as rs50,000 a day. dharmen gupta sells imported fruit outside santacruz railway station and earns rs40,000 per day though he claims his profit is only rs2,000-4,000. he explains that this is because fruits are perishable and so if they don't sell, he has to offload them on another fruit seller at the wholesale price.food items often sell in places where there are many schools, colleges and restaurants. these lanes often become unofficial 'khau gallis'. bandra corporator asif zakaria says that the kfc lane, off bandra's linking road, has seen a huge spurt in the number of hawkers selling fast food even though cooking on the road is strictly prohibited. but hawkers are willing to break the law because of the spiking demand. babloo raja, who sits outside dadar's st paul's high school, remembers selling 'chinese bhel' for rs5 just five years ago. now, a plate is rs15.the price of goods and their quality also varies in different locations. at kurla market, for instance, tomatoes sell for rs55-60 a kg but they can't match the quality of those sold at andheri's lokhandwala market for rs70. and in residential localities, hawkers have loyal customers. ""ours is a family business. therefore most of our customers are old- timers from the locality, says jeetendra tripathi, who sells fruits at vile parle market.(this is part 2 of a series on hawking in mumbai. tomorrow: in part 3, we tell you about the 'protection' involved in the business and the money which exchanges hands)"

An equivalent of this popular scene from Yash Chopras Kala Patthar (1979) is playing out simultaneously in a car at a drive-in theatre with don Raees (Shah Rukh Khan) ordering a mill owner to give the neighbourhood workers their rightful wages.Its a scene that puts in a nutshell one of the many things that Rahul Dholakia is trying to do with SRK in Raees  making him play a version of the Angry Young Man of the 70s and the 80s. Quite like Big Bs Vijay, Raees is anti-establishment, an outlaw and also a Robin Hood figure.Raees is the Vijay of Gujarat where business is so paramount that even prohibition leads to its own illicit trade shoot-offs, where bootlegging is a strong commercial force thriving on a political nexus. The subversive streak is visible right from the start when the voiceover says  pabandi bagawat ki shuruaat hoti hai (imposing restrictions leads to rebellion). Where there is a will there has to be a way. So you have alcohol-shot tomatoes on sale and liquor consumed in tea cups.Along with all of this, Dholakia also channels the early dark avatars of SRK  in Baazigar and Darr . But what is most interesting is how he sets up Raees within a religious and community context.In Raees, SRK and Dholakia would rather dare than play it safe. The character, ostensibly based on the life of criminal Abdul Latif, walks on the razors edge. Its a complicated portrayal. Some would complain of a whitewash regarding the alleged Dawood and Mumbai blast linkages. But it is in line with grounding SRK in his faith, and making him rise above it.We begin with a person who puts business above religion and doesnt intend to harm others. Betrayals lead him to cross over to the dark side. More severe transgressions  like encouraging rioting and violence  follow. Yet he is also the  masiha  (messiah) who feeds the needy and affected.He is parallel government to the community. Yet he is not a superman, a man who uses the system as much as he is used; who kills yet cries at his failure to provide housing to his community. Raees is more of a Shakespearean tragic hero, so is his fall. The moral compass remains intact; transgressions are not denied. There is no escaping guilt either.  Mohalla bachate bachate shehar jala diya (In trying to save the neighbourhood I set the town afire, he says.The adversary, cop Jaideep Ambalal Majmudar (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), gets an equal play. Its a cat-and-mouse game between equals. In fact, with his poker-faced humour, sharp lines and Michael Jackson entry, Siddiqui gets to play to the gallery more than SRK himself and remains one up on him throughout. There are some nice touches, like Majmudar snooping on the love chat between Raees and his wife. He is human after all. The supporting cast shines. One only wishes there was more of Sheeba Chaddha and Loveleen Mishra.If it is Gujarat, can Gandhi be far behind? Early on in the film, there is a lovely scene of Raees stealing a pair of spectacles from the Gandhi statue because he cant afford to buy a frame for himself. The doctor asks him to put the glasses back on the statue and gives him another pair, a pair that eventually comes to stand for entirely the opposite of Gandhis vision of non-violence.

As the government will not be in a position to announce a waiver at least for a few months, it has swung into action to ensure the indebted farmers are not hassled in getting a loan for seeds, fertilisers and pesticides essential for sowing, which will begin in first week of June, immediately after monsoon sets in. The government is thinking of purchasing seeds and fertilisers and distribute them with the help of NGOs and social organisations.The Opposition has been batting for a loan waiver for farmers similar to the one given in Uttar Pradesh. The Congress, NCP and four smaller parties boycotted proceedings of the Assemblys budget session for three weeks to push the demand. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had declared that his government, too, was in favour of the waiver, but at an appropriate time. He said his government was studying the UP model of a waiver. He also said that rather than a waiver, the thrust would be on sustainable development of agriculture.To reduce expenditure on farm labourers, the government is mulling funding them from the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS). We have not been able to fully utilise the central funds allocated under NREGS, but on the other hand, the cost of farm labourers is unbearable for farmers. By funding farm labour, we can extend a great relief to the farmers helping them to reduce cost of production. Similarly, on other fronts, too, we are tapping the possibilities to extend the benefits to the farmers, said an official from the agriculture department.The cooperation department is planning to restructure the loans given to the farmers to enable them to get fresh loans for the kharip season. The government is also considering health, education and housing schemes in the package so that the socio-economic burden is reduced.It will be a package of various schemes by 3 to 4 departments to ensure farmers are heavily subsidised to bring farming to the level of affordability. Right from testing of the soil health, sufficient supply of water, power supply at subsidised rates to effective marketing of the agriculture products, we are planning to do everything that will minimise the gap between the production cost and the rate in the market, Subhash Deshmukh, cooperation minister, told HT.The government is also tapping the idea of bring about 22 crops in the list of produce with minimum support price. It will bear the cost of difference between the market price and the MSP, particularly for crops such as tomato, onion and grapes, whose rates have fallen this year. Our aim is to bring cost of production to zero for about 1.07 lakh farmers who hold less than 5 acres of land. Instead of giving them money, the government will purchase the things required to cultivate and distribute with the help various organisations working in the sector, the officer said.According to rough estimates, the schemes will cost around Rs10,000 crore if implemented. But the estimates are primary, and depends on the feasibility of the all schemes being tapped. The schemes could be implemented if the government wins over the demand of the loan waiver, which is expected to cost Rs30,500 crore. But it succumbed to pressure for the waiver. It will have to cut short the schemes, another official from the cooperation department said.Read: Sangharsh Yatra: Waive loan before farmers lose patience, say Maharashtra opposition leadersMaharashtra Opposition intensifies attacks on govt, kicks off second Sangharsh Yatra for farm loan waiver","under tremendous pressure from the opposition to approve a loan waiver for farmers, especially after a similar announcement in uttar pradesh, the state government has begun to package multiple schemes to reduce the cost of production of the crops and also ensure assured price for the crops.at least three government departments, including agriculture, cooperation and revenue, are working together to package various schemes. as the government will not be in a position to announce a waiver at least for a few months, it has swung into action to ensure the indebted farmers are not hassled in getting a loan for seeds, fertilisers and pesticides essential for sowing, which will begin in first week of june, immediately after monsoon sets in. the government is thinking of purchasing seeds and fertilisers and distribute them with the help of ngos and social organisations.the opposition has been batting for a loan waiver for farmers similar to the one given in uttar pradesh. the congress, ncp and four smaller parties boycotted proceedings of the assemblys budget session for three weeks to push the demand. chief minister devendra fadnavis had declared that his government, too, was in favour of the waiver, but at an appropriate time. he said his government was studying the up model of a waiver. he also said that rather than a waiver, the thrust would be on sustainable development of agriculture.to reduce expenditure on farm labourers, the government is mulling funding them from the national rural employment guarantee scheme (nregs). we have not been able to fully utilise the central funds allocated under nregs, but on the other hand, the cost of farm labourers is unbearable for farmers. by funding farm labour, we can extend a great relief to the farmers helping them to reduce cost of production. similarly, on other fronts, too, we are tapping the possibilities to extend the benefits to the farmers, said an official from the agriculture department.the cooperation department is planning to restructure the loans given to the farmers to enable them to get fresh loans for the kharip season. the government is also considering health, education and housing schemes in the package so that the socio-economic burden is reduced.it will be a package of various schemes by 3 to 4 departments to ensure farmers are heavily subsidised to bring farming to the level of affordability. right from testing of the soil health, sufficient supply of water, power supply at subsidised rates to effective marketing of the agriculture products, we are planning to do everything that will minimise the gap between the production cost and the rate in the market, subhash deshmukh, cooperation minister, told ht.the government is also tapping the idea of bring about 22 crops in the list of produce with minimum support price. it will bear the cost of difference between the market price and the msp, particularly for crops such as tomato, onion and grapes, whose rates have fallen this year. our aim is to bring cost of production to zero for about 1.07 lakh farmers who hold less than 5 acres of land. instead of giving them money, the government will purchase the things required to cultivate and distribute with the help various organisations working in the sector, the officer said.according to rough estimates, the schemes will cost around rs10,000 crore if implemented. but the estimates are primary, and depends on the feasibility of the all schemes being tapped. the schemes could be implemented if the government wins over the demand of the loan waiver, which is expected to cost rs30,500 crore. but it succumbed to pressure for the waiver. it will have to cut short the schemes, another official from the cooperation department said.read: sangharsh yatra: waive loan before farmers lose patience, say maharashtra opposition leadersmaharashtra opposition intensifies attacks on govt, kicks off second sangharsh yatra for farm loan waiver"

Fascinated by the idea of having their own garden, the students immediately swung into action. Each class is divided into four sections and each division was assigned four gardens each.In a concrete jungle like Mumbai, a terrace garden awakens a sense of environmental consciousness and becomes a forum for knowledge.

We neither able to sell the vegetable nor to take it at home, Jaipal Singh Munda, a tomato farmer, said.Jagdish Mahato, a trader at Bhuinyadih wholesale market, said, Tomatoes and French beans are being sold at Rs 1-2 a kg in the market while cauliflower is Rs 5 a piece for last few days.However, the price of tomato is Rs 6-10 a kg, French beans and cauliflower Rs 10 in vegetable markets in Ranchi city.With good monsoon this year, farmers have produced bumper crops in the country.Traders purchasing power has declined after demonetisation. They have restricted their orders. West Bengal traders are not coming to buy vegetables from Jharkhand at this time, said Nakul Mahato, a vegetable grower from Ranchis Pithoria area, who also sells vegetables to West Bengal.State horticulture director Rajiv Kumar said Jharkhand recorded bumper crops this year. So, it is natural the demand will fall. We are trying to increase the demand through advertising significance of tomato on health.He said residents would be requested to buy tomato and store them as ketchup.Next year onwards, vegetable route will also be defined where farmers will be requested to produce different vegetables so that farmers do not see such situation, he said.Jharkhand is a known for surplus vegetable production. According to Jharkhand state horticulture mission (JSHM), the state produces around 38 lakh metric tonne vegetables annually against a requirement of 30 lakh metric tonne. The state exports around one million tonne vegetables to other states every year.","distressed vegetable farmers across jharkhand have been forced to dump their produce due to the steep fall in wholesale prices, apparently due to bumper crop this season.haripal bhagat (48), a tomato farmer from huddu village in lohardaga district, dumped three quintals of the vegetable after he was forced to sell the produce at rs 50 per quintal.bhagat rued that he had spent rs 20 on transportation and rs 20 on meals, but the poor return on the vegetable was only around 10% of the production cost.i decided to dump the production to avoid transportation and other costs, he said.bhagat is not alone. farmers of bhandra, kero, kuru and senha blocks of lohardaga district and in ranchi and other parts of the country uttar pradesh, andhra pradesh, maharashtra and madhya pradeshhave been dumping their tomatoes, onions and french beans.huge dumps of vegetables were seen along ranchi-tata highway (nh-33) near bhuinyadih vegetable market in ranchis tamar block after having been forced to sell their produce at throwaway prices because of bumper crop and cash crunch.the national institution for transforming india (niti) aayog in a recent paper admitted to the slump in vegetable prices, but attributed it to the bumper crop and not demonetisation of rs 500/1000 notes.we are in catch-22 situation. traders are not buying our produce. we neither able to sell the vegetable nor to take it at home, jaipal singh munda, a tomato farmer, said.jagdish mahato, a trader at bhuinyadih wholesale market, said, tomatoes and french beans are being sold at rs 1-2 a kg in the market while cauliflower is rs 5 a piece for last few days.however, the price of tomato is rs 6-10 a kg, french beans and cauliflower rs 10 in vegetable markets in ranchi city.with good monsoon this year, farmers have produced bumper crops in the country.traders purchasing power has declined after demonetisation. they have restricted their orders. west bengal traders are not coming to buy vegetables from jharkhand at this time, said nakul mahato, a vegetable grower from ranchis pithoria area, who also sells vegetables to west bengal.state horticulture director rajiv kumar said jharkhand recorded bumper crops this year. so, it is natural the demand will fall. we are trying to increase the demand through advertising significance of tomato on health.he said residents would be requested to buy tomato and store them as ketchup.next year onwards, vegetable route will also be defined where farmers will be requested to produce different vegetables so that farmers do not see such situation, he said.jharkhand is a known for surplus vegetable production. according to jharkhand state horticulture mission (jshm), the state produces around 38 lakh metric tonne vegetables annually against a requirement of 30 lakh metric tonne. the state exports around one million tonne vegetables to other states every year."

(AP Photo/Rajesh Kumar Singh) Rag pickers look for reusable materials at a garbage dump littered with polythene bags in Lucknow. (AP Photo/Rajesh Kumar Singh)The challenge of solid waste management in Indian cities is now receiving belated but welcome attention and about time too. Rising incomes and changing lifestyles are generating more waste and of a different kind, but we are yet to set up systems to deal with the build-up. Swachh Bharat Mission provides an opening, but much more needs to be done on the ground.Waste was not such a problem in India until the 1970s. In our rural areas, food discards were returned to the soil. Food leftovers were fed to animals and the cattle-shed wastes were thrown in a pit to decompose and become manure for the next planting season. This returned both NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) nutrients as well as micronutrients to the soil for healthy crops.Urban food discards were also recognised as a potential resource, not a waste. In Portuguese Goa, bullock carts would move from bungalow to bungalow, collecting kitchen leftovers for on-farm composting. This was the earliest Indian version of doorstep waste collection. In big cities like Bangalore, farmers would bring their produce to town for early-morning auctions, then move to the cement-ring waste bins at street corners and empty them to take back home and produce manure. In fact, they would fight over collection rights for this fertile resource. This age-old practice kept Indian soils rich in carbon, up to 4 per cent.All this changed with the beginning of the plastic era in the 1970s. Some readers will recall how plastic bags were initially cherished as a useful item for hoarding in our homes, carefully taken out for re-use when needed. As the bags became more common, poor quality, and disposable, we began throwing them away into our kitchen waste-bins. When farmers took such mixed waste to their farms, the fields wore a non-biodegradable plastic film, preventing rain from entering the soil and keeping seeds from germinating through them  an example of negative urban-rural connectivity.Two useful resources, biodegradable waste and plastic, when mixed together, became waste and remained uncollected. Add to this the mixing of other dry waste and the debris from construction and demolition down the supply chain of waste, and this assorted mixed waste presents a major management challenge for the municipal authorities.City managers forced to deal with this growing waste began collecting and dumping the same outside the city limits. Since nearby farms and villages did not want this mixed waste either, it often ended up along the sides of roads leading out of town. These convenient ribbons of no mans land were not managed or defended by anyone. When even these filled up with ridges of waste, cities found larger areas outside to create mini hills of mixed waste.These rotting heaps of waste, denied oxygen from the air, emit methane (CH4) which is over 21 times more potent as a heat trapping gas than carbon dioxide. They generate ammonia which smells like dirty urinals and nauseating hydrogen sulphide which smells like rotten eggs. The airless heaps also produce leachate, a black liquid oozing out from the waste. Imagine a rotten tomato in a plastic bag which turns to a smelly liquid, unlike a similar rotten tomato which is left in the open air and dries to powder. This example illustrates the importance of aerating the waste heaps.Waste heaps without adequate exposure to air take 25-30 years to slowly decompose, continuously releasing methane and leachate. This leachate seeps down into the soil and contaminates open wells and after a longer time even reaches and pollutes bore wells through deep natural water channels. When waste is dumped in low-lying areas or quarry pits, the hydrostatic pressure of so much water-logging forces the leachate into water veins even faster. There is no way to treat this deep underground contamination, which makes wells and bore wells unfit for drinking and even for irrigation for decades.Households need to be made to stop mixing biodegradable waste with dry waste (paper, plastic, glass, etc) and keep hazardous domestic waste completely separate. The segregation of waste at source into wet (compostable), dry (recyclable) and sanitary (disposable diapers and sanitary napkins) categories is now compulsory for all citizens of India in the Solid Waste Management Rules 2016. However, residents typically complain that the waste is mixed again in the door-to- door collection process. While demanding high standards for door-to-door collection, we must continue with our discipline at home.In 2003, Suryapet in Andhra Pradesh was the first Indian city to process its wet waste, recycle its dry waste and leave nothing for landfilling. Vengrula in Maharashtra and Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu are the latest of over 20 urban local bodies to achieve near zero waste to landfill. The wet waste needs to be collected and processed daily, either composted at home or taken to nearby locations for decentralised composting or biogas production or taken to centralised plants. At the very least, the waste needs to be stabilised as described below. The correct way to manage fresh waste is to expose as much of it to air as soon as possible. Worldwide, the standard way of doing this is to unload the waste in windrows, not high heaps.Windrows are long low parallel heaps of waste, not more than two metres high, which are designed to achieve the best conditions for aerating the waste. Only parking-lot type management is required to guide incoming vehicles on where and how to unload their waste, moving slowly forward and leaving the waste behind in a long row. Enough space is left between rows for a lifting tractor or earthmover to drive through and turn the waste in the windrow.The outer aerated waste should form the inner core of a new windrow, and the airless centre of the old heap now on the outside. Weekly turning of the waste, repeated at least four times, ensures that all parts of the waste are fully decomposed, like leaves on a forest floor, turning dark brown and with a sweet earthy smell. The process can be speeded up by the addition of composting bio-cultures (fresh cow dung or substitutes available in the market).Fresh waste windrows heat up inside, to about 55C to 60C in three to four days. After four turnings, there is about 40 per cent weight loss as moisture content declines and also about 40 per cent volume reduction. After this, no leachate or methane or smelly gases are released, and this fully stabilised waste is called compost, rich in microbes as well as humus, both wonderful for soil vitality.This bio-stabilising of biodegradable waste makes a city fully compliant with the SWM Rules 2016. Screening makes it more farmer-friendly and helps move useful fractions offsite to ensure continued long-term use of the same site for waste processing. The recycling of existing waste management space is one of the biggest advantages of waste stabilising and frees local bodies from the constant search for new sites to pollute and new urban rural battles over locations for waste processing.Ahluwalia is chairperson, ICRIER, Delhi, and former chairperson of the high-powered expert committee on urban infrastructure and services.

The retail price, however, has remained more unchanged.While green peas prices have spiraled to Rs 40-45/kg in wholesale market from Rs 25 on Wednesday, pushing the retail price to Rs 70-80/kg from the earlier Rs 50-60, the low supply of capsicum from Palghar due to the recent unseasonal rain has pushed up the wholesale rates to Rs 30-35 a kg from 25-30. Capsicum is currently retailed at Rs 60-70/kg from Rs 50-60 earlier.However, tomato prices have dropped to Rs 20 from Rs 25-30/kg in the wholesale market, bringing down the retail price too to Rs 40-50/kg from Rs 50-60 on Wednesday. It was sold at Rs 40-55 in Andheri.Onion prices rose in wholesale market despite the arrival of 125 trucks on Thursday, said potato-onion wholesale trader Ashok Walunj. APMC received just 30 trucks on Wednesday as against 110 trucks on Tuesday. However, the prices had remained unchanged with poor turnout of retailers. The rates are expected rise further and then stabilize in the next couple of weeks. While red onions were retailed at Rs 45-50/kg at Andheri-Versova, old onions were sold at Rs 55-60.Experts say the recent showers may have affected the quality of onions. Even a days non-seasonal rain can cause a lot of damage to the crop that is being harvested. The quantum is yet to be ascertained; a clear picture will emerge by next week, said Manohar Totlani, a trader. The harvest may get delayed by almost a week due to wet ground conditions, where farmers avoid collecting the crop.Early this week, wholesale onion prices had dropped to Rs 25-30/kg from Rs 30-35, attributing to arrival of fresh crop armed with the Centres cap on export by raising the minimum export price. But after the unseasonal showers on Monday and Tuesday, the prices have shot up yet again. Vegetable prices will remain uncertain till this weekend. The picture will be clear by Monday when the quantum of damage crop is expected to come to fore, said Balasaheb Badade, a trader.Mumbaikars are worried about the rising prices. Kandivli resident Abhijeet Thakur said, There has been no relief from expensive vegetables for the last few months. We have reduced the quantity to adjust the kitchen budget.
